in the Indictment and the Pearl Necklace This Poulter the Prisoner if our Instructions are true charged the Colonel with secreting these Goods It is surprizing that a Reflection of this Kind should be

Goods of Colonel Dalrymple Gentlemen there was Advertisements to get at the Knowledge of these Things but it lay buried a long Time till at last they thought there would be no more said about it We shall produce the Gentleman that bought the Goods of this Man Council for the Defendant My Lord I apprehend in all these Cases it is necessary to set forth the literal Words as they are in the former

Diamond was taken The Ring that he insisted upon having again I put a Crystal in and sent it to him Q What did you give for them Hendrick I gave him 25 l for the two Rings and one Diamond Q What can

unhappy Brother-in-law in the Gate-house at that Time he sent me a Letter that there was a Gentleman had some Diamonds and Pearls to sell When I came I said to my unhappy Brother Who is the Gentleman And he said it was the Turnkey I said I did not care to buy of such People he said I might for he gave great Security and he had married a Wife with a Fortune and they were to take a great Inn and they had bought fourteen Beds already and had a Mind to part with these Things At first he shew d me a single Diamond so says he if you come in a Day or two I shall have one bigger Accordingly I came in a Day or two so then he shewed me all the three and he said one of them was a Family-Ring that he must not part with that Q Do you know any Thing of the Woman Hendrick When I came she had one of them on her Finger Q to William Dalrymple Esq Sir do you believe that all or any of these Pearls that are here produced are your s Dalrymple Not above two or three and thirty of these Pearls were mine I believe they are mixed I believe that Part of these were taken by Matthew Henderson As to the other Jewels the two Rings I am positive to them I have had them for sixteen Years as to the other it might be in the Possession of my poor Wife but I cannot tell whether it was or no I believe there was forty-six Pearls but two were taken off that Necklace was bought of the Charitable Corporation and cost 147 l Q to Hendrick How came you to buy these Things so that cost 141 Pounds Hendrick could say but little in Answer to this Question Q to Robert Dalrymple Esq Was you before Justice De Veil Robert Dalrymple Upon the 25th of March I was desired by Captain Dalrymple to go to the House and take care of the two Servants that were supposed to be guilty of the Murder I afterwards carried them before Sir Thomas De Veil and they were severally examined and it appeared upon some Circumstances that Matthew Henderson had been guilty of the Robbery and Murder At last Henderson owned he had stolen the Things before Poulter and Poulter the Prisoner was sent to Henderson s Wife s Lodgings for the Box in which were these Things and there was a small Box put into the large one in the Presence of Poulter at that Time the great Box was produced before the Justice but the little one was not Q to Sarah Callow Do you know the Prisoner Poulter What Profession is he of Callow He was the Turnkey of the Goal when Henderson was in Custody Q Had you any Discourse with him about the Goods stolen by Henderson Callow I never had any Discourse no farther than at the Time that Henderson was in Custody he came to lock up the Goal and he brought up the Boy to my Husband who is a Debtor there he brought him up to lie with him My Husband said What bring up Murderers to lie with them The Prisoner Poulter said he could not help it he also said he had taken an Instrument out of the House of Office that his Lady was killed with Poulter told this to my Husband and I Q From whose House of Office Callow That he had taken a Hatchet or Cleaver I cannot say which from the Captain s House and that he had been at the Boy s Wife s Lodgings to fetch a Box and said there was two or three Rings and a Necklace and said with an Oath he believed Sir Thomas De Veil had them Q Did you ever see them in his Possession Callow Yes I have had the Rings several Times in my Hand I had the Curiosity to look at them About five Months ago there was a Man committed for Felony that had formerly been great with Mr Poulter and he loaded him with Irons The Man wanted a Letter to be wrote to some Friend whilst the Letter was writing he asked me if I saw Mrs Poulter go out To-day dressed I said what was she dressed in and he spoke of the Rings I said that was no new Thing I had seen that before So the Man said if he could get clear of that he would blow him for they belonged to Captain Dalrymple So when I saw them again I was confirmed that they were Diamonds and I thought I would go to Captain Dalrymple to speak to him about it Q Do you believe these to be the Rings she wore Callow My Lord I believe they are Q Is that Woman the Prisoner reputed to be Poulter s Wife Callow Yes my Lord she goes for his Wife but several Women have come and claimed him for their Husband besides her Prisoner My Lord please to ask her what that Prisoner s Name was Callow He is gone beyond Sea I cannot tell his Name but the Woman has frequently wore these things he has often beat her for wearing them she wore them and has washed her Hands in them she has threatned him that she could swear a Smack of Robbery against him as she used to term it Council for the Prisoner First in Point of Law I would submit to your Lordship how far the Evidence can affect the Prisoner as to make him accessory to this Felony as receiving them knowing them to be stolen The Gentlemen in the opening of the Matter they have been pleased to say that there were two Ingredients that went to this Matter to induce the Court to believe the Prisoner knew these things to be stolen - The first is charging Sir Thomas De Veil with it the next Place going to Henderson s Wife s Lodging that this was presumptive Proof that these things were stolen As to one Part we shall only observe that the Prisoner went with the Constable to take care of Henderson as he was his Prisoner the Constable went with him and brought the Box corded before the Justice The Prisoner further urges in his Favour to shew his Innocency that he did not know these things to be stolen that from the first Time he found the things she wore them constantly Q to Joshua Brogdon As you were Sir Thomas De Veil s Clerk when there was a Warrant granted to search Henderson s Lodgings did the Constable go with Poulter Was the Box brought back corded Brogdon When the things were missing the Rings and Necklace Sir Thomas asked Poulter if he knew any thing of them Henderson confessed that he had stolen them and that the little Box was put into the great Box Henderson was so strictly searched that it was impossible it should be about him for his Shoes and Stockings were taken off that he could not secret any thing Q to Enock Stock What is your Profession Stock A Clog-maker Q Do you know at what Time you first saw any Jewels or Rings that Poulter found Stock As we were cleaning the Goal I saw Parker story and take up something and I cried out Halves Q Did he not show you what it was Stock I saw them publickly in the Goal but I did not know the Value of them nor he neither Q How came you in the Prison Stock I was sent there for an Assault he brought them from under the Gateway where he throwed the Beads Q So he shewed to all the Prisoners what a Lucky Day he had Stock I have seen them lay in the publick Goal for half an Hour together Q Who is the Keeper of the Goal Stock Mr Davage Court Did all the Treasure that was found in the Goal all belong to the Turnkey Martha Stock I went to the Goal to carry my Husband some Victuals just as the Door was opened he threw the Dust out and he took up something and opened it and I saw the three Rings and loose Beads Q What Time was this Stock As near as I can guess the latter End of May or the beginning of June as I went to carry my Husband his Breakfast Q Who threw the Dust out of the Prison Stock Poulter Q Did not your Husband cry Halves Stock Yes he did Q How came he not to insist upon it What did your Husband find Stock A Silver Cork skrew Q Did you see the Woman with these Rings Did you not think the Rings would become your Finger as well as Mrs Poulter s when your Husband cried Halves Stock He would not part with them out of his Custody Rachel Browning I was going to the Gate-house to pay Mr Poulter 3 s 6 d that I owed him and he took a Bit of Leather out of the Dirt and he said he had found something and there was three Rings and a Necklace Q Did you see him throw out the Dust Browning I did not see him empty the Dust but I saw him pick the Things up There was three Rings and Beads Q What Time was this Browning It might be about Noon or two or three o Clock I cannot justly say the Time The Prisoner s Witnesses were very contradictory in their Accounts particularly Martha Stock she says it was in the Morning when she went to carry her Husband s Breakfast the Prisoner pick these Things up she said it was about one or two or three o Clock that she saw him take these Things out of the Dust that he threwed out Farther his Witnesses say it was the beginning of June that these Things were found when the Witness Callow swears she saw the Rings upon his Wife s Fingers the beginning of May Elizabeth Bradbury otherwise Poulter acquitted John Poulter guilty Transportation See summary

Horses &c FRIEND HARRY I very much fear you have quite forgot me as this is the only time of the year if we should let it slip I shall be at a loss any other time of the year If you intend any thing you have promised come to action that I at once may know what I have to depend upon and you will greatly oblige your humble servant JOHN GRAHAM March 27 1757 Q In what manner did you understand that letter Rowley I understood by it that having so many times ask d me to get fish it was to spur me up to go and get some but I could not tell where to get any Q What did you do next Rowley The first action of this sort was we went to Twickenham-Common that was I believe the 10th of April the next was at my lord Vere s at Hanworth that was either the 14th or 15th of April we took a horse and cart from Mr Graham s which was left there on purpose Q Who went with you Rowley John Hanson did We went out about nine at night with some hay or straw in it Q Was this with Graham s knowledge Rowley It was We told him we wanted straw to keep the fish alive we also took a wicker basket or flasket of Mr Graham s to put the fish in we got to Hounslow between nine and ten and had two pints of hot at the White-Bear there and staid a little because we thought it was not late enough I believe we got to the pond a little after ten Q Describe the situation of the pond Rowley The pond is betwixt two houses in the back street of Hanworth town within about a quarter of a mile of the park side or thereabouts we put the cart and horse on the side of the road at the distance of about twenty-five or thirty yards from the pond and gave him some hay then we took the nets and put them into the pond and went about half way round where we found a great root or limb of a tree in the middle of the pond Hanson pull d off his cloaths went in and pull d it on shore till such time as I could get hold of it then I drag d it on shore After that we got the net out with a pretty quantity of fish There were about twenty-two brace of carp and tench together there were also about one dozen and a half of perch We put them all into the wicker basket Then we saw a woman open a door and look out with a light and a man on the other side then I said to Hanson bear a hand quick We put them into the cart upon the straw which he brought to the place while I was getting the fish out Then we drove away to Hounslow and so to the prisoner s house at about two in the morning there was nobody to receive them so we put them into Mr Graham s stews according as he had ordered us he came down about six o clock Then we went to weighing the fish with his stilliards We had seven store carp which we put into his pond I can t be particular as to the largeness The killable fish we put into his stews according to his order where they may be catch d in a quarter of an hour s time Q What did the fish weigh Rowley I can t tell nor how much money we received I know we did not receive it at that time Q Did the prisoner say any thing to you as to the better management of the fish when he was not present Rowley He ordered us to come to the Park a private way because we had like to have been blown and he shew d us a well concealed in which to put the fish he put a stick down it and I remember he said it was a pretty convenient place to put a bastard child in Cross Examination Q What are you Rowley I am a fisherman Q Does not the prisoner buy and sell fish Rowley He has for many years Q Has he not advertised to buy fish honestly come by Rowley He did that for a blind to this Q Was not that pond advertised to have been rob d Rowley I don t know it was advertised there was a rumour that it had been rob d Q Did not Graham come to you soon after and call you to an account where you got this fish and say he hoped you had not them from thence Rowley No he did not I went to him and told him a man told me my lord Vere s pond had been rob d He said he hoped I did not do it Q What answer did you give him Rowley He said further Why had you not taken the poker and beat his brains out had he came to me I would If you have done any thing amiss more than you can answer you must take care of yourself Q How can you tell that this pond is my lord Vere s property Rowley I can t tell that it is Q What is the price of carp per pound Rowley I believe about 9 d per pound but he had all the killable and store fish at the same price Q Can you buy carp of a common fisherman fit to come to a gentleman s table for 9 d per pound Rowley No Q What is the price of tench and perch Rowley They are worth 18 d per pound Q Did he ever mention my lord Vere s pond to you Rowley No never he said in general any ponds where we could and said he had as much right on the waste as the earl of Northumberland had Q What could you have sold those fish for at market Rowley There were some worth three or four shillings a brace Q Did you tell him they were stolen fish Rowley No Q Whether on the 15th of April it was not excessive cold weather Rowley It was very frosty Q Why did you carry the fish in the night time Rowley For fear any body should see us and we had nets kept at Mr Graham s conceal d on purpose and it was usual with us to have the horse and cart at his house ready Q Did he ever charge you any thing for the keeping of the horse Rowley No not a farthing He sent Hanson to rent the river of the earl of Northumberland on purpose to blind the thing Q Was you apprehended for this Rowley I heard I was to go before justice Birkhead I was sent for and I went and made a confession free and voluntary the same as now John Hanson In the beginning of April last Mr Graham sent his servant for me I went and he desired me to go a fishing for him he said he d get another to go with me to carry the net I told him I was afraid to go he said I had no occasion at all to be afraid I ask d him where I was to go he said upon Smallberry Green and I was to take my horse and cart Q In whose mannor is that Hanson My lord of Northumberland s mannor I went home again and the next day he sent for me again and said he could get no body and desired me to get somebody at the mill to go with me I went there but the men appear d to be in liquor so it was put off till he got Rowley to go with me Then he sent for Rowley and me and we were both at his house together the next day which was the 9th of April Rowley and I went to Twickenham Common and brought some fish from thence to the prisoner s house The next time we went out was two or three days after when we went to Hanworth he told us he would give us 9 d per pound for all killable fish carp tench perch &c Q Was any mention made by the prisoner of Hanworth Hanson No not as I know of I had left my horse and cart at Graham s house from the first action and when we went to Hanworth I took them and a basket and some straw and the net from Graham s house We set out a little after nine at night Graham said he d leave the gate open for us that we might go backwards to his stews with the fish and bid us take our own time as we thought proper He also shew d us the gate that we should not mistake Q Did he mention your going in the night Hanson He did we went thro Hounslow about a quarter before ten or it might be ten Q Did he know in what manner you were to get the fish Hanson He did he bid us get them where we could on the waste but he told us of one pond in particular that was the earl of Bath s Q What time did you get to Hanworth Hanson Between ten and eleven it was very dark but the people were not all gone to bed we stopt leaving the cart at a distance and had some beer and went to look at the pond there is a farm-house joining to it and we saw a man with some horses in a stable then we went to the cart and when things grew quiet we brought the cart within about thirty or forty yards of the pond then we took the net and carried it to the pond and drew it till we came about the middle where we met with a tree then I pull d off my cloaths and drew the tree out of the pond and then we drew the net to shore Going to take the fish out we perceiv d a light at a little house near so we put the fish into the wicker basket and into the cart There were carp tench and perch we went away with them to Kendal house where the prisoner lives and carried them thro the gate he had shew d us and put them in the stews as he directed some in the basket and the perch in a sack We came there just before two o clock the clock struck two as we were hanging up the nets Q Who did Graham pay for them Hanson He paid me at the rate of 9 d per pound for them all but paid nothing for the store fish which we put into the ponds We saw him about six in the morning he made a sort of a smile when he saw the fish and said you have met with them to night somewhere Q Did you tell him where you had them Hanson No we did not he never ask d us Q Which of you weigh d the fish Hanson I held up the stilliards and Graham look d at the notches they were his own stilliards he separated the killable fish before we weigh d them Q from prisoner Whether I did not ask him whether they had rob d my lord Vere s pond or not after I had read the advertisement Hanson No he never ask d that question till we heard of it ourselves when our hearts misgave us and we ask d him if the nets and things were safe out of the way Q Did you ever tell him you had rob d any other ponds Hanson Yes we did but we did not tell him what particular ponds he knew we went to the ponds for them Q What is your business Hanson I am a poulterer and go about the country to sell poultry Q Do you sell fish Hanson No I do not Q You say you was afraid pray what was you afraid of Hanson I was afraid to go a fishing where he told us Q Did not Rowley tell you he had a brother that

in the morning about four o clock Francis Talbot called Clarke from the street that his wife got up and attempted to throw the sash up but could not because it stuck with the rain but being a very light clear morning she told him she saw Talbot that he did not see him but heard what passed that when his wife was going down to the door Solomon got out of bed and said it is nobody to you that he went down and staid some time that he heard somebody talking to him below that he came up with a light and put his cloaths on and his wife and he went out together with the man that about a quarter before six o clock as the witness was dressing hims elf somebody knocked very hard at the door he went down and let the prisoner in that in about a minute after the prisoner s wife came that he saw the prisoner give her a handfull of rings about forty out of his pocket which appeared to be mourning rings and then took out two cases of a gold watch but no inside that she went up stairs but he stopped by the passage that then Peal called with a box about two feet long and sixteen or eighteen inches wide and took it up into Solomon s room Solomon went with him that the witness went into his workshop and as he came down stairs Solomon s door was open and he saw a parcel of plate lie on the bed and there appeared to be straws of horse dung among it in the box that he told him he did not like the appearance of it that Solomon said he dealt in plate and he should come to no harm that the witness took up a candlestick that there was as a crest upon it of a serpent winding round something and the same crest in the false nozel of the candlestick that there was other plate but he did not examine what the crest was that there was a large cup with two handles which might hold

between six and seven in the evening Talbot came again and they sent for some more liquor and insisted on his wife and himself drinking with them that Talbot said he wanted money and Solomon gave him ten or eleven guineas and said he had no more that Talbot said they all wanted money and thought it was hard to be kept so long out of it they said there was a guinea to the coachman that he had one and must have another the witness looked upon it the money was for this plate and conjectured it was a felony by the appearance that the plate was melted into fourteen or fifteen ingots that Solomon shewed them to him that the next week he asked him to go with him to buy some chairs and he shewed him a bank note of 10 l payable to Mr Ewer and said he had it with the plate and gave 7 l for it that the prisoner told Talbot not to let Coleby come into the house because he had been an evidence and that he told Talbot to keep away as much as he could and said he did not want any of them there after the ingots were melted he shewed the witness the ingots and said there was as much as cost him 130 l that it was worth 4 s an ounce that the witness was afraid to make a discovery because there were always cutlasses in the room that he was never taken up but Sir John sent for him and he made the discovery Susannah Clarke deposed that on the 2d of April between four and five in the morning Talbot

I did not count them but there were I suppose ten or a dozen that was about the number I lost I am sure there was not more than what I lost they were two inch yellow deals called Dram deals I think they are the same deals from the freshness of the deals in the first place I am confident they have not been piled deals that have been piled across each others contract a mark they had the Dram mark on the edge and they were yellow deals which is another particular circumstance and not only yellow deals but of that quality of yellow deals which is very remarkable there are what we term best deals and last deals these appear to me to be last deals Court What is the specified difference between best and last - The best has more of the heart of the wood the last are more discoloured with the sap I knew I had lost some deals from a circumstance that we always make our observations upon when a barge has lain at a wharf two or three days the deals get a different complection the top deals have a very different complection from those that immediately follow them and the morning following the night the deals were taken out there was the appearance of quite a difference in the barge which shewed there must have been deals upon them the day preceding Mr Garrow Were those that were missing taken up from the whole face of the barge or taken from the top - Taken from the whole face What was the value of those deals you found at the prisoner s - I suppose a guinea How much apiece - I value them at eighteen pence each Court Are you the importer - No we buy of an agent there are agents employed to sell to the yard keepers What was the prisoner a carpenter - No he cuts up the wood and these were too good for that the prisoner keeps a coal shed and sells fire wood and keeps a chandler s shop he is an entire stranger to me I never saw him till he appeared at Justice Hyde s To a carpenter at his shop laid into him what would the worth of these deals be - At least a guinea towards two shillings apiece Mr Silvester You are not the importer then of these deals - I am not they are imported from Dram What quantity of deals are imported from Dram you do not know - That is impossible to say without we were to look at the entries at the Custom-house Therefore it is impossible for you to say what quantities come into this kingdom - Yes Most of your deals I believe do come from Norway - Yes They are not all assigned to you - O dear no Upon these deals there was no mark of yours - No only the mark of Dram I cannot tell what quantity of those deals were on the river at that time those that I lost were on board a barge I had the care of them the ship s crew loaded them When did you see the barge with deals upon it first - Several times it lay several days I cannot tell when I first saw it I remember the circumstance of losing the deals Are those the deals that Gardner was convicted of stealing - Yes Mr Silvester Have you them here - No Nor an end of one - No what I saw I left there I did not attempt to remove them Court Did Gardener plead guilty - No Mr Silvester None were produced at Kingston - No There was a confession of Gardner s -

t18300114-28  261 WILLIAM BELCHER was indicted for feloniously receiving on the 29th of November 14 yards of silk value 9l the goods of John Bedward which had lately before to wit on the same day been feloniously stolen by a certain evil-disposed person he well knowing it to have been stolen MR LEE conducted the prosecution THOMAS EVANS I am shopman to Mr John Bedward a man s mercer of Vigo-street - he purchased sixteen yards of silk of Mr Candy which was delivered to him on the 11th of November it cost 13s per yard for ready money - we generally sold it for 16s fourteen yards and a half of it were placed in the window - I saw it last about the 26th or 27th of November I missed it on Monday the 30th of November about eleven o clock in the morning this is part of the silk - it is not of a common description or pattern it is of Lyons manufacture - I swear this is what was placed in the window I have a pattern which I cut off it myself and it matches exactly with the pattern and the place it was cut from the silk had been round a roller and had a selvidge with a mark on it COURT Q How much is now produced A Eight yards and a quarter - part of it has been cut off that taken from the window was fourteen yards and a half Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Were you before the Magistrate A Yes - I did not swear that it corresponded with the quantity which was eight yards and a quarter it was a mistake of Mr Roe s or of mine I do not which I had measured it the day before and there were eight yards and a quarter of it - I went and rectified the mistake within an hour as soon as I got home I heard that the prisoner proved he had had more than fourteen yards of it - I do not think the number of yards was mentioned in the first instance I had seen it on Wednesday and we missed it on Thursday or Friday but decidedly on the Monday when it was wanted for a customer there are four or five shopmen but we keepour books very regularly and if they had sold it it would have been put down - our books are not here COURT Q You can tell what you sold but cannot speak for others A No - this piece was cut off after we had sold a part of it this is a piece that had been in my master s window SOLOMON JOSEPHS I live at No 26 Wincot-street - I attend sales I have known the prisoner several years he came to my house on the 1st of December and brought these eight yards and a quarter of silk which I was to sell for him at the west-end of the town as it was too high a price for his shop - I was to sell it at 8s or 8s 6d a yard I do not know the value of it I went to Michael Jonas with it and we took it to Mr Pool s to sell it - we were both taken the same afternoon COURT Q What is the prisoner A He now keeps a sale shop and sells clothes shoes and boots his shop is in Portland-town - he has been there two or three years he had lived at a pawnbroker s - I have dealt with him for second-hand clothes Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Did Mr Pool take the silk of you A I did not go into the shop I first became acquainted with the prisoner in consequence of his wanting a cloak for a gentleman - I had the means of procuring that cloak I have dealt with him in different ways- he keeps a shop I have seen piece-goods there - Portland-town is not a very fashionable place Pool s house is in Burlington-passage - Jonas left the silk there I have been out on bail COURT Q I thought you were to sell it A Yes but I met Jonas in the morning and had this silk in my hand - I had a piece of tabaret to sell and Jonas took this piece of silk MICHAEL JONAS I am a general dealer - I buy silks and ladies and gentlemen s wardrobes On the 2nd of December I saw Josephs in Cutler-street with this piece of silk I said I had a customer for it and took it to Mr Pool s for sale - he was not at home but I left it there Josephs staid at the door - I was taken into custody I do not know the value of the silk being new - I had never dealt in such a thing before I was not instructed to take 6s - I was to ask 8s for it I thought it was a moderate price - I had not dealt in silks before Cross-examined Q But you had dealt in second-hand silks A Yes - I could not venture to swear to this silk there may be more like it - it has no mark on it I took a piece of this pattern and there was eight yards and a quarter of it - I believe this is it JAMES POOL I am a mercer and live at No 4 Old Burlington-street Jonas came on the 2nd of December and left this silk at my shop for sale at 8s a yard I told my son to look to the invoices as I was sure it was below the mark - these silks have not been in the market more than six weeks I gave the witness into custody - it is Lyons silk I had paid 17s a yard to the same man for some similar to this - the pattern I think you cannot match Cross-examined Q But you bought it of a person who sells it A Yes - not of the manufacturer it had not been in the market more than six weeks before this happened - from my knowledge of the business I know it has not I know it is Lyons silk and of a new pattern - I have bought second-hand silk of Jonas but I never saw him with any thing new before I have sold him second-hand clothes JOHN BEDWARD I received information and went to Mr Pool s - I saw Jonas there the other witness was brought in I believe this is my property - it is a scarce article and foreign silk it has not been manufactured in Spitalfields Cross-examined Q Do you know all the Spitalfields weavers A No I know many of them - I do not know that it has not been imitated the person I bought it of is in Court - he is the importer it had been in my stock in the shop - I have several shopmen I had seen it about three days before there was an alarm that it was missed - my shopmen are not here but I have made every inquiry among them I believe it had not been sold COURT Q Whether this silk could or could not be imitated what you bought was of Lyons manufacture and this is of Lyons manufacture A Yes it is different to British manufacture and in width I should have sold it at 16s or 17s a yard - I do not think if I were to order it in Spitalfields and give them a month to make it in that they would be able to make it to match as this pattern does I believe the pattern and piece to be the same - the ground flowers and every thing seem to me to coincide exactly in trying to imitate it exactly in Spitalfields they would fail to do it nineteen times out of twenty - indeed if I was to write abroad to the manufacturer and say Make one like this I think neither the ground nor the flower would correspond exactly as this piece does - GRAHAM I live with Mr Charles Candy - he is abroad this piece of silk is foreign manufacture - we only imported one of this pattern I firmly believe this is part of it - I would not swear it I think we could have a piece like this made at Lyons but decidedly not in this country - they may have another piece by them at Lyons Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q You think it possible there may be another piece A Yes but very improbable I do not know how many pieces they might make two pieces might be so manufactured that a person could not distinguish one from the other but not to correspond as this pattern does - we imported but one piece and sold that to the prosecutor BENJAMIN SCHOFIELD I am an officer In consequence of information I took the prisoner on Wednesday the 7th of December in High-street Portland-town this piece of silk was produced at the time - he said he knew the silk he was very much flurried and I told him to be cautions as it was stolen - he said he bought it at an auction-room about a fortnight or three weeks before but he did not know where I said that was before it was stolen - he then said Let me consider it was about Friday or Saturday last and concluded by saying It was on Friday he afterwards said he bought it in a street in Petticoat-lane and afterwards that it was in a house in Petticoat-lane and he could produce the man he bought it of I then gave him in charge of Avis - this is the silk I have had it ever since - I likewise produce a yard and a quarter more which I got from Mr Burnett who said he got it of the prisoner Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q What time didyou go to the prisoner s A About seven o clock in the evening I saw his wife but did not make myself known - I gave her a fictitious name there is a shop window but very few goods in it - the prisoner came home about ten o clock and I asked if he knew this silk he said directly that he knew it and named the quantity but he was flurried I told him before he made this statement that it was stolen and he looked in that kind of way as I should have expected a person would who was guilty - here is a yard and a half in this other piece of silk according to my measurement GEORGE AVIS I am an officer I was with Schofield outside the door with Josephs I took the prisoner to the watch-house - I made him no promise or threat but he told me that he bought the silk in Petticoat-lane and gave it to Josephs to sell knowing him to be a better judge of silk than himself Prisoner s Defence I went to Josephs as I had an order for a gentleman s cloak and I knew he was acquained with master tailors at the west-end of the town - he got me four cloaks and I sold one then there were tassels wanting and Josephs told me if I would call in the course of a week he would get them - I called and I happened to have this silk with me he said if I had not a customer for it he thought he could get me one - I had sold some of the silk as I can prove I told Josephs it cost me 8s per yard and if he could get any thing more as a profit well and good - I left it with him on commission JOHN BURNETT I am a master tailor and live in Upper North-place Gray s Inn-road I bought three yards and a quarter of this silk of the prisoner the latter end of November about the last day it was sealed up in this paper at Marlborough-street office where I attended with it and has my signature upon it MR LEE Q You are a very good judge of these articles A I have made up a great many - I was to give 8s or 8s 6d a yard for this - there is an account between us I supposed 8s about the value of it I have been a tailor all my life - I have worked for the prisoner and if he has any thing to suit me he says Will that do for you I saw this silk and said What do you want for it he said 8s 6d - I said I will give you 8s I have known him ten years he is a general salesman and deals in coats hats shoes silks and other things - he has been about three years in this business he was before that foreman at a pawnbroker s - I have dealt with him for silks before I should think that this is an old pattern -I believe I can get some of it within three hundred yards of here for that price at a public shop MR BARRY Q Had you sold things to the prisoner A Yes he asked 8s 6d per yard for it - I said I thought 8s enough for it to throw it into the window COURT Q What was the price to be A I said I will give you 8s - he said When we settle we will see about it I did not think it cheap at 8s 6d - I thought it enough for it he was foreman to Mr Price a pawnbroker in Wentworth-street - I had worked for him at that time but had no dealings with him I had not heard that Mr Price had been in difficulties - I have been to the house two or three times I believe within these last twelve months he has been a bankrupt THOMAS KEENE I am a linen-draper and live at Brunswick-parade White Conduit-fields I bought a yard of silk of the prisoner on a Tuesday or Wednesday the latter end of November I had it made into a waistcoat and this is it - I think it was about the 24th or 25th of November MR LEE Q Are you a master linen-draper A Yes in a small way purchasing silks is not in the way of my business except for my own wear - I gave 8s for this yard and thought it a fair price I have sold silks in my shop but am not acquainted with this sort of article COURT Q Did you know him living with Mr Price A Yes - he served his time to him and I think lived there for twenty years I never knew Price was in trouble MR LEE Q How long have you been a linen-draper A I served my time to it and have been five years with a linen-draper of Bishopsgate-street - twelve months ago I was warehouseman at a house JOHN FORD I am a baker and live in Portland-town I bought three quarters of a yard of silk of the prisoner which I had made into this waistcoat it was on the Monday previous to his going away MR LEE Q Was it the latter end of November A I do not know it was the Monday before he was taken - I gave 3s 9d for it Prisoner He did not buy it at all Witness My wife did - she said she paid 3s 9d for it here is her handwriting to say what she paid WILLIAM BOOKER I am an assistant to a linen-draper in Tooley-street I called on the prisoner one Sunday the latter end of November I saw some silk there and purchased a yard and a half for two waistcoats - one for myself and one for my young master these are the waistcoats MR LEE Q It was the latter end of November A I think about the 27th I paid 7s a yard - I am not a judge of the value but I should think that a fair price WILLIAM HENRY BYRON I am a tailor of Union-street Whitechapel I know the prisoner I bought three yards and three quarters of this silk of him about the 22nd or 23rd of November - I have made up two waistcoats of it and this is the remainder I was going to make it up but I found the prisoner had got into trouble MR LEE I presume being a tailor you are a judge of these things A I think myself a little judge - I gave 10s a yard I thought it was not dear GUILTY Aged 33 - Transported for Fourteen Years

he said five sovereigns and that he had never seen the person before I asked where he had been every day from the time he left Leicester till he arrived in London - he could not tell where he had been on any one day nor any one house he had put up at he said he came to London as a hawker to buy goods and remained till after the King s funeral - after he was in custody I desired him to be taken to Mr B Lewis Wych-street I asked where he was the day previous to his coming to London - he said on that day he was at Coventry I asked where there - he said he could not tell he did not know the house I asked him if he could point out the house of Lewis in Wych-street - he said in the shop that he could point it out and when we got to St Clement s church I requested Led better to stop and let him point it out we both asked him to point out the house - he said he could not he said other persons were in the room at the time he received the note at Pershore he was asked the names of the persons - he said they were all strangers Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did you go into Wych-street with him A I did and found a person named Lewis kept the house I asked in his presence if he knew him - he had not referred me there but I understood he had desired the parcel to be sent there I desired him when we got to St Clement s church to point out the house - it could be seen from there it was not thirty yards off for it is at the end of the street three or four houses up - I cannot say when this note was issued MR PHILLIPS Q What passed between Lewis and you in the prisoner s presence A I asked Lewis if he knew the prisoner - he said he did not he had never seen him before the prisoner made no answer to that - I asked if he had breakfasted there he said he had not - Mrs Lewis came afterwards and said he had been at the house that morning but neither eat nor drank there I delivered the note to the chief cashier and am certain this is the same note SAMUEL HEDLEY I am a clerk to Lambton and Co bankers of Newcastle-on-Tyne On the 3rd of July I gave Mr Dickenson some Bank notes which I entered in this book - this note is one of them it corresponds with the entry and I have no doubt is one of those I paid him Cross-examined Q Is that book kept by yourself A Partly - this entry was made by me at the time Dickenson is a clerk in our bank - I sent the notes by him to Mr Jamieson - No 1 158 dated 7th April 1829 50l was one of them UTRICK WALTON DICKENSON I am clerk at Lambton s bank On the 3rd of July I received 800l from Hedley and gave the same notes to Mr Jamieson s clerk Mr Young in about five minutes JAMES YOUNG I am an assistant to the prosecutors at Newcastle-on-Tyne I received the 800l from Dickenson in notes and took them immediately to Mr Jamieson THOMAS JAMIESON I am a warehouseman and live at Newcastle-on-Tyne I received 800l from Young between four and five o clock in the afternoon on the 3rd of July I do not know the numbers of the notes - I put the same notes into my breeches pocket they were never out of my pocket till I missed them on the 5th of July- I had seen them between the 3rd and 5th they were in my possession on the 4th of July when I was travelling I got to Manchester about twelve on the 5th and was going into the Albion hotel - there was a crowd assembled to see the King proclaimed I heard several people crying Make way Make way I looked round and saw three respectable people like merchants clerks following me and when I got to the bottom of the steps there was a crowd of women who would not let me pass up the stairs - an altercation took place I felt a pressure and an attempt to take my watch - I turned round to ask what that meant and they were gone I got through the crowd into the hotel and in a few minutes missed the whole 800l I wrote to the Bank to have the notes stopped that night and some time after in consequence of a communication from the Bank I came to town and this case was investigated Cross-examined Q You do not identify this particular note A No - I placed the notes into my pocket on the 3rd they remained there till the 5th and were never out of my possession - I took them out of my pocket in the coach to look at them on the 4th on the road from Newcastle to Leeds and put a 30l promissory note which I had in the same parcel I wrapped it round the 800l they were just rolled together - I swear none of them fell from the bundle it was impossible when at Manchester I felt a catch at my watch and I was prossed round the body - I had some sovereigns in the same breeches pocket but had no occasion to take them out as I had money in my other pocket and paid my fare out of that I am certain I took nothing from the pocket the notes were in - I slept at Leeds on the 4th and left my notes in my pocket I felt them there - it is impossible one could be lost MR PHILLIPS Q About what hour on the 3rd did you receive them A Between four and five o clock at Newcastle - I arrived at Manchester about twelve on the 5th and felt this pressure between one and two I have no recollection of the prisoner being one who surrounded me MR CHRISTMAS Newcastle is about two hundred miles from Pershorne GEORGE LEDBETTER I am an officer I took the prisoner into custody HENRY LAVENDER This is the note he gave me -

I returned at ten and it was gone I had left Charles Wells in the house - he was convicted last Session of the robbery after his conviction he gave me information and I went to the prisoner s house in Field-lane I saw him and said Are you a pieman he said Yes I said Are you the man who bought a gold watch and two gold seals he said No I am a poor man how could I buy such property I have not 3s in my pocket - I said If you are the man to avoid the trouble of prosecution I would rather give you the money which you gave for the watch he said he knew nothing of it I went home and in about two days I saw him again in Holborn - Richard Wells my servant s brother was with me and in consequence of what he said I said to the prisoner Will you tell me were the watch is or I ll call an officer he said he knew nothing of it - I again said if he did not tell me I would have him taken up - he said Well come home with me and I will speak with you I did not go with him for there was a row in the street - the people began to push me about I called an officer and gave him in charge - I have never seen the watch in his possession Cross-examined by MR LEE Q I believe he was takenbefore Alderman Scholey A He was taken before an Alderman he was bailed - I do not know that he was discharged he came forward voluntarily a fortnight afterwards when he was told - he was only out of custody once- the Magistrate offered to bail him WILLIAM EDMEAD I shall be fourteen years old at Christmas I knew Charles Wells who was convicted here when in Mr Toth s service I saw him on Monday morning the 7th of June between nine and ten o clock he came to my mother s in St John s-square-passage about five minutes walk from Toth s - he asked me to sell a gold watch for him I saw it - it had two seals a key a guard a ring and a green ribbon to it he carried them in his own pocket - he showed them to me when he came into Benjamin-street I went with him to Field-lane and saw the prisoner at his lodgings there - I knew him before he got his living by buying stolen property but sold pies up and down Holborn - I took Wells there and asked the prisoner to buy a gold watch he asked us to let him see it - Wells showed it to him he said he did not think it was gold but he would go and see if it was - he took the watch with him I followed him to the shop of Mr Reeves a pawnbroker - he was asked 3l for it before he took it there Wells had said he would ask 2l - I said Don t ask 2l ask 3l I believed it was gold from what Wells said - I saw the prisoner go into Reeves Wells was with me - neither of us went in he came out and met us at the top of old Fleet-market gave us 1s and asked if we were not going to stand something to drink I never saw the watch after it went into his hands - we went to the first public-house on the righthand side of old Fleet-market from Holborn and had a quartern of liquor and a 2d cake which came to 6d - Wells paid for it out of the shilling the prisoner then went away - Wells and I called in about two hours he was at home and gave Wells 8s 6d - we asked if he could not give us some more he said nothing to that and we came away - we both called again in the evening and he gave 30s into Wells hand I called alone two days after and told him that Charles Wells was caught - he said Never mind he is sure to get off I asked if he could not give me something to take to Wells and he gave me 7s 6d - we went up to where his stall stood and I tossed him for pies I won twelve pies for 8d and then I stood a pint of ale in Fetter-lane - that took 1s out of the 7s 6d I bought some more things and took them to Wells - I did not see the prisoner again Q When did you first tell any body of this was it before or after Wells was tried A After Wells told of the prisoner and I told Sir Peter Laurie at Guildhall - it was about eleven weeks after he bought the watch I had been taken up then Cross-examined Q Wells was an acquaintance of yours A Yes - I had known him about three years I have made no agreement with Wells mother about what I was to say here - I have seen her several times since I have been in custody but had no conversation about what I was to say - I told Sir Peter Laurie the same the whole of it I took Wells in about 6s worth of things - I kept 1s 6d of the money I did not steal it - I have come from my mother s to-day I was in the House of Correction for a month I was never there before nor in this Court - I was in custody twice I was eight weeks at Clerkenwell - I have not been in any other place nor in custody more than twice except when I was taken up about Wells but was not in prison I was never taken into custody for picking pockets - I am to have nothing if the prisoner is convicted I do not expect to be tried myself if he is not convicted - Wells told of me being one of the party who disposed of the watch I was in the House of Correction at that time - it was about a fortnight after Wells was convicted Wells said the prisoner was the person and I said so too I did not give information about it till I was accused - I do not know whether the prisoner had the watch in his hand when he went to Reeves I did not see him take it out of the house nor did I see him with it at the pawnbroker s - I did not hear Sir Peter Laurie say he would not believe a word I said he offered to bail the prisoner - I went to the prisoner s house about a quarter of an hour after Wells came to me Wells stopped and looked at it in Benjamin-street and I saw what was attached to it - one seal was a white stone and the other a red one I told the Magistrate so I do not recollect the colour of the guard WILLIAM IVEY I am shopman to Mr Reeve On the 7th of June the prisoner came to our shop alone - I think it was between two and three o clock in the afternoon he came with a gold seal and gold ring and asked 15s on them which I lent him - he pawned them in the name of John Britton Field lane I have known him six years - on the 8th of June James Lock came to look at the seal he paid the interest on it - I gave him a fresh duplicate he produced the first one to me - I never saw the prisoner afterwards on the 11th of June Lock pawned another seal for 12s and redeemed them both the same day Cross-examined Q For what was the interest paid A One day - I am sure of that Reeves has another shopman - I cannot state what kind of seals they were JAMES LOCK I am a waiter at Mr Low s wine-vaults Holborn-hill I have known the prisoner about three years - he offered to sell me the duplicate of a seal and ring for 3s in pledge at Reeves I bought it and took the duplicate to Reeves they were shown to me by Ivey- I paid 4d interest and had a duplicate in my own name a few days after the prisoner brought me another gold seal - I gave him 18s for it and pawned it at Reeves for 12s I redeemed them the same day and delivered them back to the prisoner - he gave me the same for them as I had paid him he lived in Field-lane - I have not seen them since I cannot recollect what sort of seals they were - I asked how he came by them he said he had found them but did not say where - I saw him several times afterwards but had no conversation about them after he had been taken I asked him if there was any fear of my being taken as I had bought the seals of him - he said No I had no occasion to come forward to say any thing for he should appear when his time was up and he had no doubt he should get through it Cross-examined Q You cannot state on what day you received them from him A No whether it was June or July exactly I once pawned my watch atReeves before but nothing else that had common seals to it not worth 6d each Q The prisoner said he should get through it - did he not also say he was innocent A He did COURT Q Did he tell you what charge had been made against him A Yes buying a gold watch and seals RICHARD WELLS I am a journeyman dyer and live at No 131 St John-street I only know the prisoner by going to him about the watch which my brother had stolen I went to him when my brother was in Newgate for stealing the watch after he had been tried -

the prosecutor was with me he was told he had received a watch and appendages - he denied it he was liberated on his own recognizances - he appeared according to promise and at the last hearing Sir Peter Laurie desired me to see if I could find any of the property I went to the pawnbroker s and found these seals had been pawned Cross-examined Q What time in August did you take him A I think it was on the 3rd I believe he was allowed a day or two to see if he could find bail MR LEE to GEORGE TOTH Q I believe you offered this man 6l to find the watch and said you would take no proceedings A No I offered him 3l - he said he knew nothing about it GUILTY Aged 33 - Transported for Fourteen Years

I went through the crowd on my way to the Albion hotel I heard several persons cry Make way make way I looked round and saw three gentlemen following me whom I took for clerks in some warehouse in attempting to go up the steps of the hotel there was a large assembly chiefly women who opposed my passage and after some confusion I felt a pressure on my body and an attempt to take my watch but it was not taken - I got into the hotel and found after some time on putting my hand into my pocket that my notes were gone- I had had 800l in Bank notes in my pocket and a 30l promissory note the largest was a 500l Bank note - I had felt the notes safe when I got to Manchester about twelve o clock in the day I had received the 500l note in my own parlour at Newcastle from Mr Young on the 3rd of July - I afterwards saw the two prisoners and another person named Weston before the Magistrate in London Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You thought a snatch had been made at your watch A Yes - the persons were about me but at my watch particularly I was congratulating myself that they had not taken it I never suspected I had lost any thing else - I had had the notes two days in my possession they were wrapped up and were in my left-hand breeches pocket not in any case - I had thirty or forty sovereigns in the same pocket and they were not taken I slept at home on the first night after I received the notes and on going to bed I left them in my trousers which laid in my bed-room with all the money in them - I examined them the next morning in the coach as I was going to Leeds they were all right then and I put the 30l note with them - I counted them and noticed the sum I think you did not ask me last night whether I had counted or examined the notes - see page 678 Q Did you not tell me that you did not count or examine them but put the note or bill round them A I do not recollect hearing the question or giving the answer - I believe I said I did not take the notes from my pocket from the 3rd to the 5th when you first asked me the question but on the second answer I said I did take them out I considered the question to mean whether the notes were out of my possession - I did look at the notes and examine them there was no person that morning in the coach but myself so that they could not have been taken from my pocket in the coach - I do not recollect seeing them when I got out of the coach but I felt them in my pocket COURT Q Did you sleep at Leeds A Yes - no one slept in the same room I found the notes were there in the morning and at Manchester I felt them in my pocket but did not take them out WILLIAM BROADBELT I keep the Two Bells in Whitechapel-road A man named Schooling came to my house on the 17th of July between three and four o clock in the afternoon - in consequence of what he said I afterwards saw Weston and between eight and nine o clock in the evening I saw the two prisoners and Weston with them in a room up stairs in my house a 500l note was offered to me in the prisoners presence - I saw something in Weston s hand I went down and fetched a bottle of wine and when I came up again the note laid on the table for me to look at I do not know who laid it there - I said it did not look very nice it being in two halves Weston said If you will call for some paper and paste I will paste it togethere - I said it did not signify I put on my spectacles looked at it and put the two halves together in my left hand - I then rang the bell and called my wife to come in I told her I wanted the cash-box - she brought it me the men asked what notes I had got and said they hoped I had not any big notes - I said I had four 20l notes about one hundred and forty sovereigns and some 5l notes and they must take 10l in silver or give me credit I was to pay 350l for the note - I had some officers in a back room who then came in the prisoners all rose up and were alarmed - I cried out Mistress take the cash-box down stairs and I cried out Come up all of you I have got thirty men below the officers then handcuffed the men and told me to put a signature on the note which was then in my left hand - I laid it on the table the officer called for a pen and ink - the prisoners then made a scramble at the note and got the half of it and I got the other Smith said D-n my eyes no man shall put a signature on that note - they were at that time handcuffed I do not recollect that I said any thing to them but I looked at them and they were all gulping together - Schooling and some others came into the room but they did not say any thing the prisoners were then taken away Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q And you would give us to understand that a note of this kind was brought to you for improper purposes A Yes - the officers were not in the room when the note was given to me but they were behind Weston came first between five and six o clock but I did not see the prisoners till between eight and nine - Weston went out and brought them in I do not know whether he saw them go by or not -

I told the officers there was something trying on to pass a bad note or a forged note MR PHILLIPS Q Had you known a word about this hand-bill at that time A No - the prisoners were there when I was asked not to give large notes in exchange and when I enumerated the notes silver and gold - I did not know whether the note was stolen or forged or why it was offered to me I told the officer - Norris and Shields were sent for afterwards COURT Q At the time the three men were with you was the name of Schooling mentioned A No - he first came and said he knew a man who had a note to sell and then the other came Smith Q Did not you say at Lambeth-street that it was Smith snatched the note and ate it A I said I thought so but I would not swear it - I did go and touch you MR PHILLIPS Q Were the whole three affecting to swallow at the same time A Yes JURY Q Which of the three was it who said he hoped you had no large notes A Weston JOHN NORRIS I am an officer of Lambeth-street Broadbelt made a communication to me on Saturday the 17th of July and I went to his house about eight o clock in the evening I was put into a room on the first floor -

there was a bottle of wine and some glasses on the table Broadbelt said I have the note and Weston is the person who gave it me - I said What note and he said A 500l note I sent my companion for an officer - Shields came to me we handcuffed the prisoners together - Schooling and some other persons came up I put the prisoners up in a corner of the room and told Broadbelt to put his initials on the note that I might see what it was - he sat down at the table and pulled out a note from his pocket first one half and then the other he put them on the table and there was a sudden rush made on me by the prisoners - they all appeared to rush on me and before I could recover myself they were all at a distance from me I looked at their mouths and they all appeared to be gulping - I will swear the two prisoners appeared so one half of the note was missing from the table - it could never be found Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q Then you never saw it at all A No they appeared to me to be halfnotes - I had not time to look at them I have smacked my lips after a glass of wine MR PHILLIPS Q Did they appear as if swallowing A Yes they had drank some wine before I got there - I did not hear any thing said about the signature on the note JAMES SHIELD I am an officer I went to the house on the 17th of July and up to the first floor the two prisoners and several persons were there -

when the papers were put on the table the four men were placed at the further end of the room Smith and Schooling complained that their handcuffs were too tight - I examined them and found they were I took out the key to loosen them and they made a rush - I saw three of them scrambling over the table their hands were off the table and up to their mouths - they appeared to be chewing something they afterwards complained of being thirsty and a pot of half-and-half was given them Norris took a letter from Price Smith Q Did you say that I this man and another were reaching over the table was I not handcuffed at the time to Schooling A I did not see him but I saw you Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q Were they not so handcuffed that they could not reach over the table A Only one of their hands was fastened WILLIAM BROADBELT I gave the half note to the Magistrate and he gave it to Norris JOHN NORRIS This is the half note UTRICK WALTON DICKINSON I am a clerk to Lambton and Co bankers Newcastle-on-Tyne I got a 500l note from Mr Hedley and gave it to Mr Young -

he said to me that a person whom he had known some time had offered just at the dock gate to assist him and they both came together to Great St Helens with the truck Cooper there asked me if I would allow Smith the person who was with him to take the luggage to my residence at Islington - he said he knew him to be an honest man and he would go part of the way with him I allowed him so to do - I then went with my family to Islington and reached there about half-past six or seven o clock I waited till nine and as the luggage did not arrive I sent my servant to town to inquire if it was coming - I went to town myself about half-past ten o clock but could get no account of my property I went in the morning to Lambeth-street office and gave information and three or four days afterwards Lee produced some articles Cross-examined by MR CHURCHILL Q You entrusted them to Cooper A Yes and he recommended Smith at Great St Helens - I did not say at the office that Smith met me at the wharf I did not see him till he was at St Helens - he went with Cooper I gave my consent that he should take the goods - Cooper said he was an honest man and he would take them safely I suppose he had to go two miles and a half - they were in a common truck not more than my own porter could conveniently take care of Cooper said he himself wished to go away -I saw them in St Helens and Cooper and Smith were there together a few articles and some wrappers were found where Smith lived - I have seen Jane Smith several times at Lambeth-street and once or twice at the prison where I went to ascertain where the property was she had a shift which was among this property on her back - she went up stairs with the matron and my wife and they found it on her I was before the Grand Jury when she was examined - I did not say I would have her transported if she did not tell the facts I said most likely she would be transported if she did not state the facts MRS MARY ANN COHEN I returned with my husband and two daughters to St Katherine s-docks in the Margate steam-boat on the 24th of August we had nine packages containing the articles stated three Church of England Prayer-books some Bibles and other things -

I took the nine packages into a truck this was about half-past four or a quarter before five o clock - I saw Smith just at the time the steam-boat came up and he shoved behind the truck in going to St Helen s -I then found it was so late that I was obliged to go elsewhere Smith there took charge of the truck from my recommendation - all the things were then in it and he was to take it to No 3 Suffolk-place Lower-road Islington I did not know where Smith lived - I went with him to Liverpool-street and there left him I had a pint of beer before I left him Cross-examined Q What made you recommend him A I always took him to be an honest hard-working chap - I dare say I had known him twelve months or longer I had not seen him before that perhaps for two or three months - I did not know what was in these packages there were two hampers two portmanteaus two large boxes and a bag - there were nine in all I cannot exactly give you the description of the others - there was a white cloth over them before I saw them there was one cloth over each of two packages - I left Smith about the middle of Liverpool-street JANE SMITH I am the wife of William Smith I know the prisoner Lyall and I saw the other two in the van with me when I was taken to prison Lyall came into my place on a Tuesday - I do not know what day of the month it was I went before the Magistrate on the Saturday - I was lodging in Flower and Dean-street - there were some boxes and other things which my husband brought in they were there all night and went away early in the morning -

I saw him there a good many times he asked me a good many questions - he asked if I knew Lyall I said I did not - he said he would give me fourteen years if I did not tell him all about it he did not threaten me with any thing else - he did not touch me at all I told him at first I did not know Lyall but after he spoke to me I told him I did - I said before the Magistrate that Mr Cohen had threatened me and I was frightened I did refuse to swear to what I had said in consequence of Mr Cohen s threats - I said nothing against the other two and did not know the name of Lyall till it was suggested to me COURT Q Did you know what was brought to the place A Gowns and linen I put some of the linen on- it was claimed by Mrs Cohen I told the Magistrate I was frightened - the things were at my husband s on the Tuesday before I was taken ELIZABETH JOHNSON I am the wife of Andrew Johnson - we live in Flower and Dean-street opposite the house in which Smith lodged On a Tuesday evening I saw Smith bringing a load in a truck - I do not know the day of the month he stopped at his own door took out a very handsome small box a carpet bag and a white deal box he looked over saw me looking at him and let down the end of the truck on the curb I was standing with my baby in my arms - he then took out the other things which seemed to be boxes but I could not well see what they were on the following morning between six and seven o clock I saw a cart come to take away the things - there were two men and a woman besides the carter I cannot tell who either of them were except Sheen he was the carter but I did not see him take any thing from the house - he was in the cart guiding the horse I did not notice any name on the cart it went away and returned not long after - I cannot tell the time - it took some things away then there did not seem to be much - it might have taken them all at once Cross-examined Q Was the cart larger than the truck A Yes it would have held twice as much as the truck did I cannot tell whether there was any necessity for it to return COURT Q Is the man who brought the truck the husband of Mrs Smith A I believe them to be man and wife I never knew any thing dishonest of him before - I went before the Magistrate a few days after I saw them SAMUEL DENSTON I am a journeyman carpenter I was at the new church at the corner of Angel-passage Skinner-street I cannot positively say that I saw any of the prisoners but I saw a cart the carman two men and a woman were with it the name of Sheen was on the cart and I think William but I know it was Sheen - the carman was in the cart and handed the goods to the others -I first saw a large bag put on a man s back and then a woman took something covered which I thought was a looking-glass Cross-examined Q You speak rather in doubt about the name on the cart A I am positive to the name ofSheen but whether it was William or not I will not say - I think it was on a Wednesday COURT Q Were you before the Magistrate A Yes - I think it must have been a fortnight afterwards MR ADOLPHUS Q What time in the morning was it A Just as we were going to breakfast a little before eight CATHERINE BUTLER I live at No 9 Angel-passage Skinner-street -

the goods were taken away again the same day Cross-examined Q Where were you A In my own room - the bottom room I was coming out of my door and saw them - they went to the top-room I did not take much notice -

the cart came back again with Sheen and took in some sacks which Lyall and a woman brought out Sheen did not get out of the cart COURT Q What did Lyall do A He put something into the cart tied up in sacks they appeared to have things in them and were very heavy Cross-examined Q How many sacks A Two heavy sacks what was in them I do not know JAMES LEE I am an officer of Lambeth-street In consequence of information on the 28th of August I went to No 14 Cheshire-street Waterloo-town I found Mrs Smith there and under the bed I found a quantity of handkerchiefs stockings napkins and other articles of wearing apparel there were eight muslin handkerchiefs five pieces of muslin four stockings a shift and a number of other things - I found a knife and a clothes-brush that was all I found then - I took the woman to Lambeth-street and found on her two keys I then went to No 1 or 2 in Flower and Dean-street - I there found the pieces of a deal box and the embers of what appeared to have been a hamper burned in the fire my brother officer found a handkerchief with Mr Cohen s initials on it - I did not see any man at either place on the 11th of September I went to Wentworth-street Whitechapel and took Sheen where he lived with his father - I inquired if he had taken any goods of any description from a house in Flower and Dean-street on the 25th of August he said he had - I asked how often he went he said once with a cart and he took them into Bishopsgate-street as far as the halfpenny toll - he there met two men with a horse and cart that the men told him they were tired of waiting and they thought he was not coming he said their cart came from Westminster and had oysters in it - he said he put the things into that cart and he was to have 1s 6d for the job he also stated that it was at half-past seven in the morning when he moved those things - he did not say from whom he was to have the 1s 6d on the 16th of September I went to Stewart s house in Angel-alley Bishopsgate-street in company with Shelswell and another person - I found Stewart and told him I apprehended him on a charge of receiving goods knowing them to be stolen he said very well he would go - I searched the room and there were four square pieces of deal which appeared to have been a deal box - he and his wife were in bed Shelswell took from under the bed a piece of a deal box with some chalk writing on it it got rubbed out but I can nearly recollect what was written on it - there were four or five silk gowns twenty-five other gowns eighteen towels stockings handkerchiefs caps and a variety of articles and 16s 1l 14s and other sums put at the end of each lot as if they had been sold for that - I found in the box two skeleton-keys a picklock-key a crow-bar on a further search when I was there there was a hole in the ceiling and Shelswell and another person got through the hole and brought down a great quantity of house breaking implements such as jemmies crow-bars &c I took them and then went and took Lyall in Castle-street Whitechapel very near where Sheen lives - I searched his promises and saw a bottle of oil but I did not take it at that time I described it to Mr Cohen who desired me to bring it away - this is it I told Lyall what I took him for Cross-examined Q Then Mr Cohen did not describe the bottle till you had told him of it A No this is the board that had the writing on it - I do not know how it got rubbed off I did not take a copy of what was on it - I will swear it was not in pencil - I mentioned at the Police-office what Sheen said about the cart and the oysters THOMAS SHELSWELL I am an officer I assisted Lee in searching for these things we took Sheen at his father s house and Stewart in Angel-alley - I found this board under the bed it had gowns shifts petticoats and other things marked on it with figures carried out- it was in chalk and here is the word shifts nearly remaining now - this bottle of oil was found at Lyall s I found these other things at Smith s and two wrappers with a square mark on them as if a box had been tied up here is one wrapper marked K No 2 -

he appeared to sell waddings and skins for muffs but the whole was in a very confused state when I went in the first time the skins were on the left-hand side and he produced them openly to me they were drab which is a common colour in the trade - my brother s name was not on the skins a stranger might have bought them innocently HENRY FOWNES I went with the officer and found the skins - I picked out nine which I know to be our property and was a part of those stolen from us on the 2nd of October -

they are our own men they do not dye for other persons - some of them are here I will not swear they do not dye for other persons - these skins are finished and were so when we found them we have sold finished black skins and dealt very extensively in them but not in this state -

t18310217-207  633 CHARLES HAYNES was indicted for feloniously receiving on the 16th of January 2 horses price 20l and 1 mare price 10l the property of William Elson well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute & c MR CLARKSON conducted the prosecution WILLIAM ELSON I live at Bramshot near Liphook in Hampshire On the 14th of January I had three pony horses and a mare - one of the horses was brown another a dark brown and the third a black stallion the mare was brown - on that day they had been employed in carrying stones on the road and I put them up about four o clock at night I saw them safe in the stable between seven and eight - I got up in the morning between five and six found the stable door broken thrown open and the mare the black horse and one of the brown ones were gone as soon as it got day-light I looked about and tracked two men on a dung-hill and off again I also tracked the feet of three borses behind a cart up the hill where they had turned off towards the common and a cart appeared to have been tied to a hedge - the horses appeared to have been tied behind the cart and to have hung back when they first started - I followed the track on for ten miles in the London road towards Godalming I afterwards came to London where I saw Pople and Curtis - I missed the horses on a Saturday morning and came to London on the Thursday following I went to Union-ball and saw the officers - they produced the two horses and the mare which I had lost all three together I am quite sure they are my horses and were what I had seen safe in my stable SARAH KITCHING I am the wife of Thomas Kitching - he is a publican and keeps the Bee Hive public-house at Hayes or Yeading - I know the prisoner he had slept in our house On the morning of Saturday the 15th of January I went to the door about eleven or between eleven and twelve o clock and saw the prisoner standing at our stable door - he had a black pony with a long tail with him at the same time I saw a person go by in a cart - it was in consequence of what I saw that person do that I looked to the stable door and saw the prisoner - when the prisoner had put the pony into the stable he came into my house with the saddle on his arm - he had something to drink I believe a small glass of brandy he then went away but came again in the course of the day slept there that night and came down stairs the next morning while we were at breakfast I had noticed the man with the cart had another horse tied at the side - my son came home late on that Saturday night I saw the same pony which I had seen at the stable door in the possession of the officer in London - I have not the least doubt of its being the same I know a cottage near the Bee Hive in which Moffatt who I had seen in the cart and a man named Holding live - they were acquainted with the prisoner I had seen them altogether often - the prisoner Moffat Holding and two other friends had supped together at our house on that Saturday night Cross-examined Q Did you say at the last trial that you had seen these men often together A I will not swear that I did - it was in the middle of the day that I saw him with the pony by our stable door our house stands a little way back from the public road but it joins it - he could not have got to the stable without going along the public road I think I had known him three months before I do not know whether he is in the habit of buying and selling horses - I think I had seen him with a horse once before but he generally came to Moffat s and walked from there to our house - we do not keep an ostler the prisoner gave me no charge to keep it secret - the pony was put into the stable to which travellers or strangers might have access THOMAS KITCHING JUN I am the son of Mrs Kitching I came home on Saturday night the 15th of January between six and seven o clock - I remember seeing the prisoner next morning up against our door he had a black pony with a long tail he called out to me Who is the boy for a ride I said Yes if you like - he helped me on the pony and told me to take him down to my father s orchard which I did and the prisoner followed me I took the halter off the pony turned him loose and the prisoner told me to drive him up amongst my father s horses which I did - I saw that pony afterwards in the stable by Union-hall I am sure it was the same pony - I think it was the week afterwards Cross-examined Q Were there any white spots about this black pony A I did not take notice of that in particular - I did not observe whether there was a large white spot on one of his sides nor whether the left ear was cropped or whether he had two white fore-legs but I know the horse I saw afterwards was the one I rode I did not notice whether he had a white spot on his forehead but I am sure the horse I saw was the same I rode- it was about fifteen miles from our house to where I saw him again in town I should have known him any where but not by any particular mark he was not a very remarkable horse - I did not say at Union-hall I would not swear to the horse not to my recollection I cannot swear I did not - I had seen the prisoner about twice before that day I knew his name was Charles he had been at my father s on the Saturday night and the Sunday night THOMAS KITCHING SEN I keep the Bee Hive at Hayes On Saturday morning the 15th of January I went to my stable between seven and eight o clock there were no horses in the stable then - they were all at work I went out on a journey and returned about four in the afternoon - I went to my stable and saw a black stallion pony with a long tail I afterwards saw the same pony in possession of Pople and Curtis the officers - I know it was the same Cross-examined Q You took notice of it A Yes I had seen it in my journey - I met the prisoner and Moffatt with a cart one horse was in the shafts of the cart one tied to the shafts and this black pony following behind either tied or very close to the cart - there was no man in the cart Moffatt was behind the cart and the prisoner about twenty yards behind him - I do not know where Liphook is but I met them on the road between the Uxbridge and the Bath roads about ten o clock on the Saturday morning I did not see them talk together but they were going in a direction towards Moffatt s house - I am sure there were only two men I had known the prisoner about two months - he had slept at my house abouta week before I had never seen him buy or sell horses - he had put one up I did not take particular notice of the left ear of the pony - the whole ear was not off there might be a bit of it off it was a white-faced pony - the greater part of his face was white I did not see that he had white legs - I did not notice the two fore-legs but it was a stallion - it had a long tail a white face and the pony I saw at Union-hall was the same pony the legs might have been all white for what I know - the tall was not white the prisoner slept at my house on the Saturday night and had a cup of tea there on Sunday morning - I saw no secrecy about him MR CLARKSON Q This was about ten o clock A Yes - I saw the pony in possession of the officer the next day and knew it to be the same RICHARD POPLE I am an officer of Union-hall I heard of the loss of Elson s horses and in consequence of information I went down to Hayes with Curtis on the 16th of January - we went to a cottage about one hundred yards from the Bee Hive I understand that is about forty miles from Lipbook but I do not know it - when we got to the cottage Curtis went in first the door opens into the kitchen and I saw a bay mare standing before the fireplace - I heard a noise backwards and ran to the back door I saw a woman holding her hand out - I saw the prisoner running across the orchard and Curtis after him Curtis had a pair of pistols and I heard him threaten to shoot the prisoner if he did not stop - the prisoner had got over a gate and a ditch into the road I returned to the kitchen - the mare was still there I looked and saw some hair about and I saw the mare had been cropped in the fetlocks - I then went to the stable belonging to the house and found the two stallions the prisoner the two stallions and the mare were all brought to London - they all had long tails Mr Elson saw them and claimed them Cross-examined Q Did you see nobody else at the cottage but the woman and the prisoner A I saw no other person in the cottage - I saw a man outside the door I did not speak to him - I will swear I did not say to him Did not I see you somewhere before I do not recollect that Curtis spoke to him - he might and I not hear it I was not asked on the last trial any thing about seeing the mare outside - he was about twenty yards from the road he was perhaps ten or twenty yards from the cottage - I think he was coming from it I did not see him come out of it - I really do not recollect seeing Curtis at the moment I saw that man he might be engaged in the stable - he did not speak to the man in my presence I saw a chaise on the premises - I did not ask that man whose it was but I think I asked the prisoner ROBERT CURTIS I am an officer of Union-hall I went with Pople to Hayes on the 16th of January - we went to a cottage in the neighbourhood of the Bee Hive I went in first - I saw a mare in the room I saw a woman in a passage leading to another room wave her hand as if to some person in the back part of the house - I ran to the back door and saw the prisoner crossing an orchard he went through a hedge and then over a gate into the road- I called to him presented a pistol and said I would shoot him if he did not stop I took him back to the kitchen and saw a trifle of hair had been clipped off from the fetlock joint of the mare - we then went to the stable where I saw two ponies one was brown and the other black with a streak of white down the face - we took them and the mare to London showed them to Elson on the Thursday following and he identified them as his property Mrs Kitching saw the black pony and said she believed it was the one she had seen at the stable and Mr Kitching said it was the same when we got to the Adam and Eve about a quarter of a mile from the Bee Hive where my horse and chaise was the prisoner said he did not live at the cottage I asked where he did live - he said he lodged at the Bee Hive I asked him when - he said The whole of last week Cross-examined Q Did you see any man at the cottage or near the cottage where you saw the woman A yes there were persons in the road - I saw a man and spoke to him but did not ask him any question I saw a chaise in the yard belonging to the stable Q Did you ever say you believed this man stole the pony A No I believe he was in league with others -I never did say I believed he stole the pony individually Q Did you ever swear it now be careful for your own sake A No I never was asked the question I never said that at the time the pony was stolen he was passing through the turnpike-gate in a direction from the place where it was stolen from I said three men were seen I did not say he was one of them - it was before the prisoner was tried for stealing them that I said I could prove three men passed through the turnpike-gate Q Did you ever say this or any thing like it that you could bring evidence to prove that the prisoner was seen coming from the road leading from Liphook towards the Bee Hive A I have said that witnesses could prove that three men were seen - I do not know the prisoner was one I never said I could have witnesses to prove that the prisoner was seen on the road - I said three men were seen at a village below Q Was it not upon your swearing at Union-ball that you believed the prisoner stole the horses that he was remanded A No he was remanded on the charge of having committed divers felonies and horse-stealing in the County of Hants MR CLARKSON Q Did you afterwards show the prosecutor the horses A Yes and he identified them COURT to THOMAS KITCHING SEN Q You have stated that on the morning of the 15th of January you met Moffatt with a cart a horse tied to the shaft and another tied behind A I will not say he was tied - he was very close to the cart that was between two and three miles from my house and it was about ten o clock as near as I can guess COURT to ROBERT CURTIS Q Did you at any time state that you believed this man stole the horse A I believed that till I was convinced by what passed in the other Court that it was not so COURT to MRS KITCHING Q Could not the prisoner as easily have taken the pony to the house where the mare was found as he could have brought him to your house A Yes it is about the same little distance from the road Prisoner s Defence My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - I leave it to them to answer whether I should have taken the pony to the Bee Hive if I had known it was stolen - I am quite innocent GUILTY Aged 24 - Transported for Fourteen Years

there was not water enough to get it out of the lock it being a wet morning I drew the water out of the lock I did not see the timber go through but I am well aware it did go through - Foreman did not have it put down to Mr Dixon s account in the usual way he said it was a job of his own and he paid me for it JAMES WHITE I am in the employ of a wharfinger at Stone-stairs wharf Ratcliff On the 8th of April 1831 the prisoner came to my master s wharf a little after six o clock in the morning and said he wanted a piece of timber landed a man named Baxter came there afterwards and joined the prisoner up the wharf they asked me to get the handle on the crane to land the timber but I saw no timber and wanted them to come in out of the wet - I opened the shed for them to come in the prisoner then said he wanted a piece of timber landed very bad for the sawyers was standing still and so was the building - in about half an hour I saw a stick of timber brought by Foreman I did not notice in what direction it came as I was busy getting the handles on the crane and the dogs - it seemed to me to come up as the tide was coming up they then asked me to lower the crane for the timber - I said they had better wait till there was a little more water but they were in a hurry and they got the dogs out to land it- if they had waited a quarter of an hour they could have landed it without the crane when they had got it on the cart the prisoner asked what the wharfage was -

next morning they came to our house again to breakfast and while they were at breakfast I gave the prisoner a second cup of coffee Baxter said he could very well afford to pay for it as he had given him 5s more for the timber than he had agreed for and the prisoner said had he not been distressed for money he could not have afforded to sell it to him or to his own father for that and he could not have sold it at that rate had he not had it in liea of some laths of a man and his son who had set up a new timber yard in the Commercial-road -

I opened it when I wanted a book and I might have left the counting-house leaving the key in the chest it must have been taken out of the iron chest - I stopped it at the Bank and advertised it it was No 9295 dated September the 1st 1832 - I have not seen it since I never saw the prisoner before the Bank note was lost - I received information from Jones and went to his house on the Monday following I went to the prisoner s house twice but did not see him - I then applied to Prendergrass and he went with me to a street in which was the court the prisoner lived in I waited in the street while he went to the prisoner s house Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q I believe you first considered the note was accidentally lost A My confidence in my servants was so great I could not make up my mind that it was stolen and having had it in my pocket a day or two after I received it I thought I must have lost it and advertised it accordingly offering 10l reward and stating the number date and amount - it was to be brought to Mr Biggs No 41 Hounsditch looking at a newspaper dated 27th of October this is the advertisement I afterwards had reason to alter my opinion I missed the note late on the night of the 25th I called at the prisoner s house on the Monday after the advertisement in consequence of a communication from Mr Jones and Mr Biggs I found Levy was not at home I left word for the prisoner that I called about the 50l note and he called at my house the following day - I had called on him twice but had not seen him Q Did he state to you that he knew nothing about the 50l note A He did not - my memory will not enable me to recollect what was said he said something about a porter who formerly lived with me he merely said I have come about this 50l note have you a porter in your employ named B Lee I said I have the prisoner was a perfect stranger to me - Prendergrass had been to his house that morning RICHARD JONES I live with my uncle in Raven row Spitalfields - he is a grocer On Friday the 26th of October Mrs Battye came to the shop about three or four o clock in the afternoon with a 50l note in her hand and asked our young man to give her change - I gave her change for it - I knew her before perfectly well I did not know of the prosecutor s loss then - she bought nothing - I gave her the full change on Saturday morning I saw an advertisement in the Times respecting the note I sent for Mr Levy who I knew before - Battye had said she had come from Levy the prisoner came into the shop - I asked him to walk into the counting-house which he did I said to him I gave you the change for a 50l note on Saturday which I hope you will give me back he said What is the matter is it a forged one I said No but I hope and trust you will give it me back he said I will give you 20l which I have in my pocket-book and will go and fetch you the rest directly this was about nine o clock in the morning he gave me the 20l and then asked me what was the matter - I said It is a lost note and you will get something by it now for there is 10l reward offered for it he went and brought me the 30l and I returned him the note I am certain it was the same number and date as the note advertised - I compared them before I delivered it to him - he said he should take it back to the person I said You will get the 10l reward he said he wanted to get nothing by it - he is a master boot and shoemaker I said to him How did you come by it he said that he and another picked it up in Houndsditch on the Thursday morning - he did not say who the other person was - I did not ask him when I gave him the note he followed it up and pointed out where it had been trod den upon - it had either been trod on or got dirty in a person s pocket - I have never seen the note since my uncle was out of town - he returned late on the Saturday evening I mentioned this to him on the Sunday - I went to Levy on the Monday morning and said Well Mr Levy have you taken back the note - he said Yes I gave it to the person I took it of he did not say who that was I said I thought you meant to take it back to the person who lost it he said he did not mean any such thing as that but meant to give it to the person he had it from - and said he would give me the person s address from whom he had it but heshould like to see the person first himself - he said he could not see him till after nine o clock at night as he was out to work and after that he would call on me at half-past nine - he did not call I did not receive from him any address or description of the other person till I was at the Police-office - he was taken up the next day I went twice on the Monday with Mr Chidwick but he was not at home Mr Levy called on me on Tuesday morning about ten o clock and said What do you want with me Mr Jones I said I do not want you hut said that Mr Biggs or Mr Chidwick wanted to see him respecting the note he went away saying he would go there - I did not see him again till he was at the office Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q He said he would go to Mr Biggs A To him or Mr Chidwick I cannot say which he meant - I did not think myself entitled to any of the reward had I not known him to be a respectable man I should not have given change - he lives in a private house he came to me with the change - and afterwards on the Tuesday - I believe he went to the Police-office of his own accord - he went with Biggs and Chidwick I had known Mrs Battye some years - there was no concealment where she brought the note from I stated at the second examination about his saying he had picked the note up - I did not think it necessary to state it before but at the second examination the Magistrate asked what he said I did not go to Mr Biggs when I saw the advertisement because I gave Levy the opportunity - I should have thought it very unhandsome to have gone without seeing Levy I had a right to the 50l back - there was nothing to prevent his absconding if he thought proper the Magistrate admitted him to bail at the third examination and he has surrendered here COURT Q Did you ever see the 50l note after you returned it to the prisoner A Never JANE BATTYE I live at No 2 Dolphin-court Ravenrow Spitalfields I have known Levy about three years and a half On Friday the 26th of October I received this 50l note from him - he said if he had change for that note he would pay my husband what he owed him he lives next door to me - he owed my husband 10s 6d I took the note to Jones to get change the same day - I had known Jones a long time I got change for it and took it home to my own room - I gave it to Levy he did not pay me the 10s 6d - I did not speak to him about it he has not paid it to my knowledge - I did not ask how he came by the note nor did he tell me he went out of the room and I did not see any thing more of him till Prendergrass fetched me I went to the office and was examined there I do not know how he got the note Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q I believe he is in a large way of business A Yes - he employs a good many people I work for him - he came to my room on this occasion I did not go to him - he did not tell me to go to Jones nor ask me to get change he held the note in his hand and said if he had change for it he would pay my husband - I took it out of his hand and got change he did not desire me to conceal it - I am well known in the neighbourhood to be in his employ I brought him forty sovereigns and two 5l notes - I did not ask where he got the note I should consider him too respectable for that Q Do you remember his saying This is not mine A Yes - I remember his saying those words when he took the change out of my hand COURT Q Did he say whose it was A No I should have gone for the change if he had asked me if he had said nothing about paying my husband I am in the habit of going to Jones for change ELIZABETH BLUMSON I live at No 6 Tillet-street Tenter-ground Spitalfields my husband is a carpenter On going up to Mr Lee s room on Sunday afternoon he lodged in the some house as me I found Mr and Mrs Lee much agitated and asked what was the matter -

he held it in his hand and I read it in his hand it was dated the 1st of Sept 1832 - I did not observe the number Lee is a journeyman cabinet-maker - I knew he worked in Houndsditch I have not seen him since the Sunday evening - he eloped that night and the wife went on Monday he did not change his clothes after showing me the note SAMUEL PRENDERGRASS I am an officer On Tuesday the 30th of October the prisoner surrendered himself to me at Lambeth-street office I told him there was information laid at the office about his having a 50l note and questioned him - he said he should not state any thing to me but before the Magistrate he would state the particulars Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Perhaps you know the character of the prisoner A I have made inquiry and find he bears a very honest industrious character - he surrendered at the office I did not see the prosecutor with him then but I did almost immediately after he made a statement at the office - I had been to his house with Mr Chidwick about half-past ten o clock on Tuesday morning he was not at home - I saw his brother and left a message for him that I had called about the note and he surrendered in about two hours EDWARD WILLIAM LILLEY I am a tallow-chandler and live in Raven-row Spitalfields On Saturday the 27th of October about nine o clock in the morning Mr Jones brought the Times newspaper to me and desired me to step into the house which I did while I was there Levy came in - I went into the counting-house with him and Jones Levy put down 30l in gold which made 50l altogether on the table as there were two 5l notes and 10l in gold laying on the table previous to my going in -I took a 50l note in my hands which laid on the table and said to Levy This note is advertised - of course you know who you took it of he said I found it he took the note in his hands and doubled it twice putting a soiled part to the back of it - and said that to ascertain whether it was good he had sent to Mr Jones for change I held the newspaper in my hand and said If you found this note you have the claim for the reward I put the newspaper before him and showed him the address where it was to be taken to and with that we separated - he said he had found it I have not seen the note since - he didnot say when he had found it nor whether he was alone at the time Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Do you mean to say the questions were put to him by you and not Jones A I put them as I have stated I do not recollect Jones putting any questions - I am certain my questions and answers are correct I made no memorandum of them but am sure I am correct - I am certain he said he found the note I was there the whole time - I was not precisely attending to all that passed but what I have said is correct I attended to no other part of the conversation - the whole might occupy fifteen minutes Prisoner s Defence The only remark that will fall from me is simply this - Mr Lee called on me on Friday afternoon and asked me to obtain for him change for a 50l note which I did and on Saturday morning Jones told me it was advertised I immediately returned him the change and told him I should take the note and return it to Lee who I had it from RHIMA LEVY I am the prisoner s mother I remember Lee being at my son s house on the last Sunday in October and I myself gave Lee the 50l note which I fetched down from my drawer my son had given it to me the day before when he received it from Jones I cannot say at what time I gave it to Lee - it was between light and dark I got the 50l note from a drawer where I put it when my son gave it to me when he came back from Mr Jones when I gave the note to Lee I told him he should go and receive the reward - he then left the house Moses Levy and Catherine Abrahams were present COURT Q When did you first get the 50l note A On the Saturday the day before I cannot read nor can I read writing at all - I knew it was a 50l note because I knew the number I cannot remember the number Q How did you know the number if you cannot read A I cannot tell - I knew there was a reward offered because my son had read the paper and sent Lee to go and get it - my son was present when I gave the note to Lee - I had never seen the fellow before - my son was never acquainted with him I am certain he knew his wife by her binding shoes for him - I did not know he was her husband my son said Get down the note mother and give it to this man it is his and he found it - I did not go to the office with my son on Tuesday I cannot say when I first gave this account -

I opened it and a man was there - I asked what he wanted he said It is of no great consequence I wanted to see your brother - my brother was not at home he did not go away - he did not see my brother he went away and returned again - my brother was not at home then - he came again in the evening part and saw my brother between four and five o clock - my brother had not come home the second time but when he went out he met him and they both returned together - my brother said Mother you know the 50l note I gave you yesterday morning - go up stairs and fetch it and give it to Mr Lee - my mother went up fetched the note and delivered it into Mr Lee s hands I had no opportunity of seeing what note it was nor the amount I could see it was a note my brother said to Mr Lee There is a reward for this note of 10l go to Mr Biggs No 41 Houndsditch and be sure to receive the reward - I did not know Lee nor his wife nor where they lived COURT At what time did your brother return with Lee on Sunday A Between four and five o clock I cannot say what sort of a day it was it was between light and dark on the 28th I did not ask to look at the note my mother can read but not well she cannot read writing she can read a plain book I had a candle at that time to do my work I was at work in the opposite room the transaction took up about four or five minutes it was on the ground floor - I did not learn from my brother where the Lee s lived when the inquiry was made I understood they lived at the Tenter-ground my mother is rather infirm I went with my brother to the office I did not go with him but I was at the office he was there about half an hour before me - I cannot say at what time I went there it was before dinner - we dine sometimes at three and sometimes at two o clock I had no communication with the Justice - I was in the office when my brother was there but not when he was held to bail Q Did you leave your brother without seeing the end of it A I was rather too late he had been held to bail before I got there he did not walk home with me Mr Levy and Mr Thomas were his bail - I gave no account of this at the office I gave this account previously when the brief was drawn up I was not present when the brief was drawn up but I was when it was finished - that was last Thursday I did not mention this to any body from the Tuesday when my brother surrendered down to the 28th of November my brother did not show me the note Q Did you ever tell Mr Jones or Mr Chidwick they were very wrong in thinking your brother had received the note knowing it to be stolen because he had returned it to Lee A No MR BODKIN Q Did you ever see Jones or Chidwick after the Sunday A I saw Jones on Monday evening and told him the note was delivered to Lee then COURT Q You said before that you had not mentioned it till the brief was drawn last Thursday A I mean I did not speak to any body about the concern till the brief was made out -

Lee went away but Levy told him to deliver the note to Biggs and he would get the 10l reward COURT Q You say Levy was at home - is he your brother A No my cousin - he had been at home as near as I can guess about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before Lee came in it was a little before five o clock - I am quite sure Levy had been at home ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before Lee came - it was about that not above ten minutes nobody came into the house with Lee - I am certain Levy did not come in with him I am positive of it - I saw the note in Mrs Levy s hands when she brought it down stairs I saw a 50l note in her hands - she said it was 50l I had not the note in my hands - I saw it near enough to know it was a 50l note but not to see the number I am certain it was a 50l note I did not read the note but when Lee took it in his hand he said Oh this is the 50l note and Levy said Mind you go and receive the reward of 10l I could see the mark of 50l on it Q How was it marked A The same as notes are - in figures I think but I did not notice it Q If you did not notice it how can you tell it was a 50l note A Because at the time I saw it I could explain it but I did not know I should be called on about it Q Did you see fifty in words or figures A I do not exactly recollect Mr Lee looked over it twice and repeated that it was 50l Q He might tell you a falsehood A That is not my fault the prisoner said Here is the 50l note -

t18321129-98  199 ROBERT SMITH was indicted for feloniously receiving on the 25th of March of a certain evil-disposed person 8 glazed window-sashes value 8l the goods of John Puckeridge well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c MR CLARKSON conducted the prosecution JOHN PUCKERIDGE I am a watchmaker and live in King-street Snow-hill - I have a house at No 38 Richard-street Liverpool-road Islington In March last it was to let on the 23rd of that month two ladies called about it and in consequence of what they said I sent my son to the station-house - in the evening I went to the house in Richard-street found the back shutter broken open and eight sashes gone - I had seen them safe a few days before on the 25th of March I went with Collins and King to the Hornsey-road into a house belonging to the prisoner the officer knew it to be his - I found two of my sashes in the first floor front room near to the window - the house was nearly finished it wanted sashes and painting only we then went into a little back house about twenty yards distant and there I found two more sashes concealed behind some wood - they were also mine and were a portion of those stolen from my house in Richard-street we then went to the prisoner s house in Copenhagen-street - we found him at home -Collins asked for him and he came out Collins then asked him if he had any sashes he said he had nothing of the kind that he had nothing but some old lumber in the yard - the officer went into the yard and I followed - he looked into the yard there was nothing there but on looking in at the kitchen window he saw some sashes I looked at them but did not know them then - we went into the kitchen and I found them to be mine they had been chopping at the tenons as if to cut them off - one ofthem is off and the stile is taken off there were some chips about - Mr Smith came down into the kitchen and the officer asked him how he came by the sashes - he said he could not tell what to say the officer then said he had found four more sashes in his houses in the Hornsey-road he still said he did not know what to say and he said so several times on his road to the station-house when he got there he said to the officer who took it down that he had them of a man named Church who lived at Bethnal-green he had not mentioned that before - these are the sashes I have no doubt they are mine they were new when I bought the house Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you know the prisoner A I knew him by having seen him in the next yard I then thought him to be the father of the person who lived there - I have since heard he is a person of property I went before Mr Laing the Magistrate on the 26th of March - I did not state all that I have stated now - I was asked but very little I did not state that the prisoner said he did not know what to say but I belive it was stated by one of the officers - I will not swear it I answered all the questions that were put to me I cannot take upon me to swear that I did say that the prisoner could not tell what to say but I think I did the prisoner was discharged on giving his own security for 100l - I think he appeared three times I do not know that the Magistrate then discharged him altogether - orders were given to the officer to try and find the thief I went before the Grand Jury last Session as I found the thieves had not been discovered and the house remained in a delapidated state - I had not been to the prisoner s house after the 25th of March I went back to his house that day as I did not know there was any one to tell his wife that he would not come back - I do not remember seeing his daughter there I do not remember ordering his daughter out of the room as I had something to say that I did not want any witnesses to- I have no recollection of the kind but I will not swear that I did not Mr George Finch is a broker - he had lived for six months in the next house to mine I never had any conversation with him I did not know where he lived afterwards but he came tampering with me he did not say he had come in consequence of something I had said to the prisoner s wife - he called on me and said he understood I particularly wished to see him I swear I did not say I did not wish to see Mr Smith but I was surprised he should lay himself open to become the purchaser of such property he did not say that the sashes should be replaced until the thief was taken - he came to me in the character of a house-agent asked if my house was to let and whether I was inclined to dispose of it - I said I had been very unfortunate with it and that two tenants had gone away and robbed me of nearly 50l - I asked him what character he came in for I was very doubtful of him as I had seen him with the prisoner I said I should have no objection to part with the house for 240l I did not say that I had a house to sell for 240l and that he must understand what I meant nor that people must expect to make sacrifices in the situation in which the prisoner was - I was too cautious for I knew Finch s character too well I did not say if money was not quite convenient there was plenty to be had on good security at 5 per cent I told him if he found me a customer for the house he should have his commission on it I did not say I did not care who I sold it to and of course all would end I have no recollection of saying that I should trouble myself no more about the matter as I was not bound over to prosecute but I cannot take upon myself to say - I am seventy years of age and my memory may not serve me - I have not been a prosecutor before when Finch called on me the sashes were at Mr Wormald s MR CLARKSON Q Finch came to you in the character of a house-agent A Yes he said this was a very serious thing and I said I wished to know what character he came in - he said he was a house-agent and he understood I had a house to let I did not send for him nor did I send word that I wanted to see Smith Finch said he understood my house was to let or to be disposed of - I said I could not let it in that state but if he could get me a customer for it he would get his commission JAMES COLLINS Police-constable N 160 I went in company with the prosecutor to some premises in the Hornsey-road which belong to the prisoner we went into an unfinished house and found some sashes in the first floor front room - the prosecutor identified them we then went into another house at the back which was also unfinished and there found another pair of sashes behind some boards - the prosecutor identified them we then proceeded to the prisoner s house in Copenhagen-street about two miles from Hornsey-road King my brother officer went into the house be fore me - when I went into the house I asked Smith if he had any sashes - he said No he had none at all he could assure me he had none and he never kept any thing of the sort there he kept them at his shed or at his building I then asked if he had a shed at the back of his house - he said No but he had a yard with some old rubbish in it - I went immediately down into the yard - the prosecutor followed me - King was then gone when I got into the yard I looked through the kitchen window and saw some sashes standing in the middle of the room - Smith was then on the stairs we proceeded to the kitchen and found two sashes there one of which was broken and there were some chips on the ground Puckeridge said he verily believed them to he his I asked the prisoner how he came by them - he said he had bought them and given 9d or 9 1/2d a foot for them I told him I had found four others in the Hornsey-road - he said he had bought altogether seven or eight pairs I took him to the station and he there said he bought them of a man named John he had before said he had bought them of a man named Church and two or three of his men and he afterwards said he bought them of Church s man John Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Have you told us all that passed A Yes to the best of my recollection I was near to Mr Puckeridge the whole time and heard all that passed - the prisoner first said he had them of Church and two or three of his men and then he saidhe had them of Church s man John he did say on the second occasion that he hardly knew what to say - this was when I found the two sashes in the kitchen I do not know what he meant by it - I believe he is in a large way of business I was before the Magistrate - there was but little stated there I did not hear the prosecutor state what passed with the prisoner - I knew I could find the prisoner when I wanted him the sashes were left at Mr Wormald s - I told the prosecutor I would leave them there and he made no answer MR CLARKSON Q Had you seen the prisoner from the time he was discharged till the bill was found against him A Yes twenty times and I once asked him if he had found the man he had given a description of -I took two persons to him and another person was pointed out to him but he could not identify either of them one of Church s men was taken to him and Church was taken - he said that was not the person he bought them of his man John - John has not been taken I cannot find him I have been in the prisoner s house but once since he was taken THOMAS HOBBS KING Police-constable N 248 I went with Collins and the prosecutor to the Hornsey-road and then to the prisoner s house I saw the prisoner and told him I had an unpleasant piece of business to state to him and he asked me into the parlour - I then told him Mr Puckeridge had lost a number of sashes from a house in Richard-street and from information I had been to some houses belonging to him in Hornsey-road where I had found four sashes and I asked how he became possessed of them - he said he bought them of a man named Church I asked where he lived - he gave me a pen and ink and a piece of paper and I put down the address at Bethnal-green in the mean time Collins and the prosecutor came in I had to be on duty at one o clock and left them I went with Collins the same afternoon to Chuch and saw him HENRY WORMALD I live in Mount-row Liverpool-road I am a painter and glazier I have had the care of these sashes I have fitted them to the prosecutor s house in Richard-street and they belong to it to the best of my judgment Cross-examined Q I suppose every house of the same size would require the same sized sashes A Yes but here is one half-sash I can swear to - it had been in the front parlour I had seen it while it was in and remarked it - I should think 9 1/2d a foot a fair price for them Prisoner s Defence I gave a fair price for them and bought them of Church s man he told me he bought them from Church - I bought them on the 3rd of March and had them till the 20th I then sent them in the middle of the day up to the house at Hornsey MR MALLETT I am chief clerk to the Magistrate at Hatton-garden I took the examinations in this case on the 26th of March I have no recollection of any statement being made that the prisoner had given contrary accounts how he became possessed of them or that he at first said he did not know what to say - the prisoner was discharged on his own recognizances to appear on the Saturday which he did MR CLARKSON Q May Collins have stated that the prisoner said he did not know what to say and you not to take it down A He might it was a very hasty examination as the thief was not in custody GEORGE FINCH I am an appraiser and live in George-place Holloway I know the prisoner I called on Mr Puckeridge and had some conversation with him in the course of which he said he did not particularly wish to see Mr Smith but he was surprised he should lay himself open to purchase such property - I told him the sashes should be replaced till the thief was taken he said he had a house to sell for 240l and I must understand what he meant - he said people must expect to make sacrifices in such cases as Mr Smith s and if money was not quite convenient there were plenty to be had on good security at 5 per cent - he said he did not care who he sold the house to and of course all would end he said he should have no house nor trouble himself more about the matter as he was not bound over to prosecute - I had before this been to Mr Harmer and told him what Mrs Smith had said to me he said it was a very delicate point but there would be no impropriety in my going to Mr Puckeridge and telling him the sashes should be replaced till the thief was brought forward - I had only seen Mr Puckeridge at the office when the case was brought forward I was agent for Mr Smith on several occasions I know there was such a man as Church and I had heard that Mr Smith had dealt with him for sashes and other things - I know Church had a servant named John or Jack I have been to inquire for him but cannot find him - we have offered a reward for any information about him I went to inquire for Church about a fortnight or three weeks back - his house was shut and I could get no account of him MR CLARKSON Q Had you ever seen Jack A I saw him once with Church - I am in the service of Mr Smith occasionally he wished me to accompany him to the office - I had been once to a Police-office before on a disputed levy that was on Mr Smith s account - I am agent for other persons and for Mr Williams of Hatton-garden office - I swear most positively before God that I did not tell the prosecutor that the windows should be put in if he would forego the prosecution - I had retained Mr Harmer as Mr Smith s solicitor at his request - then I went by Mr Harmer s advice to the prosecutor and proposed to replace the sashes - I knew they were at that time in possession of the officer Mrs Smith first requested me to go to Mr Puckeridge but I saw Mr Smith about it before I went - I saw Church three or four weeks ago on some premises belonging to Mr Smith in George-yard Islington Mr Smith said he must give him a job that he might know where he was and set him to solder a piece of iron - I lived next door to the house from which these sashes were taken shortly before they were lost - I have to collect the rents of six houses in Pierpoint-rents for Mr Sage of Pimlico and I have distrained on them twenty or thirty times - I live now in one of Mr Smith s houses I saw Jack in Liverpool-road with Church and another man about eight months ago - I have never seen him since Church is a plumber painter and glazier MR ADOLPHUS Q Had you seen Church Smith and Jack together A Yes and I heard Jack called by that name - I have not been retained by Smith as aregular servant but only to do such jobs as he desired me I have been eight years an appraiser and broker - when Puckeridge said he had been at such considerable loss I said I would undertake to replace the sashes as they were before upon condition that if the thief was found he should pay Mr Smith any expence he had been at JOHN STONE I am a sawyer and live in Sermon-lane Liverpool-road I know Church he had two men in his employ who used to come to my house with him one of the men was called Jack - I have not seen him since the beginning of March he called at my house about that time and brought two old sashes - he asked if Mr Smith was at my house I said No he left the sashes about ten minutes and then fetched them away MR CLARKSON Q What are you besides a sawyer A I keep a little beer shop just at the back of the prosecutor s premises - Mr Smith is in the habit of paying his men at my house very often Smith knew Jack and they have drank at my house frequently but Church and his man were more frequently there than Smith was - I never saw Smith and Jack there without Church I had no suspicion when these sashes were brought to my shop- I had worked for Mr Smith - on the morning after the sashes were brought to my house a person named Davis told me they were improperly come by and he believed he could point out the house from which they came - I have never seen Jack since the time he brought the sashes - Church and Smith came to my premises about a month ago they had some beer and talked together I did not give any information when Davis told me what he did - I did not know Mr Puckeridge Davis showed me the place but I did not go to the Police-station MR ADOLPHUS Q Who is Davis A A shoemaker - he did not say he had seen them stolen or knew who stole them but he said he saw a man come into my house with them and he thought something was wrong I have seen Smith and Church since that time in company but I have not seen Jack with them I have never looked after Jack - I have seen Smith and Church together till within about a month I have not looked for Church since COURT Q Did you say to Davis I can tell you who was the man that stole them it was Jack A No - I had no idea that they were stolen MARY HAMBROOK I am the prisoner s daughter I recollect seeing the prosecutor about the 25th of March he came to my father s house - my mother was there he wished me to leave the room as he wished to speak to my mother alone I left the room and he staid about a quarter of an hour HENRY ST JOHN LANGDON I am a builder I have known the prisoner thirty years - he has had an honest character I should think 9d or 9 1/2d a foot a good price for these sashes as they are now we give 1s a foot for glazing them MR CLARKSON Q Are you in the habit of buying sashes A Yes I knew Church kept a new beer-shop next door to me in the Hornsey-road two years ago COURT Q Are not these sashes worth a great deal more than 9d a foot when fixed A Yes GUILTY Aged 51 -

remittance to Hooper and Askew - I was to send them one hundred and eighty-five pounds - I gave my wife about one hundred and forty or one hundred and forty-five pounds in Glastonbury notes for that purpose and desired her to make up the quantity one hundred and eighty-five pounds and remit it in a letter on Tuesday morning I had information that it had not arrived SARAH PIKE I am the wife of the last witness Onthe 3rd of March my husband gave me a letter which he wrote to send to London and one hundred and forty-five pounds of Glastonbury notes - I took the numbers of them and put other notes

Co you cannot tell A No THOMAS LUFF I am a letter-carrier in the post office It would be my duty to deliver all letters for Hooper and Co Thames-street - on the 4th of March I delivered them only one and that was all that was given me to deliver - I sometimes deliver them to a boy WILLIAM CROOK I was clerk to Hooper and Co Thames-street On the 4th of March I received a letter for them by the general post - I gave it to Mr Askew - I recollect it came from Hull WILLIAM ASKEW I am a cheese-agent and one of the firm of James Hooper and Askew there is one other partner On the morning of the 4th of March a letter was delivered to me by the last witness I recollect it this is the letter it came from Hull - I received no letter from Salisbury that morning and have never received the one enclosing one hundred and forty-five pounds Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Is it the duty of other persons to receive your letters A The postman gives them to whoever is present - we have only one clerk we have a warehousman and two boys who sometimes receive letters but Crook is the only one in the counting-house - no third person has any share in our business WILLIAM SIMPSON I am clerk to Messrs Masterman and Co who are agents to the Glastonbury bank On the 20th of March the prisoner came to our house and brought two 10l and two 5l Glastonbury bank notes which I produce we had received a notice about Glastonbury bank notes before that - I at first asked him what he would have for them and then referred to the book and saw they were part of those desired to be stopped by the Post-office solicitor - he said he would have gold for them I asked his name and address he said Cohen Edgware-road - when I found they had been stopped I went and spoke to one of the principals and showed him the notes and Mr Oxley required Cohen to come and speak to him - he told Cohen the notes had been stolen and payment was stopped by request of the Post-office - he was then asked if he had any objection to go to Hooper and Co Thames-street- he said no I went with him to Hooper and Co and saw Mr Hooper and told him the notes had been presented for payment he requested me to walk to Mr Peacock s office with Mr Cohen - which I did and saw Mr Peacock and told him what took place and the prisoner was detained - I asked him how he got the notes he said he took them from two men who were going to St Katherine s-docks to take a passage to New South Wales and at Mr Peacock s office there was a conversation a Mr Ramsay was present he and I went into Mr Peacock s room together I had shown Ramsay the notes before I went into the office I met Mr Hooper at the Post-office - Mr Peacock when he first saw the prisoner seemed very much surprised and said Mr Cohen is it you - and questioned him how he became possessed of the notes - he said he took them of two men who came to his shop and bought goods to the amount of 24l or 25l - their name and address were not on the notes but the prisoner s name and address had been put on since - he said he had them from two men going to New South Wales - Mr Peacock said that it was I think the third or fourth time he had had stolen notes in his possession the prisoner replied that it was only the third time Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q The notes are payable at your house A Yes - I did not know the prisoner before but his house of business was known to our house we occasionally had bills accepted by him in our hands - there was nothing whatever written on the notes when he brought them he went with me willingly to my principal we had received notice of the notes having been stolen about a week before or more - he went readily with me to Mr Hooper and gave his name and address at once he observed as we went to Hooper s that he had a cheque on Messrs Scott in Cavendish-square which he wished to get cashed and when it was proposed to go to Messrs Peacock s office he wished to go to the Minories - a 100l note and the cheque he spoke of was found on him these bills of his have all passed through our house - looking at them they amount to above five hundred pounds MR ADOLPHUS Q Did any bills of his pass through your house under suspicious or dangerous circumstances A Some notes which had been received from him for his acceptances had been stated to be stolen - I should not have detained him if he had not gone willingly with me as his name was known at our house JAMES HOOPER I am in partnership with Mr Askew On the 20th of March I remember going to Mr Peacock s office in the Post-office the prisoner and last witness were there and Mr Ramsay - when the prisoner was brought in Mr Peacock said Mr Cohen is this you again his answer was It is - Mr Peacock said How did you come in possession of these notes he said I took them of two men I have not their names they were going to St Katharine s-docks that he sold goods for the notes but did not recollect what kind of goods - Mr Peacock observed It is very strange you took these notes on Monday this is Wednesday and you do not recollect what you sold them for come try and recollect - he said Well perhaps half a dozen pair of trousers as many jackets and stockings - Mr Peacock said How did they take them away he said In bundles - Mr Peacock said They must be very large bundles to amount to twenty-three or twenty-four pounds and the prisoner accounted for about 7l or 8l worth - the prices were asked I believe he did not mention the prices but the calculations were made by Mr Peacock and myself - Mr Peacock told him according to calculation they would not amount to above seven or eight pounds they would not exceed ten pounds he stated that to the prisoner - to my best recollection I heard him say so and then he asked him who was in the shop at the time he sold the goods whether his shopman was there he said No he was asked Where was your shop man and said Out collecting - he was asked Where was he gone and said I don t know - At what time did he go out At two o clock - When did he return I don t know I cannot recollect but I believe it to be about tea-time about five o clock - Was any other person in your shop There might be part of my family my children - he was asked if he could not recollect the men if he saw them - I believe he said I did not know them - Cohen demanded the notes Mr Peacock said he should not give them up it was a case which will require very serious investigation and Mr Peacock said I believe this is the fourth time you have been here - his answer was It is only the third or It is the third Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Do you mean to represent that Mr Peacock mentioned the particular sum A He said it would not exceed ten pounds the prisoner was in the room but I don t know whether he spoke to him - I have no doubt he heard it but cannot be certain he was a few yards from Mr Peacock who addressed himself to all who where present not the prisoner in particular it was a general observation - I believe it was said that was but a small proportion he said he kept no books - we did not ask him the price of each article I made a calculation being competent to do so - according to the things generally sold in such shops which are usually a low sort of things I was never in his shop I fixed a very low price Q Did you understand them to be second-hand clothes A No but low-priced as it is a clothes-shop - I never dealt in clothes I once bought a low-priced top-coat for a person at one of these shops he said he sold them to two men and it is natural to suppose if he called them men they were not gentlemen - I believe Edgeware-road is not a very respectable place not the part I am speaking of - I live in Guildford-place Wilmington-square MR ADOLPHUS Q Was the observation about the goods not exceeding ten pounds made by you or Mr Peacock A I believe Mr Peacock said so or within a very few minutes I made the observation Mr Peacock said Don t you keep books - he said Not for daily taking but for accounts ROBERT WILLIAM PEACOCK I am brother to the solicitor of the Post-office I assist him in his business - I was present on the 20th of March when the prisoner was brought before him and examined respecting the notes- I took down in writing what passed - I only made memorandums but not of every thing that passed MR PHILLIPS Q Did you not take down what you thought principally made against him A Not exactly I took down what I thought right to refresh my memory COURT Q Refresh your memory by these memorandums and state what passed A On his entering the solicitor said Mr Cohen is that you he said Yes it is - he said Have you presented these notes at Masterman s he said Yes I have - How did you become possessed of them he said I took them on Monday afternoon last of two persons that he did not ask their names they had come in to fit themselves out and were going to New South Wales they purchased different kinds of articles - he was asked to enumerate them and said he could not - Mr Peacock said You must recollect this was only last Monday - he said There might be half a dozen pair of trousers stockings and shirts and he could not recollect any thing more - he was asked what amount the goods came to he said about twenty-three or twenty-four pounds - it was suggested to him that these articles could not amount to that but he could not recollect any others which he had sold- Mr Peacock said Mr Cohen you must remember this is the fourth time stolen notes have been traced into your possession - he immediately answered No Sir it is only the third - he said he made no entry in his books and could not give us the particulars of the articles that his shopman was gone out collecting debts at the time but he could not recollect where that he had written several letters he did not know to whom that nobody was present but his wife or some part of the family - he afterwards said the two persons had other notes in their possession it was remarked to him that the articles he had sold must be very large to amount to twenty-three pounds - he said they were rather heavy that he made them up in two parcels of brown paper he gave one to each and he understood they were going in an omnibus - I afterwards went with an officer and searched his premises and found several letters Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did you take down the number of articles he said he had sold A No I have taken down jackets shirts and trousers I believe I before mentioned stockings instead of jackets - I believe he mentioned four articles on a second conversation with him going to Bow-street he told me the number of the articles he had sold I am not aware that much more passed than I have taken down but I was not inthe room all the time - I am not aware that I have omitted any thing in his favour - a cheque and a hundred pound note were found on him and some sovereigns which I did not count - I have spoken to one person who lives in his neighbourhood but did not take him before any Justice - he was a Post-office letter-receiver living within a short distance of him I only asked him respecting certain persons supposed to reside in that neighbourhood - the prisoner s is a large shop COURT Q What in your judgment is the value of articles exposed for sale there A Some I should think not worth more than one shilling and sixpence there were coats perhaps as high as fifty shillings it appeared a new and second-hand clothes shop MR ADOLPHUS Q It was in the course of your duty to make such inquiries in the Edgeware-road as you thought proper A It was I only formed an opinion of the value of the articles - I believe as I left the office my brother was putting a value on the different articles which the prisoner had said he had sold - the prisoner has surrendered here to take his trial he was bound under a recognizance of one hundred pounds and four sureties of one hundred pounds each the prisoner said he had sold goods to the amount of twenty-three or twenty-four pounds for the notes I understood him to mean that he had given change for the rest but he did not say so THOMAS PORCH I belong to the Glastonbury Bank These notes are duly issued and signed there are no more of that number or date issued by the bank Prisoner s Defence written On the 18th of March last I was at Mr Flint s auction-rooms a few doors from my own house when my son came and told me that two men at home wanted to purchase some clothes I asked him if James meaning the shopman was at home he said no I then left the rooms when I came home there were two respectable looking men in the shop who said they were recommended to me to purchase some goods and that they had come from the country they each selected goods to about 11l or 12l They each paid me a 10l and 5l note of the Glastonbury bank payable at Masterman and Co after referring to my Directory I found the firm to be good I had no hesitation in taking them I gave each of them their change I then packed the goods in large sheets of paper and they took them saying they were going to St Katherine s Docks and they would take the omnibus they each took their parcels and left the shop I then returned to Mr Flint s auction-rooms On the Wednesday following I was going to Leaf Son and Co Old Change to purchase a quantity of shawls when I went with the notes in question to Masterman and Co to get them changed I presented them to Mr Simpson he asked my name and address which I gave him he then left me at the counter several minutes when one of the principals came out and said he was sorry to inform me but that these notes were stolen from a post-office letter and Mr Peacock had stopped the payment of them he then asked me if I would accompany Mr Simpson to Mr Hooper in Thames-street I said certainly Mr Simpson and myself went in together to Mr Hooper and on the way Mr Simpson asked me how I came in possession of the notes I told him as above stated when we came to Mr Hooper s Mr Simpson informed him I had tendered the notes for payment Mr Hooper said he could not say anything to it but that we had better go to the Post-office We then went together Mr Peacock asked me a great many questions how I came in possession of the notes which I answered him in the same way as I did Mr Simpson he then put a great many more questions which I answered not knowing he intended to make my answers evidence against me and to detain me if I had known that I would have reserved my answers until I came before a magistrate Mr Peacock then asked me if I had any objection to be searched I said I had none An officer was sent for he found in my possession nearly 200l for which I gave a satisfactory account and it was returned to me Mr Peacock then asked if I would allow an officer to search my house I said I had no objection and I gave Mr Peacock the key of my desk Mr Peacock with an officer took me to Bow-street and left me in custody at Bow-street They would not tell any of my family where I was until they had done making the search which took some time but what I had said at the Post-office was confirmed by my family at home although none of them knew where I was at the time Mr Peacock and the officer returned to Bow-street I was then taken to a private room before Mr Minshull and without being asked one single question as to the possession of the notes was remanded to the House of Correction and there kept in solitary confinement at the request of Mr Peacock until the Saturday following when after the evidence being gone into the magistrates were inclined to discharge me but Mr Peacock said if the magistrate would remand me he had no doubt he could bring further evidence against me upon that the magistrates remanded me for a week At the next examination Mr Peacock failed to bring any further evidence against me but requested the magistrate to hold me to bail to answer any charge that might be brought against me when I was held in two sureties of 50l each A day before the last sessions Mr Peacock called on me and said it was their intention to prefer an indictment against me I rendered at the last sessions and at a great expense I put off the trial using every means in my power since to trace the guilty party implicated but have failed to do so Gentlemen I have taken these notes in my business and I am entirely innocent of any guilty knowledge if I had I would not have gone to Messrs Masterman and Co where I must have been well known having paid at that house monies at different times to a large amount for bills of exchange accepted by me I have been in business upwards of twenty years during that time I never let a bill go unpaid and up to this present day my credit in the City of London is unlimited so that I could at a very short notice obtain credit to a large amount If I had been disposed to be dishonest I could have done that which this court could not have interfered with me for I return in my business between 4000l and 5000l per year how then can I avoid those impositions being practised on me If I refuse to take notes I may as well shut up my shop as some weeks I take 60l or 70l in notes and am in the habit continually of taking country notes living near the Paddington-canal where boats come from all parts of the country and coaches also I usually look to my Directory and if I find the bank good and the notes payable in London I never hesitate taking them I had witnesses at the Bow-street office that would have proved my innocence but the magistrates did not consider it a case to send to a jury therefore I had no defence to make Mr Peacock summoned two persons from my neighbourhood to give evidence against me at Bow-street - when they came there Mr Peacock examined them privately and finding their evidence went to serve me he did not call them Would any body but a madman have gone himself to the house of Masterman and Co knowing the notes to have been stolen and have given his own name and address 2ndly Would I have waited when I had many opportunities of going away never being in custody until Mr Peacock had arrived some time I could easily have left Mr Simpson but I willingly went after I was informed by Mr Hooper that the notes were stolen I trust gentlemen that these facts with my character will at once satisfy you of my innocence and restore me

I asked him to walk into the parlour and fetched my cousin who is a partner in the firm he went into the parlour to the prisoner but I did not - these are the spoons Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you think these are worth 5l A Yes MR ADOLPHUS Q Was it the disproportion of their apparent worth to what was asked which gave you suspicion A Yes it appeared they were worth more than £2 RICHARD ATTENBOROUGH I am a partner in the firm These spoons were given to me on the 10th of May they are worth about 4l - I was out at the time they were offered - I sent for an officer and gave the prisoner in charge - a quantity of jewellery of almost all descriptions was found in his pockets - one account he gave of the spoons was that he had had them of Edward Foster but he at first said they were his own and he had bought them at the west end of the town - I did not ask him about the jewellery - he gave his address at No 20 Anglesea-street Bethnal-green at Mrs Foster s the mother of Edward Foster I went there in the evening with the officer and Mr Banfield and saw a writing-desk opened which was said to belong to the prisoner and some spoons and other property was found in it - I had been to several places to make inquiry and at last found Mr Banfield s Cross-examined Q You found the account the prisoner gave you of where he lived and who he lived with was all right A Yes - I think these six spoons weigh form twelve to fourteen ounces I should not sell them for less than 7s 6d an ounce JOHN BANFIELD I am a silversmith and jeweller and live at No 36 Cheapside Edward Foster was in my employ between five and six years he had left me about three weeks before this discovery I had not missed any thing in particular up to the time he left me -

I sent for the officer and had him searched the officer has a list of what was found on him it is all my property - he said he had them of Edward Foster but I never knew of his being intimate with Foster I never saw him before - I asked him if he knew me he said Yes your name is Banfield - I took a coach and went with the prisoner to Mrs Foster the house contains four rooms in one of which Mrs Foster and her daughter slept the prisoner and Edward Foster in another and the front room up stairs seemed to be the general sitting room and in that room we found a great deal of my property and a plan of a card in Foster s hand-writing Cross-examined Q Had Foster been apprentice to you A No he had been in my service five or six years and when he gave me notice to quit he told me he was going to set up in business - the prisoner might have heard so from him - I don t know but that Foster had purchased some articles in the trade - there is my own private mark on these spoons but there is no mark by which any other person could know that they had not been sold or honestly come by - the prisoner said he had them from Foster and we found a great quantity of property at Foster s house - he slept with Edward Foster but I don t know whether he knew the property was not honestly come by MR ADOLPHUS Q Did Foster tell you he was going to take Attwood into business with him A No he did not say that he had other property in his pocket - I have lost between two and three hundred pounds worth of property - Foster came to me a poor lad without a shoe and I had advanced him to 25l a year wages and board he had just become useful to me THOMAS EAGLES I am an officer of Worship-street On the 10th of May I went to Mr Attenborough s and took the prisoner - the spoons were given to me I did not ask the prisoner about them but I searched him and found on him a great number of articles which I here produce some were in his coat pockets and some in his other pockets but all on his person - here is a coral necklace three gold seals a gold eye glass twelve rings a silver snuff box three pair of ear-rings a silver watch two seals a key a gold pin a steel guard chain and several other things - he said in my presence that they were given to him or that he had them from a person of the name of Edward Foster who he said lived in the same room with him at Mrs Foster s - he told us her direction we went there and in this writing desk which we broke open at that time but the key of which I afterwards found on the prisoner we found six plated table spoons six tea spoons six silver spoons and some other articles they are all marked S S A the desk was produced before the magistrate but I do not recollect that the prisoner said anything about it Cross-examined Q You have not found Edward Foster A No I have looked for him - I do not know whether he had taken any shop to set up in business WILLIAM ASTON I am in Mr Banfield s service - at the time Foster was in his service I have seen the prisoner come to see Foster very often after Mr Banfield had left THOMAS DAVIES I am a constable of Cheapside I watch that part near the prosecutor s shop - I knew Foster his shopman - I have seen the prisoner there with Foster when Mr Banfield was out of town Cross-examined Q Did you know that Foster wasabout setting up in business A Yes he told me so - I did not know of his purchasing any articles in the trade I knew him as shopman to Mr Banfield and have spoken to him - I saw him at Mrs Foster s in January - I saw a variety of goods there but no silver nor jewellery to my knowledge I think I can safely swear that - I saw a writing desk there but not open I saw no plate there - I saw no invoices of any goods he told me he had purchased some knives and forks MR ADOLPHUS Q Had you any particular acquaintance with Foster A No I knew him as living with Mr Benfield - I never was at his house but twice the first time I was there about half an hour and the second time about an hour and a half Foster told me he was going into partnership with a person named Attwood who lived with Mr Dudderidge of Whitechapel JAMES DUDDERIDGE I am a woollen-draper The prisoner was in my service but had left me about three months before he was taken -

t18330905-64  1267 RALPH BENJAMIN was indicted for feloniously receiving of a certain evil-disposed person 1224 yards of ribbon value 39l the goods of Thomas Dodd which had then been lately before stolen he knowing them to have been stolen 2ND COUNT stating them to be the goods of Thomas Bullock THOMAS BULLOCK I am agent to Thomas Dodd ribbon-manufacturer of Coventry my warehouse is No 3 Huggin-lane City On Friday morning the 16th of August in consequence of information I went to my warehouse and observed the lock was partly off the door the iron bar was off and the padlock broken off - I missed a lot of figured lustring ribbons and some figured satins my desk was broken open and I missed from it a cashbox containing a bill of exchange a 10l note a 5l note some sovereigns and some silver - in consequence of information I went to Spooner s in Chiswell-street I saw some ribbons and went in consequence of information to Lower White-cross-street I saw some lustring and satin ribbons about one-third of the quantity I lost Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q How long had the ribbons been in your possession A They were purchased about the 23rd of May and some on the 1st of June and I believe some since there are various patterns - we have sold some of the patterns and very likely we have sold some of each pattern I cannot swear we have not - they were spindled on a small paper not blocked when taken from my warehouse but when I found them at Lander s they were blocked and some of the ends changed - I never saw Lander before I had information first from the dresser and went to Spooner s who gave me information where he got them and then I went to Lander s - I know nothing of the prisoner except what was stated by Lander COURT Q Was the quantity you found at Lander s and the other place greater than the quantity you had sold or less A We had sold a much larger quantity there are so many patterns mixed together I usually average the price of different manufacturers goods and put all together at one price - I never sold a quantity of so many different patterns to one individual - at different times I dare say we had sold more of the same patterns MR ADOLPHUS Q You had the ribbons from Dodd A Yes he is not the original manufacturer of them there are three or four manufacturers - the lot was in my warehouse when I left the premises they were a little out of condition - I could pick out this lot of goods from others made by the same manufacturer because they were out of condition they were lying on the counter other people might have goods lying on the counter and out of condition - as a lot I could pick them out so as to be certain they were mine and nobody else s - it is possible others might be injured in the same way COURT Q Did you find as much as you had lost A About half I had lost sixty-eight pieces I found the same mixture of goods as I lost with the same marks of damage and some of each sort and in the same state and condition except that some had been put on blocks and some spindled but the ends altered - I believe them to be part of the property I lost the same mixture and assortment JURY Q Do you sell ribbons dressed or undressed A Satins must be dressed but lustrings we do not dress Mr Spooner sent them to the dresser I intended to have the satins dressed after they were sold these were undressed when stolen COURT Q When did you lose them A On the 15th of August and found them on the Thursday following the 23rd some of them had been dressed in the intermediate time GEORGE THOMAS EDWARDS On Thursday evening the 15th of July I was in the warehouse and left it about half-past seven o clock it was secured by a lock and a bar across the door and fastened by a padlock I found itbroken the following day - these very goods were on the premises that evening I know them to be the same I can identify them positively we have had them too long on the counter not to know them I believe if there were a thousand pieces of the same patterns I could pick them out they have been constantly under my eye and they are the make of several different manufacturers and we after taking stock mixed the several manufacturers goods together and these are the same assortment of goods as we had made Cross-examined Q Are you a partner A No he has no partner it is Thomas Dodd s warehouse the goods were his and in his warehouse - Bullock is only the agent he is not answerable for them they are consigned to him for sale without his being responsible - I know Mr Dodd has no partner they are all Dodd s goods THOMAS MARSHALL I live with Mr Spooner at No 85 Chiswell-street I bought five half-pieces of satin figured lustring ribbon of Lander - Bullock afterwards claimed them Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q How much did you give him for them A 17s I had seen him several times before he is a linen-draper and dealt in ribbons - I have seen some goods as good as those at 19s 6d a piece at wholesale houses in the city I gave 17s - I will not swear these are not worth 29s I should not like to give that for them - I should think Lander was a judge of these articles WILLIAM MAY LANDER I live at 149 Upper Whitecross-street The prisoner came to my house in the afternoon of the 20th of August and said he wished to speak to me - my young man called me down to him and he said he had some goods would I step home and look at them - I had bought of him before in that manner - I went down in the evening he keeps a clothes-shop in Golden-lane he took some papers off his shelves and produced some ribbons I said It is too late in the season for them he said we could not get jobs unless the season was gone by he named the price at 18s a piece - I said Where did you get them he said I bought them of a very respectable man - I offered him 16s a piece and he said I should have them - I bought thirty-four pieces - I paid him 27l 4s in gold and silver they were not worth more - in the proper season some would not be worth more and others would some patterns would not sell at all - some of them were worth considerably more - they were not worth 18s - I conceive I gave a fair price Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q What are you A A haberdasher I have lived in Upper Whitecross-street three years and a half I have dealt with the prisoner for the last six months occasionally three or four times for different sort of things in our way - I have bought ribbon and haberdashery I bought some trimmings of him about a month ago and some ribbons about six weeks ago that was not so large a parcel as these - I have bought goods three or four times or six- I did not take an invoice of the goods I bought - I marked it down myself on a piece of paper which came from the ribbons - I have not got that paper - that is the way I deal I take no invoice when I pay money - I have dealt with many people buying goods and not had an invoice - I knew him to be a very respectable man - I was in trouble about this on the following Thursday which was two days after - I told our young men in the shop who I bought them of when I brought them home there was a gentleman in the house when I was called down to the prisoner - I have two shopmen one is here there was nothing in the goods to make me think them improperly come by - it is very general to buy different patterns at so much a piece altogether - nobody but Mrs Benjamin was present when I bought them - I did not know what I was going to look at when I went to his house - I went home for the money and then came back with it - I brought the goods from his house myself in a paper parcel JURY Q Is it customary to buy goods and not take an acknowledgment or discharge from the party A I believe it is quite general if I go to a house and see a lot of goods I bring them away - it is generally the case with job lots HENRY BUCKLAND I am shopman to Mr Lander I recollect the prisoner coming to my master s shop on Tuesday - he asked if Mr Lander was at home I said Yes and went for him when he came down stairs he said he had something to sell him - Lander said he would come down in the evening he went and returned with a quantity of ribbons Cross-examined Q Did you hear all that passed A No I heard the prisoner say he had something to sell him in the shop - my master went out and when he came home next he had the ribbons with him - I saw him return and he had the ribbons - I was at home all the afternoon he was gone about half an hour he lives about half a mile from the prisoner s house - it would take him half an hour to go there to examine the goods and bring them to the house - I cannot say whether you can go twice in half an hour - I don t know whether he was half an hour or three quarters - I should think it would take him the time he was gone - I was in the shop- there is a private door my master goes in at that door very seldom - I was in the shop all the time - I don t know whether I was or not - I might have been out part of the time except going out for a necessary purpose I was in the shop - I might have gone out into the yard and if I did I was not out three minutes - I never saw master return till he came back with the ribbons JOHN ROE I am an officer I produce the goods - I got one parcel of twenty-four pieces from Spooner and another parcel of forty-five pieces from Lander - I searched the prisoner s premises but found no ribbons nothing but clothes Cross-examined Q When you searched the premises was he at home A He was he certainly told me I might search his house all over - I found nothing of a suspicious nature - I found no silk goods at all there THOMAS BULLOCK These are the goods I lost I am certain of it Prisoner I am totally innocent I never dealt in such articles - I have been eighteen years in the clothes line and know nothing at all about them I never had a thing of the kind THOMAS BULLOCK re-examined I know them from theappearance and the condition they are in - I am confident of all the patterns JURY Q Might not you find these patterns at Leaf s or Morrison s A I think not not mixed up as these are - it is usual to keep goods separate not to mix four or five manufacturers goods of different prices together as these are - I put them together and averaged them in stock at 23s a piece - some have been dressed since they were stolen - the trade never send them out till they are dressed JURY to WILLIAM MAY LANDER Q You said you bought thirty-four pieces of ribbon of the prisoner A Yes the officer had the whole I had left JOHN ROE There are forty-five rolls but I understand they are half-pieces which has caused the mistake WILLIAM MAY LANDER I have had the same sort of goods offered me before precisely the same patterns JURY Q Did anybody see the prisoner in the shop besides a young man A Yes both my young men COURT Q When you bought them of the prisoner was anybody present at his own place A Only his wife he sold them to me in the shop - I think there was a young man at the door when I went in they were sold in the front shop JURY to JOHN ROE Q Had you any conversation with the prisoner at the time you apprehended him A I took Lander to the prisoner s shop and asked him who he had bought the ribbons of he pointed to the prisoner - the prisoner said he had never sold him such things he never dealt in such things he always denied it GUILTY Aged 40 Transported for Fourteen Years

on the 12th of November our house was robbed and among other articles was lost from the first floor front room a pier looking-glass - I saw the frame of it afterwards - on the morning after the robbery my servant picked up a piece of carved leaf in the counting-house which had formed part of the looking-glass frame - I gave it to the policeman Campbell ROBERT PRICE I am a cabriolet-driver - on the morning of the 12th of November I was hired by one man in Tottenham-court-road and he ordered me to go into the New-road we went and had something to drink and while we waited in the New-road two or three men came to me and several things were brought and put into the cab- among other things they brought a looking-glass - where it came from I don t know - they ordered me to drive to Islington - when I got there they told me to go on and at last I went to the corner of Brewer-street in Rawstone-street and there two or three men came and took the things out of the cab and went down Brewer-street with them into a house a very few doors down the street - I don t exactly know whose house it was - it was near six o clock in the morning by the time I got there - I did not see the prisoner to know whether he was one of the men or not - it was very dark - I could not distinguish the men - I have given evidence against Coverdale and Foster before - Coverdale was the person who hired me and I believe Foster is the man who rode with me up to Brewer-street -

he said if he had known that he would have gone out the back way and I should have had a chase after him JOHN ANTHONY STRINGER I know the prisoner - I remember his bringing me a looking-glass for sale - I do not remember the day of the week it might be six weeks ago from the present time - I did not pay any particular attention to the time - I bought the glass - I gave him 1l 18s for it - I took it out of the frame and put it into a chimney frame and sold it - I have part of the frame at home and part of it is here - I gave it to the officers Campbell and Duke - they were parts of the frame of the looking-glass the prisoner sold me I am positive - my wife was present Prisoner Q Did you not say it was ten weeks ago that I sold it to you A I cannot positively say the time - I said it might be six weeks ago since I bought it of you when you came to my shop ANN STRINGER I am the wife of John Anthony Stringer - I was present when he bought a looking-glass of the prisoner - it is as near six weeks ago as possible - I think it may be seven weeks from this time - I was examined before the magistrate a fortnight ago last Tuesday - it was about six weeks before that - he gave thirty-eight shillings for it -

I am sure this formed part of my looking-glass-frame - they have been fixed to the place at home where the glass had been fixed and I know them by a mark here and the leaf fits one of the pillars Prisoner Q Are there no frames like that A I cannot swear that - this mark was caused by a liquor-frame being placed against it Prisoner s Defence If that is Mr Keyser s it was sold to Stringer before the robbery which you will find by Stringer s evidence - I did not know till one o clock I should be tried before next week - last session I was admitted here as evidence against the men who did the robbery - if I had anything to have done with the frame depend on it I certainly should have mentioned it - I was taken up for the robbery myself and admitted as evidence at Hatton Garden- If I had known about the glass I certainly should have spoken about it GUILTY Aged 29 -

I asked him if he was a porter belonging to the Norwich Magnet - he said Yes - I said Do you recollect my delivering a parcel to you - he said No - I said Never mind walk to the Mansion-house with me and we will talk about it when we got there I asked him where he lived - and he said he rented two rooms on the first-floor at No 2 Duke-street Blackfriars - I went there with Phipps and the prosecutor - the prisoner s wife was not at home when we first went but she came in afterwards with the shawl on her shoulder - I found this gown-piece in a box in the back-room - I found forty sovereigns in a box and a purse with some duplicates in it Cross-examined Q When you took him he told you you would find his wife there and gave you his address A Yes - I do not know that the woman was his wife - Duke-street is the third or fourth turning down Stamford-street COURT Q Did you say anything to the prisoner after having seen the woman A No - one of the duplicates I found had the name of Polden on it CHARLES JAMES BEETSON I am clerk in the teller s office in the Bank of England - on the 27th of January about half-past 9 o clock ten £10 notes were brought in - the numbers of them are not entered in this book which I keep - I only enter the amount and the person s name and write on one of the notes - they were paid to the name of Jones and the note marked is No 19 547 - it was not the prisoner who brought them - about one o clock the same day a man named Warner brought several £5 notes one of which I marked it is No 39 281 - he asked for sovereigns for them and I paid him eighty sovereigns WILLIAM WARNER I am a porter and stand at the Saracen s-head Aldgate - on Monday the 27th of January I was there and the prisoner came up to me he asked if there was a ticket-porter there - I said there was not but asked if it was anything I could do - he said he had some notes he wanted changed at the Bank for gold- I told him if he mistrusted me he might inquire my character anywhere as I had been on the ground sixteen years - he said Well come with me I am going to the East India Arms Chop-house in Fenchurch-street to have a mutton-chop - I went with him he asked the waiter if he knew anything of me - the waiter said he did not - the prisoner said he had some notes he wanted changed for gold - the waiter said he dare say it was all right and the prisoner counted sixteen £5 notes in his presence but I cannot tell the numbers - I am no scholar - I took the sixteen notes and got eighty sovereigns for them at the Bank - he gave me this bit of paper with an address on it which I was to put upon the notes - it is Mr W Thompson Ospringe Kent - I went to the Bank and as I could not write I asked a gentleman there to put my name on one of them which he did - I delivered them to the clerk he gave them back to me and Mr Beetson gave me the money - I was going back and when I got to the East India House I asked one of the porters what the address on the note the prisoner gave me was a man tapped me on the shoulder and he went with me to the East India Chophouse - I do not know who he was - when I got there the prisoner was not there and the man who went with me said Sit down he will be here in a minute - the prisoner came in about two minutes - I gave him the money hecounted it said it was all right and gave me half-a-crown- I am quite sure it was the prisoner MR BEETSON I believe this is the man I paid the eighty sovereigns to EDWARD ALLEN I was waiter at the East India Chophouse - what Warner states is correct - I am sure the prisoner is the man RICHARD CLEMENTS I am coachman of the Chester mail - I only know that there was no such parcel in the coach when we got to Tamworth - nor was there at Hinckley where we breakfast - it was on the way-bill but not in the coach MR SCRimgEOUR I lost £208 in all Mr Greenhill a musical instrument maker William Calendar Alexander Glass a baker and Mr Robertson a coach proprietor gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 28 -

he keeps pheasants and some of them are silver ones - I have the care of them - I missed two silver pheasants on the morning of the 30th of January which I had seen safe at eight o clock the night before in the pleasure-ground in front of the house - they were tame birds and would feed out of my hand - I came to London on the 1st of February and saw the two pheasants at the office - I could swear they are my master s - these are them - this young one I brought up and the other I had an accident with and broke its pinion RICHARD STACEY I drive the Bristol Mail - on the night of the 29th of January I was stopped by a person at Salt-hill about five miles from Hatcherley-park - he gave a bag to the guard and said he must take care of it as there were a couple of live pheasants in it and I understood him to say they were going to the Post-office but the direction is near the Post-office - when we came a little nearer town another man gave me a basket which he said contained pork and it was to go near the New Post-office - when I came to Lad-lane I looked at the two directions and they were both alike For Mr Brown to be left at the Nottingham Castle near the New Post-office London - the bag was opened and it contained two live pheasants and the basket nineteen fowls which were not picked and some of them were warm - I packed them up again and sent them by a porter as directed and I and an officer went and watched them - the prisoner came and had them and was taken WILLIAM FOWLER I am a porter - I took the bag and basket to the Nottingham Castle Angel-street JOHN HEAPS I am landlord of the Nottingham Castle- the bag and basket were brought to my house - the porter demanded four shillings for the carriage which I paid - the prisoner afterwards came and asked if there was anything left in the name of Brown - I said Yes and I had paid four shillings carriage -

he said Two birds - I looked in and saw these two pheasants - he said he was to take them to the Ship in Ivy-lane Newgate-street and he was to meet a person there - I took him back to the Nottingham Castle where I found the basket of fowls - I found the tickets of the carriage and the direction which had been on the pheasants in his pocket Prisoner s Defence written About three weeks ago a man came to me about six o clock on a Thursday morning who had the appearance of a salesman and whom I had often seen waiting near the Post-office and who was sometimes attended with a market-porter till the mail-coaches came in when he takes some baskets from the coaches and proceeds up Newgate-street with them - he said he might give me a job now and then for he said he had a horse and cart standing in Newgate-street and that he had business in the market which prevented him from always waiting till the coaches came in - he then told me that whenever any of his baskets should come and he not be there there would be a direction on them for Mr Brown to be left at the Nottingham Castle till called for but that I was to take them to the Ship public-house where I should see him and if there should be any live birds at any time I was to get a flat and put them in so that they should not be hurt - he told me that he had sent an order into thecountry and he expected some five birds on the abovenamed day that I was to bring them to him and he would give me sixpence for my trouble - accordingly there was a basket and a bag came by the Bristol coach about nine o clock directed as above - the bag contained two live birds which I took from the bag and put into a basket as I had been directed but I did not know what was in the basket - I left the basket at the public-house and was taking the live birds to the Ship when I was stopped in Butcher-hall-lane by the officer and two more men who asked me if I had not another basket - I told him yes but I had left it at the public-house as I could not bring them both at once being so heavy - they then took me back to the public-house when I told them if they would go with me to the Ship they would see the man which they refused GUILTY Aged 59 -

I superintended the delivery of eight bales of wool to Galley Quay - the steamer was close against the Custom-house - five of the bales were marked with a triangle and three circles and the other three with a plain triangle - they were landed between three and four o clock in the afternoon HARLOE TRUMBLE I had charge of the Belfast in her progress down the river - I delivered the eight bales at Galley Quay on the 11th of February - they were marked and numbered - five of them had a triangle and three circles on them and were numbered 203 204 206 207 and 208- the other three had a plain triangle and were numbered 300 301 and 302 WILLIAM DEBNAM I am landing foreman On the 11th of February I was at Galley Quay when the eight bales were landed about half-past three o clock - I left at five o clock and went again the next morning at nine o clock - I was not then aware that any of the bales were missing - at ten o clock the landing officer came to weigh them and about twelve o clock one of the bales was missing - it was one of the eight which had the previous afternoon been landed from the Belfast and had the triangle and the circles on it - the bales were about seven feet long Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Have you the amount of the weight A No I put them into the scale and the Crown weighs them - there were twenty-two bales all together on the Quay when I left at five o clock the day before - I did not count them that morning - I had not taken the numbers of them WILLIAM PIPER TOMLINS I am landing-waiter at the Custom-house On Tuesday the 11th of February I counted some bales of wool which were at the Custom-house - there were twenty-two in all and I believe fifteen had been landed that day from the Belfast - they were all safe five minutes before four o clock Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q I suppose you are not certain as you say I believe A I am positive there were twenty-two all together WILLIAM JOYCE I am a Custom-house officer - I was on duty at Galley Quay - I left at four o clock - there were twenty-two bales there and fourteen had been landed that day from the Belfast - I returned to the Quay at eight o clock the next morning and between twelve and one o clock one bale was missed Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q There were fourteen landed from the Belfast were there A Yes JAMES ATWOOD I am a night watchman at the King s warehouse at the Custom-house - I went on duty at Galley Quay at four o clock on the 11th of February - Joyce was there - he delivered to my charge the bales of wool - he gave me a note stating there were twenty-two bales - I did not count them - I went off duty at half-past twelve o clock - I then left them in charge of John Warren - I had not the least reason to believe that any of them had been removed when I left - it was high water the next morning about five o clock - there is a great depth from the Quay to the water at low water Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q I suppose it was impossible to steal one of the bales while you were there as you were put there to take care of them A Yes I took strict care of them - I did not fall asleep JOHN WARREN I am a watchman at Galley Quay - I went on duty at half-past twelve o clock in the morning of the 12th of February and remained till nine o clock - during the time I was there I had no reason to believe that any of the bales were stolen - the removal of one of them into a boat at high water would not make much noise - it was high water at a quarter before five o clock - a boat could come close along side the quay at high water and a bale would not have above a couple of feet to drop into a oat from the quay Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Would it not take some trouble to drop a bale into a boat A No - I was there for the purpose of watching but I had severalarticles to watch - these bales were standing on end - there was another watchman with me - I don t know how long he had been there as that was my first day - the bales were about nine feet long - two of the bags which are here are not so large as one of the bales - one man would not be able to roll one of them but when a bale of wool was thrown down it would project from the edge of the quay two or three feet over the water - I suppose the wharf is fifty feet long - I did not go to sleep JURY Q What width is the quay A From thirty to forty feet - the bale of wool stood within six feet of the water MR ADOLPHUS Q Then if one were thrown down and some part of it projected over the water would it be easy for a man in a boat to draw it into a boat with a hook A Yes very easy - I was walking about the wharf- the place where these bales stood was in total darkness and quite absconded from seeing anybody while we were walking on the other part of the wharf WILLIAM MALLANDINE I was with the last watchman on duty at the quay - I came on at eight o clock in the evening and stayed till eight o clock in the morning - I did not see any bale taken Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Whose watchman are you A Robert Smith s - I had to mind the bales of wool and other things - it is a small wharf - we walked about together - we sometimes had our backs turned on the goods - it is an easy thing to hook off a bale of wool - I did not see anybody come to hook off a bale MR BODKIN Q Did you see any bale carried out through the gates that night A No they were all fast WILLIAM PARR On the morning of the 12th of February I was attending the Lock at Lee Cut Limehouse which communicates with the Thames and I should think is a mile and a quarter from Galley Quay - about half-past seven o clock that morning a boat arrived and a young man was in it - there was a bag in it made of coarse stuff such as they put hops in - I think it was rougher than these bags are - it appeared about five feet in length and about three feet and a half wide - I spoke to the man and he to me and he went up the river towards Limehouse - it was a lug-boat - I saw some pieces of wool about the bag - I noticed the words Legal Quay on the boat - it came back about half-past six o clock in the evening and was then empty Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q I suppose you took particular notice of the bag A Not particular notice - it was about six feet long a thing they carry hops in - I was about four feet from the boat - the bag could not have been nine feet long - it was a rougher covering than this - it was a different kind of material to these covers - it appeared to be stowed close - it filled the boat almost - if it had dropped into the boat it must have made a splash - there might have been something in the boat to prevent its making a noise - it was a small lug-boat - the bag was not up to the top of the boat - it was about the middle - I did not know the man - it was on Ash Wednesday morning and was very wet - it rained when he came in - it was a narrow boat about ten feet long perhaps and would carry about four ton - there was no concealment about this JOHN WELLS My father is a carman and lives near the London Hospital On the morning of the 12th of February between seven and eight o clock a man came and hired a van - I went with him down to the Stinkhouse-bridge near Bow Common that is the river Lee - I received a bag of wool out of a boat - I do not know whether it was a lug-boat - I took it to Mr Bell s house the prisoner it is up in Old-street and down by some church - I do not know the name of the street - I arrived there a little after nine o clock - I saw the prisoner there - he did not say any thing to me but helped us with the bale into the house - the prisoner was in his shirt sleeves - the bale was between eight and nine feet long - I saw something appearing through it which appeared to be wool or flock - I thought it was wool Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Who was with you A The person who came and hired me - I should know the man if I saw him - it was in the same sort of case as these bags here but it was more packed and neater than these are WILLIAM PARR re-examined Q What time did you go on the lock that morning A At two o clock and I stayed till eight o clock - I do not think there was any other boat went up - there were barges WILLIAM KEMP I am clerk to Messrs Pickford wharfingers in the City Road On the 12th of February three small bags of wool were brought to our wharf about ten minutes past one o clock two came on a truck first and one came afterwards - the prisoner Mr Bell came with the last and another person with him - the prisoner wished me to weigh the bags for him which I did which is not usual to do when the freight is not paid - but we do it as a favour - they weighed 5cwt and 6lbs - I saw they contained wool and I saw it was not British wool - I saw it through a place which was not sewn up - the bags were not of equal size - I see bales of wool every day - these bags were not packed up as bags of wool are usually packed - they were not sewn as if by a wool-packer - Mr Bell asked me to let them remain till the next day and he then came and gave me the consignment - three small bags of wool for Mr Joseph Dufton Leeds from Mr Lufton John Bell - these are the bags which were sent off Cross-examined Q Did you know the prisoner before A Yes I had seen him several times in the way of business - I saw no concealment about him - any one could see the wool in these bags they were not finished sewing - I had not received any wool of Mr Bell before - I had received strips of cloth and gun cases MR ADOLPHUS Q Have you his residence in your book A Yes John Bell of Old-street - I asked him his address and he gave me this which is our general way JAMES SKILLMAN I am a porter at Messrs Pickford s wharf I saw the prisoner there on Wednesday the 12th of February when these bags were brought on a truck - there was a hole in one of the bags and I saw wool in it- the hole was sewed up by Mr Bell s desire - I saw him again the next day - he asked me if they could lay there three or four days or a week or if there was a boat going that we could send them off directly - he followed me down the stairs and I asked the porter who was shipping at the scale if he was shipping any thing for Leeds - he said the boat for Leeds was not in but he would call it in and he did and shipped the three bags in it - at Mr Bell s request I marked the bags Nos 1 2 and 3 and a D with L under it and they were consigned to Mr Dufton of Leeds - they were shipped on board the Conqueror Captain James Simpson - they appeared to me to be like one bag cut into three parts and they were packed clumsily Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did they appear to be like one rough bag cut into three smooth ones A No they were different qualities of case - they appeared to be one cut into three - I did not see the consignment - Mr Bell said to me if I would ship them directly he would give me 1s MR ADOLPHUS Q You have said the bags had the appearance of different qualities cut out of one bag A It is different qualities some of it is like sacking and some like the regular bags Q Will you tell us what you mean by one bag cut into three A It appears that the wool has been taken out and sewed up in separate bags - bags of wool are of a certain weight but I do not weigh them WILLIAM BREED I am porter at the shipping scale at Pickford s wharf - I remember these three bags of wool being weighed to be shipped to Leeds - they weighed as follows - No 1 - 1 cwt 2 qrs 14 lbs - No 2 - 1 cwt 3 qrs 7 lbs - No 3 - 1 cwt 2 qrs 4 lbs Total - 4 cwt 3 qrs 25 lbs or 557 lbs I have been in the habit of weighing bags of wool they are all weights from 1 cwt to 8 cwt JAMES SIMPSON I am a boatman in Messrs Pickford s employ - my boat is the Conqueror On some day in February I took these three bags of wool from their wharf to Leeds - I got as far as Huddersfield when it was stopped by the officer - it had not been out of my possession THOMAS RAYSON I am clerk to Mr Robert John Smith and Mr Duff - they are the proprietors of Galley-quay and take in goods as wharfingers - I remember eight bales of wool being taken in on the 11th of February and on the next day between three and four o clock I heard that one was missing - I examined the bales which were left and one was missing - I do not know the number of it but it had a triangle on it with a circle at each corner - I went with Lee the officer to Mr Bell s house No 16 Provost-street City-road - that street does not lead directly into Old-street - we went about six o clock in the evening of Thursday - the prisoner was not at home - we waited about a quarter of an hour - the prisoner came in and either the officer or I asked him if he had had a bale of wool yesterday - he said he had not and he asked Lee by what authority we were in his house and if he had a warrant - he said he had been an officer himself and his house ought not to be searched without some authority - Lee then showed his staff of office and put several questions to him - I stated that I had lost a bale of wool - he asked if I was the prosecutor - I said I represented the prosecutors or the proprietors I do not know which but I think it was proprietors - the prisoner said he did not know it was stolen - I asked him from whom he bought it but he did not make any answer to that - I asked him whether he paid for it by a cheque or by cash - he said he paid for it by a £50 note and received a shilling back - he said he had no invoice and had not entered it in his book - I asked him if he weighed it and he said he had and it weighed 549lbs - I said You seem to have a specific weight where did you weigh it I do not see any scales - he did not answer that question - I asked him where the bale of wool was - he did not answer - I then asked him if he had sold it - he said No - I then said As you can give no satisfactory account from whom you bought it or what you have done with it it will be my duty to give you into custody - he then said he would pay for the wool and pay the officer his expenses rather than be taken into custody - I said I could listen to no compromise if he had bought it fairly he could have no objection to state from whom he bought it - he then turned to Lee and said You know him I have not seen him before for six months - we had left Wells outside but after Mr Bell had refused all knowledge of the bale of wool we brought Wells in and confronted them - I said Do you know this gentleman boy - Wells said Yes that is the gentleman who helped me into the passage with the bale of wool yesterday - the prisoner then said Yes I did buy a bale of wool yesterday Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q It was after you told him that the bale of wool had been stolen that he said whatever wool he had bought he did not know had been stolen A Yes I said we came to inquire after a bale of wool that had been stolen but Lee said Have you bought a bag of German skin-wool - the subject of the mark was never mentioned - I should rather think that is not an ordinary kind of wool - there may be some in the market but no great quantity in proportion to the general quantity of wool but I do not examine the wool - we do not hear of German skin-wool in nine cases out of ten - there may be thousands of pounds of it in the market - I know nothing about the price of German skin-wool but Mr Bell said I have given 1s 10 1/2d for this I shall not get a half-penny a pound by it JAMES LEE I am an officer I was employed to go with Mr Rayson to the prisoner - Wells went with us - Mr Rayson went in first and I went in afterwards - when we had waited about ten minutes the prisoner came and knocked at the door - Mrs Bell opened it and said My dear there are some officers here about some wool - I was behind her - I asked him if his name was Bell - he said Yes - I said I wanted to speak to him - I then told him I called about a bale of wool that was brought to his house yesterday - he said by what authority did I come had I a warrant - I said No but I told him my name and what office I belonged to - I did not produce my staff - I then asked if he had received any wool - he said No - I asked him again and he repeated two or three times that he had not - I told him to be particular - I then called Wells in and said to him Do you know this person pointing to the prisoner - he said Yes that is the gentleman who assisted in taking in the bale of wool and putting it down in the passage - I said What do you say to that Mr Bell - he looked very earnestly at Wells and then said Yes I recollect that boy yesterday - he then said that he had bought a bale of wool - Mr Rayson then asked if he had an invoice of it - he said No - Iasked him repeatedly who he bought it of - he said he had not seen the person before for six months - I asked his name and where he lived but he would not give any answer - he said he would not answer any more questions without the advice of his solicitor as it might implicate himself - he then asked what was the matter about this wool - Mr Rayson said it had been stolen - the prisoner asked if it belonged to him - he said No he represented the person to whom it belonged - he said he did not wish anybody to lose any thing by him - that he bought it very dear and should not get a penny a pound by it and he would pay the value and pay the officer s expenses - Mr Rayson said he could not hold out any promise or undertake any thing of that kind - in going along in the coach Mr Bell said the wool had gone a long way into the country but he did not say where - after he was in custody I went on the Friday morning into the neighbourhood of his house and in consequence of information I went to Pickford s wharf and from thence to Huddersfield where I found this wool in a boat - I searched the prisoner s house the night I took him and there were several pieces of canvass which I took up and put on a chair till the morning - I then went again and they were gone but I found some sweepings of wool which I have here - I searched the prisoner to see if he had any documents of wool going away and he had not Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When did you go to search the prisoner A On the Friday at Clerkenwell prison to see if he had any papers relative to the wool which had been sent to Pickford s - that was all I went for- I did not go there to see what I could get out of him - I had no such intention - Mr Rayson and Mr Smith were with me - we were going to Pickford s in the early part of the morning and we called there first - I did not go to ask him any questions nor I do not believe the others did - there was some conversation between Mr Bell and Mr Smith - I did not put any question to him - I know my duty better than that - the reason I had not searched him before he was in prison was I had not discovered where the wool was - I did not ask him if there was any body in the neighbourhood to whom he could refer me - I did not ask him about Mr Marson - I heard Mr Marson s name mentioned but I do not recollect by whom - I went to Mr Marson in consequence of something I heard - I will swear I did not ask the prisoner where to find Mr Marson - I know nothing of Mr Marson - the prisoner did mention something about Mr Marson - he talked a great deal Q Do you recollect the words the prisoner made use of when he came to his home A I asked if his name was Bell - he said Yes - I then said I came about a bale of wool that had been brought to his house yesterday - I did not give him any other description of the article that was lost - I did not say German skin wool - if I had used such words I must have recollected it - I did not produce my staff - if Mr Rayson has sworn I did he must be mistaken - there was a great deal of confusion at the time with Mr Bell- I went to Mr Marson s but I think Mr Rayson went before I did - I made some inquiries in the neighbourhood JOSEPH MARSON I am a wool-broker and live in Basinghall-street I know the prisoner - I saw him on the 12th of February about one o clock - he came to me as I was in the White Hart Bell Alley taking dinner - he produced a small sample of German skin wool and wished me to purchase it - he asked 2s 2d a pound for it - I objected to that price - he then offered it at 2s 1d - I said I was not a buyer at all - he then asked if I would take it at 2s - I said the market was very flat and I would have nothing to do with it - I saw him again the next day and he said he had sent the wool off on speculation - he said he had about 5 cwt of it - I have seen the wool produced by the officer it was of a similar description to this Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Does wool change its colour A Not particularly - I have known the prisoner four or five years - there was no appearance of concealment in this matter - it is impossible to tell the price of German skin wool - it differs in every sample - when I saw this wool at Lambeth-street office I thought it worth 2s 6d a pound - it has now fallen considerably - I saw the sample the prisoner produced - I do not know that that was the same - 1s 10d was certainly a very reasonable price for what I saw - if I had wanted wool I should have had no objection to have bought of the prisoner JOHN BARNETT I am a clerk to Messrs John Cooper and Spratt We received nine bales of wool which had been conveyed from Hamburgh - we ought to have received 10 - this is the bill of lading - the Nos are No 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 seven of these were marked with a triangle and loops at the end and three with a plain triangle - we only received six with a triangle and loops to it - the number of the one missing was 207 - the weight of that was 535lbs Hamburgh weight but we generally add about 7 per cent to the Hamburgh weight which would be 35lbs more - here is a piece on one of these bags which seems to correspond with the wrapper of the following number - we received the bill of lading from Mr Forgess on the 11th of February with a desire that we should enter them and clear them from the Custom-house- I made an entry at the Custom-house and the wools were landed from the vessel - the endorsement on this bill is Mr Barr s - we expected ten bales and we received nine- if there should have been only landed at Galley Quay six with the triangles and circles and three with the triangles only that would be nine the exact number we received - if six and three were all that were landed that would be all we could receive WILLIAM AUSTIN FOSSETT I am a lighterman On the 11th of February I had a lug-boat moored at Galley Quay in the evening and on the following morning I missed it - I had given no permission to any one to take it away - she was afterwards found at Limehouse abandoned - she was a lug-boat of about twelve tons burden - she would hold a dozen bales of wool or more than that - my name was on it and the number and Galley Quay Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Were the words Legal quay on your boat A No MR BODKIN Q What were the words A William Fossett Galley Quay No 7 - Galley Quay is a legal quay - it is known as such JOHN CLEMENTS I am in the employ of Mr Fossett I went in search of his boat and found her a short distance from Limehouse-cut on the 13th of February MR BODKIN to JOHN BARNETT Q Do you know whether any other bales were landed for you the day afterwards A Yes I saw them landed - my evidence applied to the total number we received from the Belfast WILLIAM JOYCE re-examined Q How many bales from the Belfast were landed on the 11th A Five with the triangles and circles and some the day afterwards Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q What time on the next day were they landed A About one or two o clock- I did not see them taken away - there were two came the following day - I did state on my examination before that on the 11th of February only fourteen were landed MR ADOLPHUS Q Have you any notes A Yes these are them here is eight on one and seven on the other - I did not before swear there were only fourteen JOSEPH DUFTON I am a woollen-manufacturer at Leeds I did not expect any wool from the prisoner on the 11th of February - I had no advice of it Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you know Mr Lupton A Yes I should have taken wool from him at any time if it suited me MR ADOLPHUS Q Should you have expected some advice A Yes and I had no advice of any at that time COURT Q Do you receive from some of your correspondents goods without advice A No I never did in my life from anybody without I had some advice of them - I did not receive two bags within a week of the time these were sent without any advice - I have not received any thing from Mr Lupton this year - I think I did in December - he sent the wool down and it laid there a week - he then sent me advice that if I liked it at a certain price I might keep it Abraham Riddiford woollen-draper Basinghall-street James Chamberlain Ball s-pond Mark Hagar slopseller Bath-street St Luke s Jeremiah Ramplin coffee-house keeper Shoreditch James Jiggers a draper Newcastle-street Strand James James tailor Provost-street City-road Joseph Ladbroke woollen-draper No 60 Wood-street Cheapside Mrs Underwood Lydia Anderson Suffolk-street Cornwall-road Susan Rumball Radnor-street William Nash furrier Southwark-bridge Hannah Hall Aldersgate-street and Maria Ward Eagle Inn Gravesend gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 53 -

of braces value 3l 10s the goods of John Wheatly Liggins and 3 yards of embroidered velvet value 12s the goods of Thomas Bousfield well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute JOHN WHEATLY LIGGINS I have a warehouse at No 75 Wood-street Cheapside I left town on Saturday evening at eleven o clock and returned on the Monday morning as I had received information that my place had been robbed—on the Friday following Roe and Vann the officers went with me to the prisoner Carey s place No 4 Turn again-lane—I went first to the room door and tapped with my finger—the passage is rather dark—the door was slightly opened and I could discover by a window behind me that a female was peeping through—Roe went with me to the door—it was closed and we burst it open—I found the two prisoners in the room and a female—and there was a bed on the floor—a large number of my purses and other things were found there—the appearance of the place indicated that the parties had been engaged in taking the papers off the purses and throwing them into the fire—they had been done up in small bundles and they had taken the papers off some of them and done them up in large bundles—there was burnt paper in the fireplace—and in a tea-cup in a shelf over the fire-place were some pins similar to those which had pinned up the bundles of purses—these three yards of embroidery were there—they belong to one of my people—these braces were found there—I cannot swear to them but I had some similar to them in boxes in my warehouse and I lost a number of them corresponding with the number we found—but these purses I can distinctly swear to—Broom said What shall I do Tom I merely came here to set up a bedstead —and Carey said Had you have been here sooner you would have found or seen the right parties Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You accused a person of the name of Stocks of stealing these articles A I did not—I was out of town when he was accused—he was committed at Guildhall because he prevaricated—I went before the Grand Jury on a bill which was ignored—Stocks and Broom was committed as thieves or on suspicion Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You have stated something that Carey said—have you stated the whole A I think I have—I do not recollect his saying that if we had been a few minutes sooner we should have been able to take the men who brought them there in his absence and gave them to his wife—I will not swear he did not say so THOMAS BOUSFIELD I am warehouseman to the prosecutor I shut up his warehouse at a quarter past seven o clock that night—the door has a spring lock to it—I did not try the door that night as I generally do and cannot positively say that it was fastened—the property was all safe then—I left Stocks there BENJAMIN HAYDEN I live at No 9 Waterloo-terrace King s-road Chelsea I was at a coffee-house in Wood-street that evening and Stocks came in and Westall with him—Stocks went out once or twice but not for more than a minute or so—Stocks then asked me to go over the way to the French Horn with them which I did—I then asked Stocks if he would let me sleep with him—he said yes—I took a light over in my hand and it went out—the other young man then got a light and we found that the warehouse was broken open —STOCKS I went away from the warehouse at a quarter past seven o clock with Bousfield—I shut the door and went away—I returned a quarter before one o clock—the street door was fastened as I had left it but the warehouse door which I went out at was open—it appeared to have been broken open and this property was gone Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Are you the person who was accused of stealing the property A Yes and Bousfield also WILLIAM HENMAN I am an officer of Cripplegate I was called by Stocks and examined the premises—I found the desk broken open the cash-box broken open and some property missing—I know nothing of these prisoners JOHN ROE I am an officer I went to No 4 Turnagain-lane on the 17th of October with a search-warrant about one o clock in the day—I observed a door open—I immediately went to it and put my foot between the door and the post—there was a little resistance made but we got into the place—when—we got in I saw the two prisoners and Carey s wife—these purses were on the table and on a bed which was on the floor—Broom said Oh dear what shall I do Tom —I merely came to put up your bedstead—what a mess I am in —I think the prosecutor had before then said Here is my property —the woman who was there stated before the magistrate that she was Carey s wife and she was discharged—Carey said if we had been an hour sooner we should have had the right party—I had been watching the house for about four hours that day and had observed three men go in and come out and one of them I knew—he was Broom s father Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q I believe you know it was on suspicion of stealing that Broom was taken A Yes he does not live in that house—I know he assisted Carey in removing the night before from Coppice-row for I watched them Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You have stated a part of what Carey said—was his wife present A Not all the time—she was in the front room with me—I do not recollect that her husband remonstrated with her for having suffered these things to be brought in whilst he was away—she stated that the persons who brought them were a tall man and a short one when I asked her who brought them GEORGE NICHOLLS I let the three lower rooms in that house to Carey on the 16th of October—they had been empty about a month—his wife and a young man were with him—I cannot say who it was—I think the furniture came about four o clock in the afternoon—I do not live on the premises COURT to JOHN ROE Q Did you see any tools there A I did not there might have been some Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q About what time in the morning was it you saw those persons go into the house A They came at different times between ten and twelve Witnesses for Defence JOSEPH BAKEWELL I live in Union-street Bishopsgate and am a plumber s labourer I work for my brother who is a master plumber in Portpool-lane—I know the prisoner Carey and his brother—on the morning of the 17th of October I was at the corner of King s-road Gray sinn-lane—I saw Carey and his brother about eleven o clock or it might be earlier—Carey said he wanted my brother to put some squares of glass into this house in Turnagain-lane where he said he had taken a chandler s shop—we drank together and I parted with him about a quarter past twelve o clock COURT Q You say it was about eleven when you saw him A Yes or a quarter before—we had a pot of porter between the three of us— I do not know the sign of the public-house we had it at—it is at the corner of the Kings -road—there were some men sitting there and the servant who brought in the beer—we left about twelve—we had nothing to eat—we sat on a stool by the side of the fire—I do not recollect on which side but it was not in front—we came out together and I left Carey at the corner telling him my brother should be sure to be there by one o clock—I went away by myself and those two went away together—I do not know how far MR CLARKSON Q How far is Tnrnagain-lane from there A You might walk it in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—Carney and his brother were together when I met them and Carey crossed over to me in King s-road RICHARD CAREY I am brother of the prisoner I am a shoemaker and live at No 9 Macclesfield-place Pickford s Wharf City-road—I was with my brother on the morning of the 17th of October in King s-road Gray s-inn-lane—I had been with my brother about twenty minutes when we met this witness—I do not know his name—my brother and I had been to Back Hill—I had no watch but it was past eleven when I left home and about twenty minutes after I saw my brother we met this witness—we went to a public-house at the corner of the King s-road—I do not know the sign—there is a coach-stand opposite—we had a pot of porter and stayed there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—when we left my brother and I went away separately—we all three parted together—the witness must have known that I went away as I said I must go—my brother said something about some squares of glass and he said he was going home—a person could walk from Turnagain-lane to that public-house in ten minutes—I cannot tell whether my brother had been at home that morning before I net him on Back Hill—he said he was going on business COURT Q How long were you in the public-house A cannot say—I think a quarter of an hour was as much as it was because I was anxious to get to Holborn—we had one pot of porter—we sat on a stool or boards fixed to the boxes—we sat just round by the door not in front of the fire COURT to JOHN ROE Q You have seen these goods could a man have carried all those without your noticing them A I should say it was impossible even for three men to do it Carey s Defence On the 16th of October I took the shop parlour and kitchen there for the express purpose of making a chandler s shop—it was not my intention to have gone in that afternoon but I was obliged to leave my other lodging—I went home about ten at night and went to bed—I had two bedsteads and one of them was not put up—the shop was partly fitted up—I got up about nine in the morning and called on Broom—I asked him if he could come and put up my bedstead as he had helped me to move the day before from Coppice-row—he said Yes —I then went home and had my breakfast—I went out and met this plumber and told him to tell his brother to come down at one o clock—I then went home and as soon as I went in at the door I exclaimed to my wife Good God Elizabeth what have you been doing —she said two men came in and asked if they might sort some property which they had bought as they lived a long way off—that she said No —they said If your husband were at home he would consent —she then agreed to it—I had some words with heir—I said You have got no dinner ready —she said How could I when these men have been here —Broom then came in and I said to him Go get some bread and cheese and beer which we were having when the officer came—there was no resistance except the bedstead which might have made some small obstruction to opening the door as the prosecutor acknowledged—I said to them If you had been here an hour before you would have had the right parties —my wife stated that one was a tall man and one short—she said the same to the officer and Broom told the same story before the magistrate COURT to MR LIGGINS Q Did you state that the bed might have been some obstruction to opening the door A I think it might partly so Ellis Henry West a slater Irongate wharf Matthew Lewis Portpool-lane a shoemaker John Minshull Gray s-inn-lane shoemaker John Hicks Gilbert-street Grosvenor-square Charles M Carthy of Essex-street cab-proprietor and William Brown Portpool-lane shoemaker gave Carey a good character CAREY— GUILTY — Transported for Fourteen Years BROOM— NOT GUILTY 
t18350202-504  504 JOHN SELWOOD was indicted for feloniously receiving on the 5th of January of an evil-disposed person 1 silver basin value 5l and 1 silver tea-caddy value 3l the goods of John Blagrave Esq well knowing them to have been feloniously stolen MR PHILLIPS conducted the Prosecution COLONEL JOHN BLAGRAVE I live near Reading in Berkshire fortytwo miles from town On the 5th of January 1834 my house was broken open and robbed of a considerable property—it was a regular burglary—I lost plate and several other articles—I lost a sugar-basin and silver tea-caddy which I have since seen—after the robbery I circulated an account of it and offered a reward of 50l —I paid about 15l for the sugar-basin Cross-examined by MR ROE Q Are you at all acquainted with the prisoner A No I do not think I ever saw him before—he does not live in our parish from what I could find—I have made search but cannot find that he does—he gave hit name and address—I went there but could hear nothing of him CHARLES PERPEMENT I am shopman to Makepeace and Co of Searl-street Lincoln s-inn-fields This sugar-basin is of considerable value and the tea-caddy also—they were both made by us for the prosecutor JOHN TROY I am shopman to Mr Whiteaves a silversmith in Fleet-street On the 26th of March 1834 the prisoner came to master s house and brought this silver sugar-basin and tea-caddy with a silver inkstand a folding eye-glass and some silver coin—the whole weighed 60 ounces 2 pennyweights which I bought of him—we put it in our window—I afterwards saw the sugar-basin and caddy in possession of the last witness—it is a remarkable sugar-basin—I never saw one like it before—I am certain it is the sugar-basin the prisoner sold us—he said he lived near Newbury in Berks—I never knew him live in London—I knew him before—when he came in he said How do you do Here are a few articles I have to sell which the persons in the country are necessitated to sell in consequence of the badness of the times —in consequence of his saying that and having bought some articles before of him I did not suspect him—he did not mention who the country people were—I gave him 5s an ounce for it as old silver—he came again on the 6th of January to sell another quantity of plate and we detained him on account of having had information from Makepeace—we told him we should give him into custody in consequence of our buying plate of him stolen from Colonel Blagrave—his answer was I am not the thief —I said we detained him to clear our own character as there was some imputation cast on the character of the house—I said I hope you will be able to clear your character —he hesitated a good deal and I said But you say nothing —he replied I have enough to do to think —we took Colonel Blagrave s arms off the plate Q Did you ask the prisoner how the people who were necessitated to sell the sugar-basin happened to have arms A No it did not strike me as odd—there was the crest on one side and the arms on the other—it is usual to take the arms out—I thought he might be an honest man and he might be sent up to sell them—he did not say they were poor people—he said people were very much distressed and were obliged to sell it—I cannot tell what quantity of plate he brought the second time—it is in the officer s hands—I weighed the pencil-case—it was 3 ounces—there was a silver tea-pot and stand a sauce-ladle and table and tea-spoons—I did not weigh them—there was not time Cross-examined Q How long have you been in this shop A I have been servant there twenty-two years—it is a very well known shop for the sale of plate and coin and old silver—we frequently get old family plate from families and take off the arms to make it saleable—we knew the prisoner before and thought him an honest man—we dealt with him more than once—I had no suspicion till we heard of the robbery—he did not come to the shop again for nine months—I had no suspicion or I would not have bought them—the basin it rather a peculiar one—I never bought any article of the kind before—it is a peculiar make—5s an ounce is the usual price if it is not melted—if it is it is not above 4s 10d an ounce—I gave him a fair market price—we had promised to detain him the next time we saw him—Mr Whiteaves was present when he came again—he kept him in custody while I fetched the officer—it is common for things to be sold through agents—he was given in charge for the robbery of Colonel Blagrave—that was when the policeman was in the shop—I think Mr Whiteaves said I shall charge the policeman with you —I am not certain which of us said so—I think Mr Whiteaves said he should charge the police with him in consequence of the robbery at Colonel Blagrave s—that the plate we had bought of him was stolen—nothing was said about the robbery till the policeman came—it was about eleven o clock in the morning—he produced the things in the open shop—the inkstand and eye-glass have been claimed by Colonel Blagrave COURT Q You bought this without asking whose arms they were A Yes—it is rather a singular piece of plate—at 5s an ounce it would come to between 6l and 7l —we did not buy to melt but to sell—we gave a fair price for the whole of it COLONEL BLAGRAVE re-examined My arms are very conspicuous—my crest was on one side and the arms an the other—the articles produced are part of the property stolen on the might in question—the ink-stand was returned to me—I have not brought it here WILLIAM CUTTRESS I am a policeman I took the prisoner into custody WILLIAM PAYNE I am clerk to the magistrate at Guildhall I attended the prisoner s examination and remember his being called on for his defence—what he said was taken down in writing and read over to him—no threat or inducement was held out to him—I took down his defence—this paper contains it— reads — The prisoner says he lives at Crooks Easton Hampshire—he bought the two articles of a man and woman between Newbury and Hungerford about fourteen miles from Reading about fourteen days before he offered them for sale COLONEL BLAGRAVE Newbury is seventeen miles from Reading—Hampshire comes up two or three miles from Newbury Prisoner s Defence I can only say I bought it and did not know it was stolen GUILTY Aged 66 — Transported for Fourteen Years There was another indictment against the prisoner for receiving other property 
t18350202-559  559 ELIZABETH HICKMAN and WILLIAM HICKMAN the younger were indicted for receiving of a certain evil-disposed person on the 10th of December 1 copper value 15s the goods of Henry Cressweller they well knowing it to have been stolen &c against the Statute &c JOHN PEATON I am shopman to Mr Henry Cresweller—he carries on business at No 2 High-street St Marylebone—on the 10th of December I missed this copper about ten o clock in the evening—this is his property Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How do you know it A It is one of two which I had ordered to be made in a particular way the top rivets being made flush—the general way of making them is to have all the rivets but the top ones made flush—these were made to fit into an iron frame—I never saw one like these—they were made at my own suggestion which I thought an improvement to form a portable copper COURT Q Are you able to swear to the best of your belief that that is the copper you lost A Yes FRANCIS KEYS I am an officer of Marylebone On Friday the 16th of January I went to the prisoner s house in Boston-place—I found the male prisoner—I told him I had a warrant to search the house—I asked if his name was Hickman—he said Yes —I went into the shop which is a marine store and rag shop—I searched for some other things but I found this copper in the front room up stairs a bed-room it was covered with rags and old bolsters—I said Here is a new copper how do you account for that He said It is one we have had for some time we bought it at Pontifex s in St Martin s-lane I took it away with the male prisoner and Mr Peaton identified it—the female prisoner did not come home while I was there—there was a man there very much afflicted who I understood to be her husband JOSEPH COLLARD I am an officer I went with Keys to the house—we found the male prisoner there—I waited I suppose two hours till the female prisoner came home—she came into the shop and took off her cloak—I was in the shop—I asked her if her name was Hickman—the said it was—I then told her I had been searching her house for some property supposed to be stolen that we had found it and she must go with me to the office—she said she was certain she had no property in her house but what she had come honestly by and she was very willing to go to the office as she could account for every thing—we then left her house Q How do you know it was her house A My brother officer asked the young man if his name was Hickman—he said Yes As I was going along with the female prisoner I told her we had found a copper and asked how she accounted for the possession of it—she said O the copper is it I came honestly by it I bought it of Mr Pugh in Greyhound-yard Holborn —I said no more having heard her son tell my brother officer that they had bought it at Pontifex s—I had searched the house and found no other copper there—when we arrived at the office the magistrate had left and the prisoners were locked in separate cells which adjoined out another I heard the female prisoner call out to the male prisoner Bill it is the copper they have brought us here for you know we bought that at Pugh s in Greyhound-yard Holborn for 16s about the 14th of last month —the male prisoner replied I have told a lie about the copper mother—I told them we bought it at Pontifex s in St Martin s-lane where we had sold the old pieces of brass —she said with an oath That will not do you fool —immediately after that a man came into the yard whom we had seen at the house in Boston-place—he called out Hickman Mrs Hickman answered Is that you calling him by a name which I forget—he said Yes —the then said They have got us here locked up about a copper will you go down to Pugh s in Greyhound-yard Holborn and ask him for the bill of it it cost 16s and was bought about the 14th of last month —she repeated these words several times and asked him if he understood it he said he did and went away he was gone perhaps two hours when he came back and called again Hickman to let them know he had returned—I was waiting in the office they could not see nor hear me the man then said Mrs Hickman what was the use of sending me on such a fool s errand as that Pugh knows nothing about a copper he does not know at all what you mean he does not understand you he says he never sold you any copper —she then said Aye I was in liquor when I told you that—you must go up to the old man meaning her husband in Boston-place Q Do you know that he was her husband A No but the son had called him father two or three times and told him what our business was—he was in the parlour behind the shop—he is afflicted with apoplexy I believe and has lost the use of his side and his speech—he was scarcely able to walk—I should say decidedly he was not able to carry on the business of the house—he could not give directions because he could not speak but he seemed to understand every thing JURY Q Did you hear him speak A He could make a noise signifying No —I asked him several questions forgetting he was in that situation—if an article had been offered for tale he was not capable of giving his answer—he could signify by signs—I am quite positive he could not carry on the trade of the house COURT Q What did the prisoner Elizabeth say to the man in the yard A She told him he must go to the old man and she said The copper you know that we gave 16s for on the 14th of last month at Pugh s go and ask the old man for the bill he will find it on the file —the man set off—I went with him—we went into the back parlour and found the old man just where I had left him in the morning—he was sitting down—he has the use of one hand and was smoking his pipe—I told him his wife wanted the bill off the file of the copper that was bought at Pugh s—he shook himself and made a sort of motion and said Hum hum and began to cry very much—I asked him where the file was that he kept his bills on—he pointed me to two—I took them down and looked over them very care-fully but I could find no bill of the copper on either of them—I asked him if he had a bill for the copper at all—he again made a sort of noise meaning No —I said Nor ever had I suppose —he again made the same noise Q Was the noise the same when he appeared to mean yes and no A I understood him No —he never had occasion to answer me Yes Cross-examined by MR CHURCHILL Q When you went to the old man did you expect an answer A No—I knew he could point out where the bill would be—he was capable of attending to business so at to point out where one thing or another was—he can get out of his chair and move from one part of the room to another—he is capable of knowing every thing that is brought into the shop in a way of business—I should think as far as intellect went he was capable of attending to business Q Then is there any thing more than physical infirmity that prevents his attending to the whole business A I think not—he is capable of signifying what he wishes to be done—I did not take the files away—there were perhaps thirty or forty papers on each file—I read every one—it was on the 16th of January that this woman said We bought it on the 14th of last month —she had been in custody two hours EVAN PUGH I live in Greyhound-yard Holborn My wife is half-sister to Mrs Hickman—I never sold this copper to her or to her son or to any body in their house—I know nothing about it—I never sold Hickman a halfpennyworth of any thing in my life—I have been to the house but I believe it is more than two years since Elizabeth Hickman s Defence I bought the copper under my husband s direction of a man who told me he came from Mr Pugh understanding I wanted a copper—I had but 10s at the time—I asked my husband if I should borrow 6s to make up the money he said Ay —he can say six words very well—I asked him if he thought it was all right and he said Ay —we always act under his direction—he can put down things with his left hand JAMES HARDING I am a painter and live at No 49 Burton-place I know the prisoners and know the husband—I have visited the house every day since the prisoners have been committed—the husband carries on the business—he is fully competent to it—he is able to walk from one street to another and gives directions—this woman bears a very good character for honesty ELIZABETH HICKMAN— GUILTY Aged 61 — Transported for Fourteen Years

which had lately before been stolen well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution RICHARD DE LA HUNT I am a grocer and live at Bushy On Friday the 23rd of January I was in possession of a pony a harness and saddle—on the Saturday morning I went to the stable for it and the pony the cart the saddle and other things stated were gone—I went with Pye the constable to Red Lion-street Spitalfields on the 13th of February—I saw the prisoner there—I saw my pony in the stable and took him out—I knew him directly—I saw they had cut a piece off his tail—I found my saddle in the prisoner s house—I went the same evening with the officer to a house in White s-row Whitechapel where I found my horse collar the cushion seat and a part of the cart which had my name on it—I have seen two or three docks of tails but I cannot say whether either of them belonged to my pony ISAAC PYE I am constable of Chipping Barnet I received information of the loss of various horses carts and harness and in consequence of information I went to Red Lion-street Spitalfields on the 13th of February with the prosecutor—we found the prisoner there—I said I had come to search his premises for some horses carts and harness—he said he would go and get a candle and lantern—he has a very large yard there and a great many stables and cellars and sheds—he got a lantern—I went into the lower stable and there saw a bay horse which the prosecutor owned as his—I am not aware that he saw the horse s tail at that time—I then went into the prisoner s house and found a riding-saddle—I then went to White s-row which I should think is a quarter of a mile from Red Lion-street—I found this cushion there and the prosecutor found this collar and part of his cart with his name upon it—I saw two horse s docks found in a locker in White-street—I saw one of them put to the horse but I am not judge enough myself to know whether it belonged to him or not—William Saunders and James Griffiths came there—I asked the prisoner whose the premises were in White-street—he said they were his that he had hired them but he had let them to somebody else to put something in but he was answerable for the rent but he could not tell me the person s name—I found a number of other articles in Red Lion-street where he was living—I have brought some of them—they have been owned by Angas Alwin and Ringer who stated they had been stolen from them Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q You found the prisoner on his premises A Yes and be said he would get a light—I was at his door at the time—he made no difficulty but showed me the premises—they are large premises and consist of different stables and sheds—they would hold a great many carts—I do not know that persons leave their carts there when they come from market—horse-hair is an article in extensive sale—the prisoner showed his premises to me willingly—if he had not I should have compelled him—I had employed John Comber JOHN COMBER I live near Whetstone I know Pye the officer—I went to him in January last—I have been in difficulties myself—I was in custody on a charge of horse-stealing but I was not guilty then—on the 24th of January I met William Showell in Newgate-market—from what he said I went to the Elephant and Castle on the 29th of January—I met him again in Smithfield on the 6th of February—I there saw a man named Thomas Douglas and I went with him to the prisoner s stable in Red Lion-street—Douglas there showed me a cart which he said had belonged to a grocer at Bushy—it was the same cart the prosecutor afterwards claimed—I bought it for 2l and left 5s —I then went with Douglas to White-street to look at another cart-body—I bought that also—it was the cart and wheels but the springs and axles had been taken away and pawned—I then went back to the prisoner s with Douglas—there was some conversation between the prisoner and him—we had some gin and then I drew the cart with Douglas to the Ram Inn Smithfield—I pushed behind—on the Monday night following I took away the other cart from White-street—Stratford the prisoner and William Saunders and two others were there—they quarrelled about the division of the money—I took Mr De La Hunt s cart to Ham s Livery-stables in Gray s-inn-lane and there Mr De La Hunt saw it and claimed it Cross-examined Q When did the prisoner say it was the gorcer s cart at Bushy A On the 6th of February—I had never seen him before—Douglas went to show me the cart which was on the prisoner s premises—I went to buy it—Douglas went into Stratford s house to him—I do not know what passed between them—Douglas said in the presence of the prisoner that it was a grocer s cart from Bushy and he had said so before but when I went to the prisoner s premises I asked again—I had my reasons for doing so—I am a colt-breaker and a horse-dealer by commission for any gentleman—I have been so fourteen years only while I was incarcerated—I get horses where I can—I have dealt in Northamptonshire in horses—I never got into any difficulty there—I never had a key turned upon me in my life till I was in Horsemonger-lane which was in 1830—I was liberated last February twelvemonth—I was tried and in prison three years and two months—it was done out of spite—they made horse-stealing of it—I never was in any trouble at any other time—I was never charged by my master and never was before a Magistrate except once when I suffered for it MR CLARKSON Q Do persons who steal horses know something about persons who receive them A Yes—I found the pony on the prisoner s premises—he said the cart came from a grocer s at Bushy—I took it to the Ram Inn and then to Gray s-inn-lane—I bought the carts from what had passed between me and Pye for the purpose of bringing the prisoner to justice—Douglas Showell and the prisoner were all acquainted JOSEPH RINGER On the 8th of January or on the morning of the 9th I lost a cart horse and harness—I have seen the cart and harness since JOHN ALWEN On the night of the 6th or the morning of the 7th of January a cart was stolen from my shed at Cudham in Kent—I have seen the body of the cart since Prisoner s Defence The place in White s-row I let to a man named Mitchell who said he kept a cab and was a horse-dealer—I did not go to the premises after I let them to him—I took the premises in Brown-lane and this property was there—I kept a stable to take horses carts and such things to stand and this pony was brought to stand there WILLIAM HUGHES I am a paper-stainer I carry on business in part of Mr Stratford s premises—I know that a painter hat part of the same premises—I have heard that others have part—I have seen people leave carts and fruit and vegetables there and horses on market days—I have seen two or three brought there and some remaining MR CLARKSON Q Are you a master A Yes I and my brother in-law and two sons of mine work there—I live in Greenfield-street which is about five minutes walk from there—I do not know Showell by name—I was never in Court before James Marshall and Thomas Richard Moore gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 33 — Transported for

property—I went to the back of the premises—I saw the ware—house door open—I went in and saw this coat in the warehouse—I came out and went into the shop—the prisoner George Fisher was there—my sergeant told me to look after him—he then went out into the yard—I went with him—he went into the stable seemed very much agitated and said For God s sake let me get one thing out of the next door or else I shall be transported— his warehouse is next door —I said I should not do any thing of the kind—his wife then went by and he threw some keys to her—she then opened the door of the warehouse and slammed it after her—I called out for assistance and we went into the next house and saw Elizabeth Fisher coming down stairs—she said we might search her she had nothing about her—I went up stairs to search the premises and saw this coat which I had seen in the prisoner s warehouse hanging on the door—I asked George Fisher if he knew any thing about that coat—he said he knew nothing about it and his wife said the same—it was in Mr Skinner s house I found the coat Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Who went with you to the prisoner s house A The inspector the acting inspector and another officer—I saw this coat in the front room in the warehouse—the other officers did not go there with me—they stood in the shop—I went into the warehouse by myself—I examined this coat—I took it in my hand—I saw it had six capes—there was no one with me at the time—I then went into the front shop and saw the male prisoner there—I do not know that he saw in what direction I came in—I came in by the back door—I do not know whether he knew that I must have seen the coat there—the other officers were searching among the rags—they had their eye on the prisoners—the wife opened the warehouse-door with the key and slammed it after her—I had been in that warehouse before but I went in at the back door—she unlocked the front door—I saw her do it and called out for assistance—I did not Jay hold of her as I was afraid of the male prisoner going—Mr Skinner s house is not in a line with the prisoner s house and the warehouse—their house is at the corner—Skinner s is the next to the warehouse—I had not been in Skinner s house before I found the coat—Sergeant Collier was with me at that time—this coat was hanging on the top of the door which was open—it was very conspicuous—no one could have gone by without seeing it—I told Collier when I saw the coat that I had seen it in the warehouse—I had not before mentioned that I had seen it COURT Q Could this woman have got out of the warehouse again without unlocking the door A Yes at the back door—she did not know that door was open—when she opened the front door with the key she could go through the house JOHN COLLIER police-sergeant P 8 I went with the last witness—Mrs Fisher came down stairs got over two little garden fences and went into Mr Skinner s house—I went into Skinner s house and examined it—there was no great-coat there then—I am sure it could not be there then—I then went to the prisoner s and in a few minutes I went to Skinner s again and found this coat hanging on the back room door—I am sure it was not there when I first went—Mrs Fisher had an opportunity of going to Skinner s in the intermediate time—I found some tickets in the coat pocket and in the sleeve by which I found the prosecutor Cross-examined Q It would have been very easy for them to have destroyed these tickets A Yes I went without any one to Skinner s the first time I believe—I am not positive whether Wright was with me or not—I do not think we went together—I examined all the rooms—this coat was not there then I am sure—when I went the second time I went with the last witness—I did not threaten Mrs Skinner nor did any one in my presence

Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How soon did you see this property again A On the 25th and 27th of April last—we never found the person who stole them—I know this guard by its being a very peculiar pattern—it is silver gilt—I never saw one of the pattern in my life—I bought it at Machin and Debenham s rooms—I should presume it is town-made—there might be others of the same pattern or this might be one made to a particular order I should think it was these two rings were partly made in my shop they are gold and worth 1s each SIMEON BENJAMIN I am the prosecutor s brother On the 12th of May he left me in care of his shop—I left it at a quarter-past nine o clock all secure—I returned at a quarter-past ten o clock found the door open and several persons round—a good deal of property was

this time—he brought me a small lot of jewellery among which I observed a ring which I had made for Mr Benjamin—he came on the 25th of April and brought several other things among which I observed some of the same description of rings—I did not buy the goods—I took them to Mr Benjamin myself BENJAMIN JONES I am a porter I took these articles to Mr Smith s to be valued—I bought them of the prisoner—he told me he had some cheap lots by him which he had bought the duplicates of—I cannot tell exactly when it was—it may be four or five months ago—I was going down Pancras-street there were two young men in his shop one of them I knew and he was showing one of them a silver guard—the young man called me and said Jones here is a cheap lot for you —the prisoner is a locksmith and bell-hanger by trade—I called there a few days afterwards and he said a friend of his threw in a raffle and be put them into pawn that he got the duplicates and took them out himself—he called me in again and said there was a cheap lot that I might get a shilling or two by—I said If I could sell one or two of them I might have the lot and I had them two or three weeks in my possession before I took them to the jeweller s to be valued—I did not buy them out and out—I saw the silver chain the first time and I bought it a few days afterwards that might be three or four days afterwards—I cannot tell the day nor the month it might be three or four months ago or more—the young man who was in the shop knew me—the street I live in is just opposite his house—the young man s father shoes for us—I

third lot—the first lot was a chain I bought that for 9s or 9s 6d and sold it to a shoemaker—I sold two lots to some other young men—the third lot I took to Mr Smith—it was the middle lot that I gave

two years—I have been in a raffle since I have been in their employ for a watch or something—I have not put up things to be raffled for—I was at a raffle in London-street—two or three and twenty people were present—they were all young men—some of them were Murphy s and Dry s shopmen—I never raffled for any jewellery or plate or any articles of that kind GEORGE STONE police-constable C 99 I went with Benjamin to a house in Pancras-street on the 25th of April last—I saw the prisoner there—the prosecutor and Jones were there—Jones said That s the man I had the things of —I asked the prisoner how he came in possession of these things he said They were left me for rent by a lodger of mine —I asked him who the man was—he told me his name but I do not recollect it—he said the man was gone to America—he said he was a jeweller who worked at home in the house and he saw him make these things I am sure of that—I had some seals and other things then in my hand and he said I saw him make them I asked him if he had any more he said yes he had a few more but when he was told he was in custody and that the things were stolen from Mr Benjamin he said he had no more and he did not know what we meant—we took him to the station-house after searching his room—on the following Monday we went to search his shop and found some more things—I had the key of his room and his shop but after we took him to the station-house on the Saturday night I went back to the shop and found in a table-drawer a pair of gold ear-rings and a pair of silver table-spoons and I found there a great number of skeleton-keys a crow-bar dark lantern and on the Monday we found some guard-chains seals snaps silver thimbles brooches and other things in the workshop—the watch was found by Mr Benjamin in the parapet over the room—I had seen the seals hanging out of the prisoner s watch-pocket on the Saturday night I then lost sight of them and could not find it anywhere—I had opened the window near

know it is a house full of lodgers but no one was in the room but us for I locked the door—the landlord lives in the bottom part of the house—I had had Jones in custody about half an hour before I went to the prisoner—Jones said he could find the man he had them of—I did not search the shop before I took the prisoner away—I searched the room—I did not find any thing there but after he had been taken away I went and found the other things in the workshop which is on the other side of the way—Jones lives in Tottenham-court-road which is about two hundred yards from the prisoner s or more—I saw Murphy and Dry on the Saturday night when I took Jones—I went to the prosecutor s premises at the time of the robbery—I believe they had been opened by a skeleton-key—I have no doubt that some of these skeleton-keys would open the prosecutor s door THOMAS HOBBS I went with Stone on the Monday to the prisoners—I found this mug wrapped up in a bit of paper in the attic—I found four buttons and some skeleton-keys in a drawer under a work-bench in the shop SIMEON BENJAMIN re-examined Q What appearances were there to show how any person had got into your shop A There was nothing to show in all probability they got in by a key LEWIS BENJAMIN Here are two rings among this property which Smith made for me in this lot which Jones took to his house—the rest of these articles are made at

10l 3 pair of flanches value 20s 2 metal bends value 10s 1 pair of shoes value 3s and 3 quires of paper value 1s the goods of the Commissioners of Greenwich Hospital and 3 pair of flanches value 20s and 2 metal bends value 10s the goods of John Braithwaite and others well knowing the same to have been feloniously stolen against the Statue WILLIAM THOMAS I am a police-inspector On the 8th of Septemper I went to No 4 Thames-street Greenwich—I entered at the front door—I did not see either of the prisoners there—there is a gate at the side of the house large enough for a cart and gig to go under—on going it at that gate I found a shed with an earth floor—on examining the door I found a piece of brass at the side and a write attached to it at one end and the other end attached to the latch—on pressing my foot against this brass part of the door flew open large enough to admit a man—I turned into the middle shop and on examing the floor discovered a trap-door which led into a vault under the shed—the trap was made in a slanting position so that a man might slide down on his back and in the vault I found a large quantity of sheet copper—on weighing it I found one ton eleven hundredweight and a half of copper and three ton three hundred weight of sheet lead and this flanch—all these were in the vault—I afterwards went up stairs and in a small chest of drawers found a quantity of Writing-paper—the drawer was not locked—there was a shop in front of the premises being fitted up as a plumper and glazier s—I did not perceive any name written up in front JOSEPH TITE I am a policeman I was in charge of the house on the second day—the female prisoner had been taken into custody before that—I never saw the male prisoner near the house—while I was there I found some more paper behind the drawers in the front parlour and found a brass tap in the yard JAMES WILD I am a policeman I went to the house on the 7th of September and found two copper bends and two flanches in the back parlour cupboard—I found twenty-five hundredweight of pig lead under the floor of the front shop and one ton seventeen hundredweight of solder and under the stairs I found a quantity of brass cocks WILLIAM BRAITHWAITE I am an engineer I made some flanches for a brewhouse at the Hospital—I supplied them with these—they are made of a peculiar metal and these two bends were supplied by me to the Hospital—I am in the employ of John Braithwaite Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Are you not in a very extensive buisness A Yes we supply a great many flanches to different brewers—there is no particular stamp on these nor on the bends—they are made of copper tinned over—we call them tin copper bends—I sent four to the Hospital and I have weighed the two found and the two left and they agree exactly with the weight charged—I will not swear those I have supplied to other breweries may not weigh the same—I have no mark to denote that they belong to the Hospital—they were furnished in May 1833 and have never been used—they were put aside until the alternations were complete by order of the clerk of the works MR BODKIN Q Were you backwards and forwards at the hospital A Yes continually WILLIAM SIVELL I have examined the sheet copper found on the second day at the prisoner s house and compared it with that taken by the four men on the first day—to the best of my judgement it tallied exactly and is part of the copper taken from the roof of the infirmary to the best of my judgement—we had not missed it at the time but afterwards missed about a ton and a half—I ascertained the loss by referring to the books to see the quantity laid on the roof and measuring the roof to see the quantity it would take—I calculate two tons have been abstracted—the copper found the first day has marks corresponding with the boards and these bear the same marks Cross-examined by CLARKSON Q produce what you have compared A Here is one piece which I took from the roof myself and compared with some found in the vault under the shop—I superintend the works at the hospital and have the care of the property—It is the same sort of copper and here are some black marks on it—copper varies in quality and thickness—I have no private mark on it—nearly all of it has this black line on it—It is the mark of the rafter—It was taken from the roof of the infirmary—the whole of the copper has been taken off and the roof slated—It was done about two months ago—copper looks different after being exposed to the atmosphere long—this appears just the same as what remains—copper varies two or three ounces in a foot which makes a differences in the substance THOMAS COPE I am a policeman I went to the house and found a pair of shoes there JOHN LIVINGSTON JAY I am chief clerk in the secretary s office at Greenwich Hospital There are five Commissioners—Mr Locker is one and has been so since June 1829—this paper is ruled—when I was before the Magistrate I compared it with a form used in the hospital —It is addressed to certain officers in the hospital in a printed form—part of the heading to the columns is torn off—the part left enables me to swear to it as a form used in the hospital Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q May there not be hundreds of places where the same form is used A I should say no place could use such a form—I do not know whether Chelses Hospital may not—the first Commissioner of Woods and Forests and the Treasure of the Navy were appointed commissioners at the change of the Administration BLACKWELL CARTER I know these shoes belong to the hospital by the stamp on them G H and a crown—they are furnished to the pensioners—I believe they have been worn Cross-examined Q Are not pensioners in the habit of selling their shoes A I cannot say ESTHER MARY PATTISON I let the house in Thames-street to the male prisoner—he had a lease of it—I gave him posseation a few days after Michaclmas—there was no vault under the back shed at that time to my knowledge—I had lived there seven years and never knew of it—I had no spring to open the door by pressing with the foot nor any shoot to communicate with a vault Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you live in the house yourself A No a person named Francis lived there—I lived at No 1 MR BOBKIN Q Have you not known the house for seven years A Yes I am the landlady—I did not collect the rent—I have been there occasionally—I never knew of this place MR PHILLIPS Q I suppose when you went it was into the parlour A Yes I was there a few days before the prisoner took possession—I did not examine the lower part of the house—I let it to pearce for a short time just before the prisoner took possesstion WILLIAM JAMES PEARCE I am an assistant to the water bailiff I had the use of these premises for a year and a half—there was no trap-door in the shop that I knew of—there was nothing but plain earth in the shed—It has been pulled down since I left and rebuilt—I knew of no vault under it nor any shoot communicating with one—I never was in the dwelling-house—I occupied the shed and shop only—I left it in June—there was no spring to the door then Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You do not mean to say there was no vault A No but it was undiscovered by me WILLIAM THOMAS re-examined The shop is a quarter of a mile from the hospital—all the copper was folded in separate pieces of 16 or

value 4l 10lbs of isinglass value 7l and 5lbs of scammony value 3l the goods of Charles Buchannan well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statue &c MR BODKIN conducted the prosecution CHARLES BUCHANNAN I am a wholesale druggist and live in Thames-street John Foster was my porter for about twelve months—about eight months in my individual service and four months previously in the service of myself and another—I came to town to the warehouse on Monday morning the 19th of October and Foster made a communication to me—I found there was an appearance of violence to the window and some parts of my warehouse—a chest of manna had been broken in one room and a chest of saffron was broken and I missed a parcel of isinglass—from sixty to seventy pounds of manna had been taken the chest was quite empty—it was worth 5s per pound—I got the assistance of Josiah Evans the officer and I pointed out to him the marks of violence which my premises presented—in a subsequent part of the day I gave Foster to Maclean—l had him taken from something said by the officer—Foster then made a statement voluntarily without any promise on my part and in consequence of what he said I went to the prisoner s house in Hackney-road with Roe and Maclean—he carries on the business of a confectioner—Roe went in first I followed him momentarily—Maclean entered at the same time with Foster—Cohen was at home in the front shop—Roe called him backwards into his house there being persons in the shop—they went into his back parlour and we followed immediately—nothing was asked in the front shop—when we got into the back parlour Roe had put questions to which he was apparently giving an answer—I did not hear what he said distinctly—the first question I heard Roe put was Where are the goods you received this morning —he replied I will show you and attempted to go out of the back door near which he was then standing—Roe refused to allow him to leave the room and insisted upon his stating where they were—he made several attempts to induce Roe to allow him to show where they were and finding he would not he said My wife shall show you —his wife came in almost immediately I suppose two minutes after we entered the house and when she came in she said What are these gentlemen wanting —the prisoner said They are come about the bag that came this morning show them where it is —she look Roe into the yard and he brought from a building in the yard a bag containing manna and a paper bag containing isinglass—I examined the bag containing manna and have since seen it weighed—it is rather more than sixty pounds—I have no doubt but that it is of the same kind and quality as that lost from my warehouse—I had seen the same bag in my warehouse the Friday previous—whilst there there was a man who appeared to be an acquaintance of Cohen—he asked him From whom did you receive those goods pointing to the two bags—Cohen s reply was That is the man —pointing to Foster who was in a corner of the room—it is utterly impossible to recognise the isinglass but the bag I had seen on the Tuesday preceding Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Have you any partner A No Foster gave me no information with respect to this till he was taken into custody—he was not a witness before the Grand Jury—he was there ready if called—he told me before I went in what he could say and I gave them the same account that I have given to—day—I did not give evidence before the Grand Jury where the bill was ignored—the manna came from James Metcalf and Co who are druggists—I do not know whether they send out these sort of bags—it came to me empty to be filled with certain goods—it was the first bag I received from them and the last—I had had it three weeks but the order was countermanded—I told the Justice that Cohen pointed to Foster an said That is the man —I do not know whether that was taken down—my evidence was read over to me to sign—I believe it was taken down—I had sent for the officer before Foster gave me any information—I had him before the Magistrates subsequently on this charge and he was committed for trail—I sent him before the Grand Jury because I had got information which I could support by affidavit—he had been in my employ about twelve months—he never gave the least information till he was in custody—I did not tell him if he gave evidence he should not be tried—I shall not indict him—I gave him no intimation of that—nor have I told any one else to tell him nor given any instruction to do so—when Cohen said That is the man a man was present I do not know his name he stated himself to be a horse-dealer JOHN ROE I am an officer I was called to the prosecutor s premises on the morning of the 19th and was shown certain appearances as of breaking into the premises—they certainly did not appear as if caused by persons from without the premises—after you enter you go along the passage then there is a window which had been pushed out—I looked at the window-sill and saw the dust was there and no person had gone over it—I looked over the place and the result was that no person had come from outside—I told Mr Buchanan so and then Foster was taken—he made a statement to Mr Buchanan—I then went with them to Cohen s in Hackney-road about half-past four o clock in the afternoon—I went and saw Cohen in the shop and another person talking to him—I beckoned him to come to me in the back-room—I pointed to Foster who was then standing in the shop with Maclean and Mr Buchanan—I asked Cohen if he knew him—he said No —I asked him if he had purchased any goods of him—he said No —I said Where are the bags of goods brought by the porter this morning he said Let me fetch my wife and she shall get them —I said No —he then asked me again—I said No —at that moment the wife came in—he asked her to get the bag that was brought there by the porter that morning—she then took me to a back wash-house and gave me the bag of manna which was shown to Mr Buchanan and identified—I also found some isinglass in a bag it was standing by the side of the manna—I then searched the place but found nothing else Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Then your conversation was more directed to the wife than to the prisoner A It was so—I did not hear Cohen say he received them from Foster—he denied that he knew Foster but he never denied having the goods on the premises—I had heard something about saffron—Foster made no communication to me—he has not to my knowledge given any account of what has become of the saffron JOSIAH EVANS I was called into Mr Buchanan s on the morning of the 19th —I concurred with Roe in thinking that the premises were not broken into from the outside JOSEPH FOSTER I was seventeen years old last July I have been to Mr Buchanan s service about twelve months—I have known the prisoner between four and five months—I was going by his shop and I went in to buy something—I had a few pods of tamarinds in my hand at the time—he asked me whether I had got any of them to dispose of—I told him no I had none—he asked me two or three times—I told him no and I went out—he kept questioning me to know whether I had any to sell—I did not tell him who I was—nothing else passed that night—I saw him again the next morning—he was standing at the door which I had to pass in going from my house to the warehouse—he stopped me and asked if I had any to dispose of and said he would give me a very good price—I told him I had none—he walked a little way with me and kept questioning me—at last I took him down some—at that time he did not know where I worked—he asked me very soon after and I told him I worked for Messrs Buchanan and Meggeson—he said he knew some of their men very well and asked whether I could get any things so that my master should not know—if I could get it to his house he could get it away directly so that no one should know about it—after this I had dealings with him often and I received money from him a great many times—he walked with me several mornings and asked if my master did not deal in saffron and different things—he saw me often enough to know me—on the Saturday in question some saffron gambooge tamarinds and isinglass was taken from my master s warehouse and on the Monday morning some manna was taken from the middle floor there—it was in a box—I stole it—I took I suppose about 50lbs —I put it into a cloth bag and took it to the public-house at the corner of Fish-street-hill and asked if I could leave it there—I did not know Thomas King at that time—I saw him standing outside the public-house—I asked him if he knew Hackney-road—he said Yes —I asked if he knew Mr Cohen—he said No —I gave King the bag to take to Mr Cohen—when I asked him if he knew him he said he did not know him but he dare say he should find it—I told him to take it to Mr Cohen a little beyond the church on the left-hand side—he then took the bag—it was about half-past eleven o clock in the morning—that was about two hours and a quarter after I had brought it from the warehouse—I brought it out at about five minutes to nine—I had had some conversation with Cohen that morning about the manna—I saw him at his house at about eight o clock—I asked him whether he could come and take the manna—he said no he could not carry so much for twenty guineas—I told him there was about a cwt —that was what I guessed it at—I had not taken it out of the chest—one shilling a pound was to be given for it—Cohen stated that—I remember Mr Buchanan coming to the warehouse that day—I told him of a robbery at the place—I had caused the window and rails to present that appearance which I pointed out to Mr Buchanan—what I told him about it was false—the officer was sent for—I was afterwards taken into custody Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Then you not only stole your master s property but got up a sort of drama for him A Yes I was never a thief till I went to this gentleman s employment and never would have been if it had not been for the prisoner—I was very much shocked at first but it gradually wore off—I did not turn thief before I went to Mr Cohen s—I got the tamarinds from an empty cask in the wharf and I was eating them as I went along—that is about four or five months ago—I went into Cohen s to buy two or three pennyworth of apples or sweet stuff—Mr Cohen sold apples—I did buy something—I do not know what it was—no one was sleeping in the warehouse that night—I had the charge of it—I began to pull down the paling at about half-past five o clock—I took the bars down and the wooden palings inside the warehouse—I intented my master to believe that the house had been broken upon—the window was on the first floor and he might think the thief had keys—I do not know who King is nor how he gets his living—he stood outside the door rather better than one hundred yards off—it was about half-past eleven o clock when I spoke to him—I had not seen him before—there was no one on the premises to help me to sham this robbery—I did it all out of my own head—Cohen did not tell me to do it but he told me he would have a horse and cart down to take the things away—he said he could not that morning but he would the next but I wanted the things away—Mr Buchanan has had me about six months—I had lived with Buchanan and Meggeson before for about six months—I have been examined about thirteen months ago at the Old Bailey about one month before I went to Buchanan and Meggeson in the Old Court as it was called—a young man broke into a house and he had some money and asked me to mind it—but I did not know he broke into the house—it was four sovereigns—his name was Smith—I had known him sometime we were not quite pals—a pal is any one you get acquainted with I should think—I was not to plant the four sovereigns he asked me to mind them for him—I do not know what planting means—I do not know that it is the slang phrase for concealing them—I was not in gaol on that charge I was taken up as a witness—I went before the Grand Jury—the bill was ignored but they believed me—I had not been examined before—I had lived with Mr Tully a grocer before I went into the prosecutor s service—I left him because he had got nothing for me to do—it was not his house that was broken but Mr Serjeant s of Clapton-square—I used to go there for order of a morning—the man who broken open the house and gave me the money to mind was working at Mr Serjeant s and he asked me if I would mind that as he was going to stop out all night—I did not ask where it came from—he came and asked me for the four sovereigns the next morning and I gave them to him—he was taken up I believe the next day Q I suppose when you found that a robbery had been committed you went and gave information A No I did not they asked me if I knew any thing about it—I then lived at Mr Piddock s a quarter of a mile from Mr Serjeant s—I felt sorry for what I had done before I was taken into custody but not before I saw Mr Buchanan THOMAS KING I am a porter On Monday morning the 19th of October I was at the foot of London-bridge between eleven and twelve o clock close to Thames-street—a young man came to me in shirt-sleeves in a hurry and gave me a bag to take to Hackney-road—I took it to Mr Cohen s house by his direction—it is a sweetmeat shop I think—I delivered it to a man in a fustian jacket in the shop—I said I understand this bag is for you —he said Yes did he pay you —I said Yes and left the bag on the counter Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You would not know either of the persons again A I do not know that I should COURT to JOHN ROE Q When you went to the prosecutor s warehouse were there wooden rails there A Yes they are fixed to a partition is the first floor—they had been broken down and a window on the staircase was out THOMAS BRISTOW I am an umbrella-maker in Church-street Hackney I know Cohen s shop in Hackney-road—I saw Foster go there once about the beginning of August—I had been to London for materials and he overtook me in Shoreditch he said he had to call in Hackney-road—I went into the shop with him and had one pennyworth of filberts—I came out again with Foster and then he went in again and I waited for him—he came out in about ten minutes and we went on together Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How long had you known him A About six years—I knew him at the time Mr Serjeant s house was broken—I often go into Foster s house and he comes into mine—we are on friendly terms—I have no notion of going to travel with him after this trial in over or of going to Jamaica with him—I might have said so but in no other way than a joke—I did say so just now in Court but to no one in particular—any one might have heard it—I did not say to Jamaica Q How came you to say you did say it if you did not A I said I was going to Jamerica—I said it to myself—I did not say Foster was going with me—I did not mention Foster s name in conjunction with myself as being going to travel—I have got trade enough at home to keep me Q Did you not say you were going to travel to Jamerica with Foster Witness A Can you tell me where Jamerica is I will not be certain whether I mentioned Foster s name in conjunction with myself or not—I did not tell you that I did not mention his name Q Are you aware that you are on your oath in every answer you have given me A O yes yes I said I was going to Jamerica—I am not aware that I swore that I did not mention Foster s name FRANCIS MACLEAN I am a Police Inspector I examined the prosecutor s premises and then went to Cohen s—I produce the bags and property—I heard what Roe stated JOSEPH FOSTER This is the bag I delivered to King CHARLES BUCHANAN This is the bag that was in my warehouse—I know this paper which was in the bag of isinglass Prisoner s Defence On Saturday night Foster came to my house—I had not seen him before—he asked if I could buy some goods as he had some he could send on Monday morning and on Monday the goods came I told him I could not say the price before I saw the articles and told him to come on Monday but he did not I asked him if he got them honestly—he said he could bring me the till and receipt for them Nineteen witnesses gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 36 — Transported for Fourteen Years Fifth Jury before Mr Common Sergeant 
t18351214-297  297 THOMAS JACKSON was indicted for feloniously receiving of an evil-disposed person on the 23d of November at St Paul Deptford 2 bronze images value 100l the goods of Benjamin Oakley well knowing them to be stolen Mr ADOLPHUS conducted the Prosecution BENJAMIN OAKLEY I live at Eden Cottage at Beckenham in Kent I had three bronze images on my lawn and missed two on the 23rd of November—they would be four or six feet high if they stood upright—one was a Grecian female figure resting on a plinth the other was a dying gladiator—here is a drawing representing them as nearly as possible—It was produced before the Justice at the examination and shown to Margaret O Neill—they have never been found—I offered a reward of ten guiness for the recovery of them Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q That was made public through all the neighbourhood A Yes the bills were circulated a few days afterwards—here is a copy of the bill MARGARATE O NEIL My husband is a labouring man—on the 23rd of November I lived at the priosner s house in Mill-lane Deptford—he is a dealer in marine stores and lets out carts and horses—four weeks ago last Monday night at about eleven o clock I saw a cart stop at his door—I was up stairs looking out of my bed-room window—It was a clear night—my window is on the first floor—they had a lighted candle out of doors—I went to the window—looked out and saw a cart stop at the door—I saw a man named Parish go in and bring out Mr Jackson—there was a young man with the cart besides Parish—Mr Jackson came out and held the candle in his hand—Parish went to the cart and said to the boy in it Come out of the cart David —parish went and stripped down some hay for the images—Jackson was present—the images were covered with hay—he turned to Jackson and said Jackson how long is it since you saw your grandfather —I thought it was a joke about the images—they laughed about it down stairs and I laughed up stairs at the window and they said to me Take in your head from that window and don t be grinning there —I said I think you will grin somewhere by-and-by —I stopped at the window till they brought both the images in—they first brought in the male figure and then the female figure—the first was what they called the grandfather—I could not see what it represented—the man had a curled head and the other was a woman with her head leaning on her shoulder—they left the horse and cart and took the images in and closed the gate—there is a pair of gates to the house and a yard—I then went to bed and was not many minutes in bed before Mrs Jackson came up stairs and said Mrs O Neil my dear come down and see the images for they have come at last —I went down stairs to the kitchen and saw Mr Jackson there sitting with his bark against the table—he had a slate in his hand and a pencil and he said to me Well Mrs O Neil Parish has made a good day to-day —I said Well he can pay to you now what he owes you —I think he said that by his calculation the goods would come to 7l odd—he told me even to the pence but I forget it now—Parish and the other man were not present—they were putting the horse into the stable—I know the cart was Jackson s—I could not read any name on it—I had seen it in his possession several times—my husband has worked it himself—I took the female figure by the hand and said Poor thing how innocent she looks —I looked at the male figure and said I think he is something like death for he was very thin—I put my hand on him—I said Perhaps it may be a scheme off Parish to bring it here when it is not metal and I sounded it with my hand and found it was metal or something—I turned the woman up—I looked at them—they were like this drawing—I should know them in twenty years—I saw the drawing before the Justice—I raised the woman up and looked underneath and said it was either brass or copper—I could not tell which—there was a woman named Mrs Sims in the prisoner s house—she bought the candle behind their backs and she found something on the woman s right shoulder like a name as she thought but she could not read any more that I could—there was another man and his wife in the kitchen when I went down who had been eating their supper—Mr and Mrs Gollocker and Mrs Gollocker got up to see if she could make any thing of the name but she could not—she could read—I sat by the fire lighted a pipe and smoked—I came down on that excuse—Mrs Jackson had called me down but I smoked my pipe after I got down—Parish came in after putting up the horse and the boy who was with him said Now Parish we shall have half-a-pint of rum on the strength of these images —Parish put his hand in his pocket pulled out his purse and gave him some money and said Bring rum and shrub for Mrs Jackson does not drink any thing else —when the boy brought the rum they took it into Ms Jackson s bed-room—I had to go through there to go to my bed-room—they took me by the shoulder and wanted to give me some—I said to myself I would not have it for I would let the people outside know of it and if I wanted rum I could get it—I stood on the stairs afterwards and said to the boy in the prisoner s hearing I think my lad you have brought yourself to something this time for you have been at Bromley all day and I think I know where you got these things —I thought he had got them from the College at Bromley—nothing more passed that night—when I came down on Tuesday morning about seven o clock I looked round to where I had seen the images at night and said to Mrs Jackson Why my God where are the images —her husband was not present he was out—I saw him between two and three o clock on Tuesday—the moment I came into the door he said Well Mrs O Neil that job is settled Parish has paid his door and his horse is now his —I said Well a good thing if you keep him so you need not be fretting and stewing yourself —on Wednesday morning I was going to breakfast and had a few words with my husband but not in anger—Jackson was present and took it up—I said The bigger the rogue was the better he was looked upon —Jackson said Oh Mrs O Neil I know what you are hinting at —I said Well if the cap does not fit you you need not wear it —I was not angry at the time though he might think so—but he smacked his fingers in my face and said Parish and me do not care that for you —I said I will make you care for me you sold the dolls for 16l and put Parish off with 6l —I had heard that from Mrs Parish—I said —I will wear my shoes off but I will find where those images came from I will make you care for me —he said nothing more but he seemed calmer afterwards—that was all that passed—I went to Woolwich about my own affairs and when I came home in the evening I had a few rags which I sold to Jackson—I sell laces and things and take rags and things in exchange for them—he paid me 2s for the rags—I went into the kitchen and was not there many minutes when Mrs Parish came for me—I went with her to Jackson—he stood in his storehouse over the rag-him and he said to me Well Mrs O Neil this is a serious piece of business I said What is the matter —he said Why about these images —I said It is no more than I expected I told you they would be out in hand-bills if a gentleman lost them he would not lose them for a good deal—I thought they were old family concerns —I had not heard of any hand-bills being published at that time—he said Well Mrs O Neil there is a reward out for them of a few pounds —I said Well I know nothing about it and I do not want —Mrs Parish said It is no use to be blindfolding people Jackson for there it guineas —that was the first I heard of a reward and I never thought of it afterwards in my life—If there were a thousand bills in the window I could not read them—he said Well Mrs O Neil the business is as it is and if you keep your mind to yourself and say nothing about what have seen I shall make Parish give you 1l —I said I shall have no pound not any thing at all I want no pound —he said Let me tell you the times are very bad and a pound at this time would be very requisite —I said It would be no use for more had seen it besides me —he said Well but Gollocker must have 1l too for you know that I did not steal them it was not me —he said What a serious thing it would be to take me from my wife and family through it when I had no hand in it —I said I think you had the greatest hand in it for you received them and you sold them as Mrs Parish tells me for 16l and here she is you paid Parish only 6l and charged him 4s for going in your own male cart to make sale of them —he told me the hand-bill was in Mrs Muslins s window at the corner of Mill-lane—I said Well what a place they have chosen to put it the very top of the lane —I came home then—his store-house is four or five doors from the house I live in—Mrs Parish and me went up the lane—she could read the bill—she eyed it out for me in the window and pointed it out but she dare not go near it—I saw a bill there—I came home and went to bed and on Thursday went out to work—on Thursday night when I came home I left Jackson s and went to another house—I said Jackson I have a few rags and bones —he said Well you can have my male and he said I will not have any thing for my cart only 6d for the feed of the mule —he afterwards came out and said What do you think of Parish O Neil don t you think he is a d—rogue I have a mind to turn round upon him —I said nothing to Jackson then—On Friday night Mrs Parish came down to me and wanted to borrow 6d —I said I had not one but I would borrow one of Jackson and I met Jackson against the cage with two men he used to sell his metal to—he said Well there is no down on Parish yet —I said No there is more reason they should be down upon you —he gave me the shilling and I gave it to Mrs Parish—I went to Mrs Maslins s to inquire about the bill as I could not tell where the things came from—I went to Mr Brown the baker for the bill and he went and brought it he read it to me and gave it to me—that was on Friday night—I have got it now—on Saturday morning I got up and had breakfast and went to Mr Oakley s house Eden-cottage—I first went to the constable and his boy took me to the prosecutor s and I told Mr Oakley s what I knew—this was four weeks ago next Saturday—I went to Mr Oakley s the Saturday after the deed was committed on Monday—I went before the Justice on Monday at Deptford Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q I believe the very first thing you said was this happened four weeks last night A Yes that is so—It was about eleven o clock at night—It might be a little before or after—I was examined before the Magistrate and said that Jackson said Parish has made a good day to-day —I believe what I said was taken down in writing and read over to me—I put my mark to it—I am sure I told the Magistrate so—I do not know whether I stated that I said how innocent the lady looked and the man looked like death—all I have said to-day I said before the Magistrate but I might not exactly say he was like death but I said it to myself—I gave proper evidence to the Magistrate—I am sure I told him that I said How innocent she looks and that I took her by the hand and that the prisoner snapped his fingers in my face and said he did not care for me—and that he had sold the dolls for 16l and given Parish only 6l and that I said I would wear my shoes out but I would find who the images belonged to and that he became very calm after that—he was quire calm and good-natured—I do not know whether he liked it or not—I told the Magistrate that the prisoner said Well Mrs O Neil this is a serious piece of business and that I said It was no more than I expecated —I told that to the gentleman who wrote it down and I told the Magistrate that Jackson said he would make Parish give me 1l and that I said I did not wish to mix myself up with it—I do not know whether I would have taken the pound—I might have it if I chose—I believe I owe the prisoner 6s for rent—I do not owe him 10l not 3l —I cannot say whether it was 4l my husband will tell you—I did not contract any debts with Jackson—he never settled with me therefore I do not know—he did not turn me out of the house for he offered me the bed he lay upon if I would stop in his house—he told me himself about this—that came into my own head—jackson did not say there were hand-bills about at that time—I told the Magistrate that I said to the boy You have been to Bromley and got these images —I did not tell him where I thought he had got them from but I thought it to myself—It was taken down and read over to me Q How many persons slept in the room with you and your husband A There were four beds Mrs Gollocker two men me and my husband slept in the room but Mrs Gollocker was not in bed at the time—the two men were in bed—I bed taken nothing to drink that night nor had my husband—I was as sober as possible that night as sober as I am now—I told the magistrate that my head was out of the window looking out and that they asked me what I was grinning at—I did not take notice of the night—I took notice of what was in the cart for I had the light of the candle to see by—the two men who were in bed were close to the window—they were awake and talking to me at the time—I only spoke a word to the people they were laughing all the time—they never got up to see what was going on—they heard me—I told the people outside they would be grinning by-and-by and I said that before the Magistrate and that I said to Jackson The bigger the rogue the better he was looked upon —the clerk took that down and he read it over and asked me if it was true and I afterwards signed it—I had no quarrel with Jackson before I left nor with his wife—I had some words with her because I would not lay in a sick man s bed and she moved my bed—I left the house in consequence of that—I left on good terms with her and with him too—when I came down in the morning at seven o clock Jackson was gone to London—his wife said so—I saw him between two and three o clock that day when I came home in his kitchen—he was not at all well for he was in Dr Smith s care—he

money and bring it home at night—I have got no money except by trade—I never asked Mr Oakley for any—I never had any from him nor from the attorney—he sent for my to go to Bromley and gave me a shilling to get my dinner—I have got no money but what I gave worked for—I was not asked that question before the Magistrate and refused to answer—I was not asked whether I had 2l from the

went and told Mr Oakley from hearing of the reward—this occurrence took place on the Monday and I gave information on the Saturday—I did not go to a Magistrate because if I went and told him they would laugh at me but when I found out the gentleman s name I told him what I knew—the prisoner wanted to give me 1l as a bribe that I should say nothing about it—he thought to throw all the blame on Parish and snare me into it—I don t know what the 10l is to be paid for if I get it well and good if I don t I shan t look for it—I don t know that it is to be paid on the conviction of the prisoner—I went first to Mr Pearce—I got no money from him—all I have done is merely for the sake of justice—I can t wheather the prisoner gave me any copper when he gave me the two shilling for the rags—I may

it for I can neither read nor write and he might not understand me—when he was reading it that man the prisoner s attorney came in and he confused me and I do not know what the clerk said and what he did not—he wanted to baffle me out of it—I left the prisoners in debt—I should not have lived in his house only for fear of being summoned for the debt—I am still in his debt—I was examined before the Justice on the Monday week after transaction—I am quite sure of that—I was taken to the station-house on Saturday night and on Monday went before the Justice—neither the solicitor nor Mr Oakley gave

Mill-lane I had a bill in my window like this—It was put there on the 25th of November—I saw nothing of Mrs O Neil till a day or two after it was taken out of the window Witnesses for the Defence JOHN SMITH I am a surgeon On Monday the 23rd of November I was attending the prisoner for illness—I saw him first on Wednesday the 18th—I saw him between nine and ten o clock on Tuesday evening he was in bed then—I attended him for several days afterwards—I called on Wednesday but he was not at home—he lives about four miles from London Q Did you think him able on the Tuesday to go to London on business as early as six o clock in the morning A I believe it possible but it would not be at all proper—I did not know that he had disobeyed my directions when I saw him on Tuesday evening MR ADOLPHUS Q What was the matter with him A He was affected with pleurisy WILLIAM JONES I am a furrier In November I lived in the prisoner s house and live there still—I remember Monday night the 23rd of November perfectly well—there were four beds in the room I slept in that night—O Neil and his wife occupied one bed—I went to bed at nine o clock of a few minutes before—there was a girl asleep in bed with Mr and Mrs O Neil—to the best of my remembrance she was between fourteen and fifteen years old—I slept in the first bed on the left hand side at the entrance from the stair-case—Mr and Mrs O Neil in the first bed on the right hand side—two strangers in another and Gollocker and his wife in the bed along side Mr and Mrs O Neil—I was not well that night and was awake in great pain till midnight Q Now could any one have got out of Mr O Neil s bed thrown up the window and locked at people out of the window at eleven o clock or about the time without your seeing or hearing it A I am confident they could not—no one did so—Mr and Mrs O Neil were both very much intoxicated that night—the man more so than the woman—I got up in the morning at half-past seven o clock—my illness obliged me to go down stairs twice that night—I consider the first time was about half-past nine o clock and second about a quarter past ten o clock—the prisoner was very ill indeed that night MR ADOLPHUS Q What are you A A furrier—that is what I served my time to with my father—I have been out of my time seven years—I have been working at my trade a little since—for about four years—I get my living by purchasing skins of collectors and very likely I might cry rabbit-skins by purchasing skins of collectors and very likely I came to lodge at Jackinson s house three weeks ago last Monday evening—the 23rd of November was my first night to Jackson s about one o clock in Rose-lane Spitalfields before—I came to Jackson s about one o clock in the day—I knew him before—I had been there the week before an bought skins of him—I have dealt with him for two years—I am confident no cart came up at eleven o clock—I do not know whether I went to sleep at twelve o clock—It might be after that—It was about midnights—I knew O Neil and his wife before—I did not know Gollocker and his wife till I came to Jackson s—they were there before me—when I got up next morning I went about the yard and places I went out of doors immediately I came down stairs—I went out about my business rather before nine—I was in and out all day almost—Jackson has one male servant I cannot tell his name JAMES GOLLOCKER I am an umbrella maker On the 23rd of November I lodged at Mr Jackson s and have lodged there about six weeks—I have a wife and child—I went to bed about half-past nine o clock on Monday the 23rd of November—my room was on the first floor—there were four beds in the room—Mr and Mrs O Neil slept in the same room and Jones and two strangers slept in the same room that night—my child was very bad cutting her teeth—that kept me awake a good deal—I went to sleep about twelve o clock—I am certain I heard twelve strike before I went to sleep—Mrs O Neil did not leave her bed between my going to bad and twelve o clock—she went to bed at half-past eight—If she had got out of bed opened the window and talked to anybody I must have heard it—she must have come past the foot of my bed which is close to the window—I could put my hand on the window-still when I am in bed—I must have heard or seen her if she had gone down stairs—I got up next morning at half-past seven—I was down stairs I think before Jones—I did not hear her say anything that night or see any cart or hear her laugh with anybody after I got to bed Mr ADOLPHUS Q How long has Jones lodged there A He came there that Monday night I cannot say at what time he came—he is in the habit of bringing hare-skins—he came in the afternoon—It was late—not at mid-day—I never saw him there before—he lodges there still backwards and forwards—I was not in Court when Jones was examined—he has lodged there off and on to my knowledge—the first remark I made of my child s catting its teeth was on that Monday night—Jones was very bad on Monday—he said he had a kind of a belly-ache and some sort of a tooth-ache—he asked me for a piece of tobacco—I cannot say at what time he went to bed—he went down stairs twice—he was up stairs before me—I was in bed when he began to complain—I went to bed at half-past nine and I think in about an hour he began to complain and went down and came up in about a quarter of an hour—and went down again in about half an hour—that was nearly eleven o clock—I saw the O Neils come up I saw the old woman stagger against the drawers—she was intoxicated—I did not see the prisoner next morning—he kept a servant I cannot tell his name—he is in the prisoner s service now—he is not here James Ely a carpenter and builder of Greenwich —Perkins a porkbutcher Thomas Garrett grocer New-town Deptford and

t18360201-437  437 JAMES COLLINS was indicted for feloniously receiving of an evil disposed person on the 19th of January 360lbs value 60l the goods of Thomas Newen well knowing the same to have been feloniously stolen against the Statute &c THOMAS NEWEN My warehouse is at No 73 Aldersgate-street I do not live there—it was broken open a short time since and we lost a quantity of dressed leather about 60l in value—this examining some leather is part of what we lost—I can swear to the whole of it—I lost about 3 cwt Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q When did you miss it A On Monday the 4th of January—I cannot say whether it was stolen on Saturday night or Sunday—it was safe on the Saturday—I saw some of it again about a fortnight afterwards—there was time for it to have gone through several hands JAMES TRODD I am porter to Mr Newen I locked up the warehouse safe Saturday evening and on the Monday found it had been broken and the leather gone—I can speak to the identity of the leather JAMES PAGE I live at No 229 Kent-street Borough and am a shoemaker On Saturday the 16th of January I was in Newgate-market and met the prisoner Collins about two o clock—I I have known him for the last six or seven years—but I had not seen him before for eight or nine months—he said I wanted to see you I was coming over this afternoon or on Monday morning to see you —I said What do you want —he said I have got some goods to sell that I think will suit you —he is a sadler and buys up old harness and takes it into the country and sells it—he lived in the Borough-road four or five years ago—I asked him what goods they were—he said Some calf butts and there is some what they call kip butts and some what they call kip gray—are you a buyer —I said It depends upon the figure —he said You can have them at your own price or at any rate 1s or 1s per lb less than the cost prices—at what time will you be home —I said I should be home about four o clock—he said I will be over about four o clock at your house —I left him there—I went was a man with me who has the care of a shop of mine—I went home and waited till four o clock—he did not come—I went out about half-past four o clock and met him coming—we walked home together and when we got home he pulled one calf butt out of his pocket tied up in a handkerchief as a sample—I said You told me you had got some kip butts and kip grays —he said The kip butts are sold here is the sample kip butts and kip grays —but it was not kip grays—I asked him what he wanted for the calf butts and how many there were—he said six dozen and they were worth 3s per lb —I said They are not worth that to me—I can t give more than 2s —he said We can t take that for them —he was going to take it away—I said You may as well leave that with me—I will cut it up and If it turns out better than I think it will if you come over on Monday morning I may be able to give you a little more —he said I can t leave it with you —I said Well but we will weight it and I will pay you it at the rate of 3s per lb the price you ask and I will cut it up before you come over on Monday morning —I sent my son out to get it weighted—it weighed 1 lb 6 1/2s —I gave him 4s 3d for it—he he then went away and took with him the cordovan shank which he called kip gray—on Monday he came over again about twelve o clock—he then pulled out of the kip butts which he told me on Saturday were sold ——I looked at it and saw the mark was nearly taken out but I could see where it had been—I said You told me on Saturday these were sold —he said I thought they were —I then asked what he wanted for them—he said We think they are worth as much as the calf butts —I said they were not—I would give from 20d to or 22d per lb —he said will you give any more for the calf butts —I said I could not give more than 2s —he said What will you give for the kip grays —will you give 1s 6d per lb —I said Yes I will give 1s 6d per lb for that —this was about 12 o clock—he was to come again on Monday evening at eight o clock—I was at home till eight o clock but he did not come I went over to the public house and left word that I was over the way at the Artichoke—he came about half-past eight o clock—I heard him ask the landlady for me—I went out and asked him to come into the parlour—he said I have got a female with me I can t —I said Ask her in —he came in with the female and sat in the parlour—he said Well you are to have the kip butts at your own price whish was from 20d and you are to have thirteen of the calf butts at your price which was 2s per lb and you are to have the kip gray at 1s 6d —he said there might be from 30 to 40lbs weight of it—I said Well but Collins you told me there were six dozen of the calf butts and now you tell me there are thirteen—I suppose you have picked out the worst of them —he said No that is not it when you have got these and we find it is all right you will have the remainder —we sat there talking and he said If you and your son were to buy 60 or 70lbs of goods if they came in this way crossing his fingers you could cut them up in one night —I said Yes I dare say we could —he asked what time I should be home the next day—this was on Monday evening—the goods were not brought at this time—I forgot to mention that when he bought the kip butt as a sample I wished him to leave that in the same manner as he had the calf butt and said we would weigh it and I would pay him for it—he said so he would not leave that unless I would cut it up in his presence while he waited which I declined to do—on the Monday evening I asked him when he would bring the goods over—he said when would it suit me I said To-morrow at twelve o clock —and about half-past twelve o clock he came with a truck and another man drawing it—previous to that I had been over to Mr Newen who sent two officers with me and we put them in the Artichoke parlour till the prisoner and the man came with the goods—the truck was loaded up apparently with old traces and old chaise aprons—I had a customer in my shop who had come from the country—the prisoner said to me Who is that man —I said A customer of mine it is all right bring them in and he said directly You see I have brought this old harness — I had bought old traces of him before but not at that time —I told him to bring it in and he took it through the shop—the goods were done up in old harness and concealed—they were in three different parcels covered up in old leather—he took them through the shop into the room where I keep my leather—as soon as the leather was in I shut the door and said to Collins who was in the shop Come over the way and I will pay you and we went to the Artichoke—I had not undone the parcels not seen the inside of them—as soon as they came over the way I gave both the men in charge of the officers—I was present afterwards when the officers unpacked the parcels—this is a part of what was in the parcels—it has my mark on it Cross-examined Q Is your man here whom you say was present at one of these conversations A No—he overheard what was said and them he went into the market—Collins said all through this business We and I thought there were more persons concerned in it Q Did not tell the Magistrate that when he came to the public-house he told you that he had made a bargain for you for the leather A I think he did—I believe he did—the contents of the truck are have—it was broad daylight when the truck was brought—I do not know the man who came with the prisoner—I never saw him before—I believe his name was Brows I did not hear Collins say that a man offered him the leather for sale—I have known him from six to seven years—he had been a repairer of old harness—I always considered him an honest industrious man COURT Q You say he did at first say I have made a bargain for you A Yes I believe he did—the man who brought the leather said he was hired by him as a porter—Collins had told me to cut the marks out of all the heads as soon as I got them ROBERT TYRRELL I am an officer I went with another officer to the Artichoke public-house—we waited there about half an hour—the prisoner came with another person and page said These are the men I give them into custody —I searched Collins and asked him where he lived—he said In the City —I said the City was a large place whereabouts there —he said again The City —I said If you do not choose to tell me I shall not ask you any more —he then said he lived in Gunpowder alley Shoe-lane No 10 or 9—I then said it was my duty to ask him how he came in possession of this leather—he said a man had met him on the Thursday previous as he was coming out his house about the middle of the day and asked him if he dealt in harness and leather—he replied Yes —I asked him if he knew the man and where he lived—he said he did not know any thing about him—he had never seen him before to his knowledge—I asked the description of the man—he said A tall thin man —that he had got some leather to dispose of and he called on the Friday and brought him a skin and on the Saturday he brought the whole of the leather in a sort of chaise cart in two black bags—I said Would a man leave that quantity of leather with you without your knowing any thing at all about him —he said He did leave it —I took the men and the leather in a hackney-coach to Guildhall and then went and searched the prisoner s house in Gunpowder-alley and in the upper room I found two calf butts in this handkerchief two black bags and a great deal of old harness leather which we did not meddle with—the other prisoner was discharged—I found this chisel which corresponded with the marks on the desk which was broken open in the prosecutor s ware house but it was in a place where the prisoner works with these tools and he being indicted for receiving I did not mention this—this is a common piece of iron and the other seems a sort of screw-driver—these were not by themselves but tucked in a piece of leather by the side of the window where there were awls and things of his trade Cross-examined Q Did not he tell you that the man had brought them in two black bags A Yes and we found these two bags—I did not mention about the chisels because I thought it did not allude to this the man being indicted for receiving but that evidence would not have done alone because many chisels would have agreed with the marks—he gave me his address correctly—I asked him when he said the leather came in two black bags why he had not brought it in the bags rather than take in out and put it in leather—he then said he had brought some harness for Mr Warren who he said did not know it was coming but he was going to see if he would have it—the harness would cover the leather better than the bags—this is one of the bags—it would cover leather COURT to JAS PAGE Q You stated he said he would not leave it unless you would cut it up in his presence did he give as a reason that it was not this A He said he could leave it—I said it could make no difference to the party—I considered there were one or two more—but I said If you had the money it can make no difference Prisoner s Defence what this man says is not correct—I told him it was not mine and if I left they night think I was going to do something wrong—but I said I would bring the calf-skins and two kip-skins—I told him I did not know one from the other—I told him if he could do any good with if I would wait while he cut it up—but as to his saying I would not leave without his cutting it up it is as false as any thing can be—there is not a man better known in London than I am—I go about with goods on my shoulder or in a cart and deal with respectable persons MR NEWEN re-examined I have looked at these two butts of calfskins found in his house—the marks are partly robbed out but I have no doubt they are mine JURY Q What is the price of these calf butts A About 4s per lb the kip-butts are worth about 2s 6d the kip greys about 2s Prisoner When I met Mr Page I told him it was brought to me but I did not know calf-skins from kip—as for cutting parts off the leather I never mentioned a word about it—as for the old harness it is old leather JAMES PAGE I said to him on Monday evening I suppose it is a bankrupt s stock —he said Yes it is —he said he did not know what the leather was ROBERT TYRRELL He said he had not bought it but the man had left the leather with him in the two bags and the man was to call in the evening for money GUILTY Aged 34 — Transported for Fourteen Years

pins are mine too and told the officers they must search the premises and under the counter they found twelve or fourteen gross of reel cotton which I knew to be mine—they were concealed—after these were found and I identified them there were some tapes found on the shelf which we have the manufacture of but they are imitated by almost every one in the trade—the prisoner said These tapes cannot be yours because I brought them of another person —I could not swear to them—after the property was found in the shop the officer asked Leach if he had got any more—he said No —the officers said Well

the money—he said You may as well pledge them in the name of Moore and knowing his father to be a respectable man who lives independently I pledged them for him and gave him the money I afterwards purchased the duplicates of him and gave him 4s 6d for them—I believe the amount I pledged the things for was 1l 4s —I left the man after that and went to Mr Board s with one—I should say he refused it saying it might lie by him for a length of time—I then took it to Mr Cassell s where I was first apprehended—the policeman asked how I came by those tickets—I told him I bought them—from there he took me to Mr Boards and from there to the station-house—I pulled them out of my pocket though he says he took them from me—I have been in the habit of purchasing things which I have disposed of—I

thing more of him till my wife came down and told me that the man had been apprehended and examined at Worship-street and they let him go again—as to my knowing the things came through a dishonest

Day—Kentish asked Curnell to state to Day what he had stated to us—Curnell then said that he had been employed to Day to kill these lambs and that Day had given him orders to sell them and to make the beat he could of them—Day denied it and said he knew nothing of any lambs and he never had any lambs in his possession—Curnell said Good God do you mean to say that I can bring the publican to prove that you called me our of the house and the party that recommended me to you —Day said I know nothing of any lams —Kentish said You must go with me —Day said Stop a bit can t it be compromised —and be asked me the value of the lambs—I said the value was not so much as the depredation—he said again Could it not be compromised —I said they were worth 9l or 10l—but I would give 100l rather than I would not proceed and get the thieves—we then went to the Compter and he was taken an account of—as we were coming out Kentish said Have you anything to say to me —Day then called me aside and said I will tell you where I got them from—of the ostler at the king Harry s Head Mile-end-road —he did not tell me what he gave for them—on Friday the 29th of April I had a number of lambs—among the rest six which I missed on the Saturday night—when I send the lambs to market I always have them marked and two of these lambs had been sent to market and returned not being fat enough—I had seen these two lambs marked and assisted in marking them—on Monday morning I came to town and after going to two butchers and seeing some carcasses I went to Curnell s house and under the stairs found six skins amongst which were the skins of the two lambs which were marked Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Do you know Old-street-road A That is nine or ten miles from Chigwell—we traced this matter to the ostler at the king Harry s head—we are not enabled to trace the matter to some one at Chigwell—my object was to find out the thieves—Day gave me information by which I got some further information from Stiles JOHN BENJAMIN KENTISH I am a beadle of Newgate-market I went to Curnell s and saw the skins there—I then went to Day s residence in Old-street-road—on our road from his house to Curnell s I asked him if he had employed Harry the butcher to kill any lambs for him—he replied that he had not—I then told him that some lambs which had been stolen had been taken to Newgate-market that morning—they had been traced to Curnell s in whose possession the skins were found and that he had stated he was employed by Mr Day—Day said he had not employed him and he knew nothing of any lambs whatever—on our arrival at Curnell s and I asked him if Day was the man that employed him—he said he was the man—Day denied that he had done so and again repeated that he knew nothing about any lambs—I told Curnell and Day that they must both go with me to the Compter—upon which Day said Stop a bit can t we settle it —Mr Walton said he would not settle it he was determined to find our the

John—I told him I understood that he had gone up the road on horseback—he made no reply but walked directly through the house into the stable-yard—I went into the front entrance of the yard and saw the prisoner conversing with another man—I then asked the prisoner if his own name was not John and whether he was not the ostler there—he replied Yes—I said Why did you not tell me so when I spoke to you in the front of the house —I asked him if he had disposed of any lambs to any person with in the last few days—he replied that he had not—I asked him if he had sold any to a man named Day—he replied he had not and he did not know any thing about any lambs whatever—during this conversation Mr Walton came up—I said This is John Mr Walton —I then told the prisoner what some lambs had been stolen from that gentleman and that I had traced them to a man of the name of Day who said that he had bought them of him—he replied I know nothing at all about them —I took him into the house to his master and told his master I was going to take his ostler to Town on suspicion of receiving stolen lambs—the master replied What s that to me I told him that—I acquainted him through courtesy that his business should suffer no neglect—he then said to the prisoner John if you have had any dealings with any lambs confess the truth —I told the prisoner that whatever he might say I should give in evidence against him—he then said that the had them left by Mr Mason s wagoner early on Saturday morning who told him that he was to do the best he could with them—Mr Walton had put some questions to the prisoner—the public-house is in the direct road from Chigwell to Town Cross-examined Q At what part of this conversation was it that Mr Walton came in A During the time that I was asking the

weave from Mr Bamber—I afterwards received seventy-bobbins of shute to weave into that warp—I received four lengthening bobbins—we have silk on them to mend any breaking in the warp—I did not know any thing at the time of this shute being taken away from my place—I missed it about a fortnight after it was gone—it was then discovered that it had been stolen—I told what Sturgin told me—I was then taken into custody—thirty-nine bobbins were gone which are worth 2l 4s JOSEPH SIVRGIN a prisoner I was living with Allen in Virginia-row I gave been committed to prison on this matter—I remember Allen being taken into custody—I had been taken before—I told Mr Emerson foreman at first that I did not know what had become of this silk—I afterwards told Mr Gascoyne but it had been found out before that—it had not been found out before I told Allen—I sold the silk to the prisoner—I told the policeman as near as I could where he lived—I do not know the name of the street—I sold him forty-five bobbins about 28oz of silk—he gave me 7d an ounce—I was very badly off on the Saturday night and had no victuals to eat—we went to the prisoner I waited down stairs while a young man went up who went

and took eleven more bobbins—he paid me for 60z at 7d an ounce that was 3s 6d —I took eight bobbins at first—I got back the bibbins which I took on Saturday—they were in a basket which had twenty or thirty more in it—he gave me the eight the first time and every time after I had to pick them out of the basket—I remember leaving one bobbin that was a lengthening bobbin—the colour of this silk was Adelaide—I went five or Six times in the sane way and always saw him—he paid me 7d an ounce—the lower part of the house is a broker s shop and I went up-stairs to to the place—I told the officer what sort of place the first floor was Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q What did you do with the bobbins when you got them back A I took them home and put then in the cellar not that they might be used again but for me to take up-stairs when I had opportunities—I intended to get more silk on them when my work was done—I should have purchased silk myself and had it wound upon them—my intention was to purchase silk to substitute for this I had disposed of when my own work was done—this was Mr Emerson s silk—it had been delivered to Eliza Allen—it was not my intention to steal it—I stated in my depositions that I took thirty-five bobbins altogether but since I have recollected ten more—I was taken up about five or six days after it was all over and then I stated where I had taken it to—I am twenty-two years old—I have been a weaver ever since I was ten years old—I worked for Mr Emerson and so did Eliza Allen—we were living together as man and wife—she fetched the silk herself—it was not with her knowledge that I made this use of it—I first communicated it to her on the Saturday as I was taken on the Friday after—I told her on the Saturday on which I took the last ten bobbins and I was taken on the Friday afterwards—from what I ran recollect I took 28oz in all—when the silk is on the bobbins the bobbins and silk are weighed together and when the silk is wound off then the empty bobbins are weighed COURT Q Did you weigh the bobbins A I weighed them the last time hut one because there was one quarter of an ounce coming to me MR BODKIS Q Did Gorman know that you were a working weaver A Yes all the bobbins I took had the manufacturer s name on them—any body could have seen at once whose they were—I asked the prisoner what I could have such silk for an ounce again—he said from 10d to 1s —if it had been 2s 6d an ounce I had no means of getting it again MR CHAMBERS Q Them the manufacturer s name being on the bobbins you could easily pick them out A Yes I took forty-five bobbins and I took back forty-four—I forgot that one—I first took eight—the second time I took eleven and took back ten—I recollected it afterwards—it is not likely that I left any others—I left one which was a lengthening bobbin—it was not so much consequence to me as the others were and I forgot it—I remembered it the day after I went home—when I went home I had the number written down on my loom-post—I took the eleven on Tuesday and to ok them back on Thursday JOHN BAMBER I am foreman to Mr William Emerson a silk manufacturer living in Spital-square On the 10th of March I delivered to

consequence of that I went to the prisoner s house with the officer on the 9th of April—we found him at home—it is what we term a loombroker s shop down below—I saw no articles of furniture for sale—a loombroker must necessarily be acquainted with the weaving trade—his house is in the neighbourhood where the weavers live—we told him what we came for—he said he had no objection at all to out searching—we went up-stairs and saw a quantity of rolls ticketed which had no warp upon them—we searched about the place and sixty-six empty bobbins were found belonging to out factory with the name of Worland on them which was a stock that Mr Emerson had purchased—I found a lengthening bobbin—it had Adelaide silk on it—I found some white silk on a bobbin with Worland on it—the shop bobbins had been died black in July and were rather remarkable—he said he bought the lengthening bobbins that had the Adelaid silk on them with some other brokering things—I think he said a plush-box—I think he said he might have had it two years—I am sure he represented that he had had it some time—he was then taken Cross-examined Q What is plush-box A A box in which they put velvet after it is manufactured—I think this Adelaide colour came up about two years ago—I know the prisoner deals in bobbins—Mr Worland has given up business and Mr Emerson bought his stock—it may happen in an extensive business that the bobbins may remain unreturned occasionally—there may be an omission of one bobbin a lengthening one more particularly—it is impossible to say how many hundred bobbins I have given out—the prisoner afforded me every facility in searching—he went and brought a ladder when I asked if there was a loft for the purpose of my ascending it—I do not recollect the officer saying after we had searched We have not found the shute we came after nor his saying That will do —I heard that they let the prisoner go after he was taken up MR BODKIN Q Did he tell you he dealt in bobbins A He told me he had bought a quantity of bobbins JAMES HANLEY I am an officer I went with the witness to the prisoner s house he was at home—I had not a description of the place from Sturgin—I went with a search warrant in consequence of information from Mr Gascoyne and the policeman and brought away altogether sixty-seven bobbins—this is the lengthening bobbin that has the silk on it and this one has a bit of white—I found them up-stairs in the first-floor room of the prisoner s house—I asked him to account for the thirty-five bobbins—he said he bought some of one and some of another—Mr Gascoyne said I believe this Adelaide to be out silk —and looked at it—the prisoner made no remark about that Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q You found every facility in searching this place A yes—I found them after I had been there five minutes JOHN BAMBER re-examined These bobbins are Mr Emersun s—this one with the Adelaide silk on it I should say from its general appearance is one that I gave out—the name of Worland is on it—Mr Emerson purchased the whole of Mr Worland—I could not swear that the Adelaide silk I gave out was of the same kind and colour as this—these black bobbins I can swear positively to—here is one with a little Adelaide silk on it which is not ours—these other two were brought from Sturgin s house Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Have you not reason to believe that there are thousands of bobbins of this colour A Yes—I will not swear Mr Wouland had not sold bobbins some months before he sold them to my master MR BODKIN Q Are these bobbins sold in small quantities A No not in general ELIZABETH ALLEN re-examined This bobbin is one I received from Mr Emerson—it has the name of Worland on it—I did not notice the name at the time I received it—I judge from the colour and size of the bobbin—I had four lengthening bobbins and two I am short of ROBERT BAYLIS I am clerk to the magistrate at Worship-street When the prisoner was under examination he made a statement which I took down correctly—this is it Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Did you take it at the time he made the statement A Yes—it was read over to him and he signed it—he was asked if he had any thing to add—the magistrate was not present during the whole of the time—he was when it was read over— reads — I never saw the witness Sturgin before I saw him in custody at this office when Mr Hanley brought him out of the lock-up-place and asked me if I knew him—I never bought shute or warp of him MR DONE Q Did you not hear the prisoner state that he bought and sold bobbins in the way of business A Yes he stated that he used to buy weavers apparatus and there were bobbins among them Prisoner s Defence Sturgin himself denied at the office that the bobbins were ever his which had the Adelaide silk on—I bought a lot of things at a weaver s and in them was a plush-box and these bobbins were in it—I never exhibited them for sale—I gave every facility to them when they came—when they came into the chamber where the bobbins were Mr Banley said You have not found the property you came after —Mr Gascoyne said No —I said there were some more bobbins down stairs I took them down and showed them to them and they found two—they then said had I a loft—I said Yes —they went up-stairs—I got a ladder—Mr Gascoyne went up to search but found nothing—he then came down and said I must go with them to Worship-street and then they seemed to own the bobbins but never matched the silk while I was there which I said I thought they ought because they might see whether they were alike—I said it was full six months before that I had bought this lot of weavers apparatus where the bobbins were—after the examination I was allowed to go home—to appear on the Monday when I went and was put in a room with an officer Mr Vann—he said You are right enough they have not got a little against you —I said I do not know but I have come honestly by the bobbins I did not buy them to get profit by nor did I offer them for sale —the silk is no use to me at all and the bobbins were in the basket with others—I allowed them to take them all away JURY to JOSEPH STURGIN Q As far as you can judge do you believe that bobbin with the Adelaide silk on is the one you sold the prisoner A The bobbin is not—the silk I believe is the same—this other is the bobbin that I missed COURT Q Who introduced you to this man A A man who bought and sold silk thrums about the streets—I do not know where he is now—he told me he was going into the hospital—he gave me the name of Peter Lucas JAMES HANLEY I have seen after Lurss but I cannot find him—I have heard the name of Lucss in the silk-business Benjamin Richardson silk-weaver of Fuller-street Robert Entwintle a silk-weaver of 50 Hare-street Samuel Scott a

in hardware and an importer of foreign merchandise I live in Houndsditch and am in partnership with my brother Alfred—I have employed Manly Abrahams as errand boy for two or three years—while he was in our service we missed a variety of articles of various sorts of jewellery—more particularly one parcel which was completely stolen—I have an invoice of it in my pocket—they we coral and jet ear-rings and pins—I missed this on the 29th of August Abrahams being still in my service—in consequence of something I heard I went to the premises of the prisoner Silkman with my brother two policemen and the boy—the parties who gave us information told us where he lived—we saw him and searched his premises and found a variety of articles and jewellery the things mentioned in the indictment in I which I knew to be mine—the prisoner keeps a lodging house—I believe there were two or three persons lodging in the same house—we found the things in the prisoner s room—I believe he had but one room—part of these things were in his box with which he used to hawk in trade I sup pose and part in a chest of drawers—I recognise the greater part of an I these articles as being exactly similar to some I have missed—here is one that has my mark on it a mock pearl set of ear-rings and a brooch—the mark is on the box—if these were sold the box would be sold with them—I found some seals—they corresponded in every respect with a parcel of seals we had missed at the same time—we found a parcel of seals corresponding with what we found at Silkman s concealed in a secret part of our ware house to which Abrahams had access—it is a sort of stove in the upper ware house where we never kept any thing but bulky articles—there is a white mark at the bottom of this jet ear-ring—I noticed it when I purchased them and being curious to know what it was I broke a piece off—this I found at Silkman s in the parcel of ear-rings which were stolen in the talk—it had never been sold nor opened for sale and these ear-rings were in the parcel which was gone and found at the prisoner s—I have in my hand some more ear-rings belonging to a parcel we missed in bulk which has my mark made when I purchased them—they were found at Silkman s and a great variety of things which have never been sold and correspond in every respect with those we missed—Silkman said he bought them of Mr Sampson Mr Calisher and myself—I am quite certain I never sold him any of these things—I have seen him at the shop and he might have bought one or two brooches which is the extent that men of that sort ever buy—I know those people and have spoken with them—before I made this search at the prisoner s I had a communication from the boy Abrahams—we had a warehouse below in the under part of the premises where we kept very bulky things such as foreign toys totally different to things of this description—the greater part of these things were kept in a cupboard in the counting-house—none of them had been in the cellars below—I took one parcel out of my portmanteau and placed it on a counter in the warehouse—it was missed the same day—they were coral ear-rings jet ear-rings and pins which were not intended for sale—we had the boy taken up as well as the prisoner and upon advice we let the boy go before the Grand Jury Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How many shopmen have you A Four—we have eight or nine people altogether—the rest are porters packers and errand-boys—the shopmen used to sell—I cannot say bow long the prisoner has been in the habit of dealing at my shop—it may be one or two years—an immense number of people come to our place—neither of the gentlemen I have named come to buy of us—they are dealers themselves—it is the habit among the lower orders of our persuasion to buy of one another at coffee-houses—I was not always the person that served the prisoner—I believe him to be a hawker—the box I saw was of the kind Pedlars carry about MR ADOLPHUS Q You have been asked about this man being in the habit of dealing with you A He was an occasional purchaser but very seldom to my own knowledge—perhaps he may have been in the warehouse eight or ten times in the course of a year—I am always in the counting-house—though I do not always serve I know what men are in the habit of coming COURT Q How often have you been out of town to Birmingham and other places A About three times a year sometimes usually for a week sometimes for a fortnight MANLY ABRAHAMS I am thirteen years of age and am a Jew I was in the service of a grocer named Joseph for two years—it is about two years and a half since I left him—he lived at No 14 Bury-street while there I became acquainted with a Turkish Jew named David—in consequence of what he said I took a piece of gum of Mr Joseph s and gave to him—he did not induce me to take any thing more I took things after I came to Mr Davis—David said to me If you don t bring me more things I will tell your master of your taking the gum and he won t give you a character —that was when I was going from Joseph to Mr Davis—after I had been at Mr Davis s six weeks or two months I saw the prisoner at the beginning of Duke-street Aldgate walking about—he said You may as well bring me some things as you brought to David my countryman and if you don t bring me some things I shall tell your master —I did not know where Silkman lived before that—he showed me his house in Duke-street Aldgate—in consequence of that I took first a paper of plated ear-rings—I do not know how many pairs there were—it was a good sized paper—he gave me 6d and told me to bring him some other things—about two days after I took him a paper of black ear-rings—I do not know how many there were—they were black glass—I took them from boxes in master s stock he gave me 6d again—I saw him again and took him a paper of common seals—he then gave me 1s —all the things I took were part of my master s stock—I then told him how I got at them and said I was very much frightened—he said Never mind don t be frightened —then I took him a paper of another sort of seals and I believe he gave me 6d or 1s —this was about six weeks or two months after I got to my master s—this went on from day to day and week to week constantly—among the things I took were some jet ear-rings and coral in a paper parcel—I took that from a back board at the bottom of the shop—I do not know who placed it there—my master had been out of town a little before I took it about a week—there was nothing in the parcel besides the coral and the jet—the paper was opened—I opened it when I took it to Silkman—my master had then lately returned from the country—the prisoner gave me 6d for that—I had made a hole through a passage into the cellar where goods were kept out of the place where I cleaned shoes and knives—I got the things by that means—I told Silkman of that—I took things on these occasions and handed them to the prisoner—these transactions between me and the prisoner went on for about a year and a half—the hole I made was through a partition out of one cellar into another COURT Q Was that made before the jet ear-rings were taken or after A After that MR ADOLPHUS Q What did you say to the prisoner A I told him I was very much frightened to go through the hole—he said Never mind shut it up this week and go to it next week —f followed his advice—I always let him know where 1 got the goods from—after that some information was given and I was found out—I had been in custody before I told—I said I took half-a-dozen seals—I was taken to the Computer and then I told all about it—Silkman was then in custody—I have been since detained in Newgate—there are none of the black jet and coral ear-rings here now Cross-examined Q Can you tell in what month you took these black and coral ear-rings A I cannot tell nor in what year—I think it was 1837—I remember that perfectly now—I did not hear the words you said—I was not thinking of it—I do not know the month—it was about three or four months back that my master came from the country—he went to Birmingham and Sheffield—the ear-rings were in a paper parcel—there was no mark on the paper of any kind that I ever saw—I was about twelve years old when I began with my former master—it is a year and nine months since I first began to rob any body—I was in Joseph s employ about two years and a half—I was about a week out of Joseph s employ before I came to Davis—it was a small piece of white gum that I took—I was two years in his employ before I stole that—I was about a year and a half in Davis s employ before I stole the jet and coral ear-rings—they were the last things I took and that was about three or four months ago—I took nothing else but the coral and jet ear-rings in the lasts two months—I remained in his service a fortnight after taking them—I could not say exactly how long ago it was—I did not ask Mr Josephs for a character—I ran away from him—he used to hit me too hard—I was not found out stealing—I do not know what I was hit for—he never accused me of stealing any thing that I am aware of—he never told me any thing about it nor anybody else that I know of—I do not know whether he told me that he thought I was robbing him and beat me—I believe he owed me a week s wages when I ran away—David used to give me 6d every time I gave him any thing and then I would not take him any more—I took him things about once or twice a week for a month from Davis—the gum was the first—I never took him any thing but the gum from Josephs—I took a paper of ear-rings first from Davis—I used to take him some black ear-rings sometimes and seals—I do not think I took him any thing else—he used to ask me but I never did—he did not ask for any particular thing—I got through the hole to take away things from the shop—I made a hole through the cellar and could get into the shop—the cellar was under ground—I could not get in in front—there was a pair of steps in the cellar and I got up that way through a trap door—I got from one cellar into the adjoining one where I got into the warehouse and took them from the stock—I was taken into custody before I said a word about this—I was not brought to the Justice before I told—I was at the watch-house—Silkman was taken a little while after me—I had told before he was taken that I took half a dozen seals—I have not said that Silkman was taken into custody before I said any thing MR ADOLPHUS Q Do you count by Christian months A Yes—when I got out of the shoe-cellar into the stock-cellar I could go into the ware house—there was no necessity for breaking through the floor—I did that early in the morning before the shop was open—David first set me on to thieving and then Silkman—Silkman was taken about a quarter of an hour after I was—I said I had taken half a en seals before I saw Silkman JOHN DAVIS re-examined Q Is this the invoice of a parcel you brought from Birmingham A Yes one parcel of black and jet ear-rings—I took it out my portmanteau and laid it on a board and the whole parcel was missing the next day—they were charged to me at 9l 12s —I had a partition in my cellar where a hole was made through and from that cellar a person could go to the warehouse by a flight of steps—the goods in the cellar were common toys—it was from information I received that I had Silkman taken Cross-examined When did you go from town A About the 12th or 14th of August—I staid about eight days—I went to no place but Birmingham—that would bring it near to September—I brought a portion of the goods I bought—I took out these jet and coral ear-rings one or two days after my return—I missed them the day I took them out—I do not know whether there was any mark on the paper in which these jet and coral ear-rings were deposited—I rather think there was but I am not certain on the subject—this ear-ring has a mark on the bottom of it—in my opinion that is not I dirt—I broke a small piece off at the bottom—five dozen pairs of ear-rings were in that paper altogether with coral pins and coral ear-rings—I am sure there were coral pins—there were two dozen MR PHILLIPS to MANLY ABRAHAMS Q Was there any thing else in the brown paper parcel but coral ear-rings A I did not see any thing else—I did not examine it particularly—I just opened it and then I was obliged to go back again—I tore off a piece of paper from each side CAROLINE STANLEY I was in the service of Mr Davis—I remember Abraham s being there—I know the cellar where he cleaned shoes and the knives—I remember the next cellar—I saw him there once at half-past six o clock in the morning about five months ago—he went down our cellar stairs—there was half the board open and he stooped down and went through that opening Cross-examined Q Were you before the Magistrate A No—I came into Mr Davis s service five months and a fortnight ago—I went down one morning and could not find him—this hole was open—I said nothing—I thought I would watch him—the next morning 1 went down this place was opened and he was there—I said What the devil do you do there —he said Oh Ann I have been to hunt the black cats —there were no black cats that I know of—I mentioned it to my mistress a week or ten days after and my mistress mentioned it to my master and he had it fastened up—this was five months ago about a fortnight after I was there—it remained open a week or ten days—I had never seen any black cats there then—I have since—I did not suspect he was doing wrong—I thought it was a child s action MR ADOLPHUS Q You went about two months and two weeks ago A Yes—I had been in the service nearly a week when I saw this or nine days—there might have been black cats there though I had not seen them CHARLES SMITH I am in Mr Davis s service I found a parcel on the 26th of September before the boy was in custody—it was in a stove—I only took out one parcel—that was a parcel of seals ALMO SHEENO I am the secretary of the synagogue and distribute alms The prisoner was an applicant for alms during the last two years occasionally—he has had perhaps about 40s in a year—20s to get his licence and during the year perhaps 20s on application for relief—I heard of his being taken into custody—he had money for a licence in July or August Cross-examined Q Do not you find yourself sometimes deceived in these applications A Certainly—I have found that people that do not want money will come and make a poor mouth and get it—I should no have assisted the prisoner if I had not thought him an honest fair man MR ADOLPHUS Q Do you take pains to know something of every man who applies for relief A We do not make any particular inquiry—we judge by their aspect and appearance—I never knew that the prisoner had jewels and property of great value by him—the smallest sum he has received was 5s —his wife has received it—it was in his name JAMES MARTIN I am a City police-constable I assisted in searching the prisoner s premises at 18 Duke-street Aldgate and found all these things in the second floor front room—they were in the drawers except those in the box—the others were scattered about the chest of drawers—Abrahams was with me—he did not point out the things—he pointed out the prisoner Cross-examined Q These things you found in his room A Yes—this is a usual pedlar s box—I had no difficulty in finding the things MR ADOLPHUS Q How many drawers were there A Three or four with two small top drawers—two had got wearing apparel I think in them MR ADOLPHUS to JOHN DAVIS Q Have you looked over the things found A I have—the value of the whole is I think from 30l to 40l MR PHILLIPS to MANLY ABRAHAMS Q How long did you keep that hole in the cellar open A About three weeks—I closed it up for fear my master should find it—I opened it occasionally as I wanted—I always closed it myself the last time as well as the first—I never left it open at all - - Jackson of Crown-street Moses Benjamin a

t18380226-808  808 JAMES RIDGWAY was indicted for feloniously receiving of an evil-disposed person on the 20th of January 100lbs weight of silk value 140l the goods of Edward Fellowes well knowing it to have been stolen MR SERGEANT ANDREWS and MR CHAMBERS conducted the prosecution WILLIAM FISHER The first part of this witness evidence in the former case relating to the state of the premises on the night of the robbery &c was read to him which he confirmed Q Did you go on Sunday the 28th of January to No 3 Foster-lane A I did and there saw a truss of silk—Herdsfield showed it to me—I examined it—there was about 48lbs —it was part of what had been stoles—it was Italian tram silk—on the following Tuesday the 30th of January I set off for Macclesfield and went with Stock win and officer to the house of one Hooley and in consequence of what I heard there I went to Pick-ford s ware house at Macclesfield and there found another truss of silk containing rather better than 50lbs of Italian tram—that formed part of the quantity stolen on the 15th of January—the two parcels together were rather better than 100lbs —I saw the mode in which the parcels of silk were put together—the original cords had been taken off and others used in their place—they were in larger bundles than the last and not quite so square Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q What day was the prisoner taken into custody A On Saturday the 27th of January and on the 30th I went to Macclesfield and took Hooley into custody and brought him to town—he attended at the Mansion-house—I believe he was in custody when he went there but I did not see him go there—the Macclesfield officer brought him to town and took him to the Compter Q Did not you see him attended by Counsel at the Mansion-house at a prisoner A No he was not a prisoner that I know of—I saw two persons named Sherman in custody for this offence—I believe I remained all the while at the office—I do not know whether the Shermans were examined as witnesses—it was a man and his son—the boy was not a witless—I do not recollect seeing the boy sworn that day nor on any day—I do not believe the father was present when the boy was—I saw him afterwards THOMAS THEOBALDS I am a City Marshal On the 27th of February I went to make a search at Bailey s house at No 57 Grey Eagle-street—it was about six o clock in the evening—the prisoner came in there and he spoke to a female and asked to see Bailey Q Did you hear his name mentioned A The woman mentioned his name—she said Ridgway here is a pretty mess —I asked him if he bad seen Bailey that day—he said he had not—I asked him if he had any dealings in silk with Bailey—he said he had not—I think I asked him if he had any silk to dispose of and he also said he had not—I asked him for his address—he said in Grantham-place—I asked tint some time after where Grantham-place was—at last he said it was at Hoxton and he also gave me his own address No 3 Foster-lane —I asked him if he had any place of business there—he said he had not—I asked him if he had any drawers or counters or any place there—he said no he had not he was merely an agent for Mr Mills and Mr Henwood Q Do you know who occupies the house in Foster-lane A It is let out in counting-houses—Mr Hen wood has got a warehouse there—he was speaking of that Mr Henwood—I did not tell him he was my prisoner till after this conversation took place—I then told him he must be my prisoner—he said he was respectably known to Mr Peanall and to Mr Ram—while I was taking him down to the station-house in Spitalfields he asked me whether it was any thing relative to Mr Fellowes s robbery—I made no reply—I did not satisfy him on that point—on the following morning I went to No 3 Foster-lane with Herdsfield and saw Mr Henwood there—on my saying I had Ridgway s keys he showed me the beck attic at the top of the house—he opened it—I do not think it was locked—it was not furnished—it was merely fitted up with a scale and a kind of counter and board to put the weights on—there were no drawers—it was merely supported by a trestle—they were very large scales and weights corresponding—such scales as would weigh a pretty bulky quantity—there were eleven parcels of sewing-silks and some other silk on the ground which I brought away—that was a truss of silk with a card attached to it—it had been opened and sewn up— looking at it —this is the card—it was sewn on the canvas and was in this state when I took it off—I sent Herdsfield for Fisher and when he came he took out part of the silk and identified it—I gave the truss to Herdsfield and he brought it away—the house is near the church in Foster-lane very near Cheapside—the name of Ridgway was on the door-post next the street Cross-examined Q Was it not Grantham-terrace he said he lived at A Yes—I found that correct—I went to No 3 Foster-lane on the 28th—at that time the prisoner was in custody—this robbery had made considerable noise in the City—particularly among the silk people—large placards were posted all over the walls offering £200 reward from the 16th—it was perfectly notorious from the 16th that this robbery had been committed—I was at the Mansion-house when this case was gone into—I remember the two Shermans father and son being in charge—they were afterwards examined as witnesses and kept in custody to give evidence—they are in custody now MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q Were they examined against the prisoner or against others A Against others MR PHILLIPS Q Were there any others in custody A No—when they were examined there was nobody in custody but Ridgway and Bailey MR SERGEANT ANDREWS Q Were they examined in reference to any one person in particular A No—they were examined touching the robbery generally—Ridgway had not been committed then THOMAS HERDSFIELD I have some silk which I found at No 3 Foster-lane—this was the bale of silk which I showed to Fisher WILLIAM HENWOOD I am a warehouseman and live at No 3 Foster-lane I let the top back-room of my house to the prisoner—it is three stories high—he had had it not quite three months when he was apprehended—I never employed him in business—not as an agent nor in any way—he came to the apartment every day—he did not sleep there—I remember the Sunday when Mr Theobalds and Herdsfield came—the room I showed them was the apartment used by Ridgway—this appears to me to be the truss of silk found there Cross-examined Q When the prisoner left in the evening who did he leave the key with A He generally left it with me—he either locked it himself or left it unlocked—nobody could go into it after he left without our knowledge—I could go in of course Q Could not anybody else who had a warehouse in the same house go in A Not without somebody knowing it—only myself and Mr Mills have warehouses there—he never left the key with Mr Mills—he frequently left it with me—I did not do business in his room myself—I never deposited any goods there—I have a warehouse of my own on the second floor EDWARD APSLEY STOCKWIN I am an officer of the Macclesfield police On the 1st of February I went to the house of the witness Hooley there and in consequence of what he said to me I went to Pick-ford s warehouse and there found a truss of silk which I produce—it has been opened since I found it—when I found it there was a direction on it which I took off and produce—it is Mr Jas Ridgway to be left till called for —I took Hooley into custody before I found the bale when I first went to his house—I brought him up to town in custody Cross-examined Q Hooley was kept in custody a considerable time I believe A He was—I took him to the Mansion-house in custody and he was attended there by counsel—I took him there as a prisoner and after that he was examined as a witness ABRAHAM HOOLEY I live at Macclesfield I have known the prisoner ever since he was a boy—I was in London in October last and saw him then—I am a dealer in silk and silk-waste and I also follow the business of a tailor Q What passed between you and Ridgway in October about purchasing any thing A He said he had met with a friend who had advanced him a considerable sum of money and he should have silk to sell at times such as he could not use—that he was commencing manufacturing and should have silk which he could not use—I told him I should have no objection to take any thing that would do for me—I afterwards saw him in Macclesfield Q In January this year did you receive any thing from him A Yes—on the 18th of January a bundle of China and Italian silk came to me by the Defiance coach—I received a letter on the 25th—this is it— looking at one —I believe it is the prisoner s handwriting—I have seen him write a little—after six o clock that evening the package was delivered by the porter from the coach-office—when I opened it I found it contained Italian tram—I did not weigh it—I suppose it to be the weight stated in the letter 48lbs —I consider it about that quantity—I only examined it superficially—I then packed it up and re-directed it and sent it back about an hour and a-half or so after I got it—I sent it back by the Defiance coach which it came by—I believe this is the direction and the card I put on it when I returned it— looking at it —I sent a note inside the parcel addressed to Mr Ridgway—that letter did not explain why I sent it back—on the 30th another parcel came to me corresponding nearly in size with the other—it was packed in canvas like the other and addressed to me—I do not know the handwriting of the direction—I just merely opened the head of it—it was silk—I thought it was the same as I had returned come back again and I sent it to Pickford s van-office the same hour—I carried it to the office which is very near my house and supposing it came from Ridgway I just merely wrote on it Mr Ridgway till called for —this is the paper I wrote— looking at it —I sent it for the purpose of being at Pickford s when inquiry was made for it Q After this did you hear something about this from Stockwin s application to you A Yes—the bundles were brought to town and I was brought with them by Stockwin—I was examined at the Mansion House as a witness—I arrived in London on the Saturday evening and was detained till Monday at noon—I was released on Monday Cross-examined Q After being admitted as a witness you were allowed to leave town A Yes—I was first a prisoner on this charge—it was on the 30th I received the package which I thought was the same I had sent back—the first was on the 25th—I sent that back the same day—Maccles-field is 167 miles from town—I believe the card to be the direction I sent but I am not sure of it—I am a dealer in silk and silk-waste and also a tailor—I did not forget that when I said I was a dealer in silk and silk-waste—I had no motive for not naming it Q Pray Mr Hooley have you given us all your trades A Yes—all that I am now not all that I have been—I was a little in the cotton-waste and I had a little manufacturing of silk and I had a dyeing concern—nothing else—I was never a silk-weaver nor a trowster—I have been a class-leader among the Wcsleyans—I was never suspended for six months by them—I was never suspended at all—I understand the question—this was the first time I was ever taken into custody on any occasion—I was never taken into custody except on this occasion—I mean to swear that—nor was I ever suspended—I believe I have given you all my trades—I am quite sure of it—I swear I never was any trade except those I have mentioned—I was in partnership in the dyeing trade with one Pyett four or five years ago—I have not left the tailoring—I do not keep a tailor s shop—I carry on the business in my own house—I have a shop behind out of sight of the street—I have a room which I put the silk-waste in and the tailoring likewise—I have men under me Q Is anybody here to whom you gave the parcel directed to Mr Ridgeway till called for A No—I have been to Macclesfield since I was examined—I expected I should have had a letter or something from Ridgway and that was my reason for sending the parcel to Pickford s to be kept till called for JOHN BRAY I am porter at the Swan with Two Necks in Lad-lane I know No 3 Foster-lane—it is in my district for the delivery of parcels—I have driven my horse and cart up to the door with parcels for the prisoner—I recollect taking one there on the 27th of January—Mr Ridgeway s goods generally came by the Defiance coach—I do not know whether that package did so—I believe that package was taken into the house by James Smith the man who goes with the cart—I should know the direction again— looking at it —to the best of my knowledge that is the direction by the pencil mark on it—the package was a similar one to the one produced—the lad brought the ticket down signed for me to call again for the money JAMES SMITH I go with the cart driven by Bray to deliver parcels—I remember taking a package to Foster-lan —I do not recollect whether is was on Saturday—I did not get the money for it—I was to call again—the package was delivered at Ridgway s No 3 Foster-lane—I carried it myself up two pairs of stairs—not to the top of the house—the ticket was signed and given back to me and I gave it to Bray—this is something like the bale I took— looking at the one produced —I cannot tell whether it is the same Cross-examined Q Do you remember the day of the month that you took the parcel A No MR CHAMBERS to JOHN BRAY Q What time in the morning of the 27th did you deliver the parcel A As near as I can guess about half-past ten o clock EDWARD FELLOWES I am the owner of the silk lost I have examined the two parcels of silk the one from Pickford s and the other from Foster-lane—I have no doubt they are part of the silk which was stolen from me JOHN STEWART I am a clerk in the London and Westminster Bank One Ridgway kept an account there—I do not know the prisoner personify—I do not remember that I ever saw him Q Is that letter the one received by Hooley the handwriting of your customer Ridgway A I have paid cheques with the same signature this but I never saw the prisoner about them WILLIAM HENWOOD re-examined I know the prisoner s handwriting—this letter appears like his handwriting—I have seen his writing once or twice—it looks like his—I have seen his handwriting before—It appears to be his—I cannot say further COURT Q Have you any belief on the subject—have you seen him write A I have seen his writing but I have not seen him write—I have not corresponded with him Q How have you seen his writing A I have received from the hands of some person a letter from Mr Ridgway and the writing was so bad I cannot say positively whether it is the same—I have not seen enough of his handwriting to enable me to form a judgment about it—he has told me he kept his money at the London and Westminster Bank—I have had one or two cheques of his—I think I have received one from him—he has not told me at what branch of the bank he keeps his cash JAMES STEWART re-examined We have only one Ridgway banking with us in Throgmorton-street his name is James—we have five branches in town and I cannot tell whether he kept cash at any branch— The letter was here put in and read To Mr A Hooley Park-green Macclesfield —Dear Sir I now send you as under by Defiance coach

time and on Saturday the 17th of March I detected her in stealing some money—she left that evening and I watched her down to London-bridge to Tower-street Leadenhall-market and various other places—I believe she saw me—I at last traced her to a house in Blacksmith s Arms-place Whitechapel—I did not see her go into the house—I obtained information there which led me to No 8 Lower Chapman-street—I watched that house for several days day and night with assistance—on the Thursday I received information and went and watched there and in a short time the prisoner came home he went into the house came out again and walked up and down the street twice—he then went into the house again and brought out two wheels of a truck—he afterwards brought out the rest and made up the truck—he then sent his boy on with the truck into Anthony-street which is just by—he followed the boy there told him to take the truck up a lane and while he did so the prisoner went into No 5 Anthony-street—he remained in there about five minutes then came out walked up and down the street two or three times then beckoned the boy and the truck was taken to No 5 Anthony-street—the prisoner brought out two boxes placed them on the truck—he then took away the truck himself and went towards St Katharine s Docks—I spoke to Nicholas a policeman and we followed him to St Katharine s wharf—I saw him take the boxes into the wharf and he gave directions that they should be taken to Hull by the steam-boat—we asked him where he brought them from—he said Somewhere out of Anthony-street —we asked him what number—he said he was not certain but he thought it was No 5 or 6—we asked who they belonged to—he said To a woman named Ann Cook —I asked why there was no direction on the boxes—he said the woman was following him down and was going to direct them—they had no direction to them—I then gave him in charge and the policeman took possession of the boxes—the prisoner said he did not know the woman that he was merely engaged to bring down the trunks and she would pay him when she came down—we went to No 5 Anthony-street and saw a woman named Chason there—I inquired there about Starkie but did not find her by Chason s account—I saw her found in the privy of the adjoining house—I left her in charge of a policeman and went to No 2 Lower Chapman-street from where I had seen the truck brought—I saw some property there belonging to a Mr Browning—I there found a woman named Bell who has been convicted—she passed as the prisoner s wife—I gave her into custody—the prisoner said that the house No 2 Lower Chapman-street was his—I missed a great variety of articles belonging to myself and my guests while Starkie was in my employ JOHN NICHOLAS I am a policeman On Thursday afternoon the 22nd of March my attention was directed by the prosecutor to the truck which was drawn by the prisoner—I followed it to St Katharine steam wharf—he was about taking the boxes out and I asked Mm when he brought them from—he said from Anthony-street either No 5 or 6 he did not know which—I asked him why they were not directed—he said a young woman was following him down to direct them and they were going to Hull—he was then about telling the man on the wharf that a young woman was coming down who was going by the Hull steamer—they were asking him about their not being directed—I asked if he knew her name—he said he believed her name was Ann Cook he did not know any thing about her he was only employed as porter—I then took him into custody and took possession of the boxes—they were not locked but corded together and nailed down—I afterwards went to the house No 5 Anthony-street and made inquiry of Mrs Chason—she said she knew nothing about Starkie but I found her in the privy of the adjoining yard she could get to that from No 5 as the palings between the two yards were broken down—I knocked at the privy door several times but could get no answer—I forced it open and took her—Sarah Bell was brought to the house and we took her Starkie Chason and the prisoner to the station-house together—I asked Starkie for the keys of the boxes—she said she had no keys to them—I asked if they were locked—she said they were not—she treated them as hers ELIZABETH CHASON I am a laundress—I live at No 5 Anthony-street I know the prisoner slightly and also his wile and Starkie—Starkie passed as the prisoner s sister—I gave her leave to be at my house for a day or two as she said she wished to be screened from the anger of her husband—when the officers came and applied about her I denied her being there—I was with her in my parlour when the prosecutor went by the door and she said that was the gentleman she was so much afraid of—the prisoner had also asked me to let her stay there a day or two till she got a situation as her husband had found her out and would very much ill use her meaning that her husband had gone to her situation and obliged her to leave it —the prisoner had brought the boxes to my house on Sunday the 18th of March and they remained there till Thursday when he came and took them away—I did not hear what passed between him and Starkie except some allusion to her getting a situation and going away and they sometimes talked about going to Hull and different places to go out of the country to get away from her husband—she went by the name of Elizabeth Starkie at my house not by the name of Cook—I did not know any female there going by the name of Cook—when the prisoner came to take the boxes away I heard him going to make use of a desperate oath to her as he was rather in a passion and I told him not to swear in my place—he said she had cost him many pounds and was likely to cost him many more—I believe she called him Bell—I never heard him call her any thing particular—he called her his sister—I had known them about six months—they kept a mangle and I gave my mangling to them—when Starkie wished me to deny her she went out into the back yard

in what way the things came to my house and who they belong to—you have no right to bring any more into It than are really guilty—he also said to her All that you say will be given as evidence against

moment or two and then he said he had—I asked how he became possessed of the metal—he said he had bought it in his shop—I asked him if he had borough it in the bulk or by parts—he said he bought it by pieces and the said he bought it in a lump of a man who worked upon the premises—I no premises were mentioned—I told him he must go with me to the place where the metal was and see Jones—I took him to Mr Pavyer s when Jones was and then Jones said he had received it of Mr Bellamy—then went to Mr Davidson s and took Bellamy into the melting department where there were two men at work—Bellamy said there was one man of the two that he believed was the man he had the metal of—that man turned out to be Dinnage and by putting another dress on him we made him more certain of him—I apprehended Dinnage—Bellamy said his face This is the man —I took him into custody—I have the metal which I got from Mr Pavyer Cross-examined Q Did not Bellamy tell you he thought he should know the man again A He said he thought he should—I said he must go with us and we would show him some persons—when he got to the premises he said I think that is the man by his voice bat he is in another dress and when he put on his right dress he said That is the man but Dinnage seemed to bold his face the reverse way so that Bellamy could not so well identify him—when I told Dinnage he was charged with stealing the property he denied it and said he knew nothing about it—but he said so very faintly JAMES DINNAGE a prisoner I went into Mr Davidson s employ March I remained six or seven weeks with him—there was

husband was not the man—on the Saturday I was sent for again and then Bellamy said he was obliged to say that my husband was the man and if he would say he gave him so much a cwt for it he would give me a sum of money and assist me as much as he could while my husband was in prison and pay the rent—5l was mentioned afterwards Cross-examined Q You left the Compter under the conviction that Bellamy

RUSSELL I am a letter-carrier in the General Post Office the district in which I carry letters includes Palace-yard On the morning of the 8th of October I was on duty at the Post-office—Frost s duty was to collect the paid letters and carry them to the inland letter sorters table where they are sorted—if a paid letter of Messrs Carrey and Wilmer s had been there it ought to have found its way to my seat—I do not recollect having such a letter that day—I did deliver a paid letter at Messrs Currey and Wilmer s that day—the butler generally receives them from me sometimes the servant—I delivered all the letters I found on my seat that morning THOMAS RUSSELL I am assistant inspector of letter carriers I know William Frost—his employment in the morning was to collect letters from the Inland office where they were sorted and convey them to the letter carriers office previous to being carried out—he was employed on that duty on the 8th of October—if a letter was directed to Old Palace-yard it would be his duty to bring it from the Inland office and place it on the seat of the last witness Cross-examined Q Do you know he was on duty that morning from seeing him acting A I know he must have been on duty from the book 1 have here in which his own name is signed against the particular duty he had that morning WILLIAM CURREY I am the son of Mr Currey of the firm of Currey and Wilmer Old Palace-yard On the morning of the 8th of October I was at the house and received the letters delivered by the postman—there was no letter that morning from Mr Barrow—on that morning Mr Currey and Mr Wilmer were both absent from London—Mr Barrow afterwards wrote to us Cross-examined Q You received the letters I suppose from the hands of one of your servants A I do not recollect who it was from—it was not from the postman—it must have been about ten o clock in the morning that I received them—I have no recollection of receiving them that particular morning but I know I was in town—the letters are rather later than usual since the new postage and they vary more—the butler usually receives the letters from the postman MR SHEPHERD Q Was it your duty in the absence of the partners to receive the letters A Yes WILLIAM COOK I am butler to Mr Carrey I generally receive the letters which come by the post—I have no doubt I was at home on the morning of the 8th of October—if I received any letters that morning I delivered them safe—if Mr Currey is in town I lay them in his private room if not I lay them on the slab and the first gentleman who comes in takes them—I recollect Mr William Currey was in town and it would fall to him to take the letters—I placed there all I received Cross-examined Q You do not remember any thing about that particular day A No—there are a great many letters every day—I always deliver the letters to Mr William Currey when he is at home—I never leave them on the slab if Mr Currey is in town—there was one female servant in the house—when she takes them in she leaves them on the slab—it is the general rule to do so—if I am in the house I always take them—it is my duty to go to the door—the letters are sure to come between ten and eleven o clock—the slab is in the front hall ELIZABETH WELLER I am servant to Mr Currey and live at the house of business In the absence of Cook I receive the letters from the postman—I lay them on the slab in the front hall always—I cannot say whether I received any on the 8th of October Cross-examined Q Is it possible you might have received them that day and put them on the slab A I cannot say I do not think it likely no I did not receive them that day I know because when I take them in what there is to pay I always refer to the butler and I had nothing to do with them that day—I am quite sure I did not take them in that day MARY BURFORD I am cook to Mr Attwood of No 8 Delahay-street Westminster The prisoner was footman there—Mrs Attwood had been out of town a month or six weeks and returned on Thursday the 8th of October—the prisoner returned with her—she went out of town again on the Friday and left the prisoner behind—on Saturday morning the 10th of October before twelve o clock I think Frost the postman called on the prisoner—I knew him very well—he had called on the prisoner before—the prisoner was out when he called this time—I cannot recollect whether he came again in the evening—in the evening I saw the prisoner with a 40l Bank note—he took it out of his pocket and said it was a 40l note—I said If it is a 40l note I do not think it is your own it is your mistress s to pay the trades people —I cannot recollect that he made any answer—next morning Sunday he went out about eight or nine o clock and staid out all night—he returned on the Monday—I afterwards saw Frost and I think on the Monday—he called at our house and asked for Gifford but he was not at home—he called afterwards from time to time and I have seen the prisoner with him—they went out—next Sunday the 18th the prisoner went out and returned in the evening—on the Wednesday following he was taken into custody Cross-examined Q How long has Gifford been in Mr Attwood s service A I have heard him say six months—I have been there five months—I think it was unusual for him to have a holiday on Sunday when the family were out of town—he had no employment to keep him constantly in the house when the family were out—he conducted himself in a most proper manner while master and mistress were from home—he had charge of the plate SUSAN HAWKINS I am not related to the prisoner On Saturday morning the 10th of October the prisoner came to my house at half-past eleven o clock Frost came there about ten minutes past twelve and they went away together—Mrs Frost went with them—on the following Monday the prisoner and Frost came together about ten minutes past twelve o clock and went away immediately— I had been out with Mrs Frost and came over Westminster-bridge with her —when the prisoner and Frost came I told them that Mrs Frost had left my house and gone to Prince s-street to Mr Burrell s and on that they quitted my house together Cross-examined Q Do you not know whether Mrs Frost and the prisoner are related A I do not think the female is married to Frost—there is a relationship somehow between the three JOHN CRACKLEN I am a butcher and live in Great Charles-street Westminster On Saturday night the 10th of October or Sunday morning the prisoner came and asked for change for a 40l note—I had not got it and could not give it to him—I think it was on Sunday morning Cross-examined Q Did you know him A Yes ever since he has been in the service—Mr Attwood deals with me ABRAHAM CATCHFIELD I drive the Southgate coach I know the prisoner by frequently carrying him to Southgate as a passenger—on Sunday morning the 11th of October he travelled with me to South-gate—I saw him standing at the Flower-pot in Bishopsgate-street when I drove up—he asked if I could give him change for a 40l note or bill but which of the two I do not recollect—whether I took the from his hand I do not know but I told him I would see if I could get change—I went to the booking-office the book-keeper was not there and I told him I could not get change but would endeavour to get it on the road to Southgate—in going along the road he reminded me about getting change before we got any further and at the next place to Basing-house I applied for change by his desire but being church time I could not get change there—I believe he said nothing further about it—he returned to town with me on Monday morning the 12th at eight o clock—I did not know his name but his person—I considered I could find him at any time being intimate with his friend HENRY EATON I keep the Cherry Tree public-house at Southgate The prisoner came to my house on Sunday the 11th of October I believe —I had seen him before at my house when he came down by the coach and the coachman seemed very friendly with him—I did not know his name—he dined at my house on Sunday came again in the evening had tea and slept there—when he came back in the morning he said he had some silver in his pocket but not quite enough to pay his bill and asked if I would change a 40l note—I said Yes and did so—I paid the note away on Monday morning to Mr Sewell the collector of Taylor and Co the brewers—the prisoner s bill amounted to 7s —I gave him a 10l note perhaps some fives and some sovereigns and silver—I could not swear to the note WILLIAM SEWELL I am collector to Taylor and Co brewers at Lime-house On Monday the 12th of October I received this 40l note from Mr Eaton and gave him change out of it—I have written Eaton on it which I did when I received it—the note produced is the same— examining it THOMAS PHILLIPS I am a clerk in the Bank of England There is not more than one note of the same amount number date and signature GEORGE ARNOLD I live in John-street Blackfriars I lodged with Frost the letter-carrier and paid him 8s a-week for the lodging and for he and his wife looking after my children—they had to the best of my knowledge one table a few odd chairs a bedstead and clock—I do not remember any more furniture—Mrs Frost has sometimes asked me for 1s or so of the 8s before it was due—I lodged with them fifteen or sixteen weeks—I lodged with them in October—they left the house on the Saturday previous to their being taken—I have seen the prisoner twice before at Cumberland-street where I and Frost lived—I saw him on the Sunday morning before they left and once three or four days before MARY TATTERSALL I have known Frost and his wife eighteen months and the prisoner three weeks or a month before he was taken—the first time I saw him was with Mrs Frost in Tothill-street—I have been at Frost s lodging in Cumberland-street and have seen the prisoner there and also seen him at Frost s lodging in John-street—I saw the prisoner and Mr and Mrs Frost in October last and have seen him at Mr Burrcll s public-house in Prince s-street near Westminster Abbey—I saw them there one Monday—I think it was the Monday week before Frost was taken up—I am sure it was on a Monday—I heard of Frost being taken on the Wednesday—I cannot say whether it was the Monday before that—I believe it was the Monday week before—I saw them at Burrell s between twelve and one o clock—they had refreshment there—I saw them on the Sunday following in Cumberland-street—I drank tea there and Frost and the prisoner were there—I did not see the prisoner afterwards—on the Sunday before the Wednesday on which Frost was taken I drank tea at Frost s house in John-street and the prisoner was there then—I saw a new sofa-bedstead and carpet there which I had not seen in Cumberland-street—I was there on the Monday but I did not see the prisoner GEORGE WILLIAMS I am shopman to Mr Crawcour an upholsterer in the New-cut On Saturday the 17th of October Mrs Frost and the prisoner came together to my shop and bought a sofa-bedstead and a round mahogany table which came to 3l 15s —the prisoner paid for them—he tendered me a 5l note—I asked whether he had endorsed it—he said No and if I objected to that one he would give me another—he had some papers in his hands which I concluded were notes—I did not know him before—I sent the goods to No 12 John-street Blackfriars-road for Mr Frost —the prisoner wrote that direction on this piece of paper in pencil BENJAMIN SINGLETON I live in Stafford-place Pimlico I know the prisoner—he came to me on Monday the 19th of October—in the course of conversation I said I wanted to borrow 10l —he put his hand into his pocket and gave me a 10l bank-note—he lent it to me Cross-examined Q What are you A A householder—I am in the service of the King of Hanover—it was his Majesty s pleasure to leave me in England—I have known the prisoner about eight months—I believe him to bear an honest character—I knew where he lived when he lent me the money—I did not ask him whether the note belonged to any body—I gave him a note of hand for it MR SOLICITOR GENERAL Q Is that note of hand now in hit possession A I never had it back NICHOLAS PEARSE I am an inspector of police On Wednesday the 21st of October I saw the prisoner at the door of Mr Attwood s house No 8 Delahay-street—I went up and asked if his name was Gifford and if be resided there—he said Yes —I said Did you change a 40l note at Mr Eaton s at the Cherry Tree public-house at South gate about the 11th or 12th —he said Yes —I said How came you by that note —he said I had it of a female —I asked what female—he said his cousin—I asked where she lived—he said She is gone to Bristol —I said Where does she reside at Bristol —he said I don t know —I told him I was an inspector of police and asked him to accompany me to the station—I was in plain clothes—we walked together to the station—when there I asked when he received the note—he said Last Saturday week —I asked where he received it—he said At

yes—I asked what her husband was—he said he did not know—I said What it his occupation —he said he was a tailor by trade—I said What did she say when she gave you the note —he said she said You can get it changed with some of your trades people I have saved it up unknown to my husband as I want to go into the country to see my friends —I said When did you see her alter that period —he said I saw her on my return from the country in Great George-street she was waiting for me —I understood he meant his return from Southgate that was the only place that had been mentioned—I said What change did

from the Post-office—I told him at the station-house that the note was stolen but not previous to the conversation—I think the conversation was nearly over before I told him the note was stolen—I did not give him any caution about answering me—I took down a few answers which he made while I was asking him the questions—he must have seen me doing it—I put down part of it—the name and address he gave me I put down—I believe I took down part of the conversation while it was going on but it was a very small part—I have not the memorandum here—I think I tore it up—I have not seen it since the examination—I do not know that I took down any answer that he made—I do not recollect taking down more than the address—at that time I did not think the prisoner would appear in this Court—it was a

missed some gloves and woollen cloth or kerseymere WILLIAM BENNETT I was fellow shopman with Wingfield at Potten —I remember Mr Shrosbury going from home on the 17th of December last—about five o

in his hand which I had marked in the morning HENRY FORD I am in the Messrs Warner s employ On the 3rd of August Millwood told me something about some weights—I saw Dedross going from the basket-room that day and placing something in his cap which was on his head—he had no business there—in consequence of some conversation he was brought into the counting-house by Mr Warner—I felt his breast and took a weight out from his inside pocket—it was one of the weights which was taken from the basket-room—Millwood afterwards saw the weight in the constable s possession JAMES DEDROSS a prisoner I am

two pounds at a time—I told them where I came from the first time I went—they asked me where I came from and I told them I came from Messrs Warners —I told the man and woman both—when I sold this

told him I had sold the weight to a boy that sold cherries—Dow asked me where the boy was to be found—I told him by Hoxton new church—I did not say how much the boy was to give mo—I afterwards told him I was going to take it to Petticoat-lane—when I went into the prisoners shop the officers were about twelve yards off—I am sure there were three together—I think there were two City policemen and No 11 from Spitalfields—two went one way and I and one the other and they met one another before I got to the shop—the male prisoner was standing at the shop-door talking to a butcher who was outside the door leaning against the side—I passed by him and went in—the female prisoner was behind the shop—after I sold the weight I went in with Barker and the other officers Q Have you not stated when you went in with Barker and the others I gave it meaning the weight to a girl who was standing behind the counter and she brought it to you meaning the female prisoner and you were standing at that table A No not to my recollection because they were both behind the partition COURT Q You say you first told Dow you had sold this weight to a boy who sold cherries A I told him I intended to sell it to him not that I had sold it because I was not off the premises STEPHEN Dow City police-constable No 166 I saw Dedross on the 3rd of August—he went to a marine-store shop in Petticoat-lane—I was about four yards from him when he went into the shop—I saw him go in—he had a 4lbs weight—I saw it the minute before he entered the shop—I could see into the shop—I saw Mrs Lyons in the shop—I am sure it was her and her husband was standing at the door—I am certain Dedross had no money when he went into the shop for I had searched him at the station in Moor-lane about three o clock—it was about half-past six when he went into the shop but he was never out of my sight during that time—he remained in the shop about two minutes and a half—he gave me 13 1/2 d when he came out—I searched him when he came out and he had not the weight about him—I and Barker then went into the shop and found Mrs Lyons there and her husband standing in front of the door— Dedross was with me—we accused the parties of buying the weight of the lad—the female prisoner denied ever having seen the boy before and said he must be an impudent young rascal for so saying—the male prisoner said we were welcome to search—we did so but could find nothing of the weight—they offered willing search—as we went into the room I saw a girl go into a side passage—I told the male prisoner I was directly opposite and saw the lad go in—I did not know the prisoners before—I told them the boy had no money in his possession when he went into the house and he had 13 1/2 d when he came out and I was certain he had the weight when he went into the shop and then the female prisoner said he was an impudent young rascal far so saying they bad never seen him before in the shop Cross-examined Q Are there not several marine-store shops about there A I am not acquainted with the neighbourhood and did not notice—I went with Dedross and another officer to within a rod of the shop—we were two doors off on the same side of the way—I saw Dedross go in—he did not speak to any one as he went in—I saw a butcher and Lyons standing in front of the door—I was in private clothes—Barker was at the adjoining corner—he had left me about five minutes before Dedross went in—Dedross and I were left alone for a moment or two—we three policemen were not all standing together when Dedross left us to go in—I crossed the road on to the opposite side of the way when Dedross went in—when we went in there was another female there—she was not behind the counter—as I went into the room she went into the side passage—she was just entering into the passage—she was not in the shop but in the adjoining parlour—when I went into the shop I saw a glimpse of her going into the side passage making her way into the shop HENRY CHAS BARKER police-constable H 11 On the 3rd of August I was with Dow—I saw Dedross go into the prisoners house in Petticoat-lane—there are a good many marine-store shops about there but I have not the least doubt it was into the prisoners shop he went—I was next door but two from the shop when he went in about ten yards off—I was not able to see into the shop—I searched the boy before he went in and he had a weight with him—he remained in the shop about five minutes at least that was the time from the time I parted with him till he came back—I searched him when lie came back—he had no weight then and he had 1 1/2 d —he had not that money about him when he went in because he was searched at Spitalfields station in my presence—after he came out I Dow and Perrin went in—the Magistrate did not bind Perrin over—Lyons was standing on the threshold of the door—I said You have just received a weight of this boy —he said I know nothing about any weight and he called to his wife—she was standing in the parlour leading out of the shop—as I went into the shop I saw a female leave the parlour by a door into a passage which leads into a yard and comes again into the shop—when Mrs Lyons came out she said she knew nothing about a weight—Dedross said I have just sold you a weight —she said You must be mistaken for there are other shops in the lane besides ours —he said No I am not I gave the weight to a girl and you were standing at the table she brought it to you at that table and you gave me 1s 1 1/2 d for it —she denied it and repeatedly said she knew nothing about any weight—she denied all knowledge of the boy—we were afforded every facility in searching the house—we could not find any weight—I went out in two or three minutes but could not find where the girl had gone to—she was not in the house Cross-examined Q You had seen the 13 1/2 d found on the boy before you went in A Yes he came out to me with it in his hand—when we went into the shop Dedross said to the female prisoner I gave it to a girl who was standing behind the counter and she brought it to you and you were standing at that table —he did not then say any thing about the 13 1/2 d —he did afterwards—I cannot say exactly when—there was a constant repetition—I told the Magistrate that he had said she gave him 13 1/2 d Stephen Bailey hair-dresser Middlesex-street Aldgate Moses Benjamin

JOHN GOODMAN I am in the employ of Messrs Kennaby wholesale perfumers of Westmoreland buildings Aldersgate-street On the 24th of July I received an order from Mrs Scott of Barnsley for a number of articles of perfumery—I packed them in a box on the 20th—I have a copy of the invoice which went with the goods—there were two dozen of Finnegan s cream at 3s 6d two dozen ditto at 2s 6d three dozen of Atkinson s bear s grease at 2s 6d one dozen of balm of Columbia and other articles—among the things now produced are two out of half a dozen of almond shaving cakes ten out of a dozen balm of Columbia one dozen and eleven out of two dozen half-size of Finnegan s cream the whole of the 3s 6d size three out of one dozen of don to tooth-powder and also some soap—the gross amount of the articles invoiced is 14l 4s 3d —the invoiced price of the articles found is about 9l 4s 2d —here are all the dummy pots which were among the things sent—a number of articles have been produced to me by Hay ward the officer which in every respect correspond with the articles I had put into the parcel—I know some of them by the mark on the outside wrapper—this 2s 6d is pat on by Mr James Kennaby to distinguish the size—that is in precisely the same state as when we sent it out—here is one of the 3s 6d since which is packed precisely as it was when I sent it—after packing the articles I put on the address on the box Mrs Scott Barnsley Yorkshire —I then handed the box over to the porter and directed him to take it to Mr Pickford s JAMES LEWIS KENNABY This parcel has my handwriting on it—I remember receiving the order for these goods and calling it over with Mr Goodman—I remember the packing up of the goods—I know the articles were contained in that package—Finnegan a cream it an article not very easy to be had—there are but few agents in London for the tale of it—I know this particular article came from our shop—we have had but nine dozen of that size since we commenced dealing with Mr Finnegan and I know bow they have all been disposed of with the exception of this portion—all those I have sold went into the country and none in London at all ALEXANDER HOWARD On the 20th of July I took a package directed to Mrs Scott of Barnsley to Messrs Pickford s at the Castle in Wood-street Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Why do you call it Messrs Pickford s A It is called so—I delivered the goods at the Castle inn to the person who signed my book—that is all I know JOHN AYRES I am a checker off and porter at Messrs Pickford s at the Castle inn in Wood-street I received a box in the evening part of the 20th of July and checked it on the delivery book—it was my business to take the box and place it among the other goods to go to Barnsley in Yorkshire by railway—it would leave our place by wagon which was to go to the Birmingham railway where we have a warehouse WILLIAM HANDS I am clerk at the Castle inn in Wood-street—it is the concern of Thomas Pickford and Joseph Baxendale I remember teeing a package there on the 20th of July directed to Mrs Scott of Barnsley—I attended the loading of the wagon—it was loaded to go to the warehouse at the railway station at Caraden-town—this package was placed on the wagon soon after it was weighed—I saw it weighed and checked it off in my book Cross-examined Q Does Mr Thomas Pickford interfere in the business at all A Yea—I believe he acts there—I know he is in the concern—I heard it from them that know—I have not seen him for some time—I cannot say how long—I cannot tell whether I have seen him within this twelve or eighteen months—I might have seen him within the three years—he is at Manchester—I do not know him no further than by sight—I saw him once when he was in London—I should know him again if I saw him—he is not tall—he is rather stout—it was about fourteen months or two years ago that I saw him—he was then in the yard MR PRENDERGAST Q You have always been the clerk of Thomas Pickford and Joseph Baxendale A Yes—they pay me my wages GEORGE BASS I am in the employ of Pickford and Co and am guard to the wagons that go from Wood-street to Camden-town On the 20th of July—I took the wagon away from the Castle inn to Camden-town and saw it unloaded at the warehouse—I do not know whether the parcel in question was on the wagon or not—whatever was in the wagon I took to Camden-town—it was not my business to make the way bill—it was Eyre s business to load the wagon Cross-examined Q When did you see Mr Pickford A I never saw him in my life THOMAS PARSONS It is my place to check the goods that arrive it Pickford s warehouse at Camden-town station by the wagon from Wood-street—I am in the employ of Messrs Pickford and Baxendale Cross-examined Q Did you ever see Mr Pickford A Yes about eighteen months ago but not at all since—lam not aware that he has been in London since—I saw him then in Camden-town in a gig with Mr Bax-endale—I had never seen him before—I was told it was Mr Pickford by his servants who have known him for many years—he was a tallish man—he was not old or young—I cannot exactly tell the size of a man sitting in a gig—I have known the firm for these twenty years and always knew it to go by the name of Pickford and Co MARY ANN SCOTT I live at Barnsley I gave an order for a quantity of perfumery to Messrs Kennaby—I never received the goods according to that order WILLIAM HOLLAND I am a policeman I took the prisoner into custody on Saturday the 24th of July—when the prisoner was in custody I and Hay ward went to his house—we had left Fisher an officer in the house when we first took the prisoner and when we returned I saw Hay-ward find in the parlour on the left hand side of the door seventy-three packages consisting of those now produced—I also saw Hayward bring down twenty-eight more from up stairs but did not see him find them JAMES HAYWARD I am a policeman I went back after the prisoner was in custody and found Fisher in possession there—I searched the bouse in company with Holland—in the attic at the top of the house I found twenty-eight pots of pomatum laid in a large empty box with some straw at the bottom—the box had no lid to it—I then went down into the parlour at the back of the shop and on the left-hand side of the door I found seventy-three more packages of perfumery covered with a handkerchief—I took all the articles to the station and have now produced them—they—have been seen by Mr Goodman and Mr Kennaby THOMAS FISHER I am a policeman I was left in charge of the premises from the time the prisoner was taken into custody by Holland till they were afterwards searched in my presence by Holland and Hayward when the prisoner was in custody—I know where these things were found in the parlour—nothing was done with those articles after the prisoner was taken into custody—no one had access to that part of the premises while I was there—they must have been in the same position as when he left—I saw a parcel in the corner with a handkerchief covered over them when I first went in and it afterwards turned out to be the seventy-three articles of perfumery Cross-examined Q He had been taken away in custody A Yes and I remained behind till the officers returned—I was only there about an hour HENRY WILLIAM DUBOIS I am a policeman I found this book lying on the window-ledge in the parlour at the back of the shop—among numerous other entries there is an entry of Job of scents 5l Cross-examined Q A great many of the other entries are in pencil A A good many—there is no other entry in ink but that in that page only the entry in the cash balance—here is another entry in ink on another folio Three dozen sticks and that is the only other one in ink all the others are in pencil—I took two other books away—the prisoner was in custody at the time—ink marks are much more difficult to rub out than pencil MR PRENDERGAST Q There is a mode of tearing them all off together A Certainly or scratching out with a knife but I see no erasure here nor any marks rubbed out—the prisoner was apprehended on the 24th—I found this book on the 26th DANIEL BAILEY I am in the employ of Messrs Thomas Pickford and Joseph Baxendale They are the carriers from the Castle inn in Wood-street to the station at Camden-town Cross-examined Q When did you see Mr Pickford A About six months ago—I saw him on our premises then—I have been in the employ ever since—I will not swear I have seen him since COURT Q You have no reason to suppose he has turned over his business to any one else A Not the slightest

t18411025-2602  2602 WILLIAM CLARK and GEORGE COUCH were indicted for feloniously receiving on the 25th of September 45lbs weight of nails value 1l 10s 9d the goods of Benjamin Robinson well knowing the same to have been stolen against the Statute &c MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution JAMES BARBER A prisoner I am sixteen years old and have been in gaol since the Magistrate committed me—I was in the service of Mr Benjamin Robinson in Little Britain—I was working in the farriery—I know Clark—my master had some nails for securing the shoes of horses at his farriery On the 23rd of September I took 43lbs weight of my master s nails to Clark—I know there was 43lbs because I weighed them—the nails were kept in a loft at my master s—there was one sort of nails and three sizes of the sort—I took them wrapped up in some tow from one to two o clock in the day—I had been to Clark once before with an old man—when I got there on the 23rd of September I saw Couch who is a man who Clark keeps—I told him I had brought some nails—he said I was to wait till Clark came in—Clark was out—I waited an hour and a half—when he came he told Couch to go and weigh them—when Couch came back he told Clark there were 43lbs and Mrs Clark said I must take 4lbs off for the wrappers—Clark gave me 10s —Couch took the nails across into the house where Clark lived and emptied them out—Clark reckoned the value of the nails at 16s 10d —he gave me 10s and said he would give me the rest when I came again—I went again on the Monday —he told me to come again on the Saturday—I had left nails at the same place before—when I went with the old man I did not go in to the shop—I had not settled with Clark for any nails when the old man was with me—the old man used to give me what he liked—the foreman of my master s establishment missed some nails and asked me about them—I gave an account to him of what I had done with the nails—I do not recollect what day it was—it was the day Clark was taken—in consequence of what I told Mr Boreham I was employed on the 29th to take 20lbs of nails to Clark s house and the officer followed me Cross-examined by MR FRAZER Q Do you know the difference between being committed for trial and being in prison the first time A No I was only walking in the street with the policeman one day—I have been advised to speak the truth—I told the truth—I was not advised that I know of—I spoke the truth that is all—no one told me—I have not always said that some one else gave me 10s and not Clark—Clark gave it me—I have said so before—I did not have any conversation with the policeman—I was out with him one day till twelve o clock—he asked me where the old man lived and his name and he could not find him any where—I went out with him at five in the morning and staid till twelve—nothing took place about Clark not a word nor about Couch—I do not know who the old man was—he used to go about buying parings—he came into the yard and asked if I had got any nails to sell—I never said that some money was to be given to the old man—Mr Clark said he supposed he was my grandfather MR CLARKSON Q Where did you go with the old man to receive the money A I stopped outside Clark s house while the old man went in to get the money—the two prisoners were in custody when the Magistrate gave me directions to go with the policeman to try to find the old man CYRUS BOREHAM I am principal clerk to Mr Benjamin Robinson On the 1st of September I received three bags of nails called sixes sevens and eights—they weighed 5cwt 1qr 17lbs —they were put in a loft over the farrier s shop—in consequence of information I examined and weighed them on the 29th of September—there were 2cwt 2qrs deficient besides what we had used which I suppose was about 1cwt —in consequence of suspicion I questioned Barber and he made a disclosure to me on the subject of these nails—in consequence of what he said I weighed 20lbs of the nails we had left and marked about fifty of them—we gave the nails to Barber to take as he used to do—I and a policeman whom I had sent for went in plain clothes and followed Barber—he went to Clark s shop between three and four in the afternoon—he waited about an hour and a half—I saw Clark go in a few minutes previous to Couch coming out to weigh the nails—he took them to a chandler s shop directly opposite where we were waiting—in five or ten minutes after Couch returned to Clark s shop Barker came out—he gave the officer 4s —we then went into the shop—the officer pointed to the nails and said I have come about these nails —Clark said to the man in the farrier s shop You make haste and shoe my horse —the officer then told Clark he must go along with us—when he got outside and saw we were determined to take him he endeavoured to make his escape and said he knew nothing about the nails—on the following morning I examined the back wall at Clark s shop— the wail was very much scratched on Clark s side—they were such scratches as would be made by a parcel of nails being got up and thrown over the wall they appeared quite fresh and by the side of the wall on Clark s side I found one nail and three nails on the other side—they were the same sort as belonged to my master—since then 2cwt all but 12lbs of nails have been produced by Mrs Twigg which are of the same description and size as my master s—I believe them to be his property and they and the others which have been found make up nearly the amount we lost Cross-examined Q When you found these marks on the wall were the prisoners in custody A Yes—when Clark was taken I should say he was not sober—he was not so much in liquor but that he knew what he was about—he did not say that the premises were not his—I should not have taken him to be Clark EDWARD HUTCHINGS City police-constable No 207 I went to Clark s house—I saw Couch come out with a bag and a paper—he went to a green-grocer s shop and then went back—Barber came out and gave me 4s and said that was what he sold the nails for—I then went in and saw the nails on the side of the board—I saw Couch there—I said to him Are you master of the shop —he gave no answer—Clark then came to the side of the horse—I said I come about these nails you bought —he said to Couch Do my horse —I said I am an officer I came about these nails —he said I know nothing about the nails what nails I buy I buy at my ironmongers —when I brought him out he tried to escape—I saw the marks on the sides of the wall—it appeared to me that the nails had been put up on one side of the wall and put down on the other side—I saw a bag of nails produced which appeared to me the same as those at the prosecutor s—they had small bits of tow mixed with them Cross-examined Q Did you not go with Mr Boreham Yes—I did not see Clark go into his shop—the first time I saw him was when I went into the shop—he was then standing by the side of the horse JAMES WILD I am a coal-dealer and keep a chandler s-shop very near Clark s farriery On the 23rd of September Couch came to me to weigh some nails—I weighed them—there were upwards of 40lbs of them Cross-examined Q Did you not see some one come there with a boy A There was an old man came one day—Clark used to send things to be weighed at my place SUSANNAH TWIGG I am single and live in Britannia-street—my back yard is divided from Mr Clark s premises by a wall—I did not know who the premises belonged to but the officer got on the wall and said so On the 29th of September I was in my back kitchen about eight o clock at night and all at once I heard something fall off the wall—I went out and saw the shadow of two men at a distance—I then went to my work again and when my nephew came home he found a large bag of nails—I let the police have them BENJAMIN PHILLIPS I am a policeman —I received the bag of nails from Twigg William Hughes a master carman George Little omnibus proprietor —Burrows a master baker —Stanbury a carman and—Taunton a farrier gave Clark a

goods of George Langster and another —4th COUNT stating them to be the goods of William White and others —Several other COUNT stating them to be the goods of various other persons MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution EDWARD IRELAND I am foreman at Miller s-wharf Thames-street On the 9th of October this order was brought to Miller s-wharf by a person but it was neither of the prisoners—I had seen the man who brought it before and knew his person but not his name—in consequence of the delivery of this order I gave the man who brought it the goods mentioned in it—it was three bales—the marks and numbers were mentioned in the order—he had a cart—I helped to put the bales into the cart and he drove away Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Do you know the name of the man A No—he had been at the wharf four or five times before—there were two men there who are in my master s employ—the man was about my height and had sandy whiskers MR BODKIN Q Look at the prisoners and state whether you will swear it was neither of these men A It was neither of these men THOMAS HOSIE I am one of the persons to whom Miller s-wharf belongs—I have more than one partner JOHN SAYWARD JUN I live in Hereford-place Commercial-road and keep a linendraper s shop—I know the prisoner Levine—he called on me on Monday morning the 11th of October I think between ten and eleven o clock or between ten and twelve he brought some small patterns of calico about quarters of yards—he asked me 5d a yard for them—I offered him 3 1/2 d —I ultimately agreed with him for twenty pieces at 4d a yard—they had stamps on them one stamp blue and two red I believe—I saw him again that afternoon—he came I think about five or six o clock—he wanted to know if the calicoes had come—I told him they had not and that I should like some more with the blue stamps on them—he said he did not know whether he should see the parties that night or not—on the following morning thirty pieces of calicoes came—I was below stairs and I was called up I found the goods there and the two prisoners—I had never seen Beamond before but I had seen Levine—I said I must look at the calicoes to see that the lengths were right and told them to come again in the evening—they went away and came again in an hour and a half after about twelve o clock in the day—I had then examined some of the lengths and was satisfied that they were right—I paid them at the rate of 4d a yard for the thirty pieces—I have the bill of parcels here—it was brought to me ready written and the receipt was written to it in my shop by Levine—I then paid him 29l 11s —Beamond was present—I think I saw Levine again that afternoon or evening—he was there alone—I asked him if he should have any more calico—he said he did not know—he brought me four pieces more the next day—he came alone and I paid him—this is the bill—it was written in my shop I believe but I will not be positive—I sometimes use blue ink and this is written in blue ink on the head of one of my bills—I did not see it written but the probability is it was written there—I paid him for them at 4d a yard the same as the first bargain—I afterwards sent twenty-eight of these pieces to Luck and Co of Bread-street and gave the other six pieces to Miller the constable—I also gave him another piece which I received from my father The bills being ready were headed Bought of E Beamond and the receipt signed S Levine Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How long have you known Levine A About three years—I frequently bought of him before—I should not have bought of him if I had seen any thing suspicious in his dealings—I gave what I considered a fair price—I have been in the trade twenty years I dare say—I charged Luck and Co 4 1/4 d a yard for these calicoes—we consider Luck and Co s a very respectable house indeed—I have known them about twelve months—I think they live in Bread-street Cheapside—it is a very customary thing indeed in trade for persons to sell what are called cheap lots and some of the most eminent houses in the City buy them the largest houses in the trade persons who are turning hundreds and thousands MR FRANCIS HOBLER I have acted for a great number of years as clerk to the Justice-room at the Mansion-house I remember on the 16th of October Mr Alderman Pirie sitting for the then Lord Mayor—the two prisoners were under examination—after certain statements had been made and several hearings the Magistrate remitted the case to the County—I have a note of what was stated by the witnesses and the prisoners on that occasion Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Are these the original notes A Yes—I will not undertake to say I took every thing down they said—I cannot say that—I should think Beamond was not three minutes in making his statement or not two minutes perhaps—I did not take it all down—here is the essence of what was said—here are a great many contractions in it I—I do not recollect whether Beamond was cautioned before he spoke that what he said would be given in evidence—that has sometimes been done at the Mansion-house but there is no fixed rule of any kind MR CLARKSON Q Do you or do you not interfere with the prisoner to prevent his making any voluntary statement A Very seldom— reads — Edward Beamond and Solomon Levine being sworn Levine says On Sunday while I was out Beamond came and wanted to see me at St Thomas-the-Apostle—he asked if I could do any thing in calicoes—I went to Whitecross-street with him—Mr Sayward offered 4d —I have known Beamond eleven months—Mr Manning only offered 3d —I received the money of Sayward and gave the money to Beamond Beamond says Two men came to me on Sunday to know if I would buy goods—I said I had no money—they said they would bring samples—one was a short man in black MR PHILLIPS Q Will you be good enough to attend to what I read— reads — On Sunday whilst I was out Beamond came and wanted to see me at St Thomas-the-Apostle—he asked if I would do any thing in calicoes—I went to Whitecross-street with him Do you mean by that note that Levine represented that he went out on the Sunday with him or the Monday Witness Immediately I suppose—I will not undertake to swear that he did not say it was on the Monday he went to Whitecross-street SADLER SPEAKMAN I am a linendraper and live at Shadwell I remember the 14th of October very well—in the early part of that week Levine called on me and said he had got some calicoes to dispose of—he said he had sold some to Mr Hallett and he would call on me the next morning in his way down—on the 14th he came with Beamond and brought two pieces of calico with him—he asked 4d a yard for them—I said I should not buy them I did not want them—I said if I took twelve pieces they would take something less—Beamond then said 3 3/4 d —I said if they would take an eighth off I would—I bought twelve pieces of one quality at 3 1/2 d and an eighth that is 3 5/8 d and they brought them down in the afternoon—I remember seeing the pieces on the counter and the two prisoners were there—the lengths were taken and I paid the money down to Levine—I wanted 2 1/2 per cent off for cash and he gave me half-a-crown—I required an invoice—he came down the following day and made the invoice out in my shop on the back of one of my bills—this is it—he has given me discharge by cash 10l 11s —this was on Friday the 15th—he was without Beamond then—the inspector called on me and nine whole pieces and three short lengths were given up to the police but not in my presence—a part of them had been sold—I know them Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTONE Q How long have you known Levine A I think four or five months—I have known him as dealing in articles of this description—he gave me his own address but not Bermond s—I did not ask him any thing about Beamond—I should think I gave a fair price for them—I sold them at 3 3/4 d a yard—Levine told me he was the agent MR CLARKSON Q What have you known about Levine A Nothing more than as a commission agent—he called on me with goods and referred me to parties in the neighbourhood to Mr Cadman an iron monger next door and several others whose names I did not notice EDMUND MANNING I live in Aldgate High-street and am a linen-draper On the 13th of October I purchased twenty-four pieces of calico of the prisoner Levine—I first saw him about them on Tuesday the 12th I believe—he told me he had some calico to sell and he brought two piece the same day—he asked 4 1/2 d —a yard for them—I declined to give that price for them—he asked me what I would give—I told him I did not want them and would rather not have them—at least I said I would not give more than 3 1/2 d —he turned round to Beamond who was with him and they talked a little and Beamond said Well I shall get a farthing a yard —then Levine said Very well you shall have them —he asked me how many I would have whether I would have ninety pieces—I said no I would have twenty pieces—I ultimately agreed to buy twenty pieces—they then went away—twenty-four pieces of calico came the next day the 13th—I did not see who brought them—I saw a bale lying in the shop—I afterwards saw the prisoners on the same day—I said there were more than I ordered—one of the prisoners said Well I suppose you will take them —I said very well as they were brought to me I would—I told Levine if he would make out an invoice and leave it I would see if they were right—he then wrote out this invoice and left it—Levine called in the afternoon—I paid him—Levine wrote this receipt— read — Received 20l 11s as per account S L Levine —I did not see Beamond when I paid the money—nothing was said about the ownership of the goods—seventeen of the pieces were ultimately given to the policeman—the rest went into my stock and have been sold Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How long had you known Levine A About fifteen years—in the course of that time I have had many transactions with him as a commission-agent I never knew any thing likely to excite suspicion—I should not have dealt with him if I had—it is very common to sell in that way—some of the highest houses in London deal in that way in cheap lots—I gave what I considered a fair price—I sold seven pieces at 4 1/4 d and some at 4 1/2 d —I should not have thought of giving 5d for them—the goods were left with me some time as I wished to be certain all was right—I did not know where Levine lived—I asked him to put his address on the invoices and he put No 116 Lucas-street Commercial-road readily on my requesting him JOHN SAYWARD re-examined I buy my Scotch goods where I can get them cheapest—I have some similar to what they brought but not with the same stamp on them Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q What do you mean by similar A Goods got up in a similar way to these of the same width—we buy them in 30inch 32inch and 34inch JOHN SAYWARD I am the last witness s father and live in New Road St George s In October I purchased two pieces of calico of Levine—I had this bill and receipt—I gave 4d a yard—I said Make out a bill and receipt I will pay you which he did—both the prisoners were together— bill read — October 12 1841 Mr Sayward to S L Levine 116 Lucas-street Commercial-road 2 pieces of calico 120 yards and a half at 4d 2l 0s 2d Received S L LEVINE —I delivered one of them to Miller and the other my son had Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How long have you been in business A Thirty years—I gave a fair price for these goods—I have known Levine some years by being about the neighbourhood and buying of him—he is a commission-agent—I saw nothing unfair in the transaction in any way—I got no profit on the piece I sold to my son MR CLARKSON Q When did your son have it A The next day—I did not want these goods particularly—they brought them in for a sample—I have bought goods with this mark on it but it is two or three years ago—I bought them of a wholesale house — WILLIS examined by MR PHILLIPS I saw the person who came to take away the calico from Miller s Wharf the man that came in a cart—only one man came after them—he was rather a tallish man about five feet eight or nine inches—he was an elderly man I should think about thirty-five—he was dressed in a dark frockcoat I think a black coat—he came in the morning before with another man whom I knew—his name was Richard Styles—Caywood was with me—I and he have not been talking about it on the road—I was not told to describe the man who came for the calico MR CLARKSON Q Was he either of the two prisoners A No GEORGE CAYWOOD examined by MR PHILLIPS I saw the man who came for the calico—I think he had a black coat on—I am quite sure it was neither of the prisoners HARRIET SLEGG I am unmarried and live at No 116 Lucas-street Commercial-road I know Levine—he came to lodge at my house on the 9th of August—I have seen Beamond at my house—he came to see Levine—I might have seen him at the latter end of August or the beginning of September—Beamond came to my house on the 13th of October—Levine was not at home—Beamond asked for him—he brought two parcels of calico in a cart—one had the appearance of a bale the other was in a bag—I told him Levine was not at home—he asked if he might leave the goods and I gave him permission—he left two packages a sort of bale and a bag—the bale was in paper—they were placed in my wash-house—I saw Levine about an hour afterwards when he came to the door and Beamond with him—Levine asked if there was any thing left for him—I said This gentleman has left two packages —they went into the wash-house and looked at the two parcels—I believe they took two pieces out of one of them at that time and went out—the whole of the goods were taken away the next day the Thursday in a cab there were four pieces left behind which I think must have come out of the bag—I do not think the bale was opened at all—they took them away together—I am a dress-maker—there is no shop at my house—Levine asked me if I would like to purchase a piece—the four pieces were left in the wash-house before purchased one—I removed them from the wash-house on account of the dampness and put them in Levine s bed-room—I purchased one piece between myself and two friends—I gave 4 1/2 d a yard for it—they came back together about five o clock—they then took the three remaining pieces away—the bag was in the back parlour at the time they took that away with them Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q What business has Levine been carrying on A I considered him a commission-agent and he sold goods for various persons—I know several he sold goods to MR CLARKSON Q When did Beamond first come to your place A About the latter end of August—I should think Levine had then been there a fortnight—Beamond brought a large quantity of lard with him —it was left at my house and remained there four or five days—it came in a bag—it was taken away in smaller parcels—I saw no one take it but the two prisoners WILLIAM LAST I am traveller to Luck and Co of Bread-street and live in Spencer-street Goswell-road They sell Gordon and Barren s Scotch goods—our cloth is stamped in red but it is a particular stamp of our own—all our goods are delivered through Messrs Sangster—I remember six or weeks ago calling on Mr Sayward junior—I saw there some pieces of calico like these that are here—they attracted my attention—I knew then as Gordon and Barron s factory—I went back to my employers and told them I had seen them—I wrote a note to Sayward and purchased the whole of them twenty eight pieces at 4 1/4 d a yard—we sell them at 5d and 5 1/2 d and have a commission out of that—my attention was attracted by the lowness of the price in comparison with what we pay—a communication was made to the house of Oliver Dear and Co and to Sangster s—we have never sold so many as twenty-two pieces to any one person in town—one or two pieces of a width is the general quantity—they are sold at a list price Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q This is not the crest on your goods A No—ours is a lion—we are in the habit of sending these goods into the country—we have not had them above two months in the house—during that time 150 to 200 pieces have passed through our house MR CLARKSON Q But you never sold any with the dove on them or the stag like these A No HUGH RUSSELL I am clerk in the house of George Sangster and Co in Queen-street Cheapside—they are agents to G Forbes and Co —there are two partners—I received on the 15th of September invoices for Oliver Dear and Co Luck and others by post that these things were to come—the bale marked O D and Co was consigned to Sangster and Co to be applied to the exclusive sale of Oliver Dear and Co —those for Luck and the other to whom they were directed—I have examined the whole of the pieces found—sixty-five pieces—they are marked on the invoice G G and P O D and Co and bear the stamp peculiar to these marks—the goods are of the same description as those in the invoice in every respect—the bale marked O D and Co is No 349 containing forty pieces thirty-two inches hard finished—it corresponds in all particulars with those which have been found—those marked W and G correspond with those which have been found—they are hard finished— G G and P are called soft finished and so are the goods—the width and the seal correspond exactly and the general number that they pack is thirty in one bale but O D and Co are packed forty and of that mark here are thirtythree pieces found which are three more than are usually supplied to any house but Oliver Dear and Co —the signature John Russell for George Sangster and Co on this order is not my handwriting—it is altogether a forgery—the marks in this order and the numbers correspond with the marks in the invoices which were duly remitted to us so that the person who forged the order must have had access to that invoice—inquiries were instituted by my principals into this matter in consequence of information from Luck and Co and on my going to the wharf I found this order—the printing is like our orders but they have put the number of the premises 85 and our house is No 5— read — London October 9 1841 Mr Hosie Miller s Wharf please to deliver R Steynes the undermentioned goods 21—40—84 3 bales for G Sangster and Co H RUSSELL Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q What number of these kind of goods are annually remitted from Scotland to your house A I cannot say—the dealings are very large—to the amount of some thousand pieces and they are all marked as these are—they are sold to all the houses whose particular marks they bear and sold at what they call a list price—they go into the country parts of England—I should say under the circumstances that these goods have not travelled about—I will not say that some of them have not been in the country MR CLARKSON Q How do you know these A I have been round to the witnesses and found the goods to agree exactly with those missing and I found from the persons I have been to that they could give me accounts of all they had been dealing with JAMES BROWN I live at Aberdeen and am in the employ of Alexander Forbes and others—they trade under the name of Gordon Barron and others On the 27th of February 1841 I packed three bales for Miller s-wharf consigned to Sangster and Co —I have got my book in which I entered the goods as I packed them—one bale is entered in my own handwriting—they are marked with O D and Co which I put on a bale forwarded for Oliver Dear and Co —it was stamped with a dove in red—this piece corresponds with the quality and finish and the width and the dove—about thirty pieces were marked with my own mark Q Now look on the next occasion on which there was a package made up marked G G P A Yes—here it is—it is not in my own handwriting—I looked in the book and checked the packages as they were packed—about the 14th of September there were thirty pieces packed marked with a stag in red the Aberdeen Arms and Gordon Barron and Co —this piece— looking at one —corresponds in all respects—this is soft-finished—the goods which were packed that day were soft-finished—about four of these are marked with my own handwriting—Mr Forbes s name is Alexander and there are several other partners Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How many thousands of these are consigned from your house to London in the course of a year About nine or ten thousand on many of which I write figures—a great many of them with these stags on them and the Aberdeen Arms—there are thousands of pieces of soft-finish and of this width made up—I will not swear—I these came in the bales—they are similar—one piece is like another piece suppose twenty thousand have been marked with my figures in the last three years HUGH MCKENZIE I am a bleacher in the employ of Gordon Barron and Co —I have a book in which I enter the bleaching of their calico— this piece O D and Co with a stag on it was bleached on the 18th of April 1840—this piece No 195 on the 1st of February 1840—the whole of these marked O D and Co were bleached from September 14 1839 to April 18—these marked G G and P were all bleached between the 1st of May 1841 and the 22nd of the same month—on the 15th of September 1841 I assisted in packing a bale for Miller s-Wharf containing thirty pieces of thirty-two inch width and soft-finish marked G G and P —these pieces which are here correspond in all particulars with the pieces I so packed—on the 1st of February 1841 I assisted in packing a bale marked W G and Co —it contained thirty pieces of thirty inches wide and hard-finish what we call beetlings—some of the pieces here produced correspond in all particulars with them—no goods are sent to London with a dove on them except to Oliver Dear and Co nor any with a stag on them except to Grant Grant and Phillips Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How many thousands of pieces are sent in the course of twelve months to these different houses A About ten thousand—these pieces which are here correspond in all respects with hundreds and thousands which are sent to London—I will not venture to say when these pieces came into this country WILLIAM NICOL police-constable K 177 I was called to the house of Mr Speakman on the 15th of October—I found Levine there—he was given into custody—I told him he was charged on suspicion of stealing these goods or being concerned with others in stealing them—he said I did not steal them I was employed to sell them on commission —I said For whom —he said For a man name Beamond in Little St Thomas Apostle —he told me he did not exactly know the name of the man—after taking him to the station in consequence of something he said to me I went to a public-house in Whitecross-street and took him with me—that was where he said the man would be found—we waited nearly an hour and could find no man—I then went to Little St Thomas Apostle and found Beamond there in the top back room in bed—there was only one bed and two or three chairs in the room—it was a very small room—Levine went in with me—he said to Beamond They have taken me about the calico —Beamond said You did not sell it for me —Levine said But I sold it with you —Beamond then got up and I took him away—Levine told me previously that he had sold some to Mr Manning—I went there and received seventeen pieces of calico—Levine said he would tell all when he got before the Magistrate Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Levine was giving you an account of the pieces he had sold A Yes—he said he had sold twenty or twenty-four pieces to Mr Manning—he told me voluntarily about Mr Manning MR BODKIN Q Did you give the pieces of goods you received to Miller A I did ELIAS MILLER City police-constable No 408 I have produced sixty-five pieces of calico—I received twenty-eight of them at the house of Luck and Co seven from Sayward the younger one from the father twelve from Speakman and seventeen from Manning GEORGE GILBERT I am in the employ of Oliver Dear and Co Mr Dear s name is James—Mr Oliver is deceased—there are others—they are consignees of all the calico that comes from the house of Gordon Barron and Co marked with the dove—it is not a common occurrence to sell as many as thirty pieces to one purchaser Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Do you speak from your own recollection or from books A From both—I have referred to the books to be perfectly certain—I could trust to my memory but this was so singular a circumstance that I referred to the books MR BODKIN Q For the last four years have you sold forty pieces to one person A Yes on the 12th of December 1840 to Mr Amos of Bristol—that is the only instance in which forty pieces have been sold to one customer these four years MR PHILLIPS Q How many pieces do you dispose of in the course of a year with the dove on A I do not know—I will not swear that we have not distributed twenty thousand through England in the last three years—we are the only persons who receive those with the dove on them and we distribute them—there are but few sold in London—I should think not thirty pieces in a year JOHN BRAND City police-constable No 316 I produce a certificate of the prisoner Beamond s former conviction which I got from Mr Clark s office— read —he is the man who was then tried and convicted Benjamin

against the Statute &c MR PHILLIPS conducted the Prosecution SUSAN WATSON I am the wife of Harris Watson a stove manufacturer and live at No 36 White Cross-place in the parish of St Leonard Shoreditch About the middle of November the prisoner Ann Gifford see page 390 came to me for a situation—we agreed on the wages—she gave me a reference to a lady at No 45 Northampton-square Clerkenwell—it was at eleven o clock precisely when she left my house and I appointed to see her again at the lady s house where I was going for her reference—she was to was there till I went and received her answer on my ascertaining the truth of the reference—I went but found no such place in Northampton-square as she referred me to—there are but thirty-six houses in the square—I found no such person as the lady she referred me to—I returned home about half-past four and missed my husband s silver watch from the drawing-room mantel-piece and nice spoons out of the plate-basket in the kitchen—they were safe when I left the house—I had given the spoons to the servant to clean and they were placed on the kitchen dresser—I saw the watch safe on the drawing-room mantelpiece CATHERINE SAYER In November last I lived in Mrs Watson s service I saw the prisoner Ann Gifford when she came to my mistress in the morning about the situation—she came again a little after three o clock when my mistress had gone out—I went to the door and said my mistress was not at home—she said she had seen my mistress in the court and she had told her she was to come and wait till she came back and that she was to go into the same room as she was in in the morning—believing what she said I showed her into the drawing-room which was the room she had been in before—in about a quarter of an hour she came down into the kitchen to me and said she could not wait any longer for she should be too late for the train and if she was too late for the train she would call again in the evening—I did not miss the spoons till after my mistress missed the watch—I had seen them safe when I was in the kitchen JOHN HARDMAN PICKFORD I am in partnership with Mr Roberts a pawnbroker in Old-street-road I produce a silver watch which was pledged by the male prisoner for 1l 15s on the 6th of December in the name of John Gifford No 18 Old-street—he said it was his own watch and that he had often had 3l on it—he mentioned the name of Smith a pawnbroker living close by who had let him have 3l on it—he came again on the 10th of December and had 1l 5s more on it making up the 3l Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q About what is the worth of it A I should say 4l or 5l in the trade—I do not think it would sell for more than that to a watch-maker but if you wanted one made like it it would be 10l —I am quite certain he said he had often had 3l on it—I had seen him before—I firmly believe he used the word often —I never had any doubt about it WILLIAM BARTON I am an inspector of the G division I apprehended the male prisoner on the 10th of December in Aske-street Hoxton—I searched him at the station and found in his trowsers-pocket a sovereign a shilling a sixpence three halfpence and a farthing—I was proceeding to search his fob when he said You will find nothing there but the ticket of a watch which was my father s some tickets of some tools and a watch-guard —I found the ticket of the watch which led me to Mr Pickford s where I found it—the male prisoner lives at No 41 Aske-street—I have seen him in company with the female prisoner at their lodgings—he said she was his wife Cross-examined Q Did he say he had not been long married to her A He said they were married in December—Ann Gifford was first apprehended by another constable and was handed over to me—she was in my custody when the male prisoner came up and asked what I was doing with her—I asked him where he lived and he told me—he went to the door of No 41 Aske-street and knocked—he did so with perfect readiness—when he asked me what I was doing with his wife I said I was a police-inspector and she was in my custody for felony—I did not take him then I took him three hours after at his own house in consequence of some other property being found—he made no objection to my searching him—he behaved with perfect readiness throughout the whole transaction—there was only the ticket of one watch in his fob—I am quite certain he said the watch had been his father s—I took no note of the conversation but I am quite certain he said so—it was on the second occasion when I took him into custody MRS WATSON re-examined This is my husband s watch Cross-examined Q What do you estimate to be its worth A It cost twelve guineas fifteen years ago HARRIS WATSON I have had this watch about fifteen years—there is no particular mark on it—I swear to it—I know it by the outside and inside both and I know the maker s name perfectly well but not the number—I have applied to the maker for the number and he cannot give it me—I have seen it daily

some short time afterwards and said You had better have it you will never have such a bargain again you can buy it for 1l that she said Certainly it is very cheap if it is only to cut it up for bonnets and she gave the money to Packer and he took it down stairs to the party—to the best of my recollection that was all she stated about the gown—I do not think I have omitted any thing—Packer did not say any thing—I asked Sayer whether the shawl was hers—she said it was she had purchased it for 7s of a woman as I understood her at her house—I think she said the woman s name was Clark—I think I asked who it was—I took them into custody—on the way to the station a woman came up and put her face under Sayer s bonnet—after she had done so Sayer said That is the woman I purchased the shawl of —the woman said No I am sure you did not you purchased it of my husband —that was all that occurred to the best of my recollection— Packer said nothing to me Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q

t18420822-2454  2454 JOHN WINNINGTON was indicted for feloniously receiving on the 1st of June 1500 ermine skins value 65l the goods of George Henry Schacht MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JOHN CHARLES I am clerk to George Henry Schacht a skin merchant in George-street Mansion-house Between Saturday 27th and Monday 29th of November last his warehouse was broken open and a large quantity of skins stolen—there were 155 bundles of ermine skins lost—they were tied in bundles—there were 25 bunt as of dressed worth from 37s to 50s per timber of 40 skins and the rest were raw worth from 35s to 40s per timber—there are only three other houses in London which import skins of that sort I have been fifteen years with Mr Schacht and eight years with another merchant—in June last I had information from Ellis and Everington—I went to their shop in St Paul s Church-yard—I was there shown six and a half timbers of ermine skins—I have no hesitation in laying they were part of those stolen from Mr Schacht from their quality—part of them had been in the warehouse nearly three years EVAN MEREDITH I am in the employ of Messrs Ellis and Everington of St Paul s Church-yard On Saturday the 18th of June a person named Bull came to our house he had been in our employ from eight to ten years before he produced 4 dressed and 4 undressed skins as a sample and asked if we bought such things—he said he had about 10d timber of them—he wanted 27s for the dressed and 25s for the undressed—I said I must see the bulk—he said he would show me timber dressed and asked if I would purchase them first he would show me the others afterwards—having heard of Mr Scratch s robbery I made a communication to them and an appointment was made for Bull to come again which he did in half an hour accompanied by the prisoner—they brought these 6 timber of ermine skins—Bull introduced the prisoner to me as the owner of the skins—he told me he was a Sir John Winning ton who bad made a purchase of them—in consequence of something which had passed between me and Mr Charles I went on to buy these timbers for 25s —this invoice was made out—the prisoner wrote it—I asked for some reference to be given and a Mr Bartholomew of New Inn was given—the prisoner and Bull then went away On Monday the 20th the prisoner brought a timber of undressed skins—he said that was a sample of 31 timbers and 25s was mentioned as the price—I told him I could not buy them unless I saw the whole of them—he went to fetch them immediately—he returned without them and said he was too late he could not see the party and be could not bring them that day—an appointment was made that he was to bring them on the 24th of June—in the mean time I received a letter from Bull—after the receipt of it I went to a public-house—I found no one there —On the 24th of June the prisoner brought 30 timbers of undressed—22s was bargained for as the price of the whole of them—I made him that offer and he accepted it—I proceeded to count the skim and while they were being counted I sent to Mr Schacht s place and Mr Charles came to the place—he stated in the prisoner s hearing that he believed they were his property and that they were stolen from their premises—the prisoner said they were his property and he would not give account of them—he was then taken into custody—Messrs Ellis and Everington use these skins in their business—about three persons in London import these skins Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did the prisoner give you his address A Yes No 34 Elliott-row Lambeth—I sent to Mr Bartholemew s and found it was perfectly right—his address was correct—Mr Oppenheim Mr Magnum and Mr Schacht are the only persons that sell ermine skins that I know of—I have been in the fur trade about fifteen years—Ellis and Everington do not confine themselves to the fur trade—they sell linens and woollens and other things—we deal very largely in furs—we deal with the three merchants I have mentioned—Sir Wiliam Poland is an importer of skins—I should think last year not above 500 timbers of ermine skins were imported and about 800 the year before—I can always tell by the imports of the Custom-house MR BODKIN Q Have Ellis and Everington a department for skins A Yes and I manage it VITRUVIUS WITCOMB I am warehouseman to the prosecutor I have examined these thirty-one bundles of skins and I find some of them to be cut by myself—I have examined them attentively—I am able to swear they are part of my master s stock—I missed them on the Monday after the robbery—I had seen them about a week before—I had had them in my hand about four times Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Will you give us one of these skins that has your own cut on it A This is one they are cut up the belly to see if there are any moth eggs in it—the skins are not cut when they come over here—it is very likely that other persons cut them as well as I when they suspect there are eggs in them—we cut straight down—no two cuts are alike—I know I cut the skins—we have no occasion to cut them but these being old skins I cut some to see—I do not swear to this one in particular—I cannot say How many cut skins there are in the bundle—I do not cut all—this is a remarkable skin—there is not another like this in the world—it is torn—this skin is damaged—damaged skins are very common—I will swear to this one out of the whole MR BODKIN Q Had you noticed this before A Yes PETER THIRION I am a fur-skin dresser I dress for the prosecutor—these skins have been through my hands as a dresser—I sent home five timbers on the Friday previous to the robbery Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you dress a great many in the course of a year A Yes but last year there was very little done—I did but dress these twenty timbers for Mr Schacht—I dress for five or six persons—there are about four importing houses in the trade—I know these because some of them went in two or three pieces in dressing being old skins and I was obliged to put these pieces together again—they passed through my hands three or four times and went to pieces several times—I do not suppose there ever was such a lot of skins in the trade for these six years MR BODKIN Q Is it general in the importing houses to dress them A There are two or three retailers who buy and dress them MR BODKIN or do retailers them FREDERICK AUGUSTUS SCHROETBB I am in the employment of Oppenheim and Co who are importers of these skins—there are only two or three more importers—I have compared some of these skins with skins remaining at Mr Schachts and to the best of my belief they are of the same bulk Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q That is a mere speculation A This is a very remarkable lot of skins—they are so damaged and stained that I should think that any man who had to do with them might know them HENRY SCHACHT I am an importer of skins of this kind—I have examined these skins and I have no doubt in my mind that they are my property—these skins are generally bought from the importers by for manufacturers—the value of these undressed skins is from 30s to 40s a timber and the dressed ones about 10s a timber more WILFRED CALLENDER I am porter to Ellis and Everington On the 18th of June I was sent to Mr Schacht with a message—after I had returned home the prisoner and Bull came there—when they went out I was desired to follow them which I did—they went a little way down Ludgate-street and then turned back and went a little way along St Paul s Church-yard then went back and went down Dean s-court across Carter-lane and down Addle-hill and into the Bell where they waited about half-an-hour—they came out went up Addle-hill along Shoemaker-row to the Broadway Blackfriars through a court on to Ludgate-hill—they then went about 100 yards turned back and came up to Stationers -hall-court up Warwick-lane on to Newgate-market across the market through a passage between two public-houses—they went into one public-house and through into Newgate-street and there I lost them—when they came out of Ellis and Everington s door there was another person waiting for them and he went with them to the public-house where they waited half-an-hour but he did not come out with them Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you go into the house where they waited half-an-hour A No because they had seen me in the warehouse and they might have known me if I had followed them FRANCIS M CLEAN I am a police-officer I took the prisoner into custody at Elliott s-row Lambeth in the front attic which is a small room—there was no warehouse or appearance of business GUILTY Aged 45 — Transported for Seven Years

knowing the same to have been stolen against the Statute &c MESSRS CLARKSON and PAYNE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM BENSON STONES I am a Manchester-warehouseman and live in Warwick-street Golden-square On Saturday night the 22nd of April I went into the warehouse and chained up the dog—I left the warehouse and the property in it perfectly safe—next morning I went again into the warehouse and heard a knocking on the wall—the property appeared safe—about half-past seven o clock on Monday morning I went into the warehouse again to the spot where I had heard the knocking the previous day and discovered a hole in the wall that led into a coach-maker s next door—I then examined my warehouse and missed 300 yards of silk serge and laventines worth about 424l Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Have you any partners A No—I heard the knocking between eleven and twelve o clock—I am quite clear as to that—there is nothing to separate my premises from the coach-maker s but this wall where I heard the knocking JOHN HIBBARD I am a labourer in the employ of Mr Kempster a coach-maker in Warwick-street On Sunday the 23rd of April I was at my master s place from nine o clock till a quarter to one—the premises were all safe then and I left it double locked—at a quarter-past six next morning I went there and found the factory door only once locked—I found a hole in Mr Stone s wall about three feet one way and two the other big enough for a man to go through Cross-examined Q Have you your hearing very well A No—I know I left at a quarter before one o clock because I looked at the public-house clock opposite and the people at the Catholic chapel were leaving—the hole was in the down stairs room—if there had been any hole in the wall then I must have seen it—I was the whole of that time in the doorway which leads immediately to the room where the hole was—I never saw the prisoner there NICHOLAS PEARCE I am an inspector of the A division of police On Wednesday afternoon the 24th of May I saw Dafton at the bottom of Holborn-hill—I followed him to the prisoner s house in Goswell-street—he has a shop for manufacturing fringe—there was a quantity of fringe in the shop and tassels and other things in the window—Dafton went into the shop—he remained there twenty minutes and came out with a roll of silk serge—I followed him into Bardwell and Co s shop at the bottom of Holborn-hill—I went there too—I asked him what he had under his arm—he said Silk —I told him who I was and took the parcel from him—this is it—I left him in charge of a constable at Bardwell s—I then went to the prisoner s house—the prisoner was standing at the door—when I asked if his name was Lovell he said Yes —I walked into the shop and asked if he knew a man named Dafton—he said No —I asked if he had sold any silk to a person of that name that day—he said No he had not—I asked if he had sold any silk to any other person that day—he said No he had not—I told him I was an officer and I should search his house—he said You shall not do it without a warrant —he said he did not know me and he should send to the station for the inspector—I said I will send out for a constable —I did so and one presently came in—I was in plain clothes and the constable did not know me—presently a second constable came in mentioned my name and told the prisoner who I was—I then began to search in a back room adjoining the shop—I found there four pieces of silk serge covered over with a piece of cloth—they were brought into the shop and placed by the side of the counter—the prisoner said they belonged to another man—I said Perhaps you will tell me who that man is —he said I shall answer no questions it is not your place to ask questions —I made a further search in a box under the shop window and found these forty-seven yards of brown silk—I found a coat in the back room and in the pocket of it I found this pocket-book with the things which are now in it Cross-examined Q What did Dafton tell you he had given a yard for this silk A 1s 9d —I had not known the prisoner at all before—I perceived that he was a little hard of hearing—there was a counter in the shop and the box was inside the counter—I did not see any shopwoman there JOHN HAYNES police-inspector A division On the 25th of May I went to the prisoner s house—I found twenty-four patterns of silk serges behind a nest of drawers in the front shop in a piece of very thin brown paper among a quantity of rubbish loose papers and other things crammed behind the drawers—on the day before when I was there with Pearce we found a large quantity of bitter aloes nutmegs isinglass Prussian blue silk drawers cotton stockings and boots in different parts of the house—on the 25th I found twenty-four pairs of silk stockings among a quantity of rags under the counter Cross-examined Q When was the first time you gave this account about the nutmegs and drawers and stockings A To-day—I was a chemist and druggist before I was a policeman—I thought it a marvellous thing to find silk drawers and stockings in such a place MR PAYNE Q Where did you find these silk drawers A Among a quantity of rags under the bed in the kitchen and twenty-four pairs of cotton stockings were among some rubbish in a sort of basket under the counter—some of the silk drawers were in the different cupboards and corners about the parlour JOSEPH WADSWORTH I am foreman to Mr Stones By his direction I made out a list of the stolen articles—I began it on the Monday morning and finished it on the Tuesday and on the Tuesday I sent the list down to the station in Vine-street Cross-examined Q Did you make it out from information from other parties A From deficiencies in the stock but I went through the books myself and the silks too—a man helped me to trace the different numbers—I went through the whole of the silks—we had the stock-book which is entered up by different parties and I have no doubt it is correct—I act upon it—I made out the greater part of these entries not all of them—all the parties in the warehouse are likely to enter them—they are not all here COURT Q Have you any mode of telling of your own knowledge the loss sustained that night A Yes—I know where they were placed—I went round the shop and saw the places where property was missing—I did not know before that what property was there except from the stock-book—there were fifty-five ends and pieces missing—there are three persons in the employ besides me—I can say from my own knowledge without going through the book that we lost from forty to fifty pieces of silk serge which were safe on Saturday night and were gone on Monday morning—I have seen this piece of brown serge in custody of Pearce—it is Mr Stone s—I saw this piece of drab serge in the possession of Pearce—it is Mr Stone s—I have seen the other pieces produced by the policeman—we had pieces of silk of this description and pattern on Mr Stone s premises—I believe all these pieces to be his Cross-examined Q How many pieces do you profess to identify A There are five pieces which I have gone through—the lengths correspond as nearly as possible with those we lost—I have no other mark on them—I only know them by the quantity and colour—this drab would be about 2s 3d a yard at a fair wholesale price—the retail price would be from half-a-crown to 2s 8d SAMUEL DAFTON A prisoner I was committed by the Magistrate upon this charge—I have known the prisoner about four years About a month ago to-morrow I met him in Aldersgate-street near where he lives—after saying How do you do he stopped and said I think I have something that will suit you as you are in the woollen line I have got some silk serge that you might sell they are used by the tailors and drapers those who buy cloth will buy them you might sell them when you are selling your cloth —I said they were out of my line I did not deal in them generally but perhaps I might sell as I was passing round when I was out on my own business if he would give me some patterns—he said would I call and look at them—I said Yes when I came back from the City or on the following morning —I then left him—I called at his shop the following morning and he showed me four or five pieces of silk serge in the parlour—he said these were the things that he had mentioned to me the day before—I asked the price and he told me 2s 3d —I said If you like to cut me patterns I will take them with me and see if I can sell them —he cut me patterns from the end of each and I took them with me—I asked him if they were cheap—he said Yes very cheap —I called at Messrs Bardwells and showed them the patterns—they would not give me the price I asked—I called on the prisoner as I came home in the evening—I told him I had shown them but they were too high—then he said he would take 2s for them—he said they were very cheap—I said I did not know but I thought by what they said they were not cheap—I called at Messrs Bardwells again and they offered me 1s 11 1/2 d a yard for them—I went back to the prisoner and told him I might sell them if he would take 1s 9d —that was for two pieces only—he said if I would get him the money he would take that for the two pieces—I said I can give you 1s 9d for these two which were the two that Bard well had offered me 1s 11 1/2 d for—one was a black and the other a brown—he said he would take that price if I could sell him the lot he had there—I said I did not know whether I could or not—he showed me four or five pieces—I said If you will let me have these two at 1s 9d I will keep the patterns of the others which I have got and endeavour to sell them —he said he would let me have the two at 1s 9d and I was to endeavour to sell the others—I gave him the money—I borrowed the money to pay for them and then I took them to Bardwells and sold them to them—I called on the prisoner again and gave him the patterns back of the other three and said I could not sell them—he said Very likely if you look in in the morning I shall have two or three others of different colours —I looked in on the following morning and he had three or four pieces more—he said Here are some fresh ones can you do anything with them —I said I don t know but cut me patterns I will try —I said You have a good many of them —he said No they are not many they are a few I have taken from a customer of mine instead of money —I called at Bardwells and said Here are some fresh ones —I sold them two more at 1s 10 1/2 d —they said they thought they were not so good—I paid the prisoner 1s 9d for them—he wanted to know if I could not sell the others—I said I do not know but if you let me keep the patterns as I am about town I will try and sell them —he said I wish you could sell them as I want the money for them you will be down in the City to-morrow morning —I said Very well —on the following day but one I called and saw him—he then said he had two or three more—those I had the patterns of were gone—I said You have sold them —he said Yes I believe they are gone —I took out the patterns and said They are of no use to me then —he said he had another piece or two and that was all—he said There is one here which is of a superior price to the others I won t take less for this than 2s 3d —I said It does feel stouter give me a pattern of it and I will try to sell it —he said I wish you would try to sell the whole of them —I said Give me a pattern of that that seems to be better —I took the patterns and sold one to Mr Lowe for 2s 1d —I had told Lovell before that the two last I had sold at 1d a yard less than the others and I said Let me have that at the same price as the others —he said Well well sell that I don t think we shall be very nice about 1d a yard and I paid him 1s 9d —there were two or three left—he said What do you say to these —I said I don t know if I have the patterns I will try to sell them —I think they were different to what I had seen before—I had the patterns of one of them and showed them to several persons—I could not sell them—I could not get above 1s 6d for them—I called on Bartram again and sold them another for 1s 10d —I paid the prisoner 1s 9d for it—he said he had got four pieces more left—he said There are these left they are all I have got —I said I will see what I can do with the drab and I took it directly to Bardwell and showed it them—a man who I did not know came up to me and said What have you got there and I told what it was Cross-examined Q Where do you live A In Brewer-street St John-street-road opposite Sadler s-wells—I am a housekeeper—I have lived there six or seven years—I have no lodgers—I carry on the woollen business—I am a woollen agent—I have no warehouse but I have a place in the City at my sister s—if I have occasion to send goods I send them there and if I have goods from the country I have them there—my sister keeps a boarding-house in Basinghall-street—it is in part of her house that I deposit my goods—in different rooms generally on the landing and latterly in a little room behind which they generally call my warehouse—it is a room where I frequently put things—I have not deposited any goods there for some time—it may be a month or longer—I have little occasion for a warehouse—I have been in prison all this time on account of this silk—my son makes a quantity of fancy writing-desks and sends them there for me to sell and I have hundreds of pounds worth of goods sent there—if my son has any desks on hand I endeavour to sell them—I deal in nothing else but woollens—I have sold Isces for Mr Hall of Montague-street Spitalfields during the last twelve months—I have exchanged cloth with him for laces to the amount of 200l or 300l —I deal with two or three persons in the country for cloth—I deal with Maltby of Leeds—I have sold many goods for him—I think he lives in Basinghall-street Leeds—I direct to William Maltby of Leeds —I deal with Mr Shamacher a wool-merchant in Thames-street—I did business with him within a month before I was taken—I never sold any silk serge before I met the prisoner—I have sold silk—nine or ten months ago I had two or three remnants of silk—I bought them at a sale—I have not sold 10l worth of silk for these twenty years—I do not suppose I have bought 20l or 40l worth of silk in my life or had three dealings in silk—I do not recollect having any dealings in silk for seven or eight years to my knowledge—when I went for the piece of drab silk I saw the prisoner at his house—that is true—I did not come into the shop and inquire for Mr Lovell and Mrs Lovell did not tell me he was not at home—I do not recollect seeing her that morning—I did not take any silk into that shop only the patterns—I do not know a gentleman of the name of Anderson—I did not show Mrs Lovell the silks and she did not ask me to leave them to show to her husband—I did not take into Mrs Lovell s shop on the 24th of May a parcel in a coarse wrapper and say I had a nice cheap lot of serge I should like to sell her—she did not say her husband was not at home—I did not say Give me leave to show them to you they are worth the money nor put the parcel on the counter and say they were silk serges I could sell at 2s 3d a-yard—she did not say she would have nothing to do with them I might call again when her husband was at home Q Did she not say to you after whispering with a gentleman that she would give 2s 2d for the black but would not have the colours as they were of no use A No—I did not at first refuse and afterwards agree to let her have them at 2s 2d nor ask for a pair of scissors to cut the samples nor ask her to let me leave them for two or three hours and that I would then let her know—I did not pull out a small paper parcel and tell her to throw it into the fire and say they were patterns of goods which I had sold and they were of no use—she did not in my presence give them to the children—I saw a girl in the shop and I think Mrs Lovell was in the shop once or twice during the whole of the times I called there—she was not there on the day I had the drab silk—when I took this piece of drab silk I saw a girl in the shop and I saw Mr Lovell in the parlour—I stood in the shop and pulled out the patterns and I said There Mr Lovell what about this I can sell this —that was the drab one—he said Come in here —I walked into the parlour behind the shop and then this conversation took place in the parlour about the drab—I told Mr Bardwell they had been taken in exchange for goods not that I had taken them—I said at the time of the examination that that was a mistake—I did not tell Mr Lowe that I had taken them in exchange for goods—I said they had been taken in exchange for goods—I did not tell either Bardwell or Lowe that I had taken them in exchange for goods—I have been engaged in the cloth business forty-five years out of forty-eight—I was apprenticed in the trade—I worked in it when I was between three and four years old—I had a warehouse in Basinghall-street from 1818 till 1822—I gave it up because business was bad—I failed and took the benefit of the Act in 1825 I think—I have done so twice but it was for the same thing—there was something left out the first time I took it—there were some goods that were sent in and were omitted to be put down and thus after six months I had to go through the course again—I was opposed by a party who had sent in some goods which I objected to take—there they lay and when I had taken the benefit of the Act the man sued me for these goods—he would not take them and I gave them up to the Court—the man made himself assignee and took those very goods—I have not been very intimate with the prisoner—I never had a quarter of an hour or ten minutes chat with him in my life before this—I have known him about four years—during all that time he has lived and carried on business in the same place MR PAYNE Q When you went from Mr Bardwell s to the prisoner on the day the policeman saw you did you carry any parcel in A No I came out with one containing this drab silk—I have never been charged with any criminal offence or ever been in custody in my life GEORGE NELSON I am porter to Mr Stones—I know this piece of brown silk serge—I saw it on my master s premises on the 19th of April—there are my initials on it—I saw this piece of drab silk serge safe on the 19th of April—here are my fellow-servant s initials on it—these were a part of the stock that were missing when I examined the stock-book—from my knowledge of the business I believe these other pieces produced are Mr Stone s—he had serge of the same pattern and quality and appearance on his premises just before the robbery Cross-examined Q By what do you identify the two pieces A This one by my own initials—my initials were placed on this on the 25th of Nov when these pieces were sent out by me and entered in the approbation-book to a gentleman named Dewey—I can say I saw them on the 19th of April from an examination of the pattern-book which it is my duty to do—I checked them off as being in stock—seven or eight persons are on the premises and we all serve occasionally CHARLES LONG I am shopman to Mr Stones—I know this piece of drab silk serge—I put my initials on it on the 19th of April when it was sent out to Mr Rennells—it came back on the 21st but I did not observe it then JOSEPH BARTRAM I am a partner in the firm of Bardwell and Co Holborn-bridge—I remember Dafton coming to me on the 20th of May—he brought three patterns of levantine and serge two of which I bought of him—forty-eight yards of black serge and eighty-eight yards of brown levantine at 1s 11 1/2 d per yard—on the 23rd of May I purchased of him ninetythree yards and three-quarters of black levantine and fifty-three yards and three-quarters of brown levantine at 1s 10d —they came to 13l 10s 5d —I paid him 13l 10s 4d —on the 24th I bought a length of black serge of him under the direction of Inspector Pearce— I had communicated with Mr Stones and had an interview with Mr Pearce the night before —I asked Dafton if he had any drab serge—he went away and returned in about an hour and brought this drab serge which I had bought of him under his arm—Mr Pearce followed him into the shop and took him there after I had bought the black serge of him and he went away to fetch the drab—he had no parcel with him at all—he brought me patterns Cross-examined Q How much did you pay him altogether A I think 31l odd—I bought four different lots—he told me he had taken them in barter—I am sure of that MR PAYNE Q Can you be certain whether he said he had taken them in barter or that they had been taken A I understood him to say that he had taken them in barter—I would not swear positively to it but that is my impression—I took it for granted that they were his own saying he took them in barter NICHOLAS PEARCE re-examined I followed Dafton from Mr Bardwell s to Lovell s—he took no parcel in with him but brought this one out SAMUEL LOWE I am a tailor and live in Barbican On Tuesday the 23rd of May I bought some serge of Dafton at 2s 1d a yard—I paid him 10s 6d for it Cross-examined Q Did he tell you he had taken it in exchange for other goods A Yes I am sure of that—he asked me 2s 3d —I offered him 2s —he said it cost him 2s —I then said I will give you a penny a yard profit —he then showed me a pattern of brown serge and asked me to purchase that—I said it did not suit me DAVID MITCHELL I live in Cloth-fair and deal in woollens On the 22nd of May I bought two pieces of serge of the prisoner consisting of 200 yards together—I paid him 20l for them at 2s a yard—I have known him three or four years and am acquainted with his writing—I have a bill of his hand writing—I think I have never seen him write—he has sometimes made out bills at our warehouse and sometimes sent them—I have acted with him in business on those bills which he has written at my warehouse—I settled with him on the faith of this writing—it is not the writing of any one in my employment—the prisoner s signature is put to this bill of parcels and to all of them and I have acted upon them Q Look at this account which was found in the pocket-book in the prisoner s room and from the knowledge you have acquired by what you have told us what is your opinion about it A I believe it is the prisoner s writing—the figures on this other paper I should not believe to be his—this other paper looks more like his writing—if this had come to me from him I should have thought it was his writing Cross-examined Q Suppose you had seen this if it had been lying on my desk could you have expressed any belief about it A I then could not have said—if I had seen it at the other end of the town I should not have expressed my opinion that it was the prisoner s writing—I know he can write—I saw him take the pen and write but I did not stand over him to see him mark a letter—I thought him a respectable man—I was introduced to him by a person named Dafton who had shown us some samples of woollen goods—I never dealt with Dafton for silks—the prisoner did not tell me the silks were selling for another person—I bought them in our warehouse—the prisoner brought samples first and there was some dispute about the price—I am not quite certain whether he said that before he could part with them at any price he must consult another person—he said he did not think the price could be taken GEORGE THOMAS I believe these pieces of silk produced by Mr Mitchell are what I sold to Mr Stones on the 7th of April—I sold him two lengths then and they are the same quality and pattern and every thing the same Cross-examined Q I believe you are clerk to your brother who lives in Neville s-court Milk-street A Yes—he is in a large way of business—there were but two pieces of this description in our warehouse—very likely there are some thousands of yards—I know this by the selvedge and by the character of the piece—the manufacturer had about eighteen pieces of it—I know this piece so well it is the fellow-piece to what Mr Lowe has WILLIAM BENSON STONES re-examined I have looked at all this property—I had property of this description in pattern and quality on my premises at the time of the robbery and missed property of this description immediately after—I believe this is mine and was on my premises at the time of the robbery HENRY FRY I am in the employ of Mr Stones I am acquainted with his stock generally—it strikes me that I have seen this one produced by Mr Mitchell before—this piece of drab I can identify as his—I saw it on his premises on the 21st of April JAMES WADSWORTH Those patterns that were found in the prisoner s house I believe to be patterns of part of the stock lost by Mr Stones—I have compared them with the articles—they correspond MR WILKINS called THOMAS ANDERSON I live in Victoria-row Pimlico I keep a shop and sell Berlin wool and am in the silk woollen and trimming trade—I sell fancy goods in general—I have an agreement for a lease of my premises—I pay 116l a-year rent—I have known the prisoner between sixteen and seventeen years and have been in the habit of dealing with him—on the 24th of May between eleven and twelve in the forenoon I went for an order which I had given to be done by twelve o clock—some gimp fringe and tassels and buttons and sleeve-ties—it was not completed and I waited in consequence of it—I saw a person come in to the prisoners with a bundle under his arm—I saw the bundle opened and it contained silk serge—there were two colours and black—one of the colours was a kind of drab but I did not look at the coloured ones at all—the others were black—Mrs Lovell was present when I went into the shop and the person who came asked her whether Mr Lovell was at home—she said No he is not —he said he wanted to see him as he had got a job of serges which he could sell cheap—he could sell them at 2s 3d a-yard if she would take the whole—she said she did not want any—I saw the colours at a distance but the black I looked at and handled and I felt disposed to make a purchase of them—I nodded to Mrs Lovell and went towards the parlour—she followed me—I told her if she would buy the black I would not mind giving 2s 3d a-yard for them—I did not want the coloured it was no use to me—the whole six pieces of serge were then left—he had asked 2s 3d a-yard for them—Mrs Lovell offered him 2s 2d for the black after what I had told her and he said he would take it—he asked for scissors and cut some samples off but whether he cut from them all I cannot say but I know he cut some from both the colours and from the black—after he had cut off these patterns he said he did not know whether he could part them but if she would allow him to leave them there he would let her know in an hour or two whether he could sell the black without the colours—Dafton has very much the appearance of the man but I could not say positively that it is him my eye-sight is very bad—to the best of my belief he is the man—I used my glasses to look at the serge—after the patterns were cut off the man gave Mrs Lovell something wrapped up in a piece of brown paper—I do not know what it was—he said they were some patterns of goods that had been sold and done with—they were of no use to him and Mrs Lovell might put them behind the fire—Mrs Lovell s little child who was behind the counter said Mother give it me for my doll —I did not see her give the bundle to the child—it was on the counter—the man then went away—the shopwoman was in the shop at the time—Mrs Lovell took up these pieces of serge and put them on one side at the further end of the counter—they were there when I left MR PAYNE Q How long have you kept your shop A Six months—before that I kept the Black Horse at the corner of Black Horse-yard in the Dover-road—I kept that about two years—it is twelve months ago—I left it because I was burnt out—between that time and the last six months I was out of business entirely—I had been in the public line fourteen or fifteen years—I kept the Rum Puncheon in Old-street—about eighteen months—before that I lived in Southampton-street Fitzroy-square for five years with my son who keeps an oil shop—I was then dealing in silks and trimmings of all kinds and serges occasionally—I did not get acquainted with Lovell by selling serges but by his doing work for me sixteen years ago—when I was at my son s I had a warehouse on the first floor—I had been nine years at Chelsea and went from there to Southampton-street—I kept the Pitt s Head in the Grange-road for eleven months twenty years ago—I have never been anything else—I attend sales by auction—I never had anything to do with the law—it was between eleven and twelve o clock in the morning that the man came to the prisoner s—I know it was not twelve because I got the goods I was waiting for and in coming across Clerkenwell-green it struck twelve—Mrs Lovell was behind the counter and the man stood in front—the shopwoman was behind the counter and backwards and forwards to a table—the man had a hat on—he did not take it off at all—I had my hat on—I believe I did not take it off—I was sitting on a leather seated chair just by the window—it was not an arm chair—Mrs Lovell asked me to sit down as I was waiting for the work—the serges that the man brought were wrapped up in folds—I should say they were worth from 2s 6d to 2s 9d a-yard—there were six pieces and I bid money for four—perhaps the six pieces might be worth 60l —I do not know—I did not buy them because they were offered to Mrs Lovell—I did not want to take them from her—she told him he must call again when her husband came in—the prisoner is a fringe and trimming manufacturer—I have sold him silks and worsteds—I went before the Magistrate on the second time and the solicitor told me he had no hearing but was remanded for a third examination—I went up then but did not offer myself because the attorney spoke to the Magistrate—I did not tell him I could show where the prisoner got this because the attorney said the Magistrate was determined to commit the prisoner—so I was merely like a bystander MR WILKINS Q Was it in consequence of some information from the solicitor or the prisoner that you went there A Yes—I was ready to give my evidence ELIZA THOMAS I am the wife of James Thomas and am shopwoman to the prisoner I saw the last witness come to the prisoner s shop on Wednesday the 24th of May—he was there about ten o clock in the morning—while he was there Mr Dafton came in and asked if Mr Lovell was at home—Mrs Lovell said no—Dafton had a parcel in a coarse wrapper under his arm and he said he had a nice cheap job lot of serges that he should like to sell her—she said her husband was not at home and she could say nothing to it—Dafton said Give me leave to show them to you —he laid the parcel on the counter and opened the silks—I could see that they were silks of the same sort as these—I did not hear him mention exactly the price—he said he would sell her them cheap—I saw Anderson whisper to Mrs Lovell at the end of the counter and then she told Dafton that if he liked to take 2s 2d for the black she would buy them but would not have the colours at any price—he did not say whether he would let her have them or not—he then asked for a pair of scissors and they were handed over to him—he cut off some of the ends of the silks then asked her to let him leave the silks there for two or three hours till he returned and he would then let her know whether he could separate the black from the colours—he then produced a paper with some small pieces of silk in it—he said they were patterns of goods he had sold—they were of no use and he asked her to burn them—she gave them to the child and told her to burn them—Dafton then went away and Mrs Lovell put the silks on a shelf at the end of the counter— after Anderson was gone a little girl three years old one of the children came in and brought some pieces of silk and in consequence of what she said I put the pieces of silk in a beaufet—Mr Lovell came home about four o clock—Dafton came back about four—he saw Mrs Lovell and told her he had sold the drab and she might have the black at her price—she called Mr Lovell—Dafton and him were together in conversation in the shop—Mr Lovell said he must measure the silk—Dafton said he was going to take the drab and he would return shortly—the drab was on the counter—he then wrapped it up and took it away with him—Mr Lovell put the blacks at the end of the counter and Mrs Lovell afterwards put them in the parlour as they were in the way—Dafton told me that he would leave the brown silk till he came back and I put it into a box under the show board in the shop—I left between four and five o clock as I was ill being near my confinement—on the solemn oath I have taken every thing I have said is true MR PAYNE Q How often had you seen Dafton before A I have seen him several times in the shop talking with Mr Lovell—he had been there a few days before—I do not know how often—I do not know whether I had seen him there several times within the course of four or five days before—I cannot say that he had not been there—I am there from nine o clock till nine—I sometimes have my meals there and at other times at home—my husband is a stone-mason—I do not know of any silk drawers being among some rags under a bed—I will not swear there were not some under a bed in the kitchen—I was not there when the officer searched the place—there are boxes with the children s clothes in under the bed in the kitchen—I could not swear there were not rags there—there were a few pairs of stockings there—I did not see twenty-four pairs—I will not swear they were not there—I never saw any aloes or nutmegs there MR WILKINS Q You have been asked whether Dafton had been there several times in the course of a few days A I had not seen him many times—I have been engaged in this trade all my life—it is very common for a man to take hosiery in exchange for trimmings—I have known Mr Lovell five or six years—during the whole time he has borne the character of a respectable shopkeeper COURT Q Where was Mrs Lovell when Dafton came into the shop A Assisting me to get an order off—she was behind the counter and so was I—Dafton was on the other side of the counter and Anderson was on the other side of the counter waiting for some work—he was sitting part of the time—I am not related to Lovell Samuel Gogay a silk and cotton bobbin seller James Wingfield a saddler Long-lane Thomas Crossley warehouseman Falcon-square Edwin West warehouseman Fore-street and Samuel Craig of Surrey-road gave the

paid 1s sometimes 2d 6d sometimes 4d —I searched Mrs Anscomb s house and found the property which I produced on the last indictment—this other property was found at different houses of persons who had bought them—I got this one from Mrs Johnson—I told Mrs Anscomb that I came to take her into custody and asked whether she had bought any dresses—she said Yes the dress my daughter has got on the other is in the drawer which I gave Lodonny 12s for which I considered the full value that is all that I have bought —she said she had had lengths of him such as a yard and a half or two yards for which she

father—I had some conversation with the mother about this dress not with the father—she has sometimes shewn me a pattern and asked me to let her have a dress or two in the course of the week—I am sure of that and she showed me a pattern and I in consequence got her some sometimes and sometimes I did not according as it happened—they were all put down to this account—there was once a slight disagreement with me and Mrs Anscomb about the account—she asked me how much money Henry brought down—I said 2s —she said that he ought to have brought 3s 6d —10s was the last amount I received for these articles—it was put down to the account—I agreed with Henry as to what was to be put down—I told him to tell his mother and he said Very well —he has paid me money himself when I brought him the goods sometimes as high as 15s —I generally brought out the goods under my coat—I never saw the book only when I saw it with the father—it was only a sheet of paper doubled up Cross-examined Q You were rather fond of theatrical amusements A I have been sometimes about once a week—I never performed—I am only acquainted with one actor—I never took any parcels that I stole over Blackfriars-bridge—I never acted at Sadler s-wells or White Conduit-house—Mrs Anscomb said that as they sold so cheap at our place she would try and save some money and come down to the warehouse and buy some there she would try to save up 5l and come down to the warehouse and buy a good parcel—I never told her that I was stealing these things from my masters—I always mentioned the price at which they were to be sold JAMES BRANNAN gave the same evidence as in the former case HENRY ANSCOMB*— GUILTY Aged 16 — Transported for Seven Years FRANCES ANSCOMB— GUILTY —Recommended to mercy Confined Four

house was shut up in the usual way—I did not see it fastened but I was the last person up and I saw it was shut up as usual—next morning I found it had been entered at the back kitchen window by cutting it away—I found my drawing-room deranged and missed a cash-box from an escrutoire which had been shut and locked the night before but the key was left in it—there were twenty-five sovereigns in the cash-box and about 3l in half-crowns—I saw it all safe a few minutes before I went to bed—I was going a journey—I had opened the box and counted the cash—I missed these spoons and tongs and

14 Church-way St Pancras The two prisoners lived in the back room—about a quarter before three o clock in the morning of the 27th of Jan I was in bed and awake—I heard a voice from the back of the premises call Ned and immediately somebody from the back room adjoining to mine went down stairs and let in two or three persons—I am certain there were two persons let in—they went into the prisoners room and shortly afterwards they commenced a great noise as if they were hammering a tin cannister—I listened attentively and could not distinguish their voices from the sound of the tin and as if they were sounding gold and silver—I heard somebody say Now we shall have the 2s 6d or 12s 6d to be divided between us —it was a male voice that said that—I then heard a female say Now I suppose it is all over you will go out of town and a male voice said he thought he should go to Brighton—shortly after we same persons apparently who had been let in left—I did not see any person—they had remained in the room perhaps an hour—as they were going down I heard as if they were taking away the same tin thing that they brought in—the same person who let them out then returned to the room and I heard a rattling which sounded to me like keys—I afterwards heard some policemen pass—I opened my window called them and let them in—I then went into my room—I afterwards went into the back room and saw the prisoners there—I saw this plate which is here—the policeman had this tin box in his hand when I hailed him from my window Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q There was a good deal of talking after the persons came up stairs A Yes—I did not hear a female voice making any strong remarks on what was going on—I heard a female say something about making tea just before the others left—the other parties were in the room three-quarters of an hour or an hour—I was listening the whole time—there appeared to me to be two or three men talking—I did not hear the female talk much—she might talk in a lower tone—I do not recollect hearing her voice above once or twice—I did not bear one of the men say to the female It is no business of yours —when they were going away she said I suppose you are going for a spree —she said I suppose you are going to Portsmouth and a man said No I shall go to Brighton —I did not hear the words Hold your noise —I hare told as much as I heard—the conversation was rapid—I will swear I heard two persons come up to the room and some person call from the back of the premises—there is a street at the back—I heard a person go down and it was a man as far as I could judge—I had been reading till a short time before I went to bed—I came in about ten minutes past twelve o clock—I did not hear anybody go down before some one left the room to let these persons in—I had heard two persons talking in the prisoners room in a quiet manner—everything was as quiet as possible in the house COURT Q Can you tell whether it was a man s step that went down stairs A Yes it was a man s

female searcher which I took to Mr Fordham s and tried to the desk that the waistcoat had been taken from and it fitted it exactly Cross-examined Q Was that all the female prisoner said A It was all

husband s and Carpenter said These aie my property —I took this razor which was close beside him and he said This is my property too —in taking his coat up a glove dropped from it which he said was his property and in searching him at the station I found these ten half-crowns in his right hand breeches pocket and one glove in bis coat pocket—I had found this cash-box about 100 yards from the house before I went there—when I got to the room the female was dressed and the man was dressed all but his coat—there was a bedstead in the room which was turned up—when the woman said they had just got up the man was close to her—they were almost touching one another—I do not think the man said anything when she said that Cross-examined Q The man s coat was hanging up was it not A Yes in the room—I am not certain whether it was on the bedstead or not as the room was rather dark—we had but a small bit of candle and one of our lamps—the man put on his coat which I think was handed to him by a constable—I did not see it hanging close by the prosecutor s coat—I swear that both the prisoners said that there had been no hammering—I swore so before the Magistrate—this is my signature to this deposition— The deposition being read stated The male prisoner said there had been no hammering there Q Do you persist now in swearing that both the male and female said there had been no hammering A

parlour—about four in the morning on the 27th of Jan I was awake and three persons came down stairs—they came along the passage and at the door a strange voice said Good morning and the prisoner

not far from the prisoner—he told him that my mother kept an oil-shop in Bethnal-green-road—she has lived there twenty-five years—when I went to the prisoner I had a pound of tobacco which I had stolen from my mother—I produced it to the prisoner and he said he would give me half-a-crown a pound for it—my mother gave 3s 8d a pound for it—I do not rightly know what it would have been sold for across the counter as I never serve in the shop—the prisoner gave me half-a-crown for it—it was called the best returns—he said if I could get anything he would buy it of me if I could get soap or

introduced to me by a man named Flowerday Mr Carey pray don t take any step of that kind to take me away from my home and I will let you know everything I know about it or any goods that I have bought —I said My information is that you have bought candles at 2d a pound of Brown —he said I have bought a few candles on one or two occasions but I gave him 3d a pound —I said Where is the tobacco you bought —he said I certainly have bought tobacco on two or three occasions small quantities and he had cigars for it but he always told me it was his own —I then said Where is the jar of capers you bought of him —he said well he did bring a small jar of capers and I gave him 10d for it I emptied them and he took the jar away again —he begged very particularly to be allowed to go and have an interview with Mrs Brown—he said he would gladly pay double and treble the amount of her loss if the uncle would not take any step towards him—I desired the uncle while I remained there with the prisoner to go and see Mrs Brown—he went away and returned but not bringing any decisive answer I went and saw Mrs Brown myself and afterwards took the prisoner—I found some candles in this shop which

fellow-workmen—the shop-door was broken open—I went in and found the fire had been lighted—I missed my plane plough chisels and various other things which have not been found—these are part of my tools produced —I saw them again at the station on 13th Aug Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Are they marked A Some of them two or three are not—these chisels have my name on them—West-bourne-terrace is near Hyde-park—my tools are worth about a sovereign—I have had them four or five years in constant use WILLIAM COTTE BOONE I was in the employ of Messrs Thompson and Morgan builders On the evening of 16th June I left my tools at the building some on the bench and some in my basket—I went back that evening with Mitchelmore—the door was broken open and my tools were gone—I have seen some of them since—these two planes are mine—they have my mark on them—I have had them about a year and a half and used them constantly HENRY FULL I am a carpenter I was at work at Westbourne-terrace—I left a quantity of tools at the shop on 16th June—I missed them on Monday 18th June—this plane saw and basket are mine Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Has the basket your name painted on it A No it was new I had bought it three weeks previous—it was a common sort of basket—I would not swear to it I believe it is mine—here is a new piece of cord which I put to it myself—I saw it again on 13th Aug WILLIAM FRANKLIN I am a carpenter and was working at Westbourne-terrace on 16th June—I left a saw there when I left work—I missed it—this is it—it has a peculiar handle and one of the rivets is gone—I have had it three years—I am certain it is mine DANIEL MAY City-policeman 357 I have been in the police eight years—the prisoners were brought to the station on 9th Aug —on that day I went with Green searched No 44 Compton-street and found these tools produced in the top room—it was a sort of lumber-room—the shop is a metal-shop—the name of James Hoare is over the door—I afterwards showed the tools to Hoare and asked him if he could give any account of how he came possessed of them—he said yes he had bought them at different sales and had had them for years but he should decline to answer any more questions—I afterwards showed them to Downer and asked him whether he could give any account of how he came in possession of them—he said Yes I have had them for years I bought them for my son who is a carpenter it has cost me upwards of 70l buying tools on several occasions —I was about to ask him another question when he said I shall not answer any more questions —I had known the prisoners before—I had not known either of them living at that house in Compton-street Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you ask Downer any other question you say you were about to do it A I believe I did—I do not recollect what it was—what I have given is the truth—I am not certain whether I did ask him the question or not—I do not know that it is a very improper course to pursue to get persons out of the cells and ask them questions separately—I thought it was a very proper course—this was not a usual case—I never had such a case before—I should do the same if such a case occurred again Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Where was this property when you showed it to them A In a room at the station—there was a quantity of property beside the tools I have produced here today there were no other carpenter s tools—there were a number of brass tools—I did not point out any particular tools to Hoare but they were lying where he could see them—the carpenter s basket was very large—the other tools were in small parcels about—I believe I was taking a right course in doing this—I am aware that a Magistrate before he questions a prisoner is bound to caution him as to what he says—there was no charge against the prisoners about these things then—I meant to charge them against them if they did not give an answer as to how they came by them—I did not know one word about these tools being stolen—I had not heard the information at that time—I believe there was information because I saw it afterwards in the book—I believe Green was standing by—I do not think he took any part in this—I do not know whether he could hear what was said—he was somewhere about there—I have never done this before—I was not directed to do it I did it out of my own head—I believe there were some complimentary remarks made by the Magistrate about my doing this MR RYLAND Q There was a great deal of other property lying about where did it come from A From No 44 Compton-street—I found a basket amongst other things and it was at the station with all these tools in it ALFRED GREEN City-policeman 376 I found this card on Hoare when I searched him in the station on 9th Aug —it is James Hoare wholesale iron and metal-dealer 44 Compton-street Clerkenwell —I accompanied May to search that house—I assisted him in finding these carpenters tools—I was present at the station and heard May say How do you account for these tools showing him the tools and the other things—Hoare said he had had them for years and purchased them at different times—I heard a similar question asked of Downer and he said he had had them for years and had purchased them for his son and they cost him 70l —in going down to the cell I said Your son —he said Yes Hoare is my son he is a carpenter —I had been to the shop before with Meredith—I found Downer standing behind the counter—I asked him if he was master of the shop—he said Yes —I asked him if his name was Hoare—he said no but he was at my service—Hoare

have an hour s illness before—I had seen my property all safe including this coin on the Sunday before and no one had been in my bedroom but Butler Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Do you know of your own knowledge that this house belonged to the prisoner A No I do not know at all the number of the 10l -note WILLIAM CHARLES POTTER policeman K 212 On 18th April I went to a house in Blue-gate Fields—I saw Butler in bed—I asked her name—she said Williams—I asked her where she came from—she said from Westminster—the prisoner was present and I then asked her how long Butler had been there—she said About a month —I asked her if she knew her—she said No she came there for a lodging—I asked the prisoner if she had seen any money about her—she said she had laid out a few pounds for her while she was in bed—she said she had had wine and gin and oysters and lamb chops—I then asked the prisoner whether she had changed any note—she said No she had not she had not seen one—I then left Butler in custody of another officer as I was not certain she was the woman—I went to Mrs Buckmaster s in Snow s-fields and she came and identified Butler—the prisoner was not in then and I went to look for her—I saw her coming by King David-lane station and I called her in—I said What about the note what have you done with the note —she said I know nothing about it I had no note —I said The old lady says that you had I meant Butler —the prisoner then said I will go up and see her —she went to her own house in Blue-gate Fields to see Butler—I went with her—I then in her presence said to Butler What about the note —Butler said I gave it to the landlady —Gillingham then said she left it at the Royal Sovereign for safety if the old woman should die to put her underground—she did not say that in Butler s presence we were going out of the door at the time—I searched the bed where Butler was lying and there I found three sovereigns four sixpences and two small pieces of silver and this purse which was identified by the prosecutrix—that was all I found in the bed—I did not see the prisoner afterwards on that day—on the 23rd I apprehended her and told her I wanted her for receiving the note knowing it to be stolen—she said she did not know it and she pulled out a pocket-book and gave it me and in it were these pieces of coin—I asked her how she got them—she stated that they belonged to her son and she had had them some time—the prosecutrix identified them—I am quite clear that the coins that she said belonged to her son were what are identified by the prosecutrix—she distinctly identified one and she says she had such a piece as the other—I then said to the prisoner They have missed some foreign coin —she then said It was swept up in the house —I found on her one sovereign seven shillings and one penny Cross-examined Q You went to the house on the 18th but did not apprehend the prisoner then but on the 23rd A Yes when the prisoner said she had received the note from Butler and left it at Smith s the Royal Sovereign for safety we were just coming out of the door but Butler might have heard it—Butler did not say anything at that time—she had said immediately before I gave the 10l -note to the woman to mind —I do not know whether the prisoner heard that—I did not learn from Butler in the prisoner s presence that she had given her the note to mind COURT Q Did Butler say anything more about this in the presence of the prisoner A She did not she did not make any defence to the charge she was too far gone in drink and illness beside—one of the girls of the house was giving her wine when I went in—the prisoner said she had been there a month WILLIAM SMITH I keep the Royal Sovereign in Bluegate-fields—I know the prisoner On 16th April she gave me a 10l Bank of England note—she said she had a female acquaintance of hers lodging in her house and she was very ill and she had got a 10l -note COURT Q Did she say she or I A She said she had a female lodger that was very ill who had given her a 10l -note to take care of and she had not got a place she could lock it up for any safety at her own house and she asked me if I would take care of it for her in case she should want necessaries or if she should die that she should be put decently in the ground as she was very ill—I looked at the note and saw the name of Gibson on it—in the course of that day the prisoner came and said the female wanted some refreshment and she had no money would I lend her 10s on the note and I did so and the next day was my brewer s day and I paid that note away with a 10l bill—I was told I ought to get the note back if I could and I went to the Bank and waited some time and I went to the brewers and they sent me to Barnett and Hoare s—I went there but they could not give me the number or date of the note—the prisoner did not come to me afterwards about the note Cross-examined Q When did the policeman come to you A On the 18th I paid the note away on the 17th COURT Q What time on the 16th did the prisoner give you the note A About the middle of the day JURY Q Have you known the prisoner A I have known her some years ever since I have been there COURT to W C POTTER Q Was the money in the purse in the bed A It was in the purse—Butler seemed very ill as if she had been drinking a great deal—the reason I went there was a sailor had lost his jacket and I went in and saw Butler there—the prisoner said there had been a medical man called in to see Butler—I did not hear that from Butler—she was afterwards attended by a medical man a week before she could have her examination HARRIET BUCKMASTER re-examined I had such a medal as this and this other piece I can swear to—when I went there Butler told me that they must have given her stuff to stupify her she had been ill from the time she went in the house—she never had a day s illness when with me GUILTY * Aged 49 — Transported for Ten Years

t18510106-327  327 MOSES BARNETT feloniously receiving 6 lbs weight of indigo value 1l 13s the goods of John Gerard Wich and another MR BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution HENRY SELLERS a prisoner I was fifteen years old last June—I live at 5 Brown s-buildings with my father who is a workman in the East India warehouses I was in the service of Messrs Wich Newman and Co indigo brokers as errand-boy—I had been nine months or a little more in their employ before I saw the prisoner—I first saw him in Oct when I was in Mincing-lane with an errand-boy named Frederick George Woodgate who works for Milner and Co of Hart-street Crutchedfriars—the prisoner said Boy and beckoned to me—I was standing leaning my back against the railings of the Commercial coffee-rooms—he had a basket on his back which he mostly carries with him strapped across his shoulders—I left Woodgate standing against the Commercial coffee-rooms and went to him he was on the opposite side of the street—he came halfway across the road and I went halfway across met him and we walked back to the pavement where he was before—I left Woodgate—the prisoner said to me Boy are you not in the indigo trade —I said Yes —he asked who I was employed by—I said By Messrs Wich Newman and Co —he asked whether they were not some relation to Messrs Wich and Gadsbury of Great Tower-street—I said I believed they were—he asked me whether my master had any old indigo samples for sale—I told him no my master always returned his samples to the warehouses—he stopped to consider and I asked him what he wanted with me—he said Who do you let have your dust meaning indigo dust —I said I had no perquisites it is sometimes the boys perquisites—he said Then you get high wages —I said I did not my wages were 5s a week when I was employed at sale times which lasted a fortnight and if my master wanted me on any other day he gave 1s a day for it—he said That is very low he knew boys smaller than me and not so old who got more money—I said Do you I wish I had a better place but the work is light and my master is very kind to me —he told me he could tell me how I could get more money—I asked How is that —he said Your master has a great many indigo samples down if he has got 100 samples down and you only take one square out of each it only weighs one ounce you will have 100 ounces bring them to me and I will buy them of you —I said An honest penny is worth a silver shilling and I will not do it —at that time Woodgate came up and said Wich I am going we go by our master s names —I said Good bye Mill that was his employer—he went through the sale-rooms which lead from Mincing-lane to Mark-lane—Barnett left me and followed him—I did not see whether he spoke to him I was in a hurry—this was about half-past ten in the morning—I think there were sales going on it was in the middle of sale times but they do not begin until twelve—I had to take some samples from my master s to Mr Milner to be put up in the sale and I had to go to Messrs Mason and Co in Mincing-lane to get some samples—the sale is on the second Tuesday in the month and this was a week after they had begun—I saw him frequently between that time and 6th Dec —I might have seen him to speak to him about three times a week or more but I shunned him as much as I could—it was only when I met with him coming out of a broker s sale-rooms that I used to speak to him—he addressed me he always asked me if I had made up my mind—I saw him on Friday 6th Dec between Hart-street and Crutched-friars—that was not during the sale times the sales were over about four weeks then—I was not in regular employ at that time I had had no work the whole of that week—I was standing thinking and he said What are you breaking your head about when the golden ball is so near your hand —I said Nothing —he asked me whether I had made up my mind—I told him yes and asked him whether I should bring him some down next morning—he said No it is my Shobbosh let me see you down on Monday morning as early as possible —I went to my master s on the Monday to see if there was anything for me to do I called in every morning to see—I went about nine o clock or a quarter past I do not think it was later—I took five pounds of indigo I weighed it— Barnett told me on the Friday afternoon that he lived at 16 Grace s-alley Well s-street Wellclose-square —I took it from a chest under the large table in the show-room put it into two brown-paper parcels and put one into each pocket—there was no clerk there—I took it to Barrett s shop he keeps an old clothes shop—there are clothes in the window which was shut down—there is no appearance of any other trade—the door is half glass and is always shut—I got there about a quarter to ten—I went straight there—Mrs Barnett was standing at the door she opened it directly she saw me and called out Barney without my telling her my errand—the prisoner came from the parlour which is alongside the kitchen—they both open into the shop by glazed doors—Barnett looked round and seeing the servant in the kitchen who could see into the shop he put a pair of trowsers into my hand and said Oh you want a pair of trowsers —I looked at them and did not know what to say—he said Oh if they don t suit you come this way and took me behind the counter where the servant could not see us—there were scales on the floor—I took the indigo out of my pocket untied it and put it into the scale—he weighed it and said there was only 3lbs —I looked down and said there was 5lbs —he said Oh ah I make a mistake —he gave me five shillings for it—I had not made any arrangement with him about it previously—next morning I stole 4lbs more out of the same chest and took it to Barnett—he was standing at the door with a round cap on—it was about ten o clock—the breakfast things were on his table and he showed me a meerschaum pipe—I asked him the price of it and he said he would take 6lbs of indigo for it he would take the 4lbs then and trust to ray generosity to give him the other two—I said he wanted to make too much of a market of me wanting six shillings for a pipe which I could buy for a half-crown any where—he pressed it upon me but I got off it by telling him I did not smoke—he said it was a real meerschaum and very good but it was not—he gave me four shillings for the indigo—his wife came out of the parlour and asked me whether I could get her any saffron I said I would see—she said Because I use it for colouring my soup —I said What instead of turmeric —she said Yes —saffron is 32s per lb —be said he would give me a very good price fourpence an ounce—I don t know the price of turmeric—next afternoon I went to my master s—I had to clean the place up—I did not get any saffron—I looked in the drawers and came across the cochineal drawer—I took 4lbs of cochineal and took it to Barnett—I said he must give me a good price for it was very high in the market the price in the market was from 5s to 7s 6d per lb my master had sold some that morning at 5s —Barnett gave me 1s per lb telling me that it did not fetch more than half a crown in the market—next day I stole 5lbs more of indigo and took it to Barnett—he said You are going on anyhow you are bringing it like a maid drinks —I said I could not do any better I was insolent to him but I don t recollect the words I said—he said Watch it how you are going on for I will split —I forgot to mention that when I was up at the court I was flurried—on Thursday morning Dec 1st I stole some more indigo from another box called the square box—I think it was 10lbs I did not weigh it—I cut some slits in the lining of my coat and put it between the lining and the cloth—I then went into the counting-house and Mr Appel the clerk laid hold of me by the pocket and found what I had got—something then passed between me and my master and while he went out for an officer I helped Mr Appel to mark the indigo with A his initial—I then put them into the bags again—I left one bag there and took the other which weighed 6lbs to Barnett the bags were what I carried my ground-bait in when I went fishing —the officers in plain clothes walked behind me—Barnett was standing at the door—I went in took the bag out of my pocket and gave it to him—he took it behind the counter where the scales were usually kept and gave me four shillings which I kept in my right hand—I only had one penny in my pocket and a pipe—I went out and took off my cap which the officer had told me to do for him to see which house I came out of—I gave the money to Trew Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q Who do you live with A My father and mother—I get my food with them—I am their only child—my father is a coach-painter but works as a labourer in the employ of the East India Company in the docks—before I went into Messrs Wich s employ I was with Mr Hopcroft a newspaper agent of Mincing-lane—I was not turned away from there—I left because the walking was too much for me—I was out of employ about two months before I got into Mr Wich s—I have never been in gaol or ever in a Court either as a witness or a spectator—I did not go and tell my master directly the prisoner first spoke to me about robbing my master—I was excessively indignant—I felt that such a thing was an insult to a virtuous boy—I had never wronged anybody of a pin I thought I had strength enough in my own fortitude to keep away from doing it—I saw my master two hours afterwards—he is very kind to me—I saw my father and mother that night—I did not say a word to them if I had they would have put a stop to it—my father would have taken me directly to my master and taken my master to this Jew and had him brought up and ray father would not have encouraged me in dishonesty—I did not look out for a policeman when I saw the prisoner in Hart-street—I most always saw him in Mincing-lane—there were people about there—I knew about turmeric because I used to live in the same house with some German Jews and used to hear them talk about putting turmeric in their soup—I have heard them say shobbosh for sabbath and knew that it was the regular word—I spent the money Barnett gave me in pastry and foolishness tobacco apples and nuts—I do smoke—I told Barnett I did not because he perforced the pipe on me—he had never seen me smoking FREDERICK GEORGE WOODGATE I live with my father at 6 Hand-court Upper Thames-street and am in the service of Mr Milner indigo broker of Crutched-friars—I know Sellers and the prisoner—I was with Sellers in Mincing-lane and we met the prisoner who beckoned with his head to Sellers from the other side of the way—Sellers and I went half-way over to him—Sellers went to Barnett and I left them and did not speak to him after I saw him speaking to Barnett—I did not say I am going or anything of the sort that I recollect I am not quite sure—I have known Barnett about six months—he has spoken to me three or four times—it was before he spoke to Sellers—he has not spoken to me on the subject of Sellers and his employers Cross-examined Q What time of day was this A Between twelve and one o clock I think I am not certain—I knew then that Barnett lived at Grace s-alley Wellclose-square he had told me so—when I used to meet him it was in Mincing-lane Hart-street and Crutched-friars—I do not know that he used to attend sales GEORGE APPEL I am clerk to John Gerard Wich and Co he has only one partner they are commission-merchants at 11 Bury-court St Mary-axe Sellers was in their occasional employ as errand-boy he had access to the room where the sample boxes were kept—my suspicions were aroused by some cochineal being missed and on 12th Dec about half-past nine o clock I stopped Sellers coming down from the sampling-room and told him to take out what he had in his pockets—he took out this indigo and made a communication to me—I marked it and gave him back a portion of it in a bag—Mr Wich had gone for an officer and we followed Sellers to Barnett s shop—the prisoner was standing there with a white hat on—Sellers went in—I passed the house but could not see what was going on in the shop—the prisoner followed Sellers in directly—in two or three minutes Sellers came out and went towards the officers—in about two minutes I followed the officers into the shop and saw the prisoner in his back-parlour standing looking at some indigo which was in a scale on a chair by the fireplace Cross-examined Q You did not hear him Ray anything A No I think something passed but I was about five steps behind the officers and I cannot hear very well—I had marked each piece of indigo by Mr Wich s directions—the wholesale price of it is 5s 6d or 6s per lb GEORGE TREW City-policeman 26 On 12th Dec Mr Wich applied to me and I saw some indigo marked—I and Mr Appel and another officer then followed Sellers to Grace s-alley—I and the other officer watched from inside a public-house opposite and saw Sellers go into the prisoner s house he remained in two or three minutes came out and pulled his cap off with his left hand which we had arranged that he should do if he sold the indigo—I went across to him and found 4s in his hand—we then went into the shop and into the back-parlour—the boy went in first—I was close by him and saw the prisoner standing with a scoopscale with some indigo in it examining it—I said Mr Barnett I want that indigo that you have bought of this lad —he said Here it is I have not bought it the boy has left it —I said The boy says he sold it to you for 4s and I have got the money —he made no reply—I said we were officers in plain clothes and we must take him in charge and search his place—he said You are welcome to search —I took the indigo it was the same that had been marked—the shop appeared outside to be an old clothes-shop—I searched and found a bag of rice three bags of raw coffee one bag of gutta-percha a bag of chestnuts some bags containing samples of sugar a bag of nux-vomica a bag of calculus indices some spices and various samples in bottles they have been given up to him a small paper parcel of arrowroot seventy cigars and other articles I have not got a list of them—they were all in the shop under the counter except the cigars and they were in a cupboard in the bedroom—the gutta-percha was standing in front going into the shop—I found no more indigo Cross-examined Q You took all these things into your possession A I did I have returned every one of them to the prisoner s friends—I kept them for about a fortnight MR BALLANTINE Q I suppose you made inquiry about them A Yes I found out that a great many of them had been purchased and I found bills of them on the files—I found no bill of the indigo GEORGE APPEL re-examined Nothing was done with these pieces of indigo when they were taken out of the bag except marking them and putting them into the bag—I know what sample-dust is it is not a perquisite of the errand-boy s that I know—the indigo produced is not sample-dust MR HUDDLESTON submitted that upon this evidence the prisoner could not be found guilty even supposing credit was given to the boy s statement that to substantiate a charge of receiving there must first be evidence of a larceny and if as in this case after the original taking the goods came again into the possession of the master a subsequent accepting them even with a guilty knowledge would not amount to the offence charged the same point arose in Reg v Lyons 1 Car and Mar 217 which was however decided adversely to the prisoner The COURT did not think there was anything in the objection Mr Samuel Gregory solicitor Lord Mayor s Court-office and 25 Theberton-street Islington and Lewis Cowan of 65 Great Prescott-street deposed to the prisoner s good character MR BALLANTINE proposed in reply to the evidence to character to call a witness for the purpose of proving an invitation by the prisoner to the witness to rob his employer MR HUDDLESTON contended that this could not be done except where a previous conviction was charged MR BALLANTINE put it on this ground that as witnesses to character were called with a view to show that the party charged was unlikely to commit the particular act it was competent to him to rebut that character by tuck evidence as he proposed to adduce The COURT was of opinion that the evidence could not be received MR BALLANTINE further proposed to call a witness and to ask him whether he had ever heard anything against the prisoner referring as an authority for this to Reg v Stannard 7 Car and Payne The RECORDER did not think such a question could be put it would be perfectly admissible to prove that he bore a bad character in his own neighbourhood but as the Court had not permitted proof of another offence to be given mere hearsay to that effect was clearly not evidence he thought it was competent to give counter evidence of general reputation and such evidence he would receive reserving the point if necessary MR BALLANTINE rather than incur any delay did not press the matter farther GUILTY Aged 56 — Transported or Ten Years

Southampton—they arrived safely at Nine Elms—I put the way-bills into Mr Treacher s office—Kendall was the night-watchman when the train came in PETER KENDALL I was night-watchman at the Nine Elms station on 21st Feb I remember the train that arrived at 10 minutes to two o clock with Poulter as guard—I should say all the wagons attached to that train were taken away within the hour—a man named

Winchester gaol where I am under a sentence of transportation I know a person named William Winter—in Feb last he was a porter at the Nine Elms station—I also knew a man named Whicher—he was a greengrocer and coal-merchant—I know the prisoner Senior—I have known him about six years—I recollect Saturday 22nd Feb last—Winter and Whicher came to my house at or about 1 o clock that day—they made some inquiry—a box afterwards come to my place—my wife took it in between 6 and 7 in the evening—it was inclosed in a piece of coarse sheeting and directed to Mr Noone 22 Earl-street Finsbury to be left till called for —I assisted to open the box—there was a direction on the box it was not on a card but on the wood of the box itself—that box was taken away from my house by a man named Vincent a carman—Whicher sent him for it WILLIAM VINCENT I was sent for a box to Plampin s house—I broke it up and burnt it for firewood WILLIAM PLAMPIN continued The direction on the box was C C and Co —I assisted to open it—Whicher was present—I found it was filled with Paris-de-laines and two pieces of black merino—there were tickets upon them like these looking at some of this shape and description—Winter afterwards came and he and Whicher took the pieces out and they were packed upon the top of a small chest of drawers at my house—an arrangement was come to between us as to their disposal—after that arrangement I saw a person of the name of Wolfe Abrahams—they commonly called him Woolley Abrahams—I afterwards went down to the Mitre and there saw Abrahams and Myers—after leaving the Mitre Whicher told me to go somewhere in consequence of which I went to Senior s house—he kept the Black Dog public-house Sun-street Bishopsgate at the corner of Longalley—I found him at the end of the bar by himself—I asked him if he knew any one that would buy any pieces of de-laine—he asked me to bring some patterns down—I took some down on the Sunday evening—I first saw him about 3 o clock on the Sunday and in the evening I took him the patterns and showed them to him—I went home and cut the patterns off—after looking at them he said they were splendid goods he should not buy them himself but he could recommend me to a man—I then left and left the patterns with him—I went again on the Monday morning—I saw Senior and he said he would take me down to a man—he said he could not go then as his wife was ill but told me to call the next day—I called next day and from day to day down to Friday—I saw him every day—he said he could not go this day and he could not go the other day that his wife was not sufficiently recovered—on the Friday he sent for me—I was at home when the person came—my wife answered the door—I did not see the person that came—in consequence of a message I received I went to his house—I went into the bar-parlour and found Sayward and Senior there—they were examining the patterns which I had taken—Sayward asked me what I wanted for them— that was in Senior s presence —I said A shilling a yard —Sayward said he could not give a shilling he would write on a piece of paper what he would give and he wrote 8d —Senior said he could afford to give 1s for them—Sayward doubted whether they were all wool but after examination with him and Senior they considered they were all wool—the patterns contained both the de-laine and the merino—the price ultimately agreed upon was 8d for the de-laine and 9d for the two pieces of black merino—the price was reckoned up—Senior got a little book I think they call it a ready-reckoner—Sayward was casting up how much it would come to each piece—Senior said What do you make them come to I make them come to 1l 17s 4d a piece at 8d —they cast up the whole lot so that they came to 56l 9s 4d I believe—at that time only the patterns were there—Sayward said he should like to see a whole piece or two and asked me if I could not go and fetch them and I went and got two pieces and brought them back to Senior s—Senior was still there—Sayward examined them and laid them out at full length as they were folded and asked Senior for a yard measure—Senior got a yard-measure and Sayward measured them—he did not unfold them—he measured them as they laid and counted the folds—they were in folds of about a yard and a quarter—Sayward took the two pieces away—Senior gave him two sheets of paper to put them in—there was no other person present on that occasion—Senior s son George was in the bar attending to the customers—I think he is about twenty years of age—after Sayward left I told Senior that I was to make him some recompense for his trouble in recommending a customer—he said he did not want any money—he said D—n the money give me a piece or two of the stuff —he gave me two patterns of what he chose and I took the pieces to him myself the first Sunday in March—I delivered them in his presence laid them on the bar-table in the bar-parlour—there was no one else present—a man named Sayers saw me come out— there were twenty-eight yards in each of the pieces I took to Senior —Sayers said to Senior You have been up to some of your old games again Master George —it was spoken in a jocular sort of way in fact I do not know whether the man ever recollected such a circumstance—those were the words made use of—the goods were ultimately taken to Sayward s but before I left Senior s on that occasion Senior upbraided me because I let the goods go so cheap—he said I was a d—d bad salesman and it was a pity I should have such things to deal with—I went to Senior s again on the following Friday after I had left the goods for a part of the payment—Sayward and Senior were present—we were outside the bar on that occasion—I believe no one was present—10l was paid to me—I had previously received 20l in Senior s bar-parlour on the Friday night when the goods were sold—that was in Senior s presence—a sort of receipt was given for the money in Senior s presence—he supplied the piece of paper—he might have seen what was written on it—this is it produced —I should rather say all this was not written at that time—the Sixty was not on it when I put the signature to it—I put the signature in Senior s bar-parlour in his presence—I believe nothing was said in his presence as to the nature of it or what it was for—I then left—when the second instalment 10l was paid on the Friday after the first Friday in March Senior asked me if Sayward had paid me—I said no he had not he had paid me 10l and he said he was fiddling of me—he said Don t you know what I mean —I said Not exactly —he said Sayward was afraid that some one would halloo about it—he said whenever he Senior sold him anything he always gave him a regular bill Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q You were examined I think on the trial of Mr Sayward with a man named Whicher A Yes I then stated how this money had been disposed of—it was disposed of between me Whicher and Winter the whole of it—I had part of the six pieces—there were thirty-four pieces of Paris-de-laine—I had three lengths of fourteen yards each—I had no whole piece—Whicher had the majority of the six pieces—there were four taken down to his house in fact the whole six pieces were taken to his house on the first occasion—I cannot say whether Whicher had four of the pieces or not—I brought the contents of one piece from Whicher s together with three lengths for myself and that which Senior had was one piece in two halves—the rest was left at Whicher s house—how many that was I cannot say—Winter was to have had some but I believe he sold his to Whicher from what I understood—Senior had two half pieces—I was sentenced to ten years transportation for the gold-dust robbery—I am under that sentence now—I do not know what the Secretary of State has done for me—I know of nothing yet—if my sentence has been commuted it is more than I know—it has not been communicated to me—I am not expecting a commutation that I know of—I cannot say that I have any expectation of anything of the sort—all I can say is when I left the prison I found the ticket over my door 10 years transportation the same and I have heard nothing to the contrary since I have been here—I cannot say that I shall get anything by giving evidence I do not expect to—I had a very uneasy mind and I was very glad to get these things off my mind—I was uneasy after my conviction and so I was before—I would have got off if I could decidedly—I pleaded not guilty—I was innocent of the charge of which I was found guilty and I should not have been in my present situation if it had not been for Mr Senior for he has drawn me and many others into many a scrape of this description MR BALLANTINE Q Have you sent a petition to the Secretary of State A I sent one—I have not received any answer to it or any communication upon it—I do not know what the result of it is—the six pieces that were taken to Whicher s were independent of the pieces that were sold to Sayward—they were taken to Whicher s after I had the negotiation with Sayward—the goods were removed from my house to Vincent s and when they were removed from Vincent s they were taken round to Whicher s—the charge against me at Winchester was receiving a certain portion of gold-dust MARY PLAMPIN I am the wife of last witness—I know Whicher and Winter—I remember a parcel coming to my husband s house on Saturday 22nd Feb —it was brought by the witness Garrod—I paid him 1s 8d and 2d I gave him for himself—I signed the delivery-bill in the name of Noone—this is it looking at it —the box was afterwards unpacked—it contained mouseline-de-laines and merinos—they were put on the drawers in the bed-room and afterwards packed up in a box and a wrapper and taken away—on the Friday morning after the goods had come I remember young George Senior calling between 10 and 11 o clock—he said something to me—I told my husband what he had said and he went out to go to Senior s Cross-examined Q Have you ever been threatened with prosecution A No I am quite sure of that—I had a dress of this stuff JOHN SAYWARD a prisoner I formerly carried on business as a linen-draper in Hereford-place Commercial-road East—I was convicted here at the last Sessions of receiving these stolen goods—I come from prison to give my evidence to-day—I know the prisoner—I have known him ten or twelve years—I remember going to his house in Feb last—I went there of my own accord—I was passing that way—I saw Senior there—I had some ale I think at the bar—he asked me to walk into the bar-parlour—I do not know exactly what day this was but I think it was on the Tuesday previous to 28th Feb —I think there were some patterns of de laine lying on the table when I went in—I asked him what they were—he said a party had got them to sell—I would rather decline answering whether I had had previous transactions with Senior—he did not say the name of the party who had them to sell—he sent for Plampin who came—I am not quite certain who he sent but I believe it was his son—I had never seen Plampin before—he was introduced to me by Senior as the person who had got the goods to sell—I then had the patterns before me and was examining them—I asked Plampin the price—he said a shilling a yard—I am not certain whether Senior was in the room just at that particular moment or not—he was in and out of the bar during the time we were there—I objected to the price—I did not mention any amount at that first meeting as to the price of the goods but I asked to take the patterns with me—I went away and took them with me to consult my brother—I went again to Senior s house on a Friday—I am not certain whether Plampin was then in the bar or not—I went into the parlour—I do not think he sent out for Plampin then I rather think he was in the bar but I cannot say—I saw him and offered to give 8d a yard for them all round—that sum was not accepted—I bought the lot for 57l nett—I offered to give 1d a yard more on the black as he objected at first to 8d a yard—I made a calculation to ascertain the amount it came to and Senior did so also—I do not know how he made the calculation—he had a book in his hand—I believe it was a ready-reckoner —I have not had the slightest conversation with Plampin with reference to this matter either before or since his conviction—I believe 57l was the exact amount that was paid for the goods—on the second occasion I saw two whole pieces of the goods—Plampin went away and fetched them—I believe I counted the folds of those two pieces—I took them away with me—they were not folded in yards—they were more than a yard long—I did not have a yard-measure—I counted the folds and guessed the lengths of them—I wrapped them up in a sheet of paper and took them away—the paper was there at Senior s—I do not know whether they were brought there in a piece of paper or not—I did not pay any portion of the money on that occasion—I paid I believe 20l on the same evening—I made an invoice of the goods on a piece of paper—this produced is it—I believe the invoice was made out on my desk in my shop—this is the invoice that Plampin signed in my shop on the payment of the 20l —I paid it in my shop and he signed it there—the bulk of the goods had then been delivered—they were delivered on the Friday evening after I had been to Senior s—I have not the least doubt but the invoice was written and the money paid on my counter—the goods were brought by Plampin in the cart of a man named Vincent—I saw Senior again the next time I went there—I do not know how long after it was but it was a very short time—I should not think it was more than a week or it might have been ten days—I do not know that there was anything said then with Senior—I was twice there and made two payments there—I do not recollect that Senior said anything about the goods on those occasions—the first and last amounts I believe were paid in my shop and the two amounts between were paid at Senior s to Plampin—I cannot say whether Senior was present—I do not know whether one was paid in the parlour or not or whether both were paid in the shop but I know one was paid to Plampin in the shop whether the other was I will not undertake to say—they were small amounts I cannot recollect what—20l was paid on the first occasion at my shop—8l 10s was the last amount when I wrote settled on the bill—that was paid at my shop—I did not give Senior any portion of the mouseline-de-laine then—on a subsequent occasion I believe after the affair was settled I made him a present of two dresses of either ten or eleven yards each—he said something about the goods—I think he asked how I liked them and I said they turned out better than I expected and he asked me to make him a present of a dress and I gave him two dresses—at the price I bought them that would be about 15s —I sold them at 1s 21/2 d a yard in my shop—that was a good profit—we must have profit sometimes we have plenty of loss—I sold the black at 4s 11d which I had bought at 9d but I paid double for them for they were only half the length they should have been Cross-examined Q Has a request been made to you by the prosecutors to give evidence in this trial A I have been brought here for that purpose this morning—I saw Mr Crombie who said I should be required to give evidence—they have not held out to me the hope of any mitigation of my punishment and I should not have believed them if they had—my sentence is twelve months imprisonment—they have not threatened me with any other proceedings—I have not heard of anything of that kind from any one—my sentence was for receiving these very goods—I kept a shop at that time in the Commercial-road—it was a large shop—I had three houses—I had carried on business there about fourteen years HENRY SAYERS I am a cabinet-maker and live at 27 Long Alley I have known the prisoner about four years since he kept the house close to me—I once did a little job for him—his Christian name is George—I have been in the habit of calling him by that name—I have seen Plampin—I have seen him at Senior s—I cannot say when I last saw him there—it was just before he was taken on the gold-dust charge—Senior has frequently been present when I have seen Plampin there—I frequently saw Plampin there just before he was taken into custody on the gold-dust charge—I cannot say whether I made any remark to Senior in Plampin s presence at any time we were always laughing and joking together—we were in the habit of going there very frequently in fact Plampin worked for me at times made some clothes for me—I do not recollect on one of those occasions saying anything to Senior—I may have said something about old games but I was so many times there and we were always laughing and joking about different things that I cannot say anything that it refers to—I cannot recollect what I said about old games —I was intimate with Senior as a neighbour—I have not seen him at all since the last Session till this week—I have no doubt I said to him What George are you at your old games in the way of joking—I have no recollection of any particular occasion when I said so it is a sort of thing I might frequently have said and meant no harm by it either—it might have been about drinking a glass or anything of that kind—I was in the habit of using his house five or six times a day Cross-examined Q How long have you known him keeping this public-house A I should think about four years—it is a gin-shop—it is frequented by tradesmen who reside in the neighbourhood WILLIAM VINCENT re-examined I know Plampin—in Feb last I removed a box from his house to mine and afterwards took it to Mr Sayward s—I don t know what was in it Cross-examined Q Plampin was with you was he A Yes and Whicher JAMES BRANNAN police-inspector G I apprehended Whicher—I afterwards went with inspector Field to Senior s on Monday evening 28th July for the purpose of making inquiry as to what he knew—we were admitted by his son into the bar-parlour—Field told him he was an inspector of the detective police first telling him his name and asked whether he knew a person named Whicher he said he did for many years—I then asked whether he knew he was in custody he said he had heard so since he had been home that he had just returned from the country—Field then asked him if he knew a person of the name of Plampin he said Yes —he then asked him whether he knew a man named Say ward he said he did he occasionally dropped—in there to have a glass of ale or 3d -worth of brandy—he then asked him whether he recollected any business transaction between Plampin and Say ward referring to some merinos he said no he did not—Field said If Say ward were to say you did would he be telling the truth Senior said No and if he were to say so in my presence I would blow the b—s brains out —I asked him if he had any samples of the merinos he said no he had something to do besides watching his customers Cross-examined Q I believe you have never had an opportunity of mentioning this conversation before A No CHARLES WILSON I am manager to Messrs Candy and Co of 4 and 5 Watling-street consignees of the mousline-de-laine and merinos I saw the mousline-de-laine and merinos before the Magistrate they were from the manufactory of Messrs Paturle and Co —the wholesale price of the mousseline-de-laine is 1s 51/2 d and of the black merino 10s 6d —it is of the finest quality EMILE DE LEAL re-examined I saw these goods here on the last trial—they were the articles I sent LEWIS CROMBER I am managing-clerk to Messrs Bircham and Dalrymple I attended at the police-court on the charge against Whicher and Sayward—the prisoner was examined as a witness—this is the deposition he signed—I saw him sign it Cross-examined Q Did you hear it read over before he signed it A Yes read— George Senior on oath says —I kept the Black Dog in Crown-street Finshury I am a licensed-victualler—I live now at 48 Brunswick-street Hackney-road—I know Mr Sayward the prisoner these ten or twelve years—I know William Plampin who used to live in Earl-street—I have known him nine years when he belonged to a Lodge of Industry of Old Friends at my previous house—I know the prisoner Whicher since I have been in town—I knew him when he was employed at Mr Wood s—I cannot recollect as to Plampin and Sayward coming on any particular day to my house as I take 8l or 9l in pennies and twopences it would be impossible to say any particular persons were in my house on any day—I do not recollect introducing Plampin to Sayward—I do not recollect any sample of merinos and mousseline-de-laines being left with me—I never saw any to my knowledge—I did not have a piece of merino—I was not present when Sayward and Plampin met at my house to my knowledge—I did not send my son George to Mr Plampin s about Feb last to come to my house to see Mr Sayward not to my knowledge—I never sent him to my knowledge for the purpose—I should go myself if necessary and I never went myself —I believe Plampin had not been examined at the time Senior was examined—I think he was examined on a subsequent occasion—Senior was not subpoenaed—I will not be certain whether he attended the first day without a summons or not but in consequence of what took place it was necessary to summon him afterwards—he was not brought there in custody the first day—he might have stayed away if he had pleased—he was under no compulsion to attend—he surrendered to take his trial Mr Parry submitted that there was no case for the Jury upon either Count the only evidence of a receiving was upon Plampin s evidence Mr Justics Maule thought there was evidence for the Jury though he had great difficulty in seeing any material confirmation of the accomplices Charles Gordon distiller Goswell-street and William Fern clerk to Truman Hanbury and Co deposed to the prisoner s good character GUILTY Aged 48 — Transported for Seven Years Inspector Brannan stated that the prisoner s house was frequented by bad characters that he had been employed to watch the prisoner s conduct for some years though he had not been able

t18541127-72  72 ISAAC HART feloniously receiving on 10th Sept 23 forks 49 spoons 1 tankard and other articles value 240l the property of Sir Hyde Parker Bart and 1 salver 4 pairs of sugar tongs 2 sugar ladles 4 salt cellars and 1 knife the property of George Morton Eden well knowing the same to have been stolen MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution LOUISA ANN EDEN I am the wife of General Eden Last summer we were occupying the house of my uncle Sir Hyde Parker in Onslow-square—we had a butler named Baker—we left London on 12th Aug but hearing of this robbery on the 19th returned and found that all our own plate and Sir Hyde Parker s which had been left in the house was gone and Baker the butler had absconded—the value of the plate was between 600l and 700l some of it was old family plate there were silver dishes and a tankard silver gilt studded with coins with a figure on the top which had been a present from Queen Anne JANE HYAMS I was lady s maid to Mrs Eden Baker who has been tried here was the butler See Vol XL page 1374 he left the service on 13th Sept he went out and said that perhaps he should not return that night and I never saw him afterwards—in consequence of some communication made to me I sent for a builder and had the great closet broken open—we then found that all the plate was gone—Baker used to have the key of it—about ten days before he left he went to the same plate chest and showed me the top tray it appeared to be all right then THOMAS CROSSLEY I am nineteen years old and am the son of Robert Crossley who was tried here last Sessions and who is now in prison he kept a beer shop in Bermondsey—I resided with him there and assisted him in his business—I know Baker who was butler to General Eden—I first saw the prisoner to notice him on Saturday 9th Sept about 10 o clock in the morning at my father s shop—on that day by my father s direction I went to General Eden s house—I got there about half past 7 o clock in the morning and received from Baker a rush basket with a flat bottom which contained plate—I took it to my father s house and gave it to him when I got in and he took it up stairs and put it in the front bed room—in about half an hour the prisoner came my father went up stairs with him and I followed—they weighed the plate and while they were doing so the prisoner took out a tankard it was an old fashioned one with a bust of Queen Anne at the top and about thirty coins let in—my father said he thought it was gold the prisoner said No it is silver I know because I have such things passing through my hands every day and he asked me if I had got a file—I said I had got one down stairs he desired me to fetch it—he tried the tankard with the file and I believe it turned out to be silver—it was gilt—that as well as the rest of the plate was weighed there was some spoons and forks and a fish ladle of old fashioned make—the prisoner and my father together weighed it in what had been a potatoe machine which was kept up stairs it weighed about twenty pounds—they were iron weights potatoe weights—after it was weighed the prisoner put it into the basket again from which it had been taken—I saw 40l or 50l in gold paid to my father by the prisoner out of a little canvass bag such as this produced just the same colour—I cannot swear to it as it had a string like this red tape —after the money had been paid the prisoner asked me to carry the basket out for him to a cab—he said Take this I am going to take this along with me and I will pay you for your trouble —he left the house first and I followed him to Weston-street and found a cab waiting under the arch of the railway there he took the plate of me got into the cab and drove off—I saw him again between 4 and 5 o clock on that afternoon he brought back the same basket but without the plate—on the following morning about the same time I went to Onslow-square again I got up that morning at 6 o clock I think my father and mother and my little brother slept in the same room with me that Saturday night and my brother Robert slept in the same bed as me —when I got to Onslow-square I saw Baker again—I had taken the basket in the afternoon previous Saturday and left it there and on the Monday morning I received it again from Baker filled—I took it to my father s house it contained plate the same as before but new fashioned—my father took it up stairs—I gave it to him directly I got inside the door—about 1 o clock the prisoner came and they went up stairs together—I was up stairs cleaning myself in the room where the weighing machine was and where the family slept—I saw the prisoner empty the basket and weigh the plate—there was a plain silver teapot four large silver dishes four smaller ones and some silver spoons which the prisoner admired—he said that they were very massive table spoons—he put about half a dozen of them in a paper folded them up and put them in his pocket after they were weighed—the plate was then put into the basket by the prisoner and I believe there was about the same quantity of money passed as the day before it was all in gold and was taken out of the same bag—the prisoner employed me to carry it as before and I followed him to St Thomas s-street East on the other side of the river where there was a cab waiting at the bar which stops carriages from going down it was not a cab stand—the prisoner took the plate of me got into the cab and drove away—he did not give me any money he gave me a glass of gin—on Wednesday the 13th Baker came to my father s house and remained there till the 25th when he was taken into custody and my father also—after my father was taken I accompanied sergeant Whicher to Petticoat-lane and found the prisoner there he had just come out of a house there a public house I believe—I then said something to Whicher and he took him into custody Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Do you do anything for a living A Yes but not at present—I have been a servant but the last three or four years I have assisted my father in the beer shop business and the green grocery business that is why we had the scales—I lived with my father and did not want any payment—I had money when I wanted it—I was not a partner I was the same as a servant—I did not have any of the money for the plate I saw it pass but did not have a farthing of it that is perfectly true—I might have thought that this was wrong—I knew what was in the basket but I made a mistake at the police court—I was sworn to speak the truth when I made that mistake—I did know what I was carrying but instead of saying Yes I said No —I knew that Baker was robbing Mrs Eden and that my father was receiving it—I have not done anything of that kind before—I never carried any plate from any fashionable neighbourhood to Bermondsey before the 9th—it was after my father s conviction that I first unburthened my mind about this matter—I went to see him in gaol after he was convicted and he told me to tell all I knew—I never thought anything about getting any mitigation of his sentence by doing this nor do I now—my father made a confession and I forwarded his ends that was after he was convicted—he was in trouble about six years before when he was living up at the other end of the town—he changed a 10l note for a man who had committed a burglary he was taken down to Warwick and discharged—I had nothing to do with it I was away from home at the time—it was not on the day that I saw my father in gaol that I made this communication to Whicher but it was after I had seen him—I did not say that I recognised the portrait of a Queen on the tankard I said I recognised the name of a Queen upon it and a portrait of a woman—I never heard that it was Queen Anne before to-day—I was present at my father s trial—I did not hear the evidence I was not there half the time ROBERT CROSSELY I am seventeen years old and am the brother of the last witness In September last I was errand boy at Mr Osmond s a dyer of Ivy-lane Newgate-street—I was there seven months and left last Saturday—I slept at my father s house in the same bed with my brother the last witness—I first saw the prisoner on Thursday 8th Sept it was at my father s house—he was having some conversation with my father about 11 o clock in the morning—I did not hear anything pass between them—he stopped about a quarter of an hour and when he left I followed him by my father s orders—the first house he went to was a little jeweller s in Harrow-alley that runs out of Petticoat-lane—I waited about five minutes and he came out of there and went to a public house in Petticoat-lane kept by Jacobs—I do not know the sign of it—he was there about half an hour and I then followed him to a coffee shop in Petticoat-lane he was there about twenty minutes and I then followed him to a tobacconist s near Whitechapel-road he was there two or three minutes and he then went back to Jacob s where I left him and returned to my father s house and told him what I had seen—I saw the prisoner again on Sunday—my brother got up that morning about half-past 6 or 7 o clock and went out he came home again about 10 o clock with a large rush basket I did not see what it contained it appeared to be full and heavy—it was taken up stairs by my brother into the bed room on the first floor where me and my brother and my father and mother slept—our house is closed on Sunday mornings but it opens at 1 o clock—I was in the bar when the house opened and the prisoner came in directly the door was opened my father was there and he and the prisoner went up stairs into the bed room—my brother was up stairs I believe I know he was not down stairs—my father and the prisoner were up in the bed room twenty minutes or half an hour—I was there when they came down and the prisoner said to my father that if he had had the weights and scales of the trade he should have made a better bargain—I saw the prisoner leave he took something with him but my brother followed him out with the rush basket which I saw him with in the morning it appeared to be full—I did not see the prisoner after this—he called there the next day after my father was taken into custody and asked where my father was my brother told him he was out—he said Tell him I shall call and see him in a few days I am going to Birmingham —I afterwards went with my brother and Sergeant Whicher to Petticoat-lane Cross-examined Q Have you often been to Petticoat-lane A Not very often I have been about that way often and know where it is very well—I have never been there on any little matter of business—I never sold any old coats there or anything else—I can read and write a little—I always sleep with my brother—I left my situation on Saturday it was through this case—I gave notice myself to leave on Saturday week—I did so because I had been away ill before that and I did not like to ask them to spare me again—I knew nothing at all about the plate—I came home every night and slept with my brother when he got up at half-past 6 o clock in the morning he did not tell me where he was going but when he was going out I asked to go with him—we have talked this matter over and over again—I know Baker he is the man that was conversing with my father—before my father was apprehended I knew that Baker was in the house—I did not know that he was concealed or that there were orders from my father and mother that nobody was to know he was there—my mother was living with my father at the time of this transaction—I have also a brother ten years old—I took my meals at home—Baker did not take his meals with us the meals were taken to him in his room up stairs at the top of the house—the room was not locked—I have taken his meals up Q Why did not you ask him to come down and dine with you A It was a room that he had hired—I had not the curiosity to ask why he had hired it or why he was there—I never denied him to any one I was never asked about him—I remember the policeman apprehending him—the prisoner called after my father was apprehended—I knew all about it then but did not before I knew nothing about the plate or money—my father has not given me a sovereign or half a sovereign—it was on Sept 8th that my father sent me to follow the prisoner he had told me to get a half holiday the night before to do it MR BODKIN Q I believe that Baker and your father were old acquaintances A Yes they had been in the same regiment together JONATHAN WHICHER I am a detective officer On 5th Nov I took the prisoner in Petticoat-lane—the two Crossleys were with me—I told him I was a police officer and apprehended him on suspicion of receiving a large quantity of plate—he said he knew nothing about it—I found the bag produced on him and seven sovereigns Cross-examined Q Did you go to his lodging A Yes in Horse-shoe-alley Petticoat-lane he occupied two rooms he has a wife and a large family—there was rather the appearance of poverty than otherwise—I saw two lads there and three or four young girls who I understood were his daughters—I should think the two rooms would let at 5s or 6s a week at least—it was not a lodging but a house there was one room down stairs and one up—I did not go to Harrow-alley or to any small jeweller s shop—the prisoner was standing outside Jacob s house when I apprehended him LOUISA ANN EDEN re-examined Among the plate lost was a plain silver teapot of Sir Hyde Parker s and a chased one—there were eight or ten silver dishes—our plate was modern—there were a great many table spoons of the Queen s pattern handsome ones—there was a portrait on the tankard but I rather think it was of Queen Mary and not Queen Anne it was inlaid with coins and was silver gilt—the dish covers were Sir Hyde Parker s and there were four large old butter boats—the old plate was Sir Hyde s and the modern our s—the butter boats were such that you could put a ladle on each side—it was massive good plate COURT Q What was there to indicate that it was a portrait of a Queen was there a name on it A There was something to indicate that it was a Queen I would not be certain that there was a crown on the head—I am not certain whether there was an inscription of the name of any Queen John Benjamin a tailor of 34 Dudley street Soho Philip Raphael furniture broker and dealer in diamonds of No 1 Magdalen-road Joseph Myers boot and shoe maker of Duke-street Aldgate Samuel Silver confectioner of No 39 Middlesex-street Joseph Hyam fishmonger of No 107 Middlesex-street and Solomon Abraham biscuit baker of No 110 Houndsditch gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 55 Strongly recommended to mercy by the Jury on account of his character Transported for Fourteen Years There was another indictment against the prisoner Ninth Jury 
t18550702-702  702 JOSEPH GRAY feloniously receiving 9 watches 5 watch cases and other goods value 155l the goods of William Langford MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution EDWIN LANGFORD I am the son of William Langford—he lives at No 53 Broad-quay Bristol and is a chronometer and watch maker—I was living with him in Feb last—I was at home on the night of 21st Feb —the property a portion of which I have since seen was all safe that evening—in the course of that night the premises were broken open and in the morning we missed property to the amount of from 2 700/ to 3 000l—it consisted of 120 gold watches 100 silver watches and 100 or more gold chains and seven gold job watches—my father offered a reward of 200 —we did not succeed in obtaining any information between that time and 21st April—about that time I came to London and went to the house of Henry Webster a watch maker No 7 Albert-terrace Camden-town—in consequence of an application of mine to him he showed me some watches and amongst them was one that I knew—after some conversation with him I agreed to purchase that watch—I got it into my possession I paid 9l 10s for it—this is it—it is one that was stolen from my father s house on the night of 21st Feb —in this part where the maker s name is usually placed the name has been taken out and a new number put on it—there is no name on it now—the plate has been reduced—the name on it was William Langford Broad-quay Bristol —I did not see any other of the watches we had lost at Mr Webster s then—having purchased this watch I came away—I went again on the following Tuesday the 24th I went alone—I did not find any more of my father s property on that second occasion—I went again on the following day and by my instruction Jackson and Mason followed me in and searched the house and in a little nest of drawers on Mr Webster s work board I found two gold cases and two movements belonging to the cases—these are them—I have put them together since—the original names have been taken out and other names put on and the numbers have been altered by making 1 into 4 and 2 into 8 —that was all we found—Webster was taken into custody and taken to the police court—he was afterwards admitted to bail and then examined as a witness—on Thursday 26th April I went with Jackson to the house of a watchmaker named Bartman No 50 Compton-street Clerkenwell—I there found five gold cases and four parts of movements—I am able to identify them as a portion of the property my father losfc—Bartman gave an account of where he got them from—these are them—I have here got the watches and parts of watches that we found at Bartman s —all of them except one are deficient of the parte on which the names are usually put or at least where they were put on these cases—I am able to Bay that these watches have had my father s name on them William Langford Broad-quay —one of them was deficient of the pillar plates but they were found at Webster s—from what I learned I went the same night to the house of Gray—Bartman and Jackson went with me—Gray lives on Clerkenwell-green—he carries on the business of a jeweller s tool dealer—he has a shop—there seemed nothing but tools—Gray was at home—Jackson and I and Bartman went as far as the end of the churchyard iind left Bartman in custody of a constable—Bartman had the watches in tin boxes—Jackson and I went to the iron sate leading to the side door of the house and Mr Gray answered it—Mr Jackson said he wanted to speak to him—he opened the gate and I said I want to buy some crossing files —that was to get into the shop—he showed us into the shop and Jackson put the following questions to him Have you any watchest he said No — Have you had any lately he said Not for many months —I then gave him into the custody of Jackson—Jackson put the questiont to him again and told him he was an officer and he gave the same answers negatives to all the questions—Jackson then told me to open the front door—I opened it and called Bartman in and Jackson said Mr Bartman from whom did you have those watches you have in the box he said From Mr Gray —Gray said Oh I remember now I did give then to him —we then searched the house but found nothing else—he was then taken to the police court—all the property produced is a portion of what we lost—there are six watches from the north of England which have been altered—they were sold by Mr Webster HENRY JACKSON police-sergeant H 11 I accompanied Mr Langford in search of this property—on Wednesday evening 25th April I went to Mr Webster 8 in Albert-terrace Camden-road—I have seen the property that the last witness has identified—that is the property found there—I assisted in searching Mr Webster s premises and brought away the property identified by Mr Langford—on the evening of the 26th 1 went to the house in Compton-street occupied by Bartman—he produced this property to us and gave an account of it—in consequence of what was disclosed there I went the same evening to the house of the prisoner about 9 o clock—I went into the shop with Mr Langford and saw Mr Gray—I asked him if he had any watches altered or sent any to be repaired in any way—he said no he had not—I was in plain clothes but I disclosed to him that I was an officer—I said Be very careful Mr Gray I am an officer belonging to the police I will ask you again which I did and he said no he had not had any watches in his shop for four months—Mr Langford then undid the front door—the shop was shut at that time—I called Mr Bartman in—he came and brought in this tin box—I asked Mr Bartman of whom he had those watches—he pointed to Mr Gray and said I had them of Mr Gray —I then told him he must consider himself in my custody—I asked him if he had any bills or invoices of either of them—he said no he had none—I asked him of whom he purchased these watches—he said I bought them one or two at a time over the counter I do not know who I bought them of—I took him to the station and he was afterwards taken before the Magistrate—he was bailed after the examination and after he got outside he gave a description of a man of whom he said he bought them—from the description he gave me I told him I knew the man very well—he had been in custody before—he could not recollect the name but he afterwards told me the name—I made arrangements to meet him at Spital-square station at 3 o clock in the afternoon—I met him and we went down to a public house in Cambridge-heath-road—he went inside with his friend Mr Symons a gentleman who bailed him and the sergeant and I remained outside at the corner of the house—he was in it might be three or four minutes when he came out and said There is one of the men just gone along he is the man that took the money for the watches —I said Why did not you follow him out and give him in charge directly as you had a very good opportunity —I had not an opportunity of seeing the man that he represented then but I did afterwards—Mr Gray said I think I know where he is gone to I think I can find him —I said We will follow behind you and will go into the public house the Gossett Anns in Gosseti-street and remain there and as sergeant Mason and I were going down Montague-street we saw three persons in close conversation Mr Symons and Mr Gray with a short man—we went about ten paces round the comer and I told Mason to stop there—in about a minute or two Mr Symons came round the corner and he said That is the man that is the man go and take him —I saw two men walking up the street about thirty yards off—one I have no doubt was Mr Gray—I told Mason to make haste up if that was the man he might get him—Mason ran up and just as we got within about sixty yards Gray said That is the man I have lost him COURT Q You saw two men and one was Gray A Yes—we followed them and lost sight of both of them because they went round a corner to the right—I saw Mr Gray again at the corner of the turning—he came back and said That was the man I have lost him —I said If that was the man why did not you give him in charge when we passed you so close just now MR CLARKSON Q Had you before passed the man that Gray pointed out A Yes passed close to his elbow—I said Why did not you give him in charge when we passed you just now —I said He can t have gone far he can t have run away —Mason said he must have seen him round the corner and he did not see him—Gray said he knew the house where the man lived and he pointed it out to us and we went and sat in the house till 4 o clock in the morning—we have not found him since—the name he mentioned was Day—the house is in Cambridge-heath-road—that was not the same person that I stated I knew—Gray and his friend then went home Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q They remained as long as you did A I think they did they might go a very few minutes before—Qray had been bailed—I cannot recollect whether he went before Symons or no t—he said afterwards that it was my fault that this man escaped—he said Why did you not take him —I said How was I to know he was the man —I said it was his fault that I did not take him—he did not say that was a lie—he said he was so flurried at the time that he did not know what to do—I had arranged to meet Gray at the station in Spital square—when he got there I was not there—I was there a few minutes afterwards—I was there between 3 and 4 o clock—I do not think it was nearer 4 than 3 o clock—I was not in a public house playing billiards then—Mason and myself and Gray and Symons went to the Gossett Arms—I think we had a game at bagatelle—it was too early to go down to this place—it might have been 7 or 8 o clock I cannot recollect exactly the time—I suppose we might have been there half an hour—it was between 7 and 8 o clock in the evening COURT Q Was it before you saw Gray and Symons and the third man standing in the street A Yes MR BALLANTNE Q But did not Gray come and find you at the public house A Yes—the arrangement was that he should come to us Q When he got to the house where you were playing bagatelle did he not want you to come with him at once and did you not tell him to wait till you had finished your game A It might have been said so if the game was not quite finished—I do not say that I did not say so—those words might pass—I will not Bay one way or the other—I might have said so—I think we had two games—we were waiting for them coming back JAMES MASON police sergeant S 25 I was with the last witness on the occasion when we went to Webster s—I did not go to Gray s house—I went with Gray and the last witness and Symons to Bethnal-green on Friday 27th April—we met at the Spital-square station about 3 o clock in the afternoon—we went to a public house where sergeant Jackson and Gray agreed we should meet—we then went into the neighbourhood of Bethnal-green-road I think Cambridge Heath-road—we went to a public house——I think the man s name that kept it was Hunter—I think it was the Red Deer or Rein Deer—I am a perfect stranger in that neighbourhood—Gray left us and went into the house—it was arranged that if he saw the person there that sold him the watches he should come outside and speak to him under the lamp in front of the house—he went in the house and remained a few minutes—it was about 9 o clock at night or getting towards 9—we were waiting and watching for him and the man to come out—presently he came out to us—we were a short distance off—he said I saw the man in the house but he has disappeared his place is vacant and he has left his glass of what he was drinking standing on the table —we then remained some time and he was making inquiries with regard to a person named Day—that was the first time I had heard the name of Day—he said he kept a small tea shop or was a dealer in tea—I went with him and he made some inquiries with respect to finding this person named Day—he found the address of the man Day and after waiting some time it was agreed that Gray and Symons should go to another public house to look for Day—I think the public house was the sign of the Panther—I do not know the name of the street—he was to look for Day or the person he had first named to us—sergeant Jackson and I followed him and passed the public house and near the public house we saw three persons in conversation the prisoner and Symons and a third person unknown to us—I was very close to them in fact if I had put my hand out I could have touched them—we went about twelve paces beyond them and turned the corner of a street—after remaining there somewhere about a minute I should say Symons came round the corner and said That was one of the men —Jackson and I followed in the direction where Gray and the other person were going—they went in the opposite direction to that in which we had come—I then started and ran—I could see two persons walking perhaps sixty paces ahead of me and they were very near the corner of the street at that time—I ran to the corner and met Gray coming down the street—I turned the corner—they had disappeared from my view and I met Gray coming towards the corner—I said Where has the man gone to —he said He started off and ran he has gone ont at the end of the street he ran as hard as he could —I said Why did you not stop him or detain him —he said I could not do so he ran away before I was aware of it —I said If you had attempted to hare detained him I should have been at your elbow in an instant I could have caught him —he said He ran away quite unawares I had no idea he was going to run —at that time Jackson and Symons came up and the prisoner proposed to go to Day s house and wait for his return—we went there and waited till about 4 o clock in the morning—he never came in—at that time we left—we gave up the search and the inquiry—if when we passed them in the street I had been told to take him I could have taken him with a great deal of ease Cross-examined Q Were you not told by Gray that when three persona came out of the public house you were to take the third A No he did not mention a third person—he did not say that if a stranger came out of the public house with him and Symons I was to take him—he did not put it in that way—I saw him speak to Bay near the Panther—I did not see him come out of the Panther—I knew Gray was going to the Panther—he did not say before he went in the Panther that if we saw him and Symons with a third person we were to take the third person he never mentioned such a thing to me nor to Jackson—I saw a third person in company with Gray and Symons—I did not exactly expect that that third person would be the man because that person did not answer the description of the person—he described him as being a tall man and the third man as a short man something like Jackson—the other man was a tall man DeVaux—the prisoner was to meet us at the Spital Square station—three o clock was the time I think we were a little after—it was between 3 and 4 o clock and then he was to come to us at another public house—Jackson amused himself with a game at bagatelle I was sitting looking on—I believe the landlord played with him it was just to while away the time—I do not know whether Jackson staid to finish the game—I went out—Gray might say Come along at once and Jackson might say Stop till we finish the game but I went out MR CLARKSON Q Do you know the Gossett Arms That is the name of the house now you mention it HENRY WEBSTER I live in the City-road—I did live in Albert-terrace Camden-town—I have known the prisoner since Sept or Oct I cannot say to a week—I only came to town in Sept—I purchased some gold watches of him about 6th or 7th March—to the best of my belief I bought these nine gold watches looking at them of him—they were all bought at the same time and three more twelve altogether—here are six here that I sold in my journey in the north—I saw Mr Langford at my house on 21st April—I sold him a watch which is among the lot that is before me—this is it—it is one I bought of Gray—I afterwards received from him some name plates that would be some time afterwards—I would not say whether these are them looking at some or not—I did not take particular notice of them—they were given me by Mr Gray to gild but they were not in a state to gild they wanted smoothing up to gild—they had been filed and were rough—I do not know how many there were I never counted them—the name of the maker is placed sometimes in one part sometimes in another—this is the part that is rough in these plates it appears in both parts Q Are you able to say whether there appears to have been a filing out of anything A It evidently has that appearance—I had not looked at them when they were handed to me by the prisoner—they were wrapped in a brown paper parcel—those were the plates I received from Gray—I think I afterwards saw the prisoner before I was apprehended—I said the plates were not in a fit state for gilding and I should not do them Cross-examined Q Those six from the north hare You beard anything about them before A They were shown to me by Mr Langford and sergeant Jackson—I did not tell the officer when I was taken that there were ax watches I had disposed of in the north—they had got my books and papers and all—I cannot tell whether those six were produced before the Magistrate—I know I saw them here last Session—to all appearance there has been something erased in these plates—I did not do it myself—I did not erase anything—I did not buy these plates—I do not know whether there was anything erased on the watches I bought—they are just in the game state as I bought them in that respect with the exception of two or three that I sold and the parties wished to have their names on them—I am a large purchaser of watches—I very often see that the names have been erased—it is nothing uncommon to buy watches with the names erased—it is not unusual for me or others to buy such a quantity of watches—such quantities are bought at sales and of different dealers—I have often bought as many as these and a great many more than these—I have perhaps not bought quite so large a lot at a time—50l or 60l worth I have bought—I have bought at Jackson s and Debenham and Stan s—I have bought 50l or 60l worth at those places and there are places in the City where a lot of watches are sold—they are sold in numbers of places—they are sold by auction and sold openly—sometimes there is no name on them—sometimes another name is put on—that is what they call new christening a watch—they do that because they do not like some name and they have another name put on them—it is Tery frequently done in country watches they put on London makers names to give them greater value—I considered there was nothing suspicious in the transaction—I gave 90l for the twelve watches—the prisoner is a dealer in took—the first transaction I had with him I bought some tools of him—I have known him to deal in watches—I saw some watches hang in his window and asked to look at them MR CLARKSON Q The effect of altering the name would be to induce persons in the country to buy them A Many customers in the country like either to have a watch without a name or with a good name—either a good name or their own name GEORGE BABTMAN I live at No 5 Compton-street Clerkenwell and am a watch maker I know the prisoner I work for him occasionally—I received these parts of watches that have been produced by Mr Langford from him—they are not in the state that I had them—there were five gold cases and part of four movements which were given up to the prosecutor COURT Q In what respect were those movements deficient A Of the top plates and some of the wheels MR CLARKSON Q From whom did you have those You gave up A From Mr Gray—I was to put them together—I was waiting for the remainder of the ports to put them together—Mr Gray said he would bring me the remainder to put together—I can hardly tell when these were brought to me—he is in the habit of bringing me a great deal of work—I should say I had had them a fortnight or three weeks or it might be a month—he is in the habit of bringing some work and taking other work away John James William Symons of Gravesend Edward Parker a watch find chronometer hand maker of Seckforde-street William Whitelock a jeweller of Clerkenwell Thomas Cotton a watch and chronometer

t17471209-52  63 64 Peter Tickner and James Hodges commonly called and known by the name of Poison were indicted for unlawfully and feloniously assembling themselves together on the 22d of Dec in the eighteenth year of his Majesty s reign in Lidlight near Lid at the sea-coast for being armed with fire-arms and other offensive weapons in order to be assisting in running and carrying away several uncustomed goods that is to say a large quantity of tea then lately imported from parts beyond the sea upon which goods were duties due to his Majesty not paid to the great Diminution of his Majesty s revenues and against his crown and dignity Solicitor General Gentlemen of the Jury the two Prisoners at the Bar Peter Tickner and James Hodges otherwise Poison are now indicted for having been arm d and assembled together with other persons above the number of three arm d in order to aid and assist in the running uncustomed goods And they are indicted for the offence in transgression of a statute made the 9th year of his present Majesty s reign that if any persons to the number of three or more after the 17th of June 1736 shall be assembled arm d with arms fire-arms and other offensive weapons in order to be assisting in running landing and carrying away uncustomed goods and upon conviction of such an offence shall be judged guilty and shall be transported The Legislator has been forc d since to make that offence capital but the present charge against the prisoners is within the act of the 9th of his present Majesty which is transportation You need not be told because it is very notorious the different steps the government has been forc d to take in order if possible to get the better of the crying offence of smuggling they have try d all methods indemnit ies and punishments they have from step to step try d different degrees of punishment in the 9th of his present Majesty it was thought it would be sufficient to break the practice by making it felony by transportation You very well know that smuggling is carried on without paying duties to answer the expences of the public and it is not barely defrauding a little but tis carried on by a kind of rebellion in defiance of the Magistrate therefore they go arm d 30 or 40 and perhaps a 100 in a gang there is no magistrate or officer where they reign if I may so say can put any laws in execution against them Therefore the legislator found it necessary to come to another act and tis by vertue of that law it is now made capital that was an act made in the 19th of his present Majesty for tis now a struggle between the government and this banditti which shall get the better All offences against this act or any former acts of this kind may be try d in any county and it is on the former act it now comes before you The Prisoners before you are of a gang well known by the name of the Hawkhurst gang A great number associated together to carry on this lawless practice of theirs and they carry it on in an open public manner The two Prisoners at the bar are the two principal or perhaps ringleaders of the Hawkhurst gang the particular offence they are now charg d with was on the 22d of December 1744 It may be material to state to you that we have one that happens to have an opportunity to prove the fact so clearly upon them that they were armed themselves together with other persons and the witness will prove the species of goods they run and all the circumstances belonging to it and it may be material to observe to you that John Bolton one of a good character and reputation for 14 years in the government s service but his Integrity had like to have cost him dear he thinking the law would be sufficient to justify him in the exercise of his duty thought to check some of their practices in the county of Kent when he was returning back he put up at an Inn to refresh himself call d the King s-Head-Inn in Shoreham he happened to be there with two other officers and they were soon alarm d with a great noise and shouting and they found the Hawkhurst gang was come upon this they went to hide themselves when this gang came to the house in pursuit of these officers they swore they would have them or they would pull the house down and they found the witness Bolton and the other two persons Jones and Floyd they did not get back again but he did and is now able to do his country justice As soon as they found them they tied their hands behind them and tied their feet by the stirrup then to strike a terror to other people to shew how dangerous it was to oppose them they whipt them towards Tunbridge and when they came to Hawkhurst then they disciplin d them with their stirrup-leathers and when they had done this they carried them afterwards to New-Rumney they were afraid of their escaping so they carry d them and particularly Bolton the witness upon the 22d and the 24th of December to Lidlight in the parish of Lid in the county of Kent They took the prisoner with them and took out the goods before him and he was kept in their custody for a while but afterwards he providentially got away from them While he was there he saw the goods brought from on board the cutter The goods that are generally run for the ease of carriage and stowage are tea brandy or wine in small casks The tea when it comes from Flushing Boulogne or any of the opposite coasts they put on board the cutter all in oil-skin bags and these bags are tied together so that when they come to shore then they have nothing to do but throw them across the horses sometimes they ride upon them and sometimes they have drove horses No fair merchant ever imports tea in oil-skin bags tis well known by all the people in the country when they see oil-skin bags whose they are Neither can any brandy or wine be imported in any cask less than 60 gallons but they always import it in casks they call half-anchors and they fling them the same way Another witness saw the Prisoners on the 27th in another place in the county in the same gang with oil skin bags and brandy carrying it from the coast If you are satisfied with this evidence you will do the country justice and prevent a great many other people from entering into such associations Sol General to John Bolton Do you know the Prisoners Bolton Yes December the 18th 1744 I was sent down to a place called Kingsdown and returned back again in the forenoon when I came to Shoreham Q Who came with you there Bolton There was Peter Floyd and John Jones and one of our horses being lame we were obliged to have the horse shod while we were there in about an hour and a half all of a sudden we heard a prodigious firing and it was a gang of smuglers Q How many Bolton Eight of them They came up to the ale-house hearing of such a number coming we went and hid ourselves but they seeing our horses threatened they would have us or they would pull and fire the house down and upon searching they found us and robbed us of our arms and money and they tied us to the stirrups and had us down to Hawkhurst after they had us there some time they stripped us naked all above the waist and then they began to cut us in a very terrible manner They put horse-locks about our legs and kept us in chains On the 20th there was a vast number of horses collected together and then we were put upon horses again tied and carried to New-Rumney and eight or ten with us and Hodges was with us at New-Rumney and sat up with us two nights I am positive to Hodges he hit me three or four blows Q How long did you continue there Bolton We continued these to the 22d and word was brought that the Boulogne boat was come in then the horses were got out directly and we were put upon horses and tied Hodges went down with me in company with the horses to Lidlight when we came there I believe there were two hundred horses and one hundred men The great length of many extraordinary trials this Sessions makes it absolutely necessary to publish them in two numbers the

Bolton Each of them with a carbine and a pair of pistols Q Was Tickner at Lidlight Bolton Yes I was as near to him as I am to you Hodgers had a pair of pistols and a carbine to the best of my remembrance Hodger s was a brass carbine and Tickner s was an iron one and most of them were arm d some with a carbine and a pair of pistols some in bags and some on their backs Q When they came to Lidlight what did they do Bolton Some were standing about and some were landing of tea in oil-skin bags I believe to speak within compass there were five tun contained in oil-skin bags I saw their loaded horses and there was a waggon with four oxen and two horses and a cart with two oxen loaded with brandy and wine As to the brandy I drank some of it upon the Beach The prisoner Tickner after he had loaded the horses went away and left a great many people upon the Beach Q What reason had you to apprehend it was tea Bolton By all their discourse and it was in the same package as I always seiz d it and the brandy was in half anchors Q From what discourse did you conclude this to be tea and brandy Bolton By their discourse of its coming from Boulogne and they intended I should be sent over to Boulogne Q Did you see them aiding and assisting in carrying away these goods Bolton As for Tickner I saw him loading the horses as to the other I did not see him load but I saw him there armed with the rest I saw three or four boat loads come from the cutter Sol Gen How long have you been an officer in the customs Bolton Twelve years Q Are you acquainted with the package of tea and brandy Bolton There is a canvas within side of the oil-skin and the tea is within that and generally put up in quarter of hundred bags sometimes there will be two bags tied together then they tie knots and throw them across the horse they did it the same as I always saw it Cross examination Council How many times have you been an evidence against people concerned in this practice Bolton I believe twice Council Was you ever an evidence at Rochester and was you not an evidence the last Sessions Bolton I answered the question as to the manner of their smuggling tea Q Did not you know that Tickner was in custody in Maidstone Bolton I don t know whether I did or not Council Did not you know that he was to take his trial at Rochester assizes Bolton I heard he was in custody Council Surely you can recollect the time How came you not to remark the time when you first heard that Tickner was in custody can you tell whether it was two or three months ago when did you first give your information against Tickner Bolton I can t say Council When you first heard he was in Maidstone goal how came you not to prosecute how came you to recollect this 18th of December Bolton I can t but remember it Sol Gen Do you think any man whipped as he was could ever forget the day Council What habit had they Bolton They had both of them light coats Tickner loaded his horse near to me Council Can you pretend to say you knew what was in those bags can you tell that it was tea Bolton I believe it was they pegg d one of the casks of brandy and I casted it Council How do you know it had not paid duty Bolton I believe it had not they waited two or three days for the boats coming from Boulogne Council So it is upon your belief that these goods had not paid duty Bolton I saw it brought from the sloop and the brandy I drank of Council How came you to be in that country Sol Gen They carried him there and whipped him Bolton We were to have been put on board the vessel but the sailors belonging to the smuggling cutter would not take us on board the smugglers fired at the sailors and the sailors fired at them Serjeant Hayward I am sorry to hear that Council How long have you known Tickner Bolton I can t say that I ever knew him before I saw him upon the Beach Council How many times have you seen him since that Bolton While I was with them I saw him four or five times Sol General to Edward Anderson Do you know Tickner the Prisoner at the bar Anderson Yes Sir Q Where did you see him Anderson I saw him at a place called Waddon in the county of Surry about the 6th or 7th of September 1744 he was loaded with oil-skin bags and half anchors and five or six men and six or seven drove of horses loaded with oil-skin bags and half anchors Q How long have you lived in that county Anderson Many years I was bred and born thereabouts I never saw any tea belonging to smugglers but what was packed in oil-skin bags all that I ever seized was in oil-skin bags Cross examination Council How often have you seen Tickner before Anderson Several times before and since I have drank with him I was in his company at Waddon Council When had you the first information that he was taken up Anderson I saw him brought to town through the Borough Council How long ago did you give your information Anderson I gave information to his Majesty s Solicitor that such a person was guilty of such an offence I did it voluntarily Council Did not you hear he was taken up Anderson I went and told that I knew such a person Council Did not you know that he was a farmer Anderson I was not acquainted with his farming business he was always accounted a notorious smuggler Sol General to Foster Give an account in what manner tea and brandy are stowed Foster I have been an officer of the customs above thirty years and in the course of that time I have seized large quantities of run goods forty or fifty tons at different times from gangs of smugglers and I never met with any goods in oil-skin bags but tea and whenever I found these bags I was certain they were nothing else but tea and when I opened them they always proved to be tea Now as to brandy it is much the same as to package especially when it comes from the water-side they bring it in half anchors in order to carry them easily upon horses I don t know that I have found an half anchor but has had brandy as to the difference between tea that has paid the duty and what is run I apprehend is this no tea can be imported into England but must be brought to London no private person is permitted to bring it any where I never knew any tea imported but in casks or tubs nor do I know that liberty is given for any body to import but to London Q What do you take to be the reason of their stowing it after that manner Foster I apprehend the reason is that it might be portable they generally when they are loaden are tied with cords to be put more readily into sacks and when they are so tied a man may easily set upon the bags Cross examination Council Suppose a person had a mind could he not put lace in those bags Foster I don t say they might not but I never met with any such thing Sol General Five tons of lace for instance Foster If they were lace or silks it would appear in another shape you would see the rolls if silk was put into bags it would appear if there is tea in those bags it will appear as oats or other corn to fill it around Council Suppose a man had a mind to lay out five hundred pounds in linen and carry it in that manner Foster I think there is no doubt at all but when any man sees these bags he can tell he can tell whether it is piece goods or tea or coffee besides linens are never imported in oil-skin bags they are commonly in casks Cross examination Council They that purchase tea at the Custom-house have proper authority to put it into these bags have they not Foster Yes but I never knew it done for it hurts the tea and gives it something of a taste Court to Tickner What have you to say by way of defence Tickner I never saw Bolton but once and for curiosity I got off my horse and went and saw him I heard a great noise I was plowing in the field and went out of curiosity I went up to the hedge to see them go down it was on a Friday and the next day he swore to me I never saw the man before I never saw nor knew any thing of him I could prove that I loaded five bags of hops and sent them to London that morning Hodges I never saw the man the witness Both guilty of the felony whereof they stand indicted Transportation See summary

d d - n him knock him down knock him down that then he was set upon by several of them who beat him in a very violent manner knocked him down and tumbled their horses over him that then they forced him towards a ditch about a road wide and proposed to murder him and throw him in that then they forced him into the ditch that he exerted himself and slipt in so as to have his face upon the bank and lie partly out of the water that he received two violent blows as he was falling with large sticks or whips that some of them had sticks as big as a man s wrist that then one man struck him upon the eye and another gave him a blow that took away his senses that he soon recovered and seeing the smugglers in confusion and imagining that Playford and Warren were come to his assistance he exerted himself and got out of the water that as he was rising a smuggler upon a bald-faced horse lifted up a whip or stick and threatened to knock him down upon that recollecting he had a pistol in his waistcoat pocket he presented it to him upon which he gave back that then Playford and Warren distinguished him and Playford gave him his sword he had wrested a whip from one of the smugglers which he kept for his own defence that then he and Playford stood back to back and one of the smugglers who was on his right struck at the pistol and knocked the cock down but being wet it did not go off that at the same time another attacked him on the left with a large stick many times which he held in both hands because it was too large for one he described that man to be about the size and shape of the prisoner that he was obliged to use the sword with his left hand while he held the pistol in his right that he pricked him three times with his sword that the last time he cut him on the cheek under the left eye upon which he gave back a little which gave him an opportunity of changing his sword to his right hand being released from the man he had presented the pistol at that the smuggler continued to press upon him with his stick upon which he pushed at him very hard that he had a loose riding coat in which seemed to prevent the sword penetrating that the second time the sword went through his clothes and the third thrust he stabbed him just under the left breast that then the man left him and the smugglers collected together and went off with their goods that he found three tubs of brandy in the road and then Hubbard came up and informed them that his horse had run away with him and had thrown him that then Warren and Playford went in pursuit of the smugglers and Hubbard went in search of his horse he returned with his horse and a fourth cask of brands which they found in the road just beyond where the attack was made that the man on the bald faced horse and another came up swore at him and threatened him upon which he presented a pistol to them that he had received from Playford upon which they went swearing away towards Hubbard that he went to Hubbard s relief and presently met him who told him that the smugglers had taken the casks from him and had threatned to murder him but he said he knew them that they were Will Skinner Joe Skinner and Thomas Butcher that then Hubbard went away to shift for himself and he went to a house for some relief as he was wounded much and had lost a great quantity of blood John Hubbard confirmed the evidence of Jacob Garrard as far as he was concerned and deposed that the prisoner was one of the smugglers and that he had known him from a child and that there were also William Skinner and Joseph Skinner and also that he opened the staves of one of the casks he found upon the road with his knife and tasted the contents which was brandy Mathew Warren confirmed the evidence of Garrard and Hubbard as far as he was concerned and produced a very large stick which he said he took from the man whose face was bloody and that the stick was bloody when he took it - Gill deposed that he saw Hubbard on the 2d of May and that then Hubbard told him that the two Skinners and the prisoner were part of that company and that he was present when the prisoner was examined before the Justice on the 26th of May that he had then the mark of a wound in his face which he said he received by a kick from a horse that the justice asked him if he had not got a wound in his left breast that he denied it that he described what part of the breast Garrard had wounded the man as Garrard had informed him and that upon examining the prisoner there was the mark of a wound newly skinned over just in the place he had described which appeared to have been given by the point of a sharp instrument and that the prisoner said that wound also was given by the kick of a horse Robert Playford confirmed the evidence already given as far as he was concerned The prisoner in his defence denied the charge and in order to falsify Hubbard s testimony he called John Stamford who deposed that he lay in the same bed with William Skinner at Kaple in Surry on the 1st of May George Sayer Mary Hooker and John Mills confirmed this evidence He called Edward Rossiter who deposed that the prisoner was slightly kicked in the face by a mare while he was dressing her and in the side being asked to explain that he said the mare kicked with both legs Thomas Skinner his master deposed that he left his house to go to bed between nine and ten on the 30th of April and that he saw him at work between three and four the next morning and that his horse is about four miles from Greetham Bridge upon his cross examination he acknowledged he Skinner had himself paid 70 l for smuggling and James Butler Esq a magistrate for the County of Sussex deposed that John Hubbard bears a very bad character and it was his opinion that he ought not to be believed upon his oath Guilty T 
t17870110-52  211 JAMES LESLIE was indicted for that he being one of the officers of the excise of our Lord the King after the 29th of September 1783 to wit on the 2d of March last with force and arms being such officer of the excise as aforesaid unlawfully knowingly and feloniously did give and grant a certain false and untrue permit for removal of seventy-five gallons of foreign brandy being an excisable commodity from the stock of one Catherine Bolton widow a dealer in such commodity and to be received and had into the stock of one Thomas Hardy against the statute He was also charged in three other counts for the like offence The indictment opened by Mr Silvester and the case opened by Mr Solicitor General Counsel for the Crown Mr SOLICITOR GENERAL Mr SERJEANT WALKER and Mr SILVESTER Counsel for the Prisoner Mr PLOMER and Mr GARROW JOSEPH NORRIS sworn I am the permitter of the excise I know the prisoner he was a brandy officer of the excise in March last I was in the same division in the eleventh division in the permit office in Lancaster-court in the Strand on the first of March last the prisoner came to me with a request note this is the note which he brought in his hand to me Produced and read Permit Thomas Hardy Cullum-street one cask F Brandy 75 gall part stock of Cath Bolton Golden-cross Charing-cross William Claridge cellar-man March 1st 1786 go by cart In consequence of that request note did you give that permit - I did Who did you deliver the permit to - To the prisoner who is the officer who brought the request note When did you see the prisoner again - Not that night I saw him again the next morning he came between seven and eight the next morning into the office he then took the permit out of his waistcoat pocket and said he had carried that permit to Bolton s last night but they had altered their minds and would not send out the goods till the next morning he then said I wish you would write another and I will take it down to Bolton s and give it to Claridge I then took the note and told him there was some before they must stay till their turn the prisoner said then give me your foreign book and I will write it in the hurry of business any officer makes out permits he sat down and wrote but before that he says which is the file where the note is I said this is the file because says he I shall alter the day of the month from the 1st to the 2d this is the request note it stood the 1st when I wrote it and now there is the number 2 over the No 1 when he had done that he sat down and wrote and cut the permit out of the book and I saw the permit in his hand this is the permit book in which it is wrote he then said he would return the permit which I had granted the day before and write another when it is wrote it is cut out of the permit book he returned my permit and signed it Where is that - When he signed it I had nothing more to do with it Look at that book - Here is the word return in this permit book which the prisoner wrote himself upon the checque that I granted at first the prisoner in his own hand writing has written returned the prisoner himself kept that permit it was his business to keep it after he had wrote returned upon it he said he was going to Bolton s and he would take the permit with him and give it to Claridge he cut out the permit after he had filled it up and I saw the permit in his hand I saw him write in my book this is the permit this is the prisoner s hand writing Is that agreeable to that checque of the 2d of March - It is both the counter part and the permit are of the prisoner s hand writing I know the prisoner very well he has been in the office seven or eight years How long have you been in the same place - Three years It is not usual for the stocking officer to assist in granting permits - Very often in the hurry of business I believe it is often usual for the trader to apply to the stocking officer to get a permit for him - Very often A trader some times sends his porter or any body to the office with a request note for a permit - Yes There is a railing that divides you from the person that comes to apply - Yes He delivers in his request note - Yes Sometimes he is seen through the rail sometimes he sticks it on the rails and asks how long will it be - Yes The permit writer is governed by the request note and then looks at the credit book - Yes I would ask you if it does not frequently happen that persons who are unknown to the permit writers bring these request notes - They say they come from such a trader and this is the note and how long will it be before it is done Very often they are porters or persons that you do not personally know - Yes Then you or any body may be deceived in that way - They may Suppose any body should send a porter to the permit office whom you do not know but with a request note you look at the credit book and you grant the permit though you do not know the person that brought the request note - I do On the 1st of March you had granted a permit of this very quantity of liquor from Bolton s - I had which Leslie came back and said it had never been out of his possession there was an entry made of returned and it could not be made out after that Is not the permit which you have produced upon the proper excise paper - Yes If the request note was a good one and had been really Mrs Bolton s request note then this permit was perfectly regular was it not - It was It was properly filled up and properly signed and perfectly regular the only doubt was about the request note - Yes I believe it sometimes happens that a porter or trader delivers to the stocking officer the request note and then the stocking officer having communication with the office he delivers it to the office and gets the permit - He does sometimes Who keeps the credit book - It is in the permit book as a guide to the permit writer Have you got the credit book here - No I have not Does your permit differ from the permit in question in any other respect than the day of the month - No it is exactly the same he said he should only alter the day of the month from the 1st to the 2d Do you remember a former instance of a request note signed by this Bolton to Hardy No 66 see if that is your hand writing - Looks at it - It is my hand writing I cannot say who brought this this is a request note of Thomas Hardy of Cullum-street to Catherine Bolton of Charing-cross that is January 1786 sixty-four gallons that was granted by me upon some request note Mr Walker Who was the stocking officer at Mrs Bolton s - Mr Leslie the prisoner at the bar called upon me the 1st of March and he brought the request note and gave it to me Who keeps the credit in the books of stock - The stocking officer he puts in the credit what credit they have What means has the stocking officer to know whether the request note be right or no - He can tell by this book on the 2d of March between seven and eight he came again JACOB HARPUR sworn I am a surveyor of the excise the prisoner was an officer under me Was it his duty to stock Mrs Bolton - It was he was the stocking officer of that division Tell the Court what you know of this transaction - I went up into the permit office some time from the 2d of March to the 13th of April I cannot pretend to say what day to examine the notes when I went up Leslie the prisoner followed me up I asked for the file where the notes were filed on it was given to me and I found a request note dated the 1st of March originally and a figure of 2 was made over it the 1 was not put out I made a query on it the prisoner acknowledged that he altered it I told him it might be attended with bad consequences I rebuked him he said he could not think there could be much harm in altering the note I told him it would be well for him if it did not then I left the permit office and went about my usual business on the 13th of April I compared Leslie s permits which he had taken up at different houses Mr Garrow Have you got them here - No Then we must not hear of them as they are not evidence Mr Silvester What is become of the permits - They are lost Mr Garrow If they were here I should submit they are no evidence in this case - In examining these permits Leslie read in to me 129 gallons to Mrs Bolton Court Give us some more account about reading in - He compared the books I had the stock book in my hand and he had the permits and he read to me 129 gallons into Mrs Bolton s stock I do not know whether he particularly mentioned Dunnage s stock then we were examining every body s stock and this was in the course of the reading What did you suppose him reading from - I supposed him reading from a permit I remarked the quantity says I let me look at that permit says he it is no matter it is no permit at all then he said hehad lost the permit I told him if he had lost it I suspected it was no permit at all he shewed me the paper this is the paper I was going to make a memorandum of it he said he would save me that trouble for there was no such permit ever came and that nobody knew any thing about the matter but himself What was to be the effect of your memorandum - In order to go and search if such a permit was ever granted from Dunnage or not from his stock in consequence of this after he declared that to me I told him I should go and take Mrs Bolton s stock it was read into me as so much stock posted to her credit from Dunnage he begged I would not go and take Mrs Bolton s stock he said if I did go that it was all over with him or words to that effect and he threw down the book on the desk he requested me to let him go to Claridge to get the increase out of the way for I should find about 20 gallons increase Claridge is the cellarman to Mrs Bolton Mr Garrow I desire the Court will give me leave to ask a question to see whether any part of this history that we have had applies when was the whole of this written Was it produced to you in that state at the time that he produced it to you - It was What is meant by the words 16th of March - I do not know Does that appear to be the date of the permit upon which the quantity had been removed - I do not know Does not that paper import that the removal was on the 16th of March - I do not know what that was for at all his books were lost so that I cannot charge my memory Mr Silvester He told you there was no such permit - He did I told him I never should agree to any such thing and he run away to Mrs Bolton s he was rather in the house before me he had got down into the cellar I went down after him and went into the cellar and took the stock he desired me to make it as easy as I could when I got there the prisoner was much confused and so was the cellarman indeed who said he did not know the consequence of it I took the stock in a very circumspect manner and upon balancing the same afterwards at the office I found fourteen gallons increase of foreign brandy Had you any conversation with him before you left the office at any time about this transaction with Hardy - Yes but I do not know that Hardy s name was particularly mentioned it was concerning the matter in the books Was there any thing concerning this permit now in question - I told him on the 13th of April that I should not only go and take Mrs Bolton s stock but I should likewise ask her whether she ever dealt with such a person as Hardy or whether she ever sent any such quantities he replied as I had no occasion for it was all his own doing entirely for Mrs Bolton nor Claridge nor Dunnage knew nothing about it and he would clear them of every thing when we were at the house I told Claridge what had passed between us and the cause of my coming he declared in the prisoner s presence that he knew nothing at all of it nor had he sent any such quantities I told him I thought it was right for me to acquaint Mrs Bolton of it I went up stairs and told her the whole circumstance Was the prisoner present - I believe he was but I am not positive Explain to us the consequence of conveying this idea of stock from Dunnage to Mrs Bolton Mr Garrow That is mere matter of opinion and I object to it being put in that way Court To be sure that is only matter of opinion that the Jury will form as well as he Mr Garrow How long have you served in the district where the prisoners has been the stocking officer - Three years or thereabouts He has been under your immediate controul and direction - He has How often is it usual for you to examine the state of the permits - At all opportunities that I thought proper but once in a month that is the usual way After you have examined them there is another examination at the excise office - I apprehend so I suppose the permits are sent there as a checque upon my examination I have been three years in that division I have officiated before I have been about twenty-seven years in the employ Does it frequently happen that a permit is mislaid - Often times When that is the case how is that quantity which would appear to be an illegal increase accounted for - If these permits that are missing cannot be found they are reported by the surveyor to the board lost or mislaid That is a subject of considerable blame in the officer - Yes Then he is bound to give you some account - To be sure As in the present instance the prisoner gave you an account from Dunnage - Yes Take this paper - He read this to me for 129 gallons of brandy consigned to Mrs Bolton from Dunnage s stock What is the meaning of the word Thompson - I imagine it to be the permit writer there is a permit writer of that name I have known him many years he is not here Is he in Dunnage s division - I do not know Does it not appear to you that it meant to convey this information to you that upon the 16th of March such a permit had been passed - I cannot give any explanation about it this is a memorandum of the prisoner s in order to deceive me in reading in or it is a paper of his own Did not you understand that memorandum to import that on the 16th of March such a permit had been wrote - I cannot say what it was for Can you find any number upon it - Here is 119 which is more likely to be the number of the permit than the 28 to my recollection that 129 gallons was entered before the 2d of March the book is not here I did not know Dunnage I believe he is in the second division CATHERINE BOLTON sworn I keep the Golden-cross Charing-cross Do you deal with any person of the name of Thomas Hardy - No I have no dealings with any such person if any such was had it was without my consent Are you a dealer in foreign spirits - Yes Under whose survey was you - The prisoner s at that time WILLIAM CLARIDGE sworn I lived with Mrs Bolton last March I have lived there between six and seven years cellarman and waiter Did your mistress ever deal with Thomas Hardy - Not to my knowledge Did she ever desire you to make a request note to carry any goods there - No Look at that is that your hand writing - No Do you know the prisoner - Yes Who was the stocking officer last March to your mistress - James Leslie was there at times since that and before Mr Plomer I believe you used sometimes to send the request notes by the porter - Yes the first that came if the porters were not in the way I carried them sometimes myself Serjeant Walker Who wrote these request notes - I cannot say Did the prisoner come to your house on the 2d of March - I cannot charge my memory with any particular time he was there with Mr Hubbard but what day I cannot tell they came to take stock they gauged every cask of wine and spirits ISAAC PACKER sworn I am an officer of excise I survey Mr Hardy in Cullum-street What is he - A dealer in brandy I served him as such What is that you have in your hand - A permit for seventy-five gallons of brandy to be received into the stock of Thomas Hardy Did you receive it into the stock - I did and gave credit for it accordingly Look at that paper is there any thing in the substance of it - Yes the words excise office Hardy is since dead Mr Garrow You know nothing how Hardy got that - No Was it filled up as it is now - It was a regular permit filled up Mr Silvester By virtue of that paper you gave him credit for seventy-five gallons of brandy - Yes I took it in by virtue of this permit Read No 138 Lancaster-court 3 1/4 86 J Norris 11th division Permit Thomas Hardy Cullum-street to receive one cask of foreign brandy seventy-five gallons No 100 part of the stock of Catherine Bolton Witness my hand this 2d day of March 1786 This permit to be in force one hour for the goods to be sent out from Mrs Boulton s stock and two hours more for the same to be delivered and received into Mr Hardy s stock Prisoner I leave it to my counsel Mr Garrow If you wish to explain to my Lord and the Jury how this transaction was you must do it yourself Prisoner I received a paper from a porter who came and requested a permit for seventy-five gallons of brandy I carried it to Mr Norris who wrote the same I carried it to that person who brought it back and said he wanted another for the next morning I wrote the other by Mr Norris s desire and delivered it to the person who came for it now if this note had been a false note so long after as a month or six weeks it might have been destroyed but I believe it to be a true one it was fairly wrote and posted as the usual course of business was Mr Garrow to Norris Had the prisoner an opportunity to destroy this note if he chose it - He certainly had it was upon the file hanging up openly in the office he had abundant opportunities he could come at the file if he chose if the note had been gone there would have been nothing to have answered to the counter part of the permit Mr Garrow It would have appeared by your counter part that the first of these permits had been granted at the request of the trader - Yes the second would have appeared to have been made on the other and the request note lost Mr Plomer Does it not often happen that the request notes are lost - I do not know of any The prisoner called thirteen witnesses who all gave him a very good character GUILTY Transported for seven years Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr Justice ASHURST 
t18210912-89  1136 WILLIAM SUTHERIN was indicted for feloniously knowingly and willingly accepting and receiving a false forged and counterfeit certificate forged &c to the likeness and similitude of a true certificate authorised and required to be granted by certain officers of the Excise by virtue of an Act of Parliament now in force immediately before the passing of an act 41 George III well knowing the same to be forged and counterfeited THIRTY-SIX OTHER COUNTS varying the manner of laying the charge MESSRS BOLLAND and WALFORD conducted the prosecution RICHARD JONES I am surveyor of the Tobacco Warehouse in the Excise I have been forty-seven years in the service The tobacco imported is deposited in the London Docks or Excise till the duties are paid When the merchant wants his tobacco he gives notice at the Tobacco Office it is then weighed and the officer who weighs it sends an account to the office of the weight and gives another to the merchant the officer makes out one account for himself the merchant makes out one for himself and the officer signs the one the merchant has The officer deposits his account in our office and the merchant takes the other to the collector The amount of duty is ascertained from the weight at the collector s office and paid by the merchant the collector then gives him a certificate of its having been paid and the merchant endorses the landing marks number of the import and delivery weights and the person to whom it is to be delivered Q Look at this is it such an instrument as is given at the collector s office - A It is after this the merchant carries the certificate signed by the collector to the comptroller s office for his signature It then comes to our office The prisoner was a clerk in our office in the permit seat it was part of his duty to examine these certificates when presented He has the custody of the weighing officer s note and is to compare the certificate with it and to examine the certificate and see if the signatures of the collector and comptroller is correct but we are not very nice about these things but we are always particular in comparing the note with the certificate if he is satisfied that it is correct he gives the broker or merchant a permit and puts the certificate in the drawer The certificates and permits are always numbered Q Should the two numbers correspond - A No sometimes it is omitted to put the number of the permit on the certificate There are also counterparts of the permits There is a book kept in which the certificates are entered - We call it the duty-paid ledger It was the prisoner s duty to enter the certificates in that ledger in the course of the week as we compare accounts at the end of the week and make them up and a voucher is drawn which is a copy of of the duty-paid ledger It was the prisoner s business to make out the voucher it should contain an account of all the certificates granted in the course of the week When the voucher is made out it is examined with the duty-paid ledger and the certificates are also compared with it It is also compared with the counterpart the certificates are always compared with the counterpart of the permits they then go to another clerk who enters them in the import ledger and they are laid up in weekly bundles Q Then the certificates of the preceding week would not be in the drawer - A No I believe they are sometimesleft in for a fortnight but then the first week s are always tied in a bundle the bundle is not always made up at the end of the week At the latter end of July I think on a Tuesday I received some information from the clerks and set about making enquiry and saw the prisoner I think he told me there was a double No 198 of the certificate meaning that there was two certificates of that number I think this was on Monday I went with him afterwards to Mr Mayo s office and as we went along he said I think I had better not say any thing about No 202 which was another certificate I compared the permits and ledger with Mr Phipps the general surveyor Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q Where is your office - A By the Docks He had been four years in our office I know Mr Grant he was clerk to his cousin who is a broker he was to pay the money He absconded about a month ago it was before I was at Bow-street Q The prisoner remained at the office - A The 10th of August was the last day he was there We went to Bow-street ten days after The discovery was made a fortnight or three weeks before Q You are not very nice about examining the signature of the collector - A No we do not always know them as they are often changed The permits are not always issued in their regular order of numbers - the certificates are put in a drawer which is open to all the clerks I never saw a broker go to it I believe it is not locked Q The voucher is a copy of the ledger and ought to contain the week s certificate - A Yes if a certificate is omitted it will not agree with the collector s account Q Was not the enquiry suggested by the prisoner himself in consequence of his having made complaint about Grant who has absconded - A He made a complaint about No 198 I have never seen Grant since The prisoner complained of Grant MR WALFORD Q The double number that the prisoner disclosed was No 198 - A Yes he mentioned no other number to me His seat is railed in JAMES CROUCH I am a tobacco warehouse-keeper in the same office as the prisoner It is my duty to call at the collector s office every Monday morning to get the account of duties received during the week for the purpose of checking the account The office is on Tower-hill - I called on Monday the 30th of July and took an account of the amount of the duties myself and gave it to the prisoner I produce it The number of hogshead is eighty-three of pounds 113 552 the amount of duty 22 646 l 8 s his duty was to sign a check against his own account if they agree together in number and amount of money if he found them correct he was to call the warrant over against the duty-paid ledger - he makes up his vouchers from the certificate which he sends to the chief office as a charge on the collector Q Did you continue at the office that morning - A Yes The prisoner said to me that the account I had brought up did not agree and the difference was the amount of a certificate paid by Mr Grant I think he named 327 l odd as the amount Mr Jones came into the office and he named it to him I knew Robert Grant his business frequently called him to our office the prisoner and he seemed very good friends merely passing civilities nothing more that I saw - I have seen them go out of the office together occasionally Robert Grant came to the office that day and I think brought down some warrants Sutherin named something to him about double numbers I heard Grant say he knew he had paid the duties and that was all he cared about I have not seen him since Q On the next day Tuesday the 31st of July did Jones direct you to make out a search - A Yes to see where the error laid and could not discover any weighing bill tallying with the warrant Between three and four o clock in the afternoon I Hoare and Henler made further search the office shuts at four o clock they came and wished to look at the warrants paid by Grant on the preceding day the 30th I opened the drawer in the prisoner s seat which contained the warrants and took them out they examined them I know Mr Smith the collector to the best of my belief the signature is not his writing I do not know about Wright s signature Q Was it found in a bundle tied up or how - A Loose The bundle of the preceding week was in the drawer not tied up but folded up Q Now turn to the ledger and tell me whether there is any entry there of No 202 - A There are two of No 202 I saw the account when there was no double entry of No 202 that account is not now in the ledger the entry is made by the prisoner and so was the first that I saw On Wednesday the 1st of August I saw the prisoner making entries in the ledger from a loose leaf not then attached to the book but it was a leaf of the ledger and the same I saw in it before it was ruled exactly the same and in his writing I do not know what became of it Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Grant was a respectable decent young man - A Yes There was no particular familiarity between him and the prisoner The prisoner was the first person who spoke of the warrant No 198 and that set the enquiry afloat respecting this I heard him talking to him in the office about double numbers and after that I saw Grant no more If I took the certificate up in a cursory way I might not notice that it was not Smith s signature I know when he was absent he sent a sick note MR BOLLAND Q Have you the counterpart of the permit - A Yes of No 202 COURT Q Does the account you got from the collector contain either No 198 or 202 - A No I delivered it to the prisoner to examine he said it did not correspond as to 198 198 was entered in his voucher and his book but 202 was not in his account and his account was 327 l and odd more than the collector s but it had No 198 in it WILLIAM PAUL I am clerk in the tobacco office I am acquainted with the prisoner and his hand-writing looks at the duplicate of the permit it appears to be a counterpart of a permit for this certificate -

A Yes ALEXANDER GRANT I am a broker and live in George-street Tower-hill I have occasion to clear large quantities of tobacco In July last Robert Grant was in my service on the 26th of that month I directed him to clear five hogsheads of tobacco for which I gave him a check of 303 l 19 s for one hogshead and Fish and Co furnished him with the money for the others I produce the check which I got from my bankers the amount of duty is 303 l 16 s 2 s rent and 1 s Dock charges the other four hogsheads were for Fish and Co St John-street the duty on them was 1146 l 4 s rent 8 s charges 4 s and the transfer on thirty-one hogsheads 5 l 2 s making altogether 1135 l 1 s 2 d On the Tuesday morning following I was at the Collector s office on business and met Crouch and heard from him that there was a mistake in a warrant he requested me to look into my books and see if such a hogshead No 198 was cleared on that day I did and went to the office to find a duplicate-paper of the warrant but could not and informed Crouch and Jones they found the hogshead had been cleared but could not find the duplicate - I knew the tobacco was cleared he then informed me the warrant was supposed to be a forgery after which I came back from the office and not having seen my young man all the day raised my suspicions In coming from the Dock at the corner of the street where I live I met the prisoner he asked me where Robert my young man was to be found or where his friends lived as he must and would see him I told him his mother lived in Hans-square Sloane-street and said I was going myself to Clapham where his brother lived He wished me to go home and dine with him I said my mind was too much agitated and I would go to Clapham immediately to seek the young man out if I could -

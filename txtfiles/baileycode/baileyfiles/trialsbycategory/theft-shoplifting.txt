Examin d Q How do you know this to be that hair you seem to be so positive about Burcket Because it is a particular sort which I never had before since I was in business my reason for knowing it is before it was manufactured in a different way it was of a yellow grey and it is customary to improve the colour but this is reduc d which I did for a particular customer Q Does no body wear flaxen but he Burcket Yes Sir many but I did it to oblige him as a particular customary for there is more got by improving it then by reducing it Q Was never such a thing done before Burcket I don t think it ever was Q Do you think you are the only man in the world that has so ardent a desire to oblige a customer Burcket It being for a particular customer I did not care if I did not get so much by it so that I might oblige him it is to every man s interest to oblige his customers Q What colour was it before Burcket A yellow grey and it is made worse by that change Q Have you no other reason to know it then by the altering the colour Burcket I know it by the quantity besides the colour Q Why do you think these hairs singular from all others Burcket I believe there are no hairs of that colour so

Burcket Yes and they found nothing upon him but the hairs he had bought Q How much had he bought Burcket Three quarters of an ounce Q Has he ever bought hairs of you before Burcket Yes Sir several times small quantities but here is a person in court who has bought 40 or 50 pounds worth of the Prisoner how he came by it I know not I have missed hairs divers times and have great reason to suspect him before this Q Did you never sell such hairs to any person as these you take upon you to swear to Burcket Yes I have sold some to a person that is gone into Shropshire Q How do you know but these very hairs are the same you sold to that person Burcket I believe they are not the man it a stranger in London and comes up to town may be once in 7 years Q Then these hairs that lie there may be the very same hairs you sold the person that is gone down in Shropshire for ought you know Burcket I do not believe they be Q Do you know one Freeman a Barber Burcket I do he was there at the public house Q Do you remember any talk on this sort that if you did not prosecute Wood he would put such a paragraph in the news-paper that should ruin you in your business Burcket He said I ought to prosecute the Prisoner else I ought to be exposed or something to that purpose Q Is not this prosecution carried on at the expence of the parish of St Clements-Danes Burcket It is not Sir Q Are you sure this

wrapp d up in a paper and laid in the window just at the door of the cellar Thomas Johnson I have known the Prisoner 3 or 4 months he came to my brother s the Prosecutor s house the 31st of Oct We had reason to suspect we had been robb d by the Prisoner so we agreed to watch him he came to our house and we show d him several drawers of hairs he bought 3 quarters of an ounce of brown hairs he was going away and return d again and desired to see the flaxen drawer I gave him all the opportunity I could as there were two people set to observe him in the little room at the end of the counter the drawer was set upon the counter A man from the other side of the water had told me he had seen such quantities of hairs by him that he thought he could not come honestly by Q Have you no prejudices against him Johnson No Sir I have not Thomas Commings On the 31st of Oct the Prisoner came to my master s shop to buy hairs and as we had reason to suspect him I went into a little room from whence I might watch him I saw him steal from different drawers twice then Mr Duff came into the room to me after that both he and I saw him steal several quantities from different drawers particularly out of the flaxen drawer he lean d upon the counter the drawer stood on it he took up the locks of hair and drew them thro his fingers and slid them into his pocket at last there came in a little child with its aunt in which he used seemingly to take delight and used to give it apples &c He took up two degrees of the flaxen hairs and stoop d to the child crying Dilley Dilley Dilley to it shaking it in the child s face then artfully gather d it up in his palm of his hand putting his thumb over it and so slid it into his pocket Mr Duff and I both observ d it distinctly I saw Mrs Bristol in the shop and am sure she was in such a place she might see him take the hair Cross Examined Q What is that flaxen hairs worth per oz Commings They are sold for 8 s per oz Q How many times did you see him take hairs Commings I believe I saw him steal that day 5 times and when we examin d him there were Mr Freeman Mr Burcket and I when the Prisoner confessed he stole 2 degrees of hairs and he said he had thrown them down the stairs backwards John Duff I was at Mr Burcket s this night He went on and confirm d what was said by the last witness as to what they saw Wood the Prisoner steal while they were sitting together in the little room and also added that he heard the Prisoner acknowledge at the alehouse that if Mr Burcket would forgive him he would give him a guinea for every lock he had taken and said to the best of his knowledge the Prisoner owned to the stealing 5 locks and in his cross examination strengthened the foregoing without any contradiction saying he came out of the little room with an intent to search him but Mr Rawlison coming in he went to the alehouse and went out from thence with an intent to fetch a constable but found when he returned the Prisoner had slipp d out as he thought he had some mistrust and put the hair away Mrs Bristow Mr Burcket s wife is my sister I was at his house at this time drinking a dish of tea as my brother could not come into the back room I carried him a dish of tea into the shop the Prisoner was then looking on the brown hairs handling it and turning it round his fingers I look d earnestly at him and saw him clinch his hand and put his thumb over it and put it into his pocket I carried my brother another dish and then he had a lock of flaxen hairs in his hand and I saw him do the same to that I went back to my sister and said he is robbing you now I knew of Mr Commings and Mr Duff seeing then to watch him Joseph Rawlinson I had seen the Prisoner at times to have such quantities of hairs that I thought he could not come honestly by and knowing him some time to have bought small quantities of the prosecutor who had often times lost hairs I told him of it and on the 31st of Oct I saw Mr Wood in this shop I had sent word I would come that night I asked him where Mr Burcket was he said at the Cole-Hole I asked Mr Wood if he would go and drink with me and Mr Commings I knew nothing that they had been watching him

bought and paid for but before he came out of the room he acknowledged he had stole two degrees we desired to know what he had done with them he said he had flung them down the back stairs we went and searched the back part of the house to the Savoy but could find none Q What is this flaxen hair worth per oz Freeman It is worth 8 or 9 s per oz I went with them to justice Fieldings the Prisoner desired me to speak in his behalf to Mr Burcket said I what can I say said I to Mr Burcket I shall think you as great a villain as Wood if you don t prosecute him you ll both rob yourself and the world if you neglect it The Prisoner in his defence acknowledg d he was at the Prosecutor s but denied he stole any hairs and that at the alehouse he went out to do his occasions and when Commings return d and taxed him about it he never confessed as the witnesses had deposed He called four people to his character John Serby I have known the Prisoner ten years and have been acquainted with him

pairs Elvington I believe these may be them they lay upon a bundle Q Was that bundle near where Cole stood Elvington They were pretty near her Q Look at the outside of this bundle Do you remember whether this lay on the counter Elvington I can t really say but I believe it might Master desired me to fetch them back I went and desired them to come back which they did very willingly Then master charged them with taking a pair of stockings and insisted upon their being searched Immediately Ann Cole pull d off her cloak and apron and desired to go into the little room to be searched At the same time master was on the opposite side of the counter He leap d over the counter and took up those stockings from behind a rail where were some old stockings to hang for a shew and said you need not to search any farther for I have found them again on the ground holding the stockings up at the same time I believe these to be the same except he has changed them since I left him Q Whereabouts did he take them up from Elvington He found them behind the door at the upper end of the shop behind a rail that lay on the ground Q Where were the women at the time Elvington They were near the door then not a great way off Q How far were the stockings found from Ann Cole Elvington I believe she was near a yard from them Q Where was you at the time Elvington I was on the same side of the counter

not Q When did you first see them Elvington When my master had them in his hand Q Then how do you know that he had pick d them up Elvington According to his own words He said you need not search any

near that place Q Whose stockings are these Elvington I believe they are my master s property On the 10th of February I was at work in my frame Master came and with several protestations told me he would prosecute the two prisoners to the utmost of his power and desired me to do the same saying we shall have two Tyburn tickets which will be worth 10 l each and he would give me one of them Then he asked me if I saw the prisoner Cole drop the stockings I said no I did not His answer to me was no more did I but sure enough they had them and I ll prosecute them to the utmost of my power which

any thing to your master when they went out of the shop Elvington I went to him and said have you shifted a pair of rib d stockings from this place he said no then I said I am apprehensive those women have taken them Q Why did you apprehend so Elvington Because I had seen a pair of stockings lying there open and when they were gone I did not see them Council for prisoner Is it not an easy matter

women at the bar and he could not tell how it was but wish d he was not mistaken Q Who was present at this declaration White There were several people but I know none in particular it is a house that I generally call to drink at when I go that way He said he would take any thing that was offered him if he could do it with safety but he was under the direction of Mr Fielding Next day I was with him

was chairwoman to my lodger and sometimes used to work for me when I had occasion in mending of things She came first to beg for work about the beginning of January last and worked for me at times till she was taken up in my house on the 12th of November last Q Did she lie in your house M J Langham No she did not I first took up one Cooksey about the 17th of May who had used to go on errands for me and work for some of my lodgers but I was soon satisfied of her innocence and Justice Welch discharged her I was sure the prisoner had taken some things the day before I took her up The prisoner Smith and she lived together as man and wife I got a search warrant and took Mr Clay and another constable and went and search d their lodgings She gave us the key of the door at Mr Welch s There I found a considerable quantity of goods watch trinkets and other things hid in a paper bag behind a bolster here is one particular etwee and snuff box which I can be very positive to found among the rest Producing it with several other things necklaces &c Q What may these be worth M J Langham They are worth 40 or 50 shillings I know them all to be my property Her lodgings were at Mrs Mears s in Eagle-street near the Horse and groom Q Did you see Smith at her lodgings M J Langham No I did not The account she gave me for herself was that she was forced to rob me by the ill usage of her husband as she then called him she said her memory was so bad that she could not recollect the particulars but she had pawned a great many things at Mr Bibby s She went there along with us she asked for six or seven boxes they produced eleven patch boxes and snuff boxes Produced in court The prisoner helped me to pack up these in a hamper in order to go to Blackheath fair about the beginning of May She said she had sold the counterpane in Mount-street to Mrs Rhemas We went there and found it Produced in court This was in my house the beginning of May I am charged four guineas and a half for it in case I do not return it where I deal We found some pawnbrokers tickets in her lodgings which directed us to Mr Watson s a pawnbroker We went there and found six tortoiseshell

against him and found him in the house where he and she lodged I miss a great quantity of goods that I cannot find but Clements said at the Justice s that when I turned my back then she used to take things out of my shop Q When did you first see Smith M J Langham I first saw him when we took him the same night as she was taken up on the day He was carried to Justice Welch s He persisted in it that he knew nothing of the matter till the next day when he was re-examined then the Justice desired him to give an account of what he had done with the things This was after he was searched and a pair of buckles and three stayhooks were found in his pocket Then he own d to the apron that was produced to him that he had sold it to a woman that is now sick in her bed for 12 s her name is Degell The apron buckles and staybooks produced and deposed to Smith was asked where he had these things He said he had them of Betty meaning Clements The apron was cut from a piece of muslin which she own d she had taken and she said he had it of her with other goods to sell He owned also that he had had a necklace and some ribbands of her which we had found He owned to nothing but what we had found This muslin that this apron is made of I sell for 7 s a yard and here is two yards of this Q Did you ever trust the prisoner Clements to sell goods for you M J Langham No never Mr Clay the constable confirmed the account given by the prosecutrix as to Clements s confessing she stole the goods mentioned and carried them to Smith their finding some at their lodgings and pawnbrokers and that Smith owned he had sold the apron to Mrs Degell and begged Mercy of the prosecutrix Jane Jackson I live now in Fuller s Rents The prisoner Smith was opening some muslin at a coffee-house I brought a striped apron of him Produced in court M J Langham I have all the reason in the world to believe this my property it is the same stripe of that I lost and every way answering to it Margaret Mead I live in Orange-street Red-lion-square I brought an odd remnant of ribband of the prisoner Smith there was about two yards and a half of it Produced in court Q What trade is he M Mead He is a carpenter Q Do you know Clements M Mead I never saw her before to my knowlege Ann Chaliner I never saw the woman at the bar till in this place I live at the Horseshoe and Magpie in Middle-row I bought a yard and half of ribband and a necklace of the prisoner Smith Produced in court I believe I bought the necklace five months ago M J Langham This necklace is mine and the ribband with the other ribband bought by Mrs Mead are of the same sort that I lost Eliz Griffin I bought a piece of muslin of Mrs Degell Q Was Smith by at the time E Griffin No he was not Judith Rhemas I have known Clements a great many years I bought this counterpane here produced of her I gave 26 shillings for it and when I could sell it for more I was to give it her Eliz Hutchinson I remember passing through the room of Mrs Degell when a man was selling her some muslin but I cannot say I know the man Mrs Mears I live in Eagle-street The two prisoners lodged together in my house about three weeks or a month Q How long is that

till after he was taken up Clements s Defence Mrs Langham entrusted me to sell goods for her when she has been out of town and wanted me to go to fairs with her Smith s Defence I always thought she was trusted to sell things for Mrs Langham I know she used to be at her house and sell things for her and go about on her business not that I was there myself These things I sold That apron I believe to be the same I thought she had it of her mistress to sell and never knew to the contrary I know she has been trusted with a great many things I never knew she would wrong any body of any-thing but I can never believe she had a quarter of the things she is charged with Q to Prosecutrix Did you ever trust Clements to sell Goods for you Prosecutrix No only once She had an India handkerchief of me to put about her husband s neck but she never had any of those goods to sell for me For Clements Mrs Barlow I know Mrs Langham has trusted Clements to sell Fire-works on Illumination Nights I have seen her helping in the shop on such nights but I do not know she ever trusted her with any thing else in the shop Mrs Foreman I know the prisoner Clements used to be to and from in Mrs Langham s house but I never knew her to employ her in any particular thing but in fire-works if she had I should have known it for I had used to employ her myself I have often heard her talk of her husband but I never saw Smith till before the Justice For Smith Mr Silvester I have known Smith from his infancy he is a carpenter and was some time with Mr Philips the king s carpenter he bears a good character Q How

William Davis William Till Thomas Erkenn which he gave me by the name of Tom the footman and Henry Palmerston there were William Daniel and William Lebat that are not yet taken these made up the eight When we carried Davis to the Round-house he seemed very much vexed that Millar had used him in that manner and said he would give me an account of all the rest I said if you will any way assist in taking them I will endeavour to be as favourable to you as possible we went into another house in St Giles s and there found the boy Henry Palmerston we took him to the Round-house and Davis said he could tell us where two of the rings were we went and Davis got in at a window and brought out two rings which were delivered to me John Simmonds was in bed with a girl in one room and as we were breaking open the door he jumped out at the window naked as he was Davis said this is Simmonds and the girl acknowledged it was so we carried his cloaths to the Round-house I was informed two or three days afterwards that he was in custody Till was in prison before Millar came to me We went in pursuit of them to several houses and took Simmonds three or four days afterwards then I was sent for and bound over to prosecute There was a chimney-sweeper said he saw two of the rings in Till s possession Mr Welch bound him over as an evidence and he ran away but I am told is since taken up for another robbery Millar delivered up several of the clasps that he had in his own custody and Davis gave me two gold rings I can swear to the clasps and I think I could swear to the rings but rings are so much alike that I would not chuse to swear to them here is my workman s mark on them Q from Davis He says I had two gold rings Whether I had or no Fisher He said I can tell you where two gold rings are he took me to the house where they were I think they said they took down a lath out of the cicling to get at them John Millar William Daniel William Lebat and myself were pulling Mr Fisher s shew-glass out while we were doing this up came John Simmonds William Davis Harry Palmerston Thomas Erkenn which we call Tom the footman and William Till they seeing what we were doing they stayed and helped us I lifted up the shew-glass and took out the box with clasps and buttons William Till came behind me put his hand in and took out a card of Mocho buttons I went and laid the box down by the iron bars and came back and saw them very busy I went back to the box and took the buttons out of the box and put them in my pocket When I came back again Tom the footman was taking the rings out of the shew-glass and Simmonds was holding the thing up when they had got the rings they run off as hard as they could they ran against a woman and dropped one or two of the rings which I heard was found that night I took Lebat and Daniel who are not yet taken into my room and we shared the buttons and studs equally together they went both away The next morning I went to the Coach-yard St Giles s the

offered two of the rings for Half a Crown which I gave him for them we had each two rings apiece and then there were four that could not be divided because there were five in the gang so we agreed to sell them and divide the money Davis went to sell them and he happened to shew the brass ring to a woman who he told us lived in Thieving-lane and she said Don t make a fool of me that have made fools of thousands he offered to shew her the others but she would not see them I went away and gave the rings to my wife to sell she got 7 s 6 d for them I also gave her the studs and buttons she got for some 2 s 6 d for some 2 s and for some 18 d not knowing they were stolen The robbery was done on Saturday night between the hours of nine and ten and on the Tuesday I made the discovery to Mr Fisher

and get my bread honestly that was my only reason Q Did you never see these people after that morning you was with them at the Coach-yard Millar No I did not till they came into my room Q As it was

the money that the lace and cat-gut came to which I believe was 7 1/2 d seeing all these operations confirmed me very strongly in my suspicion that she had got a card of lace she said then is that the lowest price I said yes then she said I shall want a dozen and eight yards of lace which I must send my young woman for to-morrow morning then she wished me a good afternoon and away she went the went to the door I went found the counter catched hold of her hand and said I wanted to speak to her Q Where was she then Gunston There is a sash door she had got on the outside of the door and was just turning round to go as soon as she came in I said Ma am you have got a card of lace or something that don t belong to you she denied it I then took her into the back counting-house and charged her with it again Q Was there any people in the shop besides Gunston Mr Green was serving two ladies she immediately fell down upon her knees and begged for God s sake I would have mercy upon her I desired her to sit down in a chair she refused and fell down directly upon her knees again and made a motion by which I thought she wanted to disengage what she had I then pulled her up rather rough and pushed her down into a chair to make her sit down I then put her apron and gown by and she first thing I saw sticking out under her stays was this piece of gauze producing it Court That has nothing to do in this case Gunston Then I felt under her stays and pulled out this card of lace producing it Q Do you know it to be Mr Green s Gunston Yes very well for that very morning I took it on return from a milliner that had it the night before to shew to a lady she begged still very hard for God s sake I would forgive her and let her go and she pulled a little box out of her pocket which she opened and threw about eight or ten pieces of gold upon the table which she begged I would accept if I would keep this affair secret which I would not do I then secured her Mr Green came back into the counting house and asked her name she said it was Shipley and that her husband was an attorney in St Mary Axe Mr Green went back into the shop and brought two ladies with him while Mr Green was gone I said what could be your motive for doing this she said poverty said I that is impossible you have gold here in plenty you do not seem as if you was in any distress you do not know said she what distress there is in a family almost directly she clasped me round the body and said I am not a married woman for God s sake make it up and I will give you twenty guineas if you will make it up Court Well well you need not mention every little circumstance you charged a constable with her Gunston By this time the ladies came into the counting-house where we were and Mr Green asked them if they knew her they said yes and were sorry to see her under these circumstances Mrs Tonge said Ma am you do not know me she said yes and her name was Tonge and that she lived in Fleet-street Mr Green said how could you tell me such a falsity she said Lord Sir would you have me tell the truth at this time I was sent for a constable Q Is there any mark upon the lace Gunston Yes the number of the card and a private mark of what it cost us it is Mr Green s marking I know it to be his property Cross Examination Q You say she came into your shop to buy lace and did buy it Gunston Yes Q That she had a parcel like that you describe Gunston Yes Q When you saw her lay it upon the card of lace did you attempt to take it off or speak to her about any impropriety you observed in it Gunston I had no reason nor no right to do it Q When you wanted to lift the counter in order to see under it she removed it Gunston Yes Q And there was something particular in it but you saw nothing under the parcel itself Gunston No Q Not saw nothing of the lace till the time you mentioned you took it from under her stays Gunston Yes Q Have you always talked the same of this story as you do now Gunston Yes Q Or did you say before the sitting alderman that when she moved it across the counter you saw part of the lace hang down Gunston I did not sir because the card was pinn d up Q When the lace is taken from a card do you put other lace upon the same card Gunston If it is the same pattern if not we destroy the old mark and put another on again it would be very extravagant else to use a card to every lace Q You do not know when that was marked Gunston No Q It may have been marked a great while before for any thing you know Gunston It was marked when that lace was put upon the card Court What is the reason for your saying it was marked when the lace was put on Gunston When we have a card that has been used before we cut off the old mark and mark it afresh with what that cost Q Nor you do not know them to be your own cards Gunston Yes Court It is by the mark you know what to ask Gunston Yes it is marked with the prime cost and we know what profit to ask Counsel When you sell a whole card you sell card and all Gunston Sometimes we sell it card and all sometimes not Q How high is the box it was in Gunston It is a drawer it might be four or five inches deep Q You say you laid the laces when you took them out upon that side of the drawer farthest from her Gunston Yes Q You put it over the drawer next you Gunston Yes a cross the drawer and covered the laces with it Prisoner s Defence The card of lace I certainly took up with my parcel I had my gloves on and upon my word I knew no more that I had it then you do it never was under my stays so help me God Court How many yards was upon this piece Gunston Seventeen yards it cost Mr Green 8 d the yard it cost him 11 s 4 d Counsel for the prisoner I thought you asked her 4 s a dozen Gunston That was a narrow edging she was bargaining for not for this Court Was you not satisfied by what you saw the woman do that she had stole the lace Gunston Yes every circumstance confirmed my suspicion Court I do not mean whether it gave rise to a suspicion but was you convinced in your mind Gunston I was convinced in my mind she had got something but I did not know what For the Prisoner Henry Parker I am a gauze weaver I have known her about a year or more Q What character does she bear Parker I know nothing of her character Q She has dealt with you Parker Yes Q Very honestly Parker I never suspected the contrary John Burcher I am a goldsmith in Long-acre I have known her ever since 1761 great part of the time she has kept a milliner s shop in Fleet-street she is in a large way of business I never heard but that she dealt fairly and honestly and bore the character of an honest woman Mrs Burcher I have known her between 13 and 14 years I thought her character a very good one I keep a shop with my son she had a house of mine two or three years before she went into business she paid very honestly I have bought things of her cloaks and every thing this is a litigious thing I do not think she would be guilty of such a thing Court I cannot pass by such evidence as this without taking notice of it have you heard what Gunston swore that he took this piece of lace from under her stays Burcher Yes Court Well and can you think that owing to a mistake Burcher We have had many mistakes in my shop and ladies have carried things into their coach Q What under their stays Burcher In their laps some how Court Now suppose a fine lady was to come into your shop and you should miss some jewels and find them afterwards half way down their stays would you think that a mistake Burcher We have found this mistake and taken them out Q Do you upon your oath believe supposing that gentleman has swore true that this was a mistake Burcher I know nothing of that gentleman I am sure it amazed me Q Why then do you put such a construction upon it Burcher I do not think she would have been guilty of such a thing Charles Barnet I live at Wendover in Bucks I am a lace-maker I have known her seven or eight years I have dealt with her from that time her general character always was very good till this Q Did she always bear the character of an honest woman Barnet She did to me Q You live at Wendover Barnet Yes but I come to London every week or fortnight I never thought any thing amiss of her Q Have you left lace at her house Barnet Yes while I have been going to take a walk with any friend I have left from 50 l to 200 l worth of lace at a time as I might at any other shop where I dealt Q Were they sealed Barnet No only tied or buckled with a strap I never lost a card to my knowledge I have when I have been ill sent her up a dozen or so and she has sent me down the money for a card I never missed a yard of those cards that I left with her I would have opened an account with her but she would not suffer me to do it Michael Patterson I live at No 5 in Wood-street I am in partnership with Sherwood and Reynolds we keep a Coventry ribbon ware-house Q How long have you known her Patterson About two or three years she has come and looked out goods we have sent them she has always paid for every thing she had I never had any suspicion of her honesty Q What is her general character Patterson I never heard any thing to the contrary Edward Sumpter I am a broker upon Snow-hill I have known her four or five years I never knew any thing but what was very good I never heard any thing against her character before William Bowler I am a lace-man I live at Radcliffe-cross I did live in Oxfordshire I have known her five or six years I never heard any thing amiss of her character before this I dealt with her for hundreds of pounds I have left cards of lace with her time after time I always received them as I left them Joseph Witbridge I live in Fleet-street I am a silk morcer I have known her four or five years Q What is her general character Witbridge I have not heard much of it she has dealt with me and always paid me honestly I have not dealt with her this twelve-month past as I know of Eleanor Ellway I am a milliner I lived three years with her I left her eleven months ago Q What is her general character Ellway She was always in a just way of dealing Q Did she bear the character of an honest woman Ellway I never heard any imputation upon her character William Hern I am an attorney I have known her a dozen years I never knew any thing amiss of her in my life My father used to invite her for weeks together to our house before she kept this shop she has generally a very good character Edward Bryan I was present at the examination of Mrs Tonge at Guildhall Mr Gunston said when she took up the lace she put her hand under the parcel and he said he saw the corner of the lace and the corner of the card stick out the card was his word Nebemiab Ward I understood it in the same light upon the examination as the last witness has given his oath that in taking up the parcel he said he saw the lace or the corner of the lace I understood him so Q The other said the corner of the card Ward He said he saw the corner of the lace hang down Court You are coming here upon words that is the whole to shew that this gentleman said at the Lord Mayor s different from what he has now said now can you recollect the words he made use of Ward As nigh as I can recollect he made use of the expression of the corner of the card being seen under the parcel he took up the paper and said he saw the corner of it hang down or out Q Was that the word Ward I believe it is Q Are you sure he said the corner of it Ward I am partly sure that is the word Court to Mr Gunston Do you recollect what you said Gunston Yes I do it did not come into my mind when I was upon my evidence I said before Alderman Sawbridge that in order to be certain after the stiff moving of the parcel I did endeavour to see if I could discover any thing under it I put my head low down and thought I discovered the corner of the card but saw no lace Q Is your master here Gunston No he is a quaker therefore I was bound over to prosecute Q Are any of those ladies here Gunston I thought there was no necessity of their coming here they saw nothing of the transaction but only spoke about her person Guilty of stealing the lace but not privately in the shop T 2d L SARAH the wife of Stancey TONGE otherwise Thomas Tonge was a second time indicted for stealing six yards of gauze value 10 s the property of Jarvis Chambers and Stephen Langston privately in their shop March 30th + - Holyer I am an apprentice to Messrs Jarvis Chambers and Stephen Langston they are haberdashers in Cheapside Q Do you remember the prisoner coming to their shop Holyer Yes on Tuesday the 30th of March at near five in the afternoon Q Had you ever seen her before Holyer Not to my knowledge Q Are you sure to her person Holyer Yes she asked me for an article called glossy cat-gut I shewed her some she bought one yard to the best of my remembrance at 20 d and paid for it in the same paper of cat-gut was contained a piece of gauze like this Q From whom had you that piece Holyer William Gunston he delivered it to me just this minute Q Are you sure that piece is your master s property Holyer There was such a piece in the paper Q Can you be sure was there your mark upon it Holyer There was no mark upon it there was such a piece in the paper when I opened it to her I immediately put the paper up in its place as she was going out of the shop with the remainder of the cat-gut in it I did not observe whether the gauze was gone or not she went away The next I heard of it was William Gunston sent to our shop to know whether we had lost such a thing Q How far is Mr Green s from your shop Holyer Nine doors I went immediately into Mr Green s without looking at the paper when the piece of gauze was shewn me by Gunston the prisoner was present we sent one of our young men to the house for the paper I sent Samuel Raymes for the paper he brought it back we had no other paper of the kind in the shop Q How long was it before he brought it Holyer Three minutes at the farthest when it was brought we opened it and there was the cat-gut in it but the piece of gauze like this was not there The prisoner confessed the fact she said she had taken it from our house Q Did she say any thing more Holyer She wanted much to be released she begged very hard Q Did she speak to you Holyer Yes Q What was the purport of what she said Holyer To let her go off free without charging her with a constable she offered Jarvis Chambers who was then present - Q He was not there at first Holyer No Q Was he present when she confessed she stole it from your shop Holyer He came of his own accord upon hearing we were there she asked for pen ink and paper that she might assign over to him what was in her possession at that time as a grataity to let her go Q What did you understand by it Holyer I apprehended she meant all her effects Q She did beg to be discharg d did she Holyer She kneeled down on her knees several times Prisoner Knowing there were ladies waiting for me at home I begged to be let go Q Did she say any thing to you of having ladies at home Holyer Yes she said she was wanted at home Q And begged you would let her go Holyer Yes Q How came she to tell you she had taken it at your house Holyer We charged her with it and she confessed it Prisoner It was my own gauze I never confessed it I had used seven yards of it it was my own Cross Examination Q What became of the gauze afterwards Holyer It was left in William Gunston s possession Q Who produces it now Holyer I do Q Have you ever seen the gauze since Holyer No I saw it when it was brought to find the bill of indictment Q Was there ever any charge made of this gauze before the alderman Holyer I did not appear before the alderman Q Then from that time to this there has been no charge against this woman till this bill of indictment how came you not to go to the alderman to charge her with this Holyer Because Gunston went with his lace Q Who applied to you to prosecute her for stealing the gauze Holyer My master desired me Q Who applied to your master Holyer Nobody Q Then it is extraordinary you did not go before the alderman Holyer Gunston was enough for that Q Did not she deny the gauze being your s Holyer At first afterwards she confessed it Q That is you are pleased to say she confessed it Holyer I am pleased to say the truth William Gunston I took her into the back room behind the shop in order to search her when I got her into the chair I put her apron and gown by the first thing I saw was this gauze sticking about the middle part under her stays and held between the stays and her body I pulled it out and said hollow what have you got here she said this is some gauze I am going to shew to a lady said I this is an odd manner to take gauze to shew to ladies under your stays I am afraid you have taken it somewhere or other she then said it was her own gauze I opened a little parcel in her hand to see what she had been buying and in it I saw some glossy cat-gut I then called for our apprentice and bid him go into the neighbourhood and enquire who had sold a lady that cat-gut he went to two of the neighbours and they had not sold any then he went to Mr Langstone s and then Mr Holyer and Mr Addington both came up I said Mr Holyer do you know this piece of gauze he said no we had such a piece of gauze in the parcel I will go home and fetch it Q Did you shew the piece of gauze to Holyer Gunston Yes I forget whether Addington and he both went or how but Addington brought the parcel soon after Holyer said before the parcel was opened if there is a piece of Paris net in this parcel this is not our s the parcel was opened and the Paris net was not there there was none Cross Examination Q Is this that gauze or Paris net Gunston Paris net gauze that is the term of it Q It does not seem to be rumpled Gunston I have kept it in a box in my custody from that hour to this Q One would have apprehended if a woman had had it under her stays it would have been tumbled how far up was it Gunston About thus high describing it to be about half way up her stays that gauze will not rumple Q to Holyer How long had she been gone from your shop before you was sent for Holyer About ten minutes Q from the Jury to Gunston What reason had you to send to Messrs Langstone and Chambers s before any other shop Court He told you he sent to two or three others before Samuel Addington Mr Green s young man came into our shop and asked me whether there had been a lady at our house within a few minutes to buy some glossy cat-gut I said yes he said come to our house to look at her for we have found some Paris net upon her which we imagine is stole from somebody I went immediately and Holyer followed and I went home for this paper when I came to see the lady at Mr Green s they asked me was this lady in your shop I said yes Holyer was there at the time Q Who sent you home for the paper Addington Gunston I believe or whether I said I will fetch the paper I cannot hardly recollect but I went home and fetched the paper immediately Q Did you know the paper Addington Very well Q Did you ever see that gauze in that paper Addington We always keep that sort of gauze and glossy cat-gut and plain gauze in that paper either Mr Gunston desired me or I said will fetch the paper I forget which Q You know perfectly well the paper Addington Yes every thing of the glossy kind was put in that paper Q Did Holyer say any thing about the paper Addington I cannot recollect whether he did or no for I immediately ran for it as soon as ever I saw the prisoner Q Did you open it at your own shop Addington No not till I got to Mr Green s compting-house there I found in it glossy cat-guts and plain gauze she offered any sum of money and called for pen and ink to make over all that she had in the world if Mr Green and Mr Langstone the owners of the lace and gauze would not prosecute her Cross Examination Q You have said all the glossy gauze and cat-gut was in that paper Addington Yes Q Was that all the gauze you had in the house Addington No we keep variety of gauzes in the house all the glossy gauze that we have we keep there Q Is it gauze or Paris net Addington It is Paris net gauze Court Is this a kind of gauze Addington Yes there is plain gauze and figured gauze of various denominations but this we always call Paris net Q But is it gauze Addington Yes Prisoner I told Mr Gunston it was my own when he took it barbarously from me he never charged me with it before the alderman Q from the prisoner s counsel to Gunston Did not she tell you it was her own gauze Gunston She said so at first Q How came she not to be charged with this before the alderman Gunston I only charged her there with the affair of the lace Q Nothing was mentioned then before the alderman but about the lace Gunston Yes I did mention it before the alderman but he said that was nothing to this Q Had she any gauze of her own Gunston She had a little parcel she bought at Mr Langstone s I returned it before the alderman and what she bought of me Prisoner Mr Gunston wanted to keep it all from me but the alderman obliged him to give it me back for that part is my property Court to Holyer After that woman had been in the shop did you shew any of the glossy gauze or any thing in that paper to any other customer Holyer No the paper was not opened from the time she was in the shop till it was opened in Mr Green s compting-house Court to Addington Was you in the shop Addington Yes from the whole time the prisoner was at our house till I went to Mr Green s and I am certain it was never opened from the time it was shewn her till I carried it to Mr Green s Q How long was it after you went from your shop to Mr Green s before you came back Addington Not a minute I ran there and back directly and it is very near Prisoner s Defence It is my own property they took it from me Mr Gunston has a particular spite towards me and I believe there are people in court that he should say to that if it was possible he would have my life I have witnesses to prove that one is a servant maid her mistress was uneasy about me she was surprised as all the world must about a woman of my reputation I might have been trusted with thousands In regard to this woman she is only a servant maid that has lived with a lady I have worked for many years she was frightened with the news and sent her servant to Mr Gunston s to buy pins and know the truth of it and he was pleased to say desperate things of what he would do to me Mr Sumpter has heard something of it Counsel for the Prisoner I do not think that is very material we had better rely upon her good character Court As the woman has stated this to the jury you should either retract it or endeavour to prove it Counsel for the Prisoner Then my lord we will ask Mr Gunston Q to Gunston Have you declared at any time that you would hang her if it was in your power Gunston To the best of my knowledge I never said such a thing I might have said she deserved the full of the law as being an old offender and well known in the trade Q What did you say about hanging her cost what it would Gunston I do not know Q Did you say that if she got off one indictment you would hang her upon the other Gunston No Q Not to that effect Gunston No I have said that as being an old offender in the trade I was afraid if lenity was shewn to her and that if the affair was only laid for transportation she would get at large I said if it is laid capital she may get off for transportation that she may get out of the kingdom For I cast one in this court once and she obtained a pardon and a week after she came to the door and abused me For the Prisoner Henry Parker I am a gauze weaver she has dealt with me four five or six years I have known her so long I always thought her an honest woman John Burchall I have known her ever since the year sixty-one she has an extraordinary good character I know nothing amiss of her Sarah Burchall I have known her 13 or 14 years I never heard any harm of her before she is a milliner she lived in a house of mine as I told you before and paid her rent very well I never knew her guilty of any thing I always looked upon her as a very honest woman I thought her the most industrious creature I ever knew I would deal with her again if she was discharged Court Then you are more confirmed in your good opinion of her this afternoon than you was in the morning Burchall It was my intention of saying it then Q What now you have heard her convicted upon a former indictment Burchall No it was my intention to say it then Charles Barnard I am a laceman in Buckinghamshire I come to town very frequently I have dealt with

some shirt buckles I took out a drawer which contained buckles and rings he looked over the shirt buckles and shook them about I suspected from his manner he had some other purpose than to buy at last he agreed for a shirt buckle then he asked to look at some silver buckles he agreed for a pair of them when he had done he put his hand into his pocket and said he had not money enough to pay for them and he asked his two campanions to lend him the money they each said they had not money enough then he asked me to send the maid with them and his father would advance the money I sent the maid with them when she was gone I missed a ring I had not recollection enough of the ring that was missing to know what sort of a ring it was but I could see plainly there was a ring missing I recollected that

Bedford-street and kept me there about half an hour then he asked me if Stewart had got the buckles for if he had he might probably make off with them that he did not know much of him he had only been at sea with him then the third person came to the public house and said it was to no purpose to wait any longer for Steward for he believed his father was angry with him for pretending to lay out so much money and I might as well go home I went home and then I heard that a ring was missing The ring produced in court by Timothy Barker the pawn-broker Charles Rapley I am a workman and able to speak to the work of the ring I have examined it and am confident it is my ring Mary Rapley I am sure it is our ring Barker This ring was brought to me on the 27th in the forenoon by Stewart and offered to pledge I told him I had some reason to think it belonged to a jeweller in St Martin s Court and he must stay till I could send there he said he would stay there were several people in the shop

mounting the horse I went up to him and said he must not go he must go with me to St Martin s Court upon which he disengaged himself from the horse and instantly ran away I pursued him and after some time overtook him and brought him back I talked of carrying him immediately before Sir John Fielding but he desired first to go to St Martin s Court Mrs Rapley said as soon as she saw him that he was the man and that was her ring Question from Stewart Whether I had not told you I had the ring of a man at the door Barker I do not recollect any suchthing the prisoner said that he was the finisher of the ring Stewart Whether I did not tell you the man on horseback was the man that had sent me with the ring and desired you to stop him Barker He did not do that Stewart s Defence I took nothing out of the shop I met a man at the Lemon-tree in the Haymarket he owed me a little money I asked him for the money he said he had nothing but a which if I would pledge he would pay me and I bid the

No other way Sir I ascertained the name I have had that watch in my possession about three weeks or a month Court In that time you have sold several watches - Yes but I did not mean to sell that in the state it was I meant to chase it or to engrave it I am perfectly sure to the watch I am perfectly sure I had not sold it Court Is there any body that sells for you besides yourself - Nobody I always examine all my watches in the morning when I go out Court Yes but you was not able to ascertain which watch it was till you examined your book - I was clear in my own opinion that a watch was taken from off that pin and there was no other missing but that I am perfectly clear there had been a watch on that pin I knew the watch immediately there was one of my papers in it which was the cause of Mr Heather so readily sending to me I know nothing of the prisoner I never saw him till I saw him before the Justice Mr Sylvester Prisoner s Council Your watches were hanging as all watches are - Yes in the window You know it is usual when people come into a shop to take down sometimes one watch and sometimes another - Certainly Now your son sometimes moves a watch - No he is particularly ordered never to move them That is another thing he is but a boy boys do not always do as they are bid - No I believe they do not I am sure they do not Whether the watch had been moved by any body when you was in the shop you cannot tell - O then I am sure nobody moved it Why - Because I do not suffer any body to touch the watches but myself No why but if I was to come into your shop - If you was a stranger I certainly should not permit you to do it I should say Sir if you will give me leave to take it off for sometimes the watches stick Yes but from a man s appearance you would be cautious of saying a rude thing - Certainly Sir Then you do not know from your own knowledge how the watch got out of your custody at all - I have said it Sir JOHN HEATHER sworn On Wednesday the 17th of September about four or five in the afternoon the prisoner brought this watch to pledge with me he wanted a guinea and a half on the watch seeing him a Black I opened the watch and perceiving it was gold I asked him what he gave for it he said he gave two guineas and a half for it I knowing he could not purchase it for that stopped him and took him to the Public Office in Bow-street and he was committed on the Friday a very humane good lady whom the Black had lived with and in whose family he and five other brothers were born promised him if he would tell the truth where he got the watch she would do all that she could for him in consequence of the lady s promise he said at the Royal Exchange but I do not believe he knew the house he was never out of custody after that I have no doubt of the identity of the man The watch deposed to Mr Sylvester My Lord I submit to your Lordship that this is evidence arising from the man s own confession and it is in consequence of promised favor to him he discovered where he had the watch from in consequence of that discovery the prosecutor is found out Court to Heather Was there a paper of Mr Storr s in the watch - After he said he took it from the Royal Exchange then I guessed seeing Mr Storr s name in the inside I then thought it was Mr Storr s Court to Mr Sylvester I do not conceive the rule of law with respect to confessions made upon promises to extend to all facts connected with those confessions if it did it would shut out all evidence but it only shuts out the confession being given in evidence Mr Justice Nares The objection you made I think is such as ought always to be made where faith is given and where a poor man depends upon promises made where he makes discoveries by which his life may be taken away but I think this case stands abstracted from that for here is a watch lost by Storr here is a watch brought by the prisoner to Heather and by him taken from the prisoner and abstracted from any thing else there is evidence enough to go to the jury because Storr says that is his watch that he lost between three and five and this was the watch that was offered to be pawned between four and five the same day Mr Recorder The evidence in this case derives no advantage from the confession whatever we do not know that the prisoner made any confession Mr Justice Nares to Heather Who was the lady that appeared - One Mrs Weale the Rev Dr Weale s lady Court to Storr What age is your boy - Between nine and ten How old are you little boy - Nine years and four months Have you learned your catechism - Yes Have you ever heard the nature of an oath upon the Bible - Yes Do you know the consequence of speaking falsely and telling a lye afterwards - Going to the Devil And do you know you are liable to be punished here if you speak an untruth - Yes SWORN Court What happened after your father left you at home in the shop did any body come in - Yes that Black You do not know him - I knew the Black again Did you see the man take the watch off the hook - No Sir Did you see him about the hook - No I only saw him sit down by the desk he sat down and he said he came from a Captain to speak to my father to take me on board a ship How long did he stay in the shop - He staid about half an hour he came once before that then he called about half an hour after and said he must stay to speak to my father I cannot say I saw him take it You think that was the person that came into the shop - Yes I am sure it is Prisoner s Council How came you not to tell your father of it - I did not recollect him then I did not recollect that any body had been in No why when did your father come in - I suppose my father came in about five o clock What o clock was the Black there - First at three and then half an hour after Did not you recollect either of the times - No Now was it not because you was affraid to let your father know the watch was stolen - No Sir You see your father questioned you two or three times very minutely and at last you told him was not it because you saw it go and was affraid to tell him - I did not see it go My dear boy what was you affraid of - Nothing at all Why did not you tell him - Because I did not recollect it Jury Had you any suspicion that any thing was stolen at all - None at all PRISONER s DEFENCE I know nothing of it I do not know where the boy lives I never said that I took the watch I never stole any thing in my life Can you give any account how you came by this watch - I met a man and bought it of him FRANCES WEALE sworn I have known the prisoner sixteen years his general character is a very good one he was a slave to my father in the West-Indies the whole family of them belonged to me he bore a good character during that time he lived with me some part of the time Mr Justice Nares This prisoner was with me a year or more and I never saw any thing amiss of him but childish tricks he was quite a child not above nine years old and he went over from me I returned him to that lady who had a great regard for the family I thought it was much better to let him go home again Court to Mrs Weale Has he been with any body abroad lately - He came to England last year in a Merchant s ship he was discharged Court to Jury Gentlemen in the first place it is but justice to observe that nobody in the City of London carries on that critical business of a pawnbroker with more caution or in a better manner than Mr Heather for I have seen many instances where his conduct has been the means of detecting prisoners As to this case in what manner the prisoner stole this wat ch is not so precisely proved upon that therefore you may exercise your judgment if you can rely on the evidence of the boy then the whole matter is proved otherwise if you think that circumstance is not sufficiently proved and you are satisfied that he is the person that stole the watch without being able to declare in what manner he stole it then you may acquit him of the capital part of the charge GUILTY Of stealing but not privately Transported to the West-Indies for seven years Mr Justice Nares It is not to be understood that we mean to cast any aspersion upon this little child Court It is very natural that the child should be affraid having disobeyed his father s orders but that takes away the full reliance on his evidence Tried by the first London Jury before Mr RECORDER

Twenty or thirty she went out and I followed her I did not stop to see whether she had taken the cotton or not she went into the silk-dyer s I ran back immediately it was about four doors from us I went after her again she was gone from the silk-dyer s and when I came back to our shop I found her just returned and buying some muslin she wanted to pay for it and seemed rather confused as I thought at least I then looked the cottons over again and examined them and was quite positive that it was gone she wanted to pay for that piece that she had fixed on I told Mr Broome what I had suspected she paid for the muslin and as she went out I stopped her she said she knew nothing of it nor of the other woman only as a slight acquaintance we told her then if she would confess and tell us where it was so that we might have our linen again we should trouble ourselves nothing about it we repeated it several times she offered to be searched she positively denied it we then sent for a constable it was near half an hour before we could fine one she then said - Mr Garrow I am again obliged to trouble your Lordship whether you would hear what the woman said this evidence confirms his master that first of all there was an attempt to get at some confession from her by promising her that if she would tell where the goods were she should not be hurt then upon her still persisting they have recourse to the other implement by which confessions are extorted namely threats now I submit to your Lordship that upon either of these grounds the evidence is not admissible In a very late case I took this objection and the Court held without a doubt that the evidence under these circumstances was not admissible the man was tried for robbing Messrs Prescot and Grotes of a Bank post-bill the defendant told a story to which the witness said that is very unsatisfactory And unless you tell me a more satisfactory story I shall send for a constable under those circumstances and under the terror of that threat the prisoner made a very ample confession the witness was going to disclose that confession I took the objection and the Court held most clearly without the smallest doubt that it could not be received for that that engine had been employed as in this case with this addition in this case that this woman was acting under the same impression from the beginning and therefore I submit with the greatest deference to the Court as I cannot in my mind separate the two impressions that were made on the mind of that woman that the Court in a case of life will not suffer this confession to be received Court I think we cannot receive this confession but any acts that were done afterwards may be received in evidence Mr Justice Buller Whatever acts are done are evidence but if those acts are not sufficient to make out the caseagainst the prisoner you are not to hear her conversation or confession so as to couple it with those acts I tried a prisoner where the evidence was just as it is here and I stopped all the witnesses when they came to the confession the prisoner was acquitted there were two learned Judges on the bench who told me that though what the prisoner said was not evidence any facts that arose afterwards must be received and tho that did not affect the case of the prisoner then at the bar it was stated afterwards to all the Judges and that was the line drawn though you will not receive the confession or declarations of prisoners made under such impressions yet the acts done afterwards may be received Court to Barber Was any thing done subsequent to this did you go and find this printed cotton any where - Yes I found it at the chandler s shop in James-street Hay-market The cotton produced and deposed to by the shop mark Court Was that linen amongst the parcel of linen you shewed the prisoner - Yes You are sure of it - Yes Mr Garrow There was a woman in the shop before these women came in - Yes How long had the first woman been gone before Hyde went out of the shop - About ten minutes Had you after that woman went away observed that identical piece of linen there - Yes Why you have told my Lord that there were thirty pieces of linen - This was at the bottom I can swear it positively they were dark linens I shewed her and this was a very light one Did you observe that identical piece of linen - Yes You mean to swear that - Yes Were these 30 whole pieces or remnants - Some whole pieces and some remnants What is the distance of this chandler s shop - About two hundred yards The first woman might have carried it to the chandler s shop herself - This piece was not taken down till after the other woman went out of the shop Why they were laying on the compter - No that I remember I wish you would remember this that this is a case that affects the lives of two prisoners by your evidence Mr Barber - There were several things laying on the counter Aye so many things that you could not then distinguish the one from the other though you now affect to say that you could distinguish - I can take my oath that I saw her hand on it taking it from the rest I am sure I saw her hand on it And on that identical piece - Yes I can swear that the others were all dark You did not follow this woman into the chandler s shop - No You did not interrupt her in her walk to the silk dyer s - No You took a traverse through a number of other streets and then found the woman in the shop - Yes And she told the other woman to stay there - Yes I told her that I supposed she must have given it to the other woman ELIZABETH LINDSEY sworn I live in James-street Hay-market I keep a chandler s shop on the 19th the prisoner Hyde came into our shop for a quartern of starch and asked to leave that bundle and she would call for it I let her leave the bundle I do not know what it contained Court Was it the same bundle that you afterwards delivered to the young man Barber - Yes I believe it was Did you give it to Barber - I gave it to the prisoner again Mr Garrow You never had seen her before - No She was not a minute in your shop - No Court Are you sure it was the prisoner at the bar - I believe it to be the same I took my oath so Had you any conversation with the prisoner at all - No I know she was the same that delivered the bundle to me FOR THE PRISONER HYDE - SELBY Esq sworn I am Clerk of the Peace for the County of Middlesex I know the prisoner Eleanor Hyde I have know her ever since she was a girl she was born at Alnwick I knew her family very well I never heard any thing against her I always looked upon her as an honest woman she has been in town something about a year I have never seen her since she was in London I understood she was lately married I have seen her husband and was very much surprized when I heard of this matter Court What way of life was her husband in - A servant I believe Court Has the prisoner any other witnesses to her character Mr Garrow My Lord after Mr Selby s evidence I shall not trouble your Lordship with any more witnesses to her character Jury My Lord the Jury wish to be informed whether a suspicion of the witness that she took the cotton at that time takes off the private stealing Court He did not see her take it but he saw her attempting to take it and in all probability it was taken at that time there is sufficient foundation on the evidence to think that it was Mr Justice Buller He immediately afterwards saw her apply to the other for a handkerchief if she took it at that time it was not a stealing privately if you could suppose she did not take it then but took it afterwards when his back was turned that would be a stealing privately Mr Baron Perryn He was put on his guard and wherever there is a doubt of that kind one would always incline to the milder part of the case DOROTHY MOXEY NOT GUILTY ELEANOR HYDE GUILTY Of stealing but not privately Transported for seven years Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr Baron PERRYN

perceived there were only five seals though I had taken out six the two prisoners kept close together but Smith generally stood with his back to the counter which gave him a command of the other side of the shop where Mrs Parker and Mrs Janaway were behind the counter I told Mr Janaway who just then came into the shop and that they had stole the seals he went out and brought them back in two or

said it could Smith proposed that Mr Janaway should let him and the other prisoner go and Hilliard to make himself answerable for the return of the seal to Mr Janaway Mr Hilliard said that was impossible as he had never seen the seal nor did he know it the coach stopped at the Compter door but instead of going in Carr desired it might drive to the Cape Coast Castle in Leadenhall-street but Hillard said that was so bad a house that he would not go there and I think Hilliard mentioned some house in Lombard-street the coach went on to the publick-house in Leadenhall-street there Hilliard and Carr got out for the purpose of fetching the seal leaving Smith with us they came back in about ten minutes Hilliard said he knew the person that had got the seal it was one Garland two other men returned to the coach with Hilliard and Carr one of them whose name is Polock offered to do anything to assist Carr Polock was desired by Carr to go to the Half Moon in Aldersgate-street to see Garland and to tell him to stop there till we come the coach was then ordered to Aldersgate-street as we were going to Jewin-street it stopped without any orders from withinside Polock and the other man that we had seen in Leadenhall-street first came up to the coach window as it drew up to the pavement they did not come close to the window they stood opposite with their backs against the houses they were instantly joined by Garland that was the first time I ever saw him he looked into the coach and then withdrew behind the back pannel of the coach I was sitting with my face to the horses so that I in consequence lost sight of him at the very instant of his withdrawing almost a glove was put into the coach by a hand which came from the part to which he had withdrawn I could see nothing but the hand the glove was given into the hand of Carr and in it I saw Carr take out of the glove the gold seal it was not put in the glove but wrapped in it I wished to see Garland again and I looked through the little round window behind the coach and I saw him coming from behind the coach to the other side of the way Are you positive then that Garland is the man that delivered in the glove at the coach window - Quite positive No doubt about it - Not the least in the world As the coach was drawing up Hilliard sat next to the pavement and he said here comes Garland with the seal the prisoners wished to be released Mr Janaway said he could not think of doing that he should commit them and put them under the jurisdiction of the Lord Mayor I have the seal it has been in my possession ever since produced and deposed to I am sure that was the sixth seal which Carr approved off it has been in the house I should suppose six years I have repeatedly brushed it Mr Leach counsel for prisoner Smith What time of day was it - Between three and four Smith never appeared in the character of a purchaser - Not at all JOHN JANAWAY sworn I am in partnership with Mr Wetherall I saw six seals on the counter and my man said Sir they have got a seal Carr and Smith were standing near but Lacey was standing with his back to the other seeming to me to wish to divert our attention from Carr I pursued them and told them they had taken a seal and insisted on their coming back they had turned up the passage to the market they totally denied it both of them I sent for the constable I had them both searched nothing was found upon them Lacey that is Smith was the first person that called me aside he asked me if the seal was produced whether all would stop I told him I would have no private negotiation whatever with him and immediately withdrew from him they offered to pay any money for the seal and pressed me very much to take the money for the seal I said if you would give me a thousand guineas I will not take it they both of them made me that offer but Lacey was more solicitous than Carr I think it was Smith that proposed the seal should be forth coming in half an hour after some conversation Hilliard said can the seal be produced and Carr said it could and if they would drive to the sign of the Cape Coast Castle he would get the seal but Hilliard said it was an infamous house and my life would be in danger and they would not permit me to go then they drove to another house in Leadenhall-street and Hilliard and Carr got out and when they returned Hilliard said I know who has the seal a man of the name of Garland two men were standing at the door of this publick-house one named Polock who is here Carr desired Polock to go to the house in Aldersgate-street where he would find Garland and to tell him to stop there till the coach came there going down Jewin-street the coach suddenly stopped not by any orders from us and immediately I saw two men come up Polock and another man Hilliard said as the coach was stopping here comes Garland with the seal then I saw Garland come up he went to the back part of the coach and presently there came a hand into the coach with a glove but whose hand it was I cannot say that glove contained the seal the prisoners were taken to the Compter Garland was apprehended by order of the Lord Mayor the next day but one it is our seal the property of myself and partner I have had it five or six years it is what we call an old shop-keeper Mr Knowlys I ask you whether you do not know Carr to be a young man very respectably related and very decently brought up - Yes I am sorry to know it Mr Leach I believe the prisoner Smith stated him to be a man of fortune and character - Yes Did Smith appear at all to interfere with respect to the purchase of the seal - No I looked upon him as a thief when he came into the shop he wanted to divert my attention In the coach as you was going along I believe you thanked him and was obliged to him for his interference - I may have said things improperly Did not you in terms thank him - I cannot say I did Did not you say so in terms Prisoner Smith You will pardon me Sir when I observe he has a very convenient memory Prosecutor When the man came into the shop I formed a very different opinion of him to what I do now I considered that victim in the middle Carr to be a guilty man but I believe him now to be drawn in by the other two villains Then there was nothing in the appearance of Smith of a guilty man at the time - No but he urged more particularly that it would be the ruin of him if he was to go before a magistrate he said that Carr was a man of fortune Prisoner Smith Did not you say that you were very unhappy to have me committed but that the next day you would do your endeavours to have me liberated -I did represent to the magistrate that it was through you I got my seal I think you stated that Smith remained with you in the coach - Lacey offered me any money Mr Knapp prisoner Garland s counsel How long a time might elapse from the time you set off from your door to Jewin-street - About forty or fifty minutes The person whoever it was that put the glove in the coach you did not see - No I only saw a hand You understood that Polock knew Garland - Yes Had the coach stopped in Jewin-street before Polock came up or afterwards - Polock came up with another man and I suppose was the means of the coach stopping How long after do you suppose that Garland came up - Immediately RICHARD HILLIARD sworn When I went into the shop I saw Carr and Smith I knew Carr very well Smith I had seen Mr Janaway desired I would take these two men backwards and search them I searched them very correctly and I was convinced they had nothing about them Mr Janaway did not seem satisfied and thought they had it about them I searched them a second time in the course of the second search the prisoner Carr seemed desirous to make Mr Janaway satisfaction for the seal by offering to pay for it Mr Janaway declined it and Smith repeatedly said if you know any thing of the seal let the gentleman have it we were half an hour in this way Mr Janaway at last gave me charge of them the coach was called we got into it I desired Mr Janaway and his young gentleman to accompany me to the Compter the prisoner Carr said if we go to the publick-house I think I shall be able to get it for you where shall we drive to says Carr we will drive to the Cape Coast Castle that is a house which I knew it is frequented by several bad people I did not think the place fit to take a gentleman to and we drove to the City Arms in Lombard-street the person was not there and we drove to the Bull s-head in Leadenhall-street when we got out of the coach I said to Carr where are you going says he I am going to Chapman s says he if I can see Garland I shall get the seal I have known Garland a number of years we went to Chapman s he was not there we returned to the coach and drove to the Half Moon Aldersgate-street turning the corner of Jewin-street I saw Garland at a distance says I here comes Garland I had seen Polock in Leadenhall-street the prisoner Carr had desired Polock to look for Garland I believe I said here comes Garland with the seal in an instant Garland came to the coach-door Mr Janaway and I and Gregg sat with our faces to the horses Garland retired to the hind pannel of the coach so that we lost sight of him and in a minute a glove was put into the coach that glove was given to Carr Carr gave it to Mr Janaway and out of that glove came the seal Mr Knowlys I believe you know that Carr has been very well brought up - I have known Carr not intimately but I say upon my oath I have been fourteen years with Mr West at the Poultry-compter and I declare he has never been in custody there Mr Leach Carr was seemingly very desirous to make satisfaction and Smith said If you know any thing of the seal give it to the gentleman - He certainly did And seemed very anxious Carr should restate the seal if he had it - He certainly did Mr Janaway at that time did declare that he really thought Smith was innocent - He did Did he make use of any terms expressive of his satisfaction - He said he was very sorry for Smith Prisoner Smith Did you hear the prosecutor at any time say Why give him trouble - The prosecutor said when terms were offered to him I will accept of none all I want is my property Did you think Carr would have beenliberated on production of the seal or detained - Mr Janaway using the expression all I want is my seal he always from the first moment seemed very favourable to you but very much against Carr Did he not say that it was merely on my account and my honest behaviour that he had gone so far and given himself so much trouble - Something of that sort was mentioned but the words I cannot recollect Prisoner Garland Whether or not there were not three men at the coach side besides myself - There were two or three two I saw Prisoner Smith Did I at any time express my knowledge of those houses that you spoke of - No I do not recollect that you did MOSES POLOCK sworn I know Mr Carr well enough I cannot say I know any thing else of the other two much Mr Garrow Much What do you mean by much - Why I know nothing at all of Smith Never saw him before - I have seen him How often - Why may be three or four times In company with whom - Why may be I have seen him in the street by himself Now do not give me any more of your may bes with whom have you seen him - I have not seen him in company with any body I may be saw him walking in the street by himself Did you never see him in company with any body - With somebody that I know nothing of never saw him in company with the prisoners in my life I have known Garland by sight four or five months Do you remember being applied to by Mr Carr to go any where on this day - I was to go to Cape Coast Castle to see for Garland I came back to the Black Bull in Leadenhall-street I said he was not there he desired me to go to the Half Moon in Aldersgate-street to tell Mr Garland to wait there till he came going along I met Mr Garland the corner of Philpot-lane London-wall says I Mr Carr wants you at the Half Moon he is coming there in a coach going along Jewin-street the coach overtook us and Mr Carr saw Garland and he said Mr Garland I want that there as I gave you and Mr Garland took a glove out of his hat that he had on his head with a false lining and put the glove into the coach That is the same Mr Garland that is there - Yes it is And that is the same Mr Carr that was in the coach - Yes What name did you know Mr Smith by - I never knew him by any particular name You did not know his name - No Sir Mr Knapp Garland went with you directly - Yes When Carr called Garland he immediately attended to his call - He did WILLIAM HOPKINS sworn I am servant to Mr Parker my master and mistress were at Mr Janaway s shop on this day I saw the two prisoners go into the shop I saw them in the street some little time before they were looking at the shop they seemed to be looking at some seals Did they appear to be looking about the shop in any way that made an impression on you - Yes I thought they looked rather suspicious they went in together they continued in some little time not a great while they came out again together one after another in a great hurry I saw the stoutest of the two that is Carr give something to a tall person in the street and that person immediately ran How near was the other gentleman in blue to the short man at the time he gave something to the tall man - They were running one after another as near as they could Mr Janaway brought them back again almost immediately The prisoner Garland looks something like the tall man to whom Carr gave something I cannot say he was the man he was such a made man ROBERT NEWMAN sworn I am one of the city constables I apprehendedGarland on Thursday the 22d of March I did not search him Prisoner Carr I leave it to my counsel HENRY NORTH sworn I live in Tooley-street a glass-manufacturer I have known Carr a great many years twenty years I never knew any harm of him I always thought him a very honest man Mr Garrow My Lord my friend has a great many more to character I know Mr North to be a very respectable man as far as character goes you may suppose he has called one hundred respectable witnesses Mr Leach on the part of Smith I have many respectable witnesses PRISONER SMITH s DEFENCE My Lord if you will permit me to trespass on your patience while I represent facts which I trust will impress your Lordship and the Jury with the clearest idea of my innocence I had been returning from Greenwich and unfortunately met Mr Carr he asked me to walk with him I readily complied I went with him we had some little discourse respecting the lottery he said he had great success he had a watch without a seal we went in to see some seals however Mr Janaway may prevaricate himself they entirely exculpated me of any wish to divert their attention on some disagreement Mr Carr left the shop I immediately left the shop and followed him prior to this there was a person in company with Carr he did not go into the shop he went to the front shop Carr joined this man shook hands and bid him a good day we proceeded a little way further and Janaway followed us he said he had lost his seal and while I remained in the shop the circumstance of this man being in company I was under some agitation of mind Mr Janaway repeatedly exculpated me gave me all those assurances that he wanted nothing with me wanted nothing but his property from those expressions and the intimacy I had with Carr induced me to say to him If you have the gentleman s property restore it to him Hilliard joined in my entreaties and said Carr why not return the gentleman his property under these solicitations and under the influence as I then seemed and as Hilliard repeatedly said at our examination he said you speak to him I immediately said to Mr Janaway If Carr will produce your seal will you drop the business he said I want nothing but my property now they had entirely exculpated me with any knowledge of the houses to whom the coach was to drive to at the time his seal was produced I rather thought that Carr and myself should be liberated I thought I merited thanks for the pains I took he has thought proper since to change his opinion of me whatever the verdict may be I must bow with resignation the person s name in company was Thomas Stout THOMAS STOUT sworn I know the prisoner Smith I was in company with him Tuesday fortnight the 13th of March about nine in the morning between nine and ten we went to Greenwich together he came to my house and

passage where they sell Burton-ale in Cheapside says he I am going to buy a seal I have had money in the lottery I thought he was a gentleman that spoke to Smith I heard every word that was said between them all the time I think it was past three to the best of my recollection and they asked me whether I would go and I said I must go home another man came and said how do you do altogether or how do you do gentlemen Then I quitted them immediately I know nothing of the felony the least in the world Did you during this time see Carr pull out a watch - Yes Prisoner Smith Was it possible that

in Trafalgar-row Greenwich On Saturday 22nd Nov about 7 or 8 o clock in the evening I had some pork lying on the board outside—the prisoner asked the price of it she was told it was 7d a pound—there were some customers inside but none outside—I attended to some other customers and in about three-quarters of a minute I missed the pork it was a fore-loin the prisoner was gone too—I went after her but did not find her—I did not know her before—there was gaslight there—I am quite sure there was no other person standing outside near the pork—I am quite sure the prisoner is the woman—it might have been 9 or 10 or it might have been 7 or 8 o clock Q But they are very different times suppose a man had to make his defence he might show where he was at a particular hour A It was between 9 and 10 o clock in the day in Nov —we are in the habit of shutting the shop at 11 and we take supper after we shut up on Saturday nights—it must have been about 9 when the prisoner was there—I was mistaken in saying it was between 7 and 8—on 17th Dec about 6 I was called out of the parlour—I found the policeman and the prisoner in the shop—the police-man had a piece of neck of mutton in his hand—the prisoner had a piece of shoulder of mutton under her left arm—she dropped it—I looked round my shop and missed two pieces of mutton off the front table they were the same that the policeman and the prisoner hand—they were five pounds and a half part of a shoulder and part of a neck I had seen them safe five minutes before—the prisoner had been in my shop between 3 and 4 that afternoon she asked the price of some meat on the table I told her to leave the shop because I remembered her face from the Saturday night of her taking the pork—I did not like to charge her with it I was quite certain of it but as there was no pork on her then it would be hard to prove it Q That is not the reason you gave the Magistrate A Yes I told the Magistrate I told her to leave the shop she was after no good and that she did not wish to buy anything—I thought she was after no good because she bid a very low price for the meat it would have been impossible to serve her Prisoner I went into the shop and asked the price of some pieces you said 4 1/2 d and I offered you 4d you never said another word and I came away Witness No you offered 3d and I told you to go out of the shop—I did not say that I followed you out of the shop when you took the pork and could not see the way you went—I did not say that I saw you go into a hall WILLIAM NOSWORTHY policeman R 324 At a little before 6 o clock on 17th Dec I was on duty in uniform at Trafalgar-row Greenwich about three yards from the prosecutor s door—I saw the prisoner trying to open Mr Clark s gate—I think she did not see me—she came across the road and I think she was watching Mr Clark s more than she was me—there Was nothing to prevent her seeing me if she had looked that way—she went into the shop and opened the little gate which goes half way up the doorway—there was no one in the shop—I saw her go to the table and take a half-shoulder of mutton and put it under her left arm—she turned over some pieces and took a piece of the best end of a neck of mutton about 3lbs —she came out of the shop and was going across the street—I stopped her and asked her what she had got under her cloak—she said Nothing —I took her back and took the piece of mutton from her hand—the half-shoulder she dropped on the floor Prisoner I asked you whether you were going to be shopkeeper for Mr Clark Witness No you did not I did not speak to the servant girl—I never recollect speaking to her in my life till this morning—there were not two little girls in the shop—I did not say the meat was concealed under the block in some sawdust—you knocked down one piece of meat in picking up the shoulder—I never went to where you worked over Black heath and said if they employed you you would rob them—I had heard your name before but I never knew you before Prisoner s Defence I am innocent of stealing the meat I was once taken for stealing a looking-glass and the next morning there was no one there the policeman said a woman saw me steal it and I went

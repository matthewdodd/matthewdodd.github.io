Fleet-Ditch and carried me to the Prisoner Trueman s house I followed the young jade up stairs she sat down in a chair and I sat by her and Hoskins brought up a pint bottle of China Ale I think they call it for I never drank any of that liquor before When we had taken that bottle between us 3 we had another and made an end of that in the same manner Then this young jade asked me to go to bed with her but she was battered and had a black eye so I would not have any thing to say to her but gave her 6 d to be quiet for I was sure she had a mind to do me a mischief Presently she in the red cloak Hoskins came up I ask d her what was her demand she said a shilling but I thought 6 d was enough for those 2 pints did not hold above a pot she said the common price of this house was 12 d for 2 bottles and 6 d for a bottle so I got my hand into my pocket and drew up a shilling and said it was an extravagant house for the liquor was worth nothing and a pint of beer would be better than 5 bottles of it I had clear d my way and was for going off but this young jade Evans took hold of the skirt of my coat and said she would not be quit of me then the other Woman came up took hold of my hair while Evans took me by the body and pick d my money out of my pocket I immediately got hold of Evans and Hoskins cut my fingers and my cheek with a knife to make me let her loose After this they called that gentleman at the bar Trueman up and he beat me in the face and said he would murder me before I should leave the place Then I lost my stock and clasp but which of them took it I can t tell They kept beating and battering me about some time and at last I made my way to the door leaving my hat and cane behind me and met the drawer coming up but I knock d him down stairs again I cried out murder and a Watchman who was crying the hour within 3 yards of the door took me up to the watch-house and afterwards secur d the Prisoners Trueman When you first saw me was you not on the stair-case coming down to get away Cavenagh No I never saw him till he came into the room and gave me a knock in the face Robert Smith I went to assist the watchman in carrying the Prisoners before a magistrate and as we came back Trueman drew this knife and swore if I came near him he would cut me to pieces After we came from Guild-hall and got to the lodge at Newgate Trueman flung a great piece of chalk at me and swore he would be revenged of me Henry Gulston I was going my rounds about 2 o clock and somebody in Trueman s house called Watch I made up to the door and the Prosecutor said he had lost 12 s 6 d his cane hat and clasp and I took him to the watch-house Trueman and the woman in the red cloak Hoskins who goes for his wife were sitting at the door together at the same time and said the man had lost nothing Nicholas Stanley I am a watchman on the 21st of June about a quarter past 2 in the morning I went to the watch-house to leave my lanthorn and staff and the Prosecutor told me he had been robb d and desir d I would assist him in taking the persons and bringing them to justice Accordingly I went down to the house and found Trueman and Hoskins at the door Hoskins immediately ran in doors and on my going into the house to see for her one George Coates told me she was gone out at the back door but Trueman desir d her to come out and then we secur d them William Kingsley I was constable for the night that this thing happen d and hearing a Hurley-burley I sent the watchmen out to see what was the matter and they brought the Prosecutor and three Prisoners to the watch-house The Prosecutor seem d to be in a very bloody condition and had a large cut across the back of his hand and a bruise under one of his eyes He charged the Prisoners with robbing him so I thought it convenient to commit them to the Compter and him to Bridewell till the next morning when they were carried before the Alderman at Guild-hall Daniel Hubbard I am a watchman and as I was coming with the constable from Bridewell I saw Hoskins and Trueman standing at their own door and when I got to the watch-house the Prosecutor was there and complained of this robbery He said he had left his hat and came in the house and I went there and found them all bloody behind the door Prisoner Trueman The Prosecutor brought 2 Women to my house while I was out they went to fighting among themselves and when I came home I went up to them the Prosecutor struck me in the face and then I took to my own defence Thomas Hooker I was drinking last monday with the prosecutor and the prisoner Trueman s brother at the Sun and Cart and the prosecutor said he had nothing to say against Trueman for he did not come up stairs till after he lost his money He said he saw the girl come down Fleetstreet and she asked him to treat her with a pint of beer and upon that he went with her to Trueman s house at Fleet Ditch where they drank a bottle of China Ale for which he paid a shilling That he was going to be conversant with the girl but catching her hand in his pocket he gave her 6 d for her trouble and would not have any thing to say to her for he thought it was enough for her to be a whore only and not a thief too He said they battled together for about 10 or 12 minutes and then Trueman came up and knocked him down backwards at the same time swearing he would murder him That after this another man came up and he lost his stock and clasp in the scuffle but who took it he could not tell This is all that I can remember for his discourse was so imperfect and his expressions so intricate that a man must have the eloquence of Tully to express their meaning William Trueman deposed to the same effect William Mills I have known Trueman from a child and never heard but that he was an honest man till this misfortune happened Samuel Sprig I have known him upwards of 20 years He bore a good character and was always counted an honest man Edward Lee I have known him from a little boy I took him to be an honest man and never heard any thing charged on him till this affair broke out James Titsell I have known him 24 or 25 years and never heard that he was suspected of robbing any body William Spencer I have known him 15 or 16 years and I never heard but that he bore a good character Pris Hoskins I was Mr Trueman s bar-keeper and these people came into our house and when they began to quarrel I gave a young man three half-pence to call my master Pris Evans I and another young woman met the prosecutor in Fleet-street and we went with him to Trueman s house We had a pint of ale for which he paid 3 d and he gave me 3 d for my company and because I would not be great with him he tore off my cloak and stood at the bottom of the stairs swearing he would kill the first man that came up The drawer went up stairs and he did not meddle with him but when the Gentleman Trueman offered to go up he beat him over the fingers and then fell upon us all Nicholas Stanley again The prosecutor sent for me to the constable s house on Sunday and the prisoner s brother was present He told Cavenagh he would satisfy him for his loss provided it could be made up Sam Tunmore I heard Smith the watchman say at the Running-Horse in St John Street that he wanted to speak to one of Mr Trueman s sons One of them happening just then to go by he Smith called him in and told him he did not want to appear as an evidence against his brother and desired to know what Mr Trueman designed to do Jury We desire the constable may be asked what repute Trueman s house is of Kingsley It bears a very indifferent character Jury Was the prosecutor sober when he came to the watch-house Kingsley He was middling He had been drinking but was not drunk Hoskins and Evans guilty Felony Trueman acquitted

I believe between eight and nine the symptoms had then begun and I was in again between ten and eleven when they were worse I have no doubt but you took all possible care would not it tend to disturb the frame to bring the man - Not a doubt of it How long might the delirium continue - He was exceedingly ill many days I thought he would die I did not see him after he went to the hospital a young man that is with me is here - PITTS sworn I attended the prosecutor at the hospital when I first saw him in the hospital he was in a very dangerous state and continued so a great while he was getting well and he came to this court to attend the trial and the trial was put off and he came home exceeding ill indeed a fresh inflammation a cough and a difficulty in breathing and we have been obliged to give him the strictest regimen Mr Peatt Is he much weakened in consequence of his wound - He is I should suppose he is capable since he got the better of that symptom that came on by attending here Court Is there any more common symptom than that of his taking one person for another - Wherever a man is delirious his mind is deranged and his ideas certainly But do you not in point of experience and fact frequently find that persons in a delirium sever take one person for another - Yes Prisoner I leave it all to my counsel Jury I think the prosecutor said he had some previous knowledge of the prisoner - Yes Would it be amiss to ask him how he knew him Court to prosecutor You have no personal knowledge of the prisoner - No Sir You only mean to say that you have seen him more than once - Yes I have seen him more than once Jury By that knowledge of seeing him different times in the street can you swear now to him positively -

upon this another man came up took hold of me by the collar and said D-n his eyes that is the man I know him - I know him I then became very much alarmed and put my hand into my pocket and gave the prisoner a shilling and said it was all I had in my pocket the other man then let go of my collar another man then came up on the other side and took hold of my waistcoat pocket and said He has got more money than that and said That is the man - I know him - his name is Turner I put my hand into my pocket and gave the prisoner 5d - the other man called me a white-faced b-r before that The other two men went away down the street the prisoner remained and said This won t do -

he looked round in a very suspicious way and said in an under tone I only want to borrow it I asked what he meant by saying what he did when he came the day before and had the other 5s he said Oh never mind there is no harm in that I then pressed him very much to tell me what the money was for he said Oh never mind take the 5s back and for God s sake let me go out when he found I would not take the money back he laid it on the lock of the door Ballard then came and took him into custody I know one Fennell he was servant to Mr Cartwright who lived opposite I had seen the prisoner in his company in David-street when I was out on an errand Fennell spoke to me I had no particular acquaintance with Fennell Q What induced you to part with the shilling and the fivepence to the prisoner A I was very much alarmed at what they accused me of knowing myself innocent and three men coming up -

I held the door in my hand all the time - they were not inside Q Why not shut it in their faces A I was so much alarmed I hardly knew what I was doing - the charge frightened me - I was not so much alarmed before the second man came up as after I was perhaps three or four minutes talking to them - it might be five - the street is pretty public - I gave no alarm - I did not tell my fellow servants of it - I told master when he came home - mistress was with him when he went out or I should have told him then -

the prosecutor asked the prisoner how he did- the prisoner said Pretty well - the prosecutor said You don t look so well as when I last saw you the prisoner did not answer COURT Q Did the prosecutor say any thing about not knowing him A I understood the prosecutor that he knew him because he told me his name was George Kelly - that was three weeks or more after we met - I had met him in Regent-street and Oxford-street about three weeks after the first time and he asked me if I knew Kelly - I said not particularly only by meeting him in the street I had always understood his name to be George Reeve till the prosecutor told me it was Relly I had met the prisoner about five minutes before we met the prosecutor in David-street I do not know whether I or the prosecutor spoke first -

take what you like I was very much ill-used - I could not put my foot to the ground for two or three days I saw the prisoner again on the 24th of April the landlord s son had given information and he was taken on the 23d I believe I am quite sure he is the man who took my hat I pointed him out Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q He took your hat off - at that time was he not perfectly alone A I have not asserted that they were with him then I cannot say he was alone I will not swear that he was not it happened on Easter Sunday Q I believe they were all pretty tipsy A I cannot speak to that I was perfectly sober the landlord and his son were looking at part of the transaction Q Do not you know the whole business was a frolic until you hit the prisoner two blows in the face as hard as you could A I acknowledge I did give him two desperate blows in the face - I stood in my own defence I consider if a man takes my hat off it is with intent to rob me that was done in the house not in the skittleground I was stripped of my coat and things in the skittle-ground I have not said that the prisoner was in the skittle-ground or that he was not I struck him with my right arm - that was the worst of the two but I had hold of my hat with my left hand I struck him somewhere about the side of his face as hard as I could Q Had he done more to you than just twisted your hat off in a frolic A I cannot call it a frolic for I was not one of their party I have given my reason for going through the house - I know it was dangerous to go through even any of the passages leading to the house there are several ways out of the house if you had a sister who you understood was laying in a dangerous state you would run all hazards to see her The landlord is not here - his son is who saw part of the transaction Q Did you say before the Magistrate that you were struck anywhere except in your heel A I did I have the trousers which I had on I have not produced them but they are completely destroyed I cannot tell whether he was in the skittle-ground - there was one whom I held by the collar I can describe the dress the prisoner had on I cannot say what he said when he called out as there was a confusion altogether Q If he called out was it not an exclamation at the pain you gave him with the blow A No it was to call his fellow confederates I believe the whole of them are most desperate characters they came to his assistance when he called out I cannot tell what he called out I was not more than a yard from him I have known the landlord twenty years - he came into the skittle-ground when I speak of knowing him twenty years the landlord had forgot the greater part of my knowing him for even with regard to the relationship between my wife and him when he first received the property of his wife s to take this house he did not know me he would not know me in the skittle-ground whether he did know me or not I cannot say his son knew me - he saw some of the desperate usage Q Had you drank anything that night A I had been ill all the week before I had drank part of two pints of porter - that was at the Weavers Arms public-house Grub-street I went there to see the person who keeps the house I had not been in any other public-house - I had drank one glass of gin and cloves it is my usual drink - I cannot do without it for mine is most injurious business it is necessary to take something - I am positive I drank nothing else - I had not the appearance of a man intoxicated WILLIAM BLOWER My father keeps the Queen s Head public-house Green Arbour-court Turk s Head-court Golden-lane On Easter Sunday night Mr Holland cameby my father s bar I was going out into Green Arbour-court he was seized hold of by Donohough who took off his hat - I was standing at the door I looked round and said to him Give the man his hat with that the other thieves came directly - took hold of me and said If you speak a word I will kick your entrails out then they took hold of Holland and pulled his coat off - they took him between the yard-door going towards the skittle-ground they pulled off his coat and waistcoat Q Was he on the ground A No not then they then pulled off his shoes then shoved him down on the ground between the yard door and passage and ran away - then they let me go I got to my father and told him Did you see Holland receive any blows A No when they let me go he got up and went to his sister s house - he had neither coat waistcoat nor shoes on they took them away Q Were these young men who you call thieves in company with the prisoner A Yes he was in company with them and with them assisting in pulling off his coat and things Cross-examined Q Was your father present at any part of the transaction A No he was not - I swear that I heard what the prosecutor has sworn about my father - he was not present at any part of the transaction and knew nothing of it till I told him Q If Holland has sworn your father was present at any part of it it is not true A It is not I did not call out as they said if I spoke a word they would kick my entrails out Q Did you not say before the Magistrate that you desired them to let the young man alone because you knew him A I told them I knew his sister Q Did not the Magistrate say Then I suppose if it had been a stranger you would not have minded A I told the Magistrate if I saw any robbery done I would prevent it if I could my father has kept the house about three years and a half - I was standing at the door when Holland came in his hat was taken off in the house - he turned round and caught hold of the prisoner he did not give the prisoner any blows - I was behind his back he did not strike the prisoner - he could not strike him without my seeing him Q Is all the rest you have sworn quite as true as that A Yes Holland did not appear to me to be in liquor - he had not drank in my father s house the young men had been drinking ale - they appeared high up in liquor Q Had they not been larking about all the evening A Yes they had they had been drinking in my father s house about half an hour before Holland came in - Holland s sister lives in Green Arbour-court he could go directly out of Golden-lane to the court - that is a broad street he could go into the court without coming through our house - I should not have been afraid to have gone he did not appear to have been drinking - Mr Bennett the Magistrate of Worship-street told my father he had no occasion to come here he did not see anything of the transaction at all COURT Q You did not see Holland strike the prisoner were you not surrounded by these people A I was surround directly Holland s hat was taken off - there was no violent blows used at all neither to the prisoner nor the prosecutor Q Had you seen these parties whom you call thieves at your father s house before A I had seen them in the neighbourhood they had been to the bar to have a drop of liquor - but never to sit down and stop at our house before I had seen them before that in company in the neighbourhood and at my father s bar JURY Q Was you in the bar when the prosecutor first came into the house A I was at the door going out to Green Arbour-court I saw him come in -

he had a scratch on his face rather on the lip and on his left ear I begged of him to go up stairs after taking him in I went to Mr Blower the landlord I saw him with a party round the bar called him aside and asked if he knew anything about the robbery he was very saucy and very much in liquor the pot-boy was called and he knew nothing about it the son was called and he knew nothing about it I said they should hear of it in the morning and in the morning Mr Blower came to me Cross-examined Q Then the blows have come to a scratch on his lip A Yes he had a scratch on his lip and seemed very much exhausted the son said that night that he knew nothing about it but next morning he came and acknowledged it JOHN PATRICK HOLLAND I have got none of my property back GUILTY Aged 17 Of stealing the hat from the person but not with force or violence -

t18281204-208  Before Mr Baron Hullock 208 RICHARD CATTLE and GEORGE SMITH were indicted for feloniously assaulting Mary Ann Powers on the 1st of November putting her in fear and taking from her person and against her will 5 sovereigns the monies of Elizabeth Smith widow MESSRS BRODRICK & PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution MARY ANN POWERS I am servant to Mrs Elizabeth Smith of Margaret-street Hackney I know the prisoner- Cattle is a baker and pastry-cook and Smith I believe is a baker On the 1st of November I went to take a pie to Cattle s shop - Smith came in just as I was coming out in the course of the time Smith sent me out for some gin - Cattle poured out about half a glass I took a little of it and in the course of conversation I said I was going to Hoxton in the evening both the prisoners were present when I said that about twenty minutes before six o clock I went out from mistress to go to Mr Hunter s Britannia-gardens Hoxton to receive 5l I had a receipt for it in my hand mistress desired me to go a public way I passed Cattle s shop in my way - I owed him 1d for a tart - I went in and paid for it Smith came in directly I got into the shop - I do not know whether I then mentioned where I was going the prisoners went out of the shop I remained there five or ten minutes talking to Mrs Cattle and then went out Cattle overtook me when I got to the Goldsmiths alms-houses in Hackney-road and said he was going my way I said Are you I saw Smith in a few minutes he came up they were talking together - I could not hear what they said after going on a little while I heard Cattle tell Smith what a pretty sweetheart he was for he had never spoken to me all the way I went on and got at last to Pitfield-street and at the corner of that street I asked Cattle if he would be so kind as to come down Britannia-gardens as it was such a lonesome place he said he was in a hurry to get his yeast but if I would go as far as St Luke s church with him he would see me to Britannia-gardens I went with him - Smith went also and when we got a little distance they both asked me to go into a public-house to have something to drink I went in and Smith gave me a glass of gin which I drank - I stopped by St Luke s church while he got his yeast - we were all three together Q Well after that you set off to Britannia-gardens A Yes I went to Mr Hunter s and received five sovereigns - the prisoners waited for me by agreement till I came out- I wrapped the five sovereigns in a piece of paper and put them in my bosom - my gown was pinned over it and my apron tied over that - I found them waiting for me Cattle said had I got what I went for I said Yes - I had the receipt in my hand in his shop it had a stamp on it I kept it in my hand all along the road after going a little way Cattle said if I had got any paper or any thing to take care of he would take care of it for me I said I was capable of taking care of it myself they asked me to go to a house No 9 opposite Britannia-gardens - I refused Smith said it would not hurt me - he took me by the hand and pulled me in I do not remember whether Cattle said any thing - we all three went in some gin was called for Smith brought me a glass to the window which I drank - I do not know who paid for it I was standing by the window and had not sat down the prisoners were at the bar I came out with them we turned down a court by the side of the public-house - it was dark I said I did not know where I was Cattle said I was going right about five or ten minutes after this I felt very sick and giddy Cattle repeated two or three times that he would take care of what I had if I would give it to him I refused - I do not remember going to any other house except one where I had a glass of liquor thrown over me and I believe that was the Red Cow public-house at Dalston Smith threw it over me because I would not drink it - I have no recollection whatever of what happened after I got out of this public-house till I remember the patrol taking me up off the ground - I am seventeen years old and single - I have lived at Mrs Smith s four years Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q How far from Cattle s shop does your mistress live A A very short distance - about as far as from here to Newgate I knew him perfectly well - mistress never went to his shop he was known in the neighbourhood I was at this house twice that day but did not say what I was going to Hoxton for - the recipt was folded up in my hand - nobody could see what it was - I do not recollect telling either of them I was going for money I had only known Smith about three weeks - I had seen him at Cattle s Q As you were insensible from the time you left the public-house till the patrol came up can you venture to say you did not give Cattle the money to take care of A I cannot swear whether I gave it him - whether I dropped it or whether it was taken from me I have not the least recollection of giving it to him and think if I had done so I must recollect it I wore a close dress pinned up at the bosom I put the money down near the pit of my stomach then put up my dress and tied my apron over it the gin thrown over me went down my neck I did not open my bosom to wipe it Q After you got out was there no romping or toying between Smith and you A Not that I recollect Cattle s brother came to our house on Sunday morning while I was at chapel and I went to where cattle was but did not see him I spoke to him throught the rails Q Did you not say to him I won t hurt you - I am sure you did not intend to rob me A No I did not he said If you say I took the money from you it will transport me for life and I said I cannot say whether I gave it you or not that is all I said MR PHILLIPS Q Why did you go to the watch-house A By the persuasion of his brother or somebody who came JOSEPH WATSON I am a patrol of Hackney On the 1st of November I was on duty in Pigwell-field - there is a passage leading from there to a place called London-field at the back of Grange s nursery - it is enclosed by a wall on one side and a bank on the other - It is two hundred and sixty-four yards long I heard a female voice screaming for assistance in that place about half-past nine o clock at night - I went to the spot and when I got there I got on the bank and saw the prisoner Smith with this young woman on the ground apparently attempting they were nearer to the wall than the bank I got over the bank collared him and pulled him up and told him he was ill-using the young woman - he made no answer at that time I got the prosecutrix on her feet - she seemed verymuch fatigued and was in liquor she put her hand into her bosom and said I have not got it I asked her what it was - she said she had lost 5l I asked Smith if he had got it he said No Cattle had got it - and then she said Cattle had got it the bosom of her gown was open and her shawl laid on the ground the pins were out of her gown and her breast quite exposed - the gown appeared to me to have been torn open Smith was very much intoxicated Q When you came up did you hear any thing A After I got over the bank I spoke and the young woman said she was robbed she said she had lost her money I thought I heard footsteps in the road I went a few yards from Smith in the direction of the steps I met another patrol and asked if he had met a man he said Yes - I said Well bring him back he has robbed a woman of 5l - I spoke loud - I did not see the man I then returned to Smith and told him I should take him to the watch-house he said I should not or he would not go I however took him there and the prosecutrix went I did not myself take Smith there as another patrol came up at the spring of the rattle he took him and I took the prosecutrix there two patrols overtook us on the road with Cattle - when I had been in the watch-house about ten minutes I saw Cattle give Cowley a piece of brown paper with five sovereigns in it he said the girl had given him the money to take care of I did not hear any thing said before that but my attention was particularly directed to the girl who was in a fainting state - Smith gave me the name of Dick Barlow Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Were you near enough to hear what Cattle said when he produced the money A I did not notice - he was rather the worse for liquor but not so bad as Smith Q When she said her money was gone Smith said Cattle had it and she said Yes Cattle has it A Yes JOHN CALLER I am a patrol of Hackney On the evening of the 1st of November I was on duty in the lane and saw Cattle - I met him walking I said Patrol and bade him good night and after that I saw Watson fifteen or twenty yards behind me - I cannot say whether Cattle could hear what he said as the wind blew away from him he said something to me and in consequence of that I went after Cattle who continued walking till I got very near to him and then took to running I had said nothing to him then but when he ran I said You had better stop young man and sprang my rattle - he continued running I ran but could not overtake him - there are three paths on that spot he did not take the path towards Margaret-street - he was a mile or two out of his way from Hoxton to Margaret-street I sprang my rattle and after that went back to Smith Watson and the prosecutrix as I could not overtake him - on the way to the watch-house the prosecutrix began crying as her petticoats fell off Smith said Don t cry - I said Have you got this young woman s money he said No I have not Cattle has it - I asked her for it and if she had given it to me I would have put it where no b-r alive could have found it two patrols overtook us with Cattle in custody - I said to Smith Then this is the man who has got her money he said Yes that is Cattle he has got her money - I do not think he was near enough to hear that said I said nothing to him about the money in Cattle s presence - when we got to the watch-house I gave charge of them Cowley asked me the charge - I said We have brought in these two young men on suspicion of robbing this young woman of 5l Cattle immediately said It is no robbery at all - here are the five sovereigns which she gave me to take care of and gave them up directly to Cowley the constable of the night who is since dead they were then locked up SAMUEL TREWBRIDGE I am a patrol of Hackney I was on duty on the 1st of November between eight and nine o clock at night - I heard a rattle spring and saw Cattle coming towards me at a regular walking pace I went up to him and called him - he said at first I am not the man it is a young man and a young woman over in the field I said I must detain you - he said I had no right to detain him and as he spoke I perceived he caught his breath I said You are out of breath and I shall detain you - he said I was doing him an injury in detaining him and keeping him from his business I said I did not wish to injure him - if he would go with me to the party I would not detain him if they said he was not the person we proceeded across the fields - I do not remember his saying any thing more he did not say a word about having any money - I took him across the fields and met Gregory the patrol and left him in his custody I went on and called Pilton who came to me - the place is a narrow passage I went back to where Cattle was and heard Pilton say to him Cattle you are the man who robbed the girl - I do not remember his answer but think he said How do you know Pilton said If I had not known you how should I have picked you out from the rest a gentleman hearing this said Now you secure him - secure his hands I proceeded towards Hackney watch-house with him in custody and overtook Smith in custody near the Cock public-house - up to that time Cattle had not said a word about the money but then something was mentioned that he had the money the impression on my mind is that he owned having it then - we went to the watch-house where Smith gave another name Cross-examined Q When Cattle said he was not the man you had not charged him with any thing whether it was for stealing money or for assaulting a woman with intent to ravish her he could not tell A No - I did not know myself he said he had the money before he got to the watch-house JAMES GREGORY I am a patrol Trewbridge gave Cattle to me - he was in my charge for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour and did not say a word about having any money I did not go to the watch-house with him Cross-examined Q Did he say he had done nothing wrong A Yes JOHN PILTON I am a patrol I had Cattle in custody and said You are the man who robbed the woman of the 5l - he made no answer then I took him down to the watch-house - when he saw the other prisoner he said he had got the money in his pocket on his left-hand side that was nearly a quarter of an hour after I had made the charge against him CATTLE -

I know the two female prisoners On the 2nd of August I went to No 7 Francis-street Vinegar-yard - Henson opened the door to me I sent out for a quartern and a half of gin - I had two sovereigns and four half-sovereigns but no silver I sent half a sovereign out for the gin - Henson and Wilson partook of it with me another quartern and a half was got which Henson gave Wilson the money for - the witness Murray came in and partook of the gin and soon after the prisoner King came in we had some coffee I sat down on a sofa in the room and am quite certain when I sat down that I had my purse in my bosom - soon afterwards Wilson King and Murray accompanied me into the yards leaving Henson in the room a piece of tobacco-pipe was thrown down into the yard as if from the room we had just left and just at that time Wilson said Take care Miss Elliss you don t drop your purse down that hole - I did not observe any hole I said Oh no it is in my bosom - I put my hand to my bosom and said immediately Oh no it is gone I immediately returned to the room and the purse was on the sofa - I opened it and immediately said I have been robbed three half-sovereigns and some silver were gone - Wilsonsaid I did that with a view to make her give me money and that I had it concealed about my person I undressed and they searched me all over every thing except my under garment was taken off - nothing whatever was found on me I then opened my purse and emptied it out on the table - there were two sovereigns and some silver in it the three half-sovereigns were not there - the three prisoners and Murray were in the room as I was gathering my money up into my purse a sovereign was gone off the table - I said Yes you have taken another sovereign some one then put their hand on the table and upset it with the other sovereign and the silver on the floor - I looked on the floor and said Here is a sovereign I caught it up and picked up some of the silver - Murray picked up some and gave to me that is all I got I said You have robbed me now of all but a sovereign and a little silver - Wilson told me if I did not leave the house I should repent having said they robbed me King then said Do you say Miss Elliss that I have got your money - I said I don t know which of you have got it but I am certain one of you have for in this house I have lost it King then took off her clothes to satisfy me she had not got it - she then said she would make me repent saying she had taken my money and struck me I cried and Wilson immediately struck me - Henson then told me I was to leave the house when Wilson and King struck me he said Give it her bl-y well - he then asked me what I wanted I told him I wanted my money - he said if I had lost any money I might go and seek my redress and fetch a Policeman I said I would not leave the house till I had the money I had lost there - he said he had 16s in his pocket which he would give me if I would leave the house and be quiet for he was master and would not have a row there he did not produce it - I would not take the 16s and he tried to push me out of the house and I resisted he then struck me a violent blow on the forehead and my eye swelled up - Wilson and King then struck me in the face and my eye burst out bleeding I fainted and fell on the ground close to the door - after recovering I endeavoured to get up but all the three prisoners held me down I screamed Murder - I was so faint I could not resist either of them I am certain Wilson and King were pressing me down and Henson was close to them - I was obliged to bite Wilson to extricate myself in this scuffle I found I had lost a neck-chain and an eye-glass - the chain that was about my neck was off my person I inquired for them - they told me they were about the place some where I did not get them again - they then all three struck me and tried to push me out of the room into the street one of my ear-rings came out and the other was torn out flesh and all and the blood was streaming down my neck- I screamed Murder they pushed me out and locked the door upon me and threw my bonnet out after me - King and Murray remained in the house I knocked at the door violently to get Murray out - the door was opened and I saw two brokers enter the house I went in - the brokers claimed 22s for rent all the prisoners were there - Wilson said she was going to send 11s to the landlord in the course of the day and soon after Henson tendered some money to the brokers whether it was 11s or 16s I do not know - the broker refused to take it Wilson then looked at henson told him to go up stairs and he would find two half-sovereigns under a pot - he went and brought down a purse not mine and was going to take the money out I did not see the money for I entreated the brokers not to take it as it was my money and I had been robbed of it - the broker did not take it King went out with him to give the money - I asked the broker if he was an officer to protect me he said he was not and went out promising to send me an officer - I went to Gibbons house right opposite to wash myself my face was at this time bleeding profusely and my ear my neck and back were bleeding - while I was washing King came to the window and when she saw the door open she came in and said Now Miss Elliss do you say I gave you that black eye I said You and the rest of them - my eye and ear were bleeding then she then came in and struck me in the mouth and my mouth burst out bleeding - Mrs Gibbons and every body saw her do that three officers came and I was taken in a coach to the station Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Are you sure Louisa Rebecca Ellis is your real name A That is my real name - I never went by any other names in my life I never went by the name of Rebecca French - I was never called or known by that name or any other than I have given I am a housekeeper and am partly under the protection of a gentleman who was in Switzerland at the time - he wrote to me from there on the 21st of June he left town sixteen or eighteen days before this - I occasionally see other gentlemen I had never been to this house before - I went there to see Wilson having heard she was ill and I had previously known her- I did not find it to be a company house I was on good terms with Wilson - I left home about a quarter or half-past ten o clock I called on Mr Buchanan my doctor and on Mrs Buckmaster a dress-maker to know where Wilson lived I called no where else and drank nothing before I got to Wilson s - I usually drink wine but sometimes take none all day Wilson asked if I would take any thing - I said I did not care and asked what she would have - she said gin and gin was sent for I took part of a glass - three quarterns were sent for while I was there a dirty little girl was sent for it Q Will you swear eleven quarterns were not sent for before you went into the yard A I swear it was not so and that I was sober - I felt a sensation after taking the coffee which I never felt before - it was not through the gin two hours nearly elapsed between my taking the coffee and the gin - I did not go to sleep on the sofa I felt faint after taking the coffee for eight or ten minutes they were all in the room then - I had seen Murray several times before she is a woman of the town Q Did you join the party she was in A The truth is I was ashamed she should see me there and turned my head when she entered and she wished to avoid me - we were obliged to recognize each other before I sat on the sofa some triffling dispute arose about the French polish on my table - Wilson was speaking of her table being polished I told her I had spoiled mine with French polish and should not have been out but I was going to my cabinet-maker s to send to do it again we had a little dispute about it but not a quarrel - I was not sick at all there I went into the yard complaining of faintness - when I left home I had four half-sovereigns two sovereigns and 5s 6d which my servant put into my purse I paid 6d for an omnibus to Mr Buchanan s in Finsbury-terrace and 5s I paid away - I swear I was perfectly sober - the chains and eye-glass were taken from me after I was struck when I entered the house again Murray told me King had taken a pair of ear-rings and handed them to somebody - they hung in my ears in two holes Q When you returned to the room and charged the persons with stealing your money did they not one and all become indignant at it A Only Wilson - King said nothing till she offered to be searched but she had been out of the room several hours we all nearly stripped - they did not say any of the money had fallen from me when on the sofa - it might have gone down some cracks the carpet was taken up after the table was thrown over but no money found I took up one sovereign before the carpet was taken up - it was not taken up till after I returned to the room it was kicked along the edges but not taken up and folded - I observed no hole in the yard when I returned to the room I found a pipe with a piece broken off it I did not fight with King - I defended myself as well as I could she was dreadfully abusive but I could not contend with her - my ear-rings were not torn out in the scuffle I was upon my feet when they were torn from me - they were then trying to eject me from the house the officer has my ear-rings and chains - I still miss a brooch a comb which was in my hair has been found since Q Did you not state at the Police-office that you believed they did not intend to rob you A I said I was extremely ill-used - I was cross-examined and Mr Platt all but urged it on me he told me to remember the prisoners and said Don t you think it possible they tore the things from you with a view to disfigure you and injure you and at last I said by his persuasion possibly it might be so but that was not the statement I gave before Mr Broughton - I said I thought it very impossible and next to impossible that my purse could have fallen out of my bosom I had a high neck dress on fastened behind - I put my purse inside Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did you at any time tell Mary Gibbs that you did not believe Henson had robbed you A Never - she is my washerwoman I never told her so - she begged me to be merciful to Henson and to spare him but she wished the women might be punished I said I would not more than I could help but I must speak the truth and I believed it was him received the money from King - I never asked Murray if Henson had any property or that I had inquired and found he had- I never inquired about it I do not know Howarth - I was fainting in the street and had a glass of water but from whom I do not know - I was never in Howarth s house I swear I was sober - the child only fetched three half-quarterns of liquor while I was in the house MR PHILLIPS Q How often do you think King left the room before she offered to be searched A I think three times but will swear to two - I did not find either of my half-sovereigns I only went there to see Wilson - she had previously told me how very badly she was off and had neither money nor clothes when I got there she told me she was ill she had not been out for a week and had no clothes to come out in I went to relieve her - my ears are now so sore the rings are fastened to them with loops COURT Q You said at the examination you did not think the chains and ear-rings were taken to rob but to injure you A Yes - I am perfectly satisfied if they could have taken them they would MARY ANN MURRAY I live at No 42 James-street Hoxton On the 7th of August I was at Wilson s house in Francis-street I found the prosecutrix Henson and Wilson there when I entered - King came in in about a quarter of an hour Elliss was sitting down in a chair when I went in after having some gin she took some coffee and sat on the sofa - King sat on the foot of the sofa about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after taking the coffee she said she felt rather faint she was not sick - Wilson and I accompanied her into the yard a pipe of tobacco was thrown down and Wilson said You have dropped your purse mind your purse for there are holes in the yard she missed her purse - we returned to the room and she found her purse on the sofa opened it and accused them of robbing her of three half-sovereigns she took off the best part of her things because they supposed she had the money about her - no half-sovereigns were found she then opened her purse and put out two sovereigns and some silver on the table - the table was upset I do not know how - Elliss did not do it the three prisoners were in the room - Elliss picked up a sovereign and some silver was found Elliss said one of the sovereigns she had put on the table was gone - King said You may think yourself lucky you have got that for there are cracks in the boards the carpet was moved to search - I remember King pulling off her clothes nothing was found on her Q We understand there was an outrage and the brokers came in - in what state was Elliss face and ears at that time A Bleeding and she was without her chains and ear-rings - she complained that her property was in the house the brokers demand 22s - some money was offered them Elliss said Don t take it it is my money - I am robbed some officers came I went with her to the station-house she was very faint then - she had washed before that Wilson said to Henson Go up stairs and you will find the money to pay the brokers I got the chains and things afterwards and handed them to the constable the half-sovereigns and sovereign were never found Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You and Ellis are in the same kind of life A Yes and the female prisoners also I got to the house about half-past eleven or twelve o clock in the morning there was some gin in a decanter on the table - there appeared very little and in about five minutes Elizabeth Howard the little girl came when Wilson called her to fetch an errand which was more gin I think it was about a pint decanter - I will not swear it would not hold a quart I swear Howard did not go for gin above three times - I did not notice whether she took the decanter none of us got drunk gin was only fetched three times and it was only 6d worth each time Q Will you swear the girl did not go nine times and that there was not as many as eleven quarterns and a half of gin A Yes I have had no conversation with Elliss about Henson having property not a word she did not ask if he had property or say she had made inquiry andfound he had I did not strip King did Elliss charged them all with the robbery King took off her stays and flannel petticoat - we were not all almost naked together in the room only King and the prosecutrix stripped when the quarrel began King fought nearly naked Elliss clothes were on she did not fight I heard Wilson say she had bit her on the ground but I did not see her bite or fight she tried to defend herself not by striking but by begging of them for mercy she was not drunk at any part of the transaction I was at Gibbons she was not drunk there - I had about three glasses I suppose we were drinking from half-past eleven or twelve to one o clock something was said about French polish but the quarrel did not begin till Elliss accused them of robbing her violence followed that and I begged of them not to ill-use her I cannot tell who upset the table the carpet was over the middle of the room no cracks were pointed out Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Are you in the habit of taking gin so early A No I was not the least in liquor there was no quarrel about the French polish nor any altercation - I picked up one chain and King the quizzing-glass and gave it to me to give Elliss I had not known Elliss long - when the broker came Wilson said the money was up stairs MR PHILLIPS Q Was there any quarrel or dispute about the French polish A No Elliss did not appear faint or ill till after she had had the coffee COURT Q Where you at the table all the time the gin was there A Yes Elliss partook of part of what was sent for - she had about three glasses ANN PHILLIPS I am servant to Miss Elliss On the 2nd of August she went out about eleven o clock in the morning - I saw two sovereigns four half-sovereigns and some silver on her dressing-table before she went out - I put it into her purse in her presence she went out immediately Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q How did you happen to put it in A I always assist in dressing her and saw her count her money HENRY PICKFORD I am a broker and live at Eastrow On the 2nd of August I went to this house for 22s - I waited for the door to be opened the warrant was signed against Wilson - Henson is not master of the house I saw the prisoners there and saw Elliss in the act of putting her petticoats on - she had a blow on one eye which bled profusely I did not observe her ears - she seemed particularly agitated and said she had been robbed - all the prisoners were there Henson offered me 11s which I refused - some person said Go up stairs and fetch the money I cannot swear which it was but I think it was Wilson - some money was brought down which Henson offered me I did not see whether it was gold or silver for Elliss immediately caught hold of my hands to prevent my taking it saying she had been robbed of it she certainly knew what she was doing though agitated Henson said if she had been robbed to seek her redress - I afterwards went into the next house which was empty King came in after me and I received from her two half-sovereigns and 2s - she said if the prosecutrix had been robbed it served her right for she had robbed hundreds Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q This is a house where girls of the town live A I presume so I certainly took the prosecutrix to be the worse for liquor but still to know what she was about Murray seemed the most collected - I did not notice any being the worse for liquor but the prosecutrix I did not know this house before nor the prosecutrix though it seems she had seen me the landlord-had informed me he wished to get rid of the party because it was a had house Henson did not offer to send for a Policeman in my hearing I was not above ten minutes settling my business - Elliss said For God s sake if you are an officer protect me for I have been ill-used and robbed Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q You found you had seen Elliss before A She bought an article at my shop two months before and I took it home her name is on the door on a brass plate MR PHILLIPS Q Did Murray appear perfectly capable of observing what occurred and understanding it A Certainly COURT Q Can you say whether Elliss appearance arose from agitation or intoxication A No I cannot say that she appeared particularly agitated DANIEL BRETT I am servant to Thomas Hempson of East-row coal-merchant I was at work next door to Wilson s house heard a disturbance and saw Elliss she complained of being robbed - I know Henson very well I saw him go up stairs in the house and fetch a purse down - I saw him take two sovereigns out of it and offer to King - she took it and went into the next house with Mr Pickford Elliss said It is my money I have been robbed do not take it Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Was Elliss drunk or sober A She was not tipsy I cannot say she was right because she had three glasses of gin for I saw it fetched - I was at work painting next door I do not know how many houses of ill-fame there are in the street I do not live in the neighbourhood - I went into the house to assist the broker I did not see Elliss drink the gin but speak from what she said at Worship-street I saw the little girl go out with a basket but only once - I was there from ten o clock to five I heard a noise in the house between two and three and between three and four I went with the broker to distrain - it was about four I saw the little girl go out with a basket - I did not see the bottle I saw the bottle on the table when the door was open - it was a green bottle not a decanter I did not go in then for the warrant was not signed - the bottle held about half a pint - it was not so large as a wine or porter bottle it was a green bottle - I do not know whether it was a decanter I saw no gin in it it was just as I passed the door to go to work - the door opens directly into the room when I heard Elliss say I have lost my money they instantly shut the door - the broker had not come I went to look for him he came down with me and we waited outside about a quarter of an hour till Henson opened the door it was not open when we got there - I cannot say Elliss was tipsy she was not right down sober Murray was and so was Henson MR PHILLIPS Q Murray was able to attend to what was going on and to give a correct account A She was ANN ELIZA GIBBONS I am the wife of John Gibbons a watch spring-maker and live at No 16 Francis-street Wilson s house is No 7 On the 2nd of August I heard a screaming there and a voice exclaiming You have robbed me give me my money I will have my money about a quarter of an hour after that I saw King come out and go to No 18 next door but one to me where she lodged - when she got into the street I heard her say I have done her and I am the one that can do her I will give her a b-y good hiding and b-r her - she came out of that house in about ten minutes and went into Wilson s house again after that I heard several voices but my attention was most particularly drawn to the voice saying Give me my money which I heard repeatedly - King came out of the house again in the same bouncing manner as before using much the same expressions she went back again and every time she went back the noise was greater - I saw the door open Henson was on the side of the prosecutrix and Wilson with her hands up as if she had hold of the prosecutrix Henson was in a stooping position and so was the prosecutrix with her leg turned up behind - I only saw the back part of her leg I did not see Henson do any thing then I afterwards saw him strike the prosecutrix I was then standing opposite their door - the door was shut too after that I heard screams of Murder and saw the prosecutrix violently shoved out of the house she knocked for admittance and her bonnet was thrown out to her - her face was bleeding she said I have been robbed in that house and cruelly beat and desired me to send for a Policeman which I did - I took her into my house to wash her and she was in a dreadful state the blood poured from both her ears and she had a dreadful black eye - her senses were quite correct when she spoke to me but she had not been many minutes in my house before she fainted she fainted three times after this King came into my house - the prosecutrix was bleeding at the time King said to her Do you say I robbed you do you say I gave you that black eye and immediately struck her in the face and made her mouth bleed - it had not bled before the prosecutirx could not answer her - she had just recovered from a fainting fit one of her ears was torn right through the flesh - she did not appear to me to be intoxicated she spoke so collected she was very much exhausted indeed - I had no doubt she had been drinking Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Why have you no doubt of that A Because I saw liquor go into the house once or twice I did not think her intoxicated I swear I thought her sober quite so - my son and husband came in and saw her there are a great many had houses in that street - this is one and No 18 also which Samuel Howarth keeps I never saw Elliss before I follow no business - my husband has a small workshop in the house and supplies tool-makers I have lived there three years and a half Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Does your son live with you A yes - he is not married a woman led him away but he never lived in my house with her he does not live with her now - we are always talking to him about it Elliss did not go into Howarth s house but into mine - Murray came in with her COURT Q When Wilson came out and said what you state did she add For saying I have robbed her A Yes and she said so twice in my house JAMES BROOKS I am a Policeman I went to Mrs Gibbons house about five o clock and saw Elliss all over blood bleeding profusely from her eyes and ears the blood was running down profusely - she appeared agitated and very weak from the loss of blood in consequence of what I heard I went to No 7 Francis-street tried to open the door and found it locked - I heard either a lock or window fastened while I was attempting to get in I staid there a quarter of an hour - other constables came and it was opened I had required that it should be opened when I first went but it was not - I found the prisoners there and took them into custody they said they were innocent Henson s Defence I called at Wilson s that morning and had not been there long before Ellis came in I did not know her before and went into the kitchen - she persuaded me to come into the parlour and sent for half a pint of gin- Murray came in and she sent for another half pint there were four half pints sent for - that is all I know MARY GIBBS I live in Shepherd s-walk City-road and am a laundress I have known Elliss about eight months and wash for her she told me she was very sorry for Henson and she hoped it would be favourable with him - she did not say who robbed her I once asked if it was Henson had robbed her she certainly said she thought he never did rob her - I have seen Murray twice since this- she asked me if Henson had property and said she had made inquiry and was told he had I said he was a hardworking man and what he got was by industry I have known him sixteen years - his father is a gingerbread baker next door to me he always bore an honest character MR PHILLIPS Q Did you ever know he was master of the house in Francis-street A No he was not - he lived at his father s I heard of his being taken on the Wednesday or Thursday as this happened on Monday - I went to Elliss and begged her to be as favourable as she could to him and she said she did not wish to hurt him but she must tell the truth - she said she had been robbed but could not tell where the money went or which of them had robbed her I saw a mark on her face and she had a black eye ELIZA HOWARD I am ten years old and live at No 3 Francis-street I remember the disturbance at No 7 - Miss Elliss sent me to fetch the best gin that day about ten o clock - I got sixpenny worth at a time that is a quartern and a half - she gave Wilson the money for it and Wilson gave it to me with a decanter to get it in not a green bottle I got it from Shepherd s public-house in Old-street-road - I went for gin ten or eleven times for her I received the money from Wilson and once from King - Elliss gave it to King to give me I am almost sure it was eleven times - it was ten or eleven I changed half a sovereign in the morning the first time and paid 6d each time - Elliss gave the money for it each time I got the same quantity each time - the last was about four o clock MR PHILLIPS Q How did you happen to go to the house A Wilson called me - I did not know her before- she did not pay me for going when she wanted gin she called me from her mother s from her own door - welive four houses from Wilson s - my mother was next door- I could hear Wilson call me she said Betsey will you fetch me an errand she said so each time - she called loud enough for my mother to hear I had spoken to Wilson before - Wilson called me and Elliss gave me the half-sovereign - the solicitor has been talking to me about the evidence I was to give he was not half an hour talking to me - he did not tell me I must have gone ten or eleven times for the gin he said Well my little maid how much gin did you fetch I told him eleven times - he did not ask me any thing more my mother and Mr Howarth were present - he gave me 1s with a piece of paper I never saw Ellis at the house before - a girl at the public-house gave me change for the half-sovereign - she has gone away not the public-house is about ten minutes walk from Francis-street I never changed half a sovereign before only for my mother - I had 9s 6d out of I - if 1s was taken out of the half-sovereign there would be 8s 6d left if I had had 2s worth of gin I should have had 7s change - if 3s were taken from a half-sovereign there would be 6s left MR CLARKSON Q How many shillings does half a sovereign amount to A Ten - if I take 3s from 10s there would be 6s left if I took 6d from half a sovereign there would be 8s 6d left - I got 8s 6d change out of the half-sovereign not 9s 6d COURT Q Had you ever been to the public-house before for the people at No 7 A Three or four times - I went eleven times that day for Elliss my mother knew I went once or twice she scolded me once for it when I had been about nine times ELIZA HOWARD I am this child s mother On the day in question I was washing next door but one round the corner I left my daughter at home - I went about seven o clock and returned about twelve I scolded my daughter for fetching gin for Miss Wilson King and the rest - I knew she had fetched it because I saw her pass the house I was working at - I saw her pass I should think eight or nine times before twelve o clock - I chided her for going so often and said she should not go there so much she did not tell me how often she had been but I could see every time she went - I called her in once and told her if she went again I should be very angry and after that I saw her go again - I should think the last time I saw her go must have been between three and four o clock - I should think she went ten or twelve times in all MR PHILLIPS Q Of course you never knew of her taking gin to a brothel before A Yes children were in the habit of running on errands for the neighbours - I never knew of her fetching gin for that house before she passed at least eight or nine times before twelve o clock - she might have fetched gin for Wilson before Elliss arrived - Elliss was there before twelve o clock I am sure the child fetched gin at least eight or nine times before twelve - the public-house is not more than two minutes walk I should think it is about one hundred yards - I have sent her out to change as much as half a crown at times but never sent her with any gold - she never had any gold to my knowledge till she changed this half-sovereign for Wilson it was about half-past eleven or twelve o clock when I called her in and scolded her - she had gone eight or mine times then she went backwards and forwards as fast as she could - I saw her every time she went I chastised her three or four different times - being a poor woman if a child can earn a halfpenny I am glad of it and I suppose in the course of this day she might have received 3d or 4d for going for the gin MR CLARKSON Q Did she show you any thing she had for going A Yes 3d or 4d when she had the money she gave it to me to keep COURT Q Your saw 3d or 4d which she had A Yes Wilson keeps the house I have seen Henson passing several times - his father keeps a shop in the City-road - every time my child had a half-penny she brought it to me and it amounted to 3d or 4d a halfpenny at a time Henson received a very good character HENSON - GUILTY Aged 21 Confined Twelve Months KING -

t18301028-116  1956 LOUISA INSKIP was indicted for feloniously assaulting Henry George Steer on the 7th of October putting him in fear and taking from his person and against his will 1 watch value 4l 1 watch-guard value 6d 1 handkerchief value 2s 4 half-crowns 7 shillings and 1 sixpence his property HENRY GEORGE STEER I live in Henry-street Lambeth and am a boot and shoemaker On the 7th of October about three o clock in the morning I was in Farringdon-street - I had been to a party at Whitechapel and was not sober but knew what I was about I had been with my brother and friends - I thought it not safe to go home over London-bridge I was alone and when I had got twelve or eighteen houses down Farringdon-street out of Smithfield a man ran out of some place struck me a blow in the side and knocked me down - he came from a street on the left-hand side he came out so suddenly I did not observe what turning he came from - he was alone and after that I got up and he ran away I had a gold watch three gold seals and a key protected by a guard round my neck four half-crowns and 7s 6d in silver in my pocket when I got into Farringdon-street - I cannot say whether the man took any of my money or my handkerchief I should think I was two or three minutes on the ground and am certain that when I got up I had my watch safe - when I got up two women crossed over the way as I thought to render me assistance they came to me - I could not recognize their persons one was short and the other tall - I cannot say whether the prisoner was one one of them said to me You are very dirty - I said Yes I have just been knocked down one put her arm round my neck and the other snatched my watch from my fob - I had hurt my knee very much with the fall and could not run but I followed them down Fieldlane as they went that way when I got up there I lost sight of them - I met a Policeman at the corner of West-street and told him what had happened he told me to follow him which I did - I lost sight of him for a minute or two and while I was looking about another Policeman came up and I went with him to the station-house Clerkenwell I there saw the prisoner and my watch - I had got the seals and chain in my hand in the struggle and kept them - the guard broke and they only got the watch the woman who put her hand round my neck pretended to brush the dirt off - I have not seen the other woman since nor the man who knocked me down Cross-examined by MR CHURCHILL Q At what time had you left your friends A About half-past two o clock I had not looked at my watch I came direct from Whitechapel - I did not mean to cross the bridge and came across Bishopsgate-street down Sun-street Finsbury and across Smithfield that was not out of the way to go over Blackfriars-bridge - I do not think Cornhill would have been the straightest way I called at no public-house on the road - I was not at the Red Lion in Poppin s-court I did not say I lived in Kennington-lane at the station-house- I wrote my address there I was rather elevated - I noticed as the man ran away that he had a brown coat on he knocked me down with his fist - he either came out of a house or a street THOMAS SARSFIELD I am a Policeman I saw the prosecutor about half-past three o clock in West-street at the corner of Field-lane - he complained of having been robbed by two women I had just met the prisoner and another woman going through Black Boy-alley which leads into West-street - I let them go on and when I came to the bottom I met Steer who told me he had been robbed of a gold watch I then went after them - they had got nearly two hundred yards as far as Turnmill-street I laid hold of them both by each hand and the prisoner dropped the watch which I now produce - I am quite sure I saw her drop it I picked it up and held her till another constable came - we took them to the station and they were both committed the bill against the other has been thrown out - I sent another constable to look for Steer he came to the station and claimed the watch directly he saw it - he was rather in liquor but not insensible he spoke rationally - he identified it again at the Mansion-house I gave it to the inspector to lock up but I put my mark on it first and am certain this is the same Cross-examined Q Are you sure of it A I have my mark on it and I took the No 2154 - the prosecutor did not describe it before he saw it - he had said it was a gold watch he could walk as steady as I could - he stated he had been robbed in Farringdon-street and I found the prisoner about four hundred yard from there H G STEER This is my watch - I bought it about nine months ago of my brother it is worth 4l Cross-examined Q I think you said you did not meet any women in you walk A Not to speak to them - none of them touched me I am quite sure none of them surrounded me - they may have said Good night or so but I said nothing to them I am a married man JOHN SHACKLOCK I am a Policeman I was coming through Black-boy-alley about half-past three o clock and met the prisoner and another woman - the tall one said to the short one I thought he would have knocked you down the short one replied I thought he would - we went on the corner of Field-lane and met Steer who said he had lost a gold watch we returned and took both the women in Turnmill-street I saw Sarsfield stoop and pick up a watch when I took them - he took it to the station-house where Steer identified it - he was sober enough to describe what had passed Cross-examined Q How were the women standing when he picked something up A He had seized them both and they stood rather against the wall the prisoner appeared to have dropped something her right hand was to the wall - I did not see her drop it GUILTY of stealing from the person but not with force and violence Aged 20 - Transported for Seven Years 
t18301209-90  Third Middlesex Jury before Mr Baron Vaughan 90 HENRY HART and JOHN LEE were indicted for feloniously assaulting William Anderson on the 15th of November putting him in fear and taking from his person and against his will 18s his monies WILLIAM ANDERSON I live in Cannon-street-road and am a manufacturer of sealing-wax and wafers On the 15th of November at two o clock in the morning I was at Morris public-house Whitechapel and saw Hart there I had only gone in to have a glass of rum and shrub - I was out in about two minutes he wished me to treat him in the house - I refused and went out directly I got my change he followed me immediately at three or four yards distance - and on going through Spectacle-alley which is about six houses further I looked round and saw both the prisoners in company they approached me but said nothing when I got to the end of the court I looked round not liking to be molested as they came round me and hustled me about I was obstructed by them - I looked round did not like their appearance and walked on - they followed me still quicker four or five doors further to a board in the street and there one of them was close on my left and the other close behind me I cannot say which - I was in the act of turning to look at the other and found myself momentarily on my back in the mud I was thrown down by a person s leg being put out to obstruct me - I fell right backwards after I was down one said to the other Here is a gentleman in the mud let us pick him up - I cannot say which that was they lifted me up as any friend would do and then one said to the other Let us scrape him down - they did so I thanked them for their friendly services and then walked on towards the Commercial-road-in Church-street they continued walking on one side of me they would have laid hold of my arms but I would not allow it - I am in the habit of walking with my hands in my pockets I put my hand into my pocket and they seeing me do so ran off immediately - I did not at that time know I had lost any thing when they had got about a dozen yards up Dock-alley I found they had got my purse which contained 18s as near as I am able to estimate - I had taken it out in the public-house returned it to my pocket and walked some way with my hand in my pocket I am certain I had it safe after leaving the public-house - I then pursued them down several courts and streets I lost sight of them - when I came up the Policeman had taken them about a minute and a half - they were not out of my sight above half a minute I came up and said I give charge of these two men - they have just robbed me they were searched in my presence and about 13s or 14s I believe found on them Hart had most of it - only a few sixpences were found on Lee in his watch-pocket I saw my purse in the Policeman s hands - he had picked it up just before I came up Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Where had you been to A To my uncle s at Lambeth - I was not aware that it was so late I went there to tea about five o clock - I had been to no other public-house that evening I was not perfectly sober I was not drunk - I should not have fallen if a foot had not been put out I should not fall from drunkenness - I do not think any body was with me but the prisoners Q Why did you thank them for their kindness if you was thrown in the mud A I was so surrounded with mud if I had moved I should have been covered - I did not like to charge them with it they walked as far as Plummer s-row about thirty houses after that - I was not aware that they had robbed me I saw no watchman to inform of it - I had not presence of mind to return to the public-house I am quite satisfied I had 18s in my purse - this was a night-house I was neither drunk nor sober - I had the rum and shrub because I felt cold and am subject to take cold and had no great coat I was not violent at the watch-house and did not want to fight the prisoners - I was quiet there 14s was found on Hart COURT Q What sort of a night was it - was the court lighted with gas A No - I could hardly see my hand before me in the court ROBERT CAMPPEN I am a Policeman On the 15th of November about a quarter or twenty minutes past two o clock I saw two persons run down King-street and at the corner of Battie-street I stopped the two prisoners - that is about thirty yards from King-street there is a court half-way down King-street - I stopped at the end of King-street I suppose they saw me and ran down the court - I think it is Well-court I heard one say to the other Through this court - they ran through it it leads into Battie-street - I made for Battie-street and at the corner of Battie-street seeing them running at that hour in the morning I took them into custody with the assistance of a brother officer and in a minute or a minute and a half I saw the prosecutor - he came up while I was asking why they were running and stated that he had been robbed by two men I said I had stopped two - he immediately identified them as the persons who had robbed him I searched them and found 11s 6d in silver and 8d in copper on Hart - I was present when a sixpence was found on Lee my brother-officer and Elliott brought the purse up about two minutes after I took them just as the prosecutor came up and said he had picked it up at the corner of Greenfield-street Commercial-road which is across the Commercial-road on the opposite side - a person coming from the court I saw them in would not be in Greenfield-street but I did not see them till they ran out of the Commercial-road into King-street they could pass Greenfield-street between that and where the robbery was committed - the prosecutor claimed the purse he was certainly not sober - he had been drinking but was quite capable of taking care of himself and know what passed Cross-examined Q Was there any money in the purse A No - 12s 8d was found altogether on the prisoners Q Was not the prosecutor in such a state that he might easily mistake a man A If there was no gas-light there there was one very near to where he was robbed which I should think is about sixty yards from Morris house the Yorkshire Grey he pointed the place out to me - there is a light within ten or twelve yards of it it was not a very dark night - I have seen it lighter it was not moonlight I will not swear the men I first saw running were the prisoners - they were running towards me ROBERT ELLIOTT I am a Policeman On the morning of the 15th I was in Greenfield-street Commercial-road I heard a shuffling and sort of running noise which excited my suspicion it proceeded from the Commercial-road - I did not see the persons till I came up to them in Battie-street- the place where I heard the noise is in a straight direction from the spot the prosecutor describes himself to have been robbed I saw no other person there nor any person running - I lost the sound all at once when I came up to the top of Greenfield-street I found the purse laying under a lamp at the corner of Greenfield-street and the Commercial-road - I took it up and have it here immediately on taking it up I heard a noise in Battie-street like five or six persons talking - I went there and found the prisoners in custody the prosecutor came up at the same time - I saw them searched sixpence was found on Lee and 11s 6d and 8d on Hart - the prosecutor was evidently the worse for liquor but quite capable of taking care of himself he claimed the purse immediately he saw it - I asked the colour and he told me before I showed it to him Cross-examined Q There was no silver in the purse A No the prosecutor might certainly make a mistake in the person of a man Hart s Defence I met Lee in Ratcliff-highway - we were going home and as we went along we were taken into custody by two Policemen - the gentleman came up and said These men have robbed me of a watch seals and 2l at the station-house he said he had lost 24s but not his watch he afterwards said it was 26s he said this in the Policemen s presence and at the station he said Are you two Jews I said Yes - he said Come out of doors and I will fight you the Policeman brought him away and said You must not fight here he said You d-d rascals I will do any thing to you ROBERT CAMPPEN The prosecutor said he had no doubt had it not been for his guard his watch would have been gone and that he had lost about 1l he did not challenge them to fight at all nor did I interfere to prevent it- I never left them together out of my presence HART -

I was on the pavement and saw four or five men in the road they came up to me as I was passing - they surrounded me and stopped me - Reuben held my left arm behind me - they closed round me and felt round my pockets - my money was in my waistcoat pocket they did not get that as it happened but they tore my trousers in both flaps in attempting to get my money it was done roughly and with a degree of violence - it appeared to me done with a view to get my money Rowley was taken on the spot and had been one of those pressing against me - they were all entire strangers the prisoners were both taken on the spot - I gave Reuben in charge for attempting to rob me and I really believe they did so - it was their intention I did not lose sight of Reuben till he got to the station-house - Rowley was taken before the parties had time to separate he had hold of me when the officer came up - when he came up they let go and attempted to shove me off the pavement into the horse-road Cross-examined by MR STURGEON Q Had Reul en hold of you A Yes both of them Rowley was the first taken off me by the officer but Reuben took held of me first -

I had part of two pots of beer and half a pint of gin I was a little in liquor - I was perfectly sensible of what was going on I am sure I did not jostle up against Reuben - it was about twelve o clock at night I had part of two pots of beer and half a pint of gin among four people - I had no more it was not a crowded place - the street was clear I saw only five or six people - I told the Magistrate the same story I do not know that I made any alteration in my deposition - I will not swear about it what I state is the truth - I believe there was an alteration in one word about the hand being in or out of my pocket but if their hands had not been in my pockets the flaps of my trousers would not have been torn I was not drunk when I went before the Magistrate - I thought I had been robbed and said so before I got to the station but when I got there I said I had not I there found my money was correct - the Magistrate put a question to me which I do not recollect when I altered the deposition he said he me Why not say whether the hand was in the pocket or out of it I consider they were both in and out by tearing them in this manner - he asked me whether I had been biased by the prisoners and if I had received any money of them for not appearing on the Monday I did not appear till the Wednesday when I was fetched by the Police-officer - I am a labouring man I have never been in trouble DENNIS POWER I am a Police-serjeant On Saturday the 1st of January at twelve o clock at night I was on duty in Went worth-street - George-street turns out of it in turning from there into Wentworth-street I saw the prosecutor and some persons round him - I ran up and saw both the prisoners Rowley was on his right side and Reuben on his left - Rowley had his left hand behind the prosecutor - Reuben had his right hand behind the prosecutor and was holding his hands behind him his left hand was about his pockets it appeared to me at the moment that they intended to rob him - I ran up immediately on my going up they shoved the prosecutor right out into the road off the pavement - I took Rowley before the prosecutor spoke the prosecutor then pointed to Reuben and said There is one of them a Police-constable was coming down the street and he took Reuben - there was a gas-lamp about fifteen yards off which gave me a view of the features of the two prisoners I had frequently seen them before and knew their persons - I did not lose sight of either of them till we got to the station the other men ran off immediately - the prosecutor had been drinking a little but he appeared to know what he was doing Cross-examined Q Had not Reuben an opportunity of running away A I cannot answer that - there was one constable behind him and another before him whohad him in custody in a few moments I was twelve or fourteen yards from them when I first saw them - I did not take particular notice of the night but I had sufficient light to distinguish four Reuben s left hand was on or in the prosecutor s left trousers pocket and his right hand behind his back - I was present when the deposition was taken before the Magistrate I did not take particular notice of what the Magistrate said - there might be an alteration made in the deposition and I not see it it is an extensive office - I do not recollect hearing of any alteration I gave my evidence and thought that was sufficient - that was on the Wednesday I had been after the prosecutor on the Monday but did not see him - I believe I went again on the Tuesday night and again on the Wednesday I believe the prisoners were brought up three times - I was here some time back but I do not now recollect what expences I got I am not aware of receiving any thing on a conviction COURT Q Is there any reward on the conviction of a prisoner A There is not my Lord GEORGE PERRIOR I am a Police-officer On the 1st of January about twelve o clock I came up I saw Reuben walking away from the prosecutor -

he had been drinking but was far from being intoxicated Cross-examined Q If Reuben had been inclined to escape might he not A Impossible I was about five yards from him - he did not attempt to escape or to resist I must have been present at the examination but I saw no alteration made nor heard of any -

I had a sovereign and 6d about me at that time I do not know what he did with the shilling - he said he had spent it and asked me to lend him two more I was a good while before I agreed but he kept bothering so I went and got change at the bar for the purpose of lending him two more which I did I had called for some beer to be sent into the tap-room and after I got in they backed themselves up against the door - Thomas and William Sawyer Thomas Flood and John Taylor stood against the door Budd did not touch me at that time - I was sober as soon as I went into the tap-room William Sawyer came up to me and snatched the ribbon of my hat and after that he snatched a knife off my neck cut the string and took it away - it hung to my neck by a string I asked him to give me my knife back again and my ribbon - he would not I told him to let me out of the tap-room they were all standing against the door and William Sawyer gave me a shove and shoved me out of the tap-room - when I asked them to let me out Thomas Sawyer took me up in his arms and carried me out into the skittle-ground the others had followed him out - Thomas Sawyer threw me down against the dust-hole in the skittle-ground John Taylor and William Sawyer came up to me - Taylor was sitting on the publican s barrow under the shed William Sawyer came up and took hold of me by the thigh of my trousers - he took me up and threw me down again the others at this time were in the shed -

Flood asked somebody who stood round the pailing to lend hima knife one was handed round into the shed to him - I could not see by whom but I saw it was a white-handled penknife Q What was William Sawyer and Budd doing when Taylor had his hands round your mouth and his knees over your shoulders A I saw Budd holding my pocket out while Flood cut it out - I did not see William Sawyer at that time I lost the money which was in my pocket about 15s a few halfpence and part of the waistband of my trousers - I saw Budd with my fob and part of the waisthand in his hand I saw him give Taylor the pocket with the money in it - Taylor went out with it and I followed him into the White Horse public-house and asked him for my money he asked what money I meant - I said he knew what money I wanted the money he had taken out of my pocket I shut the door - he opened it and followed me out - he came as far as Mr Stauley s the butcher s and then knocked me down when I got up I saw William Sawyer and he knocked me down again - that was the first time I had seen him after he was in the shed I went the same evening before the Justice - I did not see Taylor and Thomas Sawyer again till Monday morning I knew them to be two of the men whom I had seen on the 9th Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You must have got rid of 5s out of the sovereign A I paid for eight pots of beer for them -

I am sure that was the only time I lived once with a gentleman named Tuck I did not go from his service to the House of Correction - I was put there for climbing over a hedge it was for breaking the hedge down Q And taking some wood I believe A No I had none of the wood - I was with the party that had it at least I was in one field and they in the other I was in the House of Correction two months on that charge - that is the only time I was ever in trouble I was not in the House of Correction three weeks for stealing potatoes -

when they had cut off the pocket they both walked away Grimes got up said he was robbed and they all walked out of the yard - I followed them and Grimes followed me- Budd was sitting on a form in the skittle-ground at the time they were cutting the pocket off it was done with a white-handled knife Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q If Grimes has sworn that when Flood was cutting off the pocket Budd was holding it out for him is there a single word of truth in it A Budd was not there then - he had nothing to do with cutting the pocket I should suppose he was nearly twenty yards from Flood at that time - I was sober- I went there as Gapps son was going in and called me to play at skittles Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q How many persons were in the skittle-ground besides these men A I saw nobody besides Gapps son and the prisoners - we were not looking on Gapps son went to the shed to look for the ball and could not find it - I went to look for it then and saw this happen my mind was not directed to a robbery at first - I never saw men lark in that way Grimes was on the ground he was not asleep - I do not think he was tipsy I will not swear he was sober - I heard him say he was robbed he did not appear to have been drinking I am no particular judge of a drunken man - he walked out of the yard very straight FREDERICK SMITH I am pot-boy at the Three Tons On the 9th of April Grimes was at the house I saw William Sawyer in the skittle-ground also Taylor and Budd I saw William Sawyer go to Grimes pull out his knife and attempt to cut off his pocket with the knife I did not see Taylor do any thing but he was in the place -

I was asking the reason of the disturbance when my father came up and by our advice he went to Mr Mores - I should say he was sober when I saw him Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Whether they were quarrelling or larking you cannot say A It did not appear a lark - he appeared perfectly sober when he came to me and quite overcome with grief Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q So sober it must be impossible but he could tell whether a man was twenty yards from him or cutting his pocket A I know nothing of that -

to the best of my recollection there were two men and four women the prisoner Field was one of them - it was not very dark and there was a lamp at a short distance I had never seen him before - as I was about to pass them the men seized me by the arms forced me against the wall of a house and kept me there the others began to rifle my pockets - they took a black leather pocketbook out of my left-hand trousers pocket containing a 20l a 10l and a 5l Bank note and a guard-chain from round my neck my watch was not attached to it - it was made of silk and had gold beads fixed to it they took a snuff box eight sovereigns and sixteen or seventeen shillings from my right-hand trousers pocket - I had accidentally torn one corner of the 10l note off but cannot say at which end I folded the torn part in the rest and had the whole note - my hat was also taken off this did not last more than three or four minutes I should think - I had drank a little rum-and-water after supper but was perfectly sober I called Murder and Police a person immediately put his hand before my mouth and I could not halloo - they tore my coat with pulling my hands from holding my pocket they dispersed when they had got my money - it happened near the Bishopsgate-street end of Rose-lane I am certain Field is the man who held my left arm - I do not know Meeking I have seen none of the property except the chain - no blows were struck Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Have you always sworn that Field held your arm A I swore he was one of the party that held me I do not know that I mentioned my arm - I swore to him at the first examination I gave the name of Donald McTavish at the first examination - I was not asked my name before I was sworn having shortly come from Scotland I thought my name being inserted in the reports might distress my friends -Mc Tavish was my mother s name I gave my real name before my evidence was read over to me and told the Magistrate my reason for giving the first name I had been three days in London - I went straight home after the robbery I went to no public-house but after the robbery as I was going home one of the robbers followed me and asked if I had any more money as he wanted something to drink - I was in fear of my life at the moment and glad to get away on any condition I had a few halfpence left and gave them to him - I should know him again but have never seen him since I gave nobody any thing else - I do not know the Queen s Head in Fashion-street Q Did you not sit yourself down on the step of a door instead of going home A I did not except at the time they robbed me it happened about half-past one o clock - I had dined at my lodging in Wormwood-street at five and had a glass of warm rum-and-water and perhaps a glass of porter I left home at half-past nine - I am not well acquainted with town I went to call on a Mr Ross who was ill - he lives near Finsbury-square I did not know his house - I was directed to a baker who showed it to me I cannot remember whether I drank any thing there - I swear I did not drink a bottle of wine there I do not think I took any thing - I left about half-past eleven o clock and was going to a Mr McDonald in the Commercial-road but could not find his house I then returned directly home - I went to a tavern in Fenchurch-street before I went to Mr Ross and may have had two glasses of rum-and-water there I could swear it was not three - I only paid 1s there I was at no other public-house - I drank nothing at Mr Ross to the best of my recollection and am sure I had no wine I did not state at the office that I was intoxicated - I denied that I was I swear I was not on the step of a door except when these people were holding me COURT Q How many times were you at the office A Five - my examination was written down the last time I gave my right name at the second examination MARIA JOHNSON I live in Rose-lane On Sunday morning the 14th of August I got out of bed to let a lodger in I do not know what time it was - the prisoners lived three or four doors from me on the other side of the way in the same house but I do not know that they live together when I got up I saw five or six people standing over the way and heard a gentleman ask for his hat - I saw the prisoners coming to the mob they were about half a yard from the person who asked for his hat -I left them went to bed and next day about one or two o clock I saw Meeking with a necklace round her neck it was silk or hair - I saw beads on it I have seen the guard - it was such a thing as that I never saw her with such a thing before SARAH JOHNSON I am the last witness mother I got up about half-past one or two o clock when this took place - I let the lodger in myself my daughter was up- I saw both the prisoners in the street there were four or five other people altogether - I saw them doing nothing but hanging over a man I do not know who it was - I cannot say whether it was the prosecutor they were stooping towards him - he was sitting on the step as near as I could judge while they were hanging over him MARY WARD I saw these people in the street that night - the prisoner were among them I think it was about half-past one o clock - I cannot say what the people were doing I was only looking through the window- there were a great many people there Cross-examined Q Were not the prisoner at some distance from the gentleman A There might be seven or eight people standing and they were among them JOSEPH ALLEN I live in Wentworth-street - I saw the people in Rose-lane standing round a gentleman who was rather intoxicated I saw one lift up his arm - I do not know who it was as it was dark I did not see them take any thing - I saw one man with a brown guard-chain in his hand it was just like the one produced - the gentleman had no bat on he was asleep on the step of a door when I saw him - five or six were round him he appeared to be asleep because his hands were on his face and his elbows on his knees he made no noise nor resistance - he appeared to be asleep - I was coming home and met Reynolds he and I went up and saw this Cross-examined Q Did any body come up after you A No I have known Field some years - I saw him come up backwards and forwards two or three times I did not see him take any thing from the man but we kept at a distance from them - I did not rouse the man as there were five or six they might have struck me or something COURT Q Your only reason for saying he was asleep is because he sat with his hands on his face A Yes I saw the female prisoner there THOMAS REYNOLDS I am a butcher and was with Allen - I know the prisoners well by sight I saw them both there - there were four more men but I saw no other woman I did not see the transaction till I saw the prosecutor sitting on a step - he had no hat on he was rather in liquor I think and asleep - these people were round him I saw one of them take the guard off his neck while he sat in that state - he did not resist he appeared fast asleep - I do not know who took it the prisoners might be a yard or a yard and a half from the man who took it Cross-examined Q He made no sign that he knew they were taking the guard No - they lifted his head back and took the guard off but he never spoke he was between asleep and awake - Allen and I were about the same distance as the prisoners but they were there before us I cannot say whether Field took the guard off or not- I gave no alarm I wanted to get home HENRY KENNY On the night in question I was in Fashion-street near Rose-lane I heard a person cry Robbery and Murder I ran into Rose-lane and saw the prosecutor standing up with a parcel of women holding his hands there were four or five women I suppose - they were encouraging each other to take something out of his pocket there was no man there that I particularly noticed at that moment but there might have been I do not know whether Meeking was there when I got there I picked up a hat and put it on the gentleman s head it was laying in the kennel - I turned round and saw a person very much like Field with a black pocket-book in his hand he opened it shook it and said My friends there arn t a bl-y mag in it he and another man enticed the prosecutor up to the top of Fashion-street and asked him for something to drink they brought him up to the door of a private house and said This is a public-house let us have something to drink the prosecutor put his hands into his pockets and gave them three or four halfpence I think it was the prisoner took them - they both said Good night my friend I did not see them do any thing to his pockets Cross-examined Q Are you sure it was to two men he gave the halfpence A There were two men together - I was not at the Queen s Head I swear I never said Field was not the man - he is as much like the man as I ever saw I never said the prosecutor offered me 5l to swear to Field - I said if I could swear to him the inspector would make it as good as 5l to me the inspector of the Police told me so CHARLES VANDERSTEIN I know the prisoner Field - he came to me about a fornight ago last Saturday and asked if I could change a 10l note I looked at it - it was very much rumpled it was a Bank note and the lefthand corner was torn off I did not change it thinking itwas not a good note I returned it to him -

t18310908-60  First London Jury before Mr Recorder 1588 WILLIAM BAKER was indicted for feloniously assaulting John Barrowcliff on the 1st of August putting him in fear and taking from his person and against his will 1 purse value 6d 38 sovereigns and 2 half-sovereigns his property JOHN BARROWCLIFF I am an upholsterer and live in Fleet-street On the 1st of August about seven o clock in the evening I was on the left-hand side of Blackfriarsbridge on the London side - it was the day London-bridge was opened I had three children with me - I had twelve 5l Bank-notes thirty-eight sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in my purse and one sovereign loose in my pocket the Bank notes were in my breast pocket - I did not lose them the gold was in my left-hand breeches pocket -I opened my purse on my way to the bridge and at that time put the notes into my breast pocket I buttoned up my pocket tight a few minutes before I got to the bridge and the moment I got there - I was on the top of the step- I and my childern were surrounded and the prisoner who was among a number of others who surrounded me pressed between me and my little child got between up and separated us - their pressing against me drew my attention from my pocket - I preceived my pocket much lighter than it was I put my hand to it and the purse and money were gone - one of my childern saw the loose sovereign on the steps I am sure at least six persons surrounded me - I am certain of the prisoner he was under my left arm directly at the side of my pocket from which the sovereigns were taken - I told my eldest child to take care of the childern while I followed the prisoner who I was sure had robbed me I followed him at a few yards distance as near as the crowd would let me and was looking out for an officer - the moment I saw one I gave him in charge he might have gone one hunderd yards from where I was robbed I have not found my purse or money- he said nothing to the charge I took my eldest daughter to the Computer to see him a few hours after Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How many other persons were on the bridge A It was covered - my attention was exclusively directed to the prisoner after I was beset my attention was directed to six persons - I have sworn to another person before the Alderman I only swore that to the best of my belief that person wasamong the six who beset me - I believe that person to be a witness here he has served me with a copy of a writ to sue me for damages - I have not a doubt he is the person I took him for now I only swore to him to the best of my belief - I did not swear to him positively I swear positively to the prisoner - the prisoner last night called that person Thomas Bickerton and got his trial put off to have him here a copy of a writ was served on me - I did not read it but took it to my solicitor I have been told the person has one or two names - he went by the name of Wilson at the lock-up house I kept my eye on the prisoner from the time I was robbed till he was taken which was in about four minutes and he was attempting to pick a pocket at that time - I gave him in charge and so did the person whose pocket he was attempting I did not see him do that - he could pick half a dozen pockets without my seeing him I could see his head in the crowd but not his hands Q Have you ever gone out to fish for pickpockets A Yes - I have been endeavouring to find the other five I believe I said at Guildhall that I lost upwards of thirtyfive sovereigns but have since counted my money and discovered that it was thirty-eight sovereigns and two half-sovereigns - I never swore I lost forty sovereigns I should recollect three of the others if I saw them twelve months hence - Bickerton was one of the six to the best of my recollection ELIZA BARROWCLIFF I am the prosecutor s daughter I was with him on the steps of the bridge nearest to the shore three more of my father s family were with us - they are younger than me I saw five or six men surround him - I then saw one of them get under my father s arm he was nearest to my father s person - I could not see what was done for the men pushed us directly they were gone my father said he was robbed - I looked at the persons who had left him I observed the features of the man who was under his arm before he left and am certain it was the prisoner - I saw him again at Guildhall I was not present when the constable took him - I went with my father to the Compter the same evening he was in custody there Cross-examined Q On your oath did you see that man at the Compter A Yes - I saw him at Guildhall the night of the robbery the Compter is at Guildhall - I was at Guildhall the next day I saw the prisoner the same night as the robbery but I forgot that - I was very much frightened when it happened I know the prisoner is the man- there was a great rush of people I did not have all my sisters to hold - there were three of the family with us the youngest was six years old - my father was looking after her I cannot say what handkerchief the prisoner had on JAMES HACKWELL I was sworn as a special-constable to act on the bridge I was on the bridge and saw the prisoner there - I did not see the prosecutor till after I had the prisoner who I immediately took on seeing him draw his hand from a person s pocket Mr Barrowcliff immediately came up and charged him with robbing him of a purse and sovereigns - I cannot recollect how many sovereigns he mentioned the prisoner made no answer to the charge - he was taken to the Compter examined next day and committed when I first saw him he was in company with others and went away to a person who gave him in charge and whose pocket I saw him draw his hand out of he was searched but nothing was found on him -I had not seen him near the prosecutor Cross-examined Q How came you to be sworn in A Because I applied for it - I was a constable of Bow-street but not a regular one I hold two Bow-street warrants now - I was transferred to the new Police and was charged with being drunk but it was not true - I was dismissed I heard Mr Barrowcliff make a charge against a person who he thought was one of the men but I did not attend to what he said as that was not a case of mine I dare say there were a thousand people on the bridge Prisoner s Defence I went to see the sight like other people the bridge was much crowded - I was taken by the officers but knew nothing of the charge RICHARD BICKERTON I hold a situation in Doctors -commans as clerk and have been there nearly twenty years I went to see His Majesty open the bridge - I did not see the prosecutor there he charged me at Guildhall as being one of the gang concerned in robbing him of forty sovereigns and somethings more - he positively stated that I was one of the party that he was positive of it I have brought on action against him - I was only a few hours in custody and discharged by the Alderman I had no knowledge of his being robbed COURT Q Do you know the prisoner A I never saw him till he was at Guildhall - I had been out that evening and was taken up as being disorderly I swear the prosecutor positively swore I was one of the gang but the Alderman discharged me - Mr Armstrong my principal came forward and gave me a twenty years character GUILTY of stealing from the person only Aged 21 Transported for Life 
t18311201-77  Before Mr Justice Bosanquet 77 JOHN SMITH was indicted for feloniously assaulting Thomas Ryder on the 30th of October putting him in fear and taking from his person and against his will 3 half-crowns his monies THOMAS RYDER I am a book-binder and live in Whitecross-street On Saturday night the 29th of October I was returning from Clare-market and near the Cat public-house Beech-street I saw the prisoner and two others sky-larking - the two outside ones shoved the prisoner against me he immediately thrust his hands into my pocket and took out three half-crowns and out of my left hand pocket a brown bag - I immediately collared him and said You have robbed me - I will not let you go till you have given up my money he then knocked me down with a blow on my right eye and fell with me as I did not lose my hold - I called for help several times and a stranger came up I was then on the ground with the prisoner on the top of me - I said I shan t give him up to you - I doubt whether you are not one of his palls an officer directly came up and took him from me I had not let him out of my hands till then - I told the Policeman he had robbed me of three half-crowns he said nothing and was taken to the station - my pocket was torn down about three inches and my money gone I was not exactly sober but perfectly in my senses and noticed my money safe about two minutes before I met the prisoner Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Where did you see it safe A I had my hand in my pocket and felt it I was coming from the house of call in Stanhope-street Clare-market - I am sure I lost three half-crowns and my bag but I saw him give something to one of the two before I was knocked down and he said Cut with that as quick as you can that man ran towards Golden-lane - as soon as I was down he told the prisoner to slog me I had left work at about a quarter-past ten o clock - I work in Bateman s-row Shoreditch I did not go home because I was afraid I should be too late to get to the society - I received a sovereign and a half and four half-crowns that night I gave my wife the sovereign and a half - she works at the same shop as me I did not tell her I could only give her a sovereign because I had been robbed by a woman - my pockets were unbuttoned when I was robbed I had paid 2s for a trade ticket I never said I was so drunk I did not know what I had lost GEORGE BAXTER I am a butcher and live in Hoxton I was in Beech-street and heard Watch cried several times I approached the spot and the prosecutor was holding the prisoner by the collar - another young man stood with him who when I came up said to the prisoner Down him slog the b - r slog him - they were then standing up the prisoner instantly knocked the prosecutor down - they both fell together the prosecutor underneath - I then laid hold of the prisoner and he said to the other Cut he immediately went away - I kept the prisoner till the Policeman came up and took him the prosecutor would not let him go till the Policeman took him - I saw him searched at the station and three half-crowns three sixpences and some halfpence found on him cross-examined Q As soon as the other said slog him he knocked the prosecutor down A Yes and after he was down the prisoner said cut - the prosecutor was not quite sober but sufficiently so to know what happened THOMAS ROBINSON I am an ivory-worker and live in Clerkenwell I was in Beech-street and saw the prisoner and prosecutor standing together with one or two more - when I was about twelve yards off I saw the prosecutor fall I came up and took up his hat which laid in the kennel - I then assisted in securing the prisoner in a short time the Policeman came up and took him I saw the money found on him at the station - the prosecutor was a good deal in liquor but knew what he was about Cross-examined Q He was drunk enough not to walk steady A Why the blows might have made him worse but he walked to the station without help - when I first saw them they were all standing together as I thought in conversation but when I had walked six yards further the prosecutor fell I was about eighteen yards off - I did not see his pocket picked I heard some words spoken before I got up but do not know what nor by whom - I saw one or two run away the prisoner said Let me go and let this man take me into custody - so I thought the one who ran away was assisting the prosecutor to secure the prisoner I did not hear the word cut used to my knowledge - they were standing very close together MATTHEW PEAKE I am a Policeman I was in Chiswell-street and heard a cry of Watch I proceded to the spot and the first thing I saw was the prosecutor on hisback and the prisoner over him - the prosecutor saw me and said Hold him I collared him and he asked me to let him go I refused - the prosecutor got up and said he had lost some money I said How much but do not recollect how much he said - I took him to the station and found on him three half-crowns in his left-hand waistcoat pocket three sixpences and some halfpence in his right hand pocket - the prosecutor had been drinking but appeared to know what he was about and walked steady Cross-examined Q Did you ever recollect how much he said he had lost A Never I know he mentioned a sum - I never stated that he said he had only lost one half-crown he said at the station that he had lost three-I do not know what sum he mentioned when I took the prisoner he never in my hearing said he had lost only one half-crown - the prisoner did not refuse to be searched till he said what he had lost I never told the prosecutor to stick to his story - there was a prostitute by and somebody tried to trip me up two prostitutes and a boy followed him to the station - I saw no woman within a yards or two of him when I got up Prisoner s Defence One witness has been bribed to keep away who could prove he gave his wife only a sovereign that night ANN LEE I sell fruit in Whitecross-street I do not know the prisoner I was present on this Saturday night and heard the prosecutor say he had lost half a crown - that was close against the Cat at the corner of Whitecross-street the Policeman was not there Q Who was there A I saw the prosecutor wrestling with a young man in the street the young man got away and ran away - I saw the prisoner come up to them the prosecutor was very drunk I heard him say he had lost half a crown - I followed them to the station and waited outside the door when the prosecutor got there he said he had lost three half-crowns - he staggered very much indeed JOHN TOPLEY I have known the prisoner four months I am a hawker and live in Prospect-terrace Gray s Inn-road I was at the Bull s Head Smithfield on Saturday night about twelve o clock and he called in there -

t18330103-82  Before Mr Justice James Parke 333 SAMUEL FARE alias SLEITH was indicted for feloniously assaulting Benjamin Couch Danby on the 19th of December at Enfield putting him in fear and taking from his person and against his will 2 handkerchiefs value 1s 6d 1 cigar-case value 1s 1 purse value 1s and 11s his property MR CLARKSON conducted the prosecution JOSEPH MATTHEWS I was in the service of Mrs Perry at the Crown and Horse-shoe Enfield On Wednesday the 19th of December Mr Danby came to our house - the prisoner was there among other persons they remained there till about ten minutes after eleven o clock at night I was in the tap-room when there was a difference between my master and the prisoner - master shook him and told him to get up off the bench for he should not lay there - the prisoner threatened if he pulled him up again he would knock him down I did not see him produce any thing - they had three or four pots of beer and half a pint of gin when Danby went out he staggered about and I told Fare to take care of him - he came to him when I called him - I led him over the bridge and then called to Fare who came and took hold of him and so did Cooper - Wagstaff was making water at the corner of our house he went after them - they went in a direction to Wagstaff s house I observed that the deceased had some shot and powder with him at the public house - I heard next morning that he had been murdered Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q I believe the deceased was so tipsy he fell against the pales A He went against the pales - he appeared so tipsy he was likely to fall if somebody had not held him up JOSEPH PERRY I am landlord of the Crown and Horse-shoe On the 19th of December Danby and others were at my house - in the course of the evening I went into the tap-room and saw Fare and some others laying asleep - I laid hold of Fare and told him to get up I went into the bar and heard Fare and another grumbling about my disturbing him I went in and asked him what he was grumbling about - he said if I pulled him up again he would knock me down I told him not to come into my house again he said it was a public-house and he should come when he liked - he said D-n you you would not serve me so but you think I can t pay for a pot he put his hand into his pocket and produced two shillings and a sixpence Danby produced his purse several times in the prisoner s presence and I could observe that there was money in it - it appeared to be shillings or sixpences he took a shilling out to toss with the prisoner - it did not appear to have any half-crowns in it - I could form a judgment of that by the size of the bulk I should think there were from 12s to 15s as far as I could judge - I went up stairs before they left I desired Mrs Perry not to draw them any more Cross-examined Q Fare had been drinking had he not A No I did not see him there till eight o clock I believe only one pot of beer went in - I had not seen him drinking but before they left more beer was sent in RICHARD WAGSTAFF I am a baker and live at Enfield On the night of the 19th of December I was at the Crown and Horse-shoe public-house Fare was there in the course of the evening - we came away a little after eleven o clock Johnson the prisoner Cooper and the deceased went out altogether I went with them as far as my house - we all left at the same time my house is about a hundred yards from the Crown and Horse-shoe the deceased was intoxicated they all passed me at the corner of the house Johnson and Fare led him along one on one side and the other on the other - I was behind them with Cooper we proceeded in that manner until we came to my house and there I parted with them they were going in a direction towards Sheffield s house JOHN COOPER I was at the Horse-shoe on the night of the 19th of December - I remember the party leaving the house about ten minutes after eleven o clock Fare was one and the deceased was another - Fare and Johnson led the deceased along the road after Matthews went in I was behind with Wagstaff - they went just by Wagstaff s house Wagstaff went into his house - I know Sheffield s house they did not go quite so far as there Fare and Johnson were leading him and just before they got to Sheffield s I saw a scuffie and a pushing about with them and Fare fell down - I did not go up to them - the deceased caught hold of my arm and Fare wentaway directly he got up he was not on the ground half a minute - Fare lived with his mother at the Holly-bush - I did not see which way he went I never saw any thing more of him after that - I afterwards proceeded as far as Holt White s-hill and while there I did not observe any body meddle with the deceased s pockets or turn either of them inside out Cross-examined Q Did you not state yesterday that you saw a person in Holt White s-lane take a handkerchief out of Mr Danby s pocket A That was up the lane when the man was killed Johnson took a handkerchief from his jacket COURT Q From his jacket pocket or his breast -A It was about his breast that he took it from MR BODKIN Q Was not the handkerchief taken from his jacket after he was murdered A Yes - I had been knocked into the ditch and he upon me and when I had an opportunity of seeing Johnson s knees were on Danby s body and his hands on his head it was starlight and freezing I was about three yards from Danby when the pushing took place Q Did it appear to be larking among drunken men A Yes - I did not know they were doing any harm it appeared to be larking - Sheffield s house is seven or eight yards from Wagstaff s Fare went away about a minute after Wagstaff went into his house - Wagstaff did not advise me to go home as he went in he had done so about half a minute before - he said it would be better for me to go home the prisoner was about four yards off - he could not hear that as Wagstaff did not speak loud - the prisoner had been drinking with the decased and Johnson I do not think he was at all tipsy Q Fare was thrown down with this pushing A I do not know that he was thrown down he went on the ground - I had my eye on him from the time Wagstaff went in till he fell down MR CLARKSON Q Were you able from the position you were in to tell whether he was robbed or not at that time A I cannot tell one way or the other I heard no money rattle when Johnson took the handkerchief from Danby s pocket I was near enough to hear if there was any - I was about four yards off Johnson did not produce any silver to me after the murder - there was an opportunity to rob Danby near Sheffield s house if they were disposed to do so Q Is there a passage between Wagstaff s and Sheffield s A Yes it goes up the high road it is a narrow passage by a public-house - the scuffle was in the footpath at the side of the passage the road runs two ways - there is a little road branches off into the high road that is what I call the narrow passage - the scuffling was in the footpath at the bottom of the passage about ten yards from the high road in the passage JURY Q Do you know if he kept his money in the same pocket as the handkerchief A I do not know COURT Q Was it a silk or cotton handkerchief that was taken from him A I do not know I had not hold of it it was the handkerchief which was thrown into the river the passage goes up into the road - it leads from the public-house to the chase-side road we did not go out of the road - the passage was in the course of our way JOSEPH PERRY When I saw the deceased produce his purse from time to time he always put it into his right-hand breeches pocket I am confident of that for I had seen him pull it out the day before at the Holy-bush and observed how very careful he was in putting his purse away MR BODKIN Q How late did you see him with the purse A About half-past ten o clock I am certain he then put it into his right-hand breeches pocket - I went to bed after that and cannot say whether he pulled it out again I heard he was tipsy when he left the house JOSEPH MATTHEWS I saw the deceased produce his purse after my master went away I did not notice what pocket he put it into I think it was his inner pocket I know he did not put it into any pocket in his jacket I know he put it down below JOHN COOPER re-examined by MR BODKIN Q Where Fare fell was there any ditch on the side A No It was a level ground - he fell against the fence it was on the right-hand side going along the scuffling was hugging one another pushing each other about - there was not much struggling JURY Q Did you observe who commenced the struggling A Johnson apparently Danby did not resist the struggling as offensive or troublesome - he was not in a state to resist it I cannot say whether he was sensible enough to take it as a joke - I do not think there was struggling enough to make Fare fall down they were only hugging and pushing about he was not pushed down JOHN MEAD I am a constable of Enfield On the morning of the 20th of December I received information of the murder I went to the spot and saw the deceased s body - I observed a cap and gloves in it with the body I took Fare into custody on the Thursday morning about ten minutes after eight o clock it was about half-past eight when I got home I took him at his mother s house in chase-side near the Holly-bush - if persons were going from the Crown and Horse-shoe to the Holy-bush they would pass Sheffield s house to go to the footway and along the chase-side road he would be in a direct line to his home when he was with Cooper and the deceased in the chase-side road - his mother keeps a small cottage there are two little rooms down stairs and two up stairs - she has a family but I do not know how many I did not search the cottage I took Fare to the watch-house - I searched him there and found on him four knives and 4d in halfpence a penny-piece the bowl of a tobacco-pipe some shot a key and two sixpences I have known Fare from his infancy - he had been living in different families he has lived at his mother s for some months it is my duty to attend the parish officers at Enfield - Fare was a pauper of the parish and received relief on the 19th at the poor-house I saw him there that Wednesday morning and in the afternoon I was in the committee-room with him when they gave him an order for 2s 6d - I said Give it to me Sam I passed it over to the master of the house who handed him two shillings and a sixpence in my presence - I cannot recollect whether he was in the habit of receiving relief before that when he came he applied for work or relief saying he had got no employment and he could not starve - the chairman said A youngman like you coming for relief you let yourself downvery much to come as a pauper I know he said I must have relief or starve or something like that - I showed Mr Addington the tobacco-pipe bowl Watkins searched his mother s house - I took a key from him which I applied to a box at his mother s house in company with Watkins it opened the box Cross-examined Q Have you been in the habit of attending the committee when giving relief A Yes for some years persons sometimes get relief who are not really in want MR CLARKSON Q Are you not sure he said he must have relief for he could not starve A Yes I am sorry to say that is a remark too often made RICHARD WATKINS I am a Bow-street horse-patrol I received information of the murder and Fare Johnson and Cooper were apprehended I saw the body at the Serjeant - I did not notice the cap and gloves - I went and searched the prisoner s house while he was taken to the watch-house by Mead - I found a box in the house and asked his mother a question about it she gave me an answer in consequence of which I broke open the box and found in it 11s and two duplicates - Mead and I afterwards applied a key to that box which opened it - I had not the key when Mead took Fare - Mead afterwards produced it I had opened the box in Mead s absence and found in it 11s all in shillings - it was scattered about loose in the box a little distance apart as if it had been dropped in there was nothing else in the box but a few old buttons - I produced the key before the Coroner - I do not know whether what the prisoner said was taken down - he was examined as a witness - a person was writing - I am sure the key Mead produced fitted the box Cross-examined Q There are several persons living in this cottage A I believe they are all one family I do not know how many there are in family JOHN MEAD It was the key I found in the prisoner s possession which unlocked the box WILLIAM WHEELER I am a labourer and live at Enfield-chase On Thursday morning the 20th of December at half-past five o clock I was going to work as I passed down Holt White s-lane I found a corpse I got assistance and came back to the spot I found the body had been murdered I found a cap on the spot with a pair of gloves some shot and two halfpence laid close to the body - it was brought down to the Serjeant public-house and taken possession of by Mead the deceased s left-hand trowsers pocket was turned inside out the right hand pocket was in JOHN MEAD I took possession of the cap and gloves at the Serjeant but not the halfpence the shot was then in the cap when I searched Fare I found a very small quantity of shot loose in his waistcoat pocket with the bowl of the tobacco pipe - I did not take them all out they are the same size as those found with the body I found no shot in the deceased s clothes - I did not search Cross-examined Q The shot was inside the cap A Yes when I saw it - I understood it was picked up and put in the cap here is all the shot I took from Fare he had more but it was a very small quantity Re-examined The shot was produced before the Jury that found on the ground and on the deceased were compared and they were the same shot No 4 JOHN CUFFLEY I keep the Serjeant On the morning of the alarm I went to Holt White s-lane and saw the body of the deceased I got there about a quarter to seven o clock Wheeler and several others were there I saw the cap the gloves some halfpence and some small shot laid by the side of it I do not think the face was downwards but it had been moved I put the gloves into the cap there is about three quarters of a pound of shot in the deceased s pocket now - the deceased had half a quarter of a pound of shot in his rough jacket pocket I think in turning the body over some might have fallen out Cross-examined Q It is a very common size shot Yes Upon comparing the shot produced some corresponded in size and the rest differed JOSEPH MATTHEWS I gave the deceased change shortly before he left the public-house that night and gave him 4d in halfpence that was the last time he paid me any thing - I cannot say whether it was all in halfpence Cross-examined Q Did you notice which pocket he put it into A No he put it into some of his pockets - he did not pull out his purse to put it in I do not think he put it into his trousers pocket JOHN MEAD I found eight halfpence and a penny-piece on Fare when I went to the spot where the murder was committed - in searching about I picked up a halfpenny - I saw no more the two had been found before as I was told - Watkins searched Johnson RICHARD WATKINS I found a shilling on Johnson that was all the money I found on him PETER ADDINGTON The deceased was a connexion of mine by marriage and lived at my house at Enfield from the 12th to the 19th of December and accompained me in my rounds to my customers - I drove a cart he had been out with me on the Wednesday on which he was murdered and on the Tuesday and Monday - on the Wednesday morning I lent him the bowl of a tobacco-pipe I should know it again looking at it this is it I had it about twelve months and used it to load a gun and lent it him for that purpose I can take on myself to swear this is the bowl I lent him - here is a little bit broken out of it - I passed the Holly-bush with him on Tuesday the day before the murder Cross-examined Q There are several bits broken out of it A No only in one place I only broke it in one place that is inside - I never knew any body else charge a gun with a bowl MR CLARKSON Q Is it a bowl with figures on it A Yes here is a greyhound on it and a leaf worked up the back - I never noticed more than one greyhound on i- I broke this piece out myself - I am quite sure it if the same bowl JURY Q Do you know if he had different size shots with him A I cannot tell MR BODKIN Q In what pocket did he keep his shot and the bowl A I believe in the inside jacket pocket THOMAS NEWMAN I am a labourer and live at Enfield On the day before the murder in the morning I was with Fareby the Holly-bush - Addington and the deceased went past in the cart Fare asked me if that was the man who had got all that money which they talked so much about I said I did not know no more than a child he said he wished he knew whether it was him or not for if he could light on him in the dark he would cut his wizen but he would have some of it Cross-examined Q I suppose you went and told the nearest constable you could find A No I told one Brown on the Thursday night nobody else was present it was about half-past nine o clock in the morning WILLIAM WALKER I keep the Rising Sun at Enfield about a quarter of a mile from Addington s - it leads on to the Chase side-road On the morning before I heard of the murder I saw Mr Danby at about half-past twelve o clock Wednesday morning - he came to my house I had given him change for a sovereign on the Tuesday night I gave him 20s he returned me one to pay for some gin and water - I gave it him all in shillings JURY to JOHN COOPER Q You say Fare fell towards the paling - was the deceased s face or back towards Fare A Fare had hold of the right-hand side of the deceased when he fell Q Was Johnson twisted about at all A A little he was on the left-hand side MR BODKIN Q After Fare left you on which side of the deceased did Johnson walk A On the right-hand side all the way I should think he had an opportunity of taking any thing from the deceased if so inclined - the struggling lasted about half a minute Fare had hold of him I did not see him meddle with his pockets MR CLARKSON Q On which side of the deceased was Fare A On the right-hand side he had an opportunity of robbing him if so disposed I could not see whether he had his hand in his pocket - he was on his right side all the time till he left he did not tell us he was going away he left without saying a word Q Was the road light A There is a hedge it is not so light as the Chase-side road JOHN CUFFLEY I was present when the deceased s clothes were examined there was some halfpence and a sixpence I believe found I had the key of the room all the time till the Inquest nobody could get at it RICHARD WATKINS I examined the deceased s clothes at the Inquest and found a sixpence and a foreign halfpenny in the inside jacket pocket - there was no other money on him at all MR ADDINGTON I lent him the bowl between nine and ten o clock on Wednesday morning he was shooting that day Prisoner s Defence written I most solemnly declare my innocence of the charge - I am accused of having in my possession a tobacco-pipe bowl some shot and 11s in silver the supposed property of the deceased Benjamin Couch Danby which has been attempted to be proved by circumstantial evidence only to have been the property of the deceased I submit to your Lordship and Gentlemen that there is no proof that the deceased was robbed by me nor indeed was he which I most solemnly declare I do trust that your Lordship and Gentlemen will not deem the possession of a tobacco-pipe bowl and which I had had upwards of one month previous to the day in which the unfortunate and dreadful business was committed and which I had used at least three weeks previous to the murder on which day I had been shooting birds on the Chase in company of Henry Keep Thomas Moles and George Hill all of whom would have proved they saw me with the tobacco-pipe bowl which I then used to charge the gun with powder with which I shot the birds - the gun had been lent me by a person named William Cufflin the shot found also upon me was part of what I had on that day and are No 4 shots - the above persons were present yesterday to prove these facts as my instruction to the Counsel would prove they all of them having been subpoenaed and were in attendance but in consequence of my acquittal of the murder they have thought themselves discharged from their subpoenas and never contemplated being called upon this day as evidence to prove that for which they were in attendance yesterday -

t18330103-9  Before Mr Justice James Parke 257 HENRY LARBY was indicted for feloniously assaulting William Anthony Roberts on the 11th of December putting him in fear and taking from his person and against his will 1 pocket-book value 6d 6 sovereigns 1 half-sovereign 28 shillings one 200l one 20l one 10l and one 5l Bank note and one 1l promissory note his property WILLIAM ANTHONY ROBERTS I am clerk to Mr Harridge solicitor of the Strand On the 10th of December at one o clock in the morning I took a cabriolet in Tottenham-court-road the prisoner was the driver - I drove it to various parts of London and returned to Tottenham-court-road at a quarter to four o clock I went into a public-house there I had nothing to drink there - I went to the King s Head and think the prisoner had something to drink there when I got to the public-house in Tottenham-court-road I paid the prisoner 4s and one of the traces being broken he demanded 6d more - I would not pay him and he gave me in charge of a Policeman I was taken to the station-house and on giving my address there the inspector set me at liberty - I passed up Tottenham-court-road and saw nothing of the prisoner till I crossed the New-road towards Camden-town I then met the prisoner without his cab - a person named Young was with him he said He was extremely sorry for taking me tothe station-house I took no notice and then he said as it was a cold morning would I object to give him some warm beer - I said Not the least and we went to the King s Head at the corner of Hampstead-road he had some beer there which I paid for and left the house - he followed me I went through several streets until I arrived at Carburton-street - he and Young followed me I went into the Lord Nelson in that street and ordered some breakfast as soon as the breakfast was brought the prisoner and Young both came into the room where I sat it was between seven and eight o clock in the morning nearly eight they stood by the fire-place talking I immediately left the room and walked out without taking my breakfast or paying for it - with the intention of leaving the house without their perceiving me when I got about three hundred yards from the house the prisoner ran after me and told me I had neglected to pay for my breakfast I returned and paid for it - I immediately left the house again and the prisoner came out and again began to apologise for having sent me to the station-house and requested me to have some spirits or something at his expense which I refused - he then wanted me to pay for some which I refused he immediately took hold of my coat with his back towards the house and tried to drag me towards the house but I resisted - I being stronger than himself he could not get me in and he turned with his face towards the door and tried to push me into the house but in that he failed I cannot swear whether it was accidental or not but he still had hold of my coat - his foot slipped and he fell down on his back and pulled me down on my knees my coat burst open and my pocketbook fell from the pocket and the gold and silver which I had in my pocket-book fell from it by the weight of it - the notes remained in another pocket of the book I snatched up my pocket-book and put it into my pocket - that was never in the possession of the prisoner the gold and silver fell on the pavement - the prisoner and Young immediately snatched it up there were six sovereigns one half-sovereign and 28s that was my own - there was 245l in notes in the pocket-book belonging to my employer I did not recover any of the money from the prisoner and Young - I am certain the prisoner took up some of the money I positively swear I saw him pick up two sovereigns and three shillings Young immediately ran away but the prisoner leaned against the right-hand post of the door - I went to him and asked him for the money he had picked up he refused to give it me saying he had picked none up - I suppose on account of his having wooden shoes on he was not able to run I called for a Policeman but none being near I crossed over to Mr Lamb gave him my pocket-book and immediately went to the station and got a Policeman at the time of the robbery the prisoner was not at all intoxicated nor was I - he was taken up about half-past ten o clock that morning I have not a doubt of his person - when I was at the King s Head St Giles I think I produced the pocket-book in his presence but the notes could not be seen I took my pocket-book out and paid for what I had there out of it - my pockets were in a dilapidated state it was about one o clock when I was at the King s Head he was not intoxicated at the time I was robbed Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q What are you A A clerk I have to say that in taking the prisoner into custody he was in such a state of intoxication we could not take him before the Magistrate at the usual hour and deferred it till the evening - I consider that he got intoxicated with my money I had been at a party in the King s-road Pimlico I went there about eight o clock and staid till about half-past ten - I played at cards and different diversions I had about two glasses of home-made wine there that was all - I went from there to my employer s in Edgware-road staid there about a quarter of an hour and went from there to Tottenham-court-road without stopping I live in York-place Kentish-town - I drove to different parts of London first to the King s Head St Giles the prisoner had a small glass of brandy there which I paid for I had nothing - I drove myself I got to the King s Head about a quarter past one o clock I went from there to the watering-house in the Old Bailey I had no business there it was merely in my way Q Where to A To no place in particular - I did not get out of the cab there the prisoner said it was cold and wished for something - he had a small glass of brandy there which I paid 4d for I then drove over Blackfriars-bridge and back over London-bridge down Fenchurch-street to the Old Bailey again I gave him a glass of brandy there - then drove through Covent-garden Drury-lane to Tottenham-court-road I went into the Red Lion there and gave him up the cab - it was about five o clock I called for some bread and cheese for supper and he came in and asked for 6d for the broken trace I did not pay for it - 4s was what he demanded for his fare Q When he was pulling you into the house in Carburton-street why not give an alarm A I did not consider his intention was to rob me I told him repeatedly to desist but he would not and then he tried to push me in - I did not call out because people were standing by and if I had chosen to use any means I could have done so without assistance there were one or two cab-men standing by the door when I called for the Policeman - my money was scattered about the street the persons about were a set of cab-men I saw nobody in the house but two women - if I had offered to detain the prisoner I considered I should not have got off so easy as there were a number of cab-men and such sort about I am not in the habit of associating with such fellows - I considered the 245l quite safe I have had treble that sum in my pocket - it was a silly foolish excursion I am not in the habit of doing so JAMES LAMB I am a grocer and live in Carburton-street On Tuesday morning the 10th of December I was at my door and observed the prosecutor pulled about by a set of cab-men and observed the prisoner lay hold of his coat and pull it open - his pocket-book fell out and the money fell out I saw the prisoner pick up some money but what it was I cannot say and I saw Young distinctly pick up money and put it in his pocket I beckoned to the prosecutor to come over - I certainly observed the prisoner pick up something I could not tell whether it was money or not - he picked up something twice off the ground I could not see what he did with it - I could distinctly see that it was money which Young picked up I beckoned to the prosecutor to come over to my door - he came into the shop he gave me his pocket-book to take care of - there was a 200l note in it and other notes Cross-examined Q You saw the prosecutor pulledabout by a set of cab-men A Yes I saw the prisoner pull him there is a cab-yard next to my house and the cabmen assemble at the house opposite Q Just tell me whether you saw the prosecutor pulled about by the cab-men and then the prisoner seized hold of him A Young who has escaped is a cab-man and they both pulled him about - the others were round him I cannot say whether they touched him - I did not go up to the prosecutor I was across the street - the prosecutor stood against the Lord Nelson public-house I did not leave my shop to give him in charge - I had nobody in it the prosecutor called for a Policeman for a quarter of an hour but there was none - the station is about a quarter of a mile from my house the prisoner had wooden shoes on - I saw him go away at last he walked away leisurely JURY Q Was the prosecutor intoxicated A No he appeared as if he had been out all night raking but not drunk he knew what he was about and delivered his money into my hands THOMAS SOPER I am a Policeman I apprehended the prisoner at twelve o clock on Tuesday the 11th of December at his lodging Ames-yard Charles-street Hampstead-road - he was drunk and asleep I told him I wanted him to go with me - he said I know all about it go on and I will follow you he then dozed off again -I told him the gentleman gave charge of him for robbing him he said It was a b-y good job to charge him with robbing him for he had got nothing I searched him and his lodging and found no money at all - the prosecutor was with me I saw him about nine o clock - he appeared as if he had been drinking but was not drunk then WILLIAM PEARCE I am a Policeman I was on duty in Tottenham-court-road on Thursday morning about five o clock - the prisoner gave the prosecutor in charge for not paying his fare Roberts at that time I could perceive had been drinking but knew perfectly what he was about - I could tell by his appearance that he had been out all night - he talked rational I afterwards saw the prisoner in company with another man - I overtook them in Tottenham-court-road it was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after Roberts was discharged I was with them in the Blue-posts public-house and drank a glass of rum with them - I heard the prisoner say Roberts had got plenty of money between 200l and 300l - that he saw two 10l notes in his front coat pocket and he put his hand to his breast Young and another person were standing behind him at the time - he knew that I was present he left the house with Young - they drove the cab away Cross-examined Q Were you on duty that night A Yes my beat is nearly half a mile from Carburton-street I had my uniform coat on - the prisoner paid for my rum I was sober - I was off duty then we are not forbid to go to public-houses when off duty - I did not know him before the prisoner said he had been paid 4s and demanded 6d more at the public-house but at the station-house he demanded 2s 6d - he demanded the 6d for his fare I heard nothing about the trace till afterwards - there ought to be a Policeman round Carburton-street but it takes the man there half an hour to go round his beat the station is three quarters of a mile from the Lord Nelson I think JURY Q Who was driving the cab A Nobody when I saw it they were in the public-house and the cab was at the door - the prosecutor walked from the station-house Prisoner s Defence The prosecutor went to several houses and was quite intoxicated he drank at every house as I did - he changed a sovereign at the Old Bailey to give the waterman something to drink he treated several people who stood round WILLIAM ANTHONY ROBERTS re-examined I had received the money from my master that night to apply to different purposes as he was going from town next day I changed a sovereign at the Old Bailey to pay for brandy GUILTY of stealing but not from the person Aged 26 Transported for Seven Years

t18340220-50  First London Jury before Mr Recorder 368 MICHAEL TIERNEY MATTHEW CREAMER PATRICK NOWLAND and GEORGE ADAMS were indicted for feloniously assaulting George Procter on the 12th of February at St Giles s Without Cripplegate with a felonious intent to rob him and his goods and monies from his person and against his will violently and feloniously to steal against the Statute &c Messrs BULLOCK and GURNEY conducted the Prosecution GEORGE PROCTER I am a tobacconist and live at No 101 Fleet-street - on the morning of Wednesday the 12th of February I was walking along Chiswell-street - I was proceeding from my brother s - on getting opposite Whitecross-street on the left hand side of the way - as near as I can recollect it was a quarter after one - I had left my brothers as the clock struck one - three of my brothers and a friend were with me - we were all walking singly - one of my brothers was not quite a yard in advance of me and my other two brothers and a friend eight or ten yards behind me - one of them was stopping to tie his garters or drawers which had come down - before I got opposite Whitecross-street I observed a man on the right hand side of the way standing apparently at the edge of the curb - I heard a voice in a sort of audible whisper say At the second and immediately the man darted across the road in the direction that I was standing - supposing that he was going to push against me I merely put my elbows up - but he struck me on the breast kicked me on the shin and threw me on my back in an instant - when I arose there were two strangepersons there as well as one of my brothers who had come up - while I was on the ground I heard a whistle - I observed nothing when I heard the voice except the one man - as soon as I arose I got on my feet and went on in the direction I was going following my brother who was in advance crying Watch and Police and the police were on the spot instantly - the whistle brought part of the same party down from the end of Whitecross-street - I should say there were seven or eight of them came on the whistle being given - I got out of the way as quick as possible and was not engaged in the affray with the watchman - I lost no property - my two brothers were knocked down Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You have stated all you heard - A Yes after the words At the second the man knocked me down and then there was a whistle and several persons assembled from the upper end of Whitecross-street - I believe nobody was in the street except the five composing our party and the party who assaulted us - only one man assaulted me - I called Watch and Police - that brought watchmen and policemen round me - I do not think the noise I made caused persons to assemble about me - I will not swear it did or did not call some casual spectators - I am sure I was knocked down - no attempt was made at my pockets nor any words used that I heard indicating an intention to rob me - I had spent the evening at my brother s in Bishopsgate-street - it is a tobacconist s the same trade as myself - six brothers and one stranger formed the party - I went there about nine o clock and stayed till past one - I had supped certainly and drank - Mr Hodge was the other person - I supped at eleven o clock after the shop was closed which was at eleven o clock - it struck one o clock as we left - I had taken a glass of gin and water - I think I had half a glass afterwards - I had a glass of porter at supper - I will swear I had not two glasses of gin and water after supper - the second glass was not filled I had a glass or glass and half or two glasses of porter at supper - I cannot tell - I had no other liquor - I went out of the crowd as soon as I got on my legs and saw nothing more till the prisoners were in custody - being perfectly sober I was competent to recognise persons - I saw nothing of the prisoners till they were in the custody of the watchmen that was not more than seven minutes I should think after the row in the street - two of us had been walking together but we were going one and one when this took place but previously we had been walking two and three on the pavement of the street we had left two persons could not conveniently walk together - we had left go in this narrow street and had not rejoined - the street it happened in was wide enough for two to walk together - we might have got fifty yards up the street - I cannot say - we were quite as quiet as I am at the present moment and as little disposed for larking as you are now - it is my habit to be out as late as that and sometimes later very seldom till three or four but I am so occasionally - this has been my habit for twenty-five years - my shop is open at six o clock half the year and seven o clock the other half but it is not closed until ten o clock at night HENRY HODGE On the 12th of February I was with Mr Procter in Chiswell-street about one o clock or a quarter after I was walking eight or ten yards behind Mr George Procter - a man passed me and touched him by the elbows then ran across the road and cried out Now for it to-night and immediately afterwards two men ran across from Whitecross-street and a man in a short jacket struck Mr Procter and he fell who I believe from his height and being captured immediately afterwards to be Matthew Tierney he struck Mr Procter eight or ten more men came up I do not know their faces and some women and a general affray took place a quarrel ensued and the police and constables got much injured they wished to rescue the prisoner nobody in particular quarrelled but they struck Mr Procter and we called the police who came we wished to capture the two men who first crossed the road one of whom to the best of my belief was Matthew Tierney I do not know the other JOHN HARDING I am a watchman of Cripplegate Without - on the morning of the 12th of February I heard a cry of Police and Watch - I immediately went towards the place to the end of Chiswell-street and towards the corner of Beech-street Mr Procter gave charge of the prisoner Tierney - I immediately took him by the collar - he said I have done nothing Mr Procter said You have knocked me down once and my brother has been knocked down twice by the same party and no doubt with intent to rob me - I immediately took the prisoner along a little further ten or twenty yards - I turned round and saw the other three coming up- they said Where are you going to take the prisoner - I said he was given in charge and I was going to take him to the watch-house - Adams said You b- if you do not let him go I will knock your brains out - I went a few steps further and took my truncheon out and said You had better keep off or it will be the worse for you - he said Where are you going to take him I said To the watch-house - he again replied I will knock your brains out you b- you shall not take him any further - he seized hold of my truncheon - a policeman came up G 93 and I took Tierney along till I was interrupted by the other three prisoners - I delivered him to the policeman G 93 - Adams then caught hold of my staff and dragged me across the street he got me down by a hard tustle took my staff out of my hand and laid it across my head and broke my head in two places and then said I think I have done the b- s business for him - another of them not taken said George you have not half done his business give it to me - he took it and he hit me across the ribs five or six times and jumped upon me Creamer is the man who jumped upon me - a little after nine o clock that same night I had seen Adams Creamer and Nowland just at the end of Chiswell-street crossing just at the end of my beat between Whitecross-street and Chiswell-street - here is the handkerchief I had round my neck it is bloody - I had given no offence to them Cross-examined Q Have you preferred an indictment against them for assaulting you A Yes for assaulting me in the execution of my duty in this very transaction RICHARD POULTON policeman On the morning of the 12th of February I was on duty - I was not present when the transaction took place I came up about five minutes after as I suppose - I heard a rattle spring and went up and found Tierney in custody - I saw Adams runaway - I saw a gentleman there but I cannot swear it was the prosecutor - I saw an attempt to rescue Tierney and heard a gentleman say Secure that man in the flannel jacket for he is the man who attempted to rob me - that was Creamer - he said in Creamer s presence that he had attempted to rob him and I took Creamer into custody - I saw Tierney there Cross-examined Q Is the gentleman here who said the man in the flannel jacket attempted to rob him A I cannot say the gentleman did not tell me so but I heard that said in the crowd - I do not know who said so I only heard a voice say so I had not an opportunity of calling for the person who made that charge - nobody came to the watch-house and charged him with attempting to rob him in my presence because we were ordered out - I have since seen a person who charged Creamer with attempting to rob him his name is Procter - I do not know his Christian name - I was not in the watch-house when the charge was taken - I have not brought the charge book Q Did any man give Creamer in charge to you at the watch-house or elsewhere for attempting to rob him A No I heard the voice when I went up - I did not call for the person who owned the voice - I cannot name anybody who gave Creamer in charge for attempting to rob him - I am not a witness on the common assault bill - I do not know at whose instance this prosecution is instituted - a gentleman named Procter is the prosecutor MR PHILLIPS to GEORGE PROCTER Q Pray is this prosecution undertaken at your expense A No the City prosecute - I am the prosecutor but I suppose it is not at my expense - if it is at my expense I shall have no objection to pay it - I hope it is not - I gave the three men in custody when I got to the watch-house - Creamer was one of them - I did not say he had attempted to rob me - I went into the grand jury-room twice and was sworn twice - the other indictment is not at my expense COURT Q Did you hear anybody speak of a person in a flannel jacket A No I was not the person who used that expression - I gave Tierney Nowland and Creamer into custody as being on the spot when I got on my legs but I do not swear positively to their knocking me down THOMAS COLYER I was on duty in Whitecross-street on the 12th of February about half-past one o clock in the morning - I was standing at the corner by the Cat public-house at the corner of Whitecross-street and I saw the prisoners at the bar and several other men and five women come along Chiswell-street - they passed a few yards up Upper Whitecross-street - I saw a man who crossed from Lower Whitecross-street - it was not either of the prisoners - he said George and Mike it is all right - two men crossed over and the man who called out to George and Mike It is all right - Adams crossed over with Tierney - Adams said to the man who called out Which is he but previous to that the man who first called out to Adams said The gentleman gave me a smack on the mouth - that was previous to the man s calling out George and Mike it is all right - but observing me at the Cat he said Here is a gentleman has given me a smack on the mouth - that was said on observing me - and on Adams and Tierney crossing over Adams said Which is he - the man pointed to a gentleman and said That is him - there were two or three gentlemen together and at that momemt Adams struck one of the gentlemen Mr Richard Procter who fell - I rose him up and put on his hat - after so doing I turned my head and saw the man who first called out to George and Mike standing in a fighting attitude to another gentleman - I cannot say which gentleman it was of the three - I had not the opportunity of seeing whether either of them had struck Adams or any of the party it was so quick - I then had a scuffle with that man and attempted to take him - and after having the scuffle I fell on the ground - I rose up and heard a cry of Police - and by that time the three gentlemen who were at the corner of Whitecross-street had got to the corner of Beech-lane which is twenty or thirty yards -

somebody spoke to me - I turned round my head and received a blow in the eye - I turned round directly to give him a good chastisement for what he had done but was surrounded immediately by a gang - Steel came up the instant I laid hold of Keith and struck me while others behind me got me down on my back and got beating me - I cannot swear the female prisoner was one of the party but she came up in Crispin-street and began to mob me and said Keith was not the man - I first saw her to be certain of her a quarter of a mile off - I kept hold of Keith while on the ground till I was so beat I lost all recollection - I called the police - while I was on the ground I felt their hands down at my fob and they forced three buttons off my trousers and my braces were undone -

I had not struck Keith - I seized hold of him - I was surrounded by them in all quarters the moment I laid hold of Keith - I had an umbrella with me - I did not lose it - I kept hold of it - I became insensible when on the ground - my umbrella was lying by my side when I came to myself - I might have used the umbrella in the irritation - I swear I did not strike Steel with it - if I struck any body it was Keith - I certainly struck him with it - I cannot swear whether I struck him once or twice Q Are you sure when you imagined you struck at Keith you might not have struck at Steel A I am because the others were behind me and I could not strike them - when Keith struck me I collared him immediately - whether the others came to his rescue or not I cannot tell - when I was down I felt my breeches tugged at - I had hold of Keith with one hand - there was a great scuffle - I felt their hands right inside my clothes - I swear I distinctly felt their hands at my fob and right hand pocket Q Did you never say to Duff s father that at the trial if he would give you 10s you would endeavour to get her off A Never they have offered it to me and a friend of Steel s has offered me a sovereign while I have been here this morning -

t18361212-245  245 JOHN DAVIS was indicted for a robbery on William Munnings Thomas on the 5th of December putting him in fear and taking from his person and against his will 1 cloak value 15s and 1 shilling his goods and monies WILLIAM MUNNINGS THOMAS I am a clerk in the Coast Guard Office in the Custom House and live in Warwick-square On Monday the 5th of this month I went to Drury-lane theatre at half-price—I waisted there for half-price to commence—there were a number of people waiting as well as me—I had a silk handkerchief on my neck which I took off—I dropped it with my gloves—the prisoner picked them up and offered them back to me—he made a half bow and said Shall I hold them for you while I was tying my neckcloth and putting my collar to rights—I do not know that I answered him but I made a kind of bow of assent and went on adjusting my black handkerchief and collar—I then turned round to receive my handkerchief and gloves but the prisoner was gone—I went after him and found him in about half an hour under the piazza of Covent-garden—he said he had been looking for me and he said You will think it odd or think me odd but I caught a glimpse of a friend and at the impulse of the moment I rushed after him quite forgetting that I had your things but could not find him —I said I was very glad we had met and asked him for my handkerchief—he looked at himself and said I have just been to change my coat and having given up the idea of seeing you again this evening I have left the gloves and handkerchief in the coat but he said if I was walking his way we would go and fetch them—he then took hold of my arm and asked me to go into a public-house opposite first to see if his friend was there—we went in but there was no one there that looked likely to be his friend—I observed to him that there seemed to be nobody there who knew him and was proposing to go—he then asked me whether I would not have any thing to drink—I said I really did not want anything—I appeared rather vexed and proposed going—when we got out of the house he said I might any morning find him at a large shop in St Paul s churchyard—he again took hold of my arm and said we would go to his rooms—we walked up to a house in Brownlow-street and when we came to a kind of public entrance to several rooms the door was open—he stopped me and said I will run up and fetch your handkerchief and gloves I won t trouble you to come up —this staircase seemed to have a thoroughfare at the foot of it out behind into a yard or some other street—I fancied he wanted to escape with my property and I told him it would not be the least trouble and I had rather accompany him up and fetch them—there was a woman on the staircase with a light which she gave to the prisoner—he went up to his room opened the door and walked in I following him—the room struck me as rather an odd one not at all according with the person s appearance it was very shabby—and on my turning round the prisoner had slipped back and shut the door and was taking the key out of the lock and putting it into his pocket—I was very much alarmed and thought I had fallen into a snare of some kind but I tried to look as calm and collected as possible and I civilly asked him for my handkerchief—he said Ah we will talk of that presently let us have something to drink at the same time holding out his hand to me to supply it and I wishing to keep on terms with him and being in fear gave him a shilling when be immediately said Come I know you have a sovereign about you —I assured him I had not one—he again said he was quite sure I had it was all nonsense and on my saying I really had not any thing more about me he stepped forward or rather rushed forward and seized my cloak from off the chair which was standing by me—it was half on the chair—I had it on my arm when I came in—he said I must keep this till you bring me one —it was lying on the front of the chair—whether part of it was on my arm or sleeve or not I cannot say—it had slipped off and I think the sleeve might be on my arm—I had never thrown it from me but in feeling for the shilling it had slipped off—I was touching it—my knee was against it—I then remonstrated with him and he retorted I did not ask you to come up —I said it might have been as well if we had brought a third person—he asked what I meant—I muttered something about the police when he said Ah a pretty figure you would appear in the papers before all your friends as a d - - d s—d —I did not reply to that and he said throwing the cloak on the bed Well we will say nothing more of that if you will bring me the sovereign you shall have the cloak but you must let me have something more to keep till you bring me the sovereign and upon my again assuring him that I really had nothing more about me and in feeling my waistcoat-pockets at the same time my under-coat flew open or I opened it myself and he spied two shirt-studs which I had and also a ring which I had on my finger—he immediately demanded them—but I stood out for those and said Nothing shall induce me to part with these —he said Well well I do not wish to be hard upon you you will bring me the sovereign I am sure won t you —I said I will but I am sure I will not bring it to this place —he then asked me whether I would bring it to the Piazza where we had met in the evening—I said I would—he asked me whether I would come on Thursday and I thinking it was then Tuesday evening instead of Monday and wishing to gain time if I took any advice said I should be out on Thursday but would come on Friday—he then came round in a more familiar manner he had been walking about —he stirred the fire and patted or touched me on the shoulder saying I am sure I can depend on your coming my good fellow —he then said we would go and get something to drink and he unlocked the door but did not put on his hat—he accompanied me down stairs and again reminded me of the appointment on Friday evening and we parted—next morning I went to a friend who was an attorney on my way to the Custom House but he had not come to his office—I went to the Custom House and got away a little earlier than usual and went to a friend a barrister in Gray s Inn for advice and I went immediately to Marlborough-street police-office—the Magistrates had separated and I went to the house of the senior Magistrate Mr Dyer who told me to come to the office next morning and he there granted me a warrant against the prisoner and introduced me to Schofield the officer who went with me down to the neighbourhood of the theatres—Schofield directed me to walk before him—after walking some time I fancied I saw the prisoner at some distance before me in a M Intosh cloak—Schofield gave me directions how to act and in another street close by there I purposely brushed up against him and came in contact with him—on our recognising each other he said Yes here I am and in your cloak too —I made signs to Schofield and he came up and took the prisoner—he then denied ever having seen me before and said the cloak was his own—I can positively swear to the cloak he had on being mine Prisoner Q Did you tell the Magistrate I seized the cloak which you threw across the chair A I told him you snatched the cloak off the chair—I had brought it from the theatre with me on my back—I had it on when we went to the public-house BENJAMIN SCHOFIELD I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street office The prosecutor came to me on Wednesday last about three or four o clock in the afternoon—I went with him about eight o clock towards Drury-lane theatre and just at the end of Marquis-court Drury-lane he pointed out the prisoner to me in company with three others—I walked up to them where they were all stopping in Vinegar-yard—the prisoner on the prosecutor coming up to him walked off at a very quick rate—he went through Cross-court Russell-court into Drury-lane turning round the corner of White Hart-street where I passed the prosecutor and the prisoner in conversation together—I heard them speaking together—I immediately turned round after passing them took hold of the prisoner and said he was say prisoner as I had a warrant against him for felony—I asked him if he knew the gentleman he was talking to pointing to the prosecutor—he said No I never saw him before in my life —I asked him if he recollected taking a pocket-handkerchief and a pair of gloves at the theatre on Monday night last from a gentleman—he said No nothing of the kind —I asked if he recollected going to his lodging on Monday night with a gentleman—he said no he did not recollect any one at all—I asked him if he recollected any thing about a cloak that he had had of a gentleman—he answered no he had not—I then took him into the Marlborough Head public-house Marlborough-street opposite the office—I called the prosecutor in who immediately identified this cloak which was on the prisoner—the prisoner most positively denied it being his and said it was his own—he likewise said to the prosecutor You never saw me with your eyes before in your life and I never saw you —I repeatedly asked the prisoner for his name and address which he refused to give me—on the following day he gave the name of John Davis before the Magistrate and requested me to go to his uncle to make inquiry about him—his examination was not taken down in writing at that time—it was merely an investigation taking place—it was on Thursday—his examination was not taken till Saturday—he wrote his uncle s address on the back of the warrant Mr Price edge-tool maker Curtain-road Shoreditch —I went there and saw Mr Price and found they were not related—this is the cloak I took off the prisoner and here is a pair of gloves which were in the pocket WILLIAM MUNNINGS re-examined I can swear to this cloak from one or two marks—I mentioned before I saw it that there was a little burant hole in the cuff and I pulled the cuff down and found it there—the buttons are the same and there is a shooting flap which I know it by—I can swear to the cloak most positively—it is the same I have spoken of Prisoner Q Did you not meet me on Monday week in Wych-street about eight o clock near Madame Vestris Theatre as I was looking into as print-shop A No—I did not ask you if you had read Fanny Hill —I did not ask you where you were going and you did not say you were going into the Strand—I did not ask you to have any thing to drink—I came through Wych-street if that is street Madame Vestris theatre is in on my way to Drury-lane—I cannot say at what time but when I got to the theatre half-price had not commenced—I will swear I did not stop to look into a print-shop—I might turn my head it there was a shop with a light in it but I did not stop at any shop not for one moment—I walked on the same side as the print-shop I think—I crossed over to go to the theatre—I know there is a print-shop there—I do not know Dugdale s shop—I never heard that name before—I did not walk with you from that shop to the end of Drury-lane—I did not ask you where you lived Prisoner s Defence After we passed the side of Drury-lane theatre which leads to Lincoln s-Inn-fields he asked me where I lived—I told him with Mr and Mrs Nelson—he said Suppose I go with you to your lodging we will have something to drink there —I said I had no objection very likely Mrs Nelson would be there and we could have a comfortable glass together—we then walked on till we came to Brownlow-street—I went up stairs and when he came up I asked him to sit down and told him Mrs Nelson was out and would not be long before she was in—I stirred up the fire—he sat down took off his M Intosh cloak and threw it on chair—he then said What shall we have to drink —I said A little gin if you like and he gave me a shilling out of his waistcoat pocket to fetch the gin—I fetched sixpennyworth and gave him 6d change—he waited in the room while I went for it—we were talking about one thing or another—I told him I had to go out a great deal in the wet—he said he should be very happy to see me and my landlady and so on and he promised me the cloak which was then on the chair till Friday night—this was on the Monday night and I was to meet him under the piazza of Covent-garden—he asked me if I was fond of reading—I told him I was—he said he would bring me two or three books and he hoped he should be better acquainted with me and he should like to see my landlady—after he had sat about an hour he said Well you will see me down stairs —I took the light and said You know the direction No 18 Brownlow-street —he said Yes I do and I bid him good night at the bottom of the stairs—I did not expect to be tried so soon or I could have had friends here GUILTY of

down several times—I was then very near a hundred yards from the Marsh-gate—the Marsh-gate is nearly two hundred yards from the public-house and I was about half-way from each—they wanted to drag me down a dark lane there—they said Bring the b - - down here and murder the b - - down the lane —they said that once I had them in my power but I could not help myself— I once belonged to the police —with that somebody came up behind me and struck me with his fist or something else and fractured my jaw with the blow—I could not see what the blow was inflicted with—as soon as I could recover

known the prisoner a long while while I was in the police—he never interfered with me and I never had a word with him—I have since ascertained he was in liquor or else I do not think he would have

never seen her in my life to my knowledge before—I said it was a very hard case I should be given in charge and I would not be locked up that night but would come in the morning if I was to be given in charge—I told the Magistrate I was very tipsy and had a row with the man but the wife I never saw before —if I had not been tipsy I should not have insulted him or any body MARY ANN GOOSE

t18371023-2378  2378 THOMAS DONAHOO SAMUEL KELLETT and CATHERINE PICTON were indicted for robbing David Duffin on the 13th of October at St Mary Matfelon alias White chapel putting him in fear and taking from his person and against his will 1 watch value 2l 1 snuff box value 6d and 52 sovereigns his goods and monies and that the said Thomas Donahoo immediately before and at the time of such robbery and the said Samuel Kellett and Catherine Picton being then and there feloniously present aiding and assisting feloniously did use personal violence to the said David Duffin by forcing him against a certain wall and down to the ground and placing his knee on his chest and pressing and squeezing his neck and throat MR JONES conducted the Prosecution DAVID DUFFIN I belong to the North of Ireland but have been latterly in America in the cloth business I arrived in this country on the 6th of October—I was living at No 20 King-street Tower-hill—on the evening of the 12th I was standing at St Katharine s Docks for nearly two hours—I had been drinking at three public-houses—I believe I met with the prisoners about eight o clock that night—I saw Donahoo first opposite St Katharine Dock gate—I knew nothing of him before—he said he was a sailor formerly and was one at that time but had been out of employment—he spoke to me first—he said he was in need on some trifling assistance and said Will you be so kind as to treat me —I said Yes I never saw a sailor who I was not willing to treat or assist —the prisoner Kellett was quite handy while I was talking to him and he came forwards—I cannot say whether I spoke to him first or he to me but he was on my right band and I said there was no sailor or soldier who I would not willingly treat— he is a soldier —they walked with me into a public-house opposite the Dock gate but before that the female prisoner came up and Donahoo introduced her as his wife and said would I be willing to treat his wife —I said Yes I will s—we all went into a public-house opposite and had something to drink which I paid for—we staid there two hours to the best of my knowledge and then went to another public-house in the same street—we all went in and had something to drink which I paid for and remained there nearly two hours to the best of my knowledge—we then went to a third public-house not far off—all the prisoners were in company with me—I treated them again there and remained there I dare say nearly two hours—after that we came out and I proposed to go to my residence—Donahoo said as I was so kind to them he wished me to go and take a cup of tea with him and his wife and invited the soldier also—I begged to be excused saying I had a coffee-house where I boarded but he insisted that I should follow and with great reluctance I consented and we all four walked away together—it was then about half-past four o clock in the morning—when I first met the prisoners I was neither drunk nor sober—I had taken some ale and porter—I was capable of understanding what I was about—I consider I was more sober at half-past four o clock when I agreed to go home to tea with them than I was before—as capable of knowing myself as when I met with them—I did not drink much at the three public-houses—Donahoo did not say where he lived—he said it was convenient—I went with them into Angel-alley Whitechapel—it is a lonely place—there was a wall on the left side—when I got within three feet of the further end of the alley Donahoo took hold of me by the collar with both hands and put me down on my back by the collar against the wall of the alley—he put me completely down on the flags with my hat right up against the wall—he did not say any thing at that time—the prisoner Kellett was standing within two paces of us and the woman within three paces—neither of them said a word—Donahoo put both his knees on my chest put his fingers or thumb on each side of my neck and squeezed my throat so that I could not speak—he took one of his hands away and then I had liberty to speak and said Gentlemen for God s sake save my life and take all I have —Donahoo said nothing to that but held me by the neck with one hand and put his other to my fob—I caught hold of my seal and held it fast and he tore the fob away and took my watch—here is the tear it made—the fob was torn out—the ribbon broke I held the seal and ring and he got the watch—he then put his hand to my vest—I cannot say whether it was the right or left hand—I cannot say whether it was the same hand as he took the watch with—his hand did not depart from it throat till the watch was taken from my pocket and the money from it vest—I am positive of that—he took a snuff-box from my vest which had fifty-two sovereigns in it—I had also two sovereigns in a purse besides at the time I first met them—I changed one sovereign at the first public house as my silver was expended—when I was in the first public-house I took my box out took the lid off and closed it again and pot it into my pocket but took no money out of it—I turned my back to ray company at the bar as I did not wish them to know what I had in it—I know it had spent none of that money—I cannot say whether the prisoners saw the box at that time—I only looked at it shut it and put it into my pocket again—I had my back to them therefore I thought they did not see it—I did not take the box out after that at all—after Donahoo took the box out of my pocket he liberated me—he got off me and as soon as I got on my feet I got away as quick as I could leaving them all three together behind me—I cannot say how long exactly T was in the alley—the other prisoners did not say or do any thing to me while Donahoo was taking the money—when he first seized hold of me the other two were standing close by and I saw them within a few inches of the same ground when I went away—as soon as I got into the street I saw three or four men and went right forward among them and told them I had been robbed—one of them called a policeman who came and I told him what had happened—about two or three hours after I went to the station-house and saw the three prisoners there in custody and identified them as the persons who had been with me—I saw my watch at the office the same morning but I have serer found my sovereigns Donahoo Q Who was in our company when we first met A I can only speak to you and your wife—I saw several other persons but cannot tell who they were—any you introduced to me as friends I treated—I treated all the concern—I did not swear at the office that I met the soldier first—I said I met the sailor and the soldier about the same time—I cannot say which I spoke to first but I believe it was the sailor—I do not recollect meeting three dragoons after coming out of the first public-house—I have no doubt I treated a waterman—I recollect three policemen being in the same public-house with us—I have no doubt of that and one of them called me aside and gave me a warning not to be in your company any longer—I do not recollect the policemen going with us to endeavour to get us admittance into any public-houses that were shut—I recollect treating the policemen—I ordered a treat to them and paid for them but I cannot say what they had—I may have treated three girls with three glasses of ale in the same house—any you introduced to me I said I would treat but I do not recollect treating the three girls—it may have been so—the female prisoner was in our company from the first starting to the last that I am positive of Donahoo Your Lordship will find in his deposition before the Magistrate that he said this woman did not meet us till four o clock in the morning —I wish his deposition read Witness looking at his deposition This is my signature— read — David Duffin on oath says I have been a carder and live at present at No 20 King-street Tower-hill Last Friday week I landed at the St Katharine s Docks from America—I met the prisoner Kellett the soldier Bear the gate of St Katharine s Docks yesterday morning about half past four o clock—I treated him at three different public-houses—the sailor prisoner I saw about twenty minutes after I saw the soldier—the tailor represented the woman prisoner as his wife—I treated them then—then walked in company with them some distance—they brought me into an alley or lane—the sailor put me up against the wall in this alley and then he put me down and put his knee on my chest—he put hit thumbs or his fingers under my chin to choke me—I had a watch in my pocket at the same time and he put his hand in and tore my fob out the best part of it and took the watch out of it—then he put his hand into my waistcoat pocket and took out a snuff-box containing fifty-two sovereigns in gold—I said Gentlemen save my life and take all I have —the soldier was within two paces of the sailor and the woman about three standing by at the same time—the soldier did not put hands to me in no way—I then ran out of the alley as quick as I could—I do not know where the sailor and the other went to—I saw the constable now present Richard Thompson soon after I got out of the alley—I know I had my money safe not twenty minutes before 1 was robbed—my waistcoat pocket was torn as well as my fob—that was done by the sailor in taking my snuff box Signed DAVID DUFFIN COURT Q You see according to this statement you said you saw the soldier twenty minutes before you saw the sailor A They were in company together when I saw them—half-past four o clock was the time they were taken—I saw them at eight o clock previous to that time—there is a mistake in the paper Donahoo Q Do you recollect at the top of Whitechapel having a bason of coffee a-piece six of us in company at an old woman a stand near Aldgate pump A I remember that there was a cup of coffee paid for but who paid for it I cannot tell—I did not—I certainly do remember a cup of coffee being got in the street but there was not six had only one in my presence—that was nearly opposite St Katharine s Dock gate—all the three prisoners were present at that time Kellett Q Was not I in the public-house opposite St Katharine s Docks when you came in A No—I first saw you in the street—you went into the public-house with me—I cannot say how many there were in company with you—there were several in the street when I first saw you—I cannot tell whether they were in your company or not—I do not believe I went into any public-house in King-street MR JONES Q About what time were you robbed A Between four and five o clock—although there were other persons in the public-house I was not in company with any but these three JOHN NOAKES I am the proprietor of a cab and drive it also On the morning of the 13th of October I was standing close against the rack in Whitechapel about five o clock or rather after—I was about twenty yards from Angel-alley and heard a bit of a scuffle and some man sung out For God s sake spare my life and in about two minutes or hardly that the prosecutor ran across the road to me from Angel-alley and said he had been robbed of fifty-two sovereigns and a watch—he had the seal and ring in his hand at the time—he said he was robbed by a soldier a sailor and a woman—he said so immediately on his coming up—he seemed very such agitated and his back was all over dust as if he had been down on it—I saw the prisoner Donahoo about ten minutes after in custody of the police man near Angel-alley—I saw Kellett come out of the alley first—that was not above five or six minutes after the prosecutor came to me—I did not speak to Kellett but several cabmen did and continued to talk to him all a policeman came up and took him into custody—a person there said That is the soldier who was along with him —Kellett heard it and said You may do as you like with me I don t care what you do with me I don t know what you are talking about —I had seen the prosecutor with two men one apparently dressed as a sailor and the other as a soldier at the corner of Goulston-street about an hour before—there was a woman with them but I did not see the faces of any of them then except the prosecutor—I saw the landlord of a public-house shove them out of the door and I saw the prosecutor s face but not the faces of the others—it was not day light—I did not see the sailor in the alley—the party standing round Kellett pointed him out in the street—I did not see the woman come out of the alley Donahoo Q Did the prosecutor come out of the alley first or Kellett A The prosecutor was the first that came across the road from the alley before Kellett came out MICHAEL SOUTHBY SHAW I assist my brother who keeps the White Hart public-house Whitechapel I opened the house about a quarter past four o clock on the morning of the 13th—the prosecutor came in in company with four persons the three prisoners and a women who was discharged at Lambeth-street—the prosecutor called for glasses of ale and three glasses of rum and after that had three pipes of tobacco—while he was going to light his pipe Kellett was standing at the corner of the counter and beckoned the sailor to come to him which he did—they whispered together and the prosecutor asked the sailor whether they were offended and asked the company the same—some of them said No they then went out—while they were going out the woman called for two pipes of tobacco and said that Duffin would pay for them—they all went out together stood at the door and talked together and I went round and asked Duffin to pay for the two pipes of tobacco—they all came in again—he paid me and they all went away—I believe this was about half an hour after they came about five o clock—my house is eight or ten doors from Angel-alley—the prosecutor seemed to be rather fresh when he left my house—I cannot say whether he was sufficiently collected to know what he was doing—I do not think he did have the presence of mind to know what he was about—the sailor took hold of his arm I believe and pulled him towards the door—I did not see him stagger RICHARD THOMPSON I am a policeman On the morning of the 13th of October about twenty minutes or half-past five o clock I received information that there had been a robbery—I was in Red Lion-street Whitechapel at the time—I went to the other side of High-street Whitechapel and there met Kellett—I told him I wanted him for robbing a man of his watch and money—he said he knew nothing about the man or money or watch either—I took him into custody—the prosecutor saw him at the station-house and said in his presence that he was the man who had robbed him—the sailor was apprehended in about ten minutes after about half-past five o clock or twenty minutes to six and very shortly after the prosecutor saw them both Picton Q Was I in custody at that time A I did not apprehend her at all—I first saw her in custody at Lambeth-street GIBBS LEEDS I am a policeman I was on duty in Whitechapel on the morning of the 13th—about twenty minutes before six o clock I was informed of the robbery and went into Essex-street—I met Donahoo coining out of a court in Essex-street four or five hundred yards from Angel-alley seven or eight minutes after I heard of the robbery—I asked him if he had been drinking with a soldier and sailor—he said Yes and I took him into custody—he said he knew nothing of the man at all—I found nothing on him relating to the robbery WILLIAM BULL I am a policeman About nine o clock on the morning of the 13th I met the prisoner Picton in Cable-street—I followed her to Mr Ramsden s the pawnbroker s and asked her if she had pawned her husband s watch—she said Yes —I said Where —she said In Ratcliffe-highway —I asked her for the duplicate—she said Why to tell you the truth I have not pawned it at all I have sold it right out for 15s —she took me to Findley s shop in Ratcliffe-highway and said Come with me I will show you I don t we it is my husband s watch —I asked her where her husband was—she said he was drinking at a house in East Smithfield—I did not ask his name—she took me to Findley s and I saw the watch there—she saw it and said There is the watch —I took her to the station-house—she gave up 12s 6d and said she had lent 2s 6d to another woman who was at the station-house aid that woman gave up 2s 6d GEORGE FINDLEY I am a watch-maker in Ratcliffe-highway On to 13th of October about nine o clock the female prisoner came to me and said she had a watch to sell—I asked her if it was her own—she said Yes her husband had sent her with it that he was a man of very bad character and had been out drinking with girls all night and they had sent him home without his jacket and she wanted the money to redeem his jacket—I asked where she lived—she said In Pell-street which is about four doors from my house and her husband was a sailor on board of a man-of-war—I bought the watch of her for 15s —this is it—it is in the same state as when I bought it—there was no ribbon to it when she brought it to me—it is what is called a duffer watch made by the Jews to deceive people DAVID DUFFIN re-examined I believe this to be the watch the prisoner took from me—the No is 18 153 and the maker s name is Ballingforde—I have had it about three weeks or not so long—the snuff-box was taken away with the money Picton Q Did you not give me the watch at seven o clock at night A No—I swear that—I did not go with you to a convenient place in Montague-street—it is false Q Did not I know you three years ago did we not go to Leeds is Yorkshire together A I have not been in Yorkshire since 1808 Picton When he gave me the watch after coming down from the place he said Come with me and I will get some money —I went with bin to a public-house and had a glass of rum and a pipe of tobacco and I changed half a crown to treat him as he had no money—he stopped there about an hour then came out and went from that public-house to another and he was so intoxicated he fell down on the ground—I went to help him up and I fell down too and where I lost him I cannot tell for I was intoxicated—I have known him three years previous Witness She did not pay for any liquor I had nor any of them—I had never seen her any where before Donahoo s Defence The night when we were together we met three of the 3rd Dragoon Guards who joined us and three policemen went in—we stopped at the public-house paid for rum and wine came out to Ald-gate and had six basins of coffee together—we went to the public-house and as soon as we got in at the door the landlord shoved him out as the cabman says seeing we were all drunk—we went from there to another public-house and had something to drink—the prosecutor says we all went out together but we did not go further than the door with him—there were four soldiers then and a sailor besides me a waterman who had been with us all night and a woman in a black gown—it must be a droll kind of a box to hold fifty-two sovereigns and not only so but when he was brought into the police-office that morning he had a sovereign half a crown and 1s 1 1/2d —I was not drunk at the time and knew what I was doing—the waterman and this woman we met in Whitechapel and she and the other woman were going to fight in the public-house—the three dragoons were with us from half-past eleven o clock that night—the prosecutor met us at half-past ten o clock and now he says it was twenty minutes before six o clock—we were brought to the police-office one says four o clock another says eight o clock—I deny the charge—neither the soldier nor me did any robbery to him—the women went over with another woman to drink gin and there were three women in company—the policeman asked me if I had been drinking with a soldier—I said no I had not Kellett s Defence 1 know nothing of the robbery—I left the white Hart a little before four o clock and saw no more of him till I was take by the policeman Picton s Defence He gave me the watch and denied having any money—I knew him before—we got almost tipsy together and I lost him—we went to a place in Montague-street—he said he would make me a present of the watch that he did not care much about it as it only cost him 2l JOHN NOAKES re-examined I had seen the sailor about twenty yards from the alley after the soldier came over to us—he was going towards Essex-street—the prosecutor was rather fresh when he came to me—he seemed in a very great state of confusion—I think he hardly knew what he was about he was so excited—he could hardly speak to us—I cannot say whether it was from liquor or fear—he was not so tipsy but he could walk as well as I can at present THOMAS REED sergeant of the prisoner Kellett s regiment deposed that he had been twelve years in the regiment that his habits were irregular but there was nothing against him for dishonesty DONAHOO— GUILTY Aged 51 KELLETT— GUILTY Aged 30 PICTON— GUILTY Aged 32 Transported for

his monies and at the time of such robbery striking and beating him JAMES STINT I am a labourer and live at Ruislip in Middlesex On the 12th of December I was going across Hillingdon-heath to my master s with three beasts about eleven o clock in the morning—as I went across the heath I saw five men all of a bunch—I did not know any of them before—I had a bundle under my arm containing clothes which I was going to take to my sister—they belonged to her—I had a canvas purse in my pocket with 7s in it—the five men were just by a turning which goes to Pollhill—I was following my beasts on the road—they were near the road—two of them the prisoners Steel and Williamson came across the road and met me—Steel put his band on my shoulder and said Farmer come and see if you can understand this game for I cannot —the answer I made him was I dare say you understand the game better than I do I have other things to attend to —I kept on following my beasts along the road and the two men kept walking along with me—Williamson then said Farmer go and bet him a sovereign and I will be your halves —three of them then surrounded me—George Clarke was tie other one—they tried to claw the bundle from under my arm but did not succeed—I hung to my bundle—I had the 7s in a purse in my breeches pocket—I had got my hand in my breeches pocket and had got my purse in my hand—Steel struck me across my arm with an umbrella knocked my hand out of my pocket and five shillings out of the seven shillings flew out of my purse on the ground—the purse fell on the ground too with the other two shillings in it—they clawed it up and ran away with it—Williamson and Steel clawed at it—I cannot say which got it—all five ran away Q What were the other two doing at the time the three were about you A One of them was sitting down by the side of the ditch and the other walking backwards and forwards by the side of the foot-path—they did nothing to me—they never came nearer to me than the footpath—they all ran away together—I hallooed out to the roadsmen and beckoned to them— they are people who mend the road —Bennett one of the roadsmen ran towards me—he might be about 300 yards off—I cannot say exactly—when I hallooed out Steel clawed a stick out of King s hand and said he would beat my b—brains out—King was one of those who had done nothing—he did nothing with the stick—he did not come up

29th of January I was going home with the articles stated in a bag—it was about ten o clock—I carried the bag in my hands over my arm with the string twisted round my wrist and round the mouth of the bag—I had got about fifteen yards from my house and was talking to a woman who I wanted to buy a pair of slippers of when the prisoner came behind me—he said nothing but pulled hold of my bag—I said What do you want of me —he said Give it to me —I would not and said What do you want of me —he took a knife out so quick so clever and cut it away—he cut the bag not the string and went away with the bag leaving the string and part of the bag in my hand—he went away very quick—I hallooed out Stop thief and ran after him but could not go fast as I had the rheumatism and I fell down and Sarah Burgess ran after him—I hallooed out My bag my bag and she said O the bag the property —I got up and ran on further and saw the prisoner when I got to the station-house when the rest of my bag and my property was produced to me—I knew it directly Q Was your little finger cut when the bag was cut A I found it cut—the prisoner cut it in cutting the bag—I think I had seen the prisoner a few weeks before in a public-house but not on that night—I think I have seen him at other times when I went to a public-house—I think he is the same man that cut my bag—on my conscience and sense I think he is the same man because every body said he was the man—my things are worth 20l —I had opened the bag while I was at Cockburn s house that night because I wanted to exchange a metal watch—I suppose the prisoner had followed me from there SARAH BURGESS I am the wife of George Burgess a mathematical instrument maker and live at No 16 York-street Mile-end Old-town A man who works for us brought home two pairs of shoes and in consequence of something I walked with him down Nottingham-place—I saw a man standing by the side of a wall there about a yard before I got to him—the prosecutor was going along and the man rushed out with great violence caught hold of his bag and said Give it to me —the prosecutor said Save my bag mistress save my bag —I attempted to do so but the bag was gone in a moment and I was afraid I should be cut—the prisoner is the man who did it—he ran away—I ran very fast after him into Charlotte-street—I am certain he is the man—I was not a yard from him all the time he was running—I could have caught hold of his jacket—I saw him run away with the bag and did not lose sight of him till he was taken only the moment while he turned round the corner and ran into the policeman s hands—there was no other man running in that direction—he called out himself Stop thief stop thief and I said That is the man stop him stop him —he had hardly got any distance before he was stopped—there was a mob of people running but he is the same man I followed from the beginning—I followed him from Nottingham-place through Charlotte-street just at the beginning of Whitechapel Prisoner Q What do you know me by A I am perfectly certain you are the person that cut the bag and you are the man I followed—I only lost sight of you one moment while you turned round into the policeman s hands Prisoner She said in her deposition that I was the length of one street from her and that she could not swear to me—I should like to hear it read COURT Q Is that your hand-writing A Yes— looking at her deposition —it was read over to me and I signed it and the same is in that as I have said to-day— the deposition being read stated I feel pretty sure he is the man but I cannot swear it Q You hear that you expressed a doubt there that he was the man A I know he is the man because I was not an ace from him—I could have caught hold of his jacket the whole of the way and as he turned round the corner the policeman caught him in a moment—I have no doubt in my own mind that he is the man—I only lost sight of him just as he turned the corner and the policeman caught him in a moment Prisoner The policeman said I was walking behind him in a narrow street about five or ten minutes before the job was done and the woman and man say I could not have passed them in the street without their seeing me—the prosecutor was as tipsy as he well could be Witness I do not think the prosecutor was tipsy—he had been drinking a little perhaps but was not tipsy EDWARD BLANEY

turned back and ran after him into Whitechapel—I lost sight of him for an instant and when I turned the corner I found him in the custody of Argent—he had nothing when he passed by me—the prosecutor and the witness Burgess were following him—the prosecutor charged him with this directly he came up and I thought he would have struck him with his stick—I looked about for the property and found it in Charlotte-street about twenty yards from Nottingham-place—the prisoner had run close by that spot—there was nobody running in the street except the prosecutor and the woman Burgess ISAAC FINKLESTON

my brother officer with the prisoner MATTHEW COCKBURN I am the son of Matthew Cockburn and live in White Hart-street Shadwell—On Monday the 29th of January between seven and eight o clock I saw the prisoner at our house—the prosecutor was also at our house at the bar—my father and he were talking some time about exchanging some watches—he showed his watches out of the bag and put them on the counter—the prisoner was there standing in front and could see what he produced but I did not observe whether he was looking at them Prisoner I have used the house two or three weeks ever since I have been out of employment ISAAC FINKLESTON re-examined My finger was cut but I do not think he did it on purpose—it was cut with a knife and was cut to the bone WM PARSONS re-examined I found no knife on

lived at Uxbridge—I was in the George inn-yard going home through the fields between ten and eleven o clock at night-as I proceeded along the footpath three or four men came up and knocked me down in the fields not a quarter of a mile from Uxbridge—I received a blow on my nose which caused it to bleed—I was knocked down and my eyes blindfolded-a man held his hand over my eyes and over my month—my arms were stretched out—I lost a silver hunting watch my hat and handkerchief and some silver—it was dark—I have since seen my watch in the hands of Birch the constable—I know it by the maker s name and an alteration in the case which I had done myself—I became insensible by the usage I received—I was almost suffocated by the blood flowing from my nose owing to my month being stopped and from the blood—I cannot identify any of the parties—I was blindfolded in a moment WILLIAM TYLER I am a licensed victualler and farmer On the morning of Sunday the 5th of November I saw the prisoner Hutchinson with another young man in my public-house at Watford—they came there about half-past eight o clock in the morning—that is about eleven miles from Uxbridge—they went into the tap-room-a person named Thomas Green applied to me for 10s which I lent him—I went into the tap-room about five minutes afterwards and saw the prisoner and another young man sitting in company with him close to one another—the prisoner was sitting close to Green—I did not see any thing pass between them—the prisoner and his companion had some beef-steaks and then went away a little before ten o clock-in consequence of suspicion I entertained I sent for two constables bat they came too late to stop them or I should have had them detained on suspicion of a murder at Hertford Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q The men for the murder at Hertford have been hanged A They had not then not both of them—I know nothing about any watch-to the best of my knowledge the other man had a fustian frock on—I had seen the prisoner before-a great many persons come to my place in the course of a day-from forty to fifty and from that to one hundred more or less—I know the prisoner was there that particular day because I took particular notice of him on account-of Green borrowing 10s on a watch—I asked Green to show it to me afterwards—the prisoner had a lapel coat on and to the best of my knowledge it was a dark green a pair of striped trowsers and a black hat—he ate his beef-steaks with his hat on—I had an ample opportunity of seeing his features—I went close to him and spoke to them several times—he had the steaks between nine and ten o clock—I heard the prisoner say he had had nothing since one o clock the day before—I am quite sure he was one of the persons—I never saw him again till I went to Uxbridge three or four months afterwards—it was on the 5th of November I saw him at my house-when I lend a man money I always put it down in the book—I am certain I am not mistaken in the day THOMAS GREEN I live at Watford in Hertfordshire I recollect Sunday morning the 5th of November—I can fix the date because the 5th of November was Sunday and next day I saw the bonfires—I went to the Bell public-house a little after-eight o clock—there were two young men together—the prisoner called me over to him and said Here old fellow will you buy a watch this morning —I said No I have no money to buy with how much do you want for it —he said I want 15s for it —I looked at it and said I would not give more than 10s if I had a pocket fall of money—I borrowed 10s of Tyler and paid it to the prisoner—this is the watch— looking at it —the prisoner took it out of his waistcoat-pocket and put it on the table—I afterwards delivered it to Birch the constable Cross-examined Q Were you always sure about the prisoner A Yes—I was certain of him before the Magistrate—I was put into custody for one night—that was before I gave evidence not afterwards—I have no doubt about his being the person—I have said that the other was taller than the prisoner and that there was a person in a fustian frock—that was not the prisoner—I have never said that the person with the person in the fustian frock was another person and not the prisoner—I had heard somebody call him White—I have never said that it was a man named White and another man in a fustian coat taller than the prisoner JOHN BIRCH I am constable of Uxbridge On Sunday morning the 5th of November I was fetched to the prosecutor—he gave an account of the robbery—he was then in bed—I went to Thomas Green at Watford on Good Friday the 13th of April—he told me where he got the watch from and produced it—I have produced the same watch to-day MR PAYNE to WILLIAM TYLER Q Have you got the book here what you made the memorandum A No we always put it on the slate and then I make my daughter put it into the book as well—I saw the date the day I went over to Uxbridge—I know the prisoner s features COURT Q How many were concerned in the Hertford murder A Four two were taken and two escaped and from the description I suspected the prisoner which makes me certain of him MR PAYNE Q Would the memorandum be rubbed out of the slate if it was put into the book A Not till it was put in—I looked into the book in April but Green paid me the money on the Sunday fortnight—I asked him if he knew the two men he bought the watch of—he said he knew the tallest but not the other—he said he had not seen the shortest above once before but the tallest he knew perfectly well—I asked him particularly whom he had the watch of—he said the shortest COURT Q Did he say that at the time A He did the next morning when he came in THOMAS GREEN re-examined I am quite certain that the prisoner is the man who gave me the watch DAVID RICE re-examined This is my watch and the same f lost—I know it by the maker s name and by this piece of silver which I put in myself MR PAYNE Q Is this your work A Yes—I am not in that line of business—I hammered it out of an old sixpence and it is fixed in the same as a glass MR PAYNE to JOHN BIRCH Q Did Green say any thing to you when the Magistrate was not present on the subject of the prisoner not being the person A No—he hesitated on the first day about knowing him and the second day but swore to him on the final examination Prisoner When Green came there on the Tuesday he was asked how I was dressed and he said it was a man pock-marked five or six inches taller than me Witness It was the other man he described as some inches taller and as being marked with the small-pox GUILTY Aged 21 —

see the police-sergeant till after it happened—the three prisoners ran away directly—the woman ran away first and after the men had stopped behind and struck me they went away also—I cannot say which took my money—I only missed it—I cannot say whether any hand was thrust into my pocket—I received a blow on my face the swelling has not gone down yet—I went immediately to Uxbridge and stated the case to Sergeant Cooper I went with him and met both the male prisoners and Buggey had my hat on his head—I described the marks on it before the policeman took it off—he took Buggey in custody—I took Cocking and they were taken to the station-house—the hat was produced to me—this is the hat— looking at it —the gloves have been found by the police-sergeant—these are them Buggey Q Did not we not walk across the meadows with you A I never saw either of them till they were on me-when you took my hat away I said I wish you would produce my hat-you did not take up a walking stick and give it to me DAVID COOPER I am sergeant of the police at Uxbridge On the night of the 19th of August I saw the prosecutor about half-past nine o clock and in consequence of information I accompanied him down the street and met both the male prisoners coming up the street—I and the prosecutor were passing under a lamp I believe they saw us coming and Buggey immediately crossed over the road at a quick pace—I told the prosecutor to lay hold of Cocking—I crossed and took Buggey and took him to the station-house—the prosecutor said That man had a cap on when he assaulted me and he has now a hat-if it is mine it has Artis Bond-street in it —I took it off and there was the name in it and he identified it—I took the prisoners to the station-house—I afterwards saw the female going down Uxbridge in company with another prostitute with a shawl over her head—I could hardly see her face but knew her before—I lilted the shawl on one side and took her—I had not seen the woman with the prisoners that evening—I asked Ann Cocking where her bonnet was—the said she had left it at the Jolly Ostlers JURY Q Was the prosecutor sober A Yes I had no reason to believe that he had been drinking—he appeared irritated—he described the men in such a precise manner I could not suppose he was drunk WILLIAM SERVANT I am a policeman of Uxbridge In consequence of information I went to the Jolly Ostlers public-house and obtained a bonnet in that I found a pair of gloves which I produce—the prosecutor described them before I found them—I took the bonnet to Ann Cocking and she said it was hers CHARLES PEARSON This hat and these gloves are mine Ann Cocking s Defence I first met the prosecutor by the Three Hounds—he passed me four or five times in the street and kept offering me money—I would not take it—at last by the George Yard he asked me merely to walk with him through the church-yard and who should I see in the yard but my husband and the other prisoner sitting down drinking out side the public-house-when I got to the meadows the prosecutor got behind me and told me to walk on slowly—I walked very gently—he came up behind me took hold of my clothes and flung them over my head and threw me on the ground—I hallooed three times and he put hit hand over my mouth and my husband came up to assist me—I took his gloves up as got up John Cocking s Defence The other prisoner and I were having a drop of beer my wife and the prosecutor passed us and presently I heard her halloo out—I ran and laid hold of his coat and said Hallo what are you doing to her —he got up and I struck him twice but never touched his money or any thing Buggey s Defence I had the hat given to me by two other chaps in the town—the prosecutor said he would give us half-a-crown to find his hat and we looked after it but could not find it—he went another way and just as we got into the town the hat was given to me Thomas West a sawyer of Uxbridge and Stephen West deposed to Buggey s good character ANN

monies and at the time of the said robbery feloniously striking and beating him JAMES STEVENS I live in Fenchurch-street On Sunday the 5th of August at half-past twelve o clock at night I was going home—I had drank a little but was perfectly sensible—I was the corner of John-street on my way home—the two prisoners were behind me-Brown came up to me on my left-side—he was a stranger to me—he struck me a blow in the mouth and as I turned round to see where it came from he struck me a violent blow on the back of my neck which knocked me down-as soon as I was down he commenced rifling ray pockets and the other man who was with him held me down the while—I cannot swear it was Bergoyne—he was a perfect stranger to me-Brown took from my right-hand pocket a comb and tobacco-box with two duplicates in it and from my left-hand breeches pocket a sixpence four shillings and one half-crown and a black lead pencil and four-pence in halfpence—that was all I had in the pockets-as soon as they had done that there was an old hat drawn right over my face—my own hat fell off when I fell down-Brown ran off with my hat and the other man ran away with him-no more blows were struck than I have mentioned—they left me on the ground—I got up and saw them running before me—they were about one hundred yards from me—I pursued them calling Police and Stop thief which they loudly repealed—I pursued them down the next street a policeman came round the corner and caught Burgoyne—I was about thirty yards from him then—I had gained on him—I cannot say how far they had run before the policeman caught Burgoyne—they turned up two or three turnings—the policeman gave Burgoyne to me while he pursued after the other who he caught and brought back to me-when the policeman left me Burgoyne resisted—he told me to let him go that he had done nothing—he twisted himself away from me and got on the opposite side of the way—I pursued him again and caught him-by that time the policeman came up with Brown and took them both to the station-house-from the effect of the blow I fell into a fit on the road to the station-house and did not recover for three quarters of an hour—I then found myself in the station-house and found I had lost my watch—I was not aware of that before I had the fit and cannot tell when it was taken—I know Burgoyne is the man who was running away but whether he is the man who robbed me I cannot say-when I missed my watch I immediately went over to Brown and said That is the man who has robbed me —he said something I could not say what-while I was down and he was rifling my pockets I saw his head hanging down right over my face and I recognised him by his red hair as well as his countenance-his face was so close to me I could not be off seeing him—it was a star light night—the street was lighted with gas but not very well lighted—it was a very dark spot—I was present when the prisoners were searched at the station-house-when the policeman brought Brown back to me he had my hat in his possession—I cannot say whether he had it on but it was in his possession—I had in my hand the hat they threw over my face and I changed with him—I took my own hat again from him and returned to him the one which was pulled over my eyes Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q At the office I think you said Brown and another man were behind—I think you did not see anything of Burgoyne till it was over A No Brown Q Where did you take the hat out of my hand A I cannot name the street not being acquainted with the quarter DANIEL HURLEY I am a policeman I was in Brown s-lane Spitalfields and heard a cry of Police and Stop thief —I immediately proceeded in the direction of the cry which was in Wood-street and observed the two prisoners and the prosecutor running and all three crying Stop thief —I ran and caught Burgoyne—the prisoned at first seemed both together but Burgoyne got in front of me—the prosecutor was twelve or fourteen yards behind them—I ran up for the purpose of delaying the prisoners till the prosecutor came up—I ran up and met them—they were between me and the prosecutor who was pursuing—I took Burgoyne back to the prosecutor and said Is this one of the fellows —he said Yes —I said Do you think you can hold him —he said Yes I can —I immediately ran after Brown and caught him at the top of Brown s-lane—I am sure he is the same man as I at first saw running away—he had never been out of my sight—he said I am not the person —I said You are one of the villains that robbed the man and immediately brought him back to where the prosecutor stood with Burgoyne—he said This is the man that hocked me down —I immediately collared Burgoyne and said they should both come to the station-house with me—the prosecutor had a hat in his hand—he gave it to Brown and took another hat from him saying it was his-Brown said nothing in answer—the prosecutor fell into a fit going along-directly he recovered he run over to Brown and said This is the villain who knocked me down —the prisoners were searched and I found on Brown two shillings a sixpence and twopence and on Brown five shillings a half-crown and threepence halfpenny and a black lead pencil Brown Q From what part of my person did the prosecutor take the hat A When I took him I was so agitated thinking he might let Burgoyne go I cannot say whether he had it on his head or not COURT Q At the time you searched Burgoyne did the prosecutor claim any part of the property as his A Immediately I took the pencil out of his pocket he claimed it as being his—the money was loose in his pocket JAMES STEVENS re-examined I lost a pencil—I saw the one found on Burgoyne and I will swear it is mine—it had been broken and I glued a piece of paper round it to preserve it—this is it— looking at it —the same paper is on it now Brown Q Did you receive any marks from the effect of the blow A A swelling came on the back of my head—I cannot swear I did not do that myself in the station-house while in the fit-you struck me with your right hand first and on the back of my neck with your left Brown I am a complete cripple with my left hand-is it possible I could strike him with it Q Did not you state at Worship-street that you could not swear we robbed you of your watch and money A No—I said I could not swear you robbed me of my watch but I did not say so of the money—I did not say at the station-house that I had lost 15s and that I had two half-crowns among them-as soon as I came to myself I felt for my watch and missed it Brown s Defence I was going home and heard the cry of Stop thief behind me-a policeman came running by me—he turned round and said I think you arc one of the villains who robbed the man and he took me to the station-house but I know nothing about it—the prosecutor says I knocked him down with a blow on the neck with my left hand and Ian a complete cripple with it—I cannot shut it Richard Mould journeyman silk velvet-weaver Little

convicted of felony ANN LEE I live in Devonshire-place Lisson-grove I have been out of place for about a month and have walked the streets—on a Sunday morning about three weeks ago between two and three o clock I went into a coffee-shop down Stingo-lane to have a cup of coffee—I saw the prisoner there—I did not know him before—he spoke to me and asked me to have some coffee—I said I had rather not I had some of my own—I went down to the corner of Wilmot-street—he followed me out and caught hold of me by the body and knocked me down—I got up again and asked him what he meant—he made me no answer but knocked me down again—I got up and he hit me in the face and knocked me down a third time—he then tore my frock from my arm down to my skirt and took two half-crowns two shillings and three sixpences out of my pocket—I caught his hand at my pocket and felt it about my thigh—after he knocked me down he put his foot right down my body—he stamped on me—I hollowed Police and murder and he was just running away a gentleman stopped him and the policeman directly came up and apprehended him-he said he was very sorry and if he had his liberty again he would kill me—I saw the policeman take him—I was only a little way from him—I did not lose sight of him—I kept up after him as fast as I could run—I had got the money that night-a gentleman gave it to me-as the prisoner look a shilling out of my pocket I took a shilling out of his hand as his hand was coining from my pocket and that I showed at the station-house—I am sure he stamped on my breast—I had a black spot on my breast and on my face—I did not show it to anybody—I told the police of it at the station-house—there was a mark on my clothes just where he put his foot right down my body Prisoner Did not I first meet you in the Grove where you stood with a young woman Witness I never saw you in my life till I went into the coffee-shop—there was a young woman there named Mary Caton—she was in before me—I did not walk arm-in-arm with you—I did not accompany you to a closet nor did you give me a shilling COURT Q Was there no talk about your going with him A No I would not have gone with him if he had offered me five shillings—I did not like the look of him—he did not make me any offer—he had the half-crown in his hand at the time I got the shilling from his hand-here were eight or nine people in the coffee-shop but I only spoke to the girl HENRY WILLIAM BOXALL I am a medical student and live in High Holborn On Sunday morning the 5th of August between two and three o clock I was in the New-road near Wyndham-place—I heard a female screaming Murder —I immediately ran to the place and found the prisoner running away towards the New-road and a female pursuing him—I called for a policeman—he came up and I gave the prisoner in charge—I did nothing to him myself—I ran against him and he stepped—the prosecutrix came up and accused him of robbing her of eight shillings and sixpence—he denied it but said he had given her a shilling to go with him-her gown was torn from her shoulder down to her pocket-her hair seemed very much disordered and her bonnet bent—I did not observe any marks on her breast—she complained of having been struck and stamped upon and said she had been thrown down three times—it was a dry night—I did not notice her dress whether it was dirty behind or not THOMAS KENNY I am a policeman On the night in question I was called for and came up in the New-road close to Lisson-grove—I heard the screams of a female between two and three o clock—I could not tell in what direction they were—I ran and saw the prisoner running as fast as he could at the top of Wyndham-street in the middle of the street—I put my hands forward and caught him in my arms-in about five minutes the prosecutrix came up apparently greatly fatigued with her gown torn from the right shoulder down to the waist—I asked her what was the matter—she told me the prisoner had robbed her of all she had in her pocket and threatened to have her life—I asked him was it so and his answer was he was sorry he did not murder her and if ever he got out of my hands he would murder her—he did not say why—I asked the girl in his presence what was taken out of her pocket—she said she had in her pocket two half-crowns two shillings and three sixpences and one of the shillings she snatched from his hand as he was robbing her—she gave me that shilling-while I was asking her about it the prisoner made several attempts to put his left hand into his left-hand trowsers-pocket—I prevented him and immediately took him to the station-house—on the way there he made several attempts to escape from me till I called another constable to assist me—the prosecutrix stated at the station-house in the presence of the prisoner myself Mr Boxall and the Inspector that she was robbed of two half-crowns two shillings and three sixpences and that one of the shillings she had in her hand was one of them—I was holding the prisoner s left hand at the time—I searched his left-hand pocket and found in it two half-crowns one shilling and three sixpences and in the other pocket 2s 8 1/2 d —the prosecutrix was unable to speak for a few minutes—she had been running some distance—I heard her screams for ten minutes before I took him—there was a mark over one of her eyes—the skin appeared to be broken—I did not observe any mark on her breast—it was a very dry night—I did not see any mark on her clothes—she said at the station-house that after she got up the third time he struck her with his clenched hand knocked her down and made his escape—he still kept saying all the time that he would murder her-when she said she took one of her two shillings from his hand he said that shilling he had given her to go with him—he said nothing more—he was very angry with me and said neither I nor two more constables should take him Prisoner Q Who gave me into custody A Mr Boxall—he ran to the girl pointed you out and I seized you—I heard her cries five minutes before you came up COURT Q Is it uncommon for girls of that sort to scream in the street A She screamed murder in such a curious way I really thought there was murder—she was perfectly sober and so was the prisoner Prisoner s Defence I met the woman at the corner of Devonshire-street with another female—she asked where I was going—I said Home —she said could I take her home with me for at the lodging she lived they would not allow her to take men home—she said at the station-house that she had been at a brothel in Stafford-street where a gentleman gave her the money she charges me with robbing her of—she asked me to accompany her to Oxford-street to sleep with her for the night—I refused—she then asked me to go to a coffee-shop which I did sad paid for two cups of coffee loaves and butter—after we came out I went down Stingo-lane with her—the inspector of police met us and a policeman named Thomas—I have sent for him but he has not come—we were going on arm-in-arm in the road and yet she swears I never met her till she got to the coffee-shop-at the office she said I had hold of her round the middle each time and now she says I struck her violent blows—I have only to say she is doing it for nothing else but to make a property and if yon will look at this paper it will prove it— producing one —it is a paper she has brought to my friends—she swore she would not come against me—it is my mother s writing and she gave her 9s 6d which was 1s more than she says she lost—I should like her asked about that ANN

money from me again—she gave me a silk handkerchief and I allowed her 2s 6d for that to make up the money—she gave me the money not to come against the prisoner—I did not say I would not come against him—I wanted to come all the time—I took the money and said nothing—I knew she meant it for me not to come—I did not say if she would give it me I would not come against him—she took me to three or four public-houses and made me spend every halfpenny of the 7s 6d in liquor—I got so tipsy I was taken to the station-house—this was about a fortnight after the prisoner had been taken up—the

t18381022-2481  2481 JOHN SULLIVAN was indicted for a robbery on Daniel Baseley on the 30th of September at St George the Martyr Southwark putting him in fear and taking from his person and against his will 1 watch value 27l 1 watch chain value 6l and 1 seal value 2l his goods and at the time of the said robbery feloniously striking and beating him MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution DANIEL BASELEY I live in Surrey-place Old Kent-road near to Surrey-square and am a cheesemonger On Sunday night the 30th of September I had been dining with a friend in Holborn—I was returning home between eleven and twelve o clock—I was in the New Kent-road near the Elephant and Castle on the left hand side of the way going from London—I met a friend and we proceeded as far as opposite Cumberland-place Old Kent-road together—we were then on the right hand side—the foot path is wide enough for five or six people to walk—on coming opposite Cumberland-place we saw several persons—one man came and pushed very violently against me and Mr Keeping and forced us to turn round—there was plenty of room for two or three people to pass on the wall side—Mr Keeping said there was sufficient room for all of us or something of that kind—the man instantly struck Mr Keeping a violent blow in the face which knocked him down and some man from behind instantly gave me a tremendous blow on the face and knocked me into the road—I had an umbrella which broke into three pieces in the fall—I attempted to get up and a struggle ensued between me and the prisoner and another— I am quite certain of his person and in the struggle the prisoner drew my watch which was scarcely exposed—my coat was buttoned and nothing but the seal could be seen—I struggled violently to save my watch and fought with him—we had several blows—he ultimately drew it from my person—it was a gold double-cased watch and gold chain and a very valuable watch—I cried out Police I have lost my watch —I expect the second man went to assist his companion who was with Mr Keeping—he ran away the instant I called Police and I collared the prisoner instantly—I never lost sight of him—he drew from me across the road—he did not get away from my hold then—he dragged me nearly across the road—Mr Keeping came and assisted me—we went on calling Police police and about Swan-street he got from my hold and ran down Swan-place into a court which is no thoroughfare and there I secured him—he had an opportunity of getting rid of the watch—he could not get out of Swan-place without jumping a ditch at the bottom which was very wide and had a paling—the police secured him there—he was scarcely three minutes out of my hold there—I cannot be mistaken in his person Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q About what length of ground do you think the party went until the prisoner was taken A A hundred and fifty or two hundred yards—search has been made but my watch has not been found—the prisoner might have given it to the other party at the time he took it—I could not see that he had an opportunity of giving it to any body at the moment—he drew it entirely from my person and I was persuaded that he put it into his pocket as he kept his hand in hit pocket—I think he could not have given it to any other person then—it was impossible—I had dined at three o clock that day with a party of friends—I had drank very little—perhaps five glasses of wine—I was quite sober—I was excited and frightened by this attack MR CLARKSON Q Were you so alarmed as not to be able to distinguish one man from another A Not the least—he was never out of my sight from the time of his getting away from me till I took him again WILLIAM JOHN KEEPING On Sunday evening the 30th of September I met my friend on his way home—we went together along the Old Kent-road and were run against by a man—there was quite sufficient room for him and another to pass—he appeared to run against the prosecutor on purpose—I said Surely there is room for us all to pass quietly —I immediately received a severe blow from the man who ran against the prosecutor—it knocked me down on the ground and as I was in the act of rising I received either a blow or a kick in my head—my friend was knocked over into the road by parties I had not previously seen—I saw two persons with him and the one was still in front of me—I had not an opportunity of observing the two that were with him but I can say that the prisoner is the man who I saw fighting with the prosecutor after the other two had ran away from me—there was a cry of Police—my watch my watch —the prisoner immediately ran away and we followed him across the road and came up to him immediately—we were not two yards behind him all the time—we went with him to Swan-street where I had hold of his arm and the prosecutor of his coat—he there made a violent struggle and got away—we still kept crying Police —he ran across the road and was going towards a place which used to be called Kent-street—he then turned down Swan-place but finding he could not get out he turned and said What are you following me for it is a pretty thing to be running after me in this manner —I am certain he is the man who had been fitting with the prosecutor—a policeman had followed us down Swan-street and secured him—I was quite sober Cross-examined A Did you turn any corners in the pursuit A Only into Swan-place—I was within two yards of him then—I did not meet any body in the pursuit—the prisoner had no opportunity of giving the watch to anybody—I saw him distinctly—I am not aware that he threw anything away—Kent-road is a very public thoroughfare COURT Q When you observed the prisoner fighting there had been a cry of Police—my watch A Yes previous to that WILLIAM FORDHAM police-constable R 175 On the 30th of September I was standing in Scott-street between twelve and one o clock and heard the cry of Police—I have lost my watch —I heard it repeated and immediately ran to the spot which was about two hundred yards—I saw the prisoner run down Swan-place Baseley and Keeping following him—I apprehended him as he was returning out of Swan-place—Mr Baseley told me where he was knocked down and there I found his hat and part of his umbrella Cross-examined Q This was at night between eleven and twelve o clock A Between twelve and one o clock I examined the ground that night and in the day but could not find the watch—I took my light to look for it immediately—the prisoner was running as hard as he could go when I first saw him Christopher Charles Thurston butcher 48 London-road Samuel

t18381217-353  353 JAMES NORTON was indicted for that he on the 23rd of November at St Giles s-in-the-Fields upon Gilbert Chesnutt feloniously did make an assault and feloniously did threaten him to accuse him of having attempted and endeavoured to commit with him the abominable crime of by with a view and intent thereby to extort from him divers of his monies and by intimidating him by the threat aforesaid did feloniously extort and gain from him 1 sovereign 1 crown 2 half-crowns 4 shillings and 2 sixpences his monies —2nd COUNT for robbery of the like monies —3rd COUNT for feloniously assaulting and demanding with menaces from the said Gilbert Chesnutt his monies with intent to steal them MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution REV GILBERT CHESNUTT I am a minister of the Church of England and am curate of Trinity Church Borough I reside in Trinity-square I came to reside in London about Whitsuntide 1831 and knew the prisoner four or live months afterwards—he is a tailor and I employed him to make clothes—that was the way I first knew him—he has not been in the habit of applying to me to lend him money until recently—he used to apply to me for orders but not very frequently—he first applied to me to lend him money about last Easter—he pleaded great poverty—I rejected him several times at last seeing him in distress I gave him a trifle—about three weeks before her Majesty s coronation I was coming out of my church and under the portico the prisoner came up to me and asked if I could not give him a job and if I could not to lend him or let him have money—I had lent him once before perhaps five or six shillings—I refused on this occasion and he said I have something very important to communicate to you and wish you to meet me at some place as it is something which affects your character —that was the first time he ever made any communication of that sort to me—I said There is nothing between us which calls for such a meeting and I shall not come —he then said You had better come if you do not you will rue the day as long as you live or words to that effect Q Did that have the effect on your mind to induce you to meet him A It had and I met him either that or the following evening I forget which near the Eagle-tavern City-road—when I saw him he said Walk this way —I followed him and after we got into rather a lonely place he said Can you not lend me some money or give me some money —I said You have no claim on me I cannot do so you can have no money from me —he then said I am now going to say something of very great importance to you and it is no use your calling out for help or giving me into the hands of the police for if you do remember I am armed—and if you do by G—d I will have my revenge and if you do not assist me I will say you took indecent liberties with me some time ago —he was exceedingly excited while saying this—he threw his arms about and used violent gesticulation—I thought he was going to attack me—it was a lonely spot—I was so completely paralysed and overcome I scarcely knew what I was about—I was induced in consequence of that threat to give him some money on the spot—I am not certain how much I gave him it was perhaps from ten to fifteen shillings Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Were you at all on terms of intimacy and conviviality with the prisoner A By no means—I never went with him to any tavern till three or four weeks ago when I was in such a state of intimidation I went into a respectable tavern near Tottenham-court-road merely to get rid of him not knowing what to do—I was not in the habits of intimacy with him—I was never in any tavern or place of that description with him before Easter—I never went by any other name—I have never walked arm in arm with him in the street Q Were you ever at his house before the time you speak of having given him that 10s or 15s A To give him an order for no other purpose—he came once to my house to solicit an order—that is the only time—he did not stay with me any time nor have any refreshment Q Have you a friend of the name of Hall A No—I know a clergyman of that name Q Had you any books belonging to your friend Mr Hall in your library A It is very likely I might have—I frequently have but I cannot say whether I had at that moment—I should not think I had any considerable number of his books—I am occasionally in the habit of receiving books from him—when the prisoner came to my house he first went into the parlour where my books are—I do not call it a library—I then went up into my drawing-room it was just before Easter when he began to be troublesome in soliciting money—that was before I paid him the 10s or 15s —as he was beginning to be troublesome I went up into my drawing-room and asked him what he meant by so frequently coming to ask me for money—I went up to the drawing-room as I did not know what be might say—he had become very troublesome then but he had not at that time made use of any threat COURT Q What do you mean by troublesome importuning you for money A Asking me to lend him money or give him a job MR PAYNE Q Did he appear in distress A He appeared very distressed and very shabby—I believe it was about four or five o clock in the afternoon when he came to my house—I did not tell him any thing about the books belonging to Mr Hall—we did not have any gin and water on that occasion nor on any other occasion—I never told him that I had obtained my appointment through my wife s brother—I never told him how I obtained it—I have the curacy of Trinity Church—my wife s brother solicited it

orders when I first came up to town Q You say you were extremely paralysed and completely overcome and scarcely knew what you were about—how came you to go to that lonely spot A He said Walk this way —I was under the intimidation of the meeting—he made the demand that I should meet him Q At that time he had not charged you with any thing A He had told me it was a circumstance affecting my character and I should rue the day if I did not meet him Q Why not tell him he might as well tell you there what it was A I was under great intimidation—he had before solicited for orders or money Q Were you afraid of any blow being struck A I was—he was close to me—he did not strike me at all but he threw his arms about and made actions as if he was going to attack me—I gave him the money within two or three minutes of his saying he would charge me with indecent liberties Q Did you give him the money fearing he would make a charge of that kind or from fear that he would strike you in that lonely place or from both jointly A Both jointly COURT Q From personal fear and the attack on your character A Yes—he had told me he was armed MR PAYNE Q He did not produce any pistol A No—I saw no

coffee-shop—I read him the warrant on which I apprehended him and then he said I never accused Mr Chesnutt of any crime whatever nor did I intimidate him for the purpose of obtaining money from him—the money I have received from him he gave to me because he knew I was in distress —I went to him on the Wednesday before at the same place with my brother officer Jones and heard him ask the prisoner what charge he had against Mr Chesnutt or what it was he wanted of him—he said he had no charge whatever to make against him REV G CHESNUTT re-examined by MR BODKIN Q As a clergyman and on

whether they shut the door after them or not—the man who came in first immediately threw me backwards on the end of the sofa which was just inside the parlour-door and my head went through a square of glass in a window at the back—it made a great rattle—I screamed Murder three times and said For God s sake don t murder me if it is money you want I have that for you —the man immediately put his hand on my face and forced three of his fingers into my mouth—his hand was as rough as a brick and his fingers stopped my breath—one of them was a youth—I cannot speak to their persons as I was in the dark but a glance of light came from the fen-light and the one I had the most sight of was the one not in custody—the man who stood second took a bed-pillow off the sofa to prevent my screaming clapped it over ray face held it down with his two hands and at the same time I saw him by a glance through the fan-light take a penknife out of his pocket—the man who knocked me down directly said No you b— you

Whitcombe-street Leicester-square at Mr Saphill s who married my sister—I am a working jeweller in the employ of Brown and Kay manufacturing jewellers Tavistock-row and have been nearly eight years in their employ On Monday the 30th of September I was walking to my lodging from Brown and Kay s between seven and eight o clock in the evening I think nearer eight and saw the prisoner Henry—I stopped to look at some books at a shop in St Martin s-court and he came up and remarked on the cheapness of them—I said they were so—I put the book I had in my hand down and walked on to Leicester-square—he walked with me as far as my own door and then wished me good night—he had followed me and entered into conversation—on the evening of the 1st of October I had just come from my own house to go out for a walk after business about half-past eight o clock—I was passing down my own street and at the corner of James-street Heny came up to me and said How do yon do sir —this was about four houses from my own house—I acknowledged the compliment and walked on—he followed and entered into conversation with me—I went down the street towards Charing-cross and passed on through Charingcross past the Horse-guards—he still continued walking with me—I kept straight on down the street towards the front of Westminsterabbey not Parliament-street hut the street on the right hand side—I went on down Dean-street and when we got down Dean-street near the corner of Peter-street he seemed suddenly to recollect himself and he remarked that a friend and himself were going to open an eating-house that the men were at work on the premises and be would go and see how they got on and would I go with him—I went with him to No 66 Peter-street as I have since ascertained it was about the middle of the street—when we got to the door he took a key from his pocket and opened the side door in the passage close to the street door—he went in first I did not follow him immediately—I did not intend to go in but he turned round and asked me to step in which I did—the moment 1 had stepped in he closed the door and seizing me by the collar said Now you are in my power —there was a candle burning on a little shelf in the corner in the shop which was under repair—there were workmen s tools there—I said What do you mean —he said I will show you what I mean let us see what you have about you —I struggled with him to get loose—he said it was of no use he would call the police and give me in charge for unnatural practices if I attempted to make the least noise—he then tore open my waistcoat and trowsers turned my pockets inside out and took from my trowsers pocket 1 sovereign 1s 6d and some halfpence—at that moment 1 heard footsteps in the passage and a man s voice call out Henry —Henry did not answer and I heard footsteps go to the back of the house and I saw Taunton throw open a sash-window and come into the place where we were—I am certain he is the man—Henry was about removing my watchguard from my neck at the time he came in—it was a black ribbon—Taunton said Holloa Henry what have you got there —Henry replied Oh it is all right a regular b - - —after that Henry proceeded to take the rings from my fingers—I resisted him rather faintly I confess for I was in great trembling and fear—Taunton then said he would fetch in the policeman and give me in charge—Henry said Oh never mind let him go we have got all we can —he let go of me and I then made my way into the street and got home as well as I could Q At the time the property was taken from you were you or not put in fear by the conduct of the prisoners A I was decidedly so—I am quite certain the prisoners are the two persons—I did not give information to the police from the great dread I had of the charge they threatened to bring against me if 1 did—that was the only reason—it was from nothing more than the dislike of having my name mixed up with the imputation Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When did you have Henry taken A On Wednesday the 16th—Taunton was taken after that—I was present when he was taken by Cooper—I found him in his shop—it is an eating-house—it is the same place I was at—it was undergoing repair at the time I was there first-all I saw of Taunton was during the tine he came in at the window and till I got out—I am positive the words Henry used were It is all right a regular b— they are too fully impressed on my mind to forget them—I am quite positive they were the precise words—I have not strengthened my recollection at all since they were apprehended—I never said it was to that effect to my recollection—I gave the words repeated by the prisoner—I am quite confident of the words—it—was six weeks afterwards that I first gave an account of the words he used—I did not make a memorandum of them—I am quite certain Taunton said he would give me in charge—I have always been quite sure about that—I was very much confused and agitated—the door of the room could not have been fast for directly I put my hand against it it opened outwardly—I did not say he locked the door—I said he closed it—that has always been my opinion—I struggled with Henry before Taunton came in—we did not make much noise except the noise of our feet—it was after that that Taunton came in at the window—I never saw Taunton from that time till he was taken into custody—he never came to me nor asked for any thing—I had never seen him before to my knowledge COURT Q Do you know whether Henry lives in the same place A I do not know but I ascertained after he was apprehended that he lodged at the Horse and Groom public-house in Bedfordbury—there was light enough for Taunton to see what Henry was doing and he did see it—he was coming in at the window at the time Henry was taking my watch from my fob—he saw him take the rings from my fingers—he took a gold mourning-ring from the little finger of my right-band a wedding-ring and another ring from the little finger of my left-hand—Henry afterwards told me his friend had the money and he only had what he could make by pledging the watch and rings—he also said he knew what he was doing was very wrong and he knew very well I could transport him for it but he did not care for that he had no friends nor any character to lose and he had no trade Q How came you to make this charge afterwards against the prisoners for robbing you at this house A By his coming to my employer s house and demanding money—that induced me to make the circumstance known to my employers Henry The witness speaks false—did you not lock the door yourself when you went into the room Witness Certainly not DAVID COOPER I am a policeman I took Henry into custody by the advice of my superintendent on Saturday the 16th of November—I also went and took Taunton—I found him at No 66 Great Peter-street—I have known the house for above twelve months—it was open as an eating-house when I took Taunton—he had opened it about nine weeks—I told Taunton what I took him for—I took him to the station-house in Newway Westminster—I did not at any time tell him it would be better for him to confess or worse if he did not—he denied the charge—he said he did not know Mr Poulson at all—Poulson was with me at the time—I then took Taunton to Bow-street station-house—he then told me he recollected the gentleman and seeing him at his house with the prisoner Henry that he heard a noise in the room and went and tried the door and found it fast—that he entered at the window came into the room where Poulson and Henry were and he said he Taunton used threatening

him for did not he say he was very willing to go with you A Yes I did not think of that before—I did not know this house as an eating-house before the Sunday—I knew the house because I had lived there

walk with a perfect stranger to you A I cannot account for it—I had no object in view—when I got to the house the street-door was open—I did not open the side-door nor did I lock it—there was a candle already lighted when I went into the room—it was on a little shelf in the corner—nothing whatever of an indecent nature took place between us—my shirt was not out—Inever had the key of the door in my hand—the next time I saw the prisoner was on Friday evening the 15th of November and when I saw him he told me not to be frightened he only wanted a little money seeing I was agitated I suppose—I gave

in fear and danger of her life and feloniously stealing from her person and against her will 1 purse value 1s 1 half-crown and two shillings her property FANNY LISETTE ELIZABETH WORTLEY NAINB I am single and keep a preparatory school for young gentlemen in Canonbury-place Islington On the evening of the 5th of March about seven o clock or a few minutes after I was walking with two of my pupils Wilkinson and Fortescue who are both eleven years old through Canonbury-field—it is a regular highway—I overtook a man who stopped when I came near him drew a little on one side and said I will thank you for some money —I said I have none to give away —he then went behind me and on coming to the other side he said I have been told you have and I must have some —I said I have a few shillings only in my pocket and felt in my pocket—he came close to me showed me a pistol in one hand and held the other for my purse or whatever money I had—I gave him my purse on seeing the pistol from fear—he held the purse up on my giving it to him went behind me and went away—it contained half-asovereign and two or four shillings I am not certain which—I had not the opportunity of noticing his face but I noticed his figure—I did not notice his voice particularly I was too much frightened—the prisoner was thinner when I saw him at Hatton-garden than when I saw him in the field but from his general appearance I then thought it was him and I am of that opinion still—I did not see his face as I had rather a thick veil down and he kept rather on one side Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q What time was this A A few minutes after seven o clock on Thursday the 5th of March—I am quite sure of that—he held his hand for the money—I did not recollect at the moment whether I had my parse or my money loose in my pocket but I felt my purse and I gave it him which I should not have done but for the pistol—he did not threaten me but he frightened me as much as if he had threatened me—he did not say he was distressed nor any thing like it—he stood by my side and held the pistol in his band—I only saw the barrel of it—I saw the whole of the barrel not the stock—I did not see the lock nor the handle Q How could you tell it was a pistol A From my observation of it—I saw the barrel and the mouth—there are other tubes like a pistolbarrel but I think decidedly this was a pistol—he showed it to me to intimidate me—he did not tell me it was a pistol nor tell me he would do any thing to me with it—the mouth was not turned towards me—I saw the wood that supports the barrel—I bad my veil on at the time—It was not a very indistinct view that I had—my veil is not a very thick one—I have the same on now—I wear it to exclude the air being subject to a cough—it was dusk—I will not swear it was a pistol-barrel COURT Q Were you impressed with that notion by seeing a barrel supported by wood as a pistol is and the month also A Yes—we had crossed from Paul s-terrace—it struck seven o clock when we came to the end of Paul s-terrace which makes me know it was very little after seven o clock FREDERICK FORTESCUE I am eleven years old—I am a pupil of Miss Nainby s and live with her I was with her on the 5th of March in Canonbury-field—we passed through Paul s-terrace in our way—I noticed a man in Paul s-terrace it was the prisoner—I am certain of him—he turned round and looked at us which made me look at him—when we were walking across Canonbury-field he was walking before us then he went behind and said he would thank Miss Nainby for some money—she said she had none to give him—he then came before her and showed her the pistol and she gave him the money—I saw the pistol—I noticed the barrel and the lock—I noticed his features—I had seen him before on Paul s-terrace and knew him to be the same man—I was noticing him when he produced the pistol and had the purse from Miss Nainby—I was alarmed which made me look at him more—it did not take long—I positively swear he is the same man—I have no doubt about it Cross examined Q It was dark was it not A Nearly dusk—he had his finger on the trigger when Miss Nainby was going to give him the money—I could see the flint distinctly—I could not see the handle he had it in his hand—when I saw him in Paul s-terrace he was idling about walking slowly—I had never seen him before that night—it was about five minutes between our being in Paul s-terrace and seeing him in the field—there is no light in Canon bury-field—he had a light flannel jacket on and dark trowsers—I saw him in custody about a week after or perhaps more JOHN WILKINSON I am eleven years old—I live with Miss Nainby On a Thursday evening I was in Canonbury-field when a man spoke to her—he said I will thank you for some money —Miss Nainby said she had none to give away—he came to her side and said I have been told you have some and I must have it —he then presented the pistol and she gave him her purse—I had seen the same man before on Paul s-terrace and noticed him—he turned round and looked at us as we passed and when he got behind us he stood and looked at us—he had a flannel jacket on—the prisoner is the man I am quite clear about it—I had not hold of Miss Nainby s hand—I was walking on one side and Miss Nainby in the middle—the prisoner came on the side I was on when she gave him the purse Cross-examined Q He presented the pistol did he A He had it in his hand—he held it—he did not hold it before Miss Nainby—I did not see where he got it from—he did not have it in his hand on Paul s-terrace and I do not think he had it in the field at first—he had it when he said I will thank you for some money —it was dusk—I saw him afterwards at the police-office—I was told I was to go to see the man who bad robbed Miss Nainby—I went and knew him to be the man—Miss Nainby told me I was to go to see the man that robbed her—they showed me nobody but the prisoner COURT Q When you saw him did you recognise him A Yes directly—I expected to see the same man and when I saw the prisoner I knew him to be the same MR PRENDERGAST called RICHARD CHANDLER I am the prisoner s brother and am a shoemaker and live at No 1 Windsor-street The prisoner is a shoemaker—he follows the trade with me On Thursday night the 5th of March he was at home working with me—he was working with me at seven o clock—we had more work than usual having a fresh shop to work for which made me very busy—we worked very late in the evening till we went to bed—I am certain he was not out of my house at all on the Thursday—he went out for a few minutes on Wednesday into the adjoining street—he was not gone above a few minutes—I am quite certain he did not leave the house on Thursday—he never wore a flannel jacket—the officer came to my house to search for one but nothing of the sort was found—I am a married man COURT Q When did you take the house No 1 Windsor-street A About six weeks ago—I have only two rooms—I took them on the last Monday in February but I have lived in the same street five months—I moved on the Monday—I have been there about five weeks—I had two shops to work for which made me take the two rooms—I know it was the Monday before March that I went into the rooms—I got work the beginning of the week after I got there—I begin work at seven o clock in the morning sometimes before—my brother was taken up three weeks ago last Monday—I think it was a fortnight after the fifth of March—I do not recollect the day of the month—I got more work on the day my brother was apprehended—it is very seldom I keep the day of the month—I speak to this day because I recollect I got some more work—there was a strike with some shoemakers and they left the shop on a Monday—I went to the man and he gave me more work—that was in the week that it is said these ladies were stopped—I know it by the 4th of March being Ash Wednesday—he went out into the next street for a trifle that was owing—we began work at seven o clock that Thursday and finished at eleven o clock—he never went out of the house from seven to eleven o clock only into the back-yard—he was not absent five minutes—Paul s-terrace is I should think a mile and a half from Windsor-street or better and Canonbury-field about a mile—I live not quite half a mile from the City-road—the prisoner dined at my house that Thursday and drank tea and breakfasted there also—Britannia-fields is close by where I live—my brother was at home with me on the 16th of March till he was taken in the evening Q Then from the Monday in February up to the 16th of March he had never been out an evening A Never except on Wednesday evening when he went out to get a trifle that was owing to me in the next street—that was the only time he left my house in an evening—he lodged with me and slept in the back-room—I slept in the front-room—we first worked in the back-parlour but the weather being cold we took to work in the front-room—my brother came to me from a Mr Lickfold—I never walked out with my brother—I was always obliged to work very hard not on Sundays and all but I was always at home on Sundays and my brother too—he never went out of an evening—if he went out he went out of a morning Q Now recollect yourself about the 16th of March A I never keep the day of the month—he might have been taken then—I do not know whether he was taken that evening—I do not know the day of the month—I know the Monday evening he was taken—I know he was caught in our street by an officer ANN CHANDLER I am the wife of the last witness I remember Ash-Wednesday—the prisoner was at our house that week at work with my husband—he was at home on the Monday of that week—he was not out that day nor Tuesday—on Wednesday he was out a little in the evening I think between eight and nine o clock—he was not out at all on Thursday I am quite sure—he could not have been out without my knowledge because I am always in the room with them—I live in the same room as they work—he was not out at all that evening—he had lodged with us about four months on this occasion—we lived at No 33 in the same street—he had been with us in both houses—I never saw him wear a flannel jacket—I never saw such a thing on him—the officers searched our house to find one but they could not find it—I am positive we never had such a thing in our house—he slept in our house and got his meals with us—he had a box in which he kept his things—that box was searched by the officers—no part of his clothing had been put out of the way—we had no idea that he was taken COURT Q He was taken in your street was not he A Yes but we did not bear of it till the officers came which was I think the same afternoon—I went to the police-court and was examined by the Magistrate in the presence of the prosecutrix and stated what I have now MISS NAINBY re-examined I saw this witness and her husband before the Magistrate I saw the prisoner in the field a few seconds before he stopped—he was ahead of me—there are two roads one that we went and a road that goes straight by the side of the field and I think he came suddenly on us before us—we had got about two thirds across the field—I think he went in a different direction to us to the same spot—it is a large open space—there is a road by the side—it is not two minutes walk from Paul s-terrace to Canonbury-field—it is merely across a bridge by the New-river—we did not appear to be following him any time before I saw him—he suddenly appeared before us Charles Lick fold cheesemonger Windsor-street Islington and John Mallett shoemaker Liverpool-road Islington gave the prisoner a

when I was in Portman-square—I had a reticule in my hand twisted round my arm and the cord round my two fingers—a man threw his person upon me almost felled me to the ground and dragged at my reticule

standing by the chapel—I called out Come and help me there A thief—she stood like a statue and never moved—he afterwards joined that woman—he did not leave me when I called out but he squeezed my

man I am quite sure—I held him till the policeman got him—he said What have I done Let me go I have done nothing and began wrestling with me—the prosecutrix came up after I had him a little while but some children ran up first and said he had stolen a bag—the lady then came up and said all she wanted was her bag and the money would not do him any good and soon after the policeman came—the prisoner

to be searched—she said she would not go to the station-house but if he had the bag to give it up that was all she wanted—I let him go as there was nobody to charge him and she would not give her name or address or any thing—about twenty minutes afterwards as I was going round my beat I saw him going along Adam-street—he looked down the different areas knocked at No 25 and went down with the lady

regimentals and his side-belt and when I saw him again he had a white jacket on and a leather cap JANE HAWKINS My husband is a soldier in the 2nd battalion of Scotch Fusileer Guards on duty at the

serjeant-major who told us to go home and go to bed—he told the prosecutor to go home and if there was any thing wrong to come in the morning COURT Q Then they were drinking together were they A Yes—I did not think it odd that the prisoner should say to him Am I the man —I might as well have asked it as I was drinking with them—I cannot say whether the prosecutor lost a watch at all—I did not rob him—there were five or six soldiers and five or six girls drinking in the first public-house—it is generally the case when we go into barracks in the evening to put off our red jacket and put on a white one WILLIAM MARCHANT I was in the public-house that evening when the prosecutor came and said he had lost his watch—he asked Lay and Wilton if they had not been drinking with him—Wilton asked if

immediately before and at the time of said robbery feloniously beating striking and using other personal violence to him and that Rosser had been before convicted of felony MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM DOUST On Saturday the 19th of December I was gardener to Mr George Halfhide of Clare Lodge Perry-hill Sydenham I left Perry-hill that night about five o clock as near as I can guess—I had received 24s my wages that night and had 6s 6d in my pocket besides and also a watch—that was all I had with me—my way home leads me through Southend-lane which is in the parish of Lewisham—I got to Southend-lane about half-past five o clock—I met one man in Southend-lane following a dung cart—it was neither of the prisoners—I was going to my lodging at Southend—when I got about a mile up Southend-lane I was stopped by two men—I first passed one of them and he gave way to me on my right—it was very dark—after I passed him I turned round to look who it was—he had got something black over his face—as I was turning round to look at him I received a severe blow on the temple from something very heavy and blunt—I was not at that time able to distinguish the features of either of the men—it knocked me down and partly stunned me—I asked them what they wanted and they stuffed something into my mouth—I was sensible enough to see that there were two persons—I got up as soon as they left me I arose with them—when I asked what they wanted they did not speak at all but stuffed something into my mouth—I felt a great pressure on my stomach and felt their hands at my watch—I put my hand down to save my watch and found the ribbon was broken—the pressure on my stomach was like somebody kneeling on me or something like that—I was not entirely sensible and not able to make the least resistance—I do not think they remained on me more than a minute—I should think I recovered myself half an hour after and I found I had lost a sovereign a half-sovereign a sixpence and 2 1/2 d a bunch of four keys and a ring and a bag the money was in—the money was all in a bag—my watch was also gone—I arose with them as well as I could and ran a few steps but fell down again—I arose again and fell again directly and found I could not pursue them and then I quite lost myself and did not know where I was for half an hour—as soon as I came to myself I found the injury I had received on the head—I did not bleed much—I lost my way through the state I was in but at last I got into the lane—I happened to take the right turning and went on—I came to Sydenham—I there saw a policeman and told what had happened—it was about six o clock I was told or a little after—when I had sufficiently recovered myself I accompanied Mr Kemp a miller at Southend to where I was robbed to see if 1 could find any thing and I found the stick now produced lying down on the spot where I had been lying—the weather had been very heavy and dark for a few days before and there was snow on the ground—I also picked up part of my ribbon and the key of my watch and a black stock which had come from a man s neck a few paces further—I delivered that to the constable—I was quite unconscious who the persons were who did this—I know the prisoner Smith quite well—he had been in the service of my employer Mr Halfhide—he left the service about twelve months ago last August in hay-time 1839—it has been my habit for four years to leave work on Saturday night and go to my lodging—Smith was quite aware that that was my practice and he knew very well that I had a watch—he was aware that it was my habit to receive my wages on Saturday and come home at five o clock—I know Rosser quite well—he had not been in Mr Halfhide s service but I have known him six or seven years—if either of the prisoners had been there and spoken while I was sensible I believe I should have recognised their voices well—neither of them spoke during the attack but one said hem—on the following day Sunday I went with the policeman Kirby to the spot— I do not think I made any effort while on the ground —I think I had a piece of paper with me when I left my master s but I am not certain—there was a piece of paper with lines drawn and figures and I turned it over and saw something on it—I recollect the word fines or sewers —one side was printed—the figures were written—the fines and sewers were in print—there was nothing else that I recollect on the paper—I think I had last looked at that paper on the Sunday before the Saturday of the robbery—I had got it from the brewhouse—I took it and put it into my pocket then and have not any recollection of it afterwards—Kirby showed me a piece of paper after the robbery—it was the paper I had put into my pocket the Sunday before—this is it now produced—I attended before the Magistrates at Greenwich on the 28th of December—after the case had been partly inquired into the prisoners were put back into the cells at the back of the Court I was walking in the yard near those cells and while doing so Rosser called to me—I went up to him—Smith was not in that cell—I cannot say whether he was within hearing—Rosser said to me I am very sorry for what I have-done —I said I could hardly believe you were the man —I did not tell him why but I thought he would not have committed such a thing—I asked him where my watch was—he told me it was in the Black Horse stables in the first stable on the right-hand going up the yard—I went to that spot in company with Walker the constable the same evening and in the first stable on the right-hand side I saw Walker find the watch which I had lost that Saturday night—the one produced is it—the cook had given me half a sovereign—I gave her 4s and I was to bring her 6s the next morning Smith He cannot say it was me—I do not know what reason be has to think it was me JOHN BECKWAY I am a haybinder and live at Catford-hill Beckenham On Saturday the 19th of December I left my work at Mr Egerton s about a quarter after four o clock and came in company with the prisoner Smith on my way home almost a mile to the road which leads to Catford-hill and turns up opposite the Black Horse public-house—I parted with him there—the Black Horse is at Rushey-green in Lewisham parish—I went up Catford-hill—he appeared to me to be going past the Black Horse as he was on the contrary side of the way but I did not turn back to see if he went to the Black Horse or not—I think the Block Horse is about two miles from where the prosecutor was robbed but you might cross the fields—I left Smith at about twenty minutes to five o clock JOSEPH COLBORN I am ostler at the Black Horse public-house Rushey-green—I know the prisoners On the 19th of December our pot-boy was absent in consequence of which I had to do his work from the 14th to the 19th and Rosser came to assist the other ostler in cleaning out the stables during that time—on Saturday afternoon the 19th of December I saw the prisoners at the Black Horse standing outside the door together just at the side of the tap-room window—that was just before five o clock—they were standing talking together—Smith went and lighted his pipe and went across the road towards Catford hill—I did not observe which way Rosser went—I saw nothing more of them till I went out with my beer at six o clock—I then saw Rosser in the tap-room—I do not know whether he had any right to be absent between five and six o clock WILLIAM SHILLING I am one of the ostlers at the Black Horse public-house Rushey-green—I employed Rosser to help me to clean out the stables on the Saturday in question—I saw Rosier that evening and gave him some beer and bread and cheese it was then just at dusk—I saw him again that evening—I go home of a Saturday night at seven o clock to bed being up all the week and I saw him in the front of the house and gave him 2d to get a pint of beer to look if any thing pulled up in front—I did not see Smith there then—I had seen him a little before five o clock that evening in front of the house—he spoke to me—Rosser told me that afternoon while he was cleaning out the stable he was not in any employ at that time and that he was going to work on the Monday—he said he had been out of employ several days—I think our clock is generally a little fast ROGER HAVARD I am an inspector of the R division of police stationed at Lewisham On Saturday the 19th of December about half-past six o clock I received information of the robbery—I went to Doust s house that evening and got from him this stick or stake which I produce and this black stock—on Sunday morning I saw Smith passing opposite the station-house door—I sent a constable to call him into the station and asked him where he was on Saturday evening—he said he came down from Southend to Rushey-green between four and five o clock in company with a man named Beckway whom he left at Rushey-green by the Black Horse public-house and then he went down Lewisham for the purpose of seeing a man named Homeward to whom be had sold a donkey—he went as far as the Rising Sun and there met a man who informed him that Homeward was not at home consequently he did not go any further but returned home to nurse his family—I asked him who the man was that informed him that Homeward was not at home—he said he did not know—I then asked him what money he had—he said Only a few halfpence —I desired him to pull them out—he pulled out 8 1/2 d in copper—I asked him if that was all he had—he said no he had half-a-sovereign which he pulled out of his pocket wrapped up in a piece of light brown sugar-paper—I asked him where he had got the half-sovereign from—he said he had earned it and gave change to a man for it at Bromley in the street— this paper which I have in my hand contains a few questions which I put down—I put them down the day after—this other paper is a similar memorandum merely putting it down shortly—I made that directly after the other—the larger memorandum I made the day after I apprehended Smith previous to going before the Magistrate—at the time I made it all these matters were fresh in my mind—I put it down for that purpose—I am certain what I have stated is correctly what passed —I asked him who that man was who he gave change to in the street—he said he did not know—he afterwards said he had pledged a coat and waistcoat on the Tuesday previous for 10s and had given his wife on the Tuesday 2s or 3s from that money—he then recollected himself and said he did not give his wife any on the Tuesday but gave her 5s or 6s on the Saturday which was the day of the rubbery and with the remainder he purchased herrings apples nuts and oysters—I then desired him to take off his shoes which I produce—I went with Doust to the spot where he said he had been robbed I there found the impressions of men s shoes—the snow was then quite thick on the ground—this right shoe has only half a plate on the toe the other has a whole plate—there are six rows of nails in the soles and eight nails in the middle of the heel all of which exactly corresponded with the impressions—I made a corresponding mark by the side of those that were there and also put the shoes into some of them—in the impressions I found in the snow there was the absence of the portion of the tip on one of the shoes—those that I found exactly tallied with those that I made—the shoes are rights and lefts and so were the impressions—I ascertained the numbers of rows of nails in the impressions quite plainly before I put the shoes into them—I feel confident that these shoes made the impressions I found—I traced the impressions across the fields into the foot-path that leads into the Southbend road which is the turnpike-road to Bromley—I know where Smith then lived—I traced the impressions in the direction to Smith s house and within 250 yards of it—it is full half a mile from the place where the robbery was committed to Smith s house the way they went across the fields—the impressions were quite plain across the fields as well for I made corresponding marks along the road—I afterwards went to Smith s house—I there found this bill-hook in a cupboard in his bed-room—it has a rough edge and is notched—I afterwards compared it with the stick that was given me by Doust and it is my impression that it was cut by this bill-hook—I tried two marks on it to the stick and they exactly fitted—the stick had been partly cut and then knocked down—when I looked at the bill-hook it was my impression that it had cut the stick but I had not the stick with me then—here is a chip in the stick which corresponds with a notch in the bill-hook—I only speak as far as my impression goes—I saw nothing of the prisoner Rosser until Monday the 28th after he had been examined before the Magistrate a second time—he then stood committed but was remanded for a fortnight—he was in the inspector s room about to be removed to Magistone—he said he wished to tell of the whole affair—I said nothing to induce him to make a statement nor did I threaten him in any way—I not only cautioned him that whatever he might say would be taken down and made use of against him but I told him he had better not say any thing—he was likewise cautioned by my superintendent and the Magistrate s clerk not to say any thing and told that what he said would be taken down in writing and be used against him—he did make a statement which I took down from his lips without asking a question and after I had done so he put his name to it—this is the statement he made— reads — Abouta month ago Smith came to me when I was at work at Bromley and said he wanted some money and said he knew of a chance—that Doust the gardener in coming home on Saturday night had always 33s or 34s with him besides a watch he knew what time he came down the lane and wanted me to come with him—I said perhaps I might but I went another road to miss him—I saw him on the Monday following and he asked me how it was I did not come I said I worked too late—he then said he would meet me on the following Saturday night I said I should see him again before then I saw him in the middle of the week and he said Will you go with me next Saturday night I said You meet me by Southend somewhere which I did not—when I saw him again he said You are not a man of your word I told him it was so light I was afraid of being found out Then I don t think I saw him for a week afterwards when I again saw him he said It will be darker next Saturday night will you go I said I did not expect I should be in work and I should see him about somewhere On the Saturday it was done he was going to London in the morning he said I shall see you when I come back when he came from London he said I shall be down by and by He came down to the Black Horse about dusk and went in and lighted his pipe—he came out again and said Come on let us go and he went up the walk opposite the Black Horse and I followed him In going across the fields he took his hand-bill out and cut the stake off from the side of the hay-stack—we both went across into the lane and Smith said we had better go lower down the lane as it would be darker there—then two men came along and Smith said That is not him —after they had passed Smith said be would knock him down and Smith gave me his apron to put in his mouth and said he would take the watch and money he bad got—presently the gardener came along and he said Here he comes Smith then went out into the road and knocked him down with the stake—he took what he had and gave a cough as much as to say Come on He said he had owed him a grudge for a long time and said I don t care if I have killed him I said G—d forbid that it should be like that I said I wish I had not come now He gave me the watch and sovereign to hide up which I did and he said I will see you another day I hid the watch in the stable the same night and kept the sovereign in my pocket—Smith said I was to change it and give him half—the keys and the bag were thrown into the stream by Smith—then we came out at the gate into the Southend road and I bid him good night and Smith said be would slip home and sell his nuts to which I made no answer but bid him good night If it was not for Smith I should not have been led into it—Smith said I know it is a good watch for be has not long had it I changed the sovereign at Bromley on Monday morning—I did not see Smith afterwards till he was in custody Signed THOMAS ROSSBR COURT Q You say Smith told you he went down Lewisham to see a man named Hay ward is that in a direction towards Southend-lane A No quite a contrary way altogether—Southend is about eight miles from London just past the seventh milestone WILLIAM GLADWIN police-constable R 122 On Sunday morning the 20th of December about half-past seven o clock I went by myself to the spot where the robbery is said to have been committed—I traced the footsteps of two persons from that place across the fields into the Southend-road—the snow was on the ground very thick at that time—the marks were exactly the same over the fields as where the robbery was done and in the first field I observed that the man who had the largest feet which is Rosser had fallen down—I traced the footsteps of the two persons into the footpath leading into the Southend-road—after they got over the gate that leads into the road Smith s footmarks went towards his own house and Rosser s towards Rushey-green where Rosser lives—I know the house where he lives perfectly well—I traced his footsteps within a mile of his house and Smith s within 250 yards of his house—I afterwards took off Rosser s shoes at the station—I remarked that one of the nails stood below the rest and as I was looking at them Rosser said I nailed them on Sunday morning and put this fresh piece of leather on the heel and by putting fresh nails in I drove some of the others out —I afterwards compared those shoes with the footsteps and found they corresponded and bad it not been for the nails he had put in I am sore they would have exactly fitted—among the footmarks there was one in a furrow which was very bald at the toe—it had no nails at the toe and there were no nails in one of the heels—here are Rosser s shoes—when I took them off his feet some of the nails appeared to have been recently put on—they were quite new—there are no nails at the toe of one of the shoes but a piece of leather having been put on the heel I could not identify that—I examined Rosser s person and observed a scar on his knee as if it had been recently bruised from a fall—Rosser s shoes corresponded with the larger footsteps Smith If he is witness enough to tell one footstep from another he is witness enough to tell who cut the stake WILLIAM KIRBY police-constable R 155 I went on Sunday morning the 20th of December with Doust to the spot where he was robbed—he pointed out to me the footmarks of two persons in the lane near where the robbery was committed—behind a tree at the top of the bank I observed the footmarks of one of the two persons—I followed the footmarks across the field to the gate leading from the footpath out of the field into the Southend-road—the footmarks of one then went towards Smith s-house and the other towards Rushey-green—the gate is within two hundred and fifty yards of Smith s house—I afterwards went with Gladwin to trace the foot-marks across the fields—while in the fields we passed a hay-stack with wooden stakes round it—it is part of a fence to prevent cattle getting at the hay-stack—among them I found the stump of a stake which I have here at least the top part of it which I cut off myself—it had been recently cut—I have compared this part with the stake produced and it exactly corresponds—I followed the footmarks of Smith from the hay-stack into the road leading to the Black Horse public-house Rushey-green—I afterwards compared Smith s shoes with one of the sets of footmarks and they exactly corresponded—in the course of the next day Monday I searched Smith s house and found this piece of crape in a box in a room up stairs—the box was full of things and this laid just on the top of them—it was unlocked—I heard the Inspector request Rosser to take his shoes off and when he had taken them off the Inspector asked me whether I thought the shoes would fit the marks in the snow—I said I believed they would fit the marks had they not have been altered as there were some fresh nails in and a fresh piece put on—Rosser replied that he had put some fresh nails in and put the piece of leather on the heel on Sunday morning WILLIAM GABBITAS My father keeps a public-house at Bromley—I assist him I know Rosser by sight very well—on Monday morning the 21st of December he came to our house between seven and eight o clock—he asked if I had got a fire—I said Yes —he said he would have half a pint of gin and purl or gin hot—I made it for him—he gave me a sovereign in payment—the liquor came to 3 1/2 d —I gave him the change and after doing so I said Stone-breaking is a very good thing on a Monday morning to have a sovereign —he said he bad four to take the other week but he had been paid two and now he had been paid all up Rosser I did not tell him that I had 4l to take I said the other week I had finished stone-breaking and my lump was drawn out and I had 2l to take Witness I am sure he said he had 4l to take that he had had 2l but now he was paid all up and I said Then you will have a sovereign by Christmas-day —I have known him three or four years—I had no means of knowing his circumstances for three or four weeks previous to this—I only know he worked on the road breaking stones—I am sure he paid me a sovereign JOHN WALKER police-constable R 182 I was at the station with Doust when the prisoner Rosser called to him and said he had hid the watch in the stable at the Black Horse public-house—I went with Doust afterwards and found the watch in the stable where Rosser had stated—in bringing Rosser to Newgate afterwards he said he was sorry he had not mentioned one thing to the Magistrate—I said What is it —he said The change of the sovereign I robbed Mr Doust of is in the privy facing my house hid in a handkerchief —I went there since his committal and found 12s in a handkerchief hid in the boards JAMES BURTON I am in the employ of Mr Ledger the surveyor of the roads Rosser worked for him at stone-breaking—on the 5th of December I paid bis wife 35s and 5s to him—it was money dne to him for stone-breaking which had been lying back ever since before last harvest—on the 19th of December I paid him 6s —that was not all that was due to him because the lump was not all drawn out—Mr Ledger does not pay it till the lump is drawn out—there would be a little more due to him—he was not at work on the 19th for us—the Tuesday previous was the last time Rosser That makes my words true as I had told the publican I had 2l lying back MR JONES Q In what money did you pay the 35s to the wife A In a half-sovereign and 25s in silver and 5s I gave the prisoner—I had paid him 14s on Saturday the 12th besides Smith s Defence It is very false indeed what this man has repeated against me here he stands by the side of me and he cannot say otherwise I have had no opportunity of sending for any one or I could have witnesses enough to explain where I was that bill is not the bill the wood was cut with I will be on my oath if you look at the wood you can see that it is not neither did I cut it Rosser I am heartily sorry for what is done and had it not been for Smith I never should have been in this trouble I knew no more of what time the gardener came home than you do I knew nothing about what money he took on Saturday night nor what way be came home Smith Why did not you ask me time after time to go first house breaking with you and then one thing or another and I always denied it f—the handkerchief he has got on his neck now I believe is the one he had CHARLES ATKINS I am a constable of Lewisham I produce a certificate of Rosser s former conviction which I got from Mr Clark s office—I was present at his trial and was a witness against him in the other Court before the Common Sergeant—I am positive he is the person—I have known him from childhood SMITH— GUILTY Aged 29

see JOHN JAMES ALLEN police-constable F 159 On the night of the 15th of July I was on duty in St Giles s and saw the prisoners a few minutes before twelve o clock and another young man with them—I was then at the corner of Bainbridge-street and they were at the opposite side of High-street near Crown-street—in consequence of something I came towards Bain-bridge-street again sooner than I should have done—when I got near Laurence-street I heard the screams of a female—I went towards them into High-street and saw the two prisoners and another not in custody close on a female—Patten had his arms round her neck—he appeared to be trying to throw her down from the distance I was off I was in the middle of the road but he let go—Taylor struck her in the face and said with an oath Go on —she

close on me—they then ran away taking my watch with them—I lost a silk handkerchief from my pocket which was safe when I entered the street—I missed it directly the policeman came up to me—I have not found my watch Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Had you ever seen Kemp before A No—it was a light evening in July—I did not see him again till he was at Hatton-garden—I cannot say who struck me the blow—it was all done together—it only lasted about a minute—I was in company with Thomas Loader who was on before me—I am a cabinet-maker—I was sober—Kemp held my right arm—I am quite satisfied of Kemp—when he seized my arm a second time he turned round and faced me—I recognized him the moment I saw him and can swear positively to him Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Have you charged other

Sampson at Tothill-fields prison about five weeks ago or rather better—Elliott took me there—I had not seen him since the robbery—I had not the least doubt about him at Tothill-fields—I cannot recollect what I said there but I recollected him directly I saw him—I did not express any doubt there that I know of—I did not express a doubt about him nor had I any—Elliott did not point him out to me for when he came round Elliott was in one part of the yard and I in another COURT Q Were there other men there as well as him A Yes all the prisoners were sent out in the yard—nobody pointed him out—I knew him directly and swear to both parties THOMAS LOADER I was passing through West-street about eight o clock in the evening of the 4th of July with the prosecutor—lie was on one side of the street and I on the other I was a little in advance of him when he was hustled by several men—he was driven back to the side on which I was—I am positive he had the watch when he entered the street as I saw the seal hanging out—I did not see his watch taken from him but heard him call for assistance—being in advance of him I ran back but before I got up the party had left him and were making their escape—he directly informed me of his loss—a policeman came up at the same moment and the prosecutor informed him he had been robbed—I cannot identify the parties as they were running away when I got to him Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Which way did they run A They ran in two different directions—I believe the policeman came up at the same time as me Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Was there a woman among them A There was a woman standing at the corner of a court—I do not remember seeing a woman among them—I went to Tothill-fields with the prosecutor to see Sampson—he was brought round first with the other prisoners and was afterwards brought to the gate to us by the name of Philip Sampson—he was not pointed out to us—I cannot say whether it was then that the prosecutor recognized him—we were in the lobby or hall and the prisoners were paraded round—he was brought to the gate by himself for us to see him—I had seen him before come round with the others MR BALLANTINE Q Before he was brought to the gate had he been recognized A Not that I am aware of—I cannot recollect whether the prosecutor recognized him at the gate—I do not remember hearing him recognized ELIZA CALE I was

nearly close to them—the other two ran towards Saffron-hill—there were four in number at first—the prosecutor s friend came up to him before the watch was taken and the whole of them set on both of them—they had no power of resistance—it was a silver watch with a yellow chain—I saw it in Kemp s hand and Sampson s also—I think the prosecutor made a sort of trial to get the chain from him—there were four persons fell on him but I think there were six or seven round—I knew both the prisoners perfectly well before that by sight and name—I have seen them twelve or fourteen in a gang together—Sampson went by the name of Bill Taylor—I have heard them call him by that name—I have seen him for the last eighteen months and Kemp about the same time—I knew them directly I saw them go up to the prosecutor and thought they were going to rob him—I swear they are the men Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When did you first give an account of the transaction to any body A I told my husband of it and told the policeman—my husband is a City policeman—I was three or four yards off—I did not tell the policeman which way they went because he went after them—I saw him go up to the prosecutor—his friend went with the policeman in search of them—the policeman came to me when he had taken the prisoners and said he understood I knew about it—I did not give him an account of it till then because it is such a desperate neighbourhood I was afraid—I saw them both together once since in Farringdon-street but was afraid to give information the neighbourhood is such a desperate place—we have lived there eighteen months but at the City end of it which is not where these characters live—I never quarrelled with them—I never spoke to them—I am not mistaken in them—it lasted two or three minutes—I saw them sideways Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You knew Sampson as Taylor A Yes I had heard him called so by the people about—I was very near them—they might have seen me—Kemp ran by me with the watch in his hand—I saw Sampson a few days after in Farringdon-street but was afraid to give information—Elliott said if I did not appear here to-day he should summon me CHARLES ELLIOTT I am a policeman On Sunday the 4th of July I was on duty at the bottom of West-street—I saw a scuffle with six or eight people—I immediately ran up and saw Kemp holding the prosecutor by the right arm—there was a cry of Police —I saw Taylor and Kemp run towards Black-boy-alley—there was something yellow hanging out of the hand of Taylor alias Samson which appeared to be a watch-chain—I knew both the prisoners before—I have seen them frequently—Sampson always went by the name of Taylor before—I saw Kemp holding the prosecutor s arm and a scuffle and heard a cry of Police —I pursued them to the end of the alley but did not overtake them as the prosecutor caught hold of my arm and said he was robbed or I might have apprehended one on the spot but that stopped me—I said I Know you are robbed of a watch —I did not see Kemp again till the 17th of September when I apprehended him and took him to Rosoman-street station—I applied to the prosecutor the same evening—he knew him when he saw him—I saw Sampson about the 18th or 19th September at Tothill-fields by the name of Philip Sampson—I heard he was there and went—I knew him to be the man immediately—I took the prosecutor to see him—he was shown to the prosecutor alone in the prison dress—a turnkey stood with him but not any prisoners—he said he believed him to be the man but should not like to swear to him in the prison dress—his dress was not altered—I had no doubt of him Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was Kemp remanded for several days A Yes—I think I got Mrs Cale up on the 17th or 19th—I was witbin eight or ten yards of them when I saw Kemp holding the prosecutor s arm—I was coming up from Saffron-hill—I did not pass Cale s house —her house is in the boundary of the City—if the prosecutor had not had hold of me I think I might have caught one or both before they came to a railing in the alley—I am quite certain of them both JURY to THOMAS LOADER Q Did you notice whether the prosecutor s mouth bled A It did and was swollen

behaved very well since he was away which was for three years MR DOANE Q How long have you been a constable A About eight years CHARLES JAMES MURRAY I am high constable of Uxbridge Atkins brought the prisoner Holland to me in custody—I did not say anything to induce him to tell me anything—he said he had been drawn into it for he should not have done it if others had not persuaded him—I asked what he meant by others persuading him if there was more in it than himself—he said no there was only him and Biggs robbed Frank Woodman and he should not have done it if Biggs had not told him Frank had got the money to pay his rent with—I asked him what they had done with the 5l note—he said they persuaded him to go and change it—he said Brill bad taxed him with being concerned in it and he had given him a sovereign to say nothing about it and he thought Biggs had given him as much also Cross-examined Q How did the conversation begin with Holland A I told him Brill had stated before the Magistrate that they had done it and how they did it—he said he was a poor silly fellow and had been drawn into it that he should not have done it if the other had not persuaded him when he was not himself—I thought he meant when he was tipsy—he was quite sober when I had the conversation with him—he had been with me about half-an-hour—he drank nothing in my presence—Atkins had brought him to me

other night you can afford to lend me 10s now —he said no he could not he had not got 10s and could not lend it to me—I kept talking to him a bit and at last he said he would lend me 10s —I was not to do anything for it—I thought if I borrowed the 10s if I could get it out of him I should find the robbery out—I told him about the robbery and he told me to say nothing about it—that is what I was to do for the 10s —some days after I saw Biggs and asked him to lend me 10s —be refused at first—I told him what I knew about the transaction—he did not consent to lend me any at first but afterwards he

you let it out A No I told several farmers about it—I did not tell any Magistrate—it was not very often that I saw a policeman—I told Atkins after I was in custody CHARLES JAMES MURRAY I know the

The prisoner Holland being charged before me with robbing Francis Woodman being duly cautioned by me voluntarily states Woodman states their faces were blackened but they were not that he should not have thought of committing the robbery if Woodman had not been swaggering and showing his money that he was told Wood-man was showing his money at Hammersmith that Woodman has sworn falsely as to his purse that this man pointing to Biggs and him were the only persons who robbed Woodman that he should not have done it if not persuaded but this man persuaded him and told him Woodman had got the

and against his will 1 shilling his monies and immediately before at the time of and after the said robbery feloniously beating striking and using other personal violence to him MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution HENRY WATSON I am a hair-dresser and live in Cow-cross-street Smithfield On Monday evening the 25th of April I was at the corner of Southampton-street Strand about five or six minutes to nine o clock I had on a blouse and was dressed much the same as I am now—I was looking at some prints in a window—I saw the prisoner there—he was a stranger to me—there were several persons round the window—I was looking at a print and the prisoner observed to me that that was a well done thing—I did not make him any answer at first but after a second or two to the best of my recollection I said J thought it was—I then moved a little further to another part of the window and the prisoner came again by the side of me—he said You appear to understand these things Sir —I was still looking at the prints—I replied Not much —he then after a second or two said I beg your pardon Sir I have been out of employ some time I have a few relics at home which I wish to dispose of I do not think they are of much value I should be glad to dispose of them if I could find a purchaser —I said I am no buyer as I do not understand such things but what do they consist of —he mentioned the names of a few prints and books but I cannot recollect them—I then asked where he lived—he said Oh not above a minute or two s walk mentioning a street in the neighbourhood of Drury-lane which I do not remember—I said As I am going that way I have no objection to look at them although I may not become a purchaser —I then went with him—we crossed the road and to the best of my recollection the clock struck nine as we crossed Southampton-street—we went straight down to Stanhope-street near Clare-market and Drury-lane—the prisoner crossed the road to a chandler s-shop at the corner of Stanhope-street and there purchased a candle—I did not go in with him—he came out of the shop with a candle in his hand—it was not alight—he was about turning into as I thought a side-door of the chandler s-shop but it afterwards appears it was the next door and I said to the prisoner had he not better get a light—he said Oh no Sir never mind a light if you will allow me to lay hold of your hand I will lead you to the foot of the banisters and I will soon get a light —I went into the passage—the street-door was open—he did not get a light—he led me to the banisters—he went on first—I felt my way up by the banisters till we arrived at the third story—I then found that the prisoner had got a light—he had got up a little before me and had got a light by the time I had got up—I was on the landing—there was a box of Lucifer s on a table before the door—be was in the back-room and I stepped in after him—I noticed a print hanging on the left hand side against the wall in the room—I asked the prisoner whether that was one of the prints that he wished to dispose of—he made reply—my back was towards him—I was about to repeat the question when he said B—your eyes I have neither prints or books either what do you mean to give me — Give you I replied I have nothing to give you what do you mean and for what purpose have you brought me here —upon that he seized hold of me by my trousers outside under the flap and said I will shoot your b—head through your shoulders if you don t give me all the money you have got about you —I said I had none—he said I was a b—liar—he still held me in the same manner—for fear he should rob me I said I had only got a shilling and a few halfpence—be said Give me that —I had 25s in silver in one trousers pocket and some halfpence in the other—I took out some silver from my right hand breeches pocket and in doing so I pulled out 18 2 —upon that he said You have got more give me that give me the 18d —I gave him the shilling—I gave it him for fear he should rob me—I was then about to leave when he said Give me the 18d —I said No I will not that is all I have got —he then relinquished his hold of me and I attempted to get out of the room—he then seized hold of me again and said Now you b—I will nail you I will tear your b—linen I will tear your shirt and then I will give you in charge if you don t give me the whole pf the money you have got —I endeavoured to extricate myself from him but did not succeed in getting out of the room—the prisoner rent the flap of my trowsers down and pulled out my shirt—I was struggling with him as well as I could—to the best of my recollection I had lost all command of myself—he first rent on corner of my shirt—he could not tear it with his nails and he picked up something off the floor either a piece of china or a piece of slate or some hard substance and tore a hole in it—he did not tear a piece off—I then adjusted my things as well is I could got to the door of the room and made the best of my way down stairs—he followed me—I do not know How I got down stairs—I got out of the house—I do not think we had been out of the house a minute and a half before I saw a policeman—the prisoner reached the policeman first and was about saying something to him when I stepped across the way and gave him in charge—he was taken to Bow-street—I was examined he fore the Magistrate and he was committed for trial—ten or twelve days afterwards I was taken ill and was taken to St Bartholomew s hospital where I was confined till after the next Sessions were over Prisoner Q Did you not swear at Bow-street that you would not be answerable for anything you had done since you had been taken ill A I stated that after I came out of the hospital I could not hold myself responsible for what I did or said because I came out against the wishes of my friends and likewise of the medical advisers of the establishment—I said I would not be answerable for what I said for a certain period till I came back from the country—I was deranged—I do not know How long I was ill neither do I recollect when I came out of the hospital—you were committed before I went into the hospital—I went into the country after coming out of the hospital—I have since understood that I remained at home a week or so but I was not competent to take any part in any business—that is why I stated at Bow-street that I could not be responsible for what I did or said before I went into the country Q Was it your embarrassments of life that affected your mind or this charge have not your family been in a state of pauperism in St Sepulchre s parish and have you not been set up in business several times A Some three years ago I was attacked with fever and was then taken to the parish in which I now reside and in which I have been brought up and there I was supported by the parish authorities my affairs became embarrassed that certainly did not affect my mind—I saw some lights as we went up the stairs of the house you took me to on the first floor in particular—it was candle-light which shone under the door of the room I cannot say whether there was any light in the room on the second floor in all probability there was—I do not swear there was not—I did not see any light as I came down—I have hardly any recollection of How I did come down—had I called out I doubt very much whether any person could have heard me for your door was closed—I said at Bow-street that you took something off the ground towards the fire-place and tore my shirt with it—when you got down stairs you appeared to wish to avoid the policeman but seeing that I was determined on crossing the way you came to the policeman first—you made no charge against me—you said that we never went into any house—you did not speak to any person while you were in my company—I did not pay much attention—you might have spoken to one or two as you passed—I cannot recollect whether you did or not—I swear on my solemn oath that I gave you a shilling—what you did with it I do not know—you had plenty of opportunity of disposing of it because as I went out at the door you blew the light out—you did not object to go to the station it was no use your objecting—the Magistrate did not ask me whether I had ever been there myself in trouble on such a charge before—on my oath I never had been there on any such charge before either as the accused or as an accuser—I do not recollect the Magistrate asking me any such question—I did not produce the shirt and trousers which you tore—I have the shirt on now with the tear in it—you were committed to New gate—application was made for you to be remanded till next Session on a certificate being produced from the medical gentleman of the hospital—I was made acquainted that you were still in prison after I came out of the hospital when my mind was in a sufficient state for it—I am not aware that any application was made on my part for another remand—it could have been done—I do not know that my wife was aware of where I was—you had no pistol or any weapon in your hand when you said you would shoot my head off my shoulders but I apprehend you meant with your fist—you held me in the manner I have described—you might have struck me—you might have killed me—on being sent next day to identify the house I found it was respectable to all appearance outside—I know nothing of the inmates—I went out of the room first—the door was not locked or fastened neither did it appear to me when you went up stairs that the door was locked—any person might have had access to your room apparently SUSANNAH WATSON I am the prosecutor s wife—I remember the occasion of my husband giving the prisoner into custody—after he came home his manner was very different from what it had been before and he was taken ill on the Sunday following—I do not know the day of the month—he went into the hospital on the Sunday night—I went to see him while he was there—I do not know what ward he was in—his mind appeared to be affected while he was there—he remained in the hospital a fortnight I think—I was not with him when he came out a friend of mine was—he was not taken out he came out of his own accord—he was not in a fit state to come out—he was brought home in a cab—he remained at home a fortnight or three weeks—he was never in his right mind during that time—I have had a great deal of trouble with him the whole time—he was afterwards taken into the country for a fortnight—the trial was postponed from the May till the June Session—I appeared before the Judges at the June Session—my husband was not in a fit state to come forward then—the Court allowed the case to be postponed for one Session but my husband continuing ill they would not postpone it any longer—my husband was an out-patient for some time after he came out of the hospital—he was bled cupped and soon Prisoner Q Did you make any application at the June Session for me to be remanded and the trial put off for another Session A No I did not say anything the gentlemen only asked me what state of mind my husband was in WILLIAM HODSON In April last I was in the police force I have since quitted it—I was on duty on the 25th of April between nine and ten o clock in the evening in the neighbourhood of Stanhope-street and saw the prisoner and the prosecutor—the prosecutor was about twenty yards from the prisoner following him—they were both coming towards me—the prisoner came up to me first—he began to say something I could not understand what and the prosecutor immediately came up to me and gave him in charge—I did not take the prisoner into custody—I took them both to the station—when we got there the prosecutor repeated his charge against the prisoner and that charge was taken—the prisoner was detained in custody and the prosecutor was allowed to go at liberty—they were both quite strangers to me—on the following morning the prisoner was brought before the Magistrate—the prosecutor then appeared to substantiate his charge and after an examination the prisoner was committed for trial Prisoner Q When I passed by you did I make any charge against the prosecutor A You began to say something I could not understand what you said and the prosecutor came up—I would not take his charge then—I did not take either of you—I took you both to the station—I did not take hold of you—you did not attempt to leave me—you had no opportunity of disposing of any thing—I kept a pretty good look on you—I searched you at the station strictly—I found nothing on you of any consequence—there was a latch key—I did not find a halfpenny on you—you did not say a single word at the station except that you were innocent ANN LEWIS I am one of the nurses of St Bartholomew s Hospital—I have the care of the Extra-ward—patients of all description come there I remember the prosecutor being brought there—I have a book in which I make my entries—he came in on the 1st of May and remained an inpatient till the 12th—he then wished to be discharged and to go out—he was not in a fit state to be discharged—his mind was very much affected during the time he was there—I wished him to stay ROBERT SAMUEL ROBERTS I keep a chandler s shop in Stanhope-street Clare-market The prisoner sometimes dealt at my shop—between eight and nine o clock on the night in question he came and bought a candle—he was at that time lodging in the next house to me—I know nothing of him only as a customer—I do not know what business he is Prisoner Q Have you not known me in the neighbourhood for the last six or seven years A I do not know the exact time Q Did you ever hear a dishonest character of me A I have heard different reports—you have been in the habit of buying a candle late in the evening—I have seen you at various times WILLIAM HILL police-constable F 60 I took the prisoner into custody on Saturday night the 20th of August about eleven o clock in company with two others at a public-house in Chandos-street Strand—I and two brother-constables took the whole three Prisoner Q When you took me did I not say it must be a mistake A You did—you went quietly to the station—you did not object to go Prisoner s Defence I was taken in charge for this offence in April and committed for trial I was remanded till June the Grand Jury ignored the bill and I was discharged by proclamation I thought the case was over and never got out of the way I have always been earning an honest livelihood up to five weeks previous to being charged with this I was in the employ of the landlord of the King s Head tavern Bloomsbury who will give me a good character before that I was three years in the employ of a Mr Davies and before that I lived with Mr Shepherd in Foster-lane when I was here before I was provided with counsel and ready to defend myself now I am not and the friends who would have come forward to speak to my good character I cannot trouble again but I am sure they would speak of me as always honest and industrious I leave my case in your hands J feel certain you will return a verdict according to the evidence I am entirely innocent of the charge GUILTY Aged 25 — Transported for Fifteen Years

Churchill on the 11th of August with intent to rob him and that Stringer had been before convicted of felony MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JOHN ELLIS CHURCHILL I have an employment in the house of Messrs Ellis and Everington in St Paul s Churchyard—I am nephew to Mr Wynne Ellis the Member for Leicester—I lodge at No 44 Great Marlborough-street near Oxford-street On Thursday evening the 11th of August about five minutes before nine I went out to take a walk—I proceeded through Grosvenor-gate into Hyde-park—I am in the habit of frequently walking in the Park after coming home from business of an evening—I generally leave the City about seven o clock—on that evening it was past seven—I proceeded straight across the Park towards Kensington-gardens—after proceeding about three hundred yards into the center of the Park I found the grass damp and turned into the path which cuts obliquely from the Serpentine to Oxford-street—I turned to my right and was then in a direction towards Oxford-street about three hundred yards from the gate—the prisoner New stead then approached me from behind and touching his hat politely asked the nearest road to the City—he had on a black coat buttoned and presented a respectable appearance —he stated that he had been spending the day at Kensington and was going to some lane in the City but what lane it was I do not recollect—I told him the road that I was going was his most direct way—we walked on together as this conversation was going on about twenty or thirty yards—I then heard some one coming behind me and on looking round I saw the other prisoner Stringer coming towards me—he seized me by the collar called me a d——beast and said I had been guilty of indecently exposing my person—I raised my stick with a view to knock him down when New stead seized my arm and said You had better go quietly to the station-house —I remarked that if there were two of them it was useless my resisting—I proceeded at a prisoner with Stringer towards the gate to Oxford-street—New stead followed behind us—we went down Par Wane and down one of the streets leading into Grosvenor-square—Stringer observed that he had been watching me for the last three-quarters of an hour and added that my friend meaning New stead kept close behind me—he was behind—I requested Stringer if he felt disposed to take me to the station to go to my house that I might take some friend with me—I did not say where it was—I said it was in the neighbourhood—we then proceeded down Lower Brook-street in a contrary direction to the station I presume in order to go to my house—he asked me what security I would give him if he allowed me to go into my house—I said What security can you require if you see me to my door —when we got opposite Mivart s Hotel I saw a policeman about forty yards off—I said Here is a policeman it will soon be settled —Stringer immediately said You shall not go to your lodging you shall go to the station —I said I did not care where I went—we immediately turned back down Davis-street for the purpose as it struck me of avoiding the policeman—we went towards Berkeley-square and met a body of the police—I remarked that the police were coming towards us and Stringer immediately stopped— New stead had gone away on my remarking that I had seen the policeman at the bottom of Brook-street—I then looked behind and saw that he had gone —as the police approached us Stringer halted with me—I said Here are the police we will go towards them —we crossed the road he in the mean time seizing my collar and dragging me towards them as though I were a prisoner—he seized me by the collar at the corner of Davis-street when we first saw them—on our coming up to the police he said I give this man in charge to you for an indecent assault adding that if the sergeant went back a little way he would probably find the other fellow—we were then taming towards the station but on his saying that we went back but saw nothing of New stead—I was then conveyed to Vine-street station in custody Stringer went into the private office and made a charge against me which I did not hear—the inspector called me forward on Stringer leaving the office and read the charge to me—I was then sent down and locked up for the night—I applied for writing materials both that night and in the morning and for a messenger stating that I had money in my pocket to satisfy them but it was taken no notice of—on the following morning I was taken to Marlborough-street—my charge was the third I believe—I waited half-an-hour for Stringer to come—he made his appearance then and was examined—I was then locked up as a prisoner at the police-court—the Magistrate called on me to find bail and I remained at the office till I procured bail-one of my bail knew the firm of Shepherd and Sutton in whose employ Stringer had stated himself to be and he immediately went and brought Mr Shepherd back with him—Mr Shepherd was then confronted with Stringer before the Magistrate—I was not present but in the evening by the advice of the Magistrate s clerk I gave Stringer in charge for an assault from what had transpired on Mr Shepherd s arrival MICHAEL JOHN FITZPATRICK J attended as clerk to the Justice on the hearing of this charge and took down what Stringer said on that occasion— reads — John Ellis Churchill charged by

I lived with him as his servant he is an independent gentleman and he had no occasion for my services previous to that I was living in the service of Mr Cale a coffee-house keeper in Brewer-street I was living with him nearly two years It is false what I swore this morning that I was a porter in the employ of Shepherd and Sutton—the reason I swore so was I was out of a situation and my brother having lived in their service it came to my head to say so It is about two years since that he lived there When I swore this morning that I communicated to my employers that I had a charge at this court—that is if I did do so—it was false If I swore this morning that I had some difficulty in getting leave in coming from my employers that is false If any person has stated that I was seen in company with Edwards this morning it is false It is not true that Edwards who spoke to Mr M Arthur lodges in the same house as I do he lodges in Berwick-street I saw Edwards last night and before that about a fortnight ago I never saw Mr M Arthur before to-day I do not know Mr Ward I did not instruct Edwards to employ a solicitor I did not know he had done so nor can I account for Edwards s coming into court since the case first came on I have not seen him since Edwards is a journeyman cabinet-maker and I believe earns about 30s a-week I did not tell the inspector last night that I would be here this morning but that I must first ask my employers leave I cannot say that I see Mr Shepherd or Mr Sutton now in court I have seen Mr Shepherd about six times My stating that I was living with Messrs Shepherd and Sutton came out unawares I was not prepared for the question Q Was Mr Shepherd in court at the time he made that statement A He was—I had heard him say on the previous examination that he could with difficulty get his employer s leave but that was not taken down at the time—he did not appear when the charge was called on it was half-an-hour after its turn—I asked him what made him so late and he said that—at the second examination in the evening before he was apprized that Mr Shepherd was there I told him that he had given a great deal of trouble did he persist that he was still in the employ of Messrs Shepherd and Sutton —he said that he did—I asked him if we went there could we get one of the partners—he said it was no use because they were gone to Camberwell and the warehouse was shut up—this was in the evening just before we went in before the Magistrate MR CHURCHILL re-examined I went with Stringer to Vine-street station to make my charge of assault against him there he being in custody of a policeman—when I had made the charge and was leaving the office he turned to me in a menacing attitude and said You shall have New stead before you in the morning the man with whom you were indecently engaged in the park last night I have Been him this afternoon —that was the first time I heard the name of New stead mentioned and a friend of mine remarked at the same time that he was sure it was not a fictitious name from the singularity of it—I had not been talking to Newstead in the park a minute before Stringer came up—we bad not been in company twenty yards—there is not a word of truth in the statement which has been read—I deny the charge totally—I have stated all that passed between me and New stead Stringer Q You say you left your lodging at five minutes before nine A As near as I can tell—I do not think I was further than 300 yards in the park from Grosvenor-gate—it does not usually take me twenty minutes to walk that distance—I looked at it last Sunday on purpose and timed myself walking from the same spot to Marlborough-street and it took me a quarter of an hour—I did not say when you took hold of me Don t hold me I am a gentleman and I will give you my word as a gentleman that I will not run away from you —I did not then run away for six or seven yards and attempt to get away from you—I never offered you any money to let me go—I never said I would give you all I had about me nor offer you my stick saying it bad a gold head with my crest on it—I did not say I am going out to-morrow morning with a party of gentlemen grouse shooting do allow me to go away —and as to my cane it has not a crest on it only initials—you may have seen it was cut and supposed it was my crest in fact they are not my initials Stringer I never saw the cane not to observe it until it was shown to me by the sergeant who had him in custody next morning he then said This is no crest the Magistrate examined it also I have only to deny that this man New stead is the man that was with Mr Churchill—he was shorter and stouter than this man Mr Churchill is a gentleman of respectability and high connexions I am a poor man and with a character not the best I know at the same time that ought not to stand in the way of a man it is not because I may have committed myself once that I should lose the feelings of a man I never asked Mr Churchill for a 6d or took a 6d from him I never assaulted him in any way but taking and giving him in charge for the act which I found him at New stead I totally deny ever seeing Mr Churchill in my life he has employed a party who is paid to come and speak against me to say that he saw me on the night in question with this party at six o clock I was in the City at the time he has paid and kept him at a policeman s house he told him in the presence of the officers that he would send him to prison if he did not do that Witness I am as positive New stead is the man that came up to me in the park as that I am here MR FITZPATRICK re-examined The distance from Marlborough-street to Grosvenor-gate does not exceed a mile I go it frequently myself CHARLES WALLIS I am a dentist and live at No 44 Great Marlborough-street—Mr Churchill is a friend of mine and lodges in my house—I was at the station-house when Mr Churchill went to give his charge against Stringer—as Mr Churchill was passing the bar to come out of the room he had to pass Stringer who came forward and putting his hand oat menacingly said to him I will bring up New stead to-morrow the man with whom you were indecently engaged in the park I met him by accident this afternoon and he says he will come Stringer Q Are you positive that I said New stead or did I say M Arthur A I can positively swear that you said New stead—no other name was used Stringer I never knew this young man by the name of New stead ROBERT LISTER police-constable C 143 I was at the station-house in Vine-street when Mr Churchill went there to make his charge against Stringer—as he was passing the bar going out I heard Stringer say You shall see New stead in the morning the man you were indecently engaged with in the park —he did not say anything more that I took any notice of—I went into the inspectors room after that ELLEN THORN I am the daughter of Mrs Thorn of No 15 Denzil street Clare-market close to Stanhope-street—Stringer lodged at my mother s house and Fitzgerald the prisoner last tried in the same room with him—the other man went by the name of Fitzgerald and this prisoner by the name of Stringer—they passed as brothers but went by different names—I learnt from Fitzgerald that they were brothers—I do not think Stringer was present when he had said so—I have seen New stead go out with Stringer and frequently come to see Stringer and Fitzgerald—I saw Newstead there about a week before he was taken into custody—I never heard his name—I have often seen him and Stringer go out together—I have not the least doubt of his being the person I have seen Stringer Q How late of a night have I been out with New stead or Fitzgerald A I cannot say How late—you used to come in very late one morning you came in at one o clock and very often I have heard you come in at two—in fact you all used to come in very late indeed—there was a nephew as you called him used to lodge with you—I never saw any thing wrong about you—you used to quarrel very much and disturb us WILLIAM THORN I am last witness s brother—I remember Fitzgerald coming to lodge at the house I mean Stringer—I know Fitzgerald the last prisoner—he came with him but it was nearly a week before I saw him—they lived together in the same room as brothers—I have heard Stringer call him his brother and say he was his brother—I never heard Stringer say so in his presence Stringer Q On what occasion did you hear me call Fitzgerald my brother A When you were quarrelling—I am certain you said so FREDERICK CI ACKE I am an engineer and live in Broad-street Golden-square I know the two prisoners—I have seen them together—I saw them together on the 11th of August at Charring-cross about six o clock in the evening Stringer Q Where do you live A No 37 Broad-street—I have lived there a year—I have only been from home a short time while I was at work in Holborn and it was too far to come home to my meals—after that I went home again—I did live at No 35 Houghton-street Clare-market—I left there about twelve or fourteen months since—I bad no particular reason for leaving—I did not-break open some drawers and steal some letters and a deed concerning some houses at Brixton—I lived at No 9 Hand-court three months ago—some persons named Travers lived there—they assumed my name—we did not live there as brothers—my mother did not give me a gold watch about six weeks or two months ago nor yet a gold mourning ring—I had a watch and ring—I can hardly say whether the name of Jane or Sarah Bell or Mrs Bell was engraved inside the ring—I pledged the watch—Travers pledged it by my orders for 3l and the ring for 6s —I sold the duplicate of my watch to my landlady for 25s —I did not lend the duplicate to a gentleman named Bell next morning—there if no such person as Mrs Eden in Hand-court—I never altered a duplicate from 3s to 3l —I remember meeting you last Thursday evening—I do not remember the conversation we had—I did not away I did not expect to see you here I heard you were gone to Holland I can get you 200l what will you give me if I get you 200l Bill —I had been told you had received 200l from Mr Churchill to go out of the way not to appear on the trial which I knew to be false as I had been to Mr Churchill and told him about the prisoners and he told me if I had a chance of seeing the two prisoners in company to apprehend them—I went to see if I could find them—I saw you and asked you How you were and told you I thought you was off to Holland—that is How the 200l arose—I did not tell you I could give you 200l —I did not say so in the presence of Plume Stringer You met me again on the Friday previous to giving me into custody by St Martin s church you Plume and a young drummer you said again Are you not gone off to Holland some words ensued between you and one of the parties which ended in a quarrel Witness There was a quarrel—I said on that occasion that when I had an opportunity a chance of transporting the pair of them I would do it as far as laid in my power such horrible characters as they were—as to the person he speaks of he is the person he called his nephew New stead I deny his seeing me on the night he mentions the night before he gave me in charge I was drinking with a man named Dixon but not with Stringer THOMAS PLUME I have gone by the name of Thomas Davis to Mr Churchill—I know the two prisoners—I have often seen them together—I have known Stringer about three months and New stead about two years Stringer Q Do you remember meeting me with Clacke on Thursday evening about the bottom of Castle-street A I do not remember—I remember asking you to treat me with a pint of beer but I do not remember the evening—we went and had a pint of beer together—Clacke did not come in and look at the door to my knowledge while we were drinking the beer—I did not hear Clacke say any thing concerning your going to Holland and 200l —I have some recollection of you and Clacke and a little drummer sitting opposite St Martin s church and talking last Friday evening—I do not remember Clacke saying he would transport you and Richard Hand if he had the opportunity—I did not say so—I did not say that I never mixed myself up with other people s business and it was a cruel thing to lag another on a false charge WILLIAM SHEPHERD I carry on business in Foster-lane City in partnership with Mr Sutton as stationers—the prisoner Fitzgerald who was tried last was in my employment—he quitted it about five years since—Stringer was never in my service—he never applied to me for leave to attend at Marlborough-street or had any communication with me on the subject of this charge WILLIAM PLUME I am inspector of the C division of police I took the charge made by Stringer against Mr Churchill—after doing so I told Stringer that he must appear next day at Marlborough-street police-court—he said he would appear but he must first ask his employers leave—lie said they lived in Foster-lane in the City—he did not mention their names that I recollect Stringer Q Do you recollect saying to me after Mr Churchill was locked up that you were satisfied he was guilty of the crime from what he had said to you A Certainly not MR CLARKSON Q Is there one word of truth in that suggestion A Not one word Stringer s Defence The prisoner commenced by persisting in the statement which he had made before the Magistrate with regard to the indecent situate in which he found the prosecutor and proceeded to say I sprang on them and seized them both Mr Churchill raised his stick to strike me I put my hand up to keep the blows off at the same time the other prisoner ran away in a side direction from me I called loudly for police but no one came I seized Mr Churchill and kept him by the arm In walking across the park to Oxford-street he said I am a gentleman and I will give you my word as such that I will walk quietly by your side if you will allow me I let him go then for a few minutes and walked by his side he then attempted to run away from me half a dozen yards I overtook him and said I shall keep you in my custody and give you to the first policeman I meet he said I am a gentleman for God s sake don t expose me it will ruin me I said You should have thought of this before you committed the act and then you would not have been in my power after what I have seen I shall certainly keep you in my custody till I give you to a policeman I thought there was a station-house in Mount-street and went in that direction on inquiry I found there was no station-house there it was a work-house On going down towards Brook-street he said I am a gentleman and don t expose me I live in this neighbourhood I will give you all I possess if you will allow me to go about my business I said I want nothing from you in any shape or form you must go with me to the station he said I will give you all the money I have about me and this gold-headed stick I have promised to go with some gentlemen grouse shooting I said I can t help it as I have gone so far I shall give you into custody He said If you are determined to take me will you allow me to call at my house to take a friend with me to the station-house I said I had no objection if it was in our road and provided we did not meet a policeman before We met a body of policemen on duty I went to the first policeman and said Can you take this gentleman into custody He said I don t know that I can here is my sergeant apply to him I went to the sergeant and gave him into custody and said The other fellow is not far off he is loitering behind and at one time the other man came so near to us that Mr Churchill said Get away away I went back with the policeman to look after the other party leaving Mr Churchill in custody of a policeman in Brook-street I said to the policeman If he sees you with me he will be sure to get away so I walked three or four steps ahead of the policeman he followed me closely so that the other prisoner could have seen I was with a policeman looking after him we could not see him and came back and went to Vine-street station where I pressed the charge against Mr Churchill and he was locked up I then came back and went into the Quadrant walked up and down and met a friend of mine Edwards a cabinet-maker I told him the case he said You seem quite flurried I said Yes the thing has upset me he said Well are you going to press the charge I said Oh yes I intend pressing the charge to-morrow morning he said You had better have advice I said It is not in my power the charge is straightforward and I will answer to it I went to Marlborough-street in the morning and after Mr Churchill was committed a person came to the desk stood by listened to what was going forward and said to the clerk Is this case committed he said It is He stood for some minutes and went out the clerk said Do you know that man I said No I do not When I went out from Marlborough-street I saw this party he said Do you know me I said No He said My name it M Arthur I am sent to assist you by Edwards I am a solicitor or a solicitor s clerk I went into a public-house in Marlborough-street drank a glass of ale and M Arthur was with me a messenger came from the office and said It is necessary for you to come into court again previous to this M Arthur had been to the court and made some observation before the Magistrate when I went in the Magistrate said Have you employed a solicitor I said No he said This gentleman says he is employed by a friend of yours named Edwards I said I know a person named Edwards a young man a cabinet-maker who I mentioned this case to last night he said Are you agreeable that this gentleman shall conduct the case for you I said I have no objection but I don t see that there is any occasion for it as the party is committed I came out of the office went home and was at home about ten minutes I then went into the City while I was gone a policeman came to my lodging and inquired for me and he was told I should be at home by six o clock I came home at a quarter before six and was washing when a messenger from the office came again and said The Magistrate wants to see you again he has forgotten to ask you some questions when I got there a second time it was to ascertain whether I had lived with Messrs Shepherd and Sutton which I had not I denied that but before that I said I had at the same time I wish to impress on your minds that I gave my right name and address No 16 Denzil-street where I was found by the messenger I answered the questions the Magistrate put to me and the consequence was that while I was there the bail was accepted for Mr Churchill and immediately after I came out of the office I was given into custody for assaulting Mr Churchill in what way I have assaulted him I know not I have not abused ill-used or struck him I accused him of this act and I will accuse him of it to the day of my death I saw it with my eyes I am satisfied he is the man I will swear it before this Court and my God in any shape or form I did not assault Mr Churchill further than by taking him by the collar when I caught him in the act I have received nothing from him I have extorted nothing from him in any form I was told at Marlborough-street that I was an extortioner In what manner or shape have I extorted money Has my language been bad Certainly not I caught him in a crime that every man who is a man will revolt at which the very savages would revolt at I certainly am a poor man and my character I know is not good in consequence of once being in prison and being convicted but does that alter the feelings of a man I entreat you to weigh it well I am pressed down by a person who has talent and money to clear him and make the public mind easy but I say it again as I stand before the Court and my God the man is guilty of the crime I have accused him of Newstead s Defence You are aware that Clacke said he would transport me if he could he has told me so repeatedly I do not know for what his is the only evidence against me FREDERICK AUGUSTUS MICHELSON police-sergeant C 17 I produce a certificate of Stringer s former conviction in June 1838 which I got

the end of it—I was tripped up and thrown violently on my back—I am not certain whether the person came up to me behind or before—he was at my side when he tripped me up—he caught hold of my collar

waistcoat and with force took away my watch which was suspended by a guard from my neck—it was a silver double-cased watch—the guard was quite broken—they both immediately ran off—I cried out for a

little boy standing who saw the whole transaction—a policeman came up—I got up and went to the station with him and the boy—on the Friday following I saw the prisoner Rowan in custody—I cannot swear

Allen in front of me—my hat was over my eyes but I put it up—the watch-was gone in an instant—I do not recollect that I had seen Allen before that night—I will not swear positively that I saw him in the public-house—I do not know the sign of the house—it is in Whitechapel at the corner of a street Rowan Q When you came into the public-house with the officer he said Do you see anybody at all like him and you said No A I went into a public-house with a policeman on the Friday following—the policeman asked me if there was anybody there like the person that had robbed me—I did not say there was not—he took hold of Rowan and desired him to get up and said he was something like him—the officer did not point to him and say Don t you think he is something like him —he did not ask me if I wished to give him in charge nor did I say It is no use giving him in charge for I can t speak to him —the officer said be should take him on suspicion—before he said that I did not say whether I could or could not speak to him—I said at the Police-court I could not swear to him positively HENEY HOWARD I live at York-row Cambridge-heath On Sunday night the 4th of September about twelve o clock I was in

did not do anything when I saw this—I stopped till the gentleman got up and then went to the station with the policeman and gave a description of the men—the prisoners ran away up the court—Rowan

Whitechapel about two weeks before—he had a basket with two handles—I have seen him about Whitechapel along with some girls Rowan When he came to Lambeth-street he said they were two men with light fustian jackets on Witness I said one had a light corduroy jacket on and one had a coat—I never said they both had light jackets WILLIAM BULL police-constable H 145 On Sunday night the 4tn of September I was on duty in Whitechapel—I heard a noise went to George-yard and found the prosecutor had been knocked down and robbed of his watch—he was the worse for liquor and all over dirt and blood—he was just at the entrance when I came to him just in the street—he was standing up—I saw a boy there but did not notice it was Howard till we were on the way to the station—Howard went there with the gentleman and me and gave a description of the men Cross-examined Q Did you see the prosecutor in the public house that night about an hour before A No I saw him a little way from the public-house with two or three girls and told him to take care of him self—he said All right —I said I don t think it will be all right —he was drunk then but not so bad as he was afterwards Rowan Q Did the boy tell you it was two men in light fustian jackets A Yes one rather more dirty than the other a dirtier browner colour—the prosecutor did not tell me he had been robbed by a friend he had been drinking with he said it was a man he had been treating and he should know him well if he were to see him again—Howard said he should know the men again if he saw them—I asked him if he would call at seven o clock next night and meet me to go to Whitechapel and see if we could find the parties that robbed the gentleman—he did not come Q Did he not say last Wednesday that he never said anything about light fustian jackets at the first examination A Yes—he said he had not said both only one—he persisted in saying so after I was called in—I did not hear the Magistrate ask him what he meant by it nor hear him say he could hardly see in the dark CORNELIUS FOAY police-constable H 98 I received information on the 5th of September and on the 9th I saw the prosecutor—he had been confined to his bed till then—I went with him to the Red Lion and Spread Eagle in Whitechapel—there were about ten people in the room—I told the prosecutor to go in and look about him—there were five or six young men about the same age as the prisoners—the prosecutor pointed out Rowan and said he believed he was one but be should not like to swear to him—I took him—I saw Howard next day—he gave me a description of two people and of their dresses in consequence of which I apprehended Allen at the Founders Arms Brick-lane—when I went in he held his head down for seven or eight minutes—I took Howard next day to Lambeth street office and opened the cell—there were from ten to twelve men there—I asked him to look round and see if he knew anybody—he looked round and pointed out Allen and said That is the one that knocked the gentleman down and the other one held his hand over his mouth —I do not think Allen heard this—it was said just at the door—he might have done so—on the night of the robbery I was in White chapel from seven to half-past nine o clock and saw the prisoners go into the Red Lion and Spread Eagle—I saw them about three times in the street going in and out of that house which is about twenty yards from George-yard—I knew them Cross-examined Q When you took Allen into custody did you say any thing to him A As soon as he came out of the house I told him I took him for being concerned with Rowan in a robbery—he said be was innocent he could prove he had been in bed every night at twelve o clock for the last month Rowan Q What description did Howard give of the persons A He said one had a jacket and the other a dark coat and that one was a little taller than the other—he said at the last examination that they both had light jackets on—after Bull had been examined the Magistrate asked him if he had said that both had jackets on and he said Yes they had Rowan s Defence Last Friday week about half-past seven o clock I was in the Red Lion and Spread Eagle Foay two other officers and the prosecutor came in and looked round the officer said Stand up and we all stood up The prosecutor looked round and said No I don t see any body here and was going out Foay called him back pointed to me and said Don t you think it looks something like him he said Why I don t know I can t say he said Will you give him in charger he said I can t say it is him He said I shall take you in charge I said Very well he said he could prove where the watch was taken to and what it was sold for he took me and next morning he brought Howard to the station as soon as he saw the policeman putting the hand cuffs on me he said That is him Howard stated at first that it was two men in white jackets and afterwards he said one had a black coat on and I was the other He denied ever having said that both had white jackets on till Bull was called in and stated it and then he said he could hardly see in the dark The prosecutor told the policeman he was robbed by a friend he had been drinking with I would ask the prosecutor if he had been treating me MOSES ALLEN re-examined I am not quite positive whether I had been treating the prisoners that night—I have a slight belief about it—I had been treating somebody—I do not know the sign of the public-house—it was in Whitechapel much higher up than George-yard—I had no friends with me MR PAYNE called MARY ALLEN I am the prisoner Allen s mother On the Sunday night before he was taken he was at home and in bed at twelve o clock—he went to bed on Saturday night and was never up till eleven o clock on Monday—he was in bed all Sunday—he had only one shirt and that I was washing and mending—he had torn it in fighting—I did not wash the shirt till after six on Sunday night—another son of mine slept with him—he is at work—I cannot say at what hour he went to bed on Sunday night COURT Q What is the prisoner A He sells things in the street greens and apples and any thing of that sort—he carries a basket sometimes

t18421024-2788  2788 ROBERT FLETCHER was indicted for a robbery on John Stedman on the 14th of August putting him in fear and danger of his life and taking from his person and against his will 1 watch value 30l and 4 shillings his property and immediately before at the time of and after the said robbery beating striking and using other personal violence to him JOHN STEADMAN I lodge at the King s Head King-street Park-lane and am a servant out of place On the 14th of August at near ten o clock I was going through the Green Park towards the Duke of Wellington s—I passed three men two together and one a little a-head of them—after passing a few yards in advance of them I received a severs blow on the back of my head sufficient to throw me on the ground—I was going the nearest way to Constitution Hill in a direction from the Duke of Sutherland s—when I fell one immediately knelt on my chest and held me so tight by the throat I was nearly strangled while the other two robbed me of my watch and 5s or 6s in silver—there were three of them engaged about me—my trowsers were rent to get at the pocket where my money was—after receiving the ill usage I was left senseless on the ground till near one o clock—I suppose they all left me together—I met the prisoner about a fortnight after in the Strand—he immediately turned round and ran away from me—I knew him as I saw his features distinctly by the light of the moon while being robbed—I received the blow before I was robbed but one held me so tight by the neck I could not halloo out as I wished to do—I could well see the prisoner—he was dressed the same as when apprehended in a green coat yellow buttons and light hair rather curled—I saw him again on the 6th of October in Bond-street—the moment he saw me he made a dead stop—I looked at him—he turned round and immediately ran away into Burlington-gardens and Cork-street—he was stopped by a young gentleman who he broke from and was stopped again at the corner—I said to him You are the man who stole my watch—he said he was going to an hotel in Bond-street to take up a 10l note that was waiting for him there and he would present me with that and take me to some friends of his who had several duplicates of gold watches I had not mentioned that mine was a gold one but it was so and he had no doubt but mine was one of the number—he said they were friends of his and a person named Stringer who was already transported and Fitzgerald for assaulting a person in Hyde Park—he said if I insisted on giving him into custody I should never get my watch but if I would forgive him I should have the 10l note and eventually get my watch as the person who actually stole it was transported—that was Stringer—I got a policeman and gave him in charge Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q What are you A A servant—my last place was as footman to the Archbishop of Canterbury—I left him to get a place out of livery—I was with him twelve months but since that I lived with Lord Huntingtower—I left him as his establishment was broken up about five months ago—I have been stopping where I now am—my means of recollecting the prisoner was after I received the blow—I am supporting myself with what I saved in service—I lived some years with the late Duke of Bedford and others—Mr Trevaner was not my master—I never received a gold watch from him nor anything more than half a sovereign or so for attending to him he being lame for years before his death—I once lost a gold watch while I was attending the Archbishop of Canterbury at his carriage in the park—I gave thirty guineas for that and twenty-five for the one I have now lost—his Grace was kind enough to add part of the money as I had lost the first watch in attending him between Lambeth-palace and Buckingham-palace the night the Princess-royal was christened—I lost it while I was behind the carriage—it slipped somehow out of my waistcoat pocket—I had three hundred bills printed and advertised it—I had no guard chain I bad a black ribbon to the last watch which was broken in taking it from me—I was going home from Lambeth on the evening of the robbery—I frequently call there to see the servants—I do not frequently go through the park at night—it was my nearest way—I did not think it unsafe—I was perfectly sober—I did not see any person pass while I laid in the park—I laid just turning round the bend at the top of the park on the gravel path—the gates close at ten—I had seven or eight minutes to get out for as I passed St James s Palace the clock struck the quarter—I did not come to myself until near one—there are not policemen in the park at that hour to my knowledge—I had several minutes to look at the prisoner while he robbed me it was two or three minutes at least—I never saw him before—I cried out as soon as I came to myself—I was insensible before—I can distinctly swear to him as I was not insensible from the blow but they held me so tight they nearly strangled me that made me insensible my eyes appeared to be darting out of my head—it was not the prisoner who struck the blow nor who held me down—the path is not far from the coach-stand in Piccadilly—quite sufficient for a voice to reach—I could not cry out—when I came to myself I called Police one came and assisted me out of the park—he is not here—I do not know his name—he got over the rails at Constitution-hill and got me over—I went to the station that night and complained of being robbed—my statement was taken down by a person not here—I did not mention to the Magistrate that I had complained at the station—I did not see the prisoner again for a fortnight—I had told my landlord and landlady of the robbery they are not here—the prisoner ran away on both occasions that I met him—the policeman was present at part of the conversation—I took the prisoner from Bond-street to the public-house where I lodge—I did not see a policeman all the way—I did not seek for one—it was half-past twelve in the day—we went up Bond-street Upper and Lower Brook-street Grosvenor-square into the King s-head—I took him into the kitchen it being the only room vacant—Mrs Taylor the landlady was there cooking—I did not ask the prisoner what compensation he would give me for the property I had lost—ho said his friends were very respectable and be would not have them know it for forty guineas it would break their hearts—he burst into tears and said he knew he was in my power altogether but he hoped I should forgive him—nobody was present then—he did not say he knew nothing of the matter—we were some time in the kitchen—he was there a very short time with me alone—I called the landlord in to oak his advise—I told him I had not sufficient money to prosecute if I had the expenses to pay—he said I should have no expenses to pay—I pay 1s 4d a-day for my meals and 6d for my bed—I took the prisoner into the kitchen to remain there until a policeman came—the landlord sent for one JOHN BICKERSON police-sergeant A 22 On the 6th of October between one and two o clock I was called into the King s Head King street and received charge of the prisoner—the prosecutor said he was robbed on the evening of the 14th of August of a watch and some silver and had apprehended the prisoner in Bond-street or the neighbourhood that he had offered him 10l and to get his watch back by some duplicate found at a friend s of his named Stringer who had been transported—he appealed to the prisoner to know if he had not said so—the prisoner said Yet —I asked if he knew Stringer—he said No —I asked how he knew Stringer had the watch—he said Because I saw Stringer or a person answering his description in the park on the evening of the robbery —I then told him not to tell me any thing to criminate himself—the prosecutor gave him into custody—I searched him and found three letters on him addressed to Mr Elvin to the care of Mr Stringer No 15 Denziel-street Clare-market JURY to JOHN STEDMAN Q Where did you get over the rails with the officer A Nearly in a line with Buckingham Palace—there is a gate and he assisted me over by putting his feet on the lock of the gate—it is not in Piccadilly but Constitution-hill—it was in my way to the station where I was going—I called Police and the policeman got over there—he was on Constitution-hill—if I had called out they might have heard me at the cab-stand in Piccadilly not on Conttitution-hill—I was knocked down about midway—I was going towards the gate near Hamilton-place—I called out where I was when I recovered and the policeman came to me—there is a new road made all round there—I did not go out of my way—I do not think I could have gone a nearer way—I went in at the entrance by the Mall where the trees are—I had not passed the clock of St James s but I had distinctly heard it go the quarter—I came from the Horse Guards Witnesses for the Defence KEZIAH PITTS I am a widow and live at No 4 Queen s-court Hoiborn opposite Day and Martin s The prisoner lodged at my house for four weeks—he left me at the end of August—I recollect the 13th of August—his week was up that day and of course the day following was the 14th—on the evening of the 14th near ten o clock as near as I can recollect two gentlemen called at my house—I was just going to bed—I am sure it was not near eleven because I had just had my supper and was making the beds for my two boys and they have to get up and go to work at six—I have my supper at nine—the tall gentleman that called left the name of Butcher and said would I tell Robert as soon as he came home to come to him the first thing in the morning—the other gentleman did not leave hit name—Mr Butcher said he lived in Bartlett s-buildings I think or Bateman s-buildings I do not exactly recollect it was some buildings similar to Bartlett s or Bateman s—there is not much difference—it was Bateman s-buildings Holborn—the prisoner was not at home—he had juit gone out—he could not have been gone more than three minutes—the tall gentleman pulled out his watch—the glass fell and broke—I had no candle in my hand—I suppose he took out his watch being surprised that Robert was gone out at that time—I did not see the watch distinctly—I am sure it was a watch for the glass fell and broke—he said it was the glass of his watch COURT Q What had you been doing on the 14th of August to recollect the day A It was Sunday—I do not know what he had been doing—he had been at home all day—he had not been out before a few minutes to ten o clock—he staid at home the whole Sunday—I did not see him go out—I saw and heard him up in his room—I have not been to call on Butcher since—he is the tall gentleman—I know that because Robert said he thought the tall one was his friend Butcher—he asked if there were two—I said Yes a tall and a short one —it was the tall one asked for him to come to Bateman s-buildings and who broke the watch—there were three men and their wives and two young men lodgers—some of them were at home—they are not here—I do not know whether the prisoner can write—he lodged three months with me and left on the Friday after this—he said he had no money to pay me—I do not know Denziel-street nor a man named Stringer—no such person called there to my knowledge—I do not know Elvin or Hand nor Stado—the prisoner told me he was out of a situation all the time he was with me—I recollect this was on the 14th because his rent was up on Saturday the 13th—I told him if he did not pay me I would lock him out and he would not give me the trouble—a carpenter named Young recommended him to me—I dined at one o clock on Sunday with my two sons—the prisoner did not dine with us—I do not know where he dined nor whether he had any supper—I was not in his room but could hear him overhead—I did not go out—I think I heard him come in that night between eleven and twelve when I was in bed—I heard somebody come up and go into the room—I know it was near ten when he went out as I bad had supper—I had a clock in my room—I did not look at it—when the gentleman called he pulled out his watch and said it was just ten—I did not notice whether he returned the watch to his fob after breaking the glass—I had no light in my hand—there was a gas-light down the court and enough light for him to set the time—I could not see the watch not to recognise whether it was gold or silver but I could see it was a watch JURY Q In what month did the prisoner come to lodge with you A September it must be—he went away the latter end of August—it must be the latter and of July that he came—he never paid me any rent—I have seen victuals in his room when I went to make the bed—he was a month with mo all but a day—he kept very good hours—he was in about ten or eleven—I do not know what means he had of living JOSEPH BUTCHER I am living on my private property at Rose-cottage Alpha-road Regent s-park I have known the prisoner about four years—I knew him in a chemist and druggist s shop Mr Lenton s who at that time lived in Castle-street Leicester-square—he has left him about two years—I believe he is employed by Mr Lcnton occasionally and in September 1841 I took him into my service—I took some shooting in Essex and took him as a general servant to clean shoes and so on—he remained in my service till the end of November or beginning of December till the season was over—I came to town and had no further occasion for him—I have employed him occasionally to fetch luggage or any thing—in August last he lodged at No 4 Queen s-court in Holborn with a woman named Pitts—on the day previous to the 14th of August I bad entered into fresh apartments in the neighbourhood of Sohosquare—it was Saturday the 13th—I had called at his place but not finding him the day following which was Sunday the 14th in the evening accompanied by a friend Mr Lenton I went down again to send him for some luggage I wanted which had been left—having come to town it was left at the inn at Charing Cross—it came from Cambridge—I had come from there—I have connexions down there Q About what time did you arrive at Mrs Pitts A Why by my watch if it was correct it was within a few minutes of ten o clock at all events—mine is a gold watch with a guard—it goes accurately—I have no doubt it was the time—Mrs Pitts came to the door after my knocking several times and seeing some other persons in the house—I inquired for the prisoner—a little boy at the door first told me he had just gone out—I wished to see some other person and Mrs Pitts herself came—I asked her if Robert was within—she said he had just gone out and I must have passed him either close at hand or at the little gate going into the court—I then pulled out my watch and said It is late will you tell him if I do not see him to call at Bateman s-buildings early in the morning between eight and nine —Bateman s-buildings are in the immediate vicinity of Soho-square—I did not mention between eight and nine—in putting my watch into my pocket my thumb pressed it and I broke the glass—I made some observation to my friend about it—the glass was broken in my pocket when I got home COURT Q Had it crashed in falling into your fob A Some of it and some fell at the door—I and my friend went out of the court—I accompanied him as far as Turnstile which is a very few yards from the gate and the prisoner was crossing over by Day and Martin s blacking manufactory—I saw him from his having a cap on and his clothes—I knew him having given him the clothes—I went up to him told him I had called at his lodgings and wanted him and said I wanted him at home also and he was with me from that time to about a quarter after eleven o clock—he went home with me to Bateman s-buildings—Mr Lenton had some professional visit to make and went through Little Turnstile—I went on with Robert—I had left Mr Lenton about a minute Q Then Mr Lenton saw nothing of the prisoner A I do not know—I left him not more than a minute or so before I saw the prisoner—I think he must have seen him—I merely wished him good night and went to Robert—I was in company with the prisoner till about five minutes after eleven—he came to me again next morning—I am not graduated but am at St John s Q How long have you lived at your present residence A About two months—I took the apartments on the 13th—the landlord s name is Thompson—I took them till my place in Regent s-park was ready for my family—I am married—I had two or three large trunks and a gun-case at Charing Cross—I wanted the prisoner to fetch them to Bateman s-buildings—they were much too large to be fetched in a cab—he had a truck to get them—I think they had arrived that day by the evening coach—I had myself been stopping with a member of my family midway between Cambridge and London—the prisoner went with me to Bateman s-buildings and was there about half an hour—in fact I wanted him to go down to Westminster for a gun—I took him to Bateman s-buildings to get a letter for the gun—I did not send him that night it was too late—I had never called at Mrs Pitts before—I called at Mr Lenton s the day before—I believe he was constantly in the habit of being employed by Mr Lenton—not finding him there I went on Sunday to inquire for him at Pitts Q Could not you give him instructions without taking him to Bateman s-buildings A No he could not get the gun without giving him an order—when I got home I found it was getting late and it was not advisable to send him—he left about eleven o clock—I had the parlour kitchen and bed-room—I had a female servant there she saw him come I dare say—I rather think the woman of the house let us in—I do not know whether she let him out Q What makes you recollect that Saturday the 13th was the day you moved into Bateman s-buildings A On the previous day I had left Newport from my uncle s and my agreement with the party at Bateman s-buildings was on Saturday the 13th of August—I am positive it must have been the 14th—I came to town on the 13th by the Cambridge fly about half-past two or three o clock to the George and Blue Boar—I went from thence with a friend—I got to Bateman s-buildings about five—it is a furnished house—my servant had come by an early coach—I found her at the place—I had directed her to remain with Mrs Butcher at her sister s in Circus-road Regent s-park—after taking the lodging I took the servant with what luggage was necessary in a coach and afterwards came with Mrs Butcher and took possession—I think I had seen the prisoner about a month previous when I had been in town—he can write but not a good hand—I do not know a person named Elvin or Hand—I never heard their names nor the name of Stringer until he was apprehended and then of course almost every person heard of it—I never knew that the prisoner was acquainted with Stringer—I heard through the medium of the public papers that letters had been found on him addressed to a Mr Elvin to the care of Mr Stringer—I have no idea why I should recollect the 14th of August particularly only coupled with the fact that I went to Mrs Pitts that day—I am sure of the day from the day I entered into my apartments—I staid in the apartments about six weeks—I think I said two months just now I beg to correct myself—I know it was the the 14th of August simply from the fact of coming to town that day—I came by coach—I do not know whether my name was in the way-bill—most likely Mr Mitchell of the Red Lion did put in my name—I have occasionally seen the prisoner between November 1841 and the summer of 1842—I am on visiting terms with Mr Lenton and I have frequently seen the prisoner employed by him for various matters about the establishment in the shop and so forth—I do not think the prisoner was regularly apprenticed to Mr Lenton—I think Mr Lenton took him from kindly feelings towards his friends that he knows better than I do— I am living on my means I was educated at St John s and studied a short time for the bar but having married a wife with property and having other property I live near town—I do not follow any pursuit—in fat my health is very bad I am totally unable to do so Q How could you follow shooting and sporting A The only thing recommended to me by my medical man to prevent incipient decline—the prisoner came next day fetched the luggage and remained with me up to three or four o clock I think—I asked him why he wore that cap and told him it was a very objectionable thing to wear—he said he had no money—I gave him 4s 6d to buy a hat and paid him for his work and gave him a pair of trowsers Q What induced you to go to him at ten o clock at night about going for a gun to Westminster on Sunday and on Monday for luggage A I could not have got the gun home without a messenger—I am not accustomed to go a long distance after dinner myself and it was not a very reputable part of Westminster—my object was I would rather employ him than a strange porter JURY Q Was this your luggage from Cambridge A Yes the Cambridge coach goes to Charing-cross—it depends on what time of day you are coming—the coach I came by stopped at the George and Blue Boar COURT Q Was not you rather nearer when you passed the Blue Boar than going to Charing-cross A I did not go to Charing-cross the luggage came by another coach—I stopped midway with an uncle of mine a clergyman near Newport—the luggage had arrived before me and Mrs Butcher also—I did not arrive in town till late in the day and was then occupied in obtaining lodgings—I was accompanied to Bateman s-buildings by Mr Lenton—I called on him when I came to town—I came to Mr Lenton s from the inn—he lives in Leicester-square—and then by mere chance walking about for lodgings he said I know a very respectable erson in Bateman s-buildings if he has apartments I think they will suit you —Lenton s shop is at the comer of Leicester-square JURY Q Did that youth bring your luggage in a truck from Charing-cross to Bateman s-buildings you say it was very heavy A Yes—there is no thoroughfare in the buildings—my house was No 2 and when he rapped at the door and said the luggage was there I went out and saw him with another lad COURT Q Is your name Joseph A Yes—I never bore the name of Joseph Taddy Butcher—oh yes certainly—I scarcely ever give that name—I have no reason for not giving it—I know Willam Archibald Campbell—I am not joined with him in any charge here and never was—I was a witness for a gentleman named Rhodes who prosecuted Campbell—I gave evidence before the Grand Jury—I was not joined with him in the indictment—I am now to appear as a witness in the case next term—Mr Thomas Rhodes is the prosecutor—he was solicitor to the late Duke of Bedford—I am quite sure I am not one of the defendants in the conspiracy on the contrary was Mr Rhodes s evidence—I cannot recollect whether Campbell was charged alone I should say not—it was removed by the prosecutor—I really cannot say when—I know I gave evidence before the Grand Jury and am now about to give evidence against the gentleman who is now in the Queen s Bench Q Did you ever act as clerk to an attorney A I was during some time with Mr Rhodes preparatory to being articled to him—nobody but Campbell was included in the indictment to my recollection—he was held under recognizances to appear at Marlborough-street—be did not do so but absconded and remained abroad from about the period 1838 I believe since which time a process of outlawry has been taken out against him and by some means he is in the Queen s Bench Mr Rhodes having removed the main charge from this Court by certiorari—I was backward and forward with Rhodes a long time—Campbell was a surgeon—I ceased to act for Rhodes before 1838—I acted as his clerk three or four years that is what I mean by studying the law—I intended to go to the bar but my health was so very bad I was obliged to give it up—I have lived in London since the latter end of August or middle of September this year—I have been living in Cambridge a very long period JURY Q Perhaps you will explain why you did not have the prisoner to help you move as you wished to employ him from charity A I think I did employ him on one or two occasions but Mr Lenton had employed him more frequently than I had and I believe Lenton at that time was removing part of his stock from one shop to another—I do not know where the prisoner went to live when he left Mrs Pitts MR CHARNOCK Q Did you receive any compensation when with Mr Rhodes A No none at all my services were entirely gratuitous—I was very anxious to be articled to him—I have come out of a sick-bed within a few days JURY Q You employed the prisoner several times in the removal of your goods A No I think I did on one or two occasions CHARLES SHEPHERD LENTON I live at No 33 Leicester-square—I know the prisoner—be was in my service about fifteen months since he then left—he had been in my service about two years—I have known him ten or twelve years when he was scarcely higher than my knee—I employed him—he was connected with Cambridge people friends of mine—I employed him and another male servant at the time and he brushed the boots and things then but he was employed more with a view of learning my business but I joined a chemist in Leicester-square and had no further call for his services—since then I have employed him in collecting debts and paid him some pounds—up to within the last month I have occasionally employed him—he collected a debt in Fetter-lane a month ago and gave me the money—his conduct was strictly honest or I should not have employed him—I know Mr Butcher perfectly well—I believe he lodged in Holborn in August—I did not know the name of the person—I went there on one occasion—I was dining with Mr Butcher—he said he wanted the services of this young man the next day for some purpose to go for some boxes or something and asked me if I would walk down with him late in the evening and somewhere about ten o clock I accompanied Mr Butcher to a court in Holborn very nearly opposite Day and Martin s—I do not know the name of the place nor of the party who kept the house—he was not at home—the person in the house said there were two Robert s lodged there and wished to know which I required they said one was a groom—I said No I want Robert Fletcher —the woman said Oh he is just gone out —she is the woman who kept the house Q Was anything done about a watch was any watch produced A I do not understand what you mean—nothing occurred about a watch while we were talking that I recollect—I think there was something about the time and Butcher pulled out his watch Q Did any thing occur to the watch A It is so long since I forget—he was talking to the prisoner—I was standing on one side—I do not know whether he said he broke any thing—I cannot swear—I will tell you candidly I was walking to other parts of the court—there are six or seven houses in the court and having failed in inquiring at two or three houses being late at night we could not find the house—a little boy directed us to the wrong house—while I was inquiring there he went away and whether any thing occurred I do not know at that time—we came away together—I did not meet any body in Holborn—I parted with Mr Butcher at Turnstile and did not see any body join Butcher COURT Q Where was you going A To the neighbourhood of Bedford-street Covent-garden—I had dined with Butcher at Bateman s-buildings—I forget the number seven or eight I think—I think we dined about half-past three—we sat at table a considerable time—I do not recollect at what time I went there—I had seen Butcher after church-time in the morning—I called at his house and left for a short time to go home to my place and returned again immediately—I did not leave immediately I called there—I left some time after dinner after having a glass or two of wine Q I thought you left to go home and returned A Yes—that was after dinner—I cannot say what hour it was—I went to Bateman s-buildings again and had tea—my visits were so frequent at Butcher s I called almost every day for several years and he at my place so that I called at no particular hour—it is no uncommon circumstance even as late as twelve o clock at night—I believe I was welcome—I lived with Mr Butcher three or four years before—I do not know how long he lived at Bateman s-buildings—not very long before I dined with him—I really cannot say how often I had seen him there before that day—I might have seen him perhaps fifty times there Q At Bateman s-buildings before you dined there that is so is it A Yes—I mean fifty different days—at any rate a month—I called in in the evening sometimes Q You mean at Bateman s-buildings where you dined A Just so—I might have called there 100 times—I think he had been living at Bateman s-buildings two or three months before the 14th of August to the best of my recollection—I do not know that he lodged there as much as a month before the 14th of August—I think he might have lived there two or three months altogether—I really do not recollect perfectly three or four months makes a difference—I cannot recollect how long he had lodged there before the 14th of August—I have not the slightest idea not the most distant idea whether it was a month or more or less or whether it was three months—I really recollect nothing about it—it never entered into my mind—I mean to state I cannot recollect the time—I will undertake to say he had been there a week—I think to the best of my recollection he had been there a month—I am sure he had been there a week before—I saw him the day before Saturday —I cannot say what tune—I might have seen him in the morning and evening also—I recollect the 14th of August from the circumstance having been brought to my mind by a knowledge of this prosecution—it is merely from that circumstance that I recollect it Q State any circumstance by which you can fix this more on the 14th of August than the 7th or 21st A I can state no reason at the present moment—I only know it from what Mr Butcher stated to me—I recollect nothing of the day except his calling my attention to it asking if I recollected the circumstance of accompanying him on the 14th of August—I only recollect the date from what I understood from him from what he told me—I had no reason to make any recollection of it—it is not from my own memory but his saying You recollect going with me on the 14th of August —I do not know who got him the lodging in Bateman s-buildings—I know nothing of his connexions or acquaintances—I do not know who recommended him the lodging GUILTY Aged 19 — Transported for Fifteen Years 
t18421024-2817  2817 ALFRED LEWIS and HENRY PASSENGER were indicted for a robbery on William Bugden on the 22nd of September putting him in fear and danger of his life and taking from his person and against his will 1 purse value 1s and 7 shillings his property and immediately before at the time of and after the said robbery feloniously beating and striking him and that Lewis had been before convicted of felony MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution REV WILLIAM BUGDEN I am a Roman Catholic clergyman and live in Upper Holland-street Kensington On the 22nd of September about half past nine o clock at night I was on my way through the Park—I went in at the Hyde-park Corner gate and went down the gravel-walk by the side of the drive by the first stone bridge across the river—I mean the bridge nearer Hyde-park Corner—when I arrived there I heard a whistle and three men rushed out suddenly upon me—I know not from where but I should say they came from a plantation which was near—I had not seen them before—they came at my side and the plantation was more at my side—one of them seized hold of the front of my coat violently called me a dirty s— and said I have seen it and there goes the soldier pointing to a soldier who was on the other side of the ride proceeding along the path leading to Cumberland-gate— the other two did not lay hands on me at this moment they stationed themselves one on each side of me as a guard —he then lowered his voice and said I must have some money —he spoke quite loud enough for the other two to hear him—I said I shall not give yot any thing of that nature you shall not have anything from me —on this he thrust his hand into my left-hand trowsers pocket and took from it a brown net silk purse with steel slides and tassels containing between 7s and 8s —during the time he was doing this the other two were standing on either side of me—the prisoners are certainly those two men—up to the time when the third man put his band into my pocket I saw no one near me but the two prisoners and the soldier alluded to who might have been 600 or 700 yards off—the two prisoners both made the accusation at the same time with the other man—I was so alarmed at the time that I do not know whether I cried out but I have heard since that I did—after the first man took my purse he ran away—there is one incident which I do not think I mentioned at the police-court which I wish to mention now but I felt as if I had awoke from a dream after the occurrence the man that took my purse knocked my hat off and endeavoured to strike me with something which he had in his hand—it appeared to me to be a life-preserver—I bent down my head and escaped the blow—I am confident the pnsoners must have seen the first man take my purse and run away—on his doing so Lewis took hold of me—I cannot swear that Passenger touched me—I cannot swear whether he did or did not—he said the same as the other did—he accused me in the same manner—when Lewis took hold of me I said Why don t you leave go Leave go—I must give you in charge Q Did you say for what A For stealing my purse or for aiding the other man in stealing my purse—I charged them with aiding the other man in stealing my purse—in a short time two or three persons other man in stealing my purse—in a short time two or three persons came up—I desired them to fetch the police and shortly after Beckerson came up and I gave the two prisoners in charge—among other persons that came up I have since recognised Mr Fargues of Hull Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Was it a light or a dark night A Light it was a moonlight night—the moon was up and shining—I cannot say that Passenger did anything—he was by at the time the first man charged me and he joined likewise in saying it after the other—I did not hear any person ask him in the Queen s name to assist in taking me on the charge—I can say that no person called on him in the Queen s name—I did not hear anybody—if any person had said it I should certainly have heard it—it could not have escaped from my memory—the blow with the life-preserver did not escape my memory—it occurred to me afterwards but that was not by one of the prisoners—at that time there was no person about me but the three persons concerned in the act—I do not know any of the persons that came up afterwards—they came up in about three minutes—I understand it was in consequence of a cry which I made—I did not hear the prisoners raise any cry COURT Q You say about three minutes elapsed between the time when the first man ran away and the people coming up to your assistance A No from the time I was first attacked—not above three seconds elapsed from the third man running away and the other persons coming up—when they came up Lewis had hold of me by the throat and by the collar of my coat—I had not hold of him—they could both have run away if they had pleased—the third man when he made this charge said he had seen it and the prisoners used precisely the same words—they both said they had seen it FRANCIS FARGUES I am a commercial traveller I was in Hyde-park on the night of the 22nd of September coming from Knightsbridge and saw the prosecutor—he was about fifty yards off when I first saw him—I heard a thistle and heard a person catl out Police murder —I saw two or three persons before that but did not take particular notice of them not having my attention called—when I came up within a few yards I saw the prosecutor and the two prisoners another person was running away—I did not see anything before I saw the third man running away—I heard the cry of Murder and police before I saw the third man running away and directly after I heard the whistle—I made the best of my way to the spot and saw the prosecutor and the two prisoners Passenger at his side and Lewis in front of him with his hand up bridling him up under the chin—the third man was running away directly I heard the cry of Murder and police —when I saw Lewis with his hand on the prosecutor s coat he said We will make it all the worse for you or words to that effect—I heard the word worse —at the time he said that Passenger had hold of the prosecutor s arm at the side—I saw that distinctly—at the time I came up there were no persons with the prosecutor but the prisoners the third man had run away—the prosecutor appeared very excited and all of a tremble—he asked me to go for the police which I did but turned back fearing that he might get some harm or that the prisoners might escape while I was gone—I do not think I was away from him wore than two minutes—when I returned there was a young man there with an umbrella in his hand who is here—neither of the prisoners had hold of the prosecutor then—a policeman came up about four or five minutes after—when I came back I took hold of both the prisoners by the collar—Lewis said You had better let me go or else we will make you or words to that effect—I believe those were the words he made use of—I told him it would take a better man than him to do it—I retained possession of them both until the policeman came Cross-examined Q In whose employ are you A In Barlin Brothers tobacco and cigar manufacturers West Smithfield—this was a dark night as near as I can tell—I cannot tell whether it was rainy—I know it was rather a dark night—it was not moonlight at all events—I went up to the spot immediately on hearing the whistle and before I reached the place where they were I heard a cry of Murder and Police —a few seconds elapsed between my hearing the whistle and hearing the cry of Murder and Police —I positively swear that Passenger had hold of the prosecutor s arm—I saw him with his hands on him and they said they would make it an example to him—I cannot tell which said that—when I went away to go for the police I desired the prosecutor not told them go—there was no one there then but the prisoners—they had hold of the prosecutor—I thought he might prevent their going away—a young man named Verey I believe came up—Passenger did not say any thing when I collared him—I was not before the Magistrate MR CLARKSON Q Have you any recollection what sort of a night it was A Really I have not—I have been into the country since the transaction—I went on a journey the next morning—I saw the account is the newspapers in which the Magistrate expressed a wish that those who had seen the occurrence would come forward and when I returned to tows I sent in my name Lewis He says he had hold of me which he had not I did not have hold of the prosecutor by the collar I only had hold of him by the wrist Witness I had hold of him GEORGE VERRY I am a tailor and live at 7 Upper Rupert-street Piccadilly On the evening of the 29th of September about half-past nine o clock I was near the Serpentine river and heard the cries of Murder which induced me to leave the path—I was coming from Oxford-street and the cry was on my left—I ran in the direction of the cry and met a man running across the greep towards Oxford-street directly is the path way who I asked what was the matter—he gave me no answer but kept running on—it was a fine moonlight night—I came up to the prosecutor and found the two prisoners having hold of him—Lewis had hold of him by the upper part of his coat apparently trying to choke him and Passenger had hold of his arm but he let go his hold the moment I appeared—the prosecutor told me he had been robbed of his purse—the prisoners said they had caught him committing an unnatural offence with a soldier—I think they both spoke—I know one of them did—I cannot positively say which one it was—they said Look here this is a d—s— I found him committing s—with a soldier —those were the words Q Have you a sufficient recollection of the words to be able to say whether he said I found him or We found him A We found him —I am sure of that—it was said loud enough for the others to here—there were several persons round—every one there might have heard it I hit his hand with my umbrella and told him whatever the man had done he was to leave go of him not to choke him—he said if he did he would run away—I told him that neither party should run away neither him nor the prosecutor till a policeman came—some person went for a policeman—I should think before the policeman came that ten or twelve people came up—I did not notice Mr Fargus not to recognise him again—I noticed Jarvis—he ran for the policeman and they were given into custody Cross-examined Q What were you doing in the park at that time in the evening A I was crossing from Oxford-street to Knightsbridge—there were several people walking in that direction—they were some distance from the path—I could see several people passing each way—after the policeman came up I went on my way to Knightsbridge—I was obliged to go on my business—I did not go to the station to make this charge nor appear before the Magistrate—I was found out by seeing the account in the Times and saw there that the Magistrate regretted that no one appeared—I am a journeyman tailor in the employ of Mr Gould of Parkside Knightsbridge and have been so about twelve months off and on—I was never charged by the Mendicity Society or committed by them as a vagrant—I swear that—I was taken some years ago for selling pencils in the street being out of work—I was committed for seven days—I have never been committed since then for any thing—I was never in prison but that once—I swear that—I never went to the doors of carriages to ask for charity—I was sent to Tothill Fields prison from Marlborough-street—I do not know who by—it is four years ago—I am sure that both the prisoners had hold of the prosecutor—I am not positive whether they both spoke—there were several persons round at the time—I did not know any of them—it appeared to me that both the prisoners spoke the same words—both made the charge—I have never solicited the benevolence of anybody since four yean ago—I have not been in work ever since—I have never lived out of town—I have been out of town but not for upwards of two years MR CLARKSON Q Did you before this occurrence know any thing of the prosecutor A No nor of the prisoners—the only thing that induced me to appear as a witness was from reading in the newspaper the observation of the Magistrate—I am a single man JAMES JARVIS I am a master painter and live at 27 Great Harcourt-street Bryanstone-square I have a shop there and also one in Boulogne I was in Hyde Park on the night of the 22nd of September coming from Knightsbridge across to Cumberland Gate—I had occasion to pass the bay of the Serpentine which is in a direct line from Knightsbridge—as I was passing that part before you come across the side where the gentlemen ride on horseback I heard a loud whistle and when I got to the bay of the Serpentine I saw the prisoner Passenger running very fast towards me— I had never seen either of the prisoners before that night —I did not stop him—after he had passed me I heard Mr Bugden hallooing for help Q Look again at the prisoners and see whether you are right or wrong about the person you say was running A I am pretty near sure I am not wrong—I knew it was the tallest of the two because I saw them both together directly after—I saw the prosecutor at the end of the bay a little more than half the distance from the Serpentine to the end of the enclosure from the man I saw running—it was directly I crossed the ride that I saw Passenger running towards me—he turned the corner and went round the enclosure in a direction away from where I afterwards found the prosecutor—he went round the plantation which would bring him to the spot where the prosecutor was—that is where he returned to—it was immediately after I heard the whistle that I saw Passenger running—the moment he passed me I heard Mr Bugden cry out and I then ran towards where I heard the cry—I there found Mr Bugden and Lewis holding him by the collar of his coat—there was one more person that just came up to him before me—I am not positive who the person was but I believe it was the witness Fargus—I inquired what was the matter—Mr Bugden said he had been robbed of his purse and wanted assistance—I asked Lewis why he was holding Mr Bugden by the collar—he said that he had been seen with a soldier or some other person committing an unnatural offence and he was directed to hold him till the third person fetched a policeman that he was gone for a policeman but had never returned—Mr Bugden seemed almost out of his mind—he hardly knew what he said—he appeared very much agitated—I suppose it was ten minutes or more before a policeman came up—there were a great many people congregated before a policeman could be found—Passenger went round the plantation and came back—it was not above two minutes after I came up to Mr Bugden before he was round and back—he got back two or three minutes after I got up to Mr Bugden—he was very quickly up—he merely went round the plantation and back again—when he came back I said I think you are the one that ranaway —he said he had been for a policeman but could not see one—I told him I had just met him running away and J supposed he was the one that had been running—he came up to Lewis and Mr Bugden direct took hold of Mr Bugden s arm and told Lewis that he could not find a policeman—there were several people by at this time—I should say there most ban been five or six—he told Mr Bugden that he should not go till a police-man was found—he did not say what Mr Bugden had been doing—Lewis did Cross-examined Q How far was the man you saw running away from Mr Bugden at the time you met him A About the width of the Serpentine—he was then clear away from every body—he returned of his own accord and said he could not find a policeman ROBERT BECKERSON police-constable A 4 I took the prisoners into custody—the prosecutor pointed them out to me and gave them in charge for robbing him of a purse and 8s or 9s and also accusing him of an unnatural crime—he said three persons had done it and these two held him while the third party robbed him—I searched them at the station-house and found two keys and a knife on Passenger and 2 1/2 d and a knife on Lewis—it was a starlight night—the moon was not up Cross-examined Q Where did you take them to A To Vine-street station—I there booked the charge and next day took them before the Justice—no witness was examined there but Mr Bugden and myself—I knew nothing of Passenger Lewis Q When you came up to me had I got hold of Mr Bugden or was I standing with the other people A If I recollect right you woe in the custody of one of the witnesses Lewis I was standing with the other people and when you came up Mr Bugden pointed us out and accused us of taking away his purse you immediately took us and asked Mr Bugden whether he could get any of the other people to come to the office and state what they had seen he said he did not know but he left to go and ask them he then returned and said they would not come to the office they would not trouble their heads about it we were given into custody and that was enough Witness Three or four persons said they saw the transaction but in consequence of business they could they could not attend at the police-office—I believe Mr Bugden spoke to two or three people to come to the station where the charge was taken but in consequence of business they could not come to the station next morning COURT Q Are you positive that at the time you came up Lewis was in custody of one of the other witnesses A I am quite sure—the witness had hold of him by the back of the collar of his coat Lewis s Defence I have no character to bring I am a poor lad a boot and shoemaker by trade and was apprenticed to Mr Martin of Kingsland-road I served him four years and a half he died and I returned to my mother s I lived at my mother s at the time this happened I was coming from the Serpentine down the walk and saw a tallish man in a light coat and Mr Bugden the tall man said to me Here I hope you will stay here and mind this man while I go and get a policeman to give him into custody as I found him committing an unnatural crime with the soldier that is yonder I saw a soldier I said if it was true of course the gentleman ought to be given into custody he said If you will stay by him I will go and get a policeman I took hold of him by the arm the other man I do not know who he was ran across towards Hyde Parkcomer with the intention as far as I know of getting a policeman I still kept by Mr Bugden he pulled away to go towards the Serpentine and said Leave go of me I have done nothing leave go of me I said Sir if what the man has said is true you ought to be apprehended for it be said It is not true I said The man has gone for a police-man which he would not do if you had not committed the crime we came on to a fence where the third man first spoke to me I stood on the pathway with him he still kept pulling towards the Serpentine he said Let go I said Go which way you will I intend to go with you till the other man brings the policeman to say what he has against you but as to knowing the other man or Passenger I did not I stood by Mr Bugden and ten or eleven people came up a young man and an elderly gentleman came up and inquired what was the matter I stated the matter to them and Mr Bugden contradicted it and said the man that ran away had stolen his purse I did not believe that the people said Why do you hold the gentleman if I was him I would knock you down for it I said the man had given him in my charge and it was my duty to hold him I held him by the wrist he staid there it might be five minutes or more and a policeman came up I and Passenger were then standing in among the people neither of us were in custody of any body he told the policeman to take us into custody and he took us up to Vine-street Mary Wilson broker 33 Little

an hour and a half—I mean to swear I drank nothing there—I was talking to some friends in the parlour—I cannot say what they had—they might have had beer gin rum or brandy—I did not drink with any of them because I had no money to pay my share—none of them offered me any thing to drink—I had money in my pocket but it was to pay what I owed—I spent money at the Queen s Head—I had 10s 6d when I went there which I owed for lodging and sixpence I changed at the bar—I went from my own house to Cadogan-place—I probably had a glass of ale at dinner—I generally have half-a-pint of porter—I had no wine or spirits that day—while I was talking to the policeman the male prisoner came up and said What is the matter —my companion came with the policeman directly—the prisoner was prevented from getting away with the others because he saw the policeman come up close on his legs—he would have made his escape with his companions had the policeman not been so close at his heels—he saw the policeman had his eye on him—he was at the corner of a court—I do not know the name of it—directly he saw the policeman come up he said Well I think you have been very badly used —I said You are the villain who first struck me —he asked what was the matter or some such kind of word—he could not escape he saw there was no opportunity because the female witness had her eye on him as well as myself—he saw he was discovered—I first spoke about having lost halfpence yesterday in the Court not before—I was asked by the clerk at Marlborough-street and I said I had some halfpence but would say nothing about that because I could not swear they were taken from me—I cannot swear they were taken from me at that time Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q The female prisoner had hold of you by your hair and dragged you along did she A Yes for about three yards—the four men assisted her—they prevented my calling out because one of the men who escaped had me by the throat—there was only me and Watson walking together—there was nothing to prevent their seizing the girl too—they thought I was a respectable person and seized hold of me—we were walking arm-in-arm—I was knocked down ten or eleven yards from the court to the best of my judgment—I should say within a dozen yards—it is a narrow street—I was knocked down immediately they came up Q Did not you see them laughing before they came up to you A They were talking together—I cannot say as to laughing—I saw them very well Q Were not two or three of them dancing about on the pavement rather wildly and ridiculously A No—the Deptford Theatre has been closed some time but it has been opened very recently within a day or two—I performed there last at Christmas 1841—I have performed at many theatres since that at Maidstone Manchester Doncaster and others—my money was in my breast-pocket—I mentioned what I had in my pocket yesterday and it was put into the indictment—Watson did not cry out—she went for a policeman MARY ANN WATSON I am single and live at No 3 Hand s-place Granby-street Waterloo-road On the 16th of Dec Mr Phillips who was a stranger to me was going home and I was walking with him through Bear-street Leicester-square which leads to Castle-street—the male prisoner was walking along behind us very quickly—he came along the front suddenly turned round and knocked Mr Phillips down—the female prisoner was in his company—after he knocked Mr Phillips down four men came across the way from the corner of Castle-street and came round Mr Phillips—the female pulled him by the hair of his head—I was frightened and went at once for a policeman—I could not see what the other men did—I found policeman C 59—the four men who surrounded him went along Bear-street as quick as they could towards Leicester-square—as soon as they saw the policeman the prisoners went across the road to the corner of St Martin s-court and stood there—when the policeman came up the male prisoner came across the road and I said That is the man that knocked Mr Phillips down —he is the person I am certain—the policeman took him—I did not hear him make any observation to the constable—the woman was not taken till the next morning at the office Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did she get away A Yes—she was standing at the corner of the court with the man and got away—the prosecutor was knocked down at the corner of Bear-street—the men were not laughing at the time they laughed when they went away Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q You are on the town are not you A Yes—the male prisoner was walking with the female—he walked behind us very quickly then came in front—at that time the four men were standing at the corner of Bear-street—they were not with the prisoner when Phillips was first touched by the prisoner they came up afterwards—I was talk-ing to Phillips at the time—I was on the outside not nearest the wall—I did not expect he was going to be knocked down—the four men came round him as soon as he was knocked down and I immediately went for a policeman—I was with the policeman when the male prisoner came over—the policeman was then helping Mr Phillips up—I did not take particular notice of the countenances of the four men—we were not walking quickly—the prisoner was walking quick as if to pass us—up to that moment I had no occasion to notice his features—I knew him again—the female took hold of Mr Phillips s hair after he was down not while he was falling—she dragged him along the pavement about a yard—it was not so much as half a dozen yards—I did not see that the male prisoner helped her to drag him—the four men were round him—Mr Phillips did not say anything to me at that moment about having lost anything—I heard the policeman ask him if he had lost anything—he said the key was out of his pocket—I cannot say whether he said it dropped out—the key was the only thing I heard mentioned but he was walking with the policeman and the prisoner—I was a good distance behind and another policeman said I must go to the station with them MR CLARKSON Q Had you or Phillips said anything to the four men or to the prisoners before he was knocked down A No JOSEPH BARBER I am a policeman About three o clock in the morning I was passing along Bear-street Leicester-square and saw three or four men coming in a direction from Castle-street they were laughing—at that time I was not aware that anything had happened to anybody—I came to the corner of Castle-street and saw the young woman—in consequence of what she said I went up to Mr Phillips who was about a yard distant from the woman and saw Bayley standing at the corner of St Martin s-court—the prosecutor said he had been knocked down and attempted to be robbed—Bayley came up to the prosecutor and asked him what he said—the prosecutor said that was the man who knocked him down and he gave him into custody—Watson said That is the man who knocked him down and pointed to the woman who stood at the left-hand corner of the court and said That is the woman who caught him by the hair of his head —I did not take the woman because she was not given into custody at the time Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Have you told us all that passed between the male prisoner and the man A Yes—I was three or four yards from the men I saw laughing—it was not two minutes after I saw them that I saw the prosecutor Celia Cooper wife of William Cooper boot and shoemaker No 7 King-street Golden-square and Mary White widow of No 1 King s Head-court Great Sunderland-street gave Somerville a good character BAYLEY*— GUILTY Aged 25

and after the said robbery feloniously cutting and wounding him on his head —2nd COUNT for beating striking and using other personal violence to him at the time of said robbery MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution JOHN PREBBLE I am a purchaser of miscellaneous property and live close by St Mark s-place Kennington On Saturday the 11th of Feb I was out between one and two in the morning—I had not been drinking very much—I was in the neighbourhood of Westminster and entered the King s Head public-house in Orchard-street—I was alone at first but was afterwards in company with Eliza Spillard—I am not aware whether she went in with me—she might have followed me into the house—I do not recollect being in her company only from her statement—I saw all the four prisoners at that public-house and they asked me to treat them—I think it was Bassett first asked me—I treated them after much solicitation—they said Will you not pay even for a pint of beer —I said I do not mind a pot as you have been out of work many weeks—I am sorry to see you so distressed —I threw down some money—I do not know whether it was sixpence or a shilling and they had some beer—the weather was exceedingly bad that night—I waited at the King s Head probably three quarters of an hour during which time I sat down I am told in the tap-room—I do not know whether it was the parlour or tap-room—I recollect sitting down—I remember leaving the house by myself—after I left the house I was molested by four or five persons two men and two or three women and it is very probable that Spillard may have been among them—I was laid hold of on each side of the arm by some man on each side and I was pushed down Union-court and into No 9 I believe it is—I made some great resistance—the door was open and I was forced in—there was no light in the passage—after I was forced in I was laid hold of by the clothes and dragged or rather forced up stairs into the front room first floor—the first person I had any communication with was Mary Bassett—they were all of a gang together at the time I was forced up stairs—it was in the dark and I could not observe Bassett then but she afterwards brought a candle and I think offered me some liquor—I forget whether I partook of it I am not certain—I perfectly recollect Bassett—I identified her in the morning—I remained there perhaps till eleven or twelve o clock in the day I cannot say the exact time—I found I was in a very low bad place—I said to Bassett Let me out of this house what shall I give you —I gave her some silver something of little consequence for her to let me out of the house which she said she would do—I heard a noise below—she said it was lodgers quarrelling—I heard some screaming—she had previously prevailed on me as much as possible to lie on a bedstead which I refused to do—she went down stairs saying I will go and see all clear —she returned almost immediately and closed the door after her—I heard somebody outside walking up stairs at a very quick step and Fitzgerald rushed into the room and said What does this man want here —you have done me an injury —I said For what reason —he asserted something similar to certify that I had been connected with his wife—he said to Baesett Has he got any money —she told him it was in my pocket—he then laid his hand on me—I said I can give but I will not be robbed —I dashed myself from him and a struggle ensued—I told him I could not fight much but I would try what I could do—I was making a rush at him but I was struck violently on the head with some instrument—I cannot swear that he struck me—I was so close within his grasp and it was done so suddenly that I was thunderstruck almost stunned—another scuffle ensued to get me out at the door—there were two other men at least at the door—they tried to get me out at the door and I was pitched on my head down stairs which caused concussion of the brain and great bleeding happened afterwards—the cut is not closed yet—the bone of the head was fractured by some instrument—a jerk of the neck caused the vessels to break and I lost a great deal of blood—I bled the greater part of the morning on the stairs—I recollect M Grath hitting me several times down stairs as well as up stairs—he is the man that stood at the door—I am not positive whether it was M Grath or Fitsgerald struck me with some instrument—M Grath was standing at the bed-room door—the door had then been opened with the intention of getting me out or throwing me down stairs—Fitzgerald is the man who fought me first and took my purse—my clothes were taken afterwards—I no doubt had my clothes on when I went into the room I did not go to bed at all—after losing a great quantity of blood I recovered from the sort of faintness in which I had been from the stunning blow I had received and found I was lying on a flight of steps very wet and dirty—I raised myself step by step till I came to the first floor door I tapped at it but could get no answer—I said if they would fetch a doctor I would forgive them—however I received no answer—I pushed the door went in and asked them for God s sake to let me only sit or lie down and I laid till it was near day-light—Fitzgerald then got out of the bed—he was lying with a woman and on the other side was a woman who is now in the hospital who had the typhus fever—a more horrid sight could not be—the woman he was in bed with is not here—after I was robbed he weet out of the house and returned with some woman and on that bedstead I asked to lie down till it was light—when I recovered myself on the stairs on getting up I found my boots were gone also my stock great coat and hat—I had my trowsers and waistcoat on—I had no under coat—I had but one coat on and that was taken—it was a tight coat—about 1l 16s in silver was also taken a purse keys some little odds and ends and a silk pocket handkerchief which was afterwards found—Fitzgerald got up between the lights after he had been passing the greater part of the night with this woman—he said to me two or three times over You b - - why don t you get up —I said Let me lay I don t do you any harm and I said to the woman What is he getting up for —the woman said He is only getting up to go to his work at Pimlico he works at Pimlico basin —she got up herself about five minutes after he got up Q Did you see any more of M Grath in the room A He made a most fiendish countenance at me in the outset—I was hit several times on the stair-case—they were in and out all night but I cannot recollect who the parties were—at last they all left the room except the poor woman ill in bed—some woman came into the room and I said Here is a woman dying for God s sake go to the hospital and get her in —Bassett was in the room the first part of the night—she did not sleep in the room—I did not see her—I do not think she did—there could have been no place for her to sleep unless it was on the floor—Bassett was in the room at the time I was beaten and received the blow on my head—she stood back behind the door—Fitzgerald came in as she stood and she said Here he comes —she knew that he was coming no doubt—Iam sure she was in the room when I received the blow—I saw a light-haired woman I cannot positively swear it was Nolan—I cannot say whether that light-haired woman was in the room at the time I received the blow—she may have slipped out—I was too much agitated in a scene of that kind to pay particular attention—I remained in the house I think it must have been till eleven or twelve o clock—several persons came in in the course of the morning—Bassett sat at the fire with a child on her knee with a diseased head—I asked if I could get my great-coat—a dark woman who is not in custody told me if I said a word they could prove I had broken into the house—after several people coming in from curiosity to see if I was still there and still alive a little boy peeped in—I asked him to fetch me a cab which he did immediately—I was covered all over with blood—I had then ventured down stairs seeing that the house was deserted—everybody had gone out of it—when the cab came I walked into the street across the yard throught the wet in my stockings and shirt sleeves—the cabman came round to me and gave me a piece of carpet or a horse-cloth to put under my feet but I put it over my shoulders and head—I was extremely cold and in a sort of treme—he drove me home—for two days I was extremely delirious and foolish—I do not believe I was in my proper senses—I went to Mr Barker a surgeon to have my head examined—I could feel that I had a serious wound on my head—I was under medical treatment about three weeks—I was confined to my bed nearly seven weeks—I did not find my handkerchief myself—I have been asked since if a handkerchief corresponded with mine and I have five or six like it—I compared it with them—I cannot say it is mine except by comparison and the pattern—there may be many thousands of the same—it has no mark Bassett I never saw the gentleman in my life till next morning he never gave me any money I came down next morning with a baby hearing a bother in the house and said You look very bad are you the man that fell down the stairs —he said Yes but I was very tipsy I asked him if I should wash his head Witness She had a child on her knee at the fire but she never spoke one word to me and she very shortly retired—I have no recollection of her offering to wash my head—I do not think she did but I would not swear it Bassett Q Did I ill-treat you or take anything belonging to you A You instructed Fitzgerald to take the money from my pocket and said Take it all and he took it all M Grath Q Can you swear positively that I struck you with some weapon outside the door A I do not swear that you did but one or the other did Fitzgerald Q What time did the boy peep into the room as you say A I cannot say the hour—I think he was the last one that came in to look just to see if I was there—I have seen him since—he said he lived in the house—it was about half-past eleven o clock when the cabman took me away—the boy was not gone for him five minutes and he took me away directly—I think there were not more than two men shoved me up stairs—there was atleast two or three women—there were other men in the house—somebody pushed me behind—whether they were men or women I cannot tell—I presume it was four or five o clock when you got up—it was nearly getting daylight—the woman you slept with was a young woman—I have seen her since at Queen-square—she got up about five minutes after you Bassett That woman was in bed with a bricklayer man ELIZA SPILLARD I am a girl of the town I live at No 18 New Tothill-street Westminster On the night between Friday the 10th and Saturday the 11th of Feb last I met the prosecutor opposite the Horse Guards about ten o clock—I never knew him before—I went with him up the Strand to an oyster shop and then to the Pine Apple in Hungerford-market—we had drink there—we afterwards went to the King s Head in Orchard-street—we got there about half-past one or it might be twenty minutes to two in the morning—I saw the two female prisoners there—I did not see the men—I knew the females by sight by seeing them about Westminster—they were there when I went in with Mr Prebble and they joined us—they asked Mr Prebble to treat them—he said they were a different party he did not know them—Bassett said if he did not treat them they would muzzle him and his Moll too and with many words he treated them—when he had treated me with glass of something to drink he came out of the Ring s Head to the bottom of the steps—Bassett and Nolan followed him out and asked him if he wanted a room—the gentleman said he would have no objection to going and staying an hour or two with me if I would like to come and they came down Union-court—that is right opposite Tothill-street—the gentleman and me and the two women turned down Union-court one on each side of us—the gentleman was tipsy—I went to turn round to go back again as the gentleman refused going into the house and saw the two male prisoners behind following us down—that was the first time I recollect seeing them that night—I did not see them in the public-house—when I turned round the two men dragged the gentleman into the house and the two girls dragged me in—Nolan shut and fastened the door—the two men then went up stairs and Bassett took the gentleman and helped him up stairs—the two men went up stairs before the gentleman—the gentleman did not appear to be willing to go up stairs—he called out to bring up the young person that was with him to bring up his lady—Nolan held me in the passage and told me the room was not convenient for me to go into it—Bassett came down stairs again in about three minutes with a wine glass of something for me to drink—I was still in the passage—she told me to drink that or else I should be sick—I refused it once but she put it to my mouth and I drank it—Nolan was in the passage by the side of me holding me up by one arm—I had been drinking a little but was not tipsy—I drank it because they told me to drink it or else I should be sick—I was frightened—about two minutes after I had drunk it I found myself quite insensible and very sleepy—I was not able to support myself—Bassett and Nolan then began to take my clothes off—they untied my cloak first—I was in a helpless state—I was standing with my back against the wall in the passage—no one had hold of me after they gave me the drink—I remained on my feet all the time but felt very sleepy—Bassett took my cloak off—they took all my clothes from me except my shift—in the morning I found myself lying in the passage in a great pool of water very wet and only my shift on—my gown was by my side—I had on my shoes and stockings when I went into the house—also a petticoat bonnet and cloak—Bassett said when she took them off You little cow you don t keep these fine clothes —it was about half-past seven when I awoke—I was very stiff from the bruises and the ill usage that I had had—I did not hear any disturbance up stairs—I was overpowered by what I had taken Bassett I never saw the woman Nolan Q Did not you go out of the King s Head with the prisoner Fitzgerald and go down the court A No—I went out with Mr Prebble—the bonnet that I lost was a cotton velvet one—I never said it was a silk velvet M Grath Q Did you ever see me have a hand in taking your clothes or anything A I am quite sure it was you I saw go up stairs—you had on a round jacket—I did not notice what sort M Grath I wore a coat that night—she is mistaken—she has taken me for another man Fitzgerald Q Did you see me at the King s Head A I did not—I only saw you at the bottom of Union-court when I was turning back come up the Court—I will swear positively that you are the person—you had on a round fustian jacket and a black cap—I knew you very well MR CARKSON Q How long have you known Fitzgerald by sight A Ever since I have been in London which is four months last Friday—I have been in the habit of seeing him down in Tothill-street and in the neighbourhood of Westminster—I had seen M Grath before that night about Westminster—I did not know him so well as Fitzgerald COURT Q Did you know Fitzgerald to speak to him A Yes I have spoken to him before WILLIAM WEEKS I am landlord of the King s Head Orchard-street Westminster My house is open late every night except Saturday—I know Fitzgerald quite well and M Grath—I saw them at my house on Friday night the 10th of Feb between one and two o clock with several other men and women all in company together—I recollect seeing Bassett that night—I cannot recollect Nolan—she might have been there but I am not able to swear to her—I have not been subpœnaed or bound over but have come to state what I know COURT Q About what time of night did you see Bassett there A They were there the most part of the night till I should say about two o clock but I cannot swear positively to the exact time Bassett Q Did you see me accost any one to ask for anything to drink A I do not remember your asking to be treated but I recollect Mr Prebble treating you with some gin and water—I did not see you with Spillard that I recollect—I do not remember Spillard being there—I heard that she was but I do not remember seeing her myself M Grath Q Did you see me in Mr Prebble s company A I did not but you wanted to take two glasses of gin and water into the tap-room with you and I would not allow you to do so unless you brought the money first as is our usual custom—I afterwards took the gin and water to Mr Prebble in the tap-room and he paid me for it—I cannot say whether you wore a cont that night M Grath I was drinking there with my sister and she sent me for the glasses—did not my sister pay for two glasses of gin and water at the bar Witness I do not know his sister—she might have come there but I did not know her to be his sister Fitzgerald Q How was I dressed A To the best of my belief you had a fustian jacket on—whether you had a hat or cap I cannot recollect—I have known you ever since I have been in the house which is two years next June—you were there about one or two o clock—you were there before Mr Prebble came in—I cannot say exactly how long—it might be an hour or so—you were out and in during the time you were there—you did not stops in all the time—I cannot remember when you went away for the last time—it must have been later than between one and two or about that time—I believe you came and fetched two glasses of gin and water to take in to Mr Prebble—I did not see you take them to him but he was the only party drinking gin and water in the tap-room—I did not see where you took it to—Mr Prebble was in the tap-room in company with two other men—I thought they were his friends—I went in to advise him to come out and those parties told me they would take care and see that he was all right—they were strangers to me—you paid for the two glasses of gin and water before you took them away SAMUEL WELLINGTON I am supported by the parishioners of St Margaret s in the workhouse On the night of the 10th of Feb I was living at No 10 Union-court Orchard-street—Bassett and Nolan lived there at that time—I slept in the second floor back-room—early on the Saturday morning I heard a noise in the house—I was in bed at the time—I had known Bassett for about three weeks and was able to distinguish her voice—she came down to us in the room and told us they had a swell and another young woman in the house and asked George if he would come up-stairs—two other boys named George and Robert Cuttle were in the room—George is about sixteen years old—he put on his clothes and went up-stairs—there is another floor above us—she did not say in what part of the honse the parties were—I know M Grath—he had been in the house that night very late after I had been in bed but before I heard Bassett s voice he came to the room where I was in bed and asked George what business he had with the gentleman s coat and he took it away from him—that was after the noise and after Bassett had been to my room—George went up-stairs when Bassett called him and when he came down he had a coat a pair of boots and a hat—he brought them into the room where I and the other boys were sleeping—it was after that that M Grath came into the room and asked George what business he had with the gentleman s coat—George did not make any answer and M Grath took the coat from him and took it away—about ten minutes afterwards he came in for the boots and said the house was going to be searched—I cannot tell the time at all accurately—I saw Nolan in the room that night—I do not know the hour—she brought in a mantle a bonnet and a boa laid them on our bed and said George will you let these be here till the morning —George afterwards took those things away in the morning and took them up to her—she used to sleep up-stairs Bassett He says he slept in the second floor and we were above him there is not a house in the court more than two-story high Witness I am quite sure there is a story above the room I slept in—I used to go and fetch her water for her—there are rooms above the second floor—you go up thirteen steps from the floor I sleep on—I did not hear her ill-use the gentleman Nolan When he first came to the station-house he said I was not the person that I was a stouter person Witness I did not say that—I was asked whether she came down and told George to come up-stairs and I said it was not her that came and told George—no more it was M Grath Q Did you see me go up stairs and bring or take anything away A I do not say you went up stairs it was you that came and took the coat and boots—I had never seen you before—I do not know what dress you had on—I saw you with the gentleman s coat on—you put it on in the passage—it was the coat you came and took from George MR CLARKSON Q You say that you slept in the second floor how do you count the floors A The bottom of the house is one floor and where we live is the second floor—I heard the gentleman halloo out in the night for somebody to come and put a blanket under his head and he would forgive them and nobody came—I afterwards saw the gentleman in the morning in the next room to ours—he was in the room sitting by the fire with his head all covered with blood and the sleeve of his shirt was bloody—he had no coat hat handkerchief or boots on—I went and got him a cab—the cabman put something round him and something under his feet too Bassett Q Was I not there when you went for the cab A No I did not see you there then DANIEL LLOYD In Feb last I was lodging at No 11 Union-court Orchard-street There is no number on the door—it is right opposite No 10—they are two end houses—I know the two female prisoners—Bassett lived it No 10—I do not know where Nolan lived—on Saturday morning the 11th of Feb between one and two o clock I was going home and saw the four prisoners and Mr Prebble in Union-court—they had hold of him—they were all four together at that time—Bassett had hold of his arm—Fitzerald was close to him—I cannot say whether he had hold of him—they were taking him down the court—he appeared a little tipsy but not much as appeared to me—I went home and went to bed—after I had been in bed a little while I heard a row in the passage opposite a scrambling and jumping about—about seven o clock next morning I saw a boy named Robert Cuttle—he came out of the house with a hat in his hand—he had a cap on his head—in consequence of something I thought I went over to the house and up stairs into the first floor front room—I there found the gentleman lying on the bed with his head cut dreadfully and all over blood—he appeared very faint indeed and his hair was all matted together—that prevented my seeing the sort of wound he had—I looked about to see for his clothes but could not find any—he had no boots or coat or hat—he had a waistcoat—Bassett came in and she said it was a shame the gentleman should be used so and then went away—I remember seeing Jane Ingram there—she said to the boy George Cuttle if they did not give the gentleman s clothes up she would tell the policeman—Bassett was then standing on the stairs with a basin of hot water in her hand—she was near enough to hear what was said—she ran after Ingram and said if she did not mind her own business and go out of her room she would chuck the basin of water over her—Ingram then ran into her own room which was the front parlour of the house I lived in—Bassett and Conway or Nolan followed her—Nolan was standing by the front parlour window and threatening—she was not in the room where the gentleman was—Nolan is known by the name of Conway—I did not know her by that name—I have seen her about going on for two years at different places but I never knew her name before—after that Wellington went for a cab Bassett This man and Ingram live together she prostitutes her body to support him he lives at No 9 Witness I live at No 11—I live in the same house with Ingram but not in the same room—she does not support me by her prostitution Nolan He has not been long out of twelve months imprisonment Witness I have been in prison for thieving some sponges and had twelve months imprisonment—I have been out nearly nine months—I have never been in prison except that time M Grath He has had two months for thieving a coat since then Witness I have not not for anything of the sort—I have not been confined at all since I came out Fitzgerald Q In what part of the court was I when you saw me alongside of the gentleman A In the turning of the court—there are two courts it goes down to the bottom and then turns another way and it was just by that turning—Spiller was a little way behind JANE INGRAM I lived opposite No 10 Union-court Westminster I was standing at the door late on Saturday night the 11th of Feb between one and two o clock—I saw Bassett and Nolan take Eliza Spillard into the house No 10 and after that they took a gentleman in—they took the girl in first—the two male prisoners followed in after the gentleman and the two women—the gentleman resisted going in and came out again—he was dragged in afterwards—M Grath and Fitzgerald were close behind him at that time persuading the girls to get him in as soon as they could—I heard them tell the girls to take the gentleman up stairs and they would be up after him—I remained at my door and in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I heard the cry of Help and Murder and a great scuffling and noise in the house—about five minntes after the row I saw the two male prisoners come out of the house—M Grath had a bundle under his arm which appeared to me to be like a coat— he had nothing under his arm when he went in —M Grath came out first and Fitzgerald followed out after very quickly directly—they both went the same way together—they left the door open—I knew Fitzgerald before by sight—I had seen him about twice before at the King s Head in Orchard-street—about a quarter of an hour or twenty I minutes after they went away I went and showed the gentleman a light—he asked me for some water—I had none to give him—he was on the first floor landing—his head was bleeding—I looked at his head—he was wounded very much—I afterwards heard something in Bassett s room which was the second floor front room at the top of the house—I know the room where Wellington used to sleep—it is the first floor back room—while I was in the house Bassett called out for me to go and mind my own business or they would serve me the same—I did not see Spillard after she went into the house—I did not go to the end of the passage—I was afraid to stay and went home—between seven and eight in the morning I went over again and saw the gentleman in bed in the first floor front room—he appeared to be very weak and ill from the loss of blood—he was under the bed-clothes—I saw a little boy with a hat—I told him to give the gentleman back his hat—Bassett ran down stairs after me with a basin of hot water—I was frightened of her went down stairs and went to my own room—she came over and used very threatening language—she said if I said anything at all about it she would be the death of me—I afterwards saw the gentleman taken away in a cab with a horse-cloth on Basset Q Do you live at No 9 or No 11 A No 9 right opposite No 10 M Grath Q Did you see me shove the gentleman into the passage A No but I saw you following close afterwards—I cannot say how you were dressed but I think you had the same jacket you have on now Fitzgerald Q How far was I from the gentleman A A very few paces—it might have been half a yard—I am sure the girl went in first—I staid with the gentleman a very few minutes because of Bassett—you had on a cap and jacket—I cannot say what coloured one it was a dark night—the gentleman was on the first floor landing not in the room JAMES BRADLEY police-constable B 134 I took Bassett into custody on the 18th of Feb in her own room at No 10 Union-court Orchard-street Westminster—I told her I wanted her for ill-using Eliza Spillard and a gentleman in her house on the 10th—she said she knew nothing of it she was innocent—I was at the station on the 25th of Feb when Nolan was brought there in custody—she was wearing this bonnet which I produce—I told her I thought she had got the prosecutrix s bonnet on—I did not know Spiller s name at that time—she said she had had it about six weeks and she had bought it—on my way with her to the Magistrate she said she wished she had had nothing to do with the clothes or the bonnet—I was at the Kensington police court on the 3rd of March and received charge of M Grath there—I said I wanted him for robbing a gentleman and a young girl in Union-court—he said he had nothing to do with it be knew nothing of it—the little boy Wellington was brought in by Inspector Taylor while I was sitting by M Grath—I had not said anything to M Grath about Wellington or any one else being a witness against him but when he was brought in he said There is a pretty boy to come to give evidence against a man—to swear against a man —I said How do you know he is come to swear against you —he said Because I know he is —on the 19th of Feb I examined Bassett s room after she was in custody and found this hatchet there—it was the only weapon I could find in the room Bassett He never asked me a question when he came into my room he was not dressed as a policeman I asked his business he gave me no answer but began to search the place Lloyd rushed into my room and swore to a young woman who was there he said me and that young woman were the two that came to beat his old woman this policeman did not tell me what he came for Witness I told her when I first went what I took her for there were two women in the room the other one was let go Lloyd was not in the room at the time he came and gave me the information before I went into the room he told me on the landing that both of the women were in that room and that both lived in that room when I got them both out he said that one of them was not right but having them both in custody it was my duty to take them to the station M Grath I did not say that the boy was a pretty witness till the old gentleman Webster I believe his name is the crier that attends the Court said This is the lad that will do for you my boy Witness He said nothing of the sort JAMES SKELTON police-constable B 94 My duty is in the neighbourhood of Westminster and has been so nearly nine years—I have known the prisoner Fitzgerald ever since I have been in the police—I have known him in the habit of frequenting the neighbourhood of Westminster and of using the King s Head—I was in search of him for this charge about a fortnight after it happened—I apprehended him on Wednesday afternoon last—I was not able to find him before—I had been in search of him—I found him in the back-kitchen of his mother s house in Causton-street Westminster near the Penitentiary—I told him the nature of the charge—on the way to the station he said You need not want so many policemen to follow me—an innocent man never resists —I thought it prudent to take six other policemen with me ELIZA SPILLARD re-examined This is my bonnet I am sure of it it is the one I had on on the morning of the 11th of February and which was taken from me—the fellow bonnet is here Bassett s Defence On the 11th of February I was going down the court and heard there was a young woman at No 7 who had been robbed of a mantle cloak boa and bonnet the young woman in the parlour told me she had lain there all night and that two men had done it she was robbed at No 7 The prisoners know I never saw the woman in my life till I was taken into custody On the 18th of February two policemen came into my room they never said what they came about but began to search my room I did not know they were policemen Jane Ingram and Lloyd swore to me and Mary Cain a young woman who was washing in my room and said we were the two women that beat the young woman she directly contradicted him and told the policeman that belongs to the Westminster division that she had only been out of prison on the Tuesday he said he did not think she had been out long when they took us to the station Lloyd went over to the fireplace to Ingram and said Swear to the tail one I asked what they had to swear to me for they made no answer Bradley Mary Cain and the young man went away all together The inspector asked me if I knew what I was taken for he dare say I did—I said I did not he said For robbing that young woman I said Where was she robbed he said In your place —I said I knew nothing of it I heard of John Fitz robbing a young woman at No 7 Union-court but I knew nothing of it I never saw the young woman till I was taken into custody Nolan knows I was not there when she was robbed Nolan s Defence I was not there John Fitz is the man that did the robbery he and her went down the court together About half an hour afterwards I was going down the court and met Fitz with the bonnet mantle and boa M Grath s Defence I know nothing of the charge and don t know either of the prisoners now at the bar I never saw them before When the boy was brought to Queen-square the man there said laughing at me Here is a boy that will do for you I never made any remark that I know of I might but I don t recollect it One says I had the coat on my baok another says in a bundle one swears I forced the man into the passage another says I did not do it Fitzgerald s Defence Mr Prebble states that when he first entered the public-house in Orchard-street he saw me M Grath the two female prisoners and Spillard there all together that he entered the public-house by himself I hope you will bear that in mind and that we applied to him for something to drink saying we were poor and out of work and that he gave us 6d or 1s to get a pot of beer with that he stopped there about three quarters of an hour and went out and as he went out he was accosted by three women and three men me the prisoners another woman and another man He says that Spillard was one of the women that they enticed him down the court and we followed him that he did not like to go into the house and that Bassett laid hold of the collar of his coat and dragged him in that M Grath and another man shoved him up the stairs into the first floor he states that he was in the dark till Bassett fetched a light to him and he said I will give you some money to let me go out The next witness Spillard swears that she met him at the Horse Guards at ten o clock in the evening it was at one o clock he says that he came to the public-house in Orchard-street by himself she says she accompanied him to an oyster room in the Strand then to the Pine Apple in Hungerford-market and then to the King s Head in Orchard-street they called for something to drink there she states that the two female prisoners induced him to treat them which he did but as for me and M Grath she says she never saw us there she never saw us till she was at the bottom of the court when she was about to turn back again from the door of No 10 she says she met us there just by the door and we would not let her go away she then said the female prisoners came and forced her into the passage and the gentleman was in the passage all the while that we went up stairs before the gentleman and Bassett helped the gentleman up stairs while Nolan held her in the passage by the arm with the door shut The third witness the gentleman that had the twelve months imprisonment then states that he was coming home at half-past one and saw the two female prisoners take the gentleman down the court and then come out and take the female in and then heard us say Make haste and take him up stairs and we will be up directly I hope you will bear in mind that there are three different statements the boy states nothing at all concerning me he never saw me and Jane Ingram states that she saw me and M Grath come out of the house one after the other the gentleman states that he was in the first floor and two other witnesses state he was in the second pair when the prosecutor was so much in liquor when he came out of the public-house why did he go down this court why not refuse at first He was intoxicated when he came out of the public-house and after he got down to the bottom of the court as he states he was sober I do not think a man can be sober when he is out drinking all the evening from nine or ten till two o clock in the morning Is it likely if I had committed a robbery in the house that I should stop and sleep there JANE BENNETT The witness Spillard came up to my place at half-past seven o clock in the morning—she had on all her under petticoats and her gown—she had no ring except a common ring and beads she had none only a penny glass necklace and a pair of ear-rings the value of 1d —they sell them in the Broadway Westminster Any article on this board for a penny —she came with all on as she went out in the evening except her bonnet boa border and mantilla BASSETT — GUILTY Aged 33 M GRATH — GUILTY Aged 19

before at the time of and after the said robbery beating striking and using other personal violence to him MR WILKINS conducted the Prosecution GEORGE FREDERICK WOOD I live in Circus-road St John s-wood On Friday night the 2nd of June I was returning home from Bow—I got to Whitechapel-road at near twelve o clock within ten minutes of twelve—I had drank something but was sober—when I came into Whitechapel-road I met two females and a man walking together—I asked them where there was a cab-stand—the two females caught hold of my arm and said they would show me where there was a stand—I cannot recognize either of the female prisoners as the persons—I walked some little distance to discover a stand and felt them pulling me by the arms—I was afterwards knocked down and rendered senseless in a certain measure—I was so stunned I had no power left and was robbed—I had when I left Bow five 10l and one 5l notes and five sovereigns—the notes were pinned into my right waistcoat pocket—I am quite positive the notes and money were in my pocket when I left Bow and after that I was not in contact with any person or in any situation in which that money could be taken out—it was inside and my coat was buttoned—I felt a person s hand in that waistcoat pocket twice distinctly and at the same time I felt a tugging—that is the first thing I remember after I was knocked down while I was on the ground I had not strength to resist—the next thing I recollect was the policeman coming up—I was lifted off the ground—my hat was gone—I remember feeling it taken off after the money was taken—I did not see who did it—I was quite stunned from the blow and paralysed in a measure—I lost all my strength—I was knocked down not more than two or three minutes after seeing the females in my estimation—I had a pocketbook and handkerchief in my hind coat pocket—they were also taken Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You are a gentleman of property are you A Yes I receive an allowance from my brother—I had been to visit a person at Bow—I walked as there was no omnibus—I had left home in the morning with my money—I had received it the day before—I was going to pay it away—the greater part of it was due to a person in Gray s-inn—if I had gone to town earlier I might have paid it away—I received it at a banker s—I have not seen any of the notes since—I will not say I might not ask somebody for a cab-stand previous to meeting the females but I avoided coming in contact with anybody recollecting I had the money—I asked the question of a man about a quarter of an hour before I met them— I did not walk with him—he was going in an opposite direction—I believe nobody else came to me but will not swear it—I will swear I entered into no conversation with any one—I felt the hand put into my pocket while on the ground and tried to keep hold of it but I had not strength Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Did you come into Whitechapel-road by the fields or along the high road A Along the road—I am not in business—I have funded property of my own—I do not keep money at a banker—I had come through Mile-end gate—my friend at Bow did not know I had this money COURT Q Who is the banker where you received it A Gosling s—I had it on the 1st of June MR WILKINS Q What is your brother A An officer in the army—I received 65l MARGARET WHITE I live in Wentworth-street and am on the town On Friday night the 2nd of June I was at the Pavilion theatre in Whitechapel-road with Garland—we came out at twelve o clock—I saw the prisoner Martin go up to a man and call him as he was standing at the door of the Gardener s public-house—she said to him Come along make haste here is a chance or some such words—he followed her—in about five minutes I saw Mr Wood and the two female prisoners with him one having hold of each arm—I knew Martin before—I am certain of her—Hill had on a lilac-coloured frock a dark shawl and a blue velvet bonnet with red ribbons—I saw a bonnet in the hands of Alderman the constable before the Magistrate—it was such a bonnet as she had on—I pointed Bannister out the morning after the robbery to the constable as the person who had been with Mr Wood—she was dressed the same as the prisoner Hill Q When the two girls took hold of Mr Wood what did they do A They walked with him a little distance—they stood opposite the Earl of Effingham public-house—there were five men behind Mr Wood—I saw those five men search his coat-pockets—I thought I saw them draw something out of his coat-pocket but cannot say whether it was his coat they lifted up or a handkerchief—the two females then let go of his arm and the two men took his arms—I saw one man put his hand down his coat—the prisoner Stacey I am quite sure is the man who did that—I did not know him before—I saw him walking with the gentleman—I saw him put his hand down inside his coat which was not buttoned—there was several more men behind—there was a crowd assembled—I was standing at a distance and saw Mr Wood knocked down—the two women were in the crowd all this time—I know the prisoner Brown he was in the crowd—I saw him speak to the men who ran away two or three times—he did not appear to be doing any thing but looking about—he looked from one man to another and then spoke to them again—I saw him first in the crowd before Mr Wood was knocked down—after he was knocked down the men ran down Black Lion-yard—Brown remained on the spot for some minutes—I saw Martin go off directly after the men left with a hat in her hand—five or six of them went together—Stacey ran away with the others—I fetched a constable—when I returned with him I think I saw Brown there but will not be sure—I noticed Mr Wood when he was walking between the females and thought he was rather intoxicated—he appeared quite senseless when he got up Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Did you know the two girls before A I had seen one of them once or twice before—I positively swear it was Martin who called the man from the public-house—the people were coming out of the theatre at the time—there was not a crowd at the public-house door—I cannot say whether the hat was snatched out of Martin s hand—the girls were walking with him when the men searched his pockets—whether they saw what the men were doing I cannot say their heads were turned away—he was knocked down about five minutes after they let go of him—I do not know how he was knocked down his head was by the doorway and six or eight men about him at the time Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Bannister on Monday wore the bonnet and shawl Hill wore that night A Yes I am positive of the bonnet and shawl—I had not seen Hill before ELIZA GARLAND I live in Wentworth-street I went with White on the 2nd of June to the Pavilion—I know Martin—when we came out I saw Martin run to a young man who stood at the Gardeners public-house and say Here come here is a chance or some such words—he followed her shortly after—I then saw five young men behind Mr Wood feeling the outside of his pockets with their hands—there were two women one on each side Mr Wood—I know them both by sight—I know Martin was one—I cannot say whether Hill was the other—she was the same height as Hill—I know Brown—he was among the men in the crowd talking to the young man who was on the right-hand side of Mr Wood—as soon as the women left Mr Wood two young men took his arms—Brown was at that time alongside those men—on the right-hand side—they walked Mr Wood a little further then he seemed as if he was knocked down—he was laid on the ground—the men immediately ran up Black Lion-yard—a few minutes after Martin ran up the same turning with a hat in her hand—Brown staid a few minutes and then walked away—I was two or three yards before Mr Wood when he was knocked down—I was behind him at first—I turned round on hearing the men run and saw Mr Wood on the ground—I did not see him knocked down—I believe Stacey is the man who was on his right hand—I saw that man put his hand down the right-hand of Mr Wood s coat Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You saw him knocked down A No—I saw him standing there then saw him down—they all scampered off immediately—there were a great many people in the road coming out of the theatre—he was knocked down about a hundred yards from the theatre—there were thirty or forty people about MR WILKINS Q How many were there about the prosecutor A Seven or eight—a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes elapsed from my first seeing him till he was knocked down MR WOOD re-examined I received my cheque from Mr Marris a solicitor and got it cashed at Gosling s EDWARD PAYNE I am clerk to Messrs Gosling On the 1st of June I paid a cheque of 64l drawn by Hicks and Marris in the name of G F Wood with five 10l notes one 5l note and 10l in money—I have a memorandum of it which I took from my book—I recollect it without reference to the paper ANN BANNISTER I live in Plummer s-row Whitechapel On Saturday morning the 3rd of June I saw Mary Ann Martin with the prisoner Hill and went with them into Osborne-street—while 1 was walking with them Hill asked if I would exchange bonnets with her—she said she wanted to go to see the prisoner Charlotte Martin that she was frightened that the two girls that were witnesses against Charlotte Martin would know her again up at Lambeth-street if she went there—I lent her my bonnet—she gave me hers in exchange and we exchanged shawls—she did not say where she had been the night before or explain what she meant by their knowing her—I went down to the police-court with Hill s bonnet and shawl and was taken into custody EDWARD SIMMONDS I am a policeman On Friday night the 2nd of June I was on duty in Whiteechapel-road from a quarter to twenty minutes to twelve o clock—White and Garland gave me information in consequence of which I went to Trumpet-court Whitechapel-road and found Mr Wood there—a constable had raised him up—I thought him a great deal the worse for liquor—White and Garland described the dress of one of the girls and from that information I apprehended Martin in Montague-street—there were ten or twelve people with her men and women—they were going from Wentworth-street towards the Pavilion—I stopped Martin and told her I took her on suspicion of running away with a gentleman s hat and robbing him in Whitechapel-road—she said she had not been in Whitechapel-road since ten o clock when she was at the Dolphin drinking with others—she began to cry—I took her to White and Garland—they said she was the woman who ran away with the hat—I had seen Mr Wood in Whitechapel-road before this walking with two females one on each side but did not notice who they were—this was eight or nine minutes before I went to him and a quarter of an hour before I apprehended Martin MARY ANN MARTIN I live in North-street Trafalgar-place Whitechapel and am the sister of Charlotte Martin On Saturday the 3rd of June I received information respecting my sister in consequence of which I went to the station in Denmark-street and found her there—in consequence of what Hill told me I went in search of Matthias and found him going out of Wentworth-street about nine o clock in the morning—I asked him what I was to do concerning my sister being taken up for this robbery—he said he did not know—I said it was a very great robbery and my sister was to suffer for it—he laid it was only 4l 1s —he said he had had 1l for his regulars—I said that was nothing to do with me he was to come and get my sister off—he said he did not mind being half-a-sovereign towards getting a counsellor—I said I did not want any half-sovereign I only wanted to get my sister off—he told me to meet him at eleven o clock at the Archers in Osborne-street and he would bring the other men with him and see what could be done for her—I went there at eleven o clock but did not find him—I knew he lived at Allen s in Baker s-row—I went there and noticed a lot of things in a band-box all packed up ready to be carried away—there was a new bonnet and gown among them—I came out with him to find the other men—a cab passed us with his young woman and another man in it and the boxes—it was not either of the prisoners—the young woman said to Matthias Harry Harry jump up behind —I said I can see what you are doing you want to go away without finding any body and leave me in the lurch —Mary Ann Hill was with me at the time—she said it was a great shame he should go away and leave my sister in the lurch to suffer—I gave him into custody then—Hill had come to my house at two o olock in the morning and had been with me all day—she was with me when he said there was only 4l —the prisoner Stacey is called Carroty Fred—I heard Hill say he was where the robbery was done overnight—Matthias said he would go and look after Carroty Fred and Andrew Murphy and bring them to me—he said he had been over the water in a cab looking for him but could not find him—Hill did not say where Matthias had got any money from Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q He said there was four of them in it A Three men—he only mentioned the names of two persons besides himself—he said my sister had not had any of the money—I did not go to ask him for money Q He proposed to you to subscribe out of his own money to get her a counsel A Yes—I told him I would have him apprehended and I did—I had left my sister about half-past nine o clock at night—she has been on the town about six months and was never in custody Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q You are an unfortunate girl A Yes—I was never tried in a court of justice or ever imprisoned Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q How soon was Matthias taken up A About two or three o clock—Hill went with me to the station and gave information which led to his being taken MR WILKINS Q Did Hill give information to the police A No she went with me to the station—she came to me at half-past two o clock in the morning and said she was coming by when my sister was taken—she thought it was for robbery but she did not know MANSEL EVANS I live in Bell-court Princes-street Whitechapel and am a harness-maker Up to Friday night the 2nd of June Matthias lodged in the same house as me—I have the ground floor—he lodged up stairs—I and my wife went to bed between nine and ten o clock that night and between twelve and one I was aroused by Mary Ann Hill—she asked for a bit of candle—we knew her voice and paid no attention to her—she mentioned Carry Smith who was an acquaintance of hers—my wife then got up and gave her a bit of candle—while she was waiting for the candle she said to my wife We have done it for 50l and I am waiting for my regulars —she said she had the gentleman in the road he was looking for a cab—she then went up stairs into Matthias s room with the candle—I could hear men and women up in the room—I could hear their voices but not to understand what they said—in a short time I heard a footstep come into the court and a man s voice halloo out either Nammas or Lammas —I had heard that expression before and believe it is a phrase among thieves to run away—the people in the room above then ran down stairs—Hill went with them and every body in the room except Amy Pool who cohabits with Matthias—in about a quarter of an hour Hill returned and went up stairs—she and Pool came down with a lighted candle left it in my room and said they were going away not to return that night—next morning Hill came in with three or four women between ten and eleven o clock—Hill said it was very hard that as she had put the men on the block they should offer her 10s but she was sorry after that she did not take the 10s —she afterwards said she would have them all transported unless she had her share—they had some gin and then went away—Mary Ann Martin came into my house in the afternoon and saw Matthias in my pretence—I heard her say to him it was very hard her sister should be locked up she had not a friend in the world she would be starved and not have a counsel to plead for her unless she had assistance—Matthias said he had not 1s —she said if he had not he knew where to get it—Matthias went up stairs—they did not follow him—then Mary Ann Martin and Hill went out together—I heard Hill say the girl that was taken up was taken for her because they exchanged bonnets and shawls Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Matthias was not present when Hill mentioned about the 50l &c A No he was up stairs—there was nobody but me and my wife in the room—Martin s sister said it was hard her sister should be transported for nothing Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q You did not see Mary Ann Hill A Yes she came into the room—I heard all I have stated—I did not exactly pay attention to every word—I will not swear that Matthias did not say anything to Mary Ann Martin about the 10s —I thought it was a robbery but I like to look to my own affairs—I have never been taken up for robbery but for a spree getting tipsy—that was once or it may be twice—I worked at harness-trade last Wednesday for a doctor at Hackney—I was never in prison in my life—not in the House of Correction or any gaol—I must confess 1 was in the House of Correction but not for robbery—it was for an illicit still MARIA EVANS I am the wife of Mansel Evans On Friday night the 2nd of June about twelve o clock Hill came and knocked at our door when we were in bed—she said she wanted a piece of candle for a young woman named Carry—I got her a piece—she said she had put them on to a bloak for 50l —she went up into Matthias room with the candle—I heard several persons there besides her—I heard men s voices but did not hear anything they said there—after Hill had been up stairs a little time a man came down came to the door and said Namraas —then they all came down stairs and went away—Hill afterwards returned and Amy Poole who lived with Matthias—Hill said she would have her regulars to-morrow—they went away—I fastened the door and went to bed—Hill came to my house next morning and said they had offered her 10s for her regulars but she would not take it—I saw her again in the afternoon with Mary Ann Martin and Caroline Smith—they saw Matthias in the entry—I heard Hill tell Matthias she would have her regulars—he said he could not give it her for he knew nothing about it nor had he any money about him—he then said Come along with me I will see if I can get it and they all went away together—I saw no more of them WILLIAM ALDERMAN police-constable H 7 I was before the Magistrate when Mary Ann Hill was put into custody—she had been examined as a witness—as I put her into the dock she said something to me—I do not think the Magistrate could hear her—I did not state it to the Magistrate but did to the clerk afterwards in my deposition and it was read over in her presence—I afterwards went to her lodging and found this bonnet there—I have not the shawl ANN BANNISTER re-examined This is

Whitechapel-church and was going round home the back way we met a good many chaps coming out of the Bell I and Mary Ann Hill was telling the chaps about the gentleman being knocked down and the policeman came and took me that is all I saw Harry Matthias take the money out of Carrotty Fred s hand and put it in his mouth he said to somebody there they are all counters sovereigns The prisoner

across the road towards the station that is all I saw I went home with Bateman WILLIAM ALDERMAN re-examined I heard Hill s examination read to her—I do not know why she did not sign it Brown s Defence I had been to the Pavilion with Bateman and in returning saw the gentleman in a leaning position against the shutter supported by the officer I heard the tall policeman ask if he had lost any thing he said yes his hat he appeared to be drunk he said he had lost other things and called again for his bat which was the time the witnesses saw me as they state another policeman came up and took him across the road after that I saw both the female witnesses they both knew me personally before this living in the same neighbourhood I and Bateman walked down Whitechapel towards Osborne-street I shook hands with Garland after this took place and bid her good night I went home they might have taken me into custody for I did not go away I was not there when the gentleman was robbed but I believe the witnesses having seen me afterwards think I was there at the time it is not likely if I was concerned I would have allowed the others to divide the money and not be myself provided with counsel Stacey s Defence I was not in Whitechapel after eleven o clock I was at home by half-past eleven JOHN BATEMAN On Friday evening I went to the Pavilion with Brown we came out and went towards Whitechapel church the first thing that caused us to stop was seeing a gentleman in custody of two policemen he said he had lost 43l and his hat he wanted a cab to go home they said No you had better

live at No 10 Summers-yard Coburg-road Westminster I was going home about half-past twelve o clock on Saturday night the 3rd of June and met the prisoners Miller and Layton who asked me to treat them with a drop of gin—I said I was not proud I would treat them or any other woman—I was then in Strutton-ground about two minutes walk from Union-court—I ted to pass Union-court —there is a public-house at the corner and I was going there—when I got to the corner I asked them to go into the public-house—Miller said they could get the gin at their crib—I went with them to their crib which was down Union-court No 13 into the back parlour—I was perfectly sober at the time—I had ten half-crowns and a sixpence in my pocket at the time and 1s which I gave Miller for the gin—she did not say where she was going for the gin—I cannot accurately state how many doors off the public-howe No 13 is—she was decidedly not gone out of the room long enough to have gone to that public-house—Layton remained in the room with me—when Miller came back she brought about half-a-quartern of gin in a tumbler—she had also a small spirit glass—she poured some gin into the spirit glass and handed it to me—I drank it—I have drank gin before—that quantity of gin would not have any effect on me if unadulterated—it was the half of half-a-quartern—I felt a drowsiness come over me directly—I then took my money out of my waistcoat-pocket and put it into my left-hand trowsers -pocket—Miller and Layton seized me directly—I have no recollection further than that I kept my hand secure in my pocket where my money was and found it cut—I noticed it was cut before I became quite insensible—I do not know who did it or how it was done—I saw no more persons in the room before I became insensible—I do not know of their doing anything to get my hand out of my pocket—nothing more occurred to my hand that I recollect—I became insensible soon after—I cannot tell whether I was beat or not—I afterwards recovered my senses partially—I had gone into the house with my hat on—when I became sensible I could not see my hat and I afterwards found my money was gone—on becoming sensible I told them they had robbed me of my money and taken my hat if they would give me my hat I would forgive them for the robbery of the money if they would let me go—Miller and Layton were present then—I did not see any other persons—nothing was then done to me that I recollect—I was not in a condition to know whether there was any other persons in the room or not at that time—to my knowledge I do not know that anybody else was pretent—I had not lost my money before I became insensible—I do not recollect whether I was beaten or not—I was at the hospital when I again became insensible—I do not recollect being put out

black—the left-hand which I had endeavoured to protect my pocket with was cut in three places—it was at the hospital that I found my money was gone—I did not know it before—I knew my money was gone when I told them they had robbed me—my senses were knocked out of me again after that—I knew that my money was gone before I became insensible the second time—I ascertained it by feeling in my pocket—I recollect feeling in my pocket between the two attacks on me—I became insensible once and then again and between the two times I ascertained that my money was gone COURT Q Then did you lose your senses a second time A Yes—before I lost my senses a second time I received a blow on my head—Miller and Layton were all that I can remember being present—I do not know what I was struck with—I

about three when the robbery was done—they did not pay for beer or spirits for me—I did not tell them I had no more money or say anything about pawning my boots nor that I attended fairs and races—I did not offer to-play them if they had three thimbles—I never said a word about it—Shehan laid some thimbles on the table—I did not offer to play with them for anything—there were eight or nine persons in the house all strangers to me WILLIAM ROGERS I keep the Horse and Groom John-street Edgeware-road In consequence of what was said I went to the tap-room—I saw the prosecutor—I saw three thimbles on the table and the prisoners and two or three strangers sitting near them—I said if they did not put their thimbles up immediately I would send for a policeman and give them in charge—they took them up I cannot say which of them and I returned to the bar—in a few moments I heard a great noise and there was a fight among them—I went in and Edwards was crying Murder —he was holding Grady with one hand and his other hand was extended as if holding Lawley—as I went into the tap-room I saw Shehan going out at the bar door into the street—Lawley struck at the prosecutor—I got before him

the prosecutor pulled off one of his boots threw it on the table and said if they could get an old pair of shoes he would put them on and pawn his boots that they cost 10s —Grady went out and brought in an old pair of shoes—Summers tried them on and said they would not fit and said I am too wide awake for you lads as I have been an old lagger which means I believe a returned transport I knew that at the time he said so —he said I get my living by attending fairs and races I carry the tables with the thimbles and work them —he said if there was any person in the room who would get him three thimbles he would bet a pot of beer no man would find the pea— some time previous to that he said he had no money about him —Shehan went out and brought in three thimbles and the prosecutor said he would bet any man in the room no man could find the pea after he had worked the thimble—Lawley said if any one would back him for 6d or a pot of beer he would find the pea—a man in the room said he

walking-stick 6d 1 penny 2 halfpence and 1 farthing his property MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM WHITE I live in New-walk Whitefriars and am clerk to Mr Peter a barrister On the evening of the 29th of Oct about eight or nine o clock I was passing through Hyde-park and saw the prisoner between Cumberland-gate and the Serpentine—I was going towards the Green-park—the prisoner was in his regimentals—he spoke to me and said It is a cold night —we walked together side by side—he asked me if I was going out at one of the upper gates—I told him I was going out at Grosvenor-gate and he then laid his hands on * * * outside my trowsers—that was very soon after I told him I was going out at Grosvenor-gate I cannot tell how long—he then said You had better come this way it will be nearer to Grosvenor-gate —we then got under the barriers to go the nearer way—I turned from the way I was going to go the way he suggested—that was after he had done what I have described—the barrier is a railing which separates the path from the grass—we were nearly by the Serpentine then—when we had got under the barrier and got on to the grass he snatched my stick from my hand and collared me—this is the stick I had—he then said You b—b— you shall not go till I have had something from you —I told him I had nothing to give him—he said he would search me—he still kept hold of my coat and collared me tight and he searched my pockets—he took out of my outer coat pocket a red silk pockethandkerchief and from my waistcoat pocket a penny two halfpence a farthing and a gold enamelled shirt-stud—he said I had a watch—I told him I had none—he then said I had money in my hat—I took it off and showed him that I had none—he had still got me by the collar—he then said I should not go until he had had my outer coat off my back—I told him he should not have it—he again said he would have it—I wrestled and got from him and called for the police—I ran away from him—after I called Police he ran after me with the stick—he did not reach me—I called Police a second time and he then ran away—I heard the policeman spring his rattle and call out Follow him —I did follow him and the policeman followed me—I followed the prisoner some distance—I cannot say how far—he was running towards Bayswater—when I had followed him some distance I saw another policeman coming in a cross direction and he caught the prisoner—after he was caught I saw the other policeman Kemball pick up the stick which the prisoner had dropped—I did not see him drop it—he picked up the same stick the prisoner had taken from me and I saw him pick up a silk handkerchief—it is not mine it is my master s—I had taken some things to be cleaned in the handkerchief in the course of the day—the prisoner was taken to the station with the handkerchief—I know this halfpenny looking at one by its battered appearance—it is one of the halfpence the prisoner took from my waistcoat pocket Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Is your master here A Yes—he did not know I had the handkerchief—he had told me to take the things to my mother s—I took them in the morning—I returned to the Temple but took the

were you going A Into Regent-street to see a friend in John-street Golden-square—I entered the park at Cumberland-gate between eight and nine o clock—I intended to be home by eleven o clock—I have never taken a walk in the park but twice before in my life—never more than three times I am positive—nothing ever happened to me in the park before—I never had any charge made against me or by me before MR PAYNE Q Had you any suspicion of him when you turned under the barrier to go with him A No I am still in Mr Peter s service WILLIAM KEMBALL police-constable A 106 On the 29th of Oct I was in Hyde-park near the magazine which is on the north side of the Serpentine near Kensington-gardens and the barracks I saw the prisoner and prosecutor a short distance from me walking towards Kensington-gardens apparently—when they had passed me fifty or sixty yards I heard a cry of Police and Stop thief —I immediately ran to the spot and saw the prisoner running away—I immediately sprang my rattle and called to the prosecutor to follow—he followed him some distance—I saw the prisoner stopped by Hardwick my brother officer—I picked the stick up after he was taken in the direction he had run and near the spot where he was stopped Cross-examined Q Did the prisoner say the young man had taken indecent liberties with him A Not to me—it was to my brother officer THOMAS HARDWICK police-constable A 174 I was in Hyde-park on the 29th of Oct I heard a cry and a rattle sprung—I saw nobody but ran in a direction towards the cry and saw the prisoner on the north side of the Serpentine running away towards the bridge of Kensington-gardens—I overtook him and desired him to stop or I should knock him down—he stopped—I asked him what was the matter—he appeared in a state of agitation and did not speak at all—I sprung my rattle—the prosecutor and my brother officer came up—White said he had been stopped and accosted by the soldier who demanded his property and that a handkerchief some halfpence and a stick had been taken from him—that was all he had got and he had demanded his coat from his back—I picked up a silk handkerchief within three yards of the spot where I stopped the prisoner—on my way to the station the prosecutor knew me and called me by my name—I recognized him—the prisoner heard him call me by my name and desired me to walk alongside him and not with the prosecutor as he said he knew the result of these cases and wished me to walk with him—twenty or thirty yards further on he said You are known to the prosecutor I have a good silver watch in my possession which I will give you there is but three of you if you will let me at large sooner than have the disgrace of the charge you are likely to make against me —I searched him and found 6 1/2 d and a farthing on him a silver watch chain and seals—among the copper was the halfpenny which has been produced Cross-examined Q That is all that passed A It is—I will swear he did not say the prosecutor had been taking indecent liberties with him not to the best of my knowledge—there was nothing of the sort mentioned—I recognized the prosecutor when he made himself known to me by having lodged at his uncle s—I am not generally on that beat—I am very seldom in the park—I had not been there the night before—I was there a fortnight before—I never saw the prosecutor in the park before in my life—his uncle lived in John-street Golden-square—I had not the least idea of meeting the prosecutor in the park—I left his uncle s in 1842—I think I saw the prosecutor once since that at Mr White s his uncle when I called but not since till the present time—I saw his mother at the uncle s three or four months ago—I saw her here and at Marlborough-street office with her son—I have spoken to her—she merely asked how I was—I never spoke to her on this affair MR PAYNE Q Did you know of this young man being in the park this night A No nor did I recognize him till he called me by name COURT Q

WILLIAM KEMBALL re-examined I called to the prosecutor to follow the prisoner—the handkerchief and stick were found near the spot where the prisoner was taken—I picked the stick up before the prosecutor had come up to that spot and in the direction the prisoner had run—the prosecutor secutor had not got to that spot he was a few yards distant—the handkerchief was within three or four yards of the stick—the prosecutor had reached that spot before the handkerchief was picked up but not where the stick was GUILTY ** Aged 28 — Transported for Fifteen Years

t18450407-825  825 JOHN STACK and JAMES DARBY were indicted for feloniusly assaulting Charles Green they being armed with certain offensive weapons with intent to rob him —2nd COUNT for feloniously cutting and wounding him in and upon his head with intent to do him some grievous bodily harm MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution CHARLES GREEN I am a clerk in a mercantile house and live in Berwick-street Soho On the 28th of Feb about half-past ten o clock at night I was going home from the City—I had been drinking somewhat freely I remember reaching Great Russell-street Bloomsbury—I went into the Blue Boar there and called for a glass of gin and water—whilst I was standing at the bar Darby came in and asked me if I wanted a cab—I declined it—he still wanted me to have a cab and was very importunate with me to have one—I do not remember his having any of my gin and water or his bringing in any other person—I cannot recollect how long I was in the house—I remember coming out of the Blue Boar and going to the Blue Posts at the corner of Hanway-street and Tottenham Court-road—I was followed by Darby who still wished me to have a cab—I do not remember seeing any second man before I got to the Blue Posts—I left the Blue Posts and went straight along in the direction of Crown-street—I there turned up a court for a natural purpose—after I left the Blue Potts Darby still wanted me to have a cab and he was joined by another man—I observed that before I turned up the court—whilst I was up the court I remember receiving a blow on the head—I then lost my senses entirely until I found myself in a chemist s shop—I was taken home that night—next morning Stack was brought to my bedside in order that I might look at him—Sergeant Wells asked me if I could identify him as the man who was drinking with me on the previous night and whilst I was looking at him very earnestly he said I did not strike the blow COURT Q Are you quite sure Wells did not ask whether you could identify him as the man who struck the blow A He did not say that—he said Can you identify this man as the man who drank with you in the Blue Posts and before I answered while looking at him he said I never struck the blow I never saw the gentleman before I met him at the Blue Boar —I said You vagabond you are one of them you have committed yourself —he made no answer to that—I cannot recognise Stack as being either of the men—I have no doubt about Darby—they were perfect strangers to me Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q The first time the second man appeared was after you had left the Blue Posts A Yes—it was about half-past ten o clock when I first entered the Blue Boar—I had been drinking freely before that—I had a glass of gin and water at the Blue Posts as Darby asked me to treat him—I cannot recollect whether we had one each—I have no recollection of stopping and speaking with any party when I came out of the Blue Posts—I did not stop talking to Darby or any one for ten minutes or five minutes or for any time—I do not recollect stopping—I can take on myself to say I did not stop—after leaving the Blue Posts I went immediately over to Crown-street—I did not go to another public-house opposite to my recollection—I cannot undertake to say I did not—I had been drinking freely and might not recollect it—this court in Crown-street was not in my way home but I had been accustomed to go that way formerly and it was very natural for me to go that way to avoid High-street St Giles which is not a respectable neighbourhood—that was when I lived in the same place—it was my intention to turn down Sutton-street but I went into George-yard which is I suppose not more than a dozen yards beyond Sutton-street—I never remember seeing George-yard before—I have seen it since—it is a broad entrance from Crown-street not very broad—it is not quite so broad as Crown-street—I turned on the right side of the entrance—I went down I should say about three four or five yards—there is a stable door on that side and some wagons at the extremity of the yard but not near the entrance—I examined it about a week ago in the middle of the day—at the opposite corner to where I was there is a gin palace—I cannot recollect whether it extends considerably below where I laid—I do not know whether there is a fire-station at the lower part of the yard—I only examined it in a casual way—I observed a projection on the side where I was supposed to have laid—it is a round pipe—I observed s grating before I came to the pipe a little below the surface—the surface of the yard is all even quite as even as Oxford-street I should say except this small grating which is an interruption to it—to the best of my recollection the grating is about half-a-dozen yards from the entrance of the yard—I cannot say positively whether I observed a sharp ring round the pipe about two feet from the ground—I had no appointment to go to Hendon or anywhere next day—I do not recollect speaking to Darby about meeting me next morning with the cab—I will not swear I did not speak to him about a cab nor that I did not treat him to a glass of rum and water at a public-house after leaving the Blue Posts—there is a public-house at the opposite corner just as you turn down Crown-street—I think it was with half-a-crown that I paid for the glass of gin and water at the Blue Boar MR BODKIN Q You had been accustomed to go home to Berwick-street through Sutton-street which turns out of Crown-street A Yes—on this night from the influence of what I had taken I went beyond it—after leaving the Blue Posts I can only recollect receiving a blow—I do not recollect any talk I might have had—I had no business at Hendon and know no one there—I remember receiving some change at the Blue Boar—Darby had no doubt an opportunity of seeing that COURT Q Have you a distinct recollection of having received a blow A I have—I cannot say whether at the time I received it I was standing or not—I cannot recollect whether I unbuttoned my clothes when I turned up the gateway—the only recollection I have is of receiving a violent blow while I was up there—I have no recollection in what position I was at the moment it was given Q Cannot you recollect whether you were looking down the gateway or towards the wall A The only recollection I have was the sense of very acute pain on the head from the blow—I do not recollect going up there—I suppose I went up there for a natural purpose—I have no distinct recollection of any thing after I left the Blue Posts till I was at the surgeon s shop except having received the blow—I remember the fact of the blow on my head—I do not remember how I fell whether I fell or not or whether I was struck after I fell LETITIA TERRY I keep the Blue Boar in Great Russell-street—Mr Green came into my house on the 28th Feb about twenty minutes past eleven o clock—he called for some gin and water—whilst serving him I heard the noise as of a cab stopping at the door—it came up not more than a minute after Mr Green came in—on the cab stopping Darby the cab man came into the house—I did not then perceive that Mr Green was labouring under the effects of liquor—Darby looked in Mr Green s face and laughed rudely—he persevered in laughing—at last he touched his hand to his hat and said something to Mr Green which I did not hear—in consequence of this conduct I paid rather particular attention to him—I thought it looked rather strange—Mr Greeen offered him his glass to drink—he then asked if he might not let his mate drink and he called Stack from the other door which opens into Caroline-street—he called him by some Christian name but I cannot recollect what—upon that Stack came in and drank—the glass was then given back to Mr Green he put it to his lips gave it back to Darby and went out of the house—Darby then said to Stack Here catch hold he gave him the glass and followed Mr Green quickly—Stack emptied the glass and followed quickly after Darby—I recollect their persons—Mr Green paid me for bis liquor with a half-crown and I gave him change—I cannot say whether either of the prisoners were present at the time he pulled out the money—it was paid for just as I gave it to him—I think I was giving Mr Green the change when Darby came in Cross-examined Q Were you examined at the Police-office A No—I was present on two occasions I think but was not examined—I did not know either of the prisoners before—the first time I again saw Darby was at Marlborough-street on his first examination—that was about three weeks after—they had but one glass of gin and water and that was between the three—no one but me was serving we have not much custom at that time in the evening—Wells the policeman asked me to go to the police-office—I only saw Darby the first time I went—I saw Stack at the last examination—I think that was on a Saturday morning about three weeks ago—I think Mr Green remained in my house about ten minutes certainly five—I cannot recollect by what name Darby called Stack in—it did not sound like a surname—Stack came in from the Caroline-street door and Darby gave him the glass in his hand JURY Q Did you observe when Mr Green paid you whether he displayed any more money than the half-crown A did not notice THOMAS SPRIGGS I am pot-boy at the Blue Posts public-house in Tottenham Court-road On the 28th of Feb about half-past eleven o clock at night Mr Green came there in front of the bar—there is a tap-room which lies backwards towards Hanway-street—about the time Mr Green was at the bar Stack was in the tap-room—Darby was with Mr Green at the bar drinking gin and water—I knew the prisoners before by their using the house—they are cab men—they generally came into the tap-room together and were acquainted with each other—on that day Darby had been driving Stack s cab—they were at our house together about twelve o clock in the day—Stack said he would go out to the bar to see if his cab was on the rank and get his money—I do not know who was driving the cab in the day but Darby drove it at night—whilst Mr Green and Darby were drinking at the bar Stack came out of the tap-room to the bar and said he would go out for a cigar—he asked Darby for his money Darby would not give it to him but said Will you have a drop of gin and water with us which he did—I was shutting up the house and Mr Green called for another fourpennyworth of gin and water—they had two fourpennyworths altogether—Stack had some of it and Darby also—I shut up the house and about five minutes after twelve I let Mr Green out—I opened the door for him—he was sensible enough to know where he was and what he was about—I could see that he had been drinking—there are two doors to our house—Mr Green went out at the Hanway-street door—Darby went out directly after—Stack remained at the bar—in about ten minutes somebody came in for some gin and I saw Mr Green and Darby standing on the opposite side of Hanway-street talking—it is a very narrow-street—Stack was in the bar at that time—about five minutes after that Stack went out—when Mr Green paid for the last fourpennyworth of gin and water he pulled out some money—I did not see how much he had but if I am not mistaken I saw a sovereign in his hand among the silver—the prisoners were there then and had an opportunity of seeing that—he had more than enough to pay for the gin and water—I saw him put it into his pocket after paying Cross-examined Q Stack was in the tap-room when Darby and Mr Green came into the bar A Yes he came into the tap-room about eleven o clock and stopped there—I should say he had been in about half an hour before Darby and Mr Green came in—I did not serve him with anything to drink but I saw him in the tap-room—when I let Stack out Darby and Mr Green were gone from the other side of the way—I let about three other persons out with Stack and closed the house—Mr Green gave the barmaid a shilling for the first glass of gin and water—she is not here—I am sure I saw gold in his hand and I believe it was a sovereign MR BODKIN Q Do you mean you had seen Stack in the tap-room half an hour before Mr Green came in A Yes and he was there all the while till Mr Green came into the bar—I was examined before the Magistrate and made my mark to what was read over to me—it was about eleven or half-past when Stack was in the tap-room—it was between the two times—I know it was about half-past eleven when Mr Green came in—I had seen Stack in the tap-room about twenty minutes before—I went direct from the tap-room to the bar to fetch a pot of beer for Stack and saw Mr Green there—that was the first thing I served him with—at least I did not serve him I served the other people that paid for it and he drank out of it—I saw Stack for the first time that evening when they ordered the beer and when I went to fetch it I found Mr Green and Darby at the bar COURT Q How long had Stack been there friten you went for this first pot of beer A About twenty minutes—when I got to the bar Mr Green and Darby were there—they had just got the glass of liquor made—it had been mixed and to the best of my knowledge Darby had the glass in his hand Q Did you not say just now that the first you saw of Stack in the tap-room was when you were ordered to get a pot of beer A Yes that was the first time I observed him—I had not observed him before that night—he was in the tap-room before I was there but I did not observe him before I went for the pot of beer—as soon as they gave me the order for the pot of beer I went straight to the bar and there saw Mr Green JAMES CLARK police-constable C 55 I was on duty on the 28th of Feb in Crown-st St Giles about half-past twelve and saw a cab standing at the end of George-yard in Crown-street—George-yard is about ten yards wide—it is a carriage-way and there is a foot-pavement on both sides—it is no thoroughfare—it leads to stables and buildings of that sort—there is a gin-shop at the left-hand corner as you go down the court and stables and a fire-engine house on the right side—the cab was standing right opposite George-yard about the centre with the horse s head towards me—I was coming up towards Oxford-street—Darby was sitting on the box of the cab—when I came in sight of him I heard him call out very quick and sharp Here here here s the Bobby —they call the police Bobbies—I had my uniform on—he turned his head towards George-yard as if speaking to some person up the yard and I immediately saw Stack run out of George-yard and spring on to the box of the cab with a whip in his hand—I could not say exactly what kind of whip it was—he had it in his right hand—the thong part was before him and the butt-end behind him—he was holding it near the middle—he took the reins from Darby I did not know Darby at that time and attempted to drive away—he started the horse turned it round and was driving it furiously away whipping his horse during the time I was after him down Crown-street towards Tottenham Court-road—I followed and overtook the cab at the end of Sutton-street which is about fifty yards from George-yard—I there stopped the cab and found the two prisoners on it—I am quite sure they are the men—Stack was driving—I asked Stack what was the matter as he was driving away in such a furious manner—he said Nothing at all —I asked him again and he made no answer—I then asked him to show me his badge—he took it out from underneath his coat and showed it to me without making any difficulty—I saw his number and took the number of the cab and seeing no one inside the cab I told him he might go—he said You b - - and so can you —he then drove on towards Tottenham Court-road—I immediately returned to George-yard and there found Mr Green lying down on his side with his hat off and a pool of blood under his head—I noticed a wound in his head from which the blood was proceeding very fast—he was very insensible—I procured some assistance and had him taken to Mr Kenny s a surgeon in the neighbourhood where his wound was examined—he was nearly ten minutes after he got to Mr Kenny s before he came to his senses sufficiently to tell me where he lived—I then went home with him—he had one sovereign four shillings sixpence a 4d piece and one penny in his pocket—I noticed blood three yards before I came to the pool under his head—he was lying with his head towards the buildings down the court and his feet outwards towards the carriage-road—I noticed blood about three yards from his feet towards Crown-street—I suppose he must have gone or staggered those three yards whilst he was bleeding—on the right-hand side of the court is a plain brick-wall—his head was about a foot and a half from the wall—I noticed no blood whatever near or on the wall nor any pipe handy—there is a rain-water pipe near the top but that is ten yards from where Mr Green was found ten yards further up the court from the street—it is a round pipe that comes down by the engine-house—I did not notice any projection of any kind from the wall near where Mr Green was found or in any part of the line marked by the blood—there ia no projection on the ground at that part—his head was on a flat paving-stone two feet square as plane as a deal board—there is not the least unerenness in the surface Cross-examined Q When did you examine this yard a second time A As soon as I came back on my beat—I have since examined it in the day-light—I am sure the water-pipe is ten yards further up the yard than where I found Mr Green—Mr Green s head was lying about eleven yards from the entrance of the court—the pipe is somewhere about twenty-one yards from the entrance—there is no pipe between the entrance and where I found Mr Green—there is a grating on the ground about three yards below the pipe towards Crown-street—I saw the blood before I took Mr Green up—there was no gas-lamp near—there was one about ten yards from him at the top of the yard on the left-hand side—I did iot take him up towards the lamp—I held him against the wall till I got the assistance of a brother constable and then I took him down towards Crown-street—I had examined Mr Green before that and seen the wound in his head and the blood running from it—I lifted him up before I examined the yard but I saw the blood three yards before I came to his head before I lifted him up while he was on the ground—the first objects that caught my attention on going into the yard were the spots of blood on the pavement—his feet were about three yards from the spots of blood or rather better perhaps—his feet went across towards the carriage-road—there is a fire-station in the yard—the firemen are generally up of a night but they are very often asleep—I have been on the beat some time—there is a large public-bouse opposite this place—where I found Mr Green is beyond the public-house on the opposite side of the way not far beyond—I pointed out the place where I saw Mr Green to one of the firemen next morning—I found an umbrella sticking in the grating—that grating wss about three yards before I came to Mr Green and is below the surface of the yard—it would not be easy to stumble over it—it is a very little below the surface—I did not measure it—I will swear no portion ofit is three inches below the surface—it is nearly level—the portion nearest the wall inclines rather more than the other end—the cab had gone fifty yards when I came up to it—I was about thirty yards from it when I first noticed it and when I heard the words Here s the bobby I ran after the cab and while it was traversing a space of fifty yards I had travelled eighty—there are one or two small courts on the other side of the way much narrower than George-yard—I do not know that the public-house at the corner is in the habit of being open late—I never saw any persons in it after twelve—I have seen their own people up and talking after twelve—this was about half-past twelve—they always close their doors at twelve MR BODKIN Q Did you continue to walk sharply towards the cab after first seeing it A Yes—by the time Stack had got on the cab and turned it roundy I was within about ten yards of it—this grafting in which the umbrella was is between the street and where I found Mr Green about eight yards up the wall on the right-hand side—it is a very small iron grating over an area about a foot square—there are two gratings in the yard—Mr Green was lying about three yards beyond the grating in which the umbrella was sticking—the first spot of blood was about two feet beyond the umbrella and it continued spot by spot till I came up to Mr Green—I suppose the grating was three yards or rather better from his feet—he was lying across the court—his feet were rather further from Crown-street than his head—the second grating is ten yards further on—the track of blood was straight towards his head not to his feet—the public-house was closed at this time but there was a light in the parlour—the pavement is about two feet or two feet and a half wide—the blood I saw for the three yards appeared to me just as if it had dropped from a person—I took the umbrella home to Mr Green MR GREEN re-examined I had an umbrella that night—it was brought to me by Clark—I did not take particular notice of the distance of the pipe from the entrance of the court—I have not yet quite recovered THOMAS WELLS police-sergeant C 1 In consequence of information I received I looked after the prisoners—Stack lives at No 3 Petty s-place or court—I went and found him there in bed about half-past nine on Saturday morning the 1st of March—I asked his name which he told me and also the number of his badge—I had seen him driving a cab before but I did not know him by name—I asked whether he was at Crown-street last night with his cab—he said he was he had followed a gentleman down Crown-street to know what time he was to fetch him in the morning and that there he had lost sight of him and had not seen him since—I told him he must dress himself and go with me—I took him into custody and conveyed him to Mr Green s house COURT Q Are you quite sure when you saw him at his house you did not tell him what you took him about A I think I did tell him I came about a gentleman who was struck—I am not quite certain—he was shown to Mr Green and while Mr Green was looking at him he said I did not strike the blow —Mr Green had his head bandaged up at the time and his eye was looking very black—Mr Green said You are the vagabond —he said nothing more—Stack was then taken to the station Cross-examined Q Have you examined the yard since this occurrence A I have—I should say the pipe is from sixteen to twenty yards from the entrance—it is very near the engine-house—the spot where Mr Green lay was shown to me by Clark and the blood at the time—the pipe is four five or six yards from where the pool of blood was where his head lay—I only observed one grating—that was about in the centre between the two pools of blood close to the wall—there were two pools of blood—the grating was about a yard and a half from the pool furthest from Crown-street and about the same distance from the other—the two pools were about three yards apart—I did not measure it—I think the pool furthest from Crown-street was nearly opposite the side of the public-house—the pool of blood was not about the same distance from the wall as the grating—it was nearer the kerb-stone on a flat stone about a foot or eighteen inches further from the wall COURT Q Then were these two pools of blood by the kerb-stone A They were on the stone next the kerb both in a line and there were spots between the two—there were no spots before I came to the first pool—I particularly examined that—the first blood I saw was the first pool then some spots then another large pool and there was no blood whatever beyond that—that was nearer the centre of the yard than the grating—the yard is very little resorted to of a night—in case of fire the engines come out MR BODKIN Q When was it you made this examination A A little after two o clock the same morning with a lantern—I also examined it again in the morning by daylight—Mr Green had been removed some time before I examined the spot—I have no knowledge of the state of the blood before he was moved—I was not there when he was moved COURT Q Then one of these pools of blood might have been made on the spot to which he was moved A It might and the drops between the pools also JOHN JAMES ALLEN policeman E 159 I took Darby into custody on the 26th of March at Mr Kelly s No 9 Drury-lane—I had been looking for him from the 1st of March but was not able to find him—told him I took him for the concern of Jack Stack in Crown-street—he said it was a bad job and he was about to say something—I told him if he made any statement to me I should have to give it as evidence against him—he said all he recollected of the concern was that he met with a gentleman at the Blue Pig and they had something to drink there that they afterwards went to the Blue Posts and afterwards to Jarvis s which is a public-house in Hanway-street —he said he went back again to the Blue Pig to see if Mr Hattersall was going to ride home and he met the gentleman again that the gentleman spoke to him again and asked him if he would have something else that he said he would have some of the old sort that they had some gin and water that he was drunk and recollected nothing afterwards Cross-examined Q Do you know George-yard A Perfectly well—I have not examined it since this occurrence—I know there is a pipe on the right hand side of the way near the engine-house between fifty or sixty feet from the entrance—I have not been there for the purpose of examining the yard COURT Q Did you observe any grating on the right-hand side A Not in particular—I have only been there for the purpose of calling the engines in case of a fire JOSEPH KENNY I am a bachelor of medicine and a general practitioner and live in High-street St Giles s Mr Green was brought to my house early in the morning of the 1st of March by the two policemen—he was bleeding profusely and completely insensible —I immediately perceived a wound on the side of the head—I examined it and probed it—the bone was denuded but did not appear to me to be injured—it was not fractured—it seemed to have been caused by some blunt inttrtmeot having struck it—it was partially contused but was completely divided in the centre—the edges were partially jagged—it was a contused and lacerated wound such as might be caused by a hard blow from a blunt instrument—it was a very severe blow—the butt end of a whip might have produced it—the wound was perpendicular—I eould not positively say in what way the instrument struck the head—I think a similar wound might have been received by a fall if he had fallen against a sharp projection—I do not think a fall on a smooth paving-stone could have caused it—I have not seen the spot where this occurred—I attended Mr Green for about a week afterwards Cross-examined Q Was not the direction of the wound exactly sudh as would occur to a man who stumbled and fell his head coming against some sharp projecting instrument A That depends upon what be fell against—it might be produced in that way—the wound wae something more than an inch long—I think the butt end of a whip would productd a similar wound COURT Q Could the injury have been produced if the nan stool behind him at the time and struck with his right hand with a whip A I should think the person must have been either at the side or in front of him—I think it could not have been produced by a blow from behind—it is on the right-hand side of the head—I think if the blow was struck from behind the position of the wound would have been different perhaps nearly at right angles but it is altogether conjecture on my part—I think person must have been before him—if he struck him standing on the same side the wound would have been in a different position—I think such a blow could be produced by a man striking him while standing and I should say the man stood in front of him and then struck him directly downwards—I do not think a fall against an ordinary water-pipe would have produced such a wound THOMAS WELLS re-examined I observed no blood whatever near the pipe—it was full three or four yards from it—the pipe is much further up the yard MR O BRIEN called ROBERT SEDDON I keep the Fox and Hounds 264 Tottenham-court-road—I have known Darby about four years and Stack I dare say three years and know nothing against them—Darby has been in my employ several times—on the night in question Mr Green and the prisoners came into my house at half-past twelve o clock and called for a glass of rum and water—I served him—he called for a cheroot which I gave him—he then asked some persons to have half a gallon of half-and-half—a gentleman said No we will have the best ale or nothing and he said Then you will pay for it yourselves —a cab man asked him for a screw of tobacco and he gave it him—he asked what he had got to pay—I told him 17d —he pulled out of his left-hand coat pocket a sovereign 1s 6d and a halfpenny among some pieces of biscuit—he gave me a crown-piece and I gave him 3s 7d

into it before—I went in quite by accident—I think Esworthy had been in the house before but he did not know it at the time—it was the first house that was open—we were smoking when we went in—I spoke to one of the women—I did not put my arm round her waist nor touch her that I know of if I did it was with my arm as she stepped up between me and my friend—she spoke to my friend first and to me afterwards—she asked him to treat her—he refused—she then asked me and I refused—I mentioned that at the Police-court—the land-lord had served me with a pint of half-and-half—I drank out of it and set it down to Esworthy-before he drank she asked him again to treat her—and he said If you like you can drink out of that —she put it to her lips but whether she drank any I do not knowthis was before I received the blowI was on one side of her and Esworthy on the other—it took a very short time—I might be there five minutes or more before any blow was struck—I did not speak to any other woman—I think there were two or three in the room—Hodnott did not come up to me—he said nothing to me—I cannot say that he came up while I was talking to the woman—I will swear he did not speak to me—he was close to me—he said nothing to the woman that I know of—the landlord was there—he served me—I was not turned out of the house nor was Esworthy to my knowledge—I was not there when he left Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q I suppose there was some noise A Not much—there was talking—I was talking to my friend while the woman stood between us—I said nothing else to her—she stepped up between us as soon as we went to the bar—there was no disturbance in the room only what took place between the prisoners and me—the door was shut against me after Lyons got out by parties connected with him I have no doubt—there was a short struggle to get out at the door but no particular violence—the bar is in an oval direction—I do not know who snatched my watch—it was taken at the time I received the first blow on my cheek—I did not turn round to strike again but to ask what it was for—I also received a slight cut on my left hand which appeared to be from a sharp instrument—the chain which fastened the pin was a thin gold chain—the two ends of my stock came out and the chain was broken MR PARRY Q I suppose there was a black satin front to the stock A Yes that was torn off—I did not receive the least assistance from the landlord or anybody in the house—I was prevented from leaving the house by other parties besides the prisoners—my watch was in my left waistcoat-pocket—I had on the coat I have now—it was not buttoned—the chain was visible ROBERT ESWORTHY I am a clerk at present out of a situation I lodge at No 68 Lower Thames-street I have known Dolby three years—I was in his company on the evening of the 14th of Oct at the Surrey theatre—we left at about a quarter past twelve o clock—we went into a cigar shop and afterwards into the Bridge-house public-house Borough-road in our way home—there were fifteen or twenty persons standing at the bar—a girl spoke to us—I did not treat her—she drank out of the half-and-half which we had—while standing at the bar Hodnott and one who is not in custody came up to me and asked if I knew a young man named George who the person not in custody told me was in the detective force and he went on telling me he would give any money to find him—I asked him what his other name was—he said Townsend and I told him I did not know the name he said he himself belonged to the detective force and was under the Forresters and said he was stationed round the Bank I then heard Dolby say What is that for and I saw him and Lyons scuffling together—as I was going to Dolby s assistance I received a severe blow from Hodnott and fell down—on getting up Hodnott knocked me down again—I got up and saw Lyons rush out of the house and Dolby after him—there was one man at the door who prevented Dolby going out—others surrounded and struck me—I got up and put my hands up to my eyes to save them from being blackened but I had a black eye the next morning—after receiving several severe blows for five or six minutes I managed to get out of the house and on going up the street I saw Dolby and the policeman talking together—I afterwards saw Lyons in custody about one o clock or ten minutes after —Hodnott remained behind—I saw him taken about one o clock the same morning—I afterwards saw Dolby s pin without the chain found on the floor in front of the bar—neither the landlord nor anybody rendered me any assistance Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You went in with cigars in your mouths did you not A Yes—there were three or four women inside—one woman was standing in front of us—we did not touch her at all—she asked me to treat her—I said No —then she asked Dolby and he said Here is some half-and-half if you like to drink out of it —I lost nothing—I had no watch chain or purse—I had a few shillings in my pocket—I was not turned out of the place Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q When you turned round how were Lyons and Dolby A Scuffling together with their hands on each other—that lasted till Lyons rushed out—I saw nothing till I heard Dolby say What is that for MR PARRY Q Were any other persons smoking besides you A Hodnott was smoking a pipe—I did not observe any more smoking JOHN WISE police-constable M 84 In consequence of information I apprehended Hodnott about half-past twelve o clock on the morning of the 15th in James-street Union-street Borough-road in the street—Dolby had him on the ground when I came up—I told him he must come with me for the assault and robbery—he said Very well I will go with you John —I know the Bridge-house perfectly well—it is generally open till two or three o clock in the morning—it is a general practice for persons to be smoking there Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q That observation applies to every house does it not A Yes Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q You found the stock and pin A The front of the stock was found by the landlord who is here—I did not see him pick it up—I saw him stoop in front of the bar—that was within a quarter of an hour after I had apprehended Hodnott about one or half-past MR PARRY Q Were Dolby and Hodnott struggling A Not at the time—Esworthy was there and two or three other persons—there was a female there—I know her—she is connected with Hodnott COURT Q Did either party call you A Esworthy called me—Dolby and Esworthy were together at first going in pursuit of Lyons—Hodnott passed us and Dolby said he thought he was one of the party—Hodnott was drunk FREDERICK LITCHFIELD police-constable M 50 Between twelve and one o clock in the morning of the 15th of Oct I saw Dolby and Esworthy—in

t18460105-452  452 THOMAS SMITH was indicted for that he with a certain other person being armed with offensive weapons viz pistols and daggers did assault Thomas Phillips on the 14th of Dec putting him in fear and robbing him from his person and against his will of 1 10l Bank note his property and ANN JONES for feloniously receiving the said note well knowing it to have been stolen MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution FRANCES GALLAVAN I live at the house of Mr Thomas Hamblin No 3 Crayford-road Camberwell On Sunday the 14th of Dec a few minutes before eight in the evening there was a knock at the door—I opened it and found the prisoner Smith there with a letter in his hand which he asked me to deliver to the lady of the house—I asked him where he brought it from—he said It is all right take it to the lady of the house —I asked him again where it came from—he still said it was all right did I choose to deliver it to the lady of the house if not he would shoot me—he put his hand into his pocket and drew out something which I took for a pistol—it was rather in the dark but something shone—I then took the letter from him—Catherine Hamblin was at that time at home—I went and delivered the letter to her in the kitchen—the prisoner was in the hall—she went into the drawing-room with it—the man stood in the hall and I stood in the passage which is the same thing—he was about three yards from the stairs or not quite so long—I observed that he had a pistol in one hand and the white handle of a dirk or dagger in the other—Mr Phillips came out of the drawing-room and Mrs Hamblin after him—Mr Phillips asked the prisoner by what right he demanded money there—I could not hear what the prisoner said—I then heard Mrs Hamblin say something to Mr Phillips but I do not think the prisoner was near enough to hear what passed—she was on the stairs and he was in the hall where he was at first—Mrs Hamblin then went up stairs—I did not see her go up—I heard the prisoner say he would give two minutes before he called his men in to plunder—Mr Phillips then went up stairs after Mrs Hamblin—he came down again and went to the prisoner in the hall—I did not hear distinctly what he said to him—I did not see him give the prisoner anything but he spoke to him and then he went away—Mr Phillips followed him to the door—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man CATHERINE HAMBLIN I am the wife of Thomas Hamblin and live at No 3 Crayford-row Camberwell I was at home a few minutes before eight o clock on Sunday evening the 14th of Dec —I heard a knock at the door about that time—I was in the kitchen—Mrs Gallavan who lives in my house opened the door—I heard an altercation at the door—Mrs Gallavan came to me in the kitchen and gave me this letter Read— For the lady of the house My Lady I write these few lines to inform you that I have been sent here by a gentleman for your money and I must proceed in getting it and if you refuse me the men outside twelve in number will come in and plunder the house and if you make any noise your lives will be in danger The kitchen is on the same floor as the hall—I went from the kitchen into the hall—it is a square hall and as I passed I saw the man standing—the prisoner Smith is the man to the best of my knowledge—I went through the hall into the drawing-room—Mr Phillips was there—I read the letter to him and I think delivered it to him—I was very much agitated indeed on reading it very much alarmed and terrified I thought my life was in danger and I made my way out of the house by the back door—I saw the servant next door and told her to run immediately for the police—I then came back to the hall—I found Mr Phillips there—he made some communication to me—I do not know whether the man heard it—he was still in the hall—I think it was in the hall that Mr Phillips told me this but in my agitation I do not recollect sufficiently—in consequence of what he said I attempted to go out at the back door to get money for the man seeing he would not go out without—I did not hear him say so—on my attempting to go out at the back door the man interfered to prevent me with a pistol in his hand—he said You don t pass here and closed the door—finding I could not pass that way I went again into the drawing-room and attempted to open the window to get out that way but the man came out at the back door and round the garden and faced me at the window as I was in the act of pushing it up—the drawing-room is on the ground-floor and looks to the back of the house—there is a flower-bed under the window—I was in the act of pushing the sash up and he came and lifted up the pistol with his face close to the window—I saw the pistol distinctly—he was just in the act of raising it and was close to the window—upon that I quitted the window and went into the hall and the man had come back and was in the hall—he did not speak to me or do anything then—I went up stairs—I could not find any money anywhere and I went to see if I had got any up stairs—whilst I was up stairs I heard the man in the hall say Is that lady coming down —two minutes more —during the whole of this time I was in a state of very great alarm indeed—Mr Phillips came up stairs after me—he pulled out a 10l note and after telling me what he intended to do he went down stairs with it Q Except from the terror and alarm in which you were placed from what you have described would you have parted either with Mr Phillips s 10l note or any money of your own A It was to get rid of the man from the terror of being shot—I was willing to part with any money of my own or any that I could get to relieve myself from the danger and fright I was in THOMAS PHILLIPS I am an agent at the Custom-house and live in Wellington-road Stoke Newington—Mrs Hamblin is my sister-in-law I was paying a visit to her on Sunday night the 14th of Dec and about eight or shortly after she came to me in the drawing-room where her sick husband was lying— I did not hear the knock —she was in a state of the greatest agitation and alarm—she produced this letter and read it to me on hearing which I went into the hall and saw the prisoner Smith—I went up to him and said Pray what is your business here sir —his answer was I am come for the money there is in the house and if I don t obtain it in a very short time I shall immediately call in the men that are outside and the house will be plundered —I saw a dirk in his right hand which he evidently wished I should see and whilst he was speaking with me probably with a view to alarm me he drew from his left hand pocket a horse pistol—he did not say anything but went to the street door opened it gave a whistle and in came a second man armed as he was with a dirk in one hand and in his other hand what I believe to be a horse pistol—they spoke together—I did not hear what they said—there was not light enough in that part of the hall for me to distinguish the features of the second man—he stood just by the entrance of the door—there was a lamp on the left hand and the light shone obliquely—I at first hesitated for a moment whether I should not make a grand dash at Smith and upset him which I thought I had strength enough to do but when I saw the other man close to his elbow I thought it would be a very imprudent thing—I then went through the passage towards the garden and he went too—I saw Mrs Hamblin very shortly after—she had been out as she has described and came in from the garden—Smith said If I can obtain 10l I will go away immediately and take my men with me —Mrs Hamblin then went up stairs—she had not been up stairs half a minute before the prisoner called out Is that lady coming down stairs in a kind of authoritative tone and he said If she is not down in two minutes with the money the men shall certainly come in and plunder the house —there was no other person in the house but my sick brother-in-law my sister and Mrs Gallavan—I followed my sister up stairs and recollecting that I had received a 10l note two or three days previously from Williams Deacon and Co I thought I would let him have that because it might be a means of his detection—my sister and I came down stairs together—I went up to Smith with the note in my hand and said Here is a 10l note if I give you this will you immediately be off and take your men with you —he said he would and I gave him the note—I gave it him to get rid of him—I cannot say but I was somewhat alarmed I think if you had been there you would have been alarmed too—there was certainly a terror produced in my mind from what I read and saw—it was from that I was induced to give him the note—my sister continued in a state of great alarm and terror—the prisoner took the note and went towards the hall door—I followed him—he turned round and presented a pistol at my breast and vowed if I followed him or even looked after him he would shoot me—he then went out—I turned immediately from him and he shut the door after him—within about five minutes after he was gone I went down to the police station—Inspector Campbell was not there at that time—he came shortly afterwards—he examined the garden and the drawing-room window and the whole of the place—I think I saw him examine the flower-bed by the drawing-room window—I had received the 10l note from Williams Deacon and Co for this check which I have dated 10th Dec—I received the note on that same day in exchange for this check of Mr Pitman s—the prisoner Smith is the man to whom I gave the note WILLIAM BAKER police-constable P 262 I was on duty on Denmark-hill on Sunday night the 14th of Dec about eight o clock—I know the Crayford-road—there is an opening from Denmark-hill to Coldharbour-lane which leads into the Crayford-road—I was standing at the entrance of that road with Harris another policeman and heard a cry of Police from a servant—I ran down the opening into Coldharbour-lane and into the Crayford-road and went to Mrs Hamblin s house—before I got there I met the prisoner Smith and I believe another man with him—they were coming along Coldharbour-lane towards Denmark-hill in a direction from the Crayford-road—they passed me—at that time I did not know what was the matter—in consequence of what I learnt at Mrs Hamblin s I came back in search of them—I searched all round the buildings but could not find them—I am sure Smith is one of the men I saw pass me on that occasion Prisoner He never saw me before last Tuesday week when he came to take a false oath against me Witness I saw him on the Sunday night of the robbery—that was the first time as far as I know SAMSON DARKIN CAMPBELL police-inspector P division In consequence of information on Sunday night the 14th of Dec about nine o clock I went to Mrs Hamblin s house—the letter which has been read was put into my hands by Mr Phillips—I went to the back of the premises into the garden and observed under the drawing-room window a little flower-bed with some footmarks on it—on the following Saturday I received from a gentleman named Reynolds a 10l Bank of England note which I produce and on the Tuesday following I went to the house No 3 Catherine-place Walnut-tree-walk Lambeth—I knocked at the door—the male prisoner opened it—I asked if Mrs Jones was at home—he said yes and the female prisoner then came forward—I said I came from Mr Attenborough the pawnbroker in consequence of a slight mistake in the change she had received for a 10l note on the 15th—she said the change was all right—I said You recollect the circumstance to which I allude it was when you redeemed a watch in pledge for 2l and paid for it with a 10l note —she said Yes I perfectly recollect it but the change was all correct —I then said I must now request to know from whom you received that note —the male prisoner had retired into the inner room at that time and he might not have heard what passed—she said From my husband —I asked her when—she said On Saturday evening the 13th which was the Saturday evening preceding the robbery—I asked where her husband was—she said he was at work at Uxbridge and he had brought it home on the Saturday night and returned on the Sunday evening to Uxbridge—I asked whom he was at work for—she said she did not know the name but it was for a bricklayer and plasterer—I then gave a signal to Wright the officer whom I had waiting outside and he came in—I said We will step into the inner room and I went into the inner room with her—the officer followed me—the male prisoner was there—I then said The truth is this note has been stolen and your position in the affair will a great deal depend on the answers you give I will now repeat the question I did before Q Did you after any conversation you had with her take her into costody A I did SAMUEL WRIGHT police-constable P 172 I was in company with Mr Campbell on the 23rd of Dec when he went to No 3 Catherine-place—I waited outside—when I was called in I saw the prisoner Smith—I asked what he did there—he said he was a lodger—I asked him how long he had lodged there—he said a month—I asked if he knew anything of the female—he said no he did not—I had seen Jones in the room at that time—I told him I must take him into custody on suspicion of stealing a 10l note—he said he knew nothing about it—in the room where Jones was I saw a quantity of new wareing apparel such as gowns and also coats and things of Smith s—there was the wearing apparel of a man and woman—I asked Jones how she came by them—she said it was out of the money from the 10l note—there was a new coat two pairs of new trowsers and three waistcoats claimed by Smith—he said they were all his property—I believe there were four gowns not quite new—I took Smith to the station and then returned to the room and searched it—in a corner under a box I found this powder-flask with gunpowder in it—and I found this pair of shoes under the bed in the same room—there are two rooms to the house one up stairs and one down—I found the shoes in the down stairs room in which the man and woman s wearing apparel was—I have since compared these shoes with two footmarks in the flower-bed at Mrs Hamblin s house and they exactly fit—the shoe has a military heel and the upperleather is bent very much over the sole—the impression was exact sufficient for me to state on my oath that I believe these shoes made those impressions—the shoes are rights and lefts and the impressions were right and left—the impression of the right corresponded as well as the left—I did it in the presence of a gentleman Smith The shoes were never at the house till the policeman took them there they were not in wear for a month before Jones My wearing apparel had been bought a long time Witness I am sure she said she bought it with the fruits of the 10l note—she said so in Campbell s presence SAMSON DARKIN CAMPBELL re-examined I heard Wright ask her whether the wearing apparel was hers and where she got it from and she said it had been redeemed from the produce of the 10l note Jones I never said that Witness Yes you did GEORGE EDWIN GILL I am foreman to Richard Attenborough a pawnbroker in Bridge-house-place Newington-cause way On Monday the 15th of Dec the prisoner Jones came to our shop to redeem a watch—to the best of my belief she is the person—she paid for it by this 10l note—I gave her the change deducting 2l 3s 4d for the pledge and interest—I wrote the name and address the person gave me Mrs Ann Jones No 3 Catherine-place Walnut-tree-walk and underneath I placed the date on which I took it 15—12—45 —I find my writing on this note LYDIA ELLIS I am the wife of Benjamin Ellis and live at No 1 Catherine-place In May last I had charge of the house No 3—Mrs Jones came with a young woman to take a room at No 3—I asked if she bad a family—she said no she only wanted it for her and her husband—I afterwards saw the person she represented as her husband—it was the prisoner Smith—he assisted in moving the goods in—they lived there together as man and wife and continued to do so up to the time Inspector Campbell came and took them into custody—I quitted the house in July and lived in No 1—I knew them to live together as man and wife and had no reason to believe they were otherwise COURT Q What name did they take the house in A Jones JAMES STUCK I am in the

left-hand side of Bishopsgate-street—I then had two sovereigns eighteen shillings and some coppers in my pocket—I paid for two pints of beer there—Weston was there and Selliss seemed to know him—as soon as we came out Selliss said to me Where are you going —I said To a coffee-shop —he said Come with me —we went to Whitechapel—he said Here is a house open we can have a pint of beer here —I paid for a pint there—Weston and Selliss followed me out—I went to the cab-stand in the middle of the street for a necessary purpose—I was there knocked down and immediately there were three or four persons upon the top of me and I felt them ripping my coat—I heard my coat ripping—I saw no chance and cried Murder murder police —as soon as I cried Murder Weston cut right away from me across the street and stood against the wall as if he had not a hand in it—I saw him run across the street and he was one who had been holding me down—I am positive of that—he was the only one I recognised—the policeman came up—I told him what had happened—I went right straight to Weston—I said Here is one of them and gave him in charge—I did not see Murphy after I was in the house nor Selliss—he came out of the house after me Weston I went into a public-house and met with Selliss and the prosecutor we went to another public-house and had some more beer and gin then we went to Whitechapel and had two pints of beer there he came out with two females and when I came out I found he was knocked down I pulled a young woman off him he hallooed Murder and I took her off Witness No he did not—my money was all gone and my pocket and the back of my coat with it—the money was in my coat-pocket DANIEL FOLEY I live in Gun-square Houndsditch I was in Whitechapel and heard a cry of Murder —I saw the prosecutor knocked down by Murphy—I am positive of that—when he was down I saw him put his knee upon his breast—he muffled him about and he took from his person some black or dark thing like a pocket—he got up and ran up a little avenue—I followed him and opposite Whitechapel church he turned back—I said You ought to be ashamed of yourself knocking that man down and doing what you have done —he said It was not me —I never lost sight of him—he said he would go home—he ran across Whitechapel—I followed him and cried Stop thief —the policeman Kelly came up—Murphy ran up a little avenue and we lost sight of him—there was a turning in the avenue—I am positive he was the man Murphy Q You say you saw me knock him down could not that man hare held me by the collar A I could not tell that—his back was turned when you struck him and there were three or four people and a woman—I was nearer to you than I am now—I did not collar you—I did not like to interfere where there were three or four able strong men—you ran up a little avenue between Whitechapel church and where the butchers have their shops—a female came up—you had no opportunity of giving anything to her because I followed you close up—you ran across Whitechapel-road and up a passage—I did not see you afterwards till you were in custody—I gave information of the very dress you wore that night which was a fustian jacket and corduroy or fustian trowsers COURT Q Did you see his face A I saw his face but could not swear whether he was pock-marked—I swear by his person and his dress and his face as well—I saw his face to enable me to swear to him—I saw him next day and I knew he was the man—I swear he is the man that knocked the prosecutor down—I have no doubt of it WILLIAM BROWN police-constable H 145 I heard a cry of Murder about four o clock—I went up and saw Weston—I asked him if he had heard a cry of Murder —he said Yes pointing to the prosecutor who was sending about two yards from him—I asked the prosecutor if he had been robbed—he said Yes THOMAS KELLY police-constable H 119 I took Murphy—I told him what for—he said he was not there at all—I told him it was useless to say so as he was seen—he then said he came out with the prosecutor and was with him—I had chased the man on the morning of the robbery and to the best of my belief he is the man I chased—he was dressed as Murphy usually dressed Murphy Q You have known me four or five years can you say anything against my character barring twice for a row A Yes you are always with thieves—I never said I would transport you if it lay in my power Murphy s Defence I was in the Horse and Leaping-Bar on Friday morning the 20th the man said Will you mind my door I said I shall go home in a few minutes I was going home Selliss and Weston came in then the prosecutor the prosecutor paid for two pints of beer and then for bread and cheese and beer for two prostitutes and he left these men he then came out Selliss was the next that

t18460223-785  785 ALFRED JONES was indicted for feloniously inciting one Thomas Smith to do and commit a certain felony of which he had been convicted See Third Sess p 414 MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution ROBERT MARSHALL STRAIGHT ESQ I act as clerk of the arraigns of this Court I produce the record of the conviction of a person named Thomas Smith the principal named in this indictment—I find it on the files of the Court duly signed by Mr Clark as a record made up— read FRANCES GALLAVIN I am a widow On Sunday the 14th of Dec I was living at the house of Mr Thomas Hamblin No 3 Crayford-road Cold Harbour-lane Camberwell—it is a detached cottage—Mrs Hamblin was at home and Mr Phillips Mrs Hamblin s brother-in-law was there—Mr Hamblin is an invalid—a few minutes before eight o clock I heard a knock at the door—I answered it—I found a man at the door with a note in his hand—that man was afterwards tried at this bar in my presence by the name of Thomas Smith—he offered me the note and said Deliver that to the lady of the house —I said I should not deliver it unless he told me where it came from—he said Do you choose to deliver that to the lady of the home if you do not I will shoot you and he produced a pistol from his pocket— the outer door was not shut at that time —that alarmed me and I took the letter and delivered it to Mrs Hamblin who was in the kitchen at the time—I believe this to be the letter looking at it —she took it through the dining-room into the drawing-room to Mr Phillips—the street door was open at that time to the best of my recollection—Mr Phillips was in the drawing-room with Mr Hamblin who has been confined to his bed for the last eighteen months—Mr Phillips came into the passage to the man who was standing in the hall and asked what business he had there—I did not hear him answer—Mrs Hamblin came into the passage—a few minutes after she went up stairs—the man still continued in the passage—after she had been up stairs a few minutes he called out Is that lady coining I will give two minutes —Mr Phillips went up after her and came down and said he had a 10l note in his pocket should he give him that and Mrs Hamblin said Yes —Mr Phillips came down with the note and said to the man would he go quietly if he had that 10l which he produced—I did not hear his answer—Mr Phillips gave him the note and he went away—as he went through the passage Mr Phillips went up the steps to follow him to the street door—when he came into the hall after I had taken the letter I observed that he had a dirk or dagger in one hand and the pistol in the other—I saw the handle of the dirk plainly CATHERINE HAMBLIN I am the wife of Thomas Hamblin and live at No 3 Crayford-road On Sunday night the 14th of Dec Mrs Gallavin brought me a note a little before eight o clock—I was in the kitchen—this is the letter—it terrified me very much on reading it—Mr Phillips was by my husband s bedside at the time—he had been paralysed for twelve months and that was known in the neighbourhood—I showed the letter to Mr Phillips—he came out of the room and passed on to the hall—I had seen a man standing in the hall—that man was convicted here by the name of Thomas Smith—Mr Phillips spoke to him—I went out at the back door into the garden to the next door neighbour s through the garden door to give an alarm—the man could not see me go out at the back door as the hall is not straight—on my return I found the man in the passage—Mr Phillips told me if I would give 10l the man would go out quietly—I said if I could find 10l I would—Mr Phillips produced a 10l note—I allowed him to give it from the fear of all our lives—after saying I did not know whether I had got 10l I went to the back door and said I must pass through to get the 10l —Smith placed his back against the door and shut it to and said You don t pass here —at that time he had a pistol and dagger in his hands—I afterwards went into the drawing-room and opened the shutter—the man hearing the shutter moved went into the garden and came round and met me at the drawing-room window as I was attempting to open it and presented the pistol—I left the window and came back into the passage and in my fright I went up stairs to see for the money—my brother-in-law eventually gave the 10l note—he said Shall I give it him —I said Yes —when I came down the man was gone THOMAS PHILLIPS I was at my sister-in-law s house on this Sunday night—I recollect the knock at the door and her showing me the letter—I went into the passage and saw the man standing at the door who I afterwards saw tried and convicted here by the name of Thomas Smith—I asked him his business—he said I have come for the money in the house and if it is not handed over to me I must get it —I told him we lived in a free country and were not in the habit of having our money demanded and asked what he meant by it—while speaking to him having a dagger in his right hand he pulled a horse pistol out of his left hand coat pocket—he then went to the entrance door opened it gave a whistle and in came a second man armed as he was—I could not identify that man as he stood in the dark—it was not the prisoner I believe—he was a shorter man—I at last handed over to Smith a 10l note—he said if he had 10l he would leave the house and take the men away whom he had brought with him and had outside—when he was going out of the hall I followed him and he turned round immediately presented a pistol at my breast within twelve inches and vowed he would shoot me if I followed him or looked after him—I parted with the 10l note for fear he would alarm the invalid if he knew of it—I was not particularly alarmed about myself SAMPSON DARKIN CAMPBELL I am an inspector of police I was sent for on this evening and went to the house of Mr Phillips—I received from him the letter produced—I afterwards went on the 23rd of Dec to No 3 Catherine-court Walnut-tree-walk Lambeth about a mile and a half from the prosecutor s—I there saw a man passing by the name of Thomas Smith and took him into custody and also a woman going by the name of Ann Jones—I have been in search of the prisoner since then in consequence of information I received—he was brought into my charge at the Camberwell station on Thursday the 3rd of Feb —I remember Smith being convicted—Ann Jones was acquitted—she is here to-day under the name of Ann Hales SAMUEL WRIGHT police-constable P 172 I took Smith into custody—I saw the prisoner in custody at Camberwell station on Thursday the 29th of Jan before he was examined before the Magistrate—I did not hold out any promise or threat to him—he commenced conversation by crying and said the way he became acquainted with Smith was by his sister living at Mr Greathead s butter shop Prisoner He came to me and said I am sorry for you how came you acquainted with Smith and I told him he said he thought I had fallen into bad hands Witness He said Smith s sister lived at the butter shop and by that he became acquainted with Smith—I do not recollect that he said he himself had lived at Greathead s SAMPSON DARKIN CAMPBELL re-examined It might have been on the 29th of Jan that he was brought to the station LYDIA ELLIS I am the wife of a bricklayer living in Albany-road Camberwell In Oct 1844 I went to live at No 3 Catherine-place Walnuttree-walk Lambeth—in May 1845 a man came to lodge with me in the name of Thomas Smith—his wife took the place in the name of Ann Jones—I staid in the house until July—I then left them both in the house and went to live at No 1 Catherine-place—I staid there until Jan 1846—I know the prisoner perfectly well by sight—he was in the habit of coming to No 3 while I was there and since I left—he always visited Mrs Jones or Thomas Smith—he was very often in and out with them—sometimes he would come in by himself and sometimes with them—he was intimate with them—that continued up to the time Smith was taken into custody—I know he visited them after I left until Jan 1846—I remember Sunday evening the 14th of Dec last—I saw Smith just about dusk that evening I should say between five and six o clock go out with the prisoner and another man—the prisoner is lame—the other man was shorter than the prisoner Prisoner Q What induces you to say it was exactly that Sunday A Because on the Tuesday before Christmas-day Jones was taken—I saw you three pass my window—I believe the other man was Sam—I knew him by sight ELIZABETH PLACKETT I am the wife of Henry Plackett and live at No 7 Catherine-place—I know the prisoner—I know the house No 3 where Smith lived—I frequently saw the prisoner going in there and frequently in company with Smith—I have seen them come home together and go out together—on Monday night the 15th of Dec last as near ten o clock as possible the prisoner knocked at Smith s door several times but could not get in—he whistled—somebody inside said Ben is that you —the prisoner answered Yes and he got in at the window—I do not know whether it was opened from the inside or whether he opened it—two or three days afterwards I saw him again coming down the same court—he appeared to have a new coat on then WILLIAM ROBERT PLACKETT I am the son of the last witness—I lived with my mother at No 7 Catherine-place last Dec —I knew Thomas Smith who lived at No 3—I remember Campbell and the officers taking him into custody one night—I know the prisoner and have seen him with Smith—I saw him on the night that Smith was taken after Smith was taken away—I saw him come up and look in at the window of No 3 at the time the officers were in the house and he immediately ran away—I have never seen him there since THOMAS GREATHEAD I am a cheesemonger and live at No 50 Bridge-road Lambeth—about four years ago the prisoner lived with me—he was upwards of a year in my service as porter and carried out goods—he signed receipts when he received the money—I have sometimes seen what he has signed and I have seen him write very frequently—I have been able to form an opinion of the character of his hand-writing—I believe this letter to have been written by him COURT Q Is there any peculiarity in his hand-writing A There is in his beginning a great many words with capital letters—he always uses the letter A as a capital—he never made a small one Prisoner Q Did you ever see me write a letter A No I have seen you write in the school JOSEPH HENRY ROBINS I live with my uncle George Robins a surgeon in Bedford-street Covent-garden—the prisoner was about a year in hit service and left about eighteen months since—I have seen him write and have directed letters which he has written—I know he has a custom of generally beginning sentences with capital letters—I can express an opinion at to his handwriting—I believe this letter to have been written by him Prisoner Q When have you seen me write A When you wrote letters and wrote on pieces of paper and in your pocket-book places where you were to go to COURT Q Have you seen him write sufficient to form a judgment of his handwriting A Yes ELIZA NEWBERRY I am the wife of John Newberry a gold-beater and live at No 43 Brook-street Lambeth—a man named Thomas Smith came to lodge at my house last Christmas twelve months and stopped four or five months—that same man was tried here—he came to us by the name of Jones—I have seen the prisoner at Jones s—he was there nearly every day I believe while they were there—Smith had a sister named Lucy—I have seen the prisoner write letters to her and write directions for her and have seen them after they were written by him—I have had such opportunities of seeing his writing as to enable me to form an opinion of his writing—he has written bills for me—to the best of my belief this direction on this letter For the lady of the house is his handwriting—the rest of the letter is written larger than I have seen him write—I cannot say whether that is his or not Prisoner Q What letters have I written for you A None only bills for washing to different people and also receipts COURT Q Is there anything remarkable in his writing A Nothing particular only it is his style of writing as he wrote for me GEORGE EDWIN GILL I am foreman to Mr Attenborough a pawnbroker in Bridge-house-place—on the 15th of Dec I received this 10l note at our shop from a woman who gave the name of Mrs Ann Jones No 3

also knew him when living at Mrs Ellia s by the name of Smith—he was in the habit of visiting my husband—he often came to our house—he came much about the same when at Catherine-place as at the other place—my husband wrote very little—I remember the prisoner writing a note for him—I received from my husband a 10l note—I took it to the pawn-shop of Mr Attenborough in Bridge-house place on a Monday—it was the day before that Monday that the prisoner wrote the note for my husband—my husband told him he wanted him to write a note—he dictated the terms of the letter to him—I heard the Crayford-road mentioned by my husband to him and there was something said about Cold-harbour-lane but I did not pay much attention to it—I heard my husband say it was to be addressed to the lady of the house and the prisoner wrote according to my husband s direction looking at the note —I cannot swear to the writing but it appears to be the same note—I can read writing—Ibelieve this is the note—it was written in the afternoon—very soon after it was written my husband and the prisoner went out together—my husband did not come home all night—he came home next day and gave me the 10l note—he saw the prisoner that day—I believe he lived in Upper-marsh at that time—I saw him and my husband talking together on that Monday after I got the 10l note—I saw no portion of it given to the prisoner Prisoner Q You say the letter was written in the house and you heard the contents A Yes some of it—I heard Crayford-road mentioned Prisoner There was a letter written but it was to a young woman I was to be married to this year Witness I am sure that is the letter—I did not hear my husband tell him why he wanted it written—I heard nothing said about what was to be done with it—I heard that twelve men were to be called in if they did not get the money MR CLARKSON Q Was the note he wrote about marriage or money A Not about marriage at all Letter read— To the lady of the house—My lady I write these few lines to inform you that I have been sent here by a gentleman for your money and I must proceed in getting it and if you refuse me the men outside twelve in number will come in and plunder the house and if you make any noise your lives will be in danger MR GREATHEAD re-examined I did not know that I had a sister of Smith s living at my house but I have reason to believe I had Prisoner s Defence I say there was no such letter written there was one written addressed to a female in Lamb s Conduit-street to whom he was going to be married in Feb I left the house with him and went to a public-house at the corner I had half-a-pint of beer with him and then left him I came next day as usual and shortly afterwards received a letter from my friends to say that they had a situation for me I applied for the situation and got it which caused my absence from the place—I came back having left the situation and was taken into custody charged with stealing the note I know nothing at all about it I have known the man two or three years I have no friends in attendance I could prove that that woman has been receiving trifles from inspector Campbell and sergeant Wright to

wrapper was taken off Clune s neck again and shown to him—he claimed it—this is it produced —he described it as a wrapper about a yard square and a small piece of white cotton or silk I do not know

how he got it but he had it in his hand—I saw some man give it into his hand who I do not know—it was picked off the ground—Adams took it off the ground but he passed it to another man and the man passed it to him again—a young girl now outside heard me say There goes a man with the watch —it was picked off the ground—he gave it to another man that man gave it him back and he ran towards the

was looking on all the time but sometimes Dean was down and I could not see—I could not see Adams all the time—I did not see him use any violence—I went to Dean s assistance and found Murden ill—using him but not when he was first knocked down—I was too frightened to go up then there was such a crowd and soldiers often get ill—used in that street Toy Q Did you see me have the handkerchief A No nor with the poker ROBERT PARKINS I live in St Ann s—street On the 17th of Aug at not quite seven o clock in the evening I saw the prosecutor pass my shop—he had a watch in his hand seeing what o clock it was—a female and a soldier were with him—there were some people in the street—they had not got many steps from my window before I heard Toy say to Mary Goldsmith Will you fight —there was a scuffle between them—Dean tried to separate them—I sat down to my work and did not notice them as fights are so common there—I saw a mob gathering and got out of my window to fasten the shutters—I had not time to get out at the door—just as I got out Brown dragged something from Dean s body about his fob—Dean was then just rising on his knees—I cannot say what it was—he passed it to Toy—she passed it to the hands of Adams who took it and ran off as hard as he could past me towards the Three Elms—before the watch was taken I saw Toy beating Dean over the head with a poker—that was at the commencement of the row—I then sat down to my work and afterwards on getting up to put to the shutters I saw something handed to Adams and saw nobody but Toy strike Dean with a poker—I saw Murden there standing among the mob at the time the robbery took place—I did not see him do anything—he was close to Brown—they were all in a body together Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q There was great confusion A Yes—it is a terrible place for disturbances—unless it had got worse I should not have noticed it—I am often obliged to close my shutters JURY Q Did you see Dean knocked down a second time

and knocked him down—he was jumped on in the most brutish manner and kicked—Murden gave him a very severe kick on the fore-part of the head when the blood flowed in a dreadful manner—I did not expect the man would recover—it was a most brutal attack—he was jumped on and bruised when he made off to try to get his property—I did not see anything done to Dean s handkerchief Toy Q What sort of poker was it A A short one as far as I could see—I could not see that it was a watch Brown took but firmly believe so because I saw a small part of the dark ribbon as it was placed into Adams hands—a girl standing by me said There goes the watch Brown Q Can you say it was a watch in my hand A No—Dean was just rising on his legs—a great many people standing by said There goes the watch —I had seen a ribbon attached to it when it was in Dean s hand Murden Q Had you seen me in the row at-first A Yes you stood there and when they ran towards the Elms you ran too—I did not threaten to have anybody s expences stopped unless they swore you kicked the man in the head—I never said I wished you sent across the water—I did not know you—I would not live there for double the rent if I could avoid it ELIZA WANDLEY I live with my father and mother in Great St Ann-street On the 17th of Aug I was looking out of the window and saw Dean come by talking to two females—Mrs Goldsmith went on not above half a yard from him—he was talking to the other young woman—the prisoner Toy called the woman very bad names and said Go along from my door —Dean said he would not he was allowed to stand and speak on the highway—Toy stood up to Mrs Goldsmith and said Do you want to fight —Dean said No she is not in the humour for fighting —Toy said If you are not I am and struck her twice—the second blow knocked her down—I did not see Mr Goldsmith there at the time—when Mrs Goldsmith was down Toy was on the top of her beating her with her fist—Dean went to pick her up—he was keeping Toy off with his hands and while he was stooping Brown ran out and said Will you strike her and before Dean could answer him Brown knocked him down—he rolled on his back and Brown and Toy were beating him Toy at his head and Brown at the lower part of his body—he rolled over on the curb—Jane Wisdom who is not here twisted his handkerchief off his neck and held it up—Mrs Goldsmith stepped in and took it from her—Harding came up and said Mother give me the handkerchief —Wisdom went in to where she lived next door to me got a poker and struck Dean with it—Toy took it from her and used it as well—she beat Dean with it—it was not Toy but Wisdom that took the handkerchief from what I saw—I am sure of that COURT Q How near does Wisdom live to Toy A They both live in the same house—Murden was standing on the pavement talking to his master but I did not see him have anything to say with it—I saw Adams fighting with John Harding—Harding ran up the street and went to the Elms for protection but was pulled out Q What did Adams do A He was standing in the row a yard and a-half from Dean who was on the ground—I did not see the transaction out—I heard Emma Bell hollow out There goes Black Frank with the watch at the time he was running to the Elms—I did not see the watch Cross-examined Are you sure Adams was not by till some minutes after the row commenced A Not till five minutes after—a female ran into the public-house and called out Here is a row —Adams then came out with a great many more—I cannot say whether he took any part in the fight with Dean—I saw Harding soon after the handkerchief was taken—he took the handkerchief from his mother s hand and put it in his bosom and Adams directly struck him—it was after that he was fighting with Harding—Adams was in the crowd with the prisoners—I saw Harding try to get into the Elms—Adams tried to prevent him taking him by the collar—Wisdom took the handkerchief off—Adams was then in the crowd a yard and a half from Dean—it was after that he began to fight with Harding—he was not four yards from him—I only saw it from the window—I did not see Adams in contact with anybody but Harding and that was five or six yards from the public-house but you question me so fast you will not let me answer you—I did not see Adams touch Toy on the shoulder and say Come out or you will get into trouble JURY Q Did you see the prosecutor knocked down the second time A The first time not the second—my window is rather slanting towards them and on the same side as the row happened—I saw Wisdom untie the handkerchief—Toy might have had it—I saw Toy strike Dean over the head with the poker—she was beating him in the face at the time Wisdom took the handkerchief and he was resting on Wisdom s knee SAMUEL BRINE police-constable B 33 On

public-house A Yes three or four years—I never had him in custody—it is a very low neighbourhood—if anybody is in custody there is a mob to prevent our taking him DENNIS DEVINE police-constable B 61 I saw Dean after the row—I saw Adams pass and heard a female in the crowd say Adams has got a watch —a few minutes after Adams came from towards the public-house and said Here I am if you want me —Dean was afraid to come out below that until the crowd dispersed—he did not give him in charge at that time—the watch has not been found Cross-examined Q Did a soldier say That is not the man A Not in the prosecutor s presence—he was in the passage—I should know the soldier if I were to see him—it was not the witness Brown—I have known Adams some time—he has borne a general good character—I believe he is a quiet peaceable man—I understand he has assisted the police on different occasions MR HORRY on behalf of the prisoner Adams called MARGARET NEAT I am the wife of a labouring man and live in Old Pye-street On the 17th of Aug between six and seven o clock I was in the Three Elms and saw Harding and Adams there—Adams does jobs for the publican—Adams and Harding went out—Harding came running back—he ran behind the bar and Adams tried to get him out—he got him out—while he was doing that I heard a voice say I have lost my watch —Adams was not out then—he was in the house then and for three or four minutes after that—I kept inside and saw nothing further—Adams had been out before I heard the cry but I do not think he went out further than Mr Crosbie s door—they had both gone out some time before—Adams had been no further than the door—I was at the bar when I heard the cry—Harding ran in and all the people went with him—they were all tipsy—Harding ran back—Adams could not get him out and the landlord tried—Adams was at the door and ran in to get him out—no I beg your pardon he did not go out it was the prosecutor and the people with him—Adams was standing at the door before I heard the cry—Adams had been sitting down in the tap-room before I heard the cry Cross-examined by MR BALDWIN Q How long had you been in the house A About twenty minutes—I had not been out at all during that time—I have sworn that Adams had not been out of the house for two or three hours—I went in before and saw him and when I came back he was in the same place—when Harding and the rest of the people went out Adams was in the bar—a young woman called him out from the bar—I saw him go from the bar as far as the door—I was standing at the bar with my face towards it—I did not look for Adams at all—the door was on my left—he was at the door—I cannot exactly say whether he was outside or in—he was not a yard outside before the cry about the watch because I stood looking at him—I had no particular reason for noticing him Q Did not be follow Harding in A Yes he ran in from the door after him—I could not have my eye on him particularly for they ran in all in a rush—he could not have gone three or four yards from the door without my seeing him COURT Q Had he the door in his hand holding it open A The door was fastened back with a chain—he stood right in the doorway so that no one could come in or out—his face was towards the street when Harding came in—they got him out and the publican shut the door shutting Adams and Harding out and would not let anybody in—it might be three or four minutes after the cry about the watch that Adams went out—he was getting Harding out at the time Q Why did the landlord shut his waiter out A I suppose he was glad to get rid of them—there was a crowd round the door—I saw no more of Adams MARY WATTS My husband is a bricklayer We live in St Ann s-street in the same house as Mrs Goldsmith—on the 17th of Aug about a quarter to six o clock I went to the Elms with Mrs Goldsmith—we had two pots of ale—Mrs Goldsmith was very much intoxicated—she got up and begun to dance—she afterwards came and threw her bonnet and shawl and the key of her door at me—after that she went to the prosecutor over the table and said I want 1s —he said Here is 2d and threw it at her—she at last took it and gave it to a man who plays the fiddle—she shook her pocket at him and said I have two or three shillings —after that she called the prosecutor—he jumped over the table and went out—at that time Adams was in the tap-room talking with me—I saw a person who I understand is Mrs Goldsmith s husband but she lives with Dean—a woman came and said Do you know where Mrs Goldsmith s shawl and bonnet is —I said I have got them —presently her mother came and said they had gone up the street—Adams was at the bar then—I went out and saw the prosecutor fighting men and women fighting together in all directions one was down on the other—I saw the prosecutor down—it frightened me so much I ran up the street for a policeman but could not find one—the mob was to great I ran into my own passage looked out of my window and saw Mrs Goldsmith s husband and her son come to my passage—presently I saw Mr Goldsmith and the prosecutor arm-in-arm coming up stairs with his face bleeding—they came up stairs—I opened the door to them and ran down to get water to wash his face with—I did not see Adams by Dean at all—I was so frightened I ran to fetch a policeman—I had left Adams standing at the door of the public-house Toy s Defence I was going to the Park to meet Brown when I came out there was Dean and Goldsmith and another woman named Ann quarrelling my landlady told them to go away they used very abusive language Mrs Goldsmith turned round and called her several names I came out I had been ill my landlady told me to go in Mrs Goldsmith took off her cap and threw it into the street Dean immediately came caught hold of me and pulled me into the crowd Brown was drunk the row was most dreadful John Harding came up and kicked me and so did Dean I showed the Magistrate the marks at Queen s-square all my things were torn off my back I had not a bit of anything down to my waist I am quite innocent of the watch and am certain Brown is innocent I never saw it before or since I never had the handkerchief in my hand Mrs Goldsmith took the handkerchief from the man s neck I had bruises on me for a fortnight Brown handed in a written statement representing that he was the worse for liquor stating that Dean Mrs Goldsmith and others were using very abusive language and were ordered by the landlady to remove from the front of the house but Mrs Goldsmith refused and endeavoured to strike the landlady but struck his wife instead he then interfered and was ill treated and he had now surrendered to take his trial being entirely innocent of any robbery Murden s Defence I was standing at the gate talking to master and never went near the

half-crowns 80 shillings 42 sixpences and 9 groats the monies of Joseph Levy and beating striking and using other personal violence to said Henry Clements MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution HENRY CLEMENTS I am seventeen years old and live at Deptford lam in the employ of Joseph Levy as assistant collector of tolls at the Stamford-bridge-gate in the Fulham-road—on Wednesday evening the 7th of Oct about six o clock I received from William Gulliver the toll collector there two parcels of money wrapped in brown paper—I was to take them to the Kensington-gate and give them into the hands of Mr Levy—I was in the habit of going there with the money—on my way there I had occasion to come into the Gloucester-road in the parish of St Mary Kensington—when I got there between six and seven o clock the prisoner Lampert passed me— I had seen him a few day s previously when he got a few yards ahead of we he looked round and looked in my face—when I got 300 or 400 yards further into the cross road leading to Fulham I was walking in the middle of the road the prisoner Greeney stepped out of the side of the hedge and murmured something—as I did not understand him I stayed to hear and then he and four others rushed on me—Lam pert was one—they forced me to the ground—two took hold of me by the throat another covered my eyes with his hands—I had the money in my outer coat pocket—they began rifling my pockets—this lasted a few minutes—they kicked me on the head or hit me with a stick I will not be certain which—it was a violent blow and made a large swelling on my head—there was blood on my ears from a kick or hit—that was while they were taking my money—they all ran away—I hardly knew for a minute or two where I was but on recovering I got up put my hand to my pocket and found my pocket was cut out and the money gone—I went on met Sparks the constable and told him what had happened—I returned to Kensington and told Gulliver and then went to Mr Levy—I had seen Lam pert two or three days before when I was on the Honey-lane bar Fulham-road—he came there one day and said to me Halloa —I said Halloa he said Who is down at the other gate —I told him thinking him to be one of the other turnpike men but I did not know him Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q All this did not take many minutes A Not very long—there was a hedge on both sides of the road-there were houses about 100 yards off—my eyes were covered nearly all the time they had hold of me—I had never seen Greeney before—I was taken to the station to see whether I could identify Greeney—the door of the cell was open—I looked at him and said he was not the man but he was not brought out of the cell—I have not heard of the money since—I do not know how much there was Lampert I never asked you a question in my life for I never knew you I have been on the gates three years myself and know better than you about the money Witness You did MR CLARKSON Q You never bad a-doubt of Lampert A No—I first saw Greeney after this took place at the police-station between eleven and twelve o clock in a cell—I will not be certain whether it was light or dark—I said then I thought he was not one but when he was brought out to be taken to Hammersmith I said to the policeman I was sure he was one who came into the road—seeing him at this bar I have not the least doubt of him WILLIAM GULLIVER I am collector at the Stamford-bridge-gate for Mr Levy I sent Clements to take the two parcels of money to Mr Levy at the Kensington-gate—that is usually done on the Wednesday evenings—one packet consisted of 6l 10s in silver which I had collected myself—it was wrapped in brown paper—the other parcel I received from the conductor of an omnibus—it was sent to me on Tuesday by Pitt the collector at the East-lane-gate and was wrapped in brown paper—it was my habit to send the boy with the money—it was in similar paper to this— looking at a piece —it was this colour—I saw Clements after he came back—he had blood about his face and on his person and seemed much exhausted—he told me what had happened Cross-examined Q To whom does the money belong A To Mr Joseph Levy—this paper would not contain all the money JOHN PITT I am collector of toils for Mr Levy On Tuesday the 6th of Oct I packed up 2l 14s in silver in brown paper and delivered it to the omnibus man to carry to the next gate which Gulliver had charge of—it was in such a piece of paper as that produced—it was similar paper CHARLES WAYT I live at Little Chelsea On Wednesday evening the 7th of Oct a little before five o clock I was in my father s shop right opposite the Goat-in-Boots Fulham—I saw five persons standing at the corner—I took particular notice of them having suspected the prisoners were two of I am certain—I called my father s attention to them—he noticed them as well as me—it was a quarter before five o clock—they all five went towards the Stamford-bridge-gate Fulham-road Cross-examined Q Had you seen them before A Yes often and knew their persons—I knew Lampert well—he lived about there—Stamfordbridge is about a quarter of a mile from the Goat-in-Boots Lampert It was Tuesday night that you saw me and not Wednesday Witness It was on the Wednesday—you had a velveteen coat and cap and corduroy trowsers—I know it was Wednesday because on the Thursday I saw Mr Clements who told me of this—there were four of them at first and one of them fetched you out—it did not rain while you stood there—it had previously and did afterwards—three of you went towards Stamford-bridge on one side and two on the other—I watched you as far as I could see—it is not half a mile to Stamford-bridge MR CLARKSON Q You knew Lampert longer and better than Greeney A Yes but looking at Greeney I have not the slightest doubt he was one of the five CHARLES WAYT Sen I am the father of the last witness On Wednesday evening the 7th of Oct about a quarter to five o clock my son called my attention to five young men opposite our shop at the corner of the Goat-in-Boots—I looked at them so as to enable me to know them again—the prisoners were two of them—after they had been there a short time they went in a direction towards Stamford villas—the prisoner in the velveteen coat went first—two others followed him and two crossed the opposite road—I went away Cross-examined Q When did you give information A The police came on Saturday—on Thursday my son going his rounds heard from Levy s foreman what had happened and gave information Lampert Q How do you know it was Wednesday A It was Wednesday my son fetched me out to notice you knowing you about the neigh-bourhood and on the Thursday my son brought me word of the robbery and that you were one of them—I knew it was the day before—you had on a velveteen coat and cap to the best of my recollection—I did not notice your trowsers—they all had caps but changed their dress I believe after being in custody—I saw you do nothing and know no harm of you—I did not watch you up the Fulham-road—I stood at my door and saw you go up the road LUKE SPARKS police-constable T 67 On Wednesday evening the 7th of Oct about twenty minutes after six o clock I was in the Gloucester-road Kensington—I met five young men in caps most of them in light clothes—they were going in a direction towards the Kensington-gate—the Gloucester-road crosses between Kensington and Fulham—people coming from Stamfordbridge towards Kensington might come down the Gloucester-road—about five minutes after I met them I heard a cry of Police further on towards Kensington—I had not gone more than 200 yards—I ran up to the spot as fast as I could and met young Clements crying and very much exhausted—one of his ears was covered with blood and there was a lump on the top of his head almost as big as an egg—he complained that he had been robbed—I went in search of the prisoners in consequence of what he stated but could not find them that night—on Sunday the 18th Greeney was brought to the station—I searched and found this brown paper which has been produced in his pocket Cross-examined Q Did you find anything else A A small key a knife and a small lock—you are further from Kensington at Stamford-bridge than at the Goat-in-Boots—I was on duty—I noticed all the people I met as well as I could—I am not prepared to swear to the prisoners MR CLARKSON Q Were they about the same size A Yes four were about the same size andone rather taller Lampert When you were brought to look at us and two others you identified two who have been discharged and said you had never seen us Witness I identified two I had seen in Gloucester-road and they were discharged by the Magistrate—there was no evidence of their having done anything I did not say I had never seen the

use other personal violence to him and that they had both been previously convicted of felony WILLIAM TURNER I am a seaman and live at 22 Wellington-place Hackney-road On the night of the 8th Nov about twelve o clock I was in Blackman-street coming from New-cross and close to Union-street—there were about twelve or fifteen men on the pavement—I was walking at a pretty brisk pace but eased my pace as I came close to them—they opened a passage to let me through—I got a shove on my right side and before I bad time to look round my hands were pinioned behind me by four or lire people and I was held by my shoulders—I was surrounded by the whole of them—I directly found myself fast and could not move and felt the money going out of my pocket—I had a purse taken out of my left-hand breeches pocket with twenty shillings in it all in shillings a white handkerchief which was on top of the purse was taken at the same time and out of my right-hand pocket from seventeen to nineteen shillings in half-crowns shillings and I believe sixpences—I called out for the police as loudly as I could and directly received a blow on my head from some hard instrument or other—it was not a fist it cut me—I still called out—my hat was knocked off and I got another cut over my lip from the same instrument—it was something harder than a man s fist—I was then let go and saw a man picking up a hat—I do not know if it was my hat—I ran towards that man as far as Union-street—I felt blood running down my face—I lost sight of him there—running up Union-street I heard a rattle—I did not run further but waited till the policeman came to me—I had a pocket-book in my coat-tail pocket—the coat tail was torn but they did not get the book—my trowsers were torn below the pocket in getting the money out—the prisoner Smith is the man that was engaged at this side pocket or else holding me at the time the other I believe to be the man who I got the two blows from—I am sure he was close to me—I am sure they were both of the party and close about me—Smith was on my left side and Pearson on my right—Pearson gave me two blows—the prisoners were left and right of me at the time I was robbed—the blood ran down into my eye and blinded me—I could not distinguish anybody after that to speak to them—I was taken to St Thomas s hospital-one of the prisoners was brought to me but I could not recognize him at that time as my head was so bad from the effect of the blows—the doctor thought my skull was fractured—when I saw Pearson at the Police-court I had no doubt he was the man who was on my right hand and struck me—I remained in the hospital about half an hour—my lip was cut right open—it required being sewn up—I went about two days after to have the threads taken out Smith Q Where was the first place you saw me A At the Police-court after the act was committed—I do not know whether you had a hat or a cap on at the time of the offence but I think a cap—some had hats and some caps—they all ran different ways—I was left standing—I ran after the man who had the hat supposing it to be mine—I could not identify Pearson that night as my head was dizzy after it was dressed—the policeman asked if I could recognize him—I said I could not swear at the time whether it was the man or not Pearson He said he could not tell who it was he was surrounded by so many Witness I did not say that—the prisoners were so close to me and I was held so steadily with my hands behind me that I had a good opportunity of seeing them—I swear to you by your countenance—you had a blue jacket on the same as you have now—I do not know whether you had a cap or a hat I believe you had a hat and I believe a jacket Pearson The clerk and the Magistrate put their heads together and us prisoners were placed between twenty-four or twenty-five others and before he pointed me out he was asked if the man with the bluejacket was one why not place us among the people in the court and let him recognize us Witness I pointed him out among others and said that is the man in the blue jacket—I am perfectly clear he is the man—I am certain of him JOHN SIMS polite-constable M 164 On Sunday night the 8th of Nov I heard a rattle and cry of Police in King-street—I went towards High-street and saw Pearson running in company with two others one of them I believe to be Smith—I stopped Pearson—he slackened his pace when he saw me and pointing to one not in custody he said That is him stop him —I stopped Pearson and took him into custody—I took him back to the spot and ascertained that somebody had been assaulted and taken to the hospital—the prosecutor said he had seen him before but could not make any charge against him—he appeared stupified from the effects of the blows and was bleeding—he had a good deal of blood over his face—the surgeon had just finished dressing his lip which was cut quite through—it was sewn up—the blow on his head had been dressed—when Pearson pointed out another man as the person I ought to take I asked what he had done—he said there had been a row in the Borough but he himself knew nothing about it Smith Q Why not come at the first examination and state that he said he thought I was the man you did not state it till the third time A I was not there the first day—I knew you were in custody but did not know it was on this charge—you were stopped with a bat—I did not know it was the prosecutor s—I had described who I thought were the men among the force—I stated to the Magistrate that I believed Smith was the party that passed me in the street Pearson Q Was not I running close alongside of you a good many yards I never said Stop that man A He said Stop him that is him —they were the only three people who were running in the street—I should not know the third man he was much taller than either of the others Pearson Q I was behind you how could you know my voice A He was not behind me—I met them THOMAS WATKINS police-constable I apprehended Smith in Mint-square with a hat in his hand and a cap on his head—he was tipsy—I told him what I took him for—he did not ask me what I took him for—I found two shillings in his mouth—the gentleman would not claim the hat at the office—he said he thought it was his but would not swear to it—I afterwards apprehended Pearson and told him what I took him for—he said It is all right I was at the hospital with the man WILLIAM TURNER re-examined I cannot swear this hat is mine but I I believe it to be—I bought mine in Whitechapel or the Minories—here is Patent London Waterproof in this hat—there is no maker s name in it—my hat had Patent Waterproof or London Patent Waterproof in it similar to this—it has been a great deal disfigured since I had it—I think Smith had a cap on when he was by my side—there were two or three hats and caps lying on the ground being left behind by the parties—the man who picked up a hat ran towards Union-street THOMAS WATKINS re-examined That is the direction in which I saw Smith WILLIAM SHEPHERD I am a publican and live in Mint-square—the prisoner Smith came in that night on the 9th of November about one o clock or ten minutes after—I was letting some friends out and he came in with some one else—I cannot say whether he had a hat—I did not serve him—I pushed him out of the house—he was in liquor and I kicked a hat out with him supposing it to be his—it was late and I thought he had had enough—the constable was just outside the door at the time—I am speaking of the night of the 8th Smith s Defence There were four or five drinking in the public-house a young fellow I was apprenticed with came and asked me to have something to drink I know no more about the hat than I do about what I am charged with the policeman says he took me going towards Union-street and where the person ran with the hat was on a different side of the way the policeman says I ran down King-street the prosecutor says the man with a hat ran down Union-street they have made it all up between them—I was intoxicated when I was fetched out of the public-house Pearson s Defence The day after I was apprehended the policeman said he had seen the prosecutor and he seemed to think he could swear to me they have laid their heads together and made the matter up how can the man swear I gave the blow in the confusion I had just come out of the public-house and heard a

sovereigns his monies and beating striking and using other personal violence to him JAMES DYER I am a printer and live in Southampton-court Russellsquare On the 14th of Jan about 12 o clock at night I went into the Prince of Wales public-house London-road—I had been drinking a little before that—very shortly after I had gone in the two prisoners came in—I had just finished drinking something—I observed that Smith had some court-plaster over her forehead-—I said You have an awful wound there how did you come by it —she immediately asked if I would give her some gin—I said I would and she called for it—Rees was alongside of her and partook of the gin—after having the gin I was about going off when they followed me out of the house and requested me to go home with them for a few minutes and sit down—I complied—I went with them to Nelson-place which was very near—a chair was brought and I sat down—Smith asked me to stand some gin—I put my hand into my right hand trowsers pocket in which I had several pieces of silver and gave her some money to fetch the gin—Rees went for it—on her return Smith asked me to drink and Rees poured it out—I refused to take any—I thought from the shabby appearance of the apartment that the liquor might have been drugged and became rather alarmed—as soon as Smith saw that I refused to take any she seized hold of me and called to Rees to come and hold me—she used some oath or imprecation calling her something of a fine woman for not coming to hold me—Smith then took a knife from the table and swore she would cut the b—b— s throat or have his money—Rees came forward and laid hold of my right hand—Smith had hold of me by the left arm—I held my hand in my left side breeches pocket in which were four sovereigns it all happened in much less time than I can tell you she drew my pocket out—she had hold of my left hand with the knife in her hand and she whipped my pocket right out in front where my flap is—thinking she was going to cut it off with the knife I caught hold of the pocket—thinking some man might come to her assistance I made no further resistance but let go my hold—on that Smith drew the money out of my pocket—I saw the edges of the sovereigns glisten in her hand as she drew her hand from the pocket—she immediately walked to the back door saying I am going this knife way —I did not observe what became of the knif—it was a snall table knife—I immediately went to the front door and went in search of a policeman—Rees never uttered a word but remained in the place—I left her there when I came out—I found policeconstable L 93 and made a complaint to him—I returned with him to the house but there was nobody there—we knocked but got no answer—we then went round to the Prince of Wales—I went in first and saw Smith there in front of the bar drinking—I went up to her seized her by the shoulders pushed her to the door and told the policeman that she was the girl who had robbed me—she was then taken into custody—I afterwards saw her searched—I had not given either of the prisoners any money besides what I gave for the gin—I had been drinking a little at the time this occurred but not a great deal—I knew perfectly what I was about Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Had you been in company with any other woman that night A Must I answer that —there was another woman previous to the prisoner s coming in who came into the public-house after I went in of whom I know nothing—she joined my compny as I was standing at the bar—I had a glass of ale and I treated her—I do not recollect whether or not that woman went out before the prisoners came in—I had not been drinking a great deal before I got to the Prince of Wales—I had no purse—I had my silver in my right-hand pocket and the gold in the left quite distinct—I had not agreed to give the prisoners any money to go home with them—they did not ask me for money when I got there only for gin—I gave them no other money but what I paid for the gin—one of them did not demand money for bringing me into their room—I am confident of that—I cannot swear whether the knife was on the table or not when I went in she did not leave the room to fetch it—I think it was in the table-drawer—I was frightened that she was going to cut my throat and so I made no further resistance I was frightened of having my pocket cut and my throat cut also Q But was there any attempt to cut your throat while she was getting hold of your pocket A Only by menaces and the weapon in her hand—my hands were held one by one woman and one by the other—there was no attempt to cut at my throat or to cut through my pocket—Rees was on one side of me at this time holding my right hand—I had my left hand in my left-hand side breeches pocket—no more buttons were undone than there are now one button that my hand might go into my pocket—she ripped the next button-hole off the button and drew the pocket out and seized hold of it MR CHARNOCK Q When did you last feel the four sovereigns safe in your pocket A In the room where the struggle took place JAMES BRADLEY police-constable L 93 On the night of the 14th of Jan about twelve o clock I was applied to by the last witness—I went to the house No 4 Nelson-place with him—I knew the prisoners and knew they lived there—I knocked at the door and received no answer—the prosecutor told me what had occurred in consequence of which I went with him to the Prince of Wales public-house which is a short distance from Nelson-place—when I got there I saw the prisoners inside standing at the bar—I told the prosecutor to go in and see if he could identify the persons who had robbed him—he did so and called me inside the door to take them into custody—he desired me to take Smith into custody and I did so—there are two doors to the public-house—as soon as she saw the prosecutor she tried to escape by the other door—I took her in charge—I saw something in her hand then—I took her hand in mine and kept it closed till we got to the station—at the station-house she delivered 19s 8d in silver from the hand that I had hold of and three sovereingns from her mouth—5 1/2 d in copper was found on her by the searcher at the station—I was not present—when I took the money from her hand she said what money she had got the gentleman gave her—the prosecutor was the worse for drink but quite capable of knowing what he was doing—Smith was rather the worse for drink and Rees was rather worse than Smith—I took Rees into custody the next day at the police-court by the order of the Magistrate Cross-examined Q Then do you mean that Rees was drunk on the next day A No—on the night of the 14th—the prosecutor came to the station-house with me—he was not much the worse for liquor then—I could see that he had been drinking SMITH— GUILTY Aged 23 REES— GUILTY Aged 33 of robbery without violence Transported for Seven Years Confined Twelve Months Before Edward Bullock Esq

together with several more in Broad-street close on the spot—I have seen them together before several times Cross-examined Q Had a crowd assembled round the prosecutor when you came up A Yes—I saw nothing except that his nose was bleeding and he was the worse for liquor—no property has been found HENRY BINGHAM police-constable E 153 I recollect hearing a cry of police at this time—I did not see the prisoners taken—I saw them going along in custody—I saw the female prisoner go to my brother officer when he had got the male prisoner in custody and say You b— you shall not have him and she beat him on the neck and back part of his head and kicked him likewise—I took her into custody and took her to the station—the prosecutor had been drinking but had his senses as much as he has at this present time—he seemed to know what he was about—he walked to the station JAMES KEEPKY re-examined My money might be in half-crowns shilling and sixpence—I am quite positive there were six half-crowns

pencil 6d and beating striking and using other personal violence to him MR PLATT conducted the Prosecution MARSHALL JONES I am a carpenter and live at Black-horse-yard Rathbone-place On 21st March about one o clock in the night I was going home along Oxford-street and saw a female twelve or eighteen yards before me—when I got opposite Dean-street a man took hold of me and pinioned my arms behind me—the female who was in front of me then turned back and attempted to search my pocket—two or three men came up—I saw one on my right one on my left and I think one or two behind me—they searched my waistcoat and side pockets—I felt the women s hands about me but am not certain they were in my pocket but some of the men had their hands in my pocket—the prisoner Higgins is the women and Wynn is the man I saw on my right side I am certain—after hustling my pockets as they could not succeed in getting their hands into my pocket at first I was struck in the face—I cannot say whether Wynn struck me—Higgins did not—they all went away towards St Giles s—I was getting up off the ground having been thrown down by the party who were searching my pockets—some of the party came back and kicked me—I believe it was the male prisoner—he said The old b— you have plenty of money and we will have some of it —I will not swear it was him—I am sure he was one of the three men—he did not search me then—I afterwards gave information to the police went with the policeman to a house in Church-lane and picked out the prisoners as two of the party—Wynn was in the house Higgins came up stairs afterwards and I identified her—I was taken to the hospital and then I missed three keys ✗ pencil and some halfpence—my pocket was gone—I had been at the Mischief public-house in Oxford-street the evening before and saw Wynn at the front of the bar—I am certain of him—the pocket produced is mine Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How long had you been drinking at the Load of Mischief A Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I drank gin-and-water—I called at another house at the corner—I was at two public-houses that night—I was a little the worse for liquor—I was sober enough to identify the prisoners and will swear they are the parties—if I say I drank half-a-pint of gin that is more than I did have—I had no rum or brandy—I had a pint of beer about four o clock and the gin-and-water at ten—I had nothing between four and ten except tea—I told the policeman they had not got the blunt—I had 1l 8s in my pocket—I had a hole in my pocket and it got down inside—when I went to the house in Church-lane Wynn got up to open the door—I did not say I merely thought he was one of the persons I said he was one of them—I had not first given another female in charge—Higgins did not come up to me and say You are drunk —I did not them let the girl go and then take Higgins—there were several girls in the room—I saw the persons at Church-lane an hour or an hour and a half after I had been on the ground—it was not nearly three hours—I believe the prisoners were at the station by a quarter to four o clock—I gave information before that when I was at the Hospital and went to Church-lane as soon as I returned from there—I should say it was about four o clock when the policeman got to the station which is not far from Church-lane—I do not remember the policeman picking me up COURT Q You saw Wynn in the public-house before you were robbed had he the opportunity of seeing the 1l 8s A He had an opportunity of seeing me with silver—he saw I had money I am certain JOHN MURRELL police-constable C 50 On 22nd March about one o clock I was on duty and heard a cry of police —I went and found Jones lying across the middle of the carriage road bleeding from his temple—I lifted him up—he was speechless for a minute or two—when he recovered he said I have got the blunt all right —I took him to the hospital—got his head dressed and went with him to a house in Church-lane—Bingham went up stairs with him—I stopped below—on the way to the station the prisoners both said they had not been in Oxford-street—about four o clock in the morning I picked up a packet at the spot where I had found Jones lying COURT Q Was Jones drunk or sober A He might have been confused by the blow but I should say he had been drinking HENRY BINGHAM police-constable E 53 On 21st March about one o clock I saw the prisoners together at the end of Oxford-street—I had seen✗ them in the Crown public-house Crown-street several times before that—I saw them come out of that house with twelve or fourteen men—about a quarter to four o clock from information I went with Jones to a house in Church-lane—he there identified Wynn the moment he saw him—we looked round three rooms there were four more females one was very drunk—just as Jones got out on the landing Higgins came up stairs on to the landing he identified her directly he saw her—both the prisoners denied having been in Oxford-street at all Cross-examined Q What did Higgins say before Jones said she was the person A I did not hear her say anything he did not charge another young women first—one women sat there very drunk—I roused her up for him to look at her but he did not charge her—I did not hear Higgins come up and say to Jones You are drunk or hear him them say You are the person who robbed me —I will not swear it did not pass—I will swear he charged no one but her WYNN— GUILTY Aged 19 HIGGINS— GUILTY Aged 18 ✗ Transported for Ten Years

personal violence to him MR CAARTEEN conducted the prosecution JERONIMO COLA through an interpreter I am a looking-glass frame maker and live at Back-hill Hatton-garden On Sunday evening the 4th of April I was at a public-house—after leaving I stopped round the corner to make water—while so stopping three men came round me—the prisoner was one of them—he put his hand on my mouth another put his arm round my waist and the third took my money from my pocket—I lost five half-crowns two shillings and some halfpence—I heard them say right when they took it—I understood that—the one that had got me round the waist threw me down on the ground—they then all left me—the policeman afterwards came up with the prisoner—I afterwards found a half-crown a shilling and a penny on the ground near me Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q How much had you been drinking A A pint of beer—the man who had his hand in my pocket said it was all right—there was no lamp near MR CAARTREN Q Are you certain the prisoner is the man that held your mouth A Yes the re was a light under the arch which was about as far from the street as to the door of this Court—there were lights in the street—the archway is a thoroughfare—on the one side there is a street on the other a court and then another street—I think there is a lamp in the middle of the court—it was not so dark as to prevent my seeing the prisoner s face—I do not recollect what sort of a night it was—it was not raining COURT Q Do you know whether either of the men that surrounded you had been in the public-house A There were three or four men there—I cannot say whether the men who came up to me in the court were either of them CHARLES SMITH police-constable G 240 On the 4th of April about half-past twelve o clock at night I heard a scuffling and a cry of Oh police —I saw Cola on the ground and the prisoner on him—there were two others there who ran away before the prisoner got off him—they all got up as nearly as they could together but I distinctly saw the prisoner get up off him—he was dressed as he is now—he ran straight into Gray s-Inn lane to a public-house which has two doors to it—I ran in at the side down to prevent his coming in at the front with his associates—I caught sight of him again running into the next court and did not lose sight of him again till I took him into custody—he was not a minute out of my sight—I is no thoroughfare—he said policeman what have I done You can take me what have I done I bought him back to the prosecutor—I found on him fourpence halfpenny in copper two duplicates and one affidavit—as I was pursuing him I heard money drop from his person which sounded like a half-crown—I did not look over the place where the prosecutor was—he was in Gray s-Inn-lane when I took the prisoner back—it was in Fox-court that I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together—there was a lamp ten or fifteen yards from the place—I have no doubt that the prisoner is the man that got off the prosecutor—I lost sight of him in turning the corner of Gray s Inn-lane—he ran towards the front door of the public-house—he could not get in at the side-door—I pursued him to the side-door to prevent his coming in at the front Cross-examined Q Were his associates with him when he got to the front-door A There was no one person ran out of Fox-court besides him but I fancy his associates were in the house—I have seen him about with them—I heard the money drop at the corner of Charlotte-buildings where he turned down and I took him—I did not look for the money as I brought him back as he made resistance there—that was thirty yards from where I took him—it was not just at the spot where the money dropped that he made resistance—I sprung my rattle for assistance—I did not look for the money till I had been to the station—I returned in an hour with another constable searched and found nothing—I pursued the prisoner as quickly as I could—there was nobody in the street or court but the prisoner—Fox-court is not a dark place—I was ten or twelve yards off when I first saw him and the prosecutor—I heard the cry of Police before I saw them—the moment they heard my footsteps they ran off—I had no lamp—I was in my uniform—they being in a dark spot had a better opportunity of seeing me where the lamp was than I had of seeing them—the lamp shone almost to the edge of where the roof of the court is—I do not know whether the there men all ran in the same direction—I kept my eye on the prisoner—the other two appeared to be in dark clothes—I should say it is ten or twelve yards from Gray s-Inn-lane to the entrance of the court where the prosecutor was on the ground—the prisoner was just running at the corner when I came up—he had not gone above ten yards—he had not got into Gray s-Inn-lane—one end of Fox-court goes into Gray s-Inn-lane and the other in Gravel-lane or Brook-street—I was at the end towards Brook-street when I first saw the prisoner—the archway comes into Gray s-Inn-lane—the prosecutor was ten or twelve yards from Gray s Inn-lane—I did not speak to him at all—I left him on the ground and followed the prisoner MR CAARTEEN Q Was it before you had come to the spot where you heard the money drop that the prisoner made resistance A Somewhere about the spot—he slipped his handkerchief—I said I should hit him if he did and he said he would go quietly—he did not go through the public-house he ran against the front door—I ran in at the side—I did not lose sight of him again till I took him into custody MR O BRIEN Q How far is the public-house from where you took him A Not above eighty or ninety yards GUILTY * Aged 21 — Transported for Ten Years

the Prosecution THOMAS SNEED I am a tanner and live in Pancras-street Tottenham Court-road On Sunday the 28th of Feb at twelve o clock at night I was standing at the corner of Museum-street Holborn my brother Samuel Sneed was standing with me a few paces from me—I had a silver watch worth 3l in my left waistcoat-pocket attached by a steel guard-chain—as I was standing there the prisoner Ragan ran and caught hold of me tight round the neck threw his head over my left shoulder and whispered something in my ear which I could not rightly understand—while I was listening to him I felt some one else behind me rather on my left side where my watch was—they were there perhaps about half a minute—I could not see what they were doing—I felt some one touching me by the side of my back they then left me and ran off in different directions—I can swear to Ragan positively but not to Mara—he is much about the height of the other person—I had not a chance to see his face—when they had gone my brother spoke to me—I looked at my watch-guard and found it hanging down on my right breast and my watch was gone—I am clearly confident it was in my pocket at the time Ragan took hold of me round the neck and when he let loose his arms it was gone—I and my brother and somebody else followed a little way but my brother was not the nearest one to Ragan—the watch has not been found Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Were you alone with your brother A He was conversing with a few friends a few paces distant—they were two men—I saw no woman there—there was not one in our company—I had not spoken to one that evening except my sister—I had been with my two brothers and my sister that evening—I had lately lost my wife—I had not been drinking—I had been enjoying myself at home all day—I had a glass of ale or whatever I liked occasionally—we might have had some gin—we had no rum—we commenced drinking the gin and ale at nine o clock in the evening—I then went to take my sister towards home to the neighbourhood of Blackfrairs-bridge and was returning to the corner of Museum-street on my way back—I stood there a few minutes waiting for my brother who was speaking to two friends of his about taking a cab to Camden Town—I had not spoken to any one between Blackfriars-bridge and Museum-street—I had taken out my watch a few minutes before that as we came out of Mr Roger s house near the end of Drury-lane—after I left my sister I and my brother and his two friends went into a public-house and had about a pot of ale between us—we had no gin there—that public-house is about twenty yards from the corner of Museum-street—I recollect drawing out my watch after we came out of Roger s—not at the door but in Holborn—I had only got it from the watchmaker s that day and had been trying it all day by my brother s to see how it went—I think it was then twenty-three minutes past twelve o clock—I had never seen Ragan before to my recollection Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Where are you employed A In Chenies-street Bedford-square—I am at a currier s shop there—we have tan-pits there—I have worked there for the last nine years—I was drinking in more than one public-house on this Sunday night—I had been at home the early part of the day—sometimes I spend Sunday at home and sometimes elsewhere—when we first left home I should think it must have been about ten o clock at night—we had had tea at home nothing stronger—we had a little rum in our tea—I have not said I had no rum at all—I said I had none while I was out—this was in the afternoon—I do not know how much spirits I had had that day altogether—I do not keep an account—we were in two public-houses—I was examined before the Magistrate on the 10th of March— looking at his deposition —this Thomas Sneed is my hand-writing—I said before the Magistrate that I felt some on touch me on the back—I did not say that before I went before the Magistrate The deposition being read alluded only to Ragan and did not mention a second party Q Do you find one word there about feeling some one behind you at the side where your watch was and touching you at the side of your back A I perfectly recollect being asked that question whether I felt any one at the side of me or behind me and I said Yes —I never swore that I did not—I cannot say why it was not taken down—I was asked if my deposition was correct and I said it was—I did not notice that that was not put in—I swear I said so before the Magistrate—I said I could not swear to Mara and he was remanded—I told the Magistrate I could not swear to Mara till my brother was there to identify him—he was let out on his own recognizance to come again on the 11th which he did MR PARRY Q I understand you not to swear to Mara now but only that it was a man about the same height A That is all—I was as sober as I am at this moment SAMUEL SNEED I am the brother of the last witness and live with him in Pancras-street—I am working as a smith at Watford On Sunday evening 28th Feb about twelve o clock I was standing with my brother at the corner of Museum-street in Holborn—we were talking together about our own matter and the two prisoners came up along with another one—Ragan threw his arms round my brother s neck and held him fast and Mara put his arms round them both and pushed up against them against a door—I took hold of Ragan by the shoulders and told him not to kick up a raw there—in a few seconds he let go and they all three stood about two or three yards apart from us—I looked at my brother and noticed his guard hanging out of his pocket and said to him Tom your watch is gone —I have no doubt the prisoners could hear that—the guard was hanging out of one the button-holes—hecarried his watch in his waistcoat-pocket—I noticed that the watch was gone at the time I said so—the moment I said so they all ran away each a separate way—I am quite sure Ragan is the man who did what I have said and I am positive Mara was the man I them saw—we had been in a public-house about an hour and a half before and Mara was there—I am sure I saw him there—I should not have noticed him so much when this occurred except that I had seen him before—I made a remark to my brother—it was in consequence of seeing him before that I am quite certain he is the man—we ran after them down Drury-lane and John Williams stopped Ragan—Mara was not taken till the next Saturday night and I did not see him till about ten days after because I was out of town—I then walked into the waiting-room at Bow-street station-house and picked him out of I should say twenty or twenty-five people—I recognized him the moment I saw him Cross-examined by MR O BRINE Q Then the persons who embraced your brother did not run away immediately A They did not stand a minute after they left him—they remained there till I said You have lost your watch —that was not more than half a minute—I was standing speaking to my brother at the time this occurred—we were not than a yard apart—Isaw no women there—there might have been—I had been to see my brother and sister home—I had been with my brother all day—we took our meals as usual as we did every day—we had a little drink—we had no brandy or rum—I never drink rum—there was no rum taken by any of the company to my knowledge—we had some porter—I dare say I might have had a glass of gin—I cannot be certain whether I had or not—I had never seen Ragan before to my knowledge—I should say I had been in three public-houses in the course of the evening—my brother was with me all the time—we had nothing to drink but our tea before we went out—no rum nothing but beer—I had gone into two public-houses between the time of parting with my brother and sister and this occurrence—both houses were in Drury-lane Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q You always recollected that there were three persons and that they stood forty yards apart A I did not say they stood forty yards apart—I said it might be two or three—they stepped away two or three yards till I spoke to my brother—I saw Ragan go in front of my brother and hold him round the neck with both his arms and then saw Mara go and put his arms and hands round my brother—he then suddenly ran away—Ragan then suddenly let go and ran away also—they did stand two or three yards off till I spoke to my brother—this is my signature to my depositions— read— I saw Ragan go in front of my brother and hold him around his neck with both his arms while he was so holding him I saw Mara go behind my brother and put his arms and hands round my brother and then leaving him suddenly he ran away on Ragan leaving go his hold he also ran away I then observed my brother s watch-guard &c —Ihad seen several policemen before I went into the lobby to identify Mara—they did not tell me I should find him there—they told me there was a whole lot sitting in the room and I must go in and see if the man was there—what I said before the Magistrate is correct Q What do you mean now by saying there were three persons and that they did not run away till you had spoken to your brother about his watch A I told the same tale then that I have now or something very near it—I told the Magistrate I caught hold of Ragan s shoulder MR PARRY Q Are you quite sure you told the Magistrate substantially the same story as you have told to-day A I did—I cannot say as to the same words—I mentioned that there were three men—I was as sober that evening as I am now—my brother might have had a little drink COURT Q Who did the party consist of at your brother s house A Myself my two brothers my brother s wife and two of my friends—we had tea and bread-and-butter with it—we had sugar and cream in our tea—the ladies had no rum in their tea JOHN WILLIAMS I am

the cap off my head and chucked it at another person who chucked it back again—he went up a court—I followed him all the way and did not lose sight of him till the policeman took him—I do not speak to

them at all till this occurrence—I had taken tea with them—their other brother was there and Mr Sneed s sister-in-law and a young child—we had no spirits with our tea—I had had a drop of gin before my tea and I might have bad some beer after it—I had had some rum from the public-house in the afternoon about one o clock—I was sober—I had not been into a great many public-house—Icannot say whether it

Williams—it was in consequence of that that I apprehended him—I knew both the prisoners very well and have seen them together more than once Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did not Mara come up to you A Yes he did—the Magistrate let him go on the Monday on his own recognizances to come up again and he did so—I believe William and Thomas Sneed saw him on the Monday but the brother did not—he was in

Prosecution JOHN RAILEY I am a seafaring man On Saturday morning the 1st of May I left my lodgings about half-past eleven o clock and went down Pennington-street and was told there was a procession of charity children expected in Gravel-lane—I walked with them as far as the church door in St George s-in-the-East—I saw them go into the church-gates—there was a great crowd—after they got into the gates I was going home and making my way through the crowd I saw a man who was the prisoner Phillips coming towards me in great haste and the prisoner Tedgell following him—Phillips came right against me in front pressed very hard against my waistcoat-pocket where my watch was—at the same time I heard a snap and felt my watch go from me—the guard was round my neck—that was not broken but the watch was broken from the guard—I felt the snatch which broke it from the guard and saw it in Phillips hand—I directly seized him and called the police but no policeman coming near I had to struggle with him for ten minutes—not a single policeman came up for ten minutes—at the time I saw the watch in Phillips hand I saw the prisoner Campbell on my left-hand side and Tedgdll on my right rather before me—this was while I was struggling—Campbell had hold of Phillips arm trying to rescue him from me—Tedgell struck me on the arm several times—Campbell attempted to make a blow at my head and knocked off Phillips hat—Campbell said You have got hold of the wrong man he is a gentleman —there were a number of them about me at the time—I cannot identify either of the other prisoners but they were striking me in all directions—Phillips s waistcoat tore and he got away from me—I followed him down Cannon-street across the highway and never lost sight of him till he was stopped—my watch was found on the spot where the struggle took place—the watch produced is it—it was found with the glass broken Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q There was a great crowd A Yes—there was no shuffling or bustling till Phillips came up—I was on the pavement—the children were in the road—I was at the last part of the children and there was not a great crowd there—there was in the street—the officers made way for them but did not make any confusion—everything went off very quietly—there was no crowd where I stood—a woman stood next to me with two children—I was not pushed backwards and forwards in the least till this happened I was in a very comfortable spot—nobody was pushed against me—this was done suddenly—I swear Phillips was not pushed against me—Tedgell was behind him he pushed him—there was nobody else behind him at the time—I was making my way out of the crowd and Phillips came right across me in a great hurry and the moment he came to me I felt the pressure against my waistcoat-pocket and heard the snap—I was looking directly in his face—I saw him coming towards me—I did not turn rounds to see Phillips—he was right before me—I looked at my waistcoat pocket and saw the watch in his hand—I took hold of him before he had time to put it in his pocket COURT Q Had you ever seen Tedgell before A No—he was probably about ten minutes near me—I saw his face and am certain he is the man Cross-examined by MR WILD Q Have you seen the policeman since this A I have seen him almost every day here and at the Police-court and walked with him after the trials were over and had a glass of ale with him—I went to his house one day to ask about my watch about a week ago—I only went once—I did not stop above ten minutes and did not drink anything—I asked him what time I should have attend in the morning and asked to took at my watch to see if it was injured—that was my only motive in going—he said nothing about this trial—I had about ten minutes struggle with Phillips not previous to the

search my pockets—I parted with it under the dread of transportation—he took it—I did not make any attempt to get it back MR O BRINE contended that the 1st count charging a robbery at common law could not be supported by this evidence which only amounted to a threat to charge an infamous crime see The Queen v Henry and Taunton 2 Moody s Crown Cases 118 and that the 4th count was defective the words

money out of fear—they threatened to punch my head if I did not—I went straight towards Battersea-bridge met a policeman and returned with him to the spot—we saw the prisoner Green in the Old-House-at-Home public-house in the field but I did not speak to her—I had not taken any sort of liberty with the girl or anybody else Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q This was somewhere about nine o clock A About twenty minutes to nine o clock—it was about a quarter to nine o clock when I met the policeman and that was about five minutes after this matter happened—it was dusk getting dark—it was a moonlight night—there are no gas-lights in Battersea-fields—I saw Simpson on the Sunday following the next day in the field—I did not give him into custody the policeman was too far behind and he made his escape—I was in search of him with the policeman—I saw him in the field putting stumps down in the booth—he walked very fast and I missed him while I was looking after the policeman—I saw him again on the 2nd of Sept when he was taken into custody—I was taken to the station by a policeman to see him—he was pointed out to me—I was not at all drunk on the night in question COURT Q How far was Simpson from you when you saw him in the field on the Sunday A Within a yard or two—there is a fair held there on Sundays—I saw him scarcely for a minute—he went into the booth and out at the other end—he saw me and appeared to know me—he coloured is the face and while I was making a sign to the policeman he disappeared—I am quite sure he saw me—the policeman was about 100 yards behind me coming across the field—I communicated this to the policeman as soon as I got up to him Green How can you say he was putting stumps in the booth when I was down there on the very same Sunday evening and he had cock-shy sticks in his hand Witness They were stumps—I did not see you in the field that day—I did not give you any money THOMAS BENT policeman V 95 I heard of this robbery on the Tuesday and looked for the prisoner Simpson—I saw him on Thursday the 2nd of Sept in the Wandsworth-road—I asked whether he did not go by the name of Swanney—he said he did—I said he was charged with robbing a man in Battersea-fields on the Saturday night week before—he said I was not them at all that night —I said I must take him to the station to see whether he was or not—I had known him before by the name of Thomas Simpson and by the nickname of Swanney Cross-examined Q Did he say I was not there that night I was not near the place A Yes JHON WALLIS policeman V 293 I was on duty in Battersa-foelds on the evening of the 21st of Aug and about five minutes before nine o clock met the prosecutor—he told me what had happened to him in consequence of which I went back with him—we saw the female prisoner but I did not speak to her or take her into custody then—I saw her again on the 3rd of Sept and took her into custody—I told her she was charged with being concerned in a robbery in Battersea-fields with Swanney Simpson—she said she knew nothing about Swanney Simpson—next day after coming out of the Magistrate s office she said there was only her and Simpson and the prosecutor there only them three—no one was putting questions to her at that time—she was in custody at the time—we were returning from the Magistrate s office—she said she wanted to give her evidence—I told her she had been asked twice whether she had anything to ask the witnesses and she had said as—she said she wished to tell the truth that there was only them three there that was Simpson her and the prosecutor Cross-examined Q Only three where A In Battersea-fields at the time of the robbery—I believe there was the word she used—I am sure that was the word— there at the time —I was only examined once before the Magistrate that was on the same day that Green was examined—what she said was on coming away from the examination—she had been remanded from the day before for her and Simpson to be brought up together COURT Q Were you before the Magistrate more than once A Yes—I was there after Green stated this to me—I made a mistake when I said I was only examined once before the Magistrate—I was examined twice—it was the second time that she said what I have stated Green I never said whether there were three or four persons Witness She did and the prosecutor heard her as well—she said she wished t tell the truth that there was only Simpson and her and the prosecutor there at the time—I swear she said that and she heard me state it to the Magistrate JOHN POTTER policeman V 118 On the night of the 21st of Aug I was on duty in Battersea-fields and saw Simpson there about a quarter-past eight o clock—I knew him and had seen him there the whole of the season—he has got cock-shies there—I have seen Green about there with a number of other persons stopping out there—there is a kind of fair there the whole of the summer with horse-riding swings target-shooting with nuts and all that kind of thing WILLIAM JOHNSON I keep a coffee-stall in Battersea-fields I know the prisoners by sight but nothing more—I have not been there long—I begun to keep the stall about two months ago and have seen them in my stall every day for the last two months sometimes apart and sometimes together Cross-examined Q Have you seen Green with other men A No not unless they were in company together—I have not seen Simpson with other people—I never noticed him except in her company—if she came for any refreshment when he was down in field she had it and went away—sometimes they both came together COURT Q You have seen a good many other people in these fields during the two months A Yes hundreds of the same rank in life—it was nothing particular to see him there on the 21st of Aug more than any one else—I was at home no board my barge in the dock in Battersea-fields on Saturday night at nine o clock—I did not know anything about this till Monday MR RYLAND Q What time did you give up business in your stall A About nine o clock—the stall is in the barge—I live there ALFRED LAINSON re-examined I was in the girl s company about a minute and a half or two minutes—I did not look at her before she spoke to me or look round at her as I passed—I was turning my head round and was just about walking on when the boy came up to me—he was crying very bitterly which attracted my attention—when he ran away she ran away too and the men ran towards me—I had not much opportunity of looking at her face but I knew her again directly I saw her—I had never seen her before—I saw her again the same evening—it was all done in three four or five minutes—the male prisoner whistled almost directly he came up—he stood facing me in a fighting attitude—the moon was shining and I could distinguish his countenance well—I had seen him as I was crossing the field in the early part of the evening in company with another man and recollected having seen him before that day—I am quite satisfied he is the same person THOMAS BENT re-examined I was before the Magistrate on the 8th when the prisoners made a statement—they were asked severally whether they had anything to say—Green made a statement which was taken down and read over to her—she made her mark and the Magistrate signed it—I know his writing—Simpson also made a short statement which was witnessed by the Magistrate Cross-examined Q Did you hear Wallis examined A Yes on the 4th—I apprehended Green on the 3rd—to the best of my belief he went through the whole of his examination again on the 8th—I might not have been there the whole of the day—I gave no evidence that day—I have no doubt I was there the whole of the time—I was there at the time the deposition were read—I do not think I left the Court at all—I believe I went out once with the male prisoner—the examination was not going on then—I do not think I was called out of Court—I heard Wallis make his statement—he gave the whole of his evidence on the 8th—I do not remember what evidence he gave—the prisoners were told that they might say what they liked but what they said would be taken down and used against or for them at the trial—Mr Beadon was the Magistrate—I have seen him write many times for two or three months—I stood close to him and saw him write this—I know the character of his writing—I have seen him sign my recognisance papers—I should say this is not his writing looking at a paper —I will not swear to it—I have not seen him write like that—I have a doubt about this being his writing—he sometimes writes similar to this but not like this—he writes William Frederic Beadon but not with a lot of dashes under it— The prisoners statements were here read— The prisoner Green says On last Saturday fortnight between seven and eight o clock the gentleman met me and asked me how I did and asked me to take his arm—he went with me to the Red House and treated me—we went across the fields—he said he had taken a fancy to me and he would be a good friend to me but he was rather short of cash that night that he had only 3s 6d in his waistcoat pocket—he gave me 3s and said he would keep the 6d as we should want a glass of brandy-and-water—he took me across the bank and began taking indecent liberties with me—I would not let him—he wanted me to give him the money back—I said it was a gift but I would go to a house with him—he said he would knock me down if I did not let him do as he liked—I said If you do I shall get somebody to do it for you —he struck me on the shoulder—I called out and Simpson ran from the booth—I told him and he told the gentleman he had better go on about his business and he went on—I went on and saw the prosecutor fall down over the bank—I went to the Old House-at-Home and treated Simpson for his protection—I asked him to see me across the fields—he saw me as far as the Duchess public-house and left me—I saw the gentleman on the Tuesday after and because I would not let him go with me he said he would punish me and the man too—The prisoner Simpson says What she has said is true he never gave me any money Thomas Holden plumber of New Compton-street Soho gave Simpson a good

the Prosecution JOHN ARCHER I am a servant at 63 Lower Sloane-street Chelsea On the night of 11th July about twenty minutes past eleven o clock I was in Sloane-street and saw the two female prisoners there—they acosted me—one came on my right and the other on my left side—they invited me to come along with them—I declined and told them to go about their business—they would not—Pickett who was on my left snatched at my watch and dragged my silver chain gold seal and common key from my watch—the guard which is now round my neck saved it—she flew into the road—I immediately bolted after her—she up with her fist and knocked my hat off and I received a tremendous blow at the side of my head—I stooped to pick up my hat and as I rose I received another tremendous blow at the side of my head—the prisoner Keates then came up and said Did you strike that woman —I said Yes —her shawl fell off he picked it up and said Do you mean to strike her —I said Yes —she ran as hard as she could down the street calling out I will follow you home —I said Do you mean to keep that shawl —he said Yes —I said I will thank you to give it to me till I get my property back —he said No —he took it and gave it to Tapson who was on the pavement—she said I know who that shawl belongs to —I said You shall give it to me —she said No I shall keep it —they walked on down Sloane-street and I followed them and insisted on having my property or the shawl—there were two more bullies on the pavement—at the corner of Exceter-street a policeman came up and I gave Tapson in custody—I did not charge Keates then Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Had you a stick in your hand A Yes I raised it up when the man said Are you going to strike the woman and I said Yes if you dare to strike me again —that was when I received the second blow—that was the first time I saw Keates—Keates did not go to the station-house with us—I did not observe him—I will not swear he did not—I lost sight of him to the best of my recollection in crossing the King s-road going to the station-house—he was present when I gave Tapson in charge—I saw him next morning with Pickett near the station-house and gave him in charge COURT Q Did the blow Pickett gave you knock you down A No I was not knocked down with either blow—I can take my oath of Tapson—she kept following me down Sloane-street—I can swear to them both WILLIAM WARDLOW policeman B 87 On 11th June about a quarter to twelve I was in Sloane-street Chelsea and saw the prosecutor there and a number of persons with him—Tapson and Keates were with him—the prosecutor who was following Tapson said he would follow them till he found a policeman that they had robbed him of a chain and seal—I told him I was a policeman—I was in plain clothes and he then gave Tapson in custody and charged her with robbing him—I took her to the station-house—she had this shawl produced in her possession—she said she knew the female who had robbed him but she did not know her name or where she lived—I was present the next morning when the prosecutor recognised the other prisoners and charged them—when Keates was charged he said Tapson was passing along—he knew nothing about it and she picked up the shawl Cross-examined Q Keates was there when you came up A Yes he went down towards the station-house after Tapson was given in custody—going along he spoke to the prosecutor and induced him to let him go JOHN ARCHER re-examined This is the shawl that dropped from Pickett s lack when she robbed me—the seal and chain have not been found—I did not raise my stick until Keates came before me and asked if I was going to strike the woman—he did not say What you are not going to strike a female are you —I told him I would strike him if he dared to lift his hand against me—I had not my arm raised to strike the female when he came up Tapson s Defence If I had been guilty I should not have stood there holding the shawl if I had given him the shawl he would not have given me in custody I was looking for a policeman and I meant to give the shawl to him in the prosecutor s presence Keates was coming down to the station to say he saw me pick it up I knew the female a long time Pickett s Defence I was not in Sloane-street at all that night the shawl does not belong to me I have had only one for the last twelvemonths I came to the station-house next morning to take a summons cut I walked up and down the street the prosecutor came up to me and said he had something belonging to me I asked what it was and he said he would tell me by-and-by I was then taken and accused of the robbery I had nothing to do with it Witness for the Defence WILLIAM FRANCIS PLUMMER On 11th July last as I was proceeding home in Sloane-street I saw a scuffle a few yards before me between a woman and the prosecutor—they were standing up—the woman was apparently beating him—she knocked off his hat and immediately ran away—the prosecutor stooped to pick his hat up and ran after her towards the top of Sloane-street—I did not see anything happen to him while he was stooping—the woman ran away while he was picking up his hat—there was another woman there and she ran after her across the road—there was a third woman coming down Sloane-street who picked up the shawl—the prosecutor turned back and asked her where she was going to take the shawl to and asked her to give it him—she said she would not give it to him she would give it to a policeman—she proceeded towards Exeter-street—he followed her —the policeman came up and he gave her in custody—she was four or five yards from the prosecutor when I first saw her and was coming in quite a different direction to the woman who ran away—I did not know her before—I follwed her to the station—I li ml the prosecutor give her in charge—I herd him ask her it she knew were the girl was that had taken his chain and she said she knew nothing of it—he did not give her in charge for being concerned in stealing the chain—he said You know the girl that has stolen my chain give it up and I will say no more about it —I was not allowed to go into the station to state what I knew or I should have done so but I told the policeman in going towards the station that I saw the girl pick it up—I gave my address that night and Tapson s sister came to me and asked me to come and state with I knew—I knew them by sight before but never had any conversation with them—the girl who ran away was stouter than Tapson much about the same height but a stiffer made girl and the second one that ran away appeared about the same height—I did not see their faces—I saw Keates when I got to Exeter-street—he was not there when the prosecutor s hat was knocked off—I am a carpenter and work for Mr Hastings at Knightsbridge—I saw the prosecutor raise his stick to defend himself from the girl who ran away WILLIAM WARDLOW re examined The prosecutor gave Tapson in charge to me for being concerned with the other in robbing him of his chain seal and key—I saw Plummer that night—it was a clear night—I can t say whether there was a moon but the lamps are thick in Sloane-street and show a very good light so that I could see a man s countenance perfectly well JOHN ARCHER re-examined It was a fine night—not moonlight—the stars were shining—there was plenty of light to distinguish a person s face—I am quite sure Pickett is the person who stole my chain—as soon as she saw me next morning she ran away as hard as she could—I and two policemen ran after her 200 or 300 yards—Keates who was with her bolted as well and the policeman took him—I did not give him in charge the night the robber was committed ROBERT BANBERICK On the night of this robbery I was at the Free Traders Arms Exeter-street till eleven o clock when the house closed—I came out with the landlord and two or three others and went into the Prince of Wales an adjoining house and had a pot of beer—we were there about half an hour—Keates was with me and had been with me at the Free Traders—we came out of the Prince of Wales together and while standing there I saw a disturbance at the top of Exeter-street—Keates said I wonder what that is —he waited two or three minutes and men said I will go and see what that disturbance is about —he ran away—I followed him—when I got there I saw the prosecutor flourishing a stick in his hand and rolling his eyes about as if he was mad or intoxicated—he was saying I will knock down any person that hits or comes near me —I saw a female running away and it was towards her that he raised his stick—I saw Tapson there with a shawl in her hand—I did not see her pick it up—she did not attempt to go away—the prosecutor asked her tor the shawl—she refused to give it up—the policeman came up and he gave her in charge for having possession of the shawl—he said he would either hive the shawl or his property—that he had been robbed of a chain or something of that description—Keates I and several others followed to the station to state what we had seen—a man named Carey went in—Keates would also have gone but I said he had better not as Carey would be sufficient—Carey was not one of our party but was a perfect stranger—keates remained outside till the prosecutor came out—I then bid him good night and went home—I am a carpenter and joiner—I am in work and was so at that time—I have known Keates six months by having drunk together but have no particular acquaintance with him—I do not know how he gets his living MR EWART Q How far is the Prince of Wales from the corner of Stone-street A 100 or 150 yards—when Keates went to see what the row was I followed close at his heels—he was not above five yards before me—he was not in company with any female by the prosecutor—he walked within a

he had lost his hat in a scuffle with a brewer then he said he had been in a row with Mr Preston about this watch and asked me to go and see for his hat I went and met Preston and the policeman with the hat in his hand I thought it might be Doyle s hat but I did not like to ask for it for fear it should not the policeman asked Preston if I was one he looked at me and said it was a taller man than me I followed them down to some old houses and then went in-doors Doyle knows the same and he knows I was not there EDWARD PRESTON re-examined Nowlan asked if he was a taller man than me that meant Doyle and I said Doyle was taller than me—it was not Mulloy for I never saw him—I did not see him in Orchard-street WILLIAM NOWLAN re-examined I saw Mulloy in Orchard-street—I did not ask Preston if he was one of them—I was asking him about Doyle at the time—he did not point to Mulloy and say He was a taller man than you —Mulloy was five or six yards behind me and had a short pipe in his mouth

was lying in Jones s bed when the constable entered the room and if 1 bad been in trouble why did not he take me then I never saw the prosecutor in my life I did live in the same bouse but not in the same room when the prosecutor was at the station-house he only said I think I know you MARK LOOME re-examined I was at the house three days after the robbery and saw Flynn but I knew if I took her the other would escape so I let her alone till I could find them both together—they made their escape from that room the same morning—I know that the male prisoners are in the habit of associating with the females—they are all associates together—I believe Mulloy has not been about Westminster more than a month—I have seen him in company with Doyle and Haycock also—Haycock cohabits with a woman who lives in the first-floor front-room in that house Haycock I did live in that street but had left and went to White Horse-street I was in Westminster that night I have seen the other prisoners but do not associate with them EDWARD PRESTON re-examined I am certain that Flynn returned into the room with Mulloy after I sent her out for the gin—the gin never came—there was not time for her to have

BATES I live at 48 Howland-street Fitzroy-square and am a printer On the morning of 16th Jan about twenty minutes to one o clock I was coming over Hungerford-bridge from the Surrey-side—I had taken a glass of rum and water a drop of porter and a cigar but I was perfectly collected and knew what I was about—I had not got more than fifty yards from the toll-bar when the prisoner Flood accosted me and walked a few steps by me and then pressed me so tight against the wall that I was unable to extricate myself—I did not see Smart then—when I rescued myself a little from her hold she gave me a violent blow in my face which sent me right across the bridge with great force and knocked me down—I was stunned for a few minutes and immediately afterwards Smart made his appearance raised me up wiped my face and accused me of taking improper liberties—I was unable at the time to make any defence—I know nothing more till the officer came up—I told him I had lost my watch which I had safe in my pocket three minutes before I went on to the bridge Cross-examined by MR METCALFE Q Where had you been to A I had been spending an hour or two with Mr Day a publican and a few friends in Cross-street Blackfriars-road—I went at about a quarter-past nine o clock—we did not have anything to drink till half-past ten—I accompanied some of my relations part of the way home and left them to come over Hungerford-bridge—I had nothing at all to drink before I went to Mr Day s—I left home at half-past eight—I remained at the station all that night—I was bleeding from my face and they did not think it safe to let me go as I lived at such a distance—they would not let me go without bail—there was no charge made against me that I am aware of—I was not charged with being drunk—I did not hear it—I was not doing anything with Flood while she was pressing me against the wall—we were standing face to face I against the wall and she facing me—she came in a direction towards me meeting me—I saw no other woman—I was sent against the wall when she knocked me down—she ran away immediately—she struck me directly I liberated myself Cross-examined by MR BALLANTIHE Q What were the words Smart used A He raised me up a little and said You have been taking some improper liberties —he did not ask me whether I had been taking improper liberties he might have said I suppose you have CHARLES BOTTOM I am a waiter and live in Granby-place Lower Marsh Lambeth—I was passing over Hungerford-bridge on this morning at twenty minutes to one o clock and saw Bates with his back against the side of the bridge and Flood close to him apparently pressing him—I was about eight yards from them—I was going towards the Surrey-side and had not arrived at where they were—I thought them not in a proper position and crossed to the other side meaning to pass them unnoticed—when I had passed them about three yards I heard a sort of blow I instantly turned round and saw Bates in the act of falling—at the same time I saw a man who I had not seen before come from the recess on the left—he was in the act of rising when I first saw him—the woman rushed past me to make her escape to the Surrey-side—I called out Police and Murder till I saw the toll-man come out of his box and saw the shine of a policeman s hat in the centre of the bridge—the woman was taken on the bridge—I had lost sight of her for more than a moment when I turned my head—I did not see her face when I first saw her with the man—when I advanced I kept her in sight constantly crying out Police and Murder and she was stopped—about eight yards before she got to the gate I saw her hand in a raised position—I accompanied the policeman to where Bates was—Smart was there then apparently supporting him—I swear positively he is the same man I saw rise from the recess—I accused Flood of knocking Bates down and said That is the man that came from the corner putting my hand on Smart—he instantly began to bounce me about with a sort of domineer or threat and said No you must be mistaken —I said I am positive you are the man but from his continuing to bully me I began to be fearful I might be mistaken—the woman immediately said Do you mean to say I am the woman who knocked the man down —I said Yes I swear it and clapped my hand on her shoulder—she immediately gave me a desperate blow in the eye which nearly sent me over—I continued to call out Murder and Police —I rushed down to the toll-house and begged the toll-man to spring his rattle—a policeman was there at the time and had charge of Flood—I met two people and begged them to go to the policeman s assistance—the prosecutor was then bleeding but I was in too excited a state to think about him—next morning he appeared in a dreadful state—I never saw a man so dreadfully beaten about—his eyebrow was cut and there was a hole or cut in the forehead and one under the eye which I think must have been done with some instrument—I pointed out to Bradley the policeman the place where Flood raised her arm—I should say that is nearly a hundred yards from where I first saw Bates and Flood Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Was there not a gentleman at the station-house who you pointed out as the person that came from the recess A No I am positive of that—there was a man there—I said to the policeman Take notice of that man for he very much resembles a person who attacked me at the toll-house —I was not referring to the man who was with Flood—he was a tall thinfaced man he promised to attend but he did not JAMES BRADLEY policeman L 42 I was on duty in Belvedere-road—heard a cry of Police —I went on to the bridge and saw Flood run down—when she got about fifty yards from where I found the prosecutor she slackened her pace and came on—I stopped her when she had come about six yards farther and took her back to where I found the prosecutor—he had two coats on—I unbuttoned them and perceived the chain of a watch hanging the watch was gone—Bottom pointed out Smart and said That is the man that rushed from there pointing to the recess I am sure it was you —he said How dare you say so and Bottom then said Well I don t think it was —I then took the prosecutor and Flood to the station—I said Mr Smart it is just the turn you are likely to be guilty of — I knew him by name —it is better for you at any rate to come down to the station—he came about halfway and then I was told he went off—I saw no more of him—I have been looking for him ever since—I searched the bridge and the wharf adjoining which is in the direction which Flood came and on the wharf I found this watch produced —it was going the face was open it was two hours afterwards Cross-examined by MR METCALPB Q How far was it from where you found the prosecutor A Fifty yards—the prosecutor s guard had the appearance of having been broken Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Was there a tall person at the station A There was—Bottom pointed him out as the person who interfered with him at the toll-bar—I did not hear Smart say Good night before he went away—I looked back for him and could not see him JAMES JENNINGS policeman A 316 I know Flood and Smart—I aaw them both at half-past twelve o clock on 16th Jan come down the right side of Hungerford-market towards the bridge—they were talking to one another—when they got within ten yards of the toll-gate I saw Smart leave Flood and go in advance till he got twelve or fourteen yards on to the bridge—he then made a stop till Flood came up and they both went on together JAMES STUBBINS I am toll-collector on the Middlesex-side of Hunger-ford-bridge On this evening about half-past twelve o clock as near as possible I saw Smart come up he paid and passed through and immediately after Flood came paid and passed through—Jennings was standing opposite to me and when Smart passed through I pointed to him knowing him—no one passed through beside them for a minute or two before or after JESSE CANNON policeman L 69 I was on duty on Hungerford-bridge and saw both prisoners about three yards apart almost on the Surrey-side of the bridge—they were seven or eight yards from the recess—I knew

charge of being concerned with Mary Ann Flood now in custody for assaulting and robbing a man on Hungerford Suspension-bridge on the morning of 16th —he said I should like to know who it was that put you on to me —he said he supposed it was Sergeant Goff—I said it was from information I had received—he said So help me God Almighty I know nothing of it EDWARD BATES re-examined This is my watch and the one that was taken from me that night Cross-examined by MR METCALFE Q Was the chain broken A I do not know whether it was cut or broken FLOOD— GUILTY Aged 19 SMART— GUILTY Aged 20 Transported for

when I got out it was light—I had no idea where I was—as soon as I came to my senses I hallooed out and went towards the door—I found a small key on the floor—I heard footsteps outside pushed the key under the door and it was opened by a pot-boy—I found I was in the back-room first-floor—I partly went downstairs and then went upstairs to a back-room and found a man and woman there—I sent an envelope by the man to my father s office and they came in a cab for me—these are the trowsers I had on—they are muddy up to the knees as if I had been dragged along the mud—they were not so before—this hat and boots are mine—my memory was very much affected at the police-court—I am better now but am confused and cannot recollect very well—I had been very ill with the jaundice this was only the fourth day I had been out—I had suffered no loss of intellect before this—the house where I found myself is about two hundred yards from where my recollection serves me last—there is a street between—Osborne-street turns out of Whitechapel and Thrall-street out of that—I had not spoken to any females and have not the slightest knowledge of the prisoners—I had been ill for a month JOHN DOWARD I am potman at the Frying-pan Brick-lane—Thrall-street runs out of Brick-lane the second turning from Whitechapel-church On 11th Jan between ten and eleven in the morning I went to 8 Thrall-street to collect pots and heard the back-room door first-floor rattle—there was padlock on it—I saw a key outside opened it and found Mr Jewitt—he made a complaint to me—he looked very bad—I told a policeman WILLIAM SAUNDERS I am a painter and live in the top room back of 8 Thrall-street the floor above where Mr Jewitt was He came up to me that morning and I took his father s address on an envelope I brought back one of the clerks in a cab and then took the prosecutor into the cab on my back—he was in very great agitation and seemed to be lost in thought—he said he had been trepanned and robbed—on the night previous I went to bed about half-past ten o clock—I heard a noise two or three times between three and four in the morning in the room below where the prisoner Higgins lived—she was there the day before—it was a faint sort of a groan as if some one was in the night-mare—being tired I went off to sleep again DAVID EVANS I am pot-boy to Mr Harley sometimes when I can get a day s work there On 11th Jan about twelve o clock I went for a pot to the back-room first-floor of 8 Thrall-street—Higgins lives there and I have seen Smith there but not in company with Higgins—I looked under the bed and found a hat and a pair of boots—there was a lot of spue and vomit there—I lifted the sheet out of the mess and opened the window GEORGE COX policeman 138 H On Thursday night 10th Jan I was on duty and had to pass 8 Thrall-street—I know that the prisoners lived there in the back-room first-floor—I have had the room pointed out to me—it was where Mr Jewitt was found—I saw the prisoners together about half-past ten o clock that night and saw them go into the house—I saw them together again about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve—Smith said You b—r I will lag you —Higgins said You go on I will be along with you directly —lag means transport—Smith goes by the name of Fat Bet Smith Q You said before it was half-past eleven o clock when you saw me A I never said so—I followed you through Thrall-street George-street Wentworth-street and Commercial-street into Whitechapel and saw Higgins speak to a man named Gallagher—I did not say at Worship-street that I did not know who the man was COURT Q About how long should you say they were in the house A About two hours—there are a good number of foot-passengers in Thrall-street between nine and ten o clock but there is a court-way that they could use where there is scarcely any one passing they might meet some girls but no respectable people—the court is inhabited by those sort of characters—a person apparently drunk would not attract much attention THOMAS KELLY police-sergeant H 2 I took Higgins in Keate-street Spitalfields about half-past ten o clock on 12th Jan —I told her she was charged with drugging and robbing a gentleman at 8 Thrall-street—she said I did not do it Fat Bet brought him to my room she robbed him of him things cut with and stuck to the regulars meaning that she kept the money God strike me blind if I get lagged any more than the other as one was as much in it as the other and if you go to Hart s house in George-street you will find her there to-night or at Irish Mog s that is the girl of the town who lives next door but you must not tell that I told you or they will kill me when I come out —I took her to the station—she said Fat Bet did not give her anything—I went to Hart s house and the home next door but could not find Smith Higgins I said the key was always left in the door Witness Yes for the accommodation of Fat Bet but I did not know you meant Smith JOHN JOHNS policeman H 76 On 10th Jan I was on duty in Osborne-place and saw the prisoners walking together about half-past nine o clock about forty yards from High-street and 200 yards from Thrall-street—I saw them again about half-past eleven in Thrall-street—on the Saturday night afterwards about half-past twelve I and another officer went to a house in George-street about twenty yards from Thrall-street—I went to the back-door and my brother officer to the front—I heard a knock at the front door and a male voice said So help me God Bill it is the copper hook it —cooper means policeman and hook it make your escape—the back-door was opened from the inside and Smith came out partly undressed—I knew her before by the name of Fat Bet—she tried to escape from the passage—I stopped her and said I took her for drugging and robbing a gentleman in Thrall-street—she said You are mistaken it was not me it was the other —I said What other —she made no answer ANN HURLEY I am the wife of Patrick Hurley who keeps a beer-shop at 18 Thrall-street—No 8 Thrall-street belongs to me On 11th Jan Higgins lived in the back room first floor and Smith with her—on 11th Jan a short time after the prosecutor went away in the cab Higgins came to the bar—Gallagher was there—he had lived with me—I know that he had been in the hospital—Higgins and he had a pint of ale together—Higgins paid for it—I heard her say she sold the watch for 1l and the ring for 3s and she gave Fat Bet 13s 6d out of it—Gallagher said something about lag but my child cried and I turned round—I came back and heard her say she sold the b—y scarf for 9d —next day I went to the room where the prisoners lodged and saw vomiting about it and a chamber utensil nearly full of vomit Higgins Q What state was I in A A little the worse for liquor not quite drunk CHRISTOPHER LERICK I am a surgeon of West Ham I attended Mr Jewitt for jaundice five weeks previous to this outrage—I have heard his account and believe his becoming insensible might have been occasioned by chloroform—from the state in which I found him I think laudanum was given him after the chloroform—a person could not become insensible by having laudanum put to his nose COURT Q Did you smell the vomit A He was not sick after I was called to him but was in a state of stupor and had a contracted pupil a bard pulse and giddiness —I believe the effects of chloroform go off speedily but I only know it from hospital reports—the state I found him in was not the effect of the jaundice but of some opiate—he had had one of the most serious attacks of jaundice I ever saw in a young person but it never brings on insensibility—I had seen him on the morning of the 10th—he was in such a state that his stomach was easily affected—claret was the only fluid I allowed him to take—he had no vomiting during his illness—it is not a symptom of the disease—an opiate would bring on copious vomiting seven or eight hours afterwards—he has been delirious for three days since this—that is not attributable to the jaundice Higgins Defence The key was always left in the door it is a common house several other girls live in it I never saw the gentleman and know nothing about it Smith s Defence The key was always in the door I never saw the gentleman HIGGINS— GUILTY Aged 23 SMITH— GUILTY Aged 22 of Robbery Transported for

t18500408-868  868 JANE KNIGHT was indicted for a robbery with violence with two other persons on Charles John Cowell and stealing 3 sovereigns and 1 half-sovereign his moneys MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution CHARLES JOHN COWELL I am a clerk in the employ of a Custom-house agent and live at 57 Queen s-row Walworth On Monday night 1st April about nine o clock or a little before I was in the Albany-road—I had come from the Old Kent-road—I had occasion to turn down the first turning on the right for a necessary purpose and while I was there the prisoner came up to me and asked what I was going to stand—I said I was not going to stand anything—she laid hold of my right arm—I told her to leave go—she then laid hold of me round the neck with both bands—I made an effort to get away from her but was not able to do so—two men came up at the same time and one of them said Halloo old girl you are drunk why don t you leave the gentleman alone —I thought they were going to disengage her arms from my neck but I felt one of the men put a handkerchief or cloth round my mouth—it had a very disagreeable smell of something I could not say what—I then suspected their intention was to rob me and I struggled and struck some one but I do not know who it was—I had on an oil-skin cap and the point of it covered my eyes over so that I could not see—it was pushed down at the time by some one s hand I suppose—the handkerchief or cloth covered my mouth and nostrils—after I had struggled and struck somebody I received a blow at the lower part of my stomach and after that I do not remember anything—I became insensible—I had three sovereigns and a half in my waistcoat pocket—when I recovered myself I was lying down on the right-hand path and my money was gone—no one was near me then—no one could have taken my money before I met the prisoner—I am quite sure I had it safe when the prisoner came up to me—I noticed her dress—she bad on a dark dress a dark shawl and a black bonnet—I noticed her features and her voice too—I have heard her speak since she has been in custody and I knew her voice again as well as the face Prisoner Q Can you take your oath that it was I that did it A Yes—I mentioned before the Magistrate about receiving the blow in the stomach—a man was taken up but I could not identify him JURY Q How long do you suppose it was before you came to yourself A I suppose about ten minutes as near as I can say COURT Q When you went down this turning do you know what time it was A Not exactly I think it was about ten minutes to nine—it was eight o clock when I left my own house and I walked from there to the Elephant then down the Kent-road and into the Albany-road that would not take more than an hour and I did not hear any clock strike—when I got home it was about half-past nine—it took me rather longer to get home than it would have done if I had been well—I usually walk that distance in a quarter of an hour but it took me half an hour on this occasion GEORGE QUINNEAR police-sergeant P 1 On the night of 1st April I was on duty with Moss in the Old Kent-road about a quarter-past eight o clock and saw the prisoner there—I have known her by sight for several years—she was in the company of two men going in the direction for the Albany-road—she was dressed in a black bonnet and a dark shawl—her drew I cannot speak positively to—I produce a black velvet bonnet which was given up by the person who removed her things from where she lodged—I showed it to the prisoner at the police-court and she said That is my bonnet —when the prosecutor came to the station to see her she was placed with four other women and he selected her out—he could not identify the man—I could not positively swear to the man but I have an idea of who he is Prisoner Q You have known me down the Kent-road for several years A Yes for three years at least—I have seen you frequently in company with men there—I have several times seen two men following you—I have seen you in custody on several occasions for disorderly conduct—I never knew you in custody for robbery or stealing or anything of that sort RICHARD MOSS policeman P 330 I was with Quinnear on the night of 1st April about a quarter-past eight o clock and saw the prisoner and two men with her—they went along the Kent-road towards the end of the Albany-road —she had on a black bonnet—I took her into custody the next night—I told her that I took her for robbing a gentleman of three sovereigns and a half in the Albany-road with two men on the Monday night between eight and nine o clock—she said she was not near the place—I said How can you say that when I and serjeant Quinnear saw you go through the gate between tight and nine — I have known her a long time as a common prostitute I am sure it was her —she said it was not her she knew nothing at all about it she went away along with a man to a public-house drinking Prisoner You did not take me into custody Witness Indeed I did—I can swear that you had this bonnet on on Monday night and when I took you you had a new one on a straw one—you had on a black bonnet on Monday—I cannot swear it was this one—I found 6d on you Prisoner s Defence I am a poor unfortunate girl I have walked down that road three years and have never been in custody and never done anything that I was ashamed of on Easter Monday I had on this very light shawl that I have now and a new straw bonnet which I had put on for Easter it was not me I was certainly down there about a quarter-past eight o clock and left in company with a young woman and two young men—I mentioned the public-house I was in that night if they had liked to have got evidence—it was not me there is not a shopkeeper about there who can say I ever did wrong though I am unfortunate I never did such a thing in my life and never had two men follow me RICHARD MOSS re-examined The men I saw her with were not men that she met—they first walked past me and Quinnear—they did not appear to be men that had picked her up in the street—they were not very well dressed—they were walking in that sort of manner that I presumed they were persons she was well known to—I cannot say that I had ever seen either of them in company with her before—being fair night there was a great number of persons about and we were watching—I have seen the prisoner about almost every night for some years GEORGE QUINNEAR re-examined From the appearance of one of the men I think I have seen him several times in her company—I did not see his face I mean by his dress and height—from his general appearance I have no doubt it was a man named Thomas Stevens who I have seen in her company I should say a dozen times JURY Q When you searched her place was a dark shawl found belonging to her A The whole of her things were removed out of the place she occupied by a person who knew her and that person gave me up a duplicate of a dark plaid shawl that was pledged on the Wednesday morning—I have not got any dark shawl here Prisoner He took the prosecutor to see the shawl and he could not identify it I pledged it because I had no money and nothing to eat JURY Q Had you any particular reason for watching the prisoner that night A I should have watched her but I was coming in an opposite direction and had another object in view GUILTY Aged 21 — Transported for Fifteen Years Before Mr

JOHN BASS I am a superannuated inspector and live in Park-place On 3rd May I was in Clapham-park—the prisoners followed me a considerable distance—there were gas-lamps and I could see their faces—Leonard came up to me on the right side caught me by the arm with her left-hand and asked me how I did and to go home with her—I said No I don t want you —I just put her away—she laid hold of me by the collar with her left-hand—I slightly turned my head to disengage myself and perceived a man—Leonard applied a heavy blow to my mouth which I thought was with a handkerchief or some soft substance but it stunned me—before I could recover myself I was struck a heavy blow with a fist on the back of my head which stunned me—it was from neither of the women—I fell on my left side—Leonard threw herself on the top of me and at the same moment I received several severe kicks in the back which could not be from a woman—Leonard kept the handkerchief to my month—I resisted all I could to keep it away for I suspected there was something deliterious which I was to inhale—I smelt something unpleasant but the time was so short I could inhale but a very little—Conner laid hold of my watch—she had a difficulty to get it out but she did—I caught it by the guard and had it in my hand when the police came—Leonard got her hand into my pocket with the money and took some out—I laid hold of her hand but could not hold it—I felt money in her hand—I got two or three pieces of money and put them under my thigh on the ground to take care of them—I lost half-a-sovereign and about 8s —I called Police and Murder and a policeman came—I was very much alarmed—I was not six hours out of bed from Friday night till Tuesday morning and my head was very much affected—I had to use applications both to my head and back—I am not sure that I inhaled anything—I did not know the policeman—I still kept crying Murder after the second policeman came up Leonard Q If I put a handkerchief to your mouth how could you call out A By severe struggling I got the handkerchief away—I was not lying on the ground when you came up Conner Q If you were senseless how do you know that I took your watch A I was so far sensible that I knew what was going on but if the police had not come I must have given way—I was perfectly sober WILLIAM MITCHELL policeman P 229 I was in Clapham-park and heard cries of Murder and Police —I found Bass lying on the foot-path and the prisoners were three or four steps from him walking away—I stopped them and asked them what they had been at—Leonard said It is not us policeman it is a man just ran down that way pointing to the very way I had come—I had met no one and must have done so if any one had gone that way—I took them both to Bass who was lying

about 300 yards from Fox s-court Gray s-inn-lane—I heard a cry of Police saw Williams struggling with the prosecutor and took her into custody—I found this watch produced in her hand—I took her to the station—I saw a man run away and to the best of my belief Moram is the man I saw him in custody about twenty minutes after Cross-examined Q When Moram was first brought to the station did not you hear Roberts say This is not the man A No he said I believe he is the man I cannot positively swear to him —Williams had been drinking but was not drunk—I was at the police-office—Moram did not offer to make a statement—Sir George Carroll cautioned him he did not say If you take my advice you will say nothing till your trial —he said it was his duty to caution him because it might be used against him—he did not dissuade him in any way from making it Williams The policeman is the man who took the watch Witness There is no pretence for saying I took the watch from Roberts JOSEPH BAKER I am a potman and waiter and live at Pickett s-place Strand Last Saturday night about twenty minutes-past eleven o clock I was standing at a post in Victoria-street—I saw Moram go across the road towards a man and woman who were standing by the rails—he put his left arm round the prosecutor s waist struck him with his right fist at the side of the head and ran off—there was a cry of Police —I went after the pri-soner and when I got to the corner of Field-lane I was tripped up by some males and females—I then ran back and saw Williams in custody—when I first saw Moram I was walking towards him and was about a yard and a half or two yards from him and I had a good look at him and gave Fisher a description of him—we went to several places and at last found him standing at the corner of a narrow dark court in Fox-court Gray s-inn-lane—the in-stant I saw him I said he was the man—Fisher arrested him and told him the charge—he said it was a d—d lie he had not been in Victoria-street all that day—he resisted very much—Fisher was obliged to call two more police-men before he could secure him Cross-examined Q How long have you been out of employ A Three weeks—I was last at Mr Edwards s in Stanhope-street Clare-market—I was there thirteen weeks—before that I was out of employ ten weeks and before that I was in Clare-street—I do not know the meaning of the word trap—I never heard it in connection with policemen—I never heard what a police-man s trap is and never acted the part of a trap—this is the second time I have appeared in a court to give evidence—I gave evidence before on behalf of the police—I did not get any expenses—I have not been leading a strange life about the streets for two years—I was never potman in Bear-street—I live with my father and mother-in-law at 7 Pickett s-place—I do not live at 7 Robin Hood-court—on this night I saw Moram for about a minute before the transaction happened—I had no reason for taking particular notice of him—when he was first brought to the station I did not hear Roberts say That is not the man I do not know what he said I was not near him—I was talking to one of the City-police who took the charge he is not here—I will not swear Roberts did not say so—I did not go up to him and say That is the man I saw strike the blow —I did not nudge Roberts—I did not speak to him at all when the charge was entered—I left my last place through illness—I was obliged to go into the country—I came back and in a fort-night was again taken ill—I am not always dodging about Gray s-inn-lane—I go round Holborn Fleet-street and the Strand looking for a situation WILLIAM FISHER policeman G 127 Last Saturday night between eleven and twelve o clock I heard a cry in Victoria-street ran up and found the prosecutor and Williams—Baker came up to me—I went with him and found Moram in Fox-court—it was very dark where he was standing—Baker pointed him out as the man who had struck the prosecutor—I told him he was charged with being concerned with a female now in custody with assaulting and robbing a man in Victoria-street—he said it was a d—d lie he was not in Victoria-street—he was very violent and I was obliged to get the assistance of two other constables before I could take him—I saw the man running away from the prosecutor and to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man Cross-examined Q When you saw him run away you began to believe it was Moram A Yes I never saw Baker before that night—he is no trap of mine—I understand a trap to mean a man who goes about with policemen getting evidence—Moram resisted very violently—I did not hear Roberts say at the station That is not the man —he said To the best of my belief that is the man —I did not hear Baker say Yes that is the man I saw him strike you —Roberts did not then come forward and swear to him—I was at Guildhall when this charge was heard—after the Magistrate had given the prisoners the ordinary caution I did not see that Moram was about to make a statement—I did not hear the Alderman say It will be better for you to reserve what you have to say till your trial I will not swear he did not—Moram said he had nothing to say—I did not pass him by three times before I arrested him—I went straight up to him—I did not show him to Baker before I went up to him—Baker saw him at the same time as I did MR KENEALEY called ANN ALLPRESS I live at 56 Baldwin s-gardens Gray s-inn-lane My brother keeps two lodging-houses there and the prisoner occupies one room—his mother and father live there also—last Saturday I saw him several times in the course of the day—I saw him at one o clock two between three and four seven and the last time was from half-past eleven to twelve when I was going to close the shop he was then coming down-stairs from his mother s room with a hunch of bread—I have known him three years—I always found him strictly honest and he has borne a good character Cross-examined by MR M MAHON Q How near are Baldwin s-gardens to Victoria-street A I cannot say—it was not so late as twelve o clock when I saw him because we are quite closed then—it was after half-past eleven—I never saw him in Williams s company—the prisoner s mother came down into the yard just as I was going to shut the door about half-past eleven HENRY DAY Last Saturday night about half-past eleven o clock I was going for a pint of beer for my mother—I saw the prisoner coming down-stairs with a bit of bread and butter in his hand Cross-examined Q It could not have been as late as twenty minutes to twelve A No I had been to see the time just before at the beer-shop—Baldwin s-gardens is about five minutes walk from Fox-court—I had not seen him between eight and eleven—I saw Mrs Allpress shutting up her shop at the same time that I saw the prisoner MR KENEALY Q Can you say at what time before you had seen him A About a quarter to eleven he was then walking through Baldwin s-gardens into Leather-lane—there was no one with him MORAM—

t18500916-1676  1676 ROBERT ARCHER and FRANCIS DAVIS were indicted for a robbery with violence on Alfred Greenland and stealing 1 bag 1 50l Bank-note note 2 10l -notes 7 5l -notes and other moneys of Charles James Saunders and another MR PARRY conducted the Prosecution ALFRED GREENLAND I am a clerk in the employment of Charles James Saunders and another of Collingwood-street Blackfriars It was my duty to take money to the bank every morning—my time of doing so varied from half-past nine o clock to between ten and eleven—I had been in the habit of taking money to the bank every morning prior to 15th Aug —the bank was the Southwark Branch of the London and Westminster Bank in Wellington-street London-bridge—I am generally in the habit of going one way—I go through a passage near St Saviour s Dock by St Saviour s Church close by the Borough-market—on the morning of 15th Aug I started from Collingwood-street I think about half-past nine—I had with me 357l 14s 1d consisting of Bank of England notes gold and silver—there was one 50l -note I know which I had taken myself the day before seven fives I think and 31l in silver in half-crowns shillings &c —there was upwards of 100l in sovereigns and half-sovereigns—I think I had the money in my hand—I sometimes carried it over my shoulder when I had a heavier amount—it was in a bag—I very often have a heavy weight upwards of 100l in silver—nothing happened to me on my way until I got to the passage near St Saviour s-dock—I then saw a man standing against the door at the end of Church-passage—it is a very small passage which goes under a house with a door at one end near the Church—that door is fastened back to the wall in the daytime with a hook—I saw the man unhook the door and fasten it to a staple which would close the door—I could not swear to that man—it was neither of the prisoners—I put out my hand to try to pass when I had got quite close to him and he gave me a blow which was evidently intended to hit me on the head—it did not hit my head but it struck my hat—immediately upon that my hat was knocked over my eyes and they tripped me up from behind—I turned round and saw two men standing—I was then on the ground—those two men used every effort to get the money—I clung to it as long as I could—they kicked me and one fell upon my chest—I called Murder as loud as I could call—they got the money from me and as soon as they got it they ran—I could plainly see the bag in the prisoner Archer s possession—I swear positively that Archer is one of the men—I could not swear to the other—there were two men behind me and Archer is the man who took the bag—I have a belief as to Davis being the other man— I saw him among a number of prisoners at the Southwark police-court and picked him out as the man who I believed from his general appearance was the man who was in company with Archer that morning—I will not undertake to swear positively to him—I got up and followed Archer crying Stop thief —I did not notice where the other men went I kept my attention on the bag of money—Archer ran in a direction towards Bankside and came to a flour-mill there where a lot of men were stationed outside—I called Stop thief and begged them to stop him—they put out their arms to stop him and he ran in a direction as though he was coming to the passage again—I stood at the end of the passage—he appeared to be coming right at me but he took a different direction and ran down a street at the back of the passage—I still followed him into a court where there is no thoroughfare and he then ran into a house—some gentleman who is not here ran in and seized him—I saw him seize him—I got up before him—Archer was standing looking round as if he was about to make for the stairs but there was some one I believe on the stairs and he stood there—I ran up to him and said Now you wretch give me that bag and he handed it over to me—it contained the money—he was then given into custody—I think it was on the Thursday after that I saw Davis—I had never seen either of the prisoners before Cross-examined by MR M PRENDERGAST Q You say you were knocked down and your hat was over your eyes how was it that you saw Archer with the bag A As soon as I was down I pushed my hat from my eyes and then saw Archer with the bag—I do not know whether he lives in the house where he was taken—when I asked him for the bag he gave it me—I should say five minutes elapsed between my being knocked down and recovering possession of the bag—I ran some distance—the passage where this occurred is very narrow two persons cannot walk through abreast comfortably and it is not quite so long as this Counsel table—there is a door at one end which is usually kept open in the day-time—there is no skylight but plenty of light comes in at each end—I was a very short time on the ground—it was a very violent blow that I received—it was only one blow—that was given me by the man who was standing against the door Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Whoever it was you saw with Archer it was somebody about Davis s age and size I suppose A Yes he was not in the dock at the police-court when I pointed him out—eight or nine of them were brought out of their cells—I had not seen the policeman before he told me to come and see them MR PARRY Q from the time you saw Archer in the passage did you follow him A Yes and never lost sight of him EDWARD WOOD I am a fruit-salesman in the Borough-market On the morning of 15th Aug a little before ten o clock I was passing St Mary Overy dock in the direction from Southwark towards Blackfriars-bridge and when I got about the middle of the passage underneath the archway I saw three men coming towards me Archer Davis and another man—the passage is very narrow and I stood on one side to allow them to pass thinking they were coming through but they did not—they came up to the end of the passage—Archer stationed himself nearest to me on the footpath—Davis placed himself underneath the loophole of the warehouse exactly facing Archer—the third person placed his back towards the river but each with their faces directed towards Blackfriars-bridge the way they came from—I looked very hard at them and as I passed Archer said to Davis Here he comes and looked up towards Bankside—I particularly noticed the faces of these two— Davis had his eyes on the ground and when Archer spoke to him he looked up and looked that way—this could not have occupied more than a minute—I passed them and went on fifteen or twenty feet further—I then heard a cry of Stop thief murder —I had gone into a water-closet which is there for the use of the clerks of the wharf—I kept on the alert more than I should have done having noticed these three men there—when I heard the cry I came out and the moment I came out Archer had got a blue bag in his hand and was making away as fast as he could—the prosecutor was crying out Murder stop thief he has got my money or something of that sort—exactly facing me and behind him was Davis and the other man together—I said You scoundrels you are both of you engaged in this robbery as well as he —they all three ran—I followed Archer and never lost sight of him till he gave the bag into Mr Greenland s hands—I saw Davis about a week after at the police-station—there was no other person there but the policemen—I have no hesitation in swearing that Davis is the man I addressed when I said You two scoundrels are connected in this robbery Cross-examined by MR M PRENDERGAST Q How long is this passage A About fourteen feet—it is very narrow—it will not admit two persons to pass abreast—the place before you come to the passage is very narrow for about twenty feet it will not allow two persons to pass comfortably on account of the dock—after you get through the passage the road is about fifteen feet wide just room enough for a cart to back under the loophole—the water-closet is after you pass through the passage not more than twenty feet through to the left—Archer was standing close to me Davis facing him and the third with his back towards the river but all their faces directed towards Bankside—I was coming from the Borough Market—from the time I first saw them till I heard the scream of Murder was not more than three or four minutes Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Is this water-closet one that you ordinarily use A It is sometimes I did what I went there for—when I first saw the men I was in the passage—it is a covered passage underneath a house—they were within ten feet of each other—their backs were not turned towards me—I was told that Davis was in custody before I went to the station to see him—one of the policemen told me he did not take me there he left word at my house—my reason for keeping on the alert was that I had it in my mind very strongly that they were about committing the robbery—I have been in Courts of Justice perhaps half-a-dozen times within twenty years MR PARRY Q Did you give information to the police A I gave a description of the men to the police as near as I could—it was the policeman to whom I described them that left word at my house JAMES BERRY policeman M 163 On 15th Aug Archer was given into my custody by Mr Greenland who at the same time handed me this bag—it contained 357l 14s 1d —Archer said that the case was clear enough against him he had nothing to say Cross-examined by MR M PRENDERGAST Q Did he not say that the bag was thrown to him by somebody else A Yes and that he ran away with it—he did not say he had picked it up—I mentioned before the Magistrate that he said the case was clear enough against him JOHN WRIGHT policeman M 3 I received a description from Mr Wood in consequence of which I tried to apprehend Davis and did so on 20th Aug with another prisoner who made his escape from me at the Holly Branch public-house Waterloo-road—the other man gave the name of Bentley—he has since been apprehended on another charge—Davis was taken to the station and I there told him he was charged on suspicion of being concerned with Archer in a highway robbery on Alfred Greenland near Bankside on 15th Aug —he said nothing then but before the Magistrate he said he could prove he was not there he could prove he was at 8 St Andrew s-terrace in bed with a female Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q That was after he had heard the evidence against him and the time mentioned A Yes ARCHER— GUILTY Aged 21 DAVIS— GUILTY Aged 20 Transported for Fifteen Years 
t18501021-1852  1852 HENRY DENHAM was indicted for that he being armed with a certain offensive weapon together with others did feloniously assault Thomas Miller with intent to rob him MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution THOMAS MILLER I am an artist in colours by appointment to Her Majesty and carry on business in Long-acre On Friday night Aug 2nd I was returning home from Chelsea—the clock struck twelve as I passed through St James s-park—I should say it was a quarter-past when I got to Long-acre—as I passed Rose-street on the right side of Long-acre as you come from St Martin Vlane I felt both my arms pinned from behind—I had a roll of drawings three feet long in one hand and a walking-stick in the other—at the same instant I was faced by another person and a third appeared at my left side at least I guess it was a third—I then saw the prisoner standing with what I thought was a walking-stick—he came up to me on my right and immediately a machine was put round my neck from the right side I have no doubt by the prisoner—I had had a full view of him by the light of the lamp waiting to put this infernal machine round my neck—I was completely strangled—my coat was unbuttoned and ray waistcoat pockets were torn—this eye-glass was taken from my pocket and the word Eye-glass was mentioned by one of the men—I was still standing up—all sensation left me and I was dead to all intents and purposes by strangulation—I have every reason to believe that at that moment some alarm was given for I was loosened and dashed on the kerb-stone by which one of my teeth was broken out and my chin was very severely fractured—on recovering I saw one man at a distance—I think he did not know the passage out and could not get away without passing me—I chased him about a quarter of a mile but the pressure which had been on my throat disabled me from calling out and I lost him—I met a policeman and proceeded to Bow-street station—I arrived there at twenty minutes past twelve and made a complaint—I am enabled to speak to the prisoner by the gas-light behind me shining directly on his face—I did not describe him that night but next morning I wrote to Scotland-yard—I saw him again at the Mansion-house about two months afterwards—I did not know he was in custody I saw him by chance at the bar among other persons—I went there because I heard a person had been taken into custody—the other persons were close by—I cannot say whether it was the bar—before I recognised him I had a communication with Haydon one of the detective-police—he did not point the prisoner out—on my solemn oath I have not the least doubt he is the man—I saw a flexible walking-stick at the station with a life-preserver at the end of it—by putting the two ends together when round a man s neck and twisting them strangulation would immediately take place—I believe it was an instrument of this kind that was applied to my neck Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q You gave no description of the person to the police either that night or next morning A No I had not been at the Mansion House a moment before I recognized him—the next time he was brought up was on my charge—I was not with Haydon when I recognized him—on the night this happened I had been to King s-road Chelsea—I supped there—I had dined at home—I believe I took a small glass of brandy and water at supper—I think I may say I did not take more than one glass but could not pledge my oath now—the man I chased was in front of me when I got up I chased him into Hart-street Covent-garden through the courts which are very intricate and there lost him—I saw the prisoner immediately upon being pinioned—I could not recognize the man who pinioned me—the street-lamp was behind me eight or ten yards off—it is in the centre of and lights up the underneath part of the archway which is the entry to Rose-street—this was not five minutes taking place—it was more than a minute—the man who faced me came suddenly upon me which prevented my seeing his face and my attention was called to the face of the prisoner and fixed upon it—I saw the prisoner immediately I was pinioned and before I saw the man who faced me I should fancy I was insensible two or three minutes—the whole of it did not occupy five minutes it was done very cleverly indeed nothing could be done better—there were a great many people at the Mansion-house—I did not see the bar at that time—I was never there before—I went there expecting to see the man who had treated me in this way—I described the prisoner on the night previous to my seeing him to Haydon—I had read no description of him in the papers then—I had read in the papers about Mr Cure ton s case in Aldersgate-street—that was before I gave the description—Haydon came to my house in consequence of a card which I left in the City about the middle of Sept before I went into the country—the prisoner s hat was put on him at the Mansion-house at my suggestion—Haydon was not standing by him when I first saw him or when I charged him with being the person who assaulted me—he was removed from the bar to the lock-up and then I went and saw Haydon and told him he was the man—that was after I had ordered his hat to be put on and not five minutes after I first saw him MR BODKIN Q Was it such an instrument as this that was used produced A I should say it was—I saw it at the station—it might be a week or a fortnight after I had read the account of Mr Cureton s case that I went into the country—I was suffering very much from this attack and am now—I had no communication with any one about this till the evening before I went to the Mansion-house—I am quite certain Haydon had not described the person who was in custody before I described the prisoner to him nor had any one else—there was nothing at the Mansion-house in my view to distinguish the prisoner from those by whom he was surrounded—I did not look at him a second before I made up my mind it was him—the man wore a had on that night and I had the prisoner s hat put on to see if I could recognize him in a hat as well as without one—I had no doubt about him before it was put on MICHAEL HAYDON City-policeman 21 I am one of the detective force On 2nd Oct I took the prisoner on another charge—I had then no knowledge of Mr Miller or his address I obtained it on 6th Oct —I went to his house and he described the person by whom he had been attacked—I had not described any person to him who was in custody—he came next day to the Mansion-house by my desire—he found his way into the justice-room without any communication with me—the prisoner was then in the dock with two persons whose turn it was to go up before him—Mr Miller then made a communication to me—I saw the prisoner s hat put on in the dock shortly after Mr Miller gave his evidence—I saw this instrument found at Hoxton in the house of a man who was taken with the prisoner Cross-examined Q Who was the other man A I key Williams—the prisoner was not told that he was discharged in Mr Cureton s case—he had been remanded twice it was then abandoned—it was not in consequence of Mr Cureton s case being called on by the clerk that the prisoner made his appearance—remanded cases are not necessarily taken at a particular time but generally they are—I brought the prisoner up from below—Mr Cureton was not examined—I think no one was examined but Mr Humphrey the attorney asked for a remand for further evidence—that was before Mr Miller made any communication to me—I did not come up with the prisoner from below I sent him up—I stood on the stairs and he stood in the dock—the other two prisoners were not examined before the prisoner was remanded—every case takes its turn—I had taken the prisoner down into the dock before I heard Mr Miller make any charge—the place where the prisoners stand is enclosed from where the public are by a very low iron rail—it is about sixteen inches wide—Mr Miller stood close by the door which leads to the ante-room about six feet from the bench MR BODKIN Q Had the two persons who were in the dock been brooght up from below by this narrow staircase A I do not know—they may have been admitted to bail in which case they would come in at the ordinary entrance—I saw them there when I got into the dock—they were standing up—I passed them so as nearly to touch them—Mr Miller must have seen them—the doors of the enclosure are of wood but the enclosure itself is an iron railing—a rail was round to afford means of egress—I took the prisoner at the Red House public-house Pearl-row Blackfriars—he said he was ill and an out-patient s letter from St Thomas s Hospital was found upon him—I did not find it and cannot tell the date of it—I believe he lives in Martin-street Blackfriars GUILTY Aged 33 — Transported for Twenty Years

property MR KENEALY conducted the Prosecution JOHN BROOMFIELD I live in Northampton-row Clerkenwell and am a gold-beater On Saturday evening 19th Oct I was out between eight and nine o clock in the evening—I met the prisoner Croughan by the House of Correction wall—we had something to drink on the opposite side of the way—I took her to two public-houses—I had a silver watch in my right-hand waistcoat pocket a chain and a gold seal a gold-book in my pocket and a shilling—we went to Snow-hill I saw Hart there—we had a pot of beer between me Hart Croughan and another young woman—I left the house with Croughan and a woman followed us who I believe was Hart—I went to an alley in Field-lane and went up-stairs into a room with Croughan—I had not been in the room many minutes before some one said Down the candle was put out and I was seized round the throat by a man as I suppose from the force I was held by—Croughan Hart and another woman were in the room—I fell on the floor and felt my watch going but I was choked and could not speak—the person who kept me down released my throat—I was in the dark—I scrambled down into the back-yard—I found a bit of a shutter and hammered away at it—some man inside said What are you making that noise for —he opened his door and let me into a yard the end of which was Field-lane—I placed my back against a shop and said I have been robbed of my watch —I searched my pocket and my piece of gold-book watch chain seal key and shilling were gone—I shortly afterwards saw a policeman—I described Croughan to him and he went and fetched her—I identified her and I went home—between two and three o clock the policeman knocked me up and brought Hart—I identified her and went to the station and gave her in charge COURT Q Had you been drinking before you saw them A A little—I then went home to my wife and gave her my wages—I then went out to go to my club and met the prisoners—I was not sober when I went to the house in Field-lane I was about half-and-half—I felt my watch safe up in the room Croughan Q You told me you had one shilling and you called for half a quartern of gin and put down a shilling A It is very likely but I don t know that I did—I went to my club and then came back met you again and went to this house—I did not give you any gold-leaf—I am very much mistaken if I did not see Hart—I should not like to say I am quite sure of her—you did not go home and leave the other young woman with me MR KENEALY Q How long were you drinking with Hart in the second house A Perhaps five minutes—there were three girls and myself—during that time I looked at Hart—it was not from my description of her that the officer brought her to me JOHN THORNTON policeman G 174 On Saturday week about twelve o clock at night I saw Broomfield in Field-lane and from what he told me I went in pursuit of Croughan—I met her about half-past twelve—I told her I wanted her on suspicion of robbing a man of his watch—I described the man to her—she said she had been with the man but knew nothing about his watch—I took her to the station—she was searched and on her was found this little book—I took Hart at two in the morning—Broomfield described her to me and showed me the front room first-floor—I have known Hart to live there for the last nine months—I said I wanted her on suspicion of being concerned with others in robbing a man of his watch—she said she had been drinking with the man but had not seen him since half-past eleven o clock—she said she had had part of a pot of beer at a public-home on Snow-hill with him—I took her to Broughton and he identified her ELIZA VOLLER I searched Croughan and found on her this book JOHN BROOMFIELD I had a book similar to this in my pocket—I am positive I did nut give her this book—I did not show the officer the room in which the robbery took place I did not know the room—I believe it was the back room but I was strangled—it was in the same room that I was in that this took place—I am sure that was the house Witnesses for the Defence EMMA DAY I am a widow and go out charing I have known Hart about eighteen months she is an honest girl—she brings washing to me—I don t

t18510106-347  347 WILLIAM THOMPSON was indicted for a robbery with violence on Adolphus Dubois together with other persons and stealing 1 watch and 1 guard chain value 5l 10s his goods MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution ADOLPHUS DUBOIS I am a dentist and live at 65 Princes-street Leicester-square On the evening of 18th Dec I was in Upper Norton-street about a quarter-past nine o clock—it was raining—as I approached No 68 or 67 there were three men posted in the doorway as if they were out of the rain—as soon as I reached the door one of them came on to the footway and put a gag or rope which I do not exactly know round my neck—I recognise the prisoner as that man because his eye met mine—the rope was compressed round my neck the effect of which was to render me powerless—I endeavoured to utter some words to the purport of Let me give you what I have and allow me to go and on my endeavouring to do so the other two came from the doorway as I supposed to assist him—they said something to the effect of Give it him or Go it and upon that the compression was increased it was awful—when I recovered my consciousness I saw the two men who are not in custody walk very leisurely away—I saw them go to the first turning—they did not go towards No 38 but the reverse way—the prisoner did not go with them—there was no one else in the street at the time from the moment I entered it—I suffered palpitations and great giddiness after this—my eyes were swollen to a great extent and full of water—there was a mark on my neck which I showed at the station where the instrument was applied—I continued to suffer for several days for ten or twelve days I was not sufficiently well to attend to business—when I recovered myself and the three men were gone I found that my coat was torn and my watch and chain gone—the chain which was under my waistcoat was wrenched and they had cut my neck severely in their efforts to take it by force—I afterwards saw my watch at the station—I called out after I recovered myself as loud as I had the power to do Cross-examined by MR COCKLE Q How long do you suppose you were under this compression A I cannot tell—the two men who I saw going away were not a great way from me when I recovered myself I cannot say how far—my eyes were full of water—I was panting for breath and in an awful state—I suppose they were about the distance of that lamp from me six or eight yards —I had never seen the prisoner before that night—he first came off the step on the left side of me and applied this compression—he then passed round to my right side and compressed it there—my eye caught his as he came off the steps on to the flag—I looked to see what he was going to do—at first I thought it was a joke from somebody I knew—I recognise him well because I looked in his face—it was all done in a moment—the compression began directly and when I muttered it was increased—my whole frame was completely paralysed—my sight is very good I wear a glass but that I perform very minute operations with—it was not raining very heavily at this time—I afterwards went to the station in a cab and saw the prisoner there—I said I should not be able to recognise the other men because they were in the dark doorway but I saw their feet when they approached me—they did not come down the steps at the same time as the third man—I had no hesitation whatever about the prisoner when I saw him in the strong light—I never said he was not the man or that I was not sure of him nothing of the kind—I was more fully sure of him when I saw him in a strong light—the street was darkish—I first noticed the number of the house from which the men came a few days afterwards when I returned to the spot and examined it it was when I returned from the country after getting better—I think it was the day before the remand Wednesday 18th Dec—I lost sight of the man who put the instrument round my neck but I saw him when he compressed it—the injury I received was so severe that I was obliged to be under a surgeon s care in the country MR PAYNE Q DO I understand you to say that the prisoner went by himself in one direction and the other two in another direction A Yes I saw the prisoner again on the opposite side of the street with Mr Tarring—Mr Tarring told me to come over but I could not move JOHN TARRING I am an architect of Charles-street Middlesex Hospital On Wednesday night 18th Dec I was in Upper Norton-street with a friend on the opposite side to the prosecutor—I saw some persons on the opposite side of the way and about a minute after I saw them I heard a cry of Police —I saw two men go away in one direction and another one the prisoner came over towards me—there was then only one left on the opposite side of the way and that turned out to be the prosecutor—I caught hold of the prisoner and held him fast till a policeman came—I think we were near the house No 38 but I would not swear to that positively—the prosecutor was still on the opposite side—he was partly in the street endeavouring to pick up his hat which had been knocked off—I crossed over with the prisoner—the policeman came up as I was crossing and we walked over together—while I was there Mrs Curll brought a watch—the place where it was said to have been found was pointed out to me—I was near there at the time I had hold of the prisoner Cross-examined Q You were walking down the street on this occasion A Yes on my way home—it was a very wet night and rather dark—it was raining very heavily—the first I saw was what appeared to me to be four or five persons I could not tell how many on the opposite side—they were about thirty yards from me—the place where the watch was found was pointed out to me that same night within ten minutes of the transaction—a servant girl came with the watch—the prosecutor had stated before that he had lost a watch—I saw two men walking down the street together—it was not one of those two that came over to me—the person who crossed the street came directly to where I was—he came on to the footway and I met him and immediately took hold of him—he said he was only walking up the street—he attempted to walk off and I grasped him by the collar—he did not struggle or try to break away from me—I did not walk away with him immediately from the spot—we were there two or three minutes at the least MATILDA CURLL I am a widow and live at 38 Upper Norton-street On Wednesday night 18th Dec I was in my parlour I heard cries of Murder and Stop thief —I went to the street-door and saw three men at the next door—they were close together—I heard nothing said but I saw a hand through my railing and something fell from it—it made a noise as it fell—I sent ray servant to pick it up—I saw her pick it up—it was a watch and chain—it was shown to the prosecutor and produced before the Magistrate Cross-examined Q When you came out of your house did you see the prosecutor A I saw three parties—they came to my door afterwards saying they had been robbed—after the watch was found they went on the other side of the way—it was the prosecutor who said he had been robbed—I cannot say whose hand it was that dropped the watch MR PAYNE Q Was it the hand of one of the three A Yes the prosecutor was one Mr Tarring the other and the prisoner the third FREDERICK WHITE policeman E 33 On Wednesday night 18th Dec about half-past nine o clock in consequence of hearing some cries in Upper Norton-street I went there and found the prosecutor—he appeared very ill and very much excited—he complained of having been injured—Mr Tarring brought the prisoner over from the opposite side of the way in a direction from 38 towards 68 and said This is one of them —the watch was brought to me by a female—I searched the prisoner at the station and found on him a key and a duplicate but no money—I produce the watch Cross-examined Q Is the servant here to-day A She is not ADOLPHUS DUBOIS

supper—I went in front of the bar—I saw the prisoner and three more young men—they called one another Walley Buffer and Goosey—the prisoner was with them—he had nothing in his hand then—I called for half a quartern of rum for me and my brother-in-law—I heard one of the men I do not know which say Buz and instantly the prisoner seized me and struck me three times on the head with a pint-pot which caused me to fall to the ground—we had not spoken a word to either of them—I found the prisoner s hand in my pocket and screamed out Murder but nobody came—I held his arm—we struggled on the

went with me—I was in the public-house about eighteen minutes—I asked for the beer directly I went in and was there two or three minutes speaking to my brother-in-law asking him what he would have and he preferred half a quartern of rum—I did not get the beer there was some neglect—there was only the landlady behind the bar—the blow on the head did not stun me—I am sure it was the prisoner that struck me ELLEN MOOR I was in Mr Squibb s service I went to the public-house to fetch him home on this morning between one and two o clock—I heard no words but just as I got inside I saw the prisoner strike Mr Squibb with a pint pot as he stood at the bar with his brother-in-law—I saw three other men there—my master instantly fell to the ground a mob surrounded him—the prisoner had a pint pot in one hand covered with blood—my master held him by the band and screamed out Police —one of the mob caught hold of him by the throat and the prisoner got away—they then let my matter loose he got up

went with Squibb to the King s Arms between one and two o clock in the morning—he charged the prisoner with beating him on the head with a pint pewter pot and when he was on the ground robbing him of 31s —he said he was in there at the time but he was innocent of the robbery or else he said Forty b y policemen should not take me for it I was on the ground in the affair but I am innocent of the robbery —when Squibb found me that morning he was perhaps 100 yards from the public-house—I knew the prisoner before and judged who it was by Squibb s description Cross-examined Q What time did Squibb tell you he had been robbed A Between one and two o clock in the morning—I took the prisoner between one and two—I found no money on him MR MEW called HARRIET CALDWELL On 6th Jan between one and two o clock in the night Squibb came to the house with three females and a male—the females called for rum and paid me for it and then afterwards he called for a quartern of rum—I drew it—he did not pay—I asked him to do so and he said he had no money in his pocket but he had plenty at homehe requested Mrs Evans who was there to pay for it—she refused—Squibb s wife was there I took a pint pot out of her hand because I saw her strike some person on the head—they were all very tipsy—they were in front of the bar and I was behind it—I could see everything that went on and can say positively that the

CLARKSON Q Are you the landlady of the King s Arms Mint-street A I am I have never had such a piece of work as this before or since—Squibb was not very tipsy Mrs Evans is his sister-in-law—my husband never thieves—he has only been summoned twice since he has been there that I swear—I do not think he has been summoned three times this month for harbouring thieves—he was never summoned for harbouring thieves at all and was never fined 10s for it— he was fined 20s on Christmas-eve it was for bad characters coming there not for harbouring them—he is a commercial traveller and as honest and respectable a man as you are he never kept a public-house before this he kept a beer-shop the Brass Founders Arms in Whitechapel some time ago—he took it with the intention of getting a license but he could not—we left because we could not pay our way in it—that may be about twelve months ago we have been six months at the King s Arms—my husband was with Mr White all the time we were there—the other time that my husband was fined might have been some weeks before Christmas I cannot tell how many it was for the same parties being there they came in when my husband was out—I do not know that they were the very same parties of whom the prisoner formed one on this night—my husband was never fined before that he was summoned—Squibb never came to my house with a jug in his hand—nobody was knocked down with a pewter-pot in my house they were knocked down by Squibb s brother with his fist I saw him do it—it was a very big stout man his name is Joseph or John Evans—he had a white coat on this is one of the buttons which is left of it—I do not know what has become of him he was a stranger to me—he has not preferred any charge against the prisoner s brother that I am aware of—I do not know the name of the man who was knocked down they used to call him Richard—I know Woller Buffer and Evans they lodge at the house—I know nothing about Goosey I have not heard the name at my house—this matter was inquired into before the Magistrate on the following day—my husband was not there I went but was not examined—there was no attorney there for the prisoner—I do not know who his attorney is now—I saw the person who was to speak for him that was Mr Wight MR PARRY Q Do you know whether the witnesses for the defence were offered before the Magistrate A Yes I was there with Henry Taylor we were not called on to give evidence HENRY TAYLOR I know Squibb between one and two o clock on this morning I was standing in front of the bar of the King s Arms—I was there all day I was in the bar-parlour—Squibb came in after one or between one and two there were some women with him—I cannot say whether he had a jug in his hand I believe he had not—they were standing at the bar drinking when a man named Evans who I believe is a relation of Squibb s came in and stood conversing with Squibb and the women some short time—he said I have got a little account or a little business to settle or some words to that effect and immediately took off his hat gave it to a person to hold and knocked a man down who was standing by the side of the beer-engine—an altercation took place immediately and Squibb and these women immediately commenced an attack on him while he was on the ground—the landlord came immediately from behind the bar and I with his assistance parted them—an altercation occurred again immediately the prisoner came in at that time and seeing the man down lent him assistance so as he should not be ill-used—the prisoner did not strike him he was immediately knocked down himself—Squibb and the women who were with him ill-used him as much as they possibly could till the landlord was obliged to call in the police to quell the disturbance and a general fight took place they were all fighting then—Squibb said nothing then about his loosing his watch and money not in my hearing— I did not observe any watch with him the prisoner had not the least opportunity of taking the watch and money from Squibb and I should say it was quite impossible—I only know Squibb by seeing him come to the house Cross-examined Q What time in the morning did yon go to this public-house A It might have been in the middle of the day 12 o clock but I cannot say—I am a tailor and work at Bethnal-green on my own account—my father-in-law keeps this house—his name is Caldwell— Squibb may have been knocked down when I was not able to discern it—there were so many persons in front of the bar I do not know whether he was or not—I did not hear him call out Murder or Police —it would be impossible for me to swear he did not—there was such a disturbonce that I was not able to distinguish whether he did or not—I think the servant Ellen Moor was one of the women who was with him—I will not be positive she might have been I cannot say—I did not see Squibb on the ground—I have seen the prisoner there two or three times since I have been there—I do not go there every day—I never knew where he lived—I do not remember Squibb coming there the next day with the policeman I was not there—I do not know the name of the man whom Evans knocked down—I had seen him once before when he came in to have a pint of beer which might have been a week previous—I believe Squibb was sober I did not take particular notice—I cannot say what he called for when he came in—the bar-parlour was about the distance from him that you are from me—some of them called for something and I believe he had some I do not know what it was—I cannot say what has become of the man who was knocked down—he went away—nobody was given in charge that I am aware of—I do not know Woller or Buffer—I have heard the prisoner called Goosey—I did not hear anybody say Buz that night—I saw blood on Squibb s head I did not see any or one of the pint pots HENRY CALDWELL I keep this house I saw Squibb there on the night of this disturbance—he came in about half-past twelve or one o clock with Evans his brother-in-law and three women—Evans has not been here to-day that I know of—I swear Squibb had not a jug in his hand—he and the females were drinking spirits and half-and-half before the bar—he then called for a quartern of rum—I saw him served with it—he turned round to Mrs Evans Evans sister-in-law and said You pay for this for I have no money —she said No more have I any money so you must put it up —when they had drank that another Evans came in and they asked him what he was going to stand and to have a pint of mixed liquors—as soon as they had drank that Evans pulled off his bat and gave it to one of them and said Here is the b here that you have got some business to settle with or something of that kind—he knocked a man down—I ran out of the bar to his assistance—we got him up and they directly pitched into him again—he cried for assistance—the prisoner came to his assistance and they commenced fighting altogether—I saw they were uncontrollable and called out Police —the police came—I did not see the prisoner strike Squibb with a pot but I could not see everything—I had as much as I could do to try and separate them—I know Squibb by his living opposite and keeping a lodging-house or something of that sort—I have not known him long I have only been there eight months—I have heard sufficient of his character not to believe him upon his oath according to what has been told to me by his sister-in-law Cross-examined Q Did you ever hear him examined on his oath A No I have been convicted once of harbouring thieves not that I did it—it may be two months back—that was the second time—I was fined a guinea—the first time was a month or six weeks before—I was fined 10s —I am not aware that the third conviction forfeits the license—I have never been summoned before that I swear that—there were two summonses the last time but I have only appeared in Court on two separate days—one was on Saturday which was dismissed and the other was on Monday which I was fined a guinea for MR PARRY Why would not you believe the prosecutor on his oath have you ever heard him say anything as to his being convicted A No I do not speak of what I have heard of him but what I have heard from others about him GUILTY ** Aged 22 — Transported for Ten Years Before Russell Gurney Esq

I am a tea-dealer of Somers -terrace Walworth-road On Sunday morning 12th Jan between one and two o clock I was returning home with my son who is nine years old—we went down West-street which leads from Walworth-road into Lorimer-place—I heard two men walking rapidly behind me—I crossed out of West-street across the end of Canterbury-place—this is the position of the road— looking at a plan —I turned round saw two men and heard them whisper—I was surprised at their being behind me so quickly—I immediately received a blow on my head with a life-preserver I should imagine from the prisoner but I could not distinctly swear it—I turned round and directly received mother blow on my right temple with an instrument like this life-preserver produced —I had an umbrella and struck and thrust at them once or twice—there is a lamp at this corner pointing to it —I backed towards it—I called out Murder and they both rushed on me—one of them knocked off my hat and I received a blow I cannot say from which of them—my little boy ran away and called out—one of them ran after him—the other still kept pursuing me—I kept defending myself with my umbrella and I received several blows on my shoulders with a short stick or life-preserver—I saw nothing more of the man that went after my boy—after that man had gone away I struck and thrust at the other with my umbrella—one of the thrusts took effect on his hat—after some time a window was thrown open and he ran away about twenty yards on the other side of the way in the direction of the Bee-Hive—he then returned and ran up

speak to the features of the prisoner but to the personal appearance up to the time then he came under the lamp A I saw his face distinctly when they made the attack and I saw enough of him before he left me to swear to him—I saw his face distinctly before he ran past the lamp but perhaps not quite so well as when he ran past it because the light was so straight on him then—up to that time I could have spoken more to his figure than hit face—I have had another person taken up on this charge—his name is Spencer—I swore to biro but the Magistrate discharged him—I believe he gave his address—I have never ordered him to be sent for since—I preferred no indictment against him—I swore to him as positively as I do to the prisoner JAMES KEY policeman P 354 On this morning I was on duty a few yards from the Bee-Hive at the corner of Lorimer-road and heard cries of Murder and Police a few yards off—I went to the spot—I had a light which was visible in front of me—I found Mr Wigg at the

ran away followed by the other two—I missed my watch but the guard remained in the button-hole with the handle of the watch to it—a fortnight after that I was at Worship-street Police-court when there was another charge made against Hurley—I heard some one speak and I heard a cough and a voice and I recognised them as that of the first person who assisted me—when he coughed I said That is the man who coughed that assisted me —he had coughed at the time he lifted me up—I also knew the voice—I heard it more than once Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q How long have you been afflicted A Two years last Jan —I had good eyesight before that—the little girl is eight years old—she is sensible for her age and able to give evidence—she is not here—she was before the Magistrate but was not examined—I went to the police-court in consequence of information I received from a policeman a witness in this case—I was informed a certain person was going to be charged and I went on purpose to ascertain if that was one of the persons who had assaulted me—I went to see if I could recognise the voice—Ellen Wheatman was in Court—the charge was assaulting her—Hurley was remanded on that charge and I made my charge—I could not see whether Wheatman was then in Court but I bad not heard her ordered out ELLEN WHEATMAN I am the wife of Thomas Wheatman a bedstead-maker of 22 Christopher-street I have known Hurley sixteen months—he has visited in the house where I live—on 28th April about 4 o clock in the afternoon I was with him and another man and woman at a public-house at the corner of Crown-street—Hurley left the public-house—I followed in about ten minutes and saw him alone on the other side of the road and I went after him down New Inn-passage or yard—I saw Mr Collins in the act of being picked up and Hurley was at his right side and Catton who had joined Hurley at his left—I saw Hurley put his hand into Mr Collins s pocket but I cannot say whether it was his watch pocket or hit waistcoat pocket and I saw Catton hold Mr Collins s left arm while Hurley twisted the watch off—Mr Collins put his hand to his pocket said I am not hurt and then said You have got my watch —Hurley ran away instantly Catton after him and another man who was there—about an hour afterwards I saw Hurley in Curtain-road which is five minutes walk from New Inn-passage—he said to me Was not that a daring robbery —I said Yes it was he is a poor blind man and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves —I said that he had lost his watch and Hurley said Yes I sold it to big Mich in Petticoat-lane for 16s —I gave two of them 3s 6d each and kept the remainder for myself —I had known Catton six months—on 20th May I went with a policeman to a beer-shop in Spitalfields saw Catton outside and as soon as he saw me coming he went inside—I went in picked him out and the officer took him—on 12th May Hurley assaulted me and on 13th he was examined on that charge at Worship-street—after that examination this charge was made against him and he was remanded for a week—I do not know whether the case of assault on me has been determined Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Was not he discharged in your case A The Magistrate said he would think of it I took him there for stabbing and nearly throttling me—I do not know the two females or the male that were with us at the public-house they were Hurley s acquaintances—we had one pot of fourpenny ale there—I am living with my husband and have done so ten years—I have never been away from him—I do not know whether my husband knew I went and drank with Hurley—he was at work—my husband is very deaf—we had all been together three or four hours before we went to the public-house—we had been at one other public-house—we had no gin we had two pots of half-and-half between the four of us there—I paid for some of it—I had drunk with Hurley before at my sister s where I first became acquainted with him—I dare say I have drunk with him in other public-houses when my husband has been there—I do not know that I ever drank with him in a public-house without my husband before this day—I may have been with him in other public-houses—I may have met him several times when we were going the same road and walked with him—I swear I have never lived with him—I did not say a word about this robbery for a fortnight because he threatened he would cut my head open if I gave him a day s imprisonment—I saw him on the Saturday night after this robbery and the policeman would not take him and I saw him again in the Curtain-road in the open street where he threatened me and I saw him a third time in Christopher-square where he lives—I saw him in the Curtain-road within an hour after the robbery—when he told me Was not that a daring robbery he said If you was to split one word I would either cut the front of your head in or cut your throut —he threatened me again on the Saturday when he came and made a disturbance at my house—my husband was at work next door and I went out with a neighbour to my adjoining lodger s—the third time he threatened roe was at the same place at 12 o clock at night when my husband was at home—I complained to him and he begged the prisoner to go away quietly and on the Monday night he stabbed me—I know a person named Underwood who lives in Long-alley—Hurley did not complain to me during the fortnight about him—he did not tell me he had heard I was a married woman he knowed it because my husband told him so—he did not say he should think no more of me because he had ascertained I was married and had seen me walking with Underwood—I have not walked with Underwood further than being in a public-house with him once on 12th May when he gave me 1s 6d and Hurley grasped me by the throat—I do not know big Mick I have heard of him Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q How often have you seen Catton A Once or twice a week for six months he was smoking in this beer-shop when he was apprehended—I never saw the prosecutor before this happened—I have seen him several times since when we have been up at the office and here—I had been out the day this happened five or six hours from half-past eleven or twelve o clock—I did not leave borne with Hurley I met him in Longalley—we only had those four pots during the day—I did not say anything about this till 12th May because I was frightened—on 12th May I told a policeman in Tabernacle-row—I had not then beard anything about the prosecutor and I did not know where he lived—I knew he was blind because after Hurley ran away I stopped a few minutes—I did not see Catton from 28th April till he was taken MR HORRY Q Did you not say to Margaret Hurley and Mrs Goodwin that you were sorry for what you had done A I said I should be very sorry if he was transported I should like him to have six or twelve months for what he had done and I think he deserves it for robbing the poor blind man BENJAMIN ROBERTS policeman G 1 I took Hurley on the night of 12th May about half-past 2 o clock in the morning—he was charged by the last witness with an assault upon her—there was a cut over her eye which was bleeding and there were marks of violence upon her throat—I took

WILLIAM DAY I am a trunk-maker at 358 Strand On Sunday 27th July I was on my way home on the right-hand side of White lion-street—I went up Mercer-street which is in a line with White Lion-street and continues to Long Acre—as I entered Mercer-street I saw Best cross from the right side of Mercer-street to the left upon that I crossed also—I followed he was about fifteen or twenty yards in advance of me he walked slowly and I walked quickly and came up with him—when I was about five yards from him I saw another man cross from the right-side to the left towards where I was—when I came up to Best on the left-hand side a pause took place for a second he then let me pass about a foot the other man was close to my back we were in a manner all three together—when I got about a foot onwards Best came and put one hand to the back of my neck and the other in front the other assisted him in strangling me and I was made speechless directly—I cannot tell which gave me the most pressure—they kept me in that position for a second or two—Best leant over me with his face within a foot of mine and said Press him tight or Squeeze him tight —I kept my hand on my watch I was pressed tight and became senseless—when I came to myself I was sitting on the pavement and my watch and chain were gone—I called Police but very faintly a policeman came and I went to the station—I was very ill and kept my bed for five days—I was so hurt I could only be fed by a spoon and with milk—I have not been able to attend to my business since—I have come from Rarasgate to attend this trial and am going to return there—I did not notice Kelly s face—I cannot say whether be is the man that joined the other Cross-examined by MR RIBTOK Q Does Mercer-street run into Long Acre A Yes in a line with White Lion-street it is in a straight line from Seven Dials—Mercer-street and Long Acre are separated by Castle-street—I crossed Castle-street—I suppose Mercer-street is 100 or 150 yards long from Long Acre I saw there was No 72 in the street—I followed the first man I did not see the other then—the first man was fifteen or twenty yards in front of me I walked up to him and overtook him—it had turned half-past 11 o clock—I had been from home about an hour and a half and had been to see a friend—I had had a wine-glass of spirit and water not more—that was a quarter of an hour before I got to White Lion-street—I had it with a friend at Mr Byrne s public-house it was then about half-past ten—I remained there it might be an hour—Mr Byrne is a prize-fighter—I had not supped at home—I left home about half-past nine and had had nothing to drink after my tea—it was a fine night it did not rain—I stopped to see a quarrel and fight between a man and his wife—I got a faint sight of Best s face before he said Squeeze him tight —when I recovered I saw Appleton smoking a pipe—he crossed over from the public-house he says he lifted me up but I do not know—he said something to me—I think he accompanied me to the station I know the policeman went—I was confined to my bed four or five days—I saw the prisoners about a week afterwards at Bow-street—the officer came to me every day to see how I was and he told me the men were to appear at Bow-street and I was to attend and give evidence against them—the gaoler brought them out of a back cell and brought them in front and I said that one was one of the men who attacked me but I could not swear to the other—I remarked Best s dress on the night of the robbery he seemed from his gait to be about thirty years of age—he had not got the action of a young sprightly man—he had a dark dress—I noticed no handkerchief about his face Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q How many houses are there in Mercer-street A I think I saw No 72 or 73—I should think it is 150 yards long—this happened from seventeen to twenty yards up the street on the left-hand side from Castle-street—Appleton came to my house three or four days afterwards or longer—he only came once—I have never been to his house—I do not know Long at all he has never been to my house MR PLATT Q You said you had a faint sight of Best s face was that while you were being pressed A I never saw his face until I was between the two—I had not a full view till he stooped his head to speak—I had not lost my senses then at all—it struck me that if I could only keep my watch somebody might come up before I was finished—I have no doubt Best is one of the men—I shall never forget him I had a full view of his face and saw his back before GEORGE APPLETON I am a labourer of No 11 Great St Andrew-street On 27th July I was in Long Acre about half-past 11 or 25 minutes to 12 o clock standing at the corner of Mercer-street—the prisoners came up from St Martin s-lane and turned down Mercer-street—when they got to the bottom of Mercer-street they stopped and looked round—I then saw Mr Day twelve or thirteen yards from me coming towards me and them into Mercer-street—he passed them and then they turned round and looked at him they followed him and he looked round—one went up on his right side and the other behind him—I saw them put their hands up and take hold of him by the neck—they both had hats on—they were about 100 yards from me up the street—they were some distance from the public-house at the corner—as they put their hands on him they all three went down together—the prisoners got up they walked some distance and then ran away down Castle-street towards St Martin s-lane—I went and found Mr Day lying on his back with his legs cocked up—his face looked quite black and tears were running down his cheeks he could not speak for about a minute—I helped him up and called for a policeman—two constables and a sergeant came and he complained of having been robbed of a watch and chain and described two men dressed in black—I knew the prisoners before they were put in gaol—I have known them thirteen or fourteen months—I used to see them every night at the Dials when I was in the police—I saw no other man in the street on this night—a man named Wallis was before the Magistrate and was discharged Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q How long had you been standing at the corner of Mercer-street A Not above three minutes it is more than 100 yards from one end of Mercer-street to the other I cannot say whether it is 200—at 12 o clock at night you can stand in Long Acre and see from the corner of Mercer-street through Castle-street and can see the police on the Dials—I did not speak to the men as they passed me—I had spoken to them before but I said nothing to them that night nor they to me—I stood looking at them it might be six or seven minutes—I was at the Long Acre corner of Mercer-street when I saw the gentleman coming into Mercer-street the prisoners were standing together in the middle of the street when he passed them as close as they are now or closer—Mr Day passed them about fifteen paces from them—he walked along the middle of the street up towards them and passed them—I should think he had got sixteen or twenty yards from them when the attack was made on him—he was on the pavement then not in the middle of the street—he went on to the pavement when he had passed them about ten yards—when I first saw Mr Day he was coming from Seven Dials into Mercer-street—he was crossing the square—I was about twenty yards from the prisoners when they were standing in the middle of the street—I was still standing at the corner of the street when they went up to Mr Day—they were then the whole distance of Mercer-street from me—they did not remain long on the ground when they fell—I did not begin to move till they got up and walked away then I hastened down and took Mr Day by the arm—there is a public-house near where he was about twenty yards round the corner—I had not been inside it—I was smoking my pipe—I did not go to the station till next day—the sergeant and two constables went after the prisoners in the direction I told them—I am a labourer—I was in the police about four months I left a month ago last Wednesday—before that I lived with a lady as gardener at Bishopstoke—I was there three weeks just doing the garden up I was an in-door servant—before that I was at work on the railway not as a navvy but keeping the roads in repair—I was there about two months I think but I do not know—I can give you my character—before I was on the railway I lived at home with my friends and worked for Mr Atkins a gentleman at Bishopstoke—I was dismissed from the police for drinking with a person that was the only reason I was dismissed—I should have gone home if this case had not kept me here—I have not tried to get back into the police—I do not expect to get back into the police if the prisoners are convicted I cannot swear I shall not go back—they have made me no offer—I did not mention the names of the two men I had seen because I had forgotten them but I described the men to sergeant Ashman Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q What were you doing A I was going home I had been to the police-station to see a man who was a mate of mine when I was in the police as I was going off home on Sunday—I went to him to advance me some money which he did as I could only have got it on the Wednesday which is our pay-day MR PLAIT Q When you saw them take hold of Mr Day and saw them all three fall together you were a considerable distance off A Yes above 100 yards and they appeared to be about ten yards in advance of him but I swear they were all three together when they went down—that was immediately after I saw them join each other RICHARD LONG I am a gold-lace manufacturer of 18 Mercer-street On 27th July a little before 12 o clock I was in my bedroom which is on the second-floor and looks into Mercer-street—I saw Mr Day coming down White Lion-street into Mercer-street—he passed my house on the same side of the way—he had crossed from White Lion-street I saw that—in about two minutes I saw the prisoners following him—they all three appeared close together—I saw Mr Day fall and the two men leaned over him they then got up and went away—there were two other men waiting for them on the opposite side who went away first and then the other two crossed the road and joined them and they all four ran away together—on seeing that I went out to Mr Day—he seemed in a great state of agitation tears were running down his eyes—I said Have you lost anything —he said Yes I have lost my watch —it was with great exertion that he was able to speak—I could see plainly there was a gaslight on each side of the street and a public-house with two burners in the bar-window and one in the tap-room—there was a lamp opposite the gateway where it took place—my bedroom window does not exceed twenty yards from the scene I have measured it— I can positively swear to Kelly but Best I only know by his external appear ance—I saw him distinctly Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q You were examined at the police-court A Yes I did not hear Appleton examined—I was outside being a witness I was excluded—Appleton has made no statement to me—he told me at the station what he had seen Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Which side of Mercer-street is your house going towards Long Acre A On the left it is the first door in the street coming from Seven Dials—this occurred eighteen or twenty yards higher up nearer Long Acre—my house is two stories high—I looked down on the scene—the next time I saw the men was at the station next evening—I think it was on the Monday evening or rather between 1 and 2 o clock in the morning for I was called out of bed by the policeman—he said there was a man there would I come down and see him and I went to the station and recognised him JAMES LEWIS ASHMAN police-sergeant F 1 I was on duty in Seven Dials on Sunday night 27th July a little before 12 o clock—I heard a very faint cry of Police which appeared to come from the end of Mercer-street—I ran to the spot with another constable and saw Mr Day reeling about in the middle of the street crying Police in a very faint way—he appeared very much excited and tears were running from his eyes—his face was rather discoloured—he seemed very much distressed and said he had been robbed and strangled—I was obliged to hold him up or he would have fallen—I took him to the station—I received information from Appleton that two men had gone round the corner dressed in dark clothes—I afterwards took Kelly Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Did Appleton tell you the names of the men A No he did not say he knew them MR PLATT Q Did he at any time mention the names to you A No I did not see him afterwards till I had got the parties into custody—he mentioned their names before the Magistrate when he gave evidence GEORGE DUNHAM policeman F 57 From information I received I took Best in Great St Andrew s-street Seven Dials—he had a black silk handkerchief round his head—he did not look as he does now—I told him I wanted him for robbing a man in Mercer-street on Sunday night—it was some little time before he answered me—he then said I have not been out of prison half a minute

of this robbery on the Tuesday after the Sunday on which it occurred—I believe it was the 27th I saw Best on that Sunday at 1 o clock in the day up in my place—he came up for his key to go to his own room—he said the doctor was coming to lance his face and he must go and get some hot water—my wife had looked after his wife while he was in prison as she was ill and she died on the Wednesday before as he came out on the Saturday—when he got his key he went to his own room—I went with him—he lit his fire and made some water hot and the doctor came and lanced his face and ordered him to put a linseed-meal poultice to it—he began to bathe his face—I remained with him till he tied his face up—he said he had to go out to dinner—I believe be did go—I saw him again at three—he came up for his key to go to his room again to put a fresh poultice to his face and be laid down till six in the evening—I then went up to his room and called him to come and have some tea at my place as we thought he must be rather lonesome—he came and had some tea and remained till a quarter before 11—he and I then went out together—we went to Mr Nolan s in Little St Andrew-street—Best said there was to be a meeting there but when we got there there was no such thing and we returned home again—he came home with me—he said he did not like to be out in the night-air with his face for fear of catching cold—he came into my house and remained there till half-past 12 we got break about five minutes past 11 he then went to bed and I took the caudle and left him—I am quite sure this was on the Sunday as

my mind by a gentleman outside—I do not know his name—it was a policeman—I asked him just now what day of the month last Sunday three weeks was—I had forgotten it—I knew it was Sunday three weeks but I did not know the day of the month—Best had a very large abscess on his cheek near the whisker—it was very bad indeed—I saw the doctor lance it—I do not know the doctor s name—he was not a very tall man or very short—I know it was half-past twelve that he went to bed—I have not got a clock but I went and asked the time—there is a clock in the room underneath mine Mr Smith s the landlord s—I did not look at the clock myself—Mr Brown the deputy-landlord told me it was half-past 12—I have never been in any trouble—I was never before a Magistrate except to be apprenticed to a chimneysweeper—I was never in gaol except to sweep the chimneys—my wife and a young woman who had attended on Best s wife were in the room with us—there was no other man there—I do not know the prisoner Kelly at all—I went to Bow-street at the last hearing but was not called in and said nothing at all about this MR RIBTON Q When did you hear of Best being taken A On the Tuesday—I am sure it was the Sunday before that that I am speaking of—I went to the police-court to tell what I knew of it but was not called—I do not know whether the prisoner had an attorney there—the handkerchief Best bad round his face was black with white stripes COURT Q What was the meeting you went out to go to A I cannot say—Best asked if I would go and I said yes—we did not go in—we met two young men who had been there and they said there was to be no meeting—we went up Charles-street across Drury-lane and through Short s-gardens and across the Seven Dials—we came back the same way—we left the two young men outside Nolan s house—it was a quarter to 11 o clock that we set out and 5 minutes after 11 when we got back—I only know the time by guess—we went straight there and back we did not stop anywhere and it would not

plaster on his face where it had been bad—it was very nearly healed up when he went out—it was not plumped up—I saw him the morning he was discharged—it could not have been very large then for there was a very small plaster on it I should say not the size of half-a-crown—I should say it did not then require poulticing it had been poulticed some time previous—I should say it did not require lancing—it was almost healed—it had no other treatment but plaster applied to it for some period previous to his discharge—he did not wear a handkerchief then—he wore a bandage in the early part of

the sergeant—he said I am not the man it was the pot-boy who tossed with you —I saw him by the water-side where a good many of these girls and men live together—constable took Battcock to the

lives with Stanes sister Eliza—it was then half-past 1 o clock—he was quite sober—he took out a pipe and asked me to give him a light—he went on towards Wandsworth and I went to Battersea—about half-past 3 I came back to the same spot and found a boot-lace and a constable with me found another—the ground was very much trampled about there as if there had been a scuffle THOMAS DALY

being so drunk as anybody might imagine that he knew what he was about—some prostitutes came up about a minute or two after I had got the prisoner in custody I noticed one woman in particular they told me she was a prostitute and that she had been frequently convicted of felony—the women did not say there were some men and women running across Bishopsgate-street and that the prisoner was not the party—they said there were some people running down Shoreditch—they did not say the prisoner was not the party—I paid no attention to what they said—I had got the prisoner in custody then—I had previously seen the prisoner in their company on several occasions—the prisoner turned to the right upon coming out of Primrose-street—the prosecutor was two or three paces after him close behind him—there were no persons near them COURT Q Do you say you had seen the prisoner in company with these women that came up and made that remark A Yes not on that night— I have seen them frequently as his companions in public-houses and out—they are his regular companions and associates I have seen them together perhaps nine or ten times a week—I do not recollect having seen them together that evening GUILTY ** Aged 21 — Transported for Seven Years

call a cab perhaps you would have done so—when these men came to me I had not my head bent down it was resting on my hand—before the men came close to me I had observed that there were two men coming towards me and one person following me—I had not seen them before I sat down on the step—I raised my head up in haste when these men came towards me—I had not some impression that they were acting as

Chesney came after me—Chesney threw his arm round my neck and another one from behind put his arm tightly round my throat and pressed my windpipe—I could not scream I was obliged to haw—they pressed me in that way that they almost took my breath—while this was doing Chesney was hitting me in the eye with his fist and every blow that he took fire flew from my eye—I suppose he struck me half a dozen times—with that they must have been disturbed—I had my hand on my watch which was in my right hand waistcoat pocket to hold it with both my hands—they tore the guard chain from my watch—they

to buy a box of lucifers of me—there were 500 in a box—they told me to run away home or they would give me in charge of a policeman—there was a policeman near the Sailor s Home and then seeing him they let the old gentleman pass them by—I went to a pair of large doors and hid myself—it was before he passed the Cock and Neptune that these men went and looked at him—it was up in the square a lonesome place very dark—I hid myself and watched and I saw Carr put his arm round his neck to choke him and Chesney hit him in the eye—I saw Swanton there—he took hold of Mr Jewill s coat to pull him back—a gentleman and lady were coming down the street and they disturbed these men and they chucked the old gentleman down on the ground and ran away—before they threw him down there were four men and

young man named Green—we had been at the beershop an hour or an hour and a half—it wanted 10 minutes to 12 by Mr Salter s clock when the potman said it was time to go and our beer was gone and we went—I should think it is half a mile from the Cock and Neptune to Back Church-lane—I saw this boy Sullivan down below—I did not speak to him no one did in my presence—none of the women did in my presence—I can swear that—I have seen no one—I did not put my fist in his face and say I would serve him out—I did not see any one do it—I did not hold my fist up at him at all JOHN WILLIAMS I live at No 7 Gower s-row Whitechapel The last witness is a lodger of mine—he goes by the name of Robert I do not know his other name—I know Chesney—I know he was taken up—I know he came to my house on the night before on the night of the 18th and went up to bed before the clock struck 12—I observed he was just in time—I cannot say that I saw him in the morning—he sleeps in the one pair room with four other men five altogether—I sleep down-stairs myself so that no one can come in or go out without my seeing them—there is not a passage the door comes in the room from the street—they go through the room in which I live the lower room—if he had gone out after I went to bed he must have come through my room—I never let any one out after I go to bed—I put the key in my pocket—I am the first up in the morning—I unlock the door—I did so that morning—the door was locked when I unlocked it in the morning—I unlocked them both—there is a kitchen at the bottom of the garden—my room does not open into any other room—there are steps from the stairs that go out in the yard Cross-examined Q How many persons lodge in your house A Eighteen five in one room four in another and there is a room for married people three couples sleep there—I do not require to see the marriage certificate—my lodgers are mostly men that work in the Docks—I have heard that Chesney is a person that drives a van—I never saw him do so—when a person goes out at 6 o clock in the morning and comes in at 12 o clock at night I never inquire about him Q Who came home with Chesney that night A Gosnell nobody else he came in and went straight up to bed—he was taken the next day—I did not go before the Magistrate—the officer came to my house and asked me the description of the person—I said there was such a person lived there and he was in bed the night before—I cannot say that I saw him go away on Sunday morning after I unlocked the door those that sleep in the house go out what time they think fit—my wife sleeps in the room with me and all the persons pass my room to go out—they all sleep upstairs—Chesney had not a wife—four single men and himself sleep in that room COURT Q Then there were four other persons slept in that room A Yes Robert and Chesney that was two—the other three are not here—one was named Watson one James and the other Wilson nobody else—Chesney and Gosnell came in together—there was nobody with them Q Was there a man of the name of Green slept in that room A Yes there was Green Q Why did not you mention that before you told me there were only five before were there six slept in that room A No yes there were six that night—Green slept there in one end of the room Q Will you undertake to swear that Green did not come in with them A I only saw Robert and Chesney come in together Q If Robert has said that Green came in with them that is not truth is it A I cannot say that I saw the third one come in he might have come in before—I made an observation to him that he was just in time—he was as late as he could be—I have not been in company with the other witnesses outside there is none that I know—I did not hear anything pass with that boy Sullivan—I did not hear any of the women speak to him MR PAYNE to JOHN SULLIVAN Q Do you recollect Ann Farrell saying anything to you down below A Yes she swore that she would have my life if they got anything done to—there were two other women with her one had a black eye—I saw the man Gosnell and another man down below—they said they would have the boy or else the policeman would have their life—Gosnell held his hand up—the

RICHARD WILLIS Q In this deposition Carr says he was awoke up at 2 o clock and then he went and saw Swanton did he come and see Swanton A I swear he did not come into my house that night—he came the

Princes-street Portman-market On the evening of Friday 7th Jan I was coming out of my door about half past 9 o clock or a quarter to 10 I saw the two prisoners carrying the prosecutor or rather dragging him along—one was on each side of him—one had hold of each arm and directly they got opposite my door they threw him down on his head—the prisoner Atkinson snatched his watch from his pocket and they both instantly ran off I ran after them—they both ran in the same direction—I followed Atkinson for about 150 yards the constable took him—I pointed him out to the constable and told the constable that he had knocked a man down and robbed him of his watch—I said that in Atkinson s presence—I saw no more of Goddard that night—I went back to the man whom I had seen knocked down—I had not known the prosecutor before—he was rather the worse for liquor—he was not on the ground when I went back he was when I left him but when I went back some one had picked him up—I observed his watch guard was hanging about him Goddard I was not with this man at all there was another man given into custody and he swore he was the man Witness No there was a man taken on the Monday evening I went and I said that was not the man Goddard I was looking in the fire when he came in and he said as soon as he came in that I was the man before he saw my face THOMAS RELIN On the evening of Friday 7th Jan I happened to be in Princes-street near Port man-square about a quarter before 10 o clock—I saw Atkinson and another man knock Mr Cole down and they ran away—I did not pursue them—I had not known Atkinson before—I am sure it was him—I was about 100 yards from him—I saw his face—he turned round and there was a lamp I could swear to a man at that distance that I never saw before COURT Q How much is 100 yards A As far as across this Court ROBERT DOBLE policeman D 237 On the evening when this matter occurred I was in Salisbury-street which leads out of Princes-street I heard a cry of Stop thief and saw the two prisoners running away I pursued Atkinson and took him—the other prisoner turned in a different direction—as soon as I took Atkinson he said I have not got it —I had not then said anything to him about what it was for I did not know—at that time Day came up and said that he and another man had knocked a man down and robbed him of a watch JOHN COLE I am a French polisher and live in John-street Portlandtown On the evening of 7th Jan I had a watch in my pocket I know I had it safe when these persons came up to me and threw me down—I had it when they were with me—I had been to a party that evening and was going home and these persons saw my chain hanging down and one of them pushed me further from the pavement and took my watch and left the chain hanging down—the policeman has got the chain now—I was insensible when the policeman took me up—I was aware I lost it at the time I was not so far gone as that Goddard He said he saw his watch about a quarter to 8 o clock Witness No I had it at 8 o clock and I might have had it at past 8 o clock I know I had it in my pocket and the chain was banging down—if I had put it in this would not have happened—I cannot swear to the men JOSEPH LACK policeman D 156 On 12th Jan I took Goddard—I had heard of this robbery but I could not find him before—I said to him I want you for being concerned with Atkinson in robbing a man of his watch last Friday evening —he said I know nothing about it I was not with Atkinson that night at all —he said he was at work—he did not say where —I had seen him and Atkinson together on the night of 7th Jan in Churchstreet Portman-market between 6 and 7 o clock which is about 150 or 200 yards from where this robbery occurred COURT Q Had you known Goddard before A I knew both the prisoners well—I have known Goddard about two years and Atkinson about the same time—I cannot be mistaken about having seen them that night BENJAMIN EASON policeman A 352 On the evening of 7th Jan I was on duty in Salisbury-street which runs through Princes-street about a quarter to 10 o clock—I saw the prisoners running along—they came out of Princes-street and turned down

t18530228-423  423 ROBERT WILLIAMS was indicted for a robbery with others unknown on Thomas Smith and stealing from his person 18l 10s in money I purse and 2 keys value 1s 2d his goods Mr METCALFE conducted the Prosecution THOMAS SMITH I am a butcher at No 6 Acre-lane Brixton On Thursday 27th Jan at a few minutes past 8 o clock in the evening as I was going along Brighton-terrace which is a turning out of the Brixton-road I was overtaken and accosted by a female who asked me if I knew of a Dr Wallis living in that neighbourhood—I told her I knew no such person and she asked me some other question relative to a singing master who I knew nothing about—I then walked on some few yards past a customer s in Brighton-terrace where I was going to and then stopped—I was in the act of naming to her that there were some fresh families in a square just above where she might probably find the person she was in search of and at that moment the prisoner was stepping across the road towards where I was standing—there were the usual quantity of gas lamps about one on each side of the road about every thirty-five or forty yards—the prisoner came up to me and said You d—d villain or some words to that effect you have insulted that woman —before I could make any reply he struck me a violent blow on the front of the face and knocked me down from the effect of the blow and the alarm I was insensible for some short time—on coming to myself I found myself lying on my right side and saw the woman standing over me—I immediately got up and saw the prisoner and another man going across the road I had seen the other man following in the prisoner s wake as he came up to me before he struck me—when I got up the woman had got hold of me by the collar and the cuff of the coat—I immediately disengaged myself from her and ran after the prisoner and his companion they were then going down Brighton-terrace again towards the Brixton-road Brighton-terrace leads through a square and turning to the left leads near to Acre-lane it was formerly closed at the end but lately has been made a thoroughfare—when I first saw the prisoner he appeared to have been up the terrace and was coming back towards me meeting me and the woman in an opposite direction—I pursued the prisoner and the other man—I passed the other man who was the shorter of the two and came up with the prisoner he was just in the act of passing a lamp between him and me—I put my hand against him on the right side and said You thief you have got my purse —I then saw his face very plainly there was a lamp directly behind me—the light was clear upon his face I saw his countenance as clearly and distinctly as I see it now—he said to me Me I never saw you before in my life —he then turned up to where I had left his companion and they both ran away together towards where the woman was left back up to Brighton-terrace—they were the only persons I saw in Brighton-terrace—I pursued them crying Police Stop thief very many times until I brought out many of the neighbours on both sides of me I pursued them up the terrace to a field at the top where they made their escape—they went over into the field I am quite sure the prisoner is one of the persons who went into the field—I immediately ran back picked up my hat and umbrella and went to the station-house which did not take me more than two minutes—I got two policemen and went with them to Shepherd s-lane which leads to the field where I saw the men go in it is no thoroughfare I believe—we walked about thirty or forty yards up the lane and met the prisoner coming down the lane from the direction of the field—directly I got to him I said That is the man that knocked me down this was not more than five minutes after I saw him go into the field—supposing him to have been the same person he would have had to travel across the field about 300 yards and down the lane—I told the policemen that was the man who knocked me down and the prisoner said Me I never saw you before in my life —I said So you told me before I then gave him in charge—there is a light at the end of the lane where we found him I do not believe the lights go all the way up the lane but they do at that end—the policemen asked what business he had there he said he had been to the Exhibition meaning the New Crystal Palace looking for work and had lost his way—the lane is not a place that could be taken for the high road it is a narrow lane with no thoroughfare—he said he was a stranger in London and had only been three weeks from Manchester—this is my purse produced it was made by my daughter—I had it in my pocket when I was first accosted I had not been out of my own house three minutes—it contained two 5l Bank of England notes and either 8l 10s or 9l 10s in gold which was all gone when the purse was recovered—I missed my purse immediately on recovering my legs after being knocked down—a man found the purse next morning in Acre-lane just by my own house I saw it afterwards before the Magistrate Cross-examined by Mr PARRY Q I believe you had never seen this person before A Not to my knowledge—I saw two persons standing at the corner of Acre-lane when I passed but I cannot undertake to say that the prisoner was one of them—I was knocked down a very short time after the prisoner came up to me—it could not have been a very long time—when I recovered myself the two men were just going from me and were about fifteen yards off—they were just in the act of passing—they might have been the distance off me of one length and a half of this Court—it was not by any means a dark place there was a gas lamp about as far from me as to the corner of this Court directly behind—I speak to the prisoner without any doubt—when I recovered from the fall I saw the prisoner and the other man about the distance and a half of this Court—I got up and followed them—when I met the prisoner again he was coming towards me but before that I had seen his face distinctly—he turned round and looked at me as he was on the kerb and I in the gutter—I had not lost sight of either of the men before that only for a very short time while I was insensible while they were robbing me—the field into which they went lies on the right of the Brixton-road—it is not usually crossed by passengers—people who do cross it are considered trespassers—there is no footpath across it there may be a track—there is a fence to get over—having got into the field the only outlet is where I met the prisoner—I do not think a person would go across that field going from the Crystal Palace to London—the City Reform Almshouses are situated in that field—tradespeople s boys may go over the fence as a near cut to the almshouses—it is not a near cut into Acre-lane and to Camberwell Mr METCALFE Q Just tell me about these two persons you saw in Acre-lane A As I was leaving my own residence I saw two persons standing on my right at the corner of Acre-lane and there was one man on the left whom I knew—he was not one of the men I afterwards saw—that is twenty-five yards from the corner of Brighton-terrace—about a minute and a a half after I passed the two men the woman spoke to me—it might have been perhaps three or four minutes after I passed the men that I was struck—my impression was that it was the same two men although I cannot swear they were both dressed in dark brown coats JURY Q Had you been drinking at all A No I do not think I had taken any beer or spirits all day—I was perfectly sober I was going out on business JOHN CHIVERS I am the pew-opener at Brixton Church On 27th Jan about 8 o clock I was at the corner of Acre-lane and there saw the prisoner and another man and woman in company together—I am quite sure the prisoner was one of them—they were walking to and fro from Brighton-terrace to the corner of Acre-lane—I saw Mr Smith go down the corner of Brighton-terrace—I then missed these men and woman suddenly—I had seen them immediately before Mr Smith went down the terrace—I saw the prisoner s face I am positive of him—there is a large linendraper s shop where I was standing it was well lighted Cross-examined by Mr RIBTON Q What sort of light was it A Gas-light—it was an open shop—there was light from the shop and the street likewise—they were walking on the footpath—there was an omnibus standing there and a great many persons passing and repassing ROBERT HODDER policeman P 10 On 27th Jan about half past 8 o clock Mr Smith came to the station and in consequence of what he said I went with him to Shepherd s-lane coming down which we met the prisoner coming in an opposite direction to the Brixton-road—that is no thoroughfare—immediately Mr Smith saw him he said That is the man who knocked me down —the prisoner said Me I never saw you before in my life —he said he was on his way from the Great Exhibition at Norwood where he had been looking for work—he said he lived at Nightingale-lane Paddington—I have made inquiries and cannot find such a place Cross-examined Q Paddington is a very large place A It is I did not look in the Directory—persons never go across this field not unless they trespass—I am not aware they are in the habit of doing so—this lane leads to the Brixton-road MICHAEL WOOD I am a carman and live at Brixton On 28th Jan a little before 8 o clock in the morning I picked up this purse—it was lying by the side of the road in Acre-lane just where the road leads out from Brighton-terrace about twenty yards from Brighton-terrace—it was empty as it is now THOMAS SMITH re-examined I had the purse in my left trowsers pocket—I was too much stunned to feel what was done to me—when I came to myself I was on my knee and elbow on my side and the woman had hold of me by the collar with one arm and by the left arm with the other—she clung to the cuff of my coat and said Oh good God what is the matter what is the matter pray don t leave me —I said Oh you hussey you know very well what s the matter —she tried to detain me in that way GUILTY The prisoner was further charged with having been before convicted MARK LOOME police sergeant B 11 I have known the prisoner eight or nine years—was present when he was tried with two others in Nov 1849 in the Third Court for stealing a watch and other articles in a dwelling house—he had twelvemonths

t18530815-915  915 JOSEPH DUNN was indicted for a robbery with two other persons on John Travers and stealing 3l his moneys JOHN TRAVERS I have been a draper but am now out of business On Monday afternoon 11th July about a quarter past 2 o clock I was in the neighbourhood of the Regent s-park near the New Church of St Mark in the Albert-road—I had been to have my dinner and as I was coming from the coffee house I was separating my money in my hand when all at once I was startled by somebody holding my arms from behind—I had not seen them before for my eyes were directed to my hand as I was counting my money—it is a very quiet place—I found somebody lay hold of my arms behind and pinion me—I then looked and saw that two men were holding my arms—they pulled me on about three yards from the place where they had first seized me and then directed my eyes to the prisoner who was kneeling on the ground shuffling some cards—they asked me to lay a stake—I refused to do so—they said they were betting and wanted me to do the same—I was held all the time—one of them said I bet 5s that I pick up the middle card —I do not remember that he said what the card was—all this time I was in the custody of the two men and trying to get away as well is I could but I was alarmed—I had my money grasped in my hand for as soon as I felt them lay hold of my elbow I grasped my money and tried to put it into my pocket but was not able to do to—I had half a sovereign with four half crowns in my left hand and two sovereigns in my right hand which I had taken from the other and was about putting it into my pocket—I was in the act of separating the gold from the silver when I was first attacked—the man at the left hand side seized hold of my hand and took from it the money that was in it 5s of which he gave to the prisoner and the other he put into his waistcoat pocket and about a second afterwards he took it out again and gave that also to the prisoner—I saw the prisoner take the 5s —he was only about a yard from me at the time he was in front of me—I did not see how many persons there were behind me—I did not look behind I kept my eye on the prisoner because I knew he had got the 5s —I was pinioned all the time that was why I could not resist them—two persons held me one on each side—there seemed to be three of the party one on my right hand one on my left and the other who was betting or pretending to bet—about a second after the man on my left took the money from my left hand the man on the right side of me seized hold of my wrist and forcibly took the two sovereigns out of that hand and gave it to the prisoner—he put it on the ground pretending that it was in my name whereas it was nothing of the sort—I was then released—I immediately sprang at the prisoner who was attempting to get on his feet shuffling the cards all the time—he was then knocked down by a man who was not in a policeman s clothes but who at once said I am a constable and you are my prisoner and he took the prisoner into custody—when J first saw the prisoner he was kneeling down—I did not see him before I was pinioned—while the two men held me they talked to the prisoner it was very confused I could scarcely repeat what they said save that Here is a 5s bet I bet you 5s that I take up that card that is all that I can remember—they appeared to be rapidly betting with each other and seemed to be quite confused with it or quite busily engaged with it—the prisoner dealt the cards on the ground—he turned up certain cards but I have no idea what they were I suppose it was the one they were pretending to bet upon—I said nothing to the prisoner only Give me my money —I said that as soon as I was released and I made a dash at him to get my money—as soon as he had the 2l I was released and I sprang at his hands as he was getting on his feet and said Give me my money when I was interrupted by the policeman knocking him down—I did not consent to the money being taken from me it was taken forcibly from my hand—it occupied about two minutes and a half Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q What situation are you in now A In a situation as clerk—I was a clerk some time at Sheffield after I gave up business—I have been out of business about two or three months—I was not in business on my own account—it is two months since I was in a situation—the last employment I was in was at Sheffield—that is about eight months ago—I have not been out of employment since then—I was in a situation three months ago with Lewis and Allenby of Regent-street—I left from a private cause of my own and I have re-engaged with them and am going there very shortly—I have never represented myself as a clergyman or as a gentleman studying for holy orders—I was contemplating going to College you have got hold of that idea from Mr Hough who was solicitor to my Society and he elicited that from me—I did not tell Mr Hough that I had been foolishly gambling and had lost more than I could afford to lose with these persons—I deny it on my oath—I never said such a thing to him or any one else—I do not know how to play at cards—I never touched a card in my life—I was not playing at cards with these people—there were 31 three persons beside the prisoner—it lasted about two minutes and a half—I had not left the house where I dined two seconds—there are not houses on each side in the Albert-road only on one side—they are very nice detached houses and on the other side is the Zoological Gardens—these three persons had not been in the coffee-house—when I came out of the coffee-house I was quite alone—I had seen no person and when I felt myself arrested I was in the middle of the road—I supposed that they had come from the park—there were three persons besides myself four altogether—they remained there till the policeman rushed up—there were three persons and the prisoner four besides myself including the prisoner—one had hold of my left arm another of my right another stood by the side of the one that had hold of my right arm and he had a moustache from what I can recollect and the prisoner was on the ground at that time—there were five persons altogether including the prisoner and myself—that was all I saw as I said before I could not see behind me—only two persons seized me by the arms—the others were at the side of the road when I got there—the wall of the nearest house was about six yards off—it was a detached house at the corner—the prisoner was kneeling I was standing—I was not on the ground I was on my legs and trying to get away—I could not call out—I have an affection of the throat and the least excitement will hinder me from speaking or shouting—I said Leave me alone —I did not call out for assistance—I could not as I was suffering from the affection of the throat COURT Q You have been asked about Mr Hough is he the prisoner s attorney A Yes I did not know him before this matter took place—I was introduced to him at the police court by the reporter for the Times—I did not seek the introduction—the Times reporter came to me and asked if my case was coming on and he said This is the attorney for the prosecution—I said Indeed I understood that the Crown was the prosecutor and I a witness for the Crown —he told me he was the attorney for the client that is the prisoner—they went through the yard and the Times reporter made a motion to me to follow—I went and we talked a little in a room and in the course of conversation I said if I were to consult my own feelings I should not prosecute the man at all it would be ill in accordance with my views as I expected one day to be a minister JAMES ABRAHAMS policeman S 296 I took the prisoner into custody about half past 2 o clock on this Monday afternoon at the corner of Albert-road Regent s-park—as I turned round the corner I saw him and two others of his companions in among a crowd of I suppose fourteen or fifteen persons—I then saw the prisoner on his knees on the public footpath and before him he had these three cards producing them —they were on the ground before I got up—I then saw some silver passed to the prisoner but whose hand gave it to him I could not swear—I believe it was one of his companions—I saw the hand go immediately I came up—I saw the prosecutor there he did not appear to be betting at all—I afterwards saw one of the prisoners companions take from the prosecutor s hand two or three sovereigns—I saw that done—I was looking over a man s shoulder just round the corner—I was in plain clothes—I kept out of sight—I knew very well as soon as they saw me they would not stay—the man who took the sovereigns gave them to the prisoner—the prosecutor was in the act of laying hold of him and I immediately came forward got hold of him and threw him on his back on the footpath and whilst I was in the act of picking up these three cards some person struck me and knocked me up against the wall—I then immediately put my foot on the prisoner s chest and kept him down on the ground—I picked up the cards and then said Give me the money you have got in your hand —he made no reply hut I took from his hand as I thought four sovereigns in gold and 17s 6d in silver hut one of the four is a counterfeit sovereign—I took hold of him by the collar and told him to come with me—I pulled him across the road into the Regent s-park on account of there being so many there and then I called a park-keeper—as we got into the park he said Give the gentleman the three sovereigns and let me go and I will give you something or make you amends or you shall lose nothing by it or something like that—as we were going to the station he dropped these ten other cards on the footpath—they came from the bottom of his trowsers—I searched him at the station and found on him 7s 6d besides what I took from his hand and a piece of paper which I have lost Cross-examined Q You say there were thirteen or fourteen persons there altogether A I should say about that—when I first saw the prosecutor to the best of my belief his face was towards the footpath as if he was going over the bridge—he was not standing alone the prisoner s companions were one on each side of him—I never heard him bet or speak one way or the other till just as I was going to take the prisoner when I told him I was a policeman—I suppose it might be not quite a minute from the time I saw the money taken out of the prosecutor s hand till I took the prisoner I seized him directly—there were more gentlemen there besides the prosecutor—there was a quantity of people there—I stated before the Magistrate that there was a gentleman there I meant the prosecutor but there were other gentlemen besides him Q You stated in your depositions there was a gentleman as I thought in the act of betting some money to whom did you refer A Not to the prosecutor he was not in the act of betting as I told you before I never heard him speak a word I referred to another gentleman—I could see the prosecutor distinctly and the persons on each side of him it seemed to me as if they both had hold of him COURT Q I find that before the Magistrate you made this statement There was a gentleman as I thought in the act of betting some money and I saw him give the prisoner one or two half crowns A Yes that was what I stated I saw some silver go to the prisoner—that gentleman was a person who was standing behind he did not interfere at all with the prosecutor—no sooner were the half crowns given than the prosecutor s Other hand was wrenched open and two or three sovereigns taken from him and given to the prisoner and the instant they were given I laid hold of him by the collar the others immediately ran away—I cannot say whether the person I call a gentleman was a confederate of the others BENJAMIN BISHOP Between 2 and 3 o clock on this Monday afternoon I was passing near St Mark s Church and saw from ten to fourteen persons standing round—I went up to them and saw the prisoner kneeling down on one knee with three cards on the pavement in front of him—I saw the prosecutor standing in the middle of two men right opposite the prisoner they had got hold of his arms one on each side—the prisoner said Will you have a bet at first he said for one sovereign and then he altered it to two—the betting was to be upon picking a card out of the three I believe it was the Queen that was to be picked out the gentleman was to pick the card but he never offered to bet—I saw the prisoner shuffle the cards—I saw a man who was standing by the side of the prosecutor take some money from the prosecutor s hand—it was not done in a very rash way the prosecutor s hand was closed the man pulled it open took out the money and gave it to the prisoner be took it I believe it was 2l I am not certain I saw it was gold—the officer was standing behind me all the time looking over my shoulder—as soon as this was done he rushed by me and took the prisoner into custody—the prosecutor said You thief you hare got my money—the other two ran away nobody tried to catch them—I accompanied the prisoner part of the way to the station—he said I have a large family I was trying to get some bread for them let me go Cross-examined Q They did not carry on this game in a very quiet manner did they A There was very little talking only with the three—I did not hear one of them say to the prosecutor Why you have lost it fairly and you must pay nothing of the kind GUILTY Aged 20 — Transported for Ten Years

to go out—I do not know whether it was a bed or a cot that was in the room—I did not look at it—I was not lying down on it with the woman—I bolted the door by her order I thought she might be going to put her shawl on—I bolted it to keep it shut I suppose—when I left home I had 20s in one pocket—there was a 5s piece and the rest shillings and sixpences in my left hand pocket—I carried the watch in my trowsers pocket—the man prisoner had his elbow on my throat—I could not holloa for assistance—my waistcoat was broken open—it was unbuttoned—my braces were not unbuttoned—I did not undo my braces myself—I had a sailor s jacket on—I have been to sea—when my waistcoat was undone my gold chain was to be seen—it is a alight chain—this woman and I bad not an altercation about a sixpence—that was

lying on the pavement and was still crying Police when I got up to him—it was a stifling cry as if some one bad their hand over his mouth—when I got about three or four yards from them they got up and

WAY conducted the Prosecution RICHARD EDWARD FELSTEAD I am thirteen years old I live at No 26 Merlin-place Wilmington-square I am errand boy to Charles Hawkins a watch gilder in Perceval-street On 14th Oct I was sent out by my master with some work about ten minutes before 8 o clock—I went to Powell-street west and delivered some work all right—I had some move and as I went to deliver the other work I saw the prisoner at the corner of President-street—from there you can see into Powell-street—if the prisoner had watched he could see where I went to—he spoke to me and asked me to tell him where Mr Johnson the dial painter lived—I told him I did not know—I was alone at that time—another boy then came up who had come out of our place—he asked him the same question and he did not know—the other boy went in another direction and I was going on and the prisoner called me back and asked me to go to the corner of Powell-street with him—he said Come with me to the corner —when we got there he said See what number that is —I looked and said No 49 —he said Knock at the door I think he lives there —I stood up to knock and he hit me suddenly on the top of the head—I had this cap on—he knocked me to the ground—it was a hard blow it stunned me for the moment—I had my bag containing the goods I had to deliver—the string of the bag was round my neck and the bag was tied in my apron strings round my waist—the prisoner forced the bag off my head—I did not feel anything as he was getting it off—I did not know where I was till I saw him at the corner of Powell-street—I got up and ran after him and called Stop thief —I saw he had my bag with him when he turned—I do not know what became of it—I did not see him stopped—I had just turned the corner and two gentlemen had stopped him—when he turned into Powell-street I lost sight of him—I turned into Powell-street—I saw him again—he turned the corner to go up Goswell-street—he was running COURT Q How for is it from the corner of Powell-street to Goswell-street A About sixty yards—I continued to cry out—I lost sight of him when he turned into Goswell-street—I ran up Goswell-street—from the place where I lost sight of him to the place where I saw him in custody is about 100 yards—I had the bag given me by some one—this is it—it contained watch materials Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Had you ever seen the prisoner before A No I know the other boy s name is Cark—he came out of our place and joined me about three minutes after the prisoner spoke to me—he walked on with me and the prisoner walked on with us—the blow did not cut my head—I was stunned and was insensible about three minutes—I fell down and shortly afterwards recovered myself—when I got up the prisoner was in sight just at the corner going into Powell-street—he was then about sixty yards from me—I could see that distance—there was a lamp alight—I saw my bag in his hand—it was a blue bag—I saw no one else running—I found two gentlemen had taken him—there are a great number of little streets about there COURT Q Was there any lump on your head A Yes about the size of a walnut just on the top of my head—I did not see whether the prisoner had got anything in his hand ARTHUR GENGE I live at No 21 St John-street Clerkenwell and am a tailor On 14th Oct about 8 o clock I was at the corner of Upper Charles-street leading into Goswell-road—I heard a cry of Stop thief and Murder and There he goes —I saw the prisoner coming from Powell-street west running fast and crying Stop thief —he had something like a bag in his hand and as he got further into the road he threw it away-followed him and never lost sight of him till I caught him by his right hand collar—I came up to him at the same time as another man did—I saw the constable arrive from President-street—I saw the boy come up just after the constable had got hold of the prisoner s collar—the boy was crying for his master s bag and property—he laid hold of the prisoner directly he came up—he was very much frightened—this is such a bag as I saw the prisoner throw away Cross-examined Q What distance were yen from him when he threw it away A As near as I am to you—I did not see anything of it after he threw it away till a gentleman brought it up just after the boy arrived—when the constable came up I said to him You lay hold of him you will soon hear what it is about —I am quite sure I saw the prisoner throw away a bag very much resembling this—I could not swear it was this bag—it was something in the shape of a bag—I can swear it was not a mere motion of his arm—both his hands went together—I saw a bag go out of his hand WILLIAM MARSHALL I live in William-street Peter-street and am a watch engraver On the night of 14th Got I was standing three or four yards up Powell-street west—when I had been there a minute and a halt or two minutes I heard a child halloo Stop thief —I thought it was some boys at play in the square—presently the prisoner came running along on the opposite side to me—I crossed the way and followed him—as he passed me I saw he had something in his left hand—I could not tell exactly what it was but when I saw this bag I could tell it was most likely to be that—it was something dark—the prisoner hallooed Stop thief himself but no one had passed there before the prisoner for a minute and a half before—I followed close behind him and saw something fall in Gosfwell-road—I kept up close with the prisoner and saw him caught by two or three persons altogether at the corner of President-street—the boy came up and instantly said That is the man and cried for his master s work GUILTY Aged 20 — Transported for Fifteen Years The Court directed that the witnesses Felstead Genge and Marshall should receive 40s each 
t18561124-87  87 CHARLES HUNTER and THOMAS MURTY were indicted for a robbery with violence in company with two other persons on Edward Mason and stealing 1 tobacco pipe and case value 1s his goods MR W J PAYNE conducted the Prosecution EDWARD MASON I live at No 6 Oxford-terrace Clapham-road I am a banker s clerk On Wednesday 29th Oct about a quarter past one in the morning I was in High-street Borough—I was on the left hand side of the way going towards the Elephant and Castle on the same side as St George s Church—when I got to Stone s End I saw the prisoner Hunter come out of a court—he bent his head down underneath the gas lamp and looked at me and I did the same and did not like his appearance—he was alone—I attempted to step into the road to pass him when I felt a spring from behind and was immediately seized by the throat from behind before I could get into the road—I was walking very fast at the time and when I was seized I had got within arm s length of Hunter—he was walking across me—he stopped when I was seized and he immediately seized me by the right arm—another seized me by the left—I had a loose coat on at the time with a pocket at the side and he seized my pipe case from it—I believe Hunter must have done that he being on that side of me—I received a bruise at the time from the violence—he seized me by the arm and seized the pipe case out of my pocket—I was then held by the arm after being seized by the hand by a third man—I struggled with them and they held up my over coat and put their hands in my wowsers I do not wear braces so they could not get their hands into my pockets but they undid all the buttons and pulled out my shirt and after that they said Quick —I could not say which of them it was that said that some of them did—they looked round and cried out Quick and then I saw the prisoner Murty for the first time—they tore open my over coat while he tried to unbutton the under one which was closely buttoned up—I kicked him as hard as I could on the legs—they then said Squeeze him tighter and that was the last I recollect—they all opened away from me when I kicked—the man behind still had hold of my throat at that time—I was calling out as well as I could but of course I could not call out I was only gurgling in my throat—I tried to throw the man behind—I could hardly move while I was held by the three but I kicked the fourth one when he came to unbutton my under coat and that startled them—after they said Squeeze him tighter I became insensible—I scrambled up as well as I could and I saw the policeman running after three and I ran as well—I felt very unwell and went home—I had been in bed about half an hour when the policeman came to fetch me and I gave him a description of Hunter in the hall and I also gave a description of two other men—Murty is one of them—Hunter was brought to me I should think within an hour it might have been an hour and a half—all the property I lost was my pipe case—I was very much hurt—I have a lump in my throat at the present time—my stomach was almost beaten to a jelly from the way in which they used me and I have a large bruise on my left breast—I have had a great dizziness in my head ever since Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH for Hwnier Q I suppose this outrage upon you was all the work of a minute A I should say about a minute I could not judge of the time—it was about a quarter past 1 o clock—it had struck 1 o clock as I walked over London Bridge—it was foggy but I could see clearly across the road—when the officer came to me he said You must go with me to the police station we have one of your men —he did not describe the man—I said I was very much hurt and I would rather not go that night—he said We dare not detain him till the morning we have no doubt he is one of the men —I said I will tell you what the man is like and I told him—when I went to the station Hunter was locked up in a cell—I believe he was brought out by a policeman into the room where I was and I was asked if that was the man—but before they could get him into the office I recognised him because his appearance is so ferocious looking—directly I saw him in the street I started and would not have passed him at that time of night Cross-examined by MR METCALFE for Mwrty Q You did not see Murty in custody till about ten days afterwards I believe A No—I was then fetched to the police station to see him—I saw him in the same way as I had seen Hunter—the first time I saw him I said I could swear to him—before the Magistrate I had my doubts about him but now I believe he is the man—I will swear to him—I saw him first on the Saturday night about 9 o clock—that was by gaslight—I saw him before the Magistrate on the Monday—that was by daylight—I had never seen him from the time I was robbed until he was in custody—I am quite sure about that—I went to a public house kept by a person named Harris near the Surrey Theatre—I went to several public houses one night with a man in plain clothes to see if I could see the men—that may have been about a week after the robbery—I saw a person called Bill the carrier—he was brought out of the public house for me to see I went in five times previously to look at him—Murty was not in that public house at that time because I went and looked at the men five times—he was not standing outside the house there were only two or three women there who had been turned out—there were two policemen with me one in plain clothes and one in uniform—I will swear that I did not see Murty in the house he may have been hid in another room—I believe Murty to be the fourth man the one who came up to me after my pockets were rifled and immediately before I was insensible MR W J PAYNE Q At the time you saw Murty had you your senses about you A Yes I had and I gave him four or five good kicks as violently as I could being forced down towards the ground I should think they took effect on his legs from his starting back so quickly as he did—there was a gas lamp exactly near the place and in the struggle I was carried across so that the light shone on the face of the men—I was carried some two yards in the struggle—I was certain of Hunter directly I saw him—I am certain of both of them—the more I look at Murty the more I believe him to be the man and I swear to him but there is a great difference between gaslight and daylight JOHN SMITH policeman A 480 On the morning of 29th Oct about 1 o clock I was on duty near Stone s-and in the Borough—I heard a noise on the opposite side from the Ship public house a scraping of feet and scuffling about on the pavement—I went across very gently and when I got within about two yards of the kerb some one ran away from a something that I saw lying on the pavement—the person that ran away had a cap on and a pair of light trowsers—I saw him very clearly because he had to run past me—I had a full view of him it was the prisoner Hunter—he went into Trinity-street—I followed him very closely and called out Stop thief two or three times—I lost sight of him when he got to the corner because he was some distance before me and he turned sharply round the corner of Trinity-street—I followed him down Trinity-street—I cried Stop thief in Trinity-square three or four times after springing my rattle and I heard the constable Armstead say Come on I have got him —he might have been 100 or 200 yards off at that time—I went straight up to him and found Hunter struggling in his arms—we brought him back to the spot where I had seen something lying on the ground but it was gone Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q When you came up and found Hunter in the custody of Armstead did you hear him say that he had been running after one man who had been knocking another man down A The words he used were You are mistaken it is not me he also said There was a man knocked down I am running after the man who knocked him down or something very near it MR W J PAYNE Q Had any one passed you between the time of your turning round the corner of Trinity-street and finding Hunter in the hands of the constable A No COURT Q Did you see one or two men go down Trinity-street A One and only one he was not running after any one JOHN ARMSTEAD policeman M 124 About a quarter past 1 o clock in the morning of 29th Oct I was on duty in Trinity square—I heard a cry of Stop thief or Stop him and heard some one running he was coming towards me from Blackman-street—there was only one person—it turned out to be Hunter—I laid hold of him he did not speak for some minutes when the other constable came up I took him to the station Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q I believe you were not actually in Trinity-square when you heard the cry of Stop thief A Yes I was—Trinity-street runs into the square—there is one other street called Church-street that runs into the square there is no other—Swan-street is between Blackman-street and Trinity-street COURT Q Was he running after another man A He was the only person WILLIAM BROAD policeman L 23 On Saturday night 8th Nov I took Murty into custody between 8 and 9 o clock in Webber-street—I had been in search of him for some time—I and another constable were in a house having refreshment and from something the other constable said to me I went to the door and saw Murty running from Blackfnars road down Webber-street in the direction of the New Cut—I gave chase and overtook him—I told him I should take him into custody for being concerned with another man who was in custody for assaulting a man and robbing him in Blackman-street in the Borough about a week ago—he said If they had wanted me why did not they take me the other night when they came to the house and took a man in custody I opened the door to them —I took him to Tower-*treet station and there he said There are others ought to be apprehended as well as me —Mr Mason was sent for—I was not there when he came—previous to taking Murty I went with Mr Mason to different public houses on one or two occasions to seek for certain parties Cross-examined by MR METCALFE Q Did you among other places go to a public house next to the Surrey Theatre A Yes I was there one evening when a man called Bill the carrier came out—Murty was not there that evening not in front of the bar I did not see him—I did not see him standing near to Bill at the time the prosecutor was looking at him—I did not go into any room but if he had been in front of the bar I must have seen him—he was not standing outside—I did not apprehend a man named M Donald—I did not go to Murty s house at all before 8th Nov —I believe some constable of the M division did—I think there is a constable here who was present when M Donald was apprehended—I was not there—Murty did not say You might as well have taken any other man as me for this robbery —he said Others ought to be taken as well as me it was either taken or apprehended —I believe his words were Others ought to be apprehended as well as me —I did not hear him ask the inspector to allow some other persons to be put with him so that the prosecutor might select him from them—that was not done MR W J PAYNE Q Had Mr Mason before this given you a description of the prisoner A He had COURT Q Was he shown alone A He was not shown alone—I walked in with Mr Mason and in going into the room he saw Murty sitting in the reserve room straight on and without saying another word he turned round and looked at him and said That is the man —there was no other man there but Mr Mason was not aware that he was sitting in that room MR METCALFE Q Tou brought him expressly to see that prisoner A To see some one—I had not pointed any one out to him ALEXANDER DEARING policeman M 38 On Saturday night 8th Nov I was with Broad when he took Murty into custody—I took him to the station—on the following Sunday night as I was passing his cell door he said to me Jack you done it b—well to rights for me last night —I said Oh did I —he said Yes —I said You are to rights this time Tommy —he said Yes I know I am I am to rights this time —I have known him for the last five years—he knew me—he has called me Jack before—I have been a policeman very nearly six years COURT Q What is the meaning of to rights A I suppose he meant that he was got to rights for the case that I took him for—it is a slang term—it does not mean to write with a pen and ink—it is a cant phrase—I have heard it many times—it means You are in the right this time Cross-examined by MR METCALFE Q Was not this what he said I am to rights if you will do it for me A No—I have stated all that passed—I went to Murty s house and apprehended M Donald—Murty did not open the door to me on that occasion—I did not see him—I heard that he lived there—M Donald was discharged—I had not seen Murty from the time of the robbery till I apprehended him GUILTY The prisoners were further charged with having been before convicted THOMAS LETT policeman V 142 I produce a certificate— This certified the

this year he was tried at here for a robbery with violence at a jeweller s shop and acquitted—he has also been tried and convicted and had eighteen months Hunter When I came home from transportation I

Surrey and am a gardener On 15th Nov about half past 12 o clock at night I was in Tooley-street—the prisoner came up to me—I am sure he is the man—he asked me for something to drink—I wished him to go away but he would not—he kept staying about me he followed me—he went away for a minute or two and came up to me again in Tooley-street—he wanted me to give him something to drink—and another man came and joined him—I said Surely there is no public house open —he said Yes there is I will find one —he kept talking to me all the time but I kept leering away from him—he walked more behind me than beside me—he was joined by the third party between the Town Hall and St George s church—he said Surely you will give us something to drink —I told him there was no public house open—he said Yes there is if you will come with me I shall find one —he said Follow me —and I followed him—he went down a court and the man that had joined him kept behind-me and the prisoner before me—when I entered the court I said Surely there is no public house here —the prisoner said Yes there is I will find one —he went on a little further—I thought I was in danger but I thought the best way was to be as quiet as I could—the prisoner then knocked at the door of a house which appeared to me to be a private house—the door was opened and the prisoner went in—he said Come on —I went in and the third man followed me—I gave the prisoner 1s to get some gin and some beer—the gin was brought in and some was offered to me and from the scent I thought it was a drug—it did not at all smell like gin—I did not take any of it—I put the beer to my lips and tasted it but did not like it—I did not take the gin or beer—they did not drink the beer or the gin in my presence—shortly afterwards there were twenty or thirty persons in the room—I went out of the house—my suspicion was raised and I thought it better to leave—I left and got a few yards from the house—I was walking on the prisoner was close by and there was one man slipped his hands over my head and throttled me—I know that was not the prisoner—the prisoner was at my pocket—this was in the court not far from the door—I might have got twenty or thirty yards—before I came out of the room I said I wish to go and got off the seat that the prisoner had presented to me when I went in—some person in the house not the prisoner told me to stop longer—when they saw me determined to go the prisoner was close by the door—I do not know whether he opened it or not—I went out the prisoner followed me and the man that joined him and two others—yes there were four men—one was on each side of me—the prisoner was at my side at my pocket—I am sure he was one of the men—he was rifling my pocket at the time the man seized me by the neck—and one of the men kept hold of my other arm—the prisoner laid hold of me—there was another man on the other side and the man behind me that had his hand round my neck—he pressed me very tightly indeed—I could not call out—not a word—after being about my pockets they immediately ran off in different directions—the prisoner was awere that I knew him before so I kept by him—I stuck close by him—I called the police—the prisoner ran off and I followed him I laid hold of him and kept him till a policeman came up—I did not lose sight of him—after they had gone I looked in my pocket and missed two half crowns and 2s and my neck handkerchief was taken away and my umbrella and pocket handkerchief—these things were all safe after I left the house—the man that held me by the neck and another man loosened the handkerchief from my neck—the policeman came up to me immediately—the house I was in was not a public house—it appeared quite private—the court is in Redcross-street on the right hand side as you go from London Bridge—my proper side was the other side but I went across with the prisoner—when the other man joined the prisoner it was not discretionary with me it appeared quite compulsory—the turning we went in is not a cart way turning—the entrance is quite narrow and the street is wider Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Were you very drunk that night A No not at all—during that evening I had drank some rum at a house in Tooley-street just by the station—I do not know what time that was—it appeared I was spending the evening very comfortably—rum was the liquor I began with—I might have drank coffee before—I left Annerley nation at half past 7 o clock and got to London by 8 o clock—it might be about half past 12 o clock when I met the prisoner Q How were you disposing of your time from 7 o clock till half past 12 o clock A That is my business you have nothing to do with that—I came up to see a friend of mine—I do not know how long I was in the public house—it might be an hour after I arrived when I went into the public house—it would be impossible for me to say what time I left the public house—I went into the public house and went back to the office to see my cousin—I was not aware what office he was in—I inquired and they said they believed at so and so office—I went but could not find him—I went back to the public house—I do not know how long I had left the public house before I met the prisoner—it was not immediately—it might have been an hour—I had two glasses of rum—I stopped a long while over one—after I left the public house I went to a place to get some refreshment—I did not fall asleep there—I was not in the house five minutes—it was in Tooley-street in a coffee shop—I did not have anything there—I asked something of the waiter he answered me in a very surly manner and I came out—I mean to swear I only drank two glasses of rum—it was on Saturday night—I do not know what hour it was when I got to the strange house where the twenty or thirty persons were—I never saw the prisoner before that night—when I came out of the strange house I had two half crowns and two shillings—the prisoner s hand was in my pocket and another man s hand was in my pocket—the prisoner s hand was in the pocket where my money was—I do not know that I felt him withdraw the money—I did not feel my pocket just directly afterwards—I was rather in a curious situation—it was in Redcross-court—there was the prisoner on one side another man opposite to him the man that had got me by the neck and the man that undid my handkerchief and there were some more standing by I do not know how many looking on—I charged another man with this robbery but when I charged him it was in the dark he was taken to the station and discharged there I could not swear to him I had another man taken before the Magistrate—he came to hear the charge against the prisoner I looked round and said there was a man very like one—I would not take upon me to swear that was the man—I would not swear against him he was in the Court—I said that I should be able to recognise the other three—I went to the street met a man gave him into custody and he was discharged—I brought him to the station and when he got there he declared he had nothing to do with it—I do not know that I heard him say anything in going along—I was walking close beside him—at the police court I charged another man—the Magistrate wished me to look round and see if I could pick out any I looked round and said There is a man very like him —from his whiskers being shaved off and from his coat I thought he was the man but he was not taken into custody—I come to London to see my cousin—I went after this to stop with my cousin in the Kent-road—I believe there was a gas in the court where I was robbed—I mean to swear I did not lose sight of the prisoner—the men all took different directions—I knowing the prisoner better than the others said I should stick by him from the treatment I got—he treated me very badly—if they had kept me in that position I should have lost my life COURT Q What time did you get to town A About 8 o clock—I had a friend and he left me and after that I went to the public house—I did not see the prisoner till he met me in Tooley-street—I was in the public house till it closed—I was standing just in the house I did not sit down—I was turned out when they closed—that was at 12 o clock—I then went to the coffee shop—I do not know the sign of the public house if I went to Tooley-street I should be able to recognise the house—I expected to find my cousin at the station but I thought some of the porters might be coming into the public house—I did not inquire for him in the public house—I knew my cousin s address in the Old Kent-road—my cousin is in some receiving office—the inspector knows him very well—his name is Hoay—I am sure I never swore to those other two persons at all JOHN ENGLAND policeman A 468 On that Sunday morning 20 minutes before 3 o clock I heard a cry of Stop thief in High-street Borough it appeared to be at the back of the Town Hall—there is a turning there called Golden Last-alley which leads by the back of the Borough Market into High-street—Redcross-court is further up High-street—when I heard that cry I saw the prisoner running from Golden Last-alley COURT to PETER CONELAN Q You told us this house was in Redcross-court A Yes I was robbed in that street it is between the Town Hall and St George s church—I did not see the prisoner come out of any court into the Borough JOHN ENGLAND re-examined On hearing the cry I saw the prisoner running from Golden Last-alley and the last witness was running after him—he was close upon him—from Golden Last-alley a person might get straight to Redcross-street—you must come out of Redcross-court into High-street and then into this court—the prosecutor laid hold of the prisoner in my presence gave him into my custody and charged him with robbing him of 7s a neck muffler an alpaca umbrella and a pocket handkerchief—I found on the prisoner at the station 6d and an old fork Cross-examined Q Do you know Redcross-court A Yes—to get from there into Golden Last-alley you would have to go into Redcross-street and then into Union-street and that would bring you back to High-street COURT Q Can you go from Redcross-street to Union-street A Yes and then into the Borough and coming down High-street you can go into Golden Last-alley—the prosecutor did not take me to the spot—he seemed very much frightened and complained that he had been very much hurt—he might have been drinking I thought I could smell it—I am sure the prisoner ran—I saw him Cross-examined Q Was the prisoner sober A Yes quite sober—I was with him till the charge was entered COURT to PETER CONELAN Q Were you robbed in the same street in which the house was A Yes—I ran after the prisoner—I do not know whether I got into the Borough or any other place but when he ran I followed him and kept very close to him—the Town Hall comes full with the Borough—the prisoner ran on one side and ran up a passage—I ran and caught him in that passage—that might be the place the policeman might mean GUILTY

t18570105-225  225 JOHN SCULLY and ELIZABETH SMITH robbery on William Goggin and stealing from his person 1l 4s his moneys WILLIAM GOGGIN I am a tailor On 17th Dec I was in Whitechapel High-street going towards Rosemary-lane—it was about half past 1 or 2 o clock on the morning of the 18th Thursday I think—I should say that I had about 1l or upwards in my pocket but cannot swear what—I was rather the worse for liquor—I left home with 1l 4s 6d at about 10 o clock and went to receive 3l at a club but I got none of it and did not receive it till a week or nine days afterwards—I told the police that I lost about 3l—I thought then being in liquor that I had drawn the 3l —I was under a mistake till I inquired afterwards—I gave evidence at the police office on Thursday the day after—I was to get the money at a temperance society No 86 Royal Mint-street—the prisoner laid hold of me in High-street Whitechapel and collared me and bursted the eyes out of my head—he thrust his knuckles into my collar—I remember that being done and that is all I recollect until I was taken to the station—I was not quite drunk but I was rather the worse for liquor—I got in liquor before I went to the Temperance Society s office—I forget whether I had some rum—I do not think I went into any house—it was Scully that had hold of my throat—I know him by his features—I had never seen him before but am certain he is the man—I know nothing about the woman—when I recovered my senses the inspector gave me 5s —I cannot swear that I had more than that—I did not spend 1l 4s —I am quite sure I lost money and that Scully is the person that thrust his hand into my pocket—he rubbed his knuckles into my neck and my senses went then Scully The constable took hold of me and he was asked in the street if I was the man who did it and he said No Witness No such thing—the policeman will tell you whether I was on my feet or lying down I only know that I was collared FRANCIS WILLIAMS policeman H 12 About half past 2 o clock on Thursday morning 18th Dec I saw the female prisoner and the prosecutor come out of the Bed Lion and Spread Eagle public house Whitechapel and walk together towards Whitechapel Church—Scully came out of the same public house and looked after them he then went in again and in a minute or a minute and a half came out and walked in the same direction as they had—in five minutes I heard a noise went and saw Scully on the pavement holding Goggin down with his knees upon his chest and as well as I could see his hands in his pockets—Smith was standing by his side—when I got within five or six yards of them Scully ran away—I sent Harler after him and detained Smith—I assisted Goggin up he could not speak for some time—he appeared to have suffered very much—Scully was brought back by Harler—Goggin was then just able to speak and said You have throttled me you have robbed me you thief —Scully said Me Sir and then fell on the pavement and pretended to be drunk but he had not the least appearance of it before—I had seen him five or six times in the half hour previous—he began to swear and kick and resisted violently all the way to the station we were obliged to put handcuffs on him at the station he was so violent I saw Goggin s left waistcoat pocket turned inside out and asked him what money he had lost he said I can hardly tell —after that he said I think I have lost between 3l and 4l —being the worse for liquor we detained him at the station for the night—Goggin appeared to be suffering very much and for a week afterwards when he was before the Magistrate Scully Q Did not he say when I was taken that I was not the person A He did not he identified you when you were brought back and again at the station when you were nearly half naked from your clothes being torn so WILLIAM JAMES HARLER policeman H 208 I heard a cry of Police went to the spot and saw the prosecutor groping down on the ground and Scully kneeling on his chest—he ran away and I ran after him and brought him back and Goggin identified him and said that he had robbed him of 4l —Smith stood on his left side as he lay down but I cannot say whether she did anything JAMES GAIR policeman H 447 On 18th Dec I was on duty in High-street Whitechapel and heard a cry of Police —I went across the road and saw Goggin lying on the pavement—Williams and I lifted him up and in a moment afterwards Scully was brought back in custody—Goggin looked at him and said That is the man that strangled me and robbed me of 4l —Scully said You cannot prove that —Goggin said You are the man —Scully threw himself on the pavement as if in fits and became very violent he resisted very much Scully s Defence I am innocent my hair was pulled out my shoes were taken off and I was beaten about the head—I tried to go quietly but they kicked me as I went along and served me the same at the station COURT to FRANCIS WILLIAMS Q How did the prosecutor and Smith walk A Arm in arm—I saw her do nothing else—I did not search her—I do not think she was searched at the station—I have seen the prisoners together in the same house that they came out of for a week previously WILLIAM JAMES HARLER re-examined I had seen them together every night for a fortnight before just about that spot—I searched Goggin—he had only 5s 1 1/2 d —I looked in every pocket—the 5s was in his right hand trowsers pocket and his left waistcoat pocket was turned out Scully I can prove that to be an untruth for I had not been long out of my trouble and was sick for a week after that SCULLY— GUILTY Aged 22 SMITH—

t18570105-243  243 CHARLES WILLIAMS JOHN BRYANT and WILLIAM COLE were indicted for a robbery with violence upon Charles Hogan and stealing a watch and 15s in money his property MR MAC ENTEER conducted the Prosecution CHARLES HOGAN I am a clerk to the Board of Works and live at No 39 Upper Bemerton-street Caledonian-road On the night of 17th Dec I was in the neighbourhood of Old Kent-road about 12 o clock—I came by the last Greenwich omnibus that was going to the West-end I got down at the Bricklayers Arms to take a Favourite omnibus from London-bridge—I asked the coachman the nearest way to London-bridge——he directed me down the road—as I went along I met two women—I asked them the nearest way to London—bridge—they said If you will give us something to drink we will show you —I said You shall have anything you like to drink if you will show me —we went into a public house and had some wine and cakes—I then asked them to show me the way—they said Down that way pointing to the right—I went down that way—I have no recollection of the females accompanying me—I had been drinking but I knew what I was doing—when I went down the street the first sensation I had was blindness I was thrown on my back and the sight was taken from my eyes by strangulation I found my tongue protruding—I do not know the cause of it all I know is I was nearly choked I do not know whether it was by a hand or cloth or cord or what it was before I had time to think of myself I was on my back and choking I could not breathe—there were men about me I heard their feet pattering about me—there were no words spoken until I was nearly dead and then a man about two yards to the right of me said Don t choke him outright —there was a hole made in my tongue I do not know by what means—I remember my tongue protruding and endeavouring to scream and I could not—there was a hole next morning it was not quite through my tongue—it was sore for about a week it has healed now but there is a hole still—as soon as one of them said Don t choke him outright I found myself relaxed from their grasp a little and I could then breathe but I was unable to move—simultaneously a hand went into my right hand pocket and took my watch and about 15s in silver—I then heard them depart—nothing was said—I was unable to move I was on my back—I lay there for about twenty minutes I should think—I was insensible but conscious of what had happened—one moment longer would have killed me—my impression is that one man held me by the neck one by each arm and one was on my breast and I fancy that I threw that man off into the mud by my exertions—I should say I remained there about twenty minutes but I cannot say exactly—as soon as I was able I got up and ran and cried out Police and Murder —I met a policeman and asked him where was the station house he directed me to the station house at Stone s—end—I went and told the sergeant on duty what had happened and while I was doing so the two women that had directed me came in and said they knew the men that did it—they gave a statement which the sergeant took down—I am not aware that a man came into the public house while I was there with the females—I saw a man in his shirt sleeves and I asked the publican if he kept men there for fighting—I never saw any of the prisoners before JANE EVANS I am the wife of William Evans and live in William-street Star-corner On Wednesday night 17th Dec between 12 and 1 o clock I was in the neighbourhood of the Dover—road with Elizabeth Atkinson—we met the prosecutor—he asked us to show him the way to London—bridge we said Yes and went with him some distance—we went into a public house with him to have something to drink and when we came out we were overtaken by two or three men and palled down—I was knocked down and Mr Hogan—I do not think they meant to pull me down but I fell down—Mr Hogan hallooed and screamed—I and my friend screamed out You have murdered the man and we ran—I got through nearly to the top of Crosby-row and laid hold of Williams—I got in front of him—I knew him as Christopher Wilks—I had got in front of them—this was through another turning into Crosby—row just by the turning up at the back of Guy s Hospital—I cannot say how far that was from where the prosecutor was knocked down it was at the bottom of another street—I said to Wilks You have robbed the man he said I will stick my knife in you if you come any further and he called my friend a dreadful expression and he sent several messages and threats to me—Cole is innocent we met him by himself in Suffolk-street as we were going to the station and I believe Bryant is innocent—I cannot swear to him but Cole I know was not there I met him with a young woman in Suffolk—street and told him what had occurred—I saw one of the men with a watch in his hand but I could not swear to him—I cannot say whether he was bigger or smaller than Williams—Williams said they would say that I was connected with the robbery and had 5s of it—I went to the police station and gave information there of what had occurred—I had known Williams by sight for some time by the name of Wilks ELIZABETH KILLETT I live at No 3 King William-street Star-corner On Wednesday night 17th Dec after 12 o clock I was in the neighbourhood of Dover-road with Evans—we met the prosecutor and went to a public house and had some refreshment—after we left the public house when we were going down George-street three young men came behind us—the tallest one pulled the prosecutor backwards and also Evans—I rau screaming Police —the three men all ran past us but Evans caught hold of Williams—he told her he would stick his knife in her and he also told me he would serve me worse than he had the gentleman—we met a policeman a good while after in Long—lane we told him of it and went back to the place where it was done and he told us to go to the station—I do not think Cole was there we met him in Suffolk-street with a young woman as we were going to the station—I know nothing about Bryant BARBARA MOORE I am the wife of Henry Moore of No 15 Falcon-court St George the Martyr—I am the deputy of Mr Castle s lodging house—I know the three prisoners—I knew Williams by the name of Christopher Wilks—he and Bryant were lodging in the house on 17th Dec—they left about half past 12 o clock that night—a man came to fetch Wilks out and Bryant went with him—I do not know at what time they returned—I saw Cole come in between 10 and 11 o clock next morning—I did not notice the state of his clothes ELIZABETH ALLENSON I am the wife of George Allenson—I am housekeeper to Mr Castle of No 15 Falcon—court Southwark—I remember being in the house on 17th Dec —I went to the theatre and when I returned Chris Wilks was in bed and Bryant or Wallop as we called him was lying on a form in the kitchen—that was about twenty minutes to 12 o clock—after that a person came into the house—I do not know him—he called out Chris —I opened the parlour door and said If you want any one go to the kitchen door you will find the deputy she will answer you—he said I want Chris to go and do a garotting in Kent—street —Wallop went down to call Chris—he came up again with Chris and all three went out that was near 1 o clock—they returned at very near 2 o clock—I could not tell who returned for I was in the parlour and Mr Castle would not allow me to go out—when I heard them run in I heard them say Has anybody been here after us is it all right —Wilks and Wallop were in the kitchen next morning at breakfast I heard them talking about how much money they had got and how much the breakfast would come to and what their shares would be each—Wilks was telling Wallop how much it would come to and how much he would give to Cole and how much he was to get for himself—Wallop said they had very nearly killed the old b— and if so be they had known there was any more about him they might have done it quite—when Billy Cole came in in the morning for his shirt I beard them arguing in the kitchen about how much he was to have—when Cole came in he had mud on him and he walked lame—some words passed between Williams and Cole but I could not hear what it was—I heard that there was a watch and that was sold for a pound and that Billy Cole took the 15s out of the gentleman s pocket and Wallop took the watch—they call sharing the money their regulars —that was said at breakfast—Cole went away murmuring he would not work with them any more—the others remained in the kitchen all day Cole Q Did I go away before you went out of the kitchen A No—you were in the kitchen when I returned into the parlour—you had gone out into the yard to put your clean shirt on—I did not see Williams give you anything while I was there—Williams followed you out to speak to you COURT Q How came you to know what regulars meant A Only by hearing them talk of it in the kitchen EDWARD COLE policeman M 53 I took Williams and Bryant on the 18th at No 15 Falcon-court a lodging house and Cole on the 19th—the place was all in an uproar when I went in—I told them the charge but I could not exactly hear what they said—it was dark—I got the master of the lodging house and got a candle—it is a den of thieves—when they were at the station they denied all knowledge of anything about it Williams s Defence I have been concerned in the robbery but not

t18570202-320  320 JOHN WILLIAMS and HENRY MILLER were indicted together with another person for a robbery with violence on Joseph Harris and stealing 1 watch and 1 guard chain his property MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution JOSEPH HARRIS I am collecting clerk to Messrs H and E Rosier of Limehouse and have been so forty years On Saturday 10th Jan I was in Rose-lane Stepney between 12 and 1 o clock in the day—I was walking along with a leather travelling bag in one hand and an umbrella in the other—the Black wall railway runs across Rose-lane—there are three arches one crosses each of the pathways and one crosses the road—when I got within about sixty yards of the first archway the prisoner Miller came off the footpath as deliberately as possible and came towards me—when he came close to roe he stopped in front of me and said Old gentleman we have been waiting for you —I was instantly seized from behind by two men—I turned my head sharply and saw there were two—one took charge of my arms and the other took charge of my head—my head was pressed down and something as cold as possible put over my face I could neither speak nor see no further than I know that the man who met me in front took my watch out of my waistcoat pocket—the weather was cold at this time it might have been a hand that was put over my face—Miller tore the watch through my buttons—he tore the buttons off my waistcoat in doing so—finding that he could not get the guard off my neck for I always button one side of it in my braces and it was a strong solid gold guard he seized it with all his might and broke the guard—it was enough to cut my neck through indeed I wonder it did not do so—he broke the guard and took the watch away—I then felt his hand going to my right hand pocket—having a considerable sum of money in my left pocket I struggled to get my mouth clear and sang out Police —and at that instant I received a blow which knocked me down and knocked my senses completely out of me—my recollection never came to me again until the next day—I fell on my arm and have not been able to lift it to my head since—I recollect nothing after I was knocked down until I found myself at home the next morning—I live at Barnet—the prisoners were taken into custody I think about seven or eight days afterwards and when I went to the police station to see them my recollection had not rightly recovered and my eyes were so bad I could not actually trust to them—I would not then swear to Miller but I stated to the magistrate that to the best of my belief he was the man—I can now firmly swear he is the man—I never saw my watch again—I understand that my carpet bag was picked up and brought to the station but I know nothing at all about that Cross-examined by Mr HOBRY for Miller Q Are you quite sure that you have got your recollection now A Quite sure I have always told the same story that I have now—I never said that Miller took me round the waist—I say now that Miller is the man who came in front of me—I have not said so before to-day— The witness s deposition was here put in and read —that is the statement I made with the exception of being seized round the waist—I did not state that—it was read over to me and I signed it—it was after I sang out Police that I was knocked down—they tell me that I gave a description of the persons who assaulted me but I do not recollect it——I was taken into the station of the Blackwall Railway after it happened—I afterwards gave a description of the parties to the police—there were three persons engaged in it MICHAEL MURRAY I am a cooper s apprentice and live at No 5 Steven s-buildings Queen-street Ratcliff On the day in question I was coming from a pawnbroker s shop in the Commercial-road with a basket in my hand—I saw Mr Harris coming under the railway arch in Rose-lane—he was just going into the arch and I saw Williams come over knock him down and run away—that was the first that I saw—I did not see any watch taken—I did not see any other person—I know a man named Briney—I saw him at the corner I suppose he was looking out Cross-examined Q You saw all that took place did you A Yes I saw Williams come up—I am sure it was Williams—I did not hear the prosecutor cry Police —I told what I saw to a police sergeant—I did not see anything that occurred before Mr Harris was knocked down Williams He has been heard to say that he would lag me the first chance he had Witness That is not true COURT Q You were coming from the Commercial-road A Yes Mr Harris was coming towards the railway—I went under the middle arch where the carts go in the road—Mr Harris was just going into the arch—I did not see him before any body touched him—as soon as I saw him the blow was struck—there was nobody about him at the time—there were two more persons standing at the railway arch and a man standing at the bottom but they were a long distance from him—when he was struck he lay down on the ground—he was very nearly knocked insensible—I was going to pick him up but he got up himself and was going away without his bag—I picked it up and he came back for it—I knew Williams before by sight but not by name—I gave a description of him to the sergeant—I did not describe anybody else—he is the man that knocked Mr Harris down ROBERT TIVEY I live at No 3 Susanna-road Dorset-street and am a rigger On Saturday morning 10th Jan between 12 and 1 o clock I was talking with another lad and we happened to turn round and saw the old gentleman lying on the ground at the end of the court and the prisoner with his leg across him—I cannot exactly say which prisoner it was because he was off in au instant—but when the old gentleman was walking into the station the other prisoner laughed as he was going in—I only saw one person close to Mr Harris the other one was a little way off down by the court—that was Briney—I know Miller—he is the one that laughed as the old gentle-man was going into the station—I know Williams by sight—I saw Briney Miller and Williams all three together before the robbery was committed—I cannot exactly say how long before—it was that same morning—I cannot say whether Williams is the man that I saw standing over the old gentleman—I cannot say who it was Cross-examined Q Did you see him knocked down A No I saw him on the ground—I did not go up to him—one of the witnesses did and led him into the station—I gave a description to sergeant Smith of the persons I saw about Mr Harris that same night—I saw the prisoners in custody a week afterwards sergeant Smith fetched me to see them—he told me I was to pick out the one I saw laugh—the prisoners were in a room with a lot more—I picked Miller out—I did not pick out anybody else COURT Q The only man you saw meddle with the prosecutor was the man that had his legs between his A Yes I do not know that man-Miller was on the other side of the road—he is the only man I know—all I saw him do was to laugh as the old gentleman went into the station and when he got to the corner by Massey s public house he ran across the road and went down some street GEORGE BUDD I live at No 5 Phoenix-place Ratcliff-cross and get my living by selling newspapers On Saturday 10th Jan I saw the old gentle-man on the ground at the bottom of the arch and I saw a person standing with his leg over him—I cannot swear which that was—I saw Miller when the old gentleman was coming into the station—he was on the other side of the road and he laughed—I was talking to Tivey at the time—when Miller got to the corner he took to his heels and ran—I saw Briney as they call him at the further end of the road standing at the corner of London-street—I had seen all the three together about nine o clock that morning standing in front of Massey s public house Cross-examined Q Do you mean to say that you know all of them A Yes I could not see the face of the man who had his leg over Mr Harris—I was selling my papers at the station at the time WILLIAM SMITH police sergeant K 28 I received information and took the prisoners into custody on Sunday morning the 18th at a coffee house in High-street Stepney—they were both in the same bed there—I took them to the station—they were charged with stealing a gold chain and watch from the person of Mr Harris in Rose-lane on the 10th of the same month—Miller said I was at Chatham at that time and I have witnesses to prove it —Williams made no remark Miller It is false I never said anything of the kind Witness I am quite certain he did Potter another constable was present at the time and the acting

t18570302-369  369 JOSEPH CHIVERALL and JOHN MCCORMICK feloniously assaulting John Renwick with intent to rob him MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution JOHN RENWICK I live in Gifford—street Kingsland On the night of Sunday 11th Jan I was in Church—street Shoreditch a little before 10 o clock—I saw both the prisoners—three men attacked me—I was not perfectly sober but sober enough to know what I was doing—they struck me and knocked me—I fell against a door which flew open and I fell into the passage—Chiverall then threw himself upon me while I was on the ground—I grasped him with my arms and M Cormick kicked me in the face—I called out Police —while Chiverall was on me he attempted to tear my coat open and take my pocket book which was in my breast pocket—my coat was buttoned as it is now—I got partly up and Chiverall knocked me down again—Mr Jackson came to help me he pulled Chiverall off me I got up and seized Chiverall by the throat—a policeman came up and I gave Chiverall into custody—M Cormick kicked me in the face while I was on the ground and then ran away—I received a kick from him in the ribs when I was knocked down and Chiverall threw himself on me—I was very ill for several days and under a doctor my lip was cut and my forehead and I had a black eye—I did not know either of the prisoners before—I had no quarrel with them—nothing was taken from me Cross-examined by MR METCALFE Q Did this all take place in the presence of Mr Jackson A No—he keeps a public house—I do not know that he was standing at his door I did not see him there—I will swear that to my knowledge this did not all take place in his presence—I do not know what part it was that he could not see—I know now that he saw the whole of it—I had not been drinking the whole evening—I did not leave home till past 8 o clock—this took place about 10 o clock—I did not want to fight the prisoners decidedly not—I seized Chiverall by the throat and gave him to the constable—I did not to my knowledge when at the station attempt to strike Chiverall nor was I prevented by two constables—I have no recollection of it—I went into Mr Jackson s just before this—I did not stop there a moment—I came out of the side door and then came past his house—Mr Jackson had not been drinking inside—I did not see him at all there—there were two ladies in the bar—this did not take a minute—the police—man and Mr Jackson came up almost in an instant—I did not say a word to the policeman about Chiverall striking me at all—I mean to swear now that he did strike me decidedly—if it had not been for this pocket book I should have been severely injured—I did not show the police the bruise on the side I went to the doctor the next morning—there was nothing particular it was only a slight bruise—I did not see the constable before he came up JAMES JACKSON I keep the King s Head in Church-street On Sunday night 11th Jan I saw the prosecutor at my door—I was then going out—he was coming out—I went to the other door the bottle department and stood there—I saw two young men about ten yards from the door—the prisoner Chiverall was one they were together—the prosecutor wan passing and they turned round immediately behind him and Chiverall attempted to put his hand into his pocket—the prosecutor turned round and seized Chiverall by the collar and as soon as he had done that the other person struck the prosecutor in the face and knocked him against a door—the door flew open and he fell in the passage—I ran up immediately and the other one ran away—I took hold of Chiverall by the collar and pulled him off the prosecutor—the prosecutor got up took hold of Chiverall by his collar and called out Police —a policeman came and took him—the other man ran up Boundary—street the direction the policeman was coming down—I saw the second person and from M Cormick s stature and appearance I believe him to be the man Cross-examined Q Did the prosecutor pass you A Yes and the two persons stood with their backs towards the window—they turned and the hand of one I could see distinctly attempted to put in the pocket—they were standing ten yards off and when they did this they had not gone I should think more than one yard further—they were at that time between the prosecutor and me—I saw Chiverall s hand going from him in a direction to the prosecutor s pocket—I am certain of it—he touched him and directly the prosecutor turned round and seized him—that appeared to me to be in consequence of his feeling something done to him and directly on that M Cormick knocked him down—I cannot say whether the prosecutor had hold of Chiverall till he fell—when I got up Chiverall was upon the prosecutor in the passage whether he pulled him down I cannot tell—I staid till the policeman came which was in half a minute—I did not see the policeman till he came up—there were other persons round after this was done—a great many persons were about but whether they had been with the prisoners I cannot tell—the prosecutor had a black eye and his nose was hurt I believe he had a scratch on his neck I did not notice his lip—I did not see any conversation with the prosecutor and these men before this happened JOHN ROSS policeman U 227 I was on duty in Church-street on the night of 11th Jan —I saw the prisoners pass about ten minutes before this happened—they were in company

up and Chiverall on him—the prosecutor had hold of Chiverall—I saw M Cormick run towards Shoreditch I cannot say whether he turned the corner of Boundary—street or not Chiverall s statement before the Magistrate was here read as follow I am very sorry for it I did not strike him COURT to JAMES JACKSON Q How was the prosecutor A He was the worse for drink but quite conscious of what he was about

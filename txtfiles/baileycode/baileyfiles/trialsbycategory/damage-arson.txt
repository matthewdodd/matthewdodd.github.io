gave me reason to think I had not fair play I went to Sir John Fielding and got a search warrant and went to Mr Howard s a pawnbroker and asked if Mrs Greaves had pawned any linen there he said she

did sell them to Mr Bolland some time before the fire happened Mr Bolland sent word he would advertise the goods and sell them this was I think the Monday before the fire if she did not let him have the money he had lent upon them she had said her husband was coming and coming but before she would have her goods advertised and sold she would set them on fire and burn them all I heard her say that more than once or twice and he that was in possession with me heard her say the same The morning the house was set on fire between six and seven she sent the maid out of an errand to Mr Bolland and

was nobody at the door I came down again and said madam your house is all of a smother she said it may be by the people washing at the next house I said is it usual to smoke so at such time she made

house is on fire the fire comes out at a two pair of stairs window it broke out in the maid s bed chamber that was a two pair of stairs room there had not been any fire in that room since I had been in the house which was fifteen days I ran up stairs in order to burst the door open but I could not get nigh it the smoke and sulphur came so strong there was George Dundass in bed above I called to

smoke if you can t through fire he did and came down the first words he said were Lord madam has set this house on fire on purpose Q How do you know the fire began in the maid s room Stainsby I saw

she was afraid the cat would haunt her I heard her several times talk thus I was in bed in the top of the house when the fire happened I think it was about seven o clock in the morning the sulphur came into the room I opened the door to let it out thinking the maid was lighting the fire below I found it began to increase I just got my clothes on Stainsby called out fire I heard the fire crack and saw it smoke more I got out at a window to go out upon the top and I could get no farther I was obliged to come in at the window again and come down through the fire Q What room was it you heard

watch-light she said she got out between five and six and put it out Q Could it come by the soulness of the chimnies M Lewis The kitchen and parlour chimnies were both swept after I came there it may be two or three months after I came there I saw part of the shutters of her room open in her room when I went out Frances Parker I live in the same street directly opposite the prisoner s house I used generally to see the windows open in a morning when I got up that morning I saw the windows shut about half an hour after seven as I was putting on my clothes I saw the smoke come out at the two pair of stairs windows there are two windows both were shut she was in general a very early riser and the windows were generally open Cross examination Q How could you see the smoke when the shutters were shut F Parker It came out at the crevices they were inside shutters and it came out between the brickwork I came down and told the prisoner she was very much frighted Prisoner s defence I am quite innocent I know nothing how it came Col Hamilton never took a room of me I gave him leave for a few days to leave some things with me that fellow Stainsby has said he would be revenged of me he smoked tobacco in my house all this is spite and malice entirely there is none more cautious of fire than I am by being dreadfully burnt out before at Wapping wall this Bolland wanted to arrest my husband he sent his bailiffs after me and I was carried to his house he heard I was going to sell my goods I let him come and appraise my goods he put in two fellows I said to him Mr Bolland take that man out of my house he smokes so I cannot live in the house Col Hamilton desired me to recommend him to a workwoman to make him some stocks I employed a woman in my house I did not know he would take the key of the garret away I had a key of the other garret that opened his room I did surely make use of his things but I intended to fetch them again in a few days I never wronged man woman or child in all my days and now I am upon my trial by the confusion of my attorney my witnesses are not here I should have had 500 to my character I can prove I have been a woman of an undeniable character I have the best of characters that any poor woman has this man has robbed my husband of his goods and now he wants to take my life away I know not how the fire came unless by this cat she used to be frighted out of the kitchen and out of the parlour as she used to lie under the grate I told them to beat her away that Stainsby threatened my life he looks so like a thief I hated him every word he has said is all false Dundass said Bolland offered him 20 l to swear against me and he answered he would go to the farthest part of the world before he would George Dundass I never said any such thing he never offered me the value of a halfpenny To her character Mr Golding I live in Rotherhithe I have known her about ten years she has a very good character as far as I know Mr Perkins I live in Piccadilly I

to look at the first policy and tell me whether there is aa indorsement on it denoting that the goods had been removed A Yes that is on the policy of the 20th of January 1837—be indorsement is dated 2nd of June 1837 and states Removed to his swelling-house only situated No 28 High-street Marylebone —that policy was cancelled by the other being issued—there is no formal canceling at the back of it—that is not our course of business—the date of it is 20th of January 1837 but it commences from the 25th of December 1836 on the 25th of December 1837 and then expires as it is from year to year—the latter policy commences from the 25th of December 1837 GEORGE CAMPION I have been agent for the Union Insurance Office or the Eastern parts of the Metropolis—I know the prisoner—I never saw him tell he called on me after the fire—I knew his brother—it was on Monday morning the 22nd of January that the prisoner called on me in consequence of what passed between us I accompanied him that day the Union Insurance Office Q Did you afterwards at the suggestion of the prisoner or with prisoner s consent act for him in preparing with him any statement of loss A Yes—I went with him in the first place to Mr Toplis to with him—Mr Toplis is the general agent of the office—the Insurance office is in Cornhill—I prepared at the prisoner s dictation a statement his claim— Mr Toplis here produced the claim —this is the claim I made out—I sent that to Mr Toplis on the 1st of February—I prepared that papers produced to me by the prisoner and from statements he made—I had perhaps four or five interviews with the prisoner before it was completed he furnished me with the particulars out of which I made the inventory—had those interviews with him in my own office in Bishopsgate-street—I accompanied me to Mr Toplis in the first instance Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Where did you sign this A In my own office—Mr Toplis was not present—this is not the original that the prisoner gave me—he did not give me this—he gave me papers from which I took it—there was a rough draft made out by me at first—it is not the only draft I drew out by his directions—he had a copy of it—I drew it out in my book in the first instance Q Did the prisoner ever correct a draft that you drew up stating that it was incorrect and full of errors A Yes—that was a second claim—this bears date the 1st of February—that is the true date of it—it was signed by me on the 12th of February—it was signed on the day it bean date or thereabout—it was presented to the prisoner and he looked over it before it was delivered—I signed it about that date or previous it—it was made out for the inspection of my employer MR CLARKSON Q Take that in your hand again—you see at the end of the entitling of it is written by George Campion auction and valuer Bishopsgate-street February 1st 1838 A Yes—it was delivered on that day—I have again signed it at the end as a declaration—that was on the 12th when we both appeared before Mr Toplis—nothing passed after the delivery of it on the 1st between the prisoner myself or Mr Toplis on the subject of the inventory except the appointment an interview to go into it—no alteration was made in that copy between the 1st when I delivered it to Mr Toplis and the 12th when I delivered it as a statement—after Lmade out that inventory I made out a copy for the prisoner and I had a conversation with him on the evening of the on the subject of his copy—that was previous to this being subscribed me and dated 12th February—this is the copy I delivered to the prisoner— looking at it —I gave him that copy three or four days previous to the 12th—I had some conversation with him at my office on the evening of the 12th before we went to Mr Toplis—he then said the original inventory was incorrect—he said things had been stated in error in my original copy and were not on the premises on the night of the fire—he brought his copy to me with some articles struck out stating that they were not on the premises at the time of the fire and that the statement was incorrect in that respect—he did not give me any intimation of that before the 12th of February—the first correction I observe is written in the margin respecting the wine and spirits at page 5—there is written in the margin that the spirits and wine were in the parlour-closet instead of the wine-bin—I cannot say in whose writing these marginal notes are—that is the way in which the prison brought it to me—in page 7 the balance ivory-handled knives and forks valued at guineas twenty-four ditto dessert 1l 14s and one pair of carvers 8s in the back parlour ground floor are all struck out and in the margin is written Mistake sold to Midgley about June last —the next is at page 5 two large clothes-brushes 5s in the front room second floor—they are struck out and twice entered written in the margin—the next articles are under the head of w apparel two black silk handkerchiefs 10s twice entered is written in the margin and the articles struck out—the next is under the head baby-linen six long muslin robes 5l 10s six muslin petticoats 1l 10s 6 monthly gowns 2

pockets 6s struck out and mistake written in the margin one India crape dress 1l 10s not our own written in the margin one ging-ham umbrella struck out and twice entered written in the margin—under the head of watches and trinkets there is silver bells and coral page 7 struck out and the words see Midgley written in the margin—those are the whole of the alterations suggested by the prisoner on the 2th of February—the alterations were already made in the list when he brought it it to me—those are the alterations between the copy delivered to Mr Toplis on the 1st and the one the prisoner brought me on the 12th Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Now Mr Campion did not the prisoner refuse to sign that inventory as of the date of the 1st of February He refused to sign it altogether—he did not refuse on the ground that dough it was to be signed on the 12th I was dating it as if it was signed on the 1st—I am not aware that he offered to sign his own corrected list did not to my knowledge—he did not sign it and therefore Mr Toplis failed on me to sign the declaration—he did not offer to sign his own corrected list to my knowledge—I should think I could not forget it if he did—he did not to my knowledge—how can I swear positively I know of to such thing—Mr Toplis Mr Rickards and his clerk were present Q On your oath did not Mr Toplis interfere to prevent Mr Miers signing his own corrected list A Not to my knowledge—I have no recollection of it—I never heard him offer to sign it—he refused to sign one list I believe because he said it was incorrect—he said it was incorrect and therefore he would not sign it—it was the first one he refused to sign which is the one I had made out which he had not corrected dated the 1st of February and that is the inventory I signed for him on the 12th—he refused a sign the inventory—I cannot say whether he refused to sign the declaration at the end of it—Mr Toplis asked him on the 12th to sign the inventory and he refused on the ground that it was incorrect—it was after he refused to sign the inventory that I wrote this declaration but the same night—that is a declaration of mine—I have read it—it is a declaration of mine—I do not conceive that Mr Miers was asked to sign that declaration—I believe he was not because it is a declaration of my own—I can say no more Q Now were you acting as his agent as well as agent of the Union A In that capacity I was not acting for the Office but for him and I expected to be paid by him—I got the whole of his books for what I know as his agent—he delivered them himself to Mr Toplis on the 12th of February—I did not deliver them Q How many books had you from him to help to make out these accounts A reading Delivered to Mr Campion all my books as follows —one ledger one day-book one stock-book one paper case containing invoices and one brown paper parcel containing bills of parcels signed Robert Miers —the declaration at the end of the inventory is not in my handwriting it is Mr Toplis s—the signature is mine Q Now I ask you did not Mr Toplis in your presence twice delivery pen with ink in it into the prisoner s hands and ask him to sign that declaration before you signed it A I am not aware of it—I believe not—it did not take place that I know of—I will not swear positively—he did either not the pen into his hands or offer it to him to sign the inventory but I because not to sign the declaration—I am not aware of his asking him to do so—I believe he did not—not the declaration—I was present—he did not put the pen into his hands and ask him to sign the declaration in my presence hearing that is my present impression—I know of no such thing—I have been an agent to the Union for some years—I have acted in a good many claims and concerns in effecting insurances Q When you were employed by Mr Miers did you tell him you had occasionally acted as agent for the Union in effecting insurances A Yes he insured through me—I gave him a copy of the first inventory—he applied for it one day and I think he had it the next—I think it was about the 9th that I furnished him with the copy—he applied for it somewhere about the 8th—I believe it was about the 8th or 9th—it was certainly not the 6th or 7th that he applied—I am now looking at my inventory book—I think it was about the 8th I furnished him with the copy—I have not the day entered—it is possible it may have been on the 6th that he applied to me—I have said before it was about the middle between the 1st and the 12th MR KELLY Q I think the 4th of February was on a Sunday are you sure it was not till after Sunday the 4th of February that he applied to you for the copy A It was after Sunday the 4th of February—when I delivered the first inventory No 1 to Mr Toplis on the prisoner s authority on the 1st of February it had not this declaration on it—I then delivered it as a claim of Mr Miers so far as he had insured—Mr Miers came to me again about the time mentioned and stated that there were several things which were wrong and asked me to make him a copy for his own private use—I do not recollect any thing he particularly mentioned then except the coral—he said he had no copy of the slips of paper he had given me and he wished to have a copy for his private use to see what was claimed—I do not recollect any thing else taking place then—he took the copy away next day—I think he mentioned the bells and coral on the first day—he said there were several things incorrect and I think he mentioned the bells and coral—he said that the lists that were given me were made out in enter—I think I gave him the copy the next day—this is the copy I gave him No 2 the day or two days after he asked for it—I really cannot recollect whether I had any further conversation with him respecting the corrections or mistakes when I gave him the copy—I think I saw him once or twice after between then and the 12th on the subject of the details Q Do you remember on either of those occasions or on any occasions down to the 12th whether he pointed out or spoke of any other errors omissions or corrections except such as appear on that copy A I really cannot recollect—I have no recollection that he said there were any other errors—I saw him on the 12th in Mr Toplis s office—we met there by appointment—I had made the appointment with Mr Miers about seven o clock in the evening—we met at Mr Toplis s own private house in Bridge-street—only one inventory was produced in the first instance—that was No 1 —Mr Toplis produced it—he had it previously—I believe Mr Miers was requested to sign it—he then said he could not sign it because there were many errors in it—then Mr Miers produced the copy I had given him No 2 which was intended for his own private use marked as to errors—it was produced as altered by him-self with the alterations which have been read—I have no recollection that the pointed out any errors besides those which were altered—Mr Toplis asked him many questions about No 2 —I cannot recollect exactly the particulars—there was a great deal of conversation between Mr Toplis and the prisoner Q I see with regard to the amount of stock these two statements completely agree as to the loss sustained at the fire 3217l 9s 8d —I want to know whether during the whole of the conversation any objection was made or any error stated to have been committed with respect to the amount of the stock A I believe not—as far as I recollect no error was pointed out except those mentioned in No 2 —I think I recollect now that Mr Toplis after Mr Miers refused to sign No I asked him to sign the other No 2 —I think so—I think he refused to sign it—he certainly did not sign it—I signed nothing except this declaration—I think we separated about half-past ten o clock—we had been together from seven o clock till half past ten o clock MR PHILLIPS Q Did you make out the copy for the prisoner on a Saturday night and sit up till twelve o clock to do it A I think it could not be on a Saturday night—I said I thought it was on the 8th or 9th—the 9th would have been Friday night—I do not think it could be Saturday night—it must have been on Friday night—I generally go out of town about five o clock on Saturday nights and I believe I did so that night—it could not be on Saturday night according to the impression on my mind—I am not aware that I apologised to the prisoner on the Monday night saying that it was not finished and I wanted an additional paper to make it up—it could not have been on Monday the 5th that I delivered it Q What makes you say with any degree of certainty that it was after Sunday the 4th you made the copy A I believe it was on the 8th or 9th—I have nothing entered relating to it—I have no book with me in which I enter what I do on any particular day or How I pass my time—I have a day-book where the time is entered—that book is at home—I have no objection to bring it—this book I have here is a mere diary—here is entered on Monday the 5th of February Received a letter of appointment from Mr Toplia and sent to make proper arrangements with Mr Robert Miers—when I went to make that proper arrangement he was not in the way—It is not stated in that book that he was not in the way Q Now Mr Campion I see you have entered very minutely in this book a great many things concerning Mr Miers will you be kind enough to tell me whether you have any entry at all as to when you made out the copy for him A If I had I could have answered you—I have not answered any thing positively only as to the impression on my mind—you would not have me state that which I do not know—there is an entry on the 9th of February— Robert Mieres s — advertisement —that does not relate to Mr Miers—it was merely put down to remind me of certain things first respecting Mr Miers and next respecting an advertisement I had to put in the paper—I do not recollect that I have any other diary but this book but we have a day-book MR JAMES TOPLIS I am a surveyor and appraiser and act as agent for the Union and several other offices I understood that Mr Miers had insured some property in High-street in the Union office—I heard of the fire on the Sunday morning—I believe the fire was on the Sunday morning the 21st and I was there about twelve o clock at noon—I have general instructions from the office to investigate claims and I took that step here—I met Mr Campion on the Tuesday as the agent of Mr Miers—I declared his claim to be sent in with a specification of the loss and this inventory No 1 was delivered to me on the 1st of February—it had not them the declaration at the end—in other respects it was exactly as it is now—the stock is mentioned in one round sum of 3200l and odd pounds—no specification or intimation was given me at that time as a what that stock was except what appears in that paper—I gave directions to have a specification of the stock charged to that amount—no books papers or vouchers were produced to me when that inventory was first delivered—I had appointments for Mr Campion to attend me prior to the 12th of February but they were not kept—we at last met by appointments on the 12th of February—until that time I had never seen the prisoner on this matter—I did not know him at all—at that interview I requested the particulars of his stock and he produced to me some papers relating to as old stock taking Q Had he before that put in his copy of the inventory A I cannot say which was done first—it was all simultaneous—he handed in an inventory which I have marked on the cover No 2 —when I asked him for the particulars of his stock he produced some papers which I have put together in the form they were in when I received them—he said they were the particulars of the stock taken on August 31 1836—I asked him for the particulars of his private mark which he gave me —I have it here in his own handwriting—he said he had been engaged in making out the detail of the stock and handed to me a list as far as he had gone—this is the list which with these papers were given to him when he went away and I became possessed of them at the hearing before the Magistrate—this list was as I understood from him a detail of the stock on the premises at the time of the fire as far as he had gone with it—he said the stock on August 31st 1837 was as he stated in the several papers and handed me papers of goods bought since and here they are and there is also a list of goods bought before—in support of the statement of the cash he had taken since the stock was taken in 1836 he handed me in that paper stating that the books which would have told the transactions were burnt—this was cash taken for goods sold—there were no other papers in reference to the stock—he brought his books which I have here—he said two books a cash-book and what he termed a small ledger which would have told the whole of the transactions had been burnt—other books had been preserved and those he produced—I asked him How it was he gave me an account of the cash taken if the books were destroyed—he said he had received that account from his brother that his brother attended once or twice a week as he was largely indebted to him and took from his books the account of the cash taken—he handed me a vast number of bills of parcels to confirm the buying which had taken place to the amount of 400l —many of the papers are duplicates—he left me with a promise to finish the detail account of the stock which was to come to the sum he stated—I did not return the bills to him—I returned the stock-paper and the account rendered of the stock burnt—he did not ask for the books—I returned him all he wanted and he promised to complete the account to sustain the sum he had claimed—he did not say that there was any thing incorrect in the amount of the stock—no error whatever was pointed out as to the amount of the stock—I do not recollect whether the inventory or the stock papers were produced first—the inventory No 2 was produced with some erasures and corrections on it—he said he wished to take them out—I asked him to sign the original claim No 1 which it is the custom to get signed—he refused to sign it and I wrote the declaration at the end of it as a qualification for him to sign it—Mr Campion said he would sign it and did—the prisoner himself refused to sign it—the declaration was put before him to sign and he refused— Declaration read — I hereby declare this claim to be made out from instructions and list given by Mrs Miers with the assistance of her servant and Mr Miers cut it is admitted that Mr Miers shall have the opportunity to make such alterations as he can prove are in error—otherwise he hat refuted to sign the above—signed GEORGE CAMPION 12th February 1838 Q He did not sign it A No the alteration was made to meet hit views—the addition was made because he said he would sign it if it was added but he refused to sign it and on his doing to a discussion took place respecting the corrections he had made in his copy of the inventory—he said Mrs Midgley the sister of hit wife was about to be confined and the baby linen had been lent to her and the child s coral and bells—there is a note written in the margin See Midgley against that—I understood him that the coral was at Midgley s—I do not remember any thing else being said about the child s coral—I asked him what he meant by erasing some of these things what was I to understand I had before this received certain information from some of the police he said he had taken tome things to a house he did not know the street it was to a coffee top a friend of Midgley where he was known—I asked him if he had been there since he had left them—he said no he thought he could find the shop but did not know the person s name—he said that Midgley had been in his service up to May and since May he had only had a boy and no shopman—he said Midgley had taken a shop and fitted it up in Crawford-street—that he advertised three times to open it but had not opened it—I do not know that he said why in express words but the meaning was that he could not obtain stock sufficient—he said he the prisoner had kept from four to six shopmen in Oxford-street from his commencement in October 1835 I think till March 1837 when he left—he said he considered his stock of the same value when he left Oxford-street as when he took stock August 1836-it is stated as 3000l odd in the paper—he said the stock was of that value—in the written inventory it is reduced to 2910l—he states it in a debtor and creditor s account—the turn of 1202l 13s it the amount If stock he was getting forward to deliver to me—he gave me that being the detail of the stock as far as he had gone and I apprehend the numbers on it refer to the number of divisions or drawers because he produced a plan of the shop—this paper is the statement of the stock at far at it went but which he was to complete Q Before he left on the evening of the 12th of February did he say any thing as to How the fire happened A I asked him the particulars—he said he had turned off the gat before he left the shop and went into his Parlour he had been there a considerable time taking his supper and from eleven to half-past eleven o clock I think he said Mrs Miers went up stairs to bed the servant attending her to warm the bed—about half an hour after he went up stairs—his wife was in bed and the servant is the room—that she stopped some few minutes and then came down that the servant was down a short time and I understood went up to call him or told him that there was fire in the shop—he came down stairs unlocked the door leading into the shop which had a glass sash and the shop was full of smoke—he returned up stairs to his wife told her to get up and dress herself for the shop was on fire—he soon came down stairs and he and the servant procured a small quantity of water and threw on the fire and he left it—he said he had lost the two books I have referred to but I understood nothing else but those not of his books and papers—I asked him what servants he had—he told me he had taken a boy on the Friday preceding the fire who was the only servant in the shop—he said he had taken the boy without a character and the boy had gone out on Saturday afternoon to return at six o clock but had not returned and he had not seen him since—he said he had given him leave to go out to fetch some things from Bermondsey—I understood him it was in the afternoon—he said the boy told him he had been in service at Chatham—he could not tell me the boy s surname Christian name or any thing about him—during the whole of the conversation he said nothing whatever of any error in his claim in respect of the stock Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How long altogether did the into view last between you and the prisoner A I should think about two hours—it took place at my house in New Bridge-street—the solicitor s clerk was present—he came there by my directions and Mr Richards called in while we were so engaged—they were there a great part of the time and Mr Campion also—the prisoner and Mr Campion came together—the first thing that took place when they came into the room was I told him that that gentleman was the solicitor s clerk and when Mr Richards came in I told him he was the solicitor to the office Q Did you not say when the prisoner first came in with Mr Campice that you had merely sent for him to sign the claim sent in by him and would not detain him longer than to sign it A Certainly not—I cannot tell the exact period at which I asked him to sign the claim—it is very likely I might ask him to do it when he first came in I cannot tell—I will not swear I did not ask him to do so the very first thing when he came in—I will not swear whether I put a pen into his hand and asked him to sign the claim or not—I did not make any memorandum of my questions or the prisoner s answers—my account is generally from my recollection—the prisoner did refuse to sign the first inventory—that was why the qualification was put at the end—I can say distinctly that the qualification was put before the prisoner to sign and then I asked Mr Campion to sign it—Mr Campion said he would sign it—he said he would sign it to prove to me that he had the prisoner s instructions to make out the claim—he said so at the time—I cannot tell whether it was before I asked him to sign it or after—I requested him to sign it—I do not recollect whether I put the pen into his hand myself—I will not swear about it—there were two ink-stands and pens on the table—I will not swear who took them up—I will not swear I did not put a pen first into the prisoner s hand and ask him to sign it because I cannot recollect whether I did or not Q I understand you to say he spoke about some stock of Midgley s was there any thing in the inventory about that A No there is no account of stock except his own—he said Midgley had obtained goods from houses in the City not paid for to the amount of 180l —he never told me those were some of the goods left at the coffee-house—he did not tell me he had not included Midgley s goods of the value of 180l in the general account as claimed—he did not say so in those terms—I will tell you what he did say he said when Midgley found he could not open the shop he had goods to the amount of about 120l and those were sent to his Miers s house but were not in the claim for something else was done with them they never went into his stock—he said the goods sent to his house were about 120l worth the residue of the 180l —he did not say that he had not included them in the general account—I was examined before the Magistrate—my deposition was read over to me—I called at the office after it was shut and the clerk read it to me and I signed it—I was only examined once at the office The Court read from the witness s deposition as follows — He had supplied Midgley with various goods for persons but ultimately the whole stock was removed to his the prisoner s house—that he considered them the value of 180l or thereabout but he had not included them in the general amount as claimed here Q When you were before the Magistrate did you state any thing at all of what the prisoner said to you about the mode in which the fire occurred A I cannot recollect at the present moment the precise statement—when I asked him what he meant by erasing these things I alluded to the articles the amount of 39l struck out in the inventory—it was on that he said what I have mentioned about the coffee-house—he said he did not wish to say any thing about Mr Midgley s affairs as he was in some degree of trouble Q Now with respect to the gas did not he tell yon he had turned off the gas in the shop but he could not turn it off at the main A I have on recollection of the word main being mentioned—I will not swear it was not but I have no recollection of it—I have no recollection of his speaking of the had state of the pipe—my impression is that he did not mention about the gas being faulty either at my house or any where else in my presence—I will not swear he did not mention about the deranged state of the gas-pipe in the conversation at my house but I believe he never said a word about the gas-pipe—I have no recollection of his saying any thing about the frost—I will not swear he did not—after he gave me all the papers and books and made the statement to me he left with a promise to supply the remainder of the account in a few days Q Was he not on going away with that promise taken into custody immediately by an officer whom you had planted there A I did not plant the officer—the commissioners of police did—it was not by my application—I did not apply to them—he was to come to my house—I knew the officer would be there but my advice was not to take him—one of the officers was stationed in the adjoining room—he could not hear what took place—it was before the interview that I advised the officer not to take him—I did not understand from my conversation with the prisoner that some of the 180l worth of goods were the goods that were taken to the coffee house—I will swear nothing of the kind occurred in the whole course of conversation because he never mentioned stock—I did not tell the policeman after the prisoner had gone away he must not take him—the policeman went out of the door I believe before the prisoner did—I am always concerned for six Fire-offices and I settle for ten sometimes—I was concerned for the Sun Fire-office in the case of a person named Jacobs who was prosecuted here which was afterwards referred to Mr Justice Patteson before he was a Judge—I have been concerned for the Sun Fire-officer nearly twenty-eight years—I was examined as a witness on that occasion in this Court—the prisoner was acquitted after a trial of twelve hours and a quarter—I was a witness before the arbitrator—I gave evidence on the side of the Fire-office—I have not assisted in getting up this case or subpoenaing witnesses—the man Jacobs did not recover his claim—he did not recover one farthing on his stock—the mortgagee recovered his amount but the man nothing Q When Mr Miers went away did you expect he had gone away to come back in a few days A If you will allow me to explain—when information came to the police of goods being left at the coffee-shop and they came to tell me they thought they were goods abstracted from the fire I said How do you know it is the same person let him make his claim to the goods and then we shall know but you may go and take up an innocent man —I did not see the policeman after the prisoner went away—I had my doubts whether the prisoner was the man who had left the parcels—I always had my doubt of it MR KELLY Q Did you apply to the police or did they come to you A They came to me most earnestly urging his being taken—I set my face against it and endeavoured all I could to dissuade them—it was contrary to my wish that any policeman came and took him The claim No 1 made by the prisoner was here read in part The account of stock was as follows — STOCK ACCOUNT Dr £ s d Value of stock as taken on the 31st of Aug 1836 as per stock-book 2910 8 0 To goods purchased since the above date as per vouchers 2587 16 8 To ditto in smaller sums

GEORGE TAYLOR I live at No 29 Molyneaux-street which is about half a mile from High-street—one end of it comes into Queen-street and the other leads to Edgware-road On the night of Saturday the 20th of January last I happened to be at the corner of Weymouth-street between twenty and twenty-five minutes past twelve o clock—it leads into High-street—I knew the house that was occupied by the prisoner before it was burnt down—it was at the corner of a street called Bowling-street in High-street on the northern side of Bowling-street—Bowling-street runs into High-street—I observed smoke issuing from the shutters carrying a smell of fire with it—I knocked at the shutters but received no answer and I went to the private door—I knocked at the private door and was answered by a female who I supposed to be a servant—she came to the door—it was Ann Wright—when she opened the door I asked if there was any thing the matter in the shop—she answered It is a hit of an accident —I looked into the shop and saw it was full of smoke—I went into the passage and looked through a door which was half glazed—that was open and I could look into the shop—I saw smoke coming from underneath the stall board of the window—I said to the girl why did she not give some alarm—I thought the place was all on fire—there was a good deal of smoke in the shop—I observed some woollen goods or shawls hanging up in the shop and observed an appearance of light through the shawls—I saw one two or three lights—they were in different parts of the shop—I staid there about five minutes—I did not see the prisoner or any part of the family but the servant—I left and went to the adjoining house—the fire appeared to grow up very rapidly indeed—when I first observed it in the shop it was nothing more than smoke and in less than five minutes after it was all in a flame—there were gas burners in the shop—I did not observe any fire coming from under the stall-board when I first went but I did about a quarter of an hoar after when I returned—two gas-burners appeared to be nearly over the stall-board and one to be nearly over the counter—I did not observe any flame at all near the stall-board when my attention was first called to the smoke under it but I did when I came back the second time—it was then all in a blaze—I gave an alarm to Mr Bicknells next door—when I first observed the smoke issuing from the shutters I was outside Q Was there a considerable quantity or a small quantity of smoke when you first observed it A It appeared to be coming over the whole of the shutters at the crevices at the top—I smelt fire as well—the smoke appeared to come in considerable quantities when I first saw it Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q This was between twelve and one o clock in the morning I believe A It was—the shatters were closed—I was not able to discern a light between the crevices only the smoke pouring through similar to coming from a baker s shop—I believe there were several shawls in the shop suspended on lines—I did not see any light from fire at first—I could not see the shawls afterwards—I saw a gas lamp burning at first—I saw that through the shawls—the shawls appeared to be hung across the gas lamp MR Clarkson Q Then according to your notion did the gas appear to be burning in the proper gas-light A It did—I am positive of it and that I observed through the shawls JOHN SIMMONDS I was a policeman in January last I was on duty on the night of the 20th of that month in High-street and about half-past twelve o clock a servant-girl came to me and gave an alarm of fire—I went immediately to Mr Miers s house and went in at the side-door in Bowling-street—that door opens into a passage and then there is a glass door which opens into the shop—the shop-door is in High-street—when I went in at the private door I looked through the glass door and saw fire burning on the left-hand counter as I went in—it was a very small light I should say about a foot above the counter—Mr Miers was in the passage as I went in—the same passage by which I entered—he was dressed the same as I am now all but his hat—he had no hat on—his wife was with him—as I stood the fire was on my left hand at the stall-board or counter GEORGE TAYLOR re-examined Q What is the thing you call the stallboard from under which you saw the smoke coming A The bottom of a shop-window made for goods to show JOHN SIMMONDS continued The fire appeared to me to be on the counter—I saw distinctly the fire on the counter and a small blaze on the top of it—that was all I observed at that moment—Mr and Mrs Miers were in the passage and Mr Miers said to me Do what you can my shop is on fire —I then immediately inquired for some water and he said We have not got a drop we are entirely frozen out —at this time the smoke was very dense—in the meantime while inquiring for some water the servant girl brought up a small bucket of water—I threw that on the flames as well as I could—I then inquired for some more and while I was passing the tub back the girl brought a second pail of water—I threw that in the same place but found it had no effect whatever—I then said the best way would be to go away—the people outside had broken does the shutters and let the draught in and the flames were bursting about—I saw Mr Miers give his wife I cannot say what but it appeared to me like a box—I dare say it was about the length of this testament—it was like a small tea-caddy—I can compare it to nothing else—there were some papers in it and he said to her My dear be careful of this —I immediately went out as the smoke was so bad and that was all I saw Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you take Mr and Mrs Miers out with you or did they go out A They went out I suppose—I did not take them out—it was not safe to stay there—the phrase Miers used to me was Do what you can for me my shop is on fire —nothing else Q On the oath you have taken was it not this Policeman for God s sake do what you can my shop is on fire A Well it was to a similar effect—I did not think you would come so close to me—I have told you the plain truth—I have left the police—if you will inquire of the Commissioners they will explain why I shall not tell you unless his Lordship requests it COURT You had better answer it MR PHILLIPS Q Why have you left the police A I dare say it is what you have been addicted to yourself—taking a drop too much—now I have told you—I was dismissed for drunkenness Q How many complaints had been made against you before you were finally dismissed A Am I bound to answer that —if you will inquire of the Commissioners they will tell you—I cannot—they might be so many—I cannot tell you How many—if you ask the Commissioners that will do Q They were so many you cannot say A You may have it your own way—I shall not say any thing of the kind—I dare say there might be three complaints JEREMIAH BROWN I am a hair-dresser and live at No 16 Great Marylebone-street which leads into High-street On the night of the he I was in Wimpole-street and heard some person calling Fire —I found the fire was at the prisoner s shop—it was about a quarter after twelve o clock—there was a policeman there and somebody dressed in plain clothes who I believe was the witness Taylor—I saw smoke coming from the top part of the shutters—I did not observe the private door at that moment—I did within a minute after—it was in Bowling-street—it was men then but I do not think it was open when I first went up—I went and got to the counter—I could discover a fire but there was a number things hanging about my head and the room was full of smoke—I palled as many things down off the lines as I could about fifteen or twenty number—they were fancy woollen shawls and cloaks and things—had been in the shop once before and knew the situation of it—I observed fire in the left-hand corner of the shop pointing to High-street—appeared almost as if it was some linen caught a light—it was not so at the stall-board of the window not so high as the counter when I went in—as I pulled the things down I could feel the counter quite to the window—the smoke was so much I drew the things down—fire was on the ground—I should not think it had got up above two from the ground—it very soon entirely consumed the shop—I took things out and returned but did not get any more out—I had been the shop about a fortnight before that night—I had gone there to purchase something—I observed shelves about the shop when I went then—I did not make any observations as to the state of the shop—I consider was a small shop and I should think there was very little stock in it from that I could see—I was not able to obtain what I wanted—while I was here two ladies came in and asked for black silk stockings—Mr Miers in the shop—a parcel was shown to the ladies containing black silk lockings—there were but two pairs as far as I could see—I saw no others produced to the ladies—they asked if he had any more—he said the quality of those was very good he had no more and the ladies went way—I went to buy a piece of mattress binding but did not get it—did sot make any remark to my wife when I got home as to the state if the shop Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS —Q What was the sum you intended lay out for the article you went to buy A I believe it is only about 5d or 16d a piece and I wanted half a piece that would be 7 1/2 d —I was the shop before the ladies came in—I stood on one side to allow them to be served before me—I will swear I saw only two pairs of stockings in the parcel—I will not swear there was not three—I do not know whether I have always said that the ladies asked if he had more—his was rather before January—there was a very severe frost—I am quite sure I made no remark to my wife when I went home—some of the helves were nearly full of goods or they might be full—I could not swear that—many of them were nearly or quite empty—I will not swear whether many of them were full or not MR CLARKSON Q Did you observe that the shop was very indifferently stocked A I did—there were a great many empty shelves GEORGE MARRIOTT I am an assistant jailer at Bow-street I saw passing near Mr Miers s house on the night of the fire from a quarter half-past twelve—I could not say to five minutes—I saw smoke coming out at the door in Bowling-street—I shoved at the door and saw Miers and a lady in the passage—I said The house is on fire —locking to my left hand I saw things burning in the shop at the left hand side the shop—it appeared to me that there was fire—things on fire at the had of the counter and at the side of the counter—Mr and Mrs Miers we standing in the passage at least a gentleman and lady—they were nothing at all—I did not go into the shop—I attempted to go up stairs think J went up two stairs or it might be three—before I attempted to up I asked if any persons were up stairs were there no lives to be saw—Mr and Mrs Miers were both standing there together and Mrs Miers said nobody was in the house but their two selves and the servant and servant was gone to look for a policeman—I continued there a very minutes—when I had gone up two stairs I came back and went out—did not see Mr and Mrs Miers after I came down the stairs—I met policeman with a pail of water in his hand—I said to him April water is of no use —I cannot say what he did with it—I did not see thing more than the policeman with the pail of water after I had come down—I ran to the door and inquired if the engines and turncock were and went out of the house—I stopped about there till five o clock in morning or between four and five—I should say the house was down in less than an hour—I think so Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You were not before the magistrate I believe A I was not JOHN COX DEAN I am one of the firm of Orchard and Dean ironmongers in High-street My house is about forty yards from the house when was occupied by Miers on the other side of the way—I heard from my house an alarm of fire—I got up and went to the spot—the shop should were not down when I got there they were up—I assisted in barring them—they fell outside and I saw the flames issuing from shop—the flames and smoke were too intense to admit of my seeing the shop and I do not think I could form any judgment of what was in the shop Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Were you before the magistrate A I was not JOHN THOMAS CLAREDGE I lodge at No 27 Weymouth-street which I think about sixty yards from Mr Miers s house I did not know he Miers personally previous to the fire—I had seen him at his door—I do not know that any one lodging in the same house with me know him—on the night of the fire I went to Mr Miers s house about half past twelve—there was a man in a Mackintosh cloak Mr Miers and the policeman there—directly after I entered the house Mrs Miers came down stairs—she went to the house where I lodge—after taking Mrs Miers then I went out again to the fire and about three o clock when I went home Mr Miers was sitting by the side of Mrs Miers by the fire—Mrs Miers had remained there from the time of the fire till about a quarter after there o clock when they left—I found them together there when I went in—they were in deep conversation which was principally carried on in whispers—they did not appear to be at all agitated—they appeared so calm and collected that I mentioned it to somebody—they staid about a quarter of an or twenty minutes after I got in and then went away—I asked the prisoner if he had any idea of what was the cause of the fire—he said he had whatever that he closed the shop about half-past eleven o clock and not in it again until after the alarm of fire was given—I did not ask him other question—they went away from our house in a coach Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you see Mrs Miers when came down stairs A Yes—her stays were exposed and her hair was paper—one paper on each side Mr KELLY Q Was there any shawl about her A She had a inside her stays WILLIAM BAYLIS I am a stationer living at No 4 Bowling-street I opened to be coming up High-street at the time of the fire about half-past twelve o clock or a little after—it was before the axe had showed itself when I first came up I had not observed the least appearance of fire—I home and had undressed myself—I was getting into bed when I and the alarm of fire—I immediately put on my clothes and went down I know Mr Charlton s door—it is No 3 Bowling-street next door to and opposite Miers s—Charlton s house is opposite Miers s premises—her the fire bad been put out I saw the prisoner standing leaning ainst Charlton s shutters with his hands in his pocket in a very cool and date sort of manner—I asked him if his family were all out—he said Yes in a very low tone of voice they are down the court —I then ked him if he had saved his property—he said No I have saved noing but two books —I asked him if he was aware How the fire occurred me was aware of the origin of the fire—he told me yes it was caused the gas—he said then that he had sent to the gas-fitter to come to ease cock of the gas pipe—he mentioned the gas-fitter s name—the name of refries—he said he had tried to turn the gas off but could not—he said ho sent eight or ten times within the last month and the man had neglected to come—I said If it had been my case I would have sent for other gas-fitter and not waited for him —he said he had broken three says in endeavouring to turn it off Q Pray do you among other articles deal in coarse brown paper used for king parcels of linen in A I do—on the Monday before the fire Mr fiers had purchased some of that sort of paper of me—I had sold one quantity to him which had been previously looked out by his young man Midgley I have frequently observed in shop-windows in London bills notifying at goods are to be sold off—before the fire I had observed a great number of such bills in Miers s shop—it is twenty-two yards and a half from the centre of the threshold of my door to the centre of the threshold of Mr fiers s—that is the private door across the way—I remember the morning of at Christmas-day—I was up early that morning as is my usual custom I was up a quarter before six o clock and was at the shop door—at that me it was dark—there were gas-lights in the neighbourhood—I observed coach draw up to Miers s door about ten minutes before six o clock—had the curiosity to watch it and observed a man and one or two females come from the private door—I observed them get into the coach several and I observed that they had parcels in their hands—the only male person that I consider I knew was Mr Miers—I saw him—I saw him come from the private door to the coach several times each time having a parcel—the private door remained open—I know the person of the servant—I saw her standing on the step of the door—some of the parcels were larger than others—some appeared about the size of that box— a box or table of the Court —and others larger—I observed the person who placed many parcels in and who I believe to be Mr Miers get into the coach and appeared to me but I am not really positive that a female got in also him—whether there was a second female got in with him I cannot tively say—as soon as the door was shut the coach went off past my along Weymouth-street Cross-examined by MR THOMAS Q You live very near Mr Miers A Yes just across the way—I am a newsman and am generally up early in the morning— producing a plan —this is my house and that Miers s—I never on any other occasion saw a hackney coach taking goods—I have seen things going away but not by coach—I sold his quire of brown paper on the Monday previous to the fire—I suppose used that sort of paper in packing parcels—I did not go across when I the coach—I thought it possible he might be going on a visit and yet was doubtful whether it was so—I do not say that I stated when I examined before that my suspicions were not excited that I thought was going to spend a day in the country—I thought it possible that were going out to spend the Christmas-day—there was nothing to my going across and seeing what they were about MR CLARKSON Q Were you on such terms with Mr Miers as to at liberty to go and examine the coach or look into his hands A I have done so but I should have thought it very rude NATHAN DEFRIES I live at No 41 Paddington-street and am an gineer and gas-fitter I knew Mr Miers s house—I fitted up gas-fitting in his shop referring to memoranda on March 26th 1837—soon after house was fitted up Mr Miers complained of a smell—I attended to and after two or three examinations found that the carpenter had drives nail through a brass pipe—I remedied that soon after the 26th of march—the last time I made any repairs in gas-fittings was as near as possible six months ago from this time—I cannot say in what month—it was so trilling it was not booked—I sent my man—I never work myself—I have that had an application from the prisoner to repair a key—when I say repair it it was not so the pendant was loose in the ceiling in consequest of the carpenter not screwing the branch up and that was repaired—the was six months ago—I have not been applied to by Mr Miers since that make any repairs in the gas work Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you go yourself to Mr Miers A I did in one instance—I was sent for but once—I cannot say who it called—my clerk took the message—he is not here—his name is Freeman—he has left me—I sent a man named Lewis to repair the gas fitting—he not here—that was the occasion I went to Mr Miers in person—there was male lodger living with him—I do not know his name—I saw a man then on the first floor—I cannot tell where he lodged—my clerk never went to Mr Miers to my knowledge—I never received but one message—if move than one came it must have come to my hearing—I have no doubt it would have been booked or slated—it was the job that was too slight to he booked but the order must be entered on the slate or book—that is my strict orders—my orders were not disobeyed on that occasion—it was either booked or slated—I cannot say whether it was booked or not—I have books at home—I cannot venture to say what distance Mr Miers resides from me—it is not very far—if a gas pipe is not properly repaired it discharges the gas so as to emit a very unpleasant smell which would be offensive to house MR CLARKSON Q If a message had been sent to you eight or ten somes in the course of the month the fire happened according to the way our business is done must it have come to your knowledge A Most recidedly WILLIAM GATTRELL On the 23rd of December last and from April to at time I lived with the prisoner Mr Miers as shop-boy—I quitted on a saturday—at that time my master carried on business in High-street—the second-floor front room the kitchen and the back parlour were all the rooms the house that were furnished at that time—there was a closet with just enough to hold a bedstead—the second-floor front room was furnished it a bed-room—when I went there in April there were no other furnished comes than those I have named—I know Midgley—when I first went to with Mr Miers Midgley was his assistant—I went in April and Midgley left about two months after I should think—he was to take a shop in rawford-street—Midgley s wife is sister to Mrs Miers my master s life—Midgley was succeeded by a man named Govier—I think he retained about a fortnight or six weeks—during that time Mr Miers was taken ill and was confined to his bed—after Govier left a man named homas Davey became assistant—he staid I think about a month or six seeks—on some few occasions within the last month I was there I remember customers making applications for things and going away with—it them—when persons made applications for things he had not got Mr liers said he should get them in on such a day but he did not get them at all—I noticed that at the time—it was my business to attend in the up Q How much money should you say was taken over the counter in a ly in November or December to speak liberally A I should say about one day with another—I used to go to the till for change when I wanted—during the latter months I was there I heard the prisoner complain of rade many times—during the latter part of my time in his service Mr liers used generally to go out between eight and nine o clock in the morning and return about nine or ten o clock at night—he staid away freuently all day in the course of the last two months—he used to return sometimes before and sometimes after the shop was shut at night—during he latter three or four months of my time he was very little in the shop—was customary for the shop to be supplied with pins tape worsted and cotton balls about every three weeks according to the course of justness Q During the time you were there from April to December was there my considerable supply of goods linen and such stock as that A He used to have some calico in—I do not know from whom—he had not much while I was there—I do not know at what time the calico came in—he ways used to keep a supply of calico in—there used to be some Irish men on the top row of shelves—before I left they had been sent away—occupied all the top row or part of it on one side of the shop and at the pack—when they went away the shelves were supplied with dummies which are bits of wood tied up in blue paper representing linen—the shawls were kept in two or three drawers the drawers were kept under the counter—we had no boxes of shawls—he had some in linen wrappers—some of the shawls were sent away about the latter part of my time—I have heard my master speak of Miss York—she served in Mr Miers s shop for a week—she was a sister of Mrs Miers—my master used to tell me what goods look out to send down to a shop at Isleworth which Miss York kept—it was supplied from Mr Miers s stock—all sorts of haberdashery was sent—there was a great deal sent the latter part of the time I was ther—the were tied up in coarse wrappers to go there—they were sent once a week and sent by the carrier—I remember in September last some goods going in a phaeton Mr Miers and myself put them in—there were flannek linens shawls and different goods in haberdashery—they were taken away in the morning on a work-day—about ten or eleven o clock in the morning the phaeton came to the private door in Bowling-street—the goods sent away without being packed—I was sent to Midgley in Crawford street after he took the shop there—I went with goods not more than or six times—I carried them myself—they were middling-sized parced half as large again as that box—I used sometimes to take one sometime two—Midgley was in the habit of coming to and from the shop and it was at the time he was going to open the shop that these goods were sent—there were no fresh supplies of flannel and linen during the latter part the time I was with Mr Miers—the stock became diminished by send ing these goods away—towards the latter part of my time the shop ill stocked there were very few goods in it—I cannot form any idea of the value of the goods in the shop—I know Mr Defries the gafitter—I was sent to him by my master in the summer—there was a escape of gas in the window in the branch-pipe the message was to repaired it—I delivered the message—Mr Defries sent a man and repaired it—I was sent to Mr Defries before that—the last time I was sent was in summer—I had never been sent since the summer of last year—when I was sent the man came and did what was required—from time I went in the summer I never heard or received directions from master to go for Mr Defries—I did not hear my master during the part of my time make any complaint about the gas—there was no other person to go on messages from June to December when I left him—master closed his shop at ten o clock on work-days in the week and on saturday nights between eleven and twelve o clock—I used to put the out on Saturday nights as well as other nights—I always turned it out regularly—I left my master because I did not suit him—I could not do work well enough for him—I had to clean the gas glasses in the window of the shop that was what I did not do to his satisfaction—that was the reason he parted with me—he said I did not go on his errands quickly enough—I was not charged with dishonesty of any kind—there was other reason but not going on errands quickly enough and not cleaning the glasses Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Of course you were examined before the Magistrate A Yes—I have been examined on this business before to-day—I was before the Justice at the Police Office in High-street Marylebone—I think that is about six weeks ago—I was not sworn there—I gave evidence to Mr Rawlinson and he took it down in writing—he did not read it over to me—an officer called at my father s for me to take me to High-street to be examined—I know

was—it was not a woman or a child took me to the room—it was man took me—he had the appearance of a gentleman—he did not tell one what he wanted with me—I think he found me at my place in Oxford-street—he might have found me there—I do not know How far he took me fore we got to this gentleman s house—I do not know whether the man went into the room with me where I found the gentleman Q

gas in the window—I am not sure whether I told Mr Defries or the man that—I did see Mr Defries at his own house—I do not know what I told him—I went to him because there was another escape of gas between the flooring—the times are intermixed—I cannot say what message I gave the first or last time—I went to him on account of some escape of gas etch time—being saucy to Mrs Midgley was the reason I was discharged—when I lived with Mr Miers I used to sleep up in some room called the ware-house on the other side of the yard Q Did you find yourself two or three different nights from your home

COURT Q Why not state all this when the other gentleman asked you A I did not know the gentleman s name MR KELLY Q You have been asked if there was anybody else in the same room or office do you remember who took you in there A I went and knocked at the door and a clerk opened the door—that is the person—he showed me into the office—I could not see anybody if they were outside the railing—I

he put the gas fights out or lowered them A No I cannot say—I do not remember one way or the other—when he had had his supper and shut up the shop went up stairs with my mistress—that was at ten minutes or a quarter after twelve o clock—I remained with my mistress from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes before Mr Miers came up—during that time he down below alone—he then came up—I remained up stairs about five minutes after he came up—I remained in the room—I then went down stairs with the warming-pan in my hand—when I got down I observed he curtain was undrawn and a large worsted needle stuck in the curtain—seeing the reflection in the glass I looked on the counter and saw a light was a muslin curtain to the glass-door which separates the parlour from the shop—the bottom part of the door is wood—the curtain of that door was undrawn—I looked through the glass-door and saw a light on the left-hand side of the counter—as you look through the glass-door the counter is on the left-hand side—there were two windows to the shop—the window was near the end of the counter—there were two counters—the light was at the left-hand counter near the end near the window—there were some prints hanging and there was a light as if it went from these prints and they were in a flame—when I saw the fire I called to master twice please Sir will you come down stairs —the door was

pail and a foot tub with two handles—I had put the water in the tub for the next day s use—I had got the water out of the wash-house which was up stairs in the yard in a large water-butt—I could not draw the water out of the tap—I dipped it out with a jug—the water was frozen—I brought the water and gave it to the policeman—I then went up stairs for mistress s cloak and bonnet but I could not get the closet open where her bonnet was kept—I went down with the cloak and master told me to go into the back warehouse with mistress and I went out with he—I did not remain more than a minute after I brought the policeman in—I went with my mistress to a neighbour named Watkins but I did not stop there when mistress was there—I did not stop long in the parlour—I went after the engine to Marylebone station-house—I went of myself after that Mr and Mrs Miers had a coach and Mr Miers left me at any own home at three o clock in the morning and was to let me know when to come to them—he came on Monday and told me to go and on a Tuesday morning I went to my mistress in Ingram-court Fenchurch-street the house of Mr Bustin—he is a relation of Mr Miers s I believe—I mained there I think a fortnight with mistress—I staid there till the Campbell the policeman came—Mr and Mrs Miers remained there also—I went into Mr Miers s service on the 15th of November Q Did Mr Miers get any quantity of goods in after you went in November—was there any considerable quantities of goods brought into the shop A No I did not see any—I think if there had been any large quantity I should have seen them—I could see into the shop through the glass door and when my master had no man I used to watch the shop door while master and mistress were at dinner—I did not serve in the shop—the shelves were not full some of them had two or three things on and the others were not full—the shop was not well stocked Q You say you did not see any large quantities of things come in you know of any thing going

went for a coach and the coach came between six and seven o clock—Mr Midgley had come on the Saturday as Chirstmasday was on Monday—on the Sunday the day before Christmas-day master and Mr Midgley his brother-in-law were at work in the shop from eleven till six o clock—they were measuring things off—some were in wrappers and some in brown paper—there were some merinos measured off on the parlour table on the Sunday and some table linen I saw on the counter and things—some of them were large parcels—when the coach came on Christmas morning master placed the parcels on the stairs and left them there till he came back with the coach and I gave the parcels to him—one side of the coach was full and part of the other—master went on one side of the coach with the parcels—they were heavy parcels and of different sizes—two or three were large parcels—some of them were much larger but none so small as this box—they were packed in coarse brown paper and some with wrappers—some were the length of a long cane—all the parcels that master had placed on the stairs were put into the each—nobody went with him then—the coachman and he drove away—did not hear where he was going—his wife did not go with him—he came back about half-past twelve or twenty-five minutes to one o clock—he then went up stairs to dress and dined with Mrs in Whitechapel and mistress went with him—I do not remember any goods coming into the shop after Christmas-day Q Now do you remember during the time you were there any other goods going away A At the time Mrs Midgley went away before Christmas morning there were two trunks and master took some parcels hen but I did not look at the size of them—one trunk was a black one and the other a coloured paper one—I do not know from my master whether he went the night before the fire to Ingram-court—he went out on Friday but I cannot say to any time—during the latter part of the time I was there my master was not much at home—he did not spend much time in paying attention to his shop during the latter part of the time—not more than usual—mistress attended to the shop and master went out—a lad was hired as shop-boy and came on the Friday before the fire and went away on the Saturday afternoon—his Christian name was John his other name I do not Know—I did not hear my master say who he was or any thing about him—he went away on Saturday and was to return at six o clock on Saturday but he did not return—that was the night of the fire Q Had you the means of knowing from living in the house as the only servant what articles of furniture and what things there were in ordinary use in the house A Yes—there was a bedstead in the back room second floor—there was not any set of Merino curtains and drapery there was no such article in the house—there were short muslin curtains —there was a mattress but no palliasse—there was not eighteen yards of damask carpetting—there were some pieces of carpet put down but no damask—they were old pieces of stair-carpet—there was no hearth-rug nor any chest of mahogany drawers—there were not four rose-wood chairs—there were three chairs but no window-curtains in the back room—there were no toilet covers in that room nor any cut-glass bottle and tumbler or japanned towel horses—there was no towel horse at all in that room—there was no easy chair with chintz cover in the front room second floor—there was one pair of large blankets but not two pairs—there was one large thick blanket and one under blanket—three blankets altogether—there was no mahogany cheffionier—there was no blue breakfast service in the kitchen—there were four large breakfast cups and saucers and basin to match—two of them were kept up stairs—there were no small cups and saucers in general use—there were not so many as thirty-four of any thing of a blue breakfast service or other service at all—the breakfast cups and saucers were common willow pattern—there was no small tea service—master and mistress always used the large cups and saucers—there were china cups and saucers always kept in the parlour closet—there was a large tea-kettle in use—the copper tea-kettle was not used often and it was not large—there

no wine-bin with shelves—there was no spirits brandy or gin Q what number of books were there in the house altogether A The best books which I have seen were kept up stairs on the toilet cover—what I have seen in the parlour was Chambers s Edinburgh Journal but only a few of them—there were no books in any place besides the toilet in the bed room and the parlour—I should say there were not more than a dozen volumes up stairs but there was a closet over the parlour with numbers of Chambers s Journal in it—I have seen very few books only numbers—I mean unstitched books—there were no books in the parlour no volumes only numbers—I should say it was not possible for 109 volumes of printed books to be in the house or any thing like that number—there were about a dozen and no more up stairs and some unbound numbers of Chambers s Journal —I have seen two or three taken to read from the closed in the parlour—that was the first time I ever saw them—that was one Sunday evening when master went out and mistress came home with master—Mr Midgley had them reading—there was no rose-wood sofa table in the front room second floor—there was no linen-press with shelves in that room nor any chintz drapery for three windows with brass supporters—there were only two windows to the front room—there was no chintz drapery—there were some muslin curtains in the back parlour but they were not up—there were none at all in the front room—Mrs Miers bad not any rich silk cloak—only the black silk cloak she had on on the night of the fire when she went to Fenchurch-street—she had no boa—she had a muff which was moth-eaten very much—I was desired to take it out into the wash house and beat it but I did not beat it then—I was desired to do that a week or a fortnight before the fire—at the time of the fire it was in the box—it was not fit to wear—there was no boa in the house—there were five pairs of sheets and six table-cloths sent away with Mrs Midgley in a coach—at the time of the fire there were only the sheets on the beds except the sheets that went to the wash—there was master s bed and the bed I slept on—there was a pair of sheets to the bed the boy slept on in the ware house—they were on the bed at the time—I do not know whether my master had any gold watch—I did not hear him speak of any gold watch till he was in Fenchurch-street—I then heard him speak of one—he was making the inventory of the things lost in the fire and he named about the watch to me then—he asked if I had seen the gold watch—I said No I had not seen it—only a small silver watch he had in use with a chain—he was writing down on paper the things that were lost—there was no gold watch in the house that I saw—I never saw one at all in the house nor ever heard of his having one in his possession—it was a week ten days it a fortnight before Christmas that Mrs Midgley took the trunks away Q Was there any plate taken away in those trunks A Yes two table-spoons two salt-spoons six tea-spoons and a fish-slice—I did not see any plate in the house after they went away—the metal table and teaspoons were always used after that—in the black trunk there were five pairs of sheets and six table-cloths and some pillow-cases—I do not know How many—I did not see any of those things come back—my master went with Mrs Midgley when those things were taken away—I was present in Ingram-court when master was making out the inventory—he described to me a sofa-table—I did not know at the time what one was but when he described it I had seen what he described a table with two leaves and drawers—I remembered that I had seen such a table but there was no sofatable in the house at the time of the fire—he also named to me a sofa but there was no sofa in the house—master was writing down when I said there was none in the house—he told me if I was asked if there was a sofatable I was to say yes if they asked me at the Insurance office—this was on the Tuesday the day he desired me to go to Ingram-court—nothing else passed between us at that time—he said he had the sofa-table in Oxford-street but it was sold when they came to High-street—he also mentioned having a polished steel fender and fire-irons in Oxford-street—there were no such things in High-street Q Were you sent at any time in February to Surrey-place A Yes one Sunday morning after the fire—it was about a fortnight after the fire I went to No 30 Surrey-place Old Kent-road—it was a linen-draper s shop—I saw Mrs Midgley there and her sister Miss York and Mrs York—Mrs Midgley and Miss York served in the shop—the next night Mrs Midgley and Miss York and a child came to Ingram-court Cross-examined by MR JAMES Q Can you write A No—my master made out the list of the kitchen utensils which were burnt—I furnished him with a list of the articles and master added more things to it—master told me to recollect what was in the kitchen—a young man in the house where my mother lived wrote down the articles as I told him—he was not a friend of mine—I had seen him before—I cannot think of his name—you can hear of him at No 37 Ogle-street Marylebone on the first floor—I cannot tell what business he is—he is a neighbour of my father s—he lives at No 37 Ogle-street—I was in Ogle-street at my father s one evening and the person wrote it out and master saw it and added more things to it—I can read plain writing—I did not read that list—I took it to my master after it was written—master told me and mistress to recollect if there was any thing more—I cannot say whether he old me I had not recollected all—I know there were more things added—master had papers before him—I cannot say what they were—some of them seemed bills—I could not read them—there were two chests of drawers in the room up stairs and there was a Bible and prayer-book and two other books and a desk on those drawers—there were two books one small and one smaller—some of the books were lettered on the back—on the table were smaller books—I can read the letters at the backs of books—one of the books was Clark s Prayers or something—there was the name of Clark on the back of a book—I cannot say whether it was on the sack of one or two—it was a small Bible and prayer-book—they had marks on them—there was not more than one prayer-book that I know of—I do not recollect Johnson s Dictionary or two volumes of Cowper s Poems—I did not look at them all and could not tell—I do not recollect them—the closets in the house were not locked—the chests of drawers were locked—one was master s and one was mistress s—mistress had the care of the linen—the muslin curtains which were not put up were rough—dried and put on the shelf in master s bed-room—the short muslin curtain remained at the parlour window—there were two japanned towel-horses in master s bed-room which was the front room on the second floor—they could be moved from one room to another but they always remained in master s bed-room next the window—there was one pair of sheets use for master s bed one pair for mine and one pair for the boy s—I do not know How many pairs there were in the drawers—I have seen the drawers open—there were no sheets in them—they were all kept on a shelf in master s bed-room closet—I had seen the drawers open in the week—my mistress s was a squirrel muff—I had not seen my mistress with a boa—I have seen her with a short ruff but not a box—it was not a squirrel ruff it was a plain one—I never saw her me the muff—it was not fit for use Q Do you recollect Mr Walters dining with your master A Yes he dined there often on a Tuesday—I cannot say How recently before the 20th of January he dined there—it might be a week or a fortnight or two or three weeks—I waited at table on that occasion and attended as servant—I was in and out—metal table-spoons and tea-spoons were used on that occasion the same as usual—at times the gas-lamps in the shop were left burning all night—they were left low not full but about one-third the usual height—I did not observe the lights left so till after I had been there some name—I went up stairs with my mistress about ten minutes after twelve o clock as near as I can say on the night of the fire—we went up stairs together Q Did you take the keys of the shop with you A Mistress s combs were in the candle-stick—as to the keys I cannot say but I took the keys from the toilet and gave them to master in the bed-room—I found then on the drawers near master s bedside—there were two keys tied together with a string—master always took the keys of the shop up—they were usually placed on the candlestick or on the drawers or on the looking glass—I found them on the drawers—I cannot say positively that the keys were not taken up in the candlestick or by my mistress in her hand—I left mistress in bed when I left the room undressed as usual—when I went up with mistress I left master in the parlour and master gave me a shilling to go for a shilling s-worth of brandy which I got in a mug—when I discovered the fire the parlour door was open which goes into the parlour—I could see the reflection of the glass—the door was Jocked which leads from the parlour into the shop—that door was usually locked—the parlour door itself was open Q Had you retired or got down into the kitchen with the warning pan before your master went up A I did not go farther than parlour before I called my master—my master had his coat and waistcoat off before I left the bed-room—I was in the room about five minutes after he came of—I did not stop longer than giving him the keys and going out—I gave him the two keys which unlock the shop door—I found them on the drawers next the bed-side—that does not enable me to recollect whether my mistress had them taken up—I cannot say—I do not know whether they went up or not but I found them on the drawers and gave them to my master—the boy who came on the Friday was called John—he was a boy who had applied in the shop as errand-boy—he had seen a bill I believe in the window—there was an advertisement for a boy in the window—he left on the Saturday—he was to return at six o clock but he did not return—he went for some things—the kitchen was below the shop down a pair of stairs—that was more usually my place than the shop—it was in the front—there was a wash-house—I was not engaged there only when I was washing my things—I only washed once a week—it was possible to bring goods into the shop without my seeing them—I said no large quantities were brought—the shop was not well stocked as linen-drapers usually are—I had nothing to do with the shop—the kettle was not a large one—it was a middling-sized one—I did not tell the gentleman at Ogle-street to put down a large one—I saw no quantities of goods come in a coach—whether a parcel or a hamper came I cannot tell—I did not trouble myself about the shop—if I was in the kitchen I could hear any large parcel come in by the weight —if I was in the wash-house of course I could not hear—I do not mean to swear that no goods did come in—the lace was kept in boxes in the shop—I have seen the boxes as they have been serving—the boxes were the size of those books there—I cannot say whether they were kept in blue cartridge-paper cases—there were no merino window-curtains there—I was not there when Mr Smith the lodger was there—whether the room was furnished with merino curtains while he was there I do not know—there were no lumber trunks in master s bed-room—there was a closet leading out of master s bed-room with a lumber trunk there—there were holland blinds to the windows—there was no cornice—there was a piece of flat wood on the top of the window on which the curtains would rest but there were no curtains up Q Did you ever look into the trunk A I took a counterpane out or the kitchen the same kind of counterpane as the boy had in the ware-house—there were no curtains in the trunk at that time—there were old tassels there which looked dirty—they were not moreen—tassels are not made of moreen—they were a lightish colour but dusty and old not fit to put up—it was small worsted fringe—that is not in general used to moreen curtains—they are generally trimmed with velvet—it depends on the taste of the person—there were tassels but not much of them—I have seen worsted tassels used with moreen curtains but they are not used now MR KELLY Q You have been asked about Mr Smith the lodger when did he come A I do not know it was before my time—there was no lodger in my time—Mr Walters dined with my matter—he is lace-maker—he served master—he has dined there several times—he was intimate with master—there was lace in the shop at the time of the fire—there were caps and lace hanging on the lines in the shop—I do not know any thing of their value MR JAMES Q In what state was the window of the shop left at night were the things hanging up A The window was left the same as master dressed it in the day—the articles which hung there in the day hung there all night—I cannot say whether the lamps were burning—master dressed the window on Friday and it was left the same on Saturday night—I cannot say whether the lamps were left burning low on that night but they have been left so often since William Gattrell left the service The following is a list of the articles referred to by this witness and included in the claim made by the prisoner Back room second floor set of moreen curtains furniture drapery &c to bedstead 5l 10s mattress and palliasse 2l 10s eighteen yards of damask carpetting 2l

the wife of George Russell I wag in the habit before the 20th of January last of going to the prisoner s house changing and in the course of the time I was there I became acquainted with the lines in the different rooms of the house—about six months before the fire I was there for a fortnight or three weeks—the parlour was furnished—the first-floor back room was not furnished it was entirely empty and the first floor front too was quite empty the prisoner occupied the second floor front room as his bed room—I removed the furniture out of the second floor back room down stairs during the floor tnight or three weeks that was charing there—there was a stump elm bedstead a little upright washing stand a deal table two mattresses and a common looking-glass—I know the sort of wooden rollers that it is common for linen-drapers to have silk on—there were none in the second-floor back room—they were in the warehouse at the hack of the house—that was the place I removed the furniture to from the back room second floor—I do not recollect any thing else that I removed from there—there were several wooden rollers in the warehouse—I think I removed those articles about a week before I left—it was the first week I was there—there was a room over the warehouse that was at the back of the premises—a yard divided it—there was only a sort of loft and a bed-room over the warehouse for the boy—there was a stump bedstead there of the same sort as had been in the back room on the second floor—there was also a common deal washing stand a plain deal table a flock bed and I think three blankets and two bolsters there—there was no furniture in the rooms higher than the second floor—only one of the kitchens were furnished—there were two white dimity curtains to the bed which the prisoner occupied—there was no valance to the top of the bed there was to the bottom—the furniture of the house was all common furniture Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q I suppose you only speak from recollection of the things—you took no account of any A No—it is nearly nine months ago since I last saw them—I work at a great many places—this was six months before the fire MR CLARKSON Q Can you tell my friend the different articles in the rooms if he desires to know them A Yes THOMAS DAVEY I have been lately living with Mr Rotherham in Shoreditch—he is a linen-draper I lived with the prisoner Miers from the 26th of June to the 26th of July in the last year—it was at the house in High-street—I was engaged by a person named Midgley who I did not know before—before I went to Miers I had been at Crawford-street—Midgley engaged me to go there—I do not recollect the number of the house—I think I went there on the 23rd of June—I am not positive—it was three or four days before I went to High-street—I was engaged there for a permanency but the shop was never opened—I was there three days and slept there four nights—I had been there three times before I entered the service—I have followed the business of a linen-draper fifteen years—I consider the value of the prisoner s stock in trade as it stood at that time was from 200l to 1500l —it consisted principally of Irish linen shawls silks merinos stays and prints—they were filled shawls principally that meant with dark black grounds—I should think there were about forty pieces of Irish linen of various qualities from 8d a yard—some I believe were as High as 3s —2s a yard would be a fair liberal average for the whole—I should say there were from fifty to sixty filled shawls about twenty or thirty plain centres bordered and about as many woollen—there are various qualities of woollen—it is a common kind of shawl—the filled shawls would average from 15s to a 1l each—the average of the plain shawls and border-ed would be the same—the woollen ones from 7s 6d to 8s —if we were to say 15s each for the whole stock of shawls it would be a liberal allowance—I remained in Mier s service a month—during that period I think there were two or three deliveries of goods from the warehousemen—I think the largest parcel would be about 14l or 15l —they were hosiery haberdashery and ribbons—I remember some silks coming on sale or returned—that was the last parcel—I cannot say exactly what portion of those silk were retained—some of them were I believe—the things came principally from Coster and Co in Aldermanbury—some articles came from Brown s in Oxford-street—that was hosiery and shirts ready made shirts collars and shirt fronts—two or three deliveries came while I was there—when the hosiery came from Brown s in Oxford-street there were goods had in exchange—I can only speak to two parcels—there were two quilts or counterpanes had in exchange—I cannot say what was the value of the goods delivered by Brown—Miers had goods from him several times—some were kept and others returned—I remember meeting the prisoner on the Monday after the fire in Farringdon-street between eleven and twelve o clock in the forenoon—he told me he had had a fire—I asked him if it had done much damage—he said it had burnt every thing and had not left him so much as a coat to his back—I asked him How it originated—he said he could not tell he had no idea Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Where have you been living since you left the prisoner—in London A Yes—I was not examined Before the Magistrate—I was subpoenaed here—I was living in service—I did not get a character from the prisoner when I went away—I did not apply for one Q How came you to leave Mr Miers A I was never engaged by Miers himself—I was there a month serving in the shop—I do not know the reason why I went away—he told me after I had been with him about a fortnight he should keep me till the month was up—he gave me no reason for it—he made no charge against me at that time—he never made any charge against me—he had no charge to make—he laid a charge against me that was not right—he challenged me with robbing him—I left his service I thirteen or fourteen days after that—he made no charge after that—I know there were merinos in the shop—they are rather valuable articles—they were not in boxes—they were in wrappers—I had undone two—there were about four wrappers in all of merino—but six wrappers altogether—I cannot say what was the value of the wrappers I had not undone—they were common goods which I did not undo as they were marked outside and therefore I did not open them—the merinos were in a closet up stairs when I went—they were not there because there was no room in the shop—they could have been in the shop—I never saw but two cloaks—there were no places where they could be kept without my knowledge unless it was in the bed-room—I was only one month in his employ and was charged with robbing him—I met him in Farringdon-street when I spoke to him—he began the conversation—he passed me and turned back—I remained with him fourteen days after being charged with robbery—I am quite certain of that—I will swear I did not leave the day after the charge was made—I have sworn it—I will swear it was more than two days after the charge was made that I left—I have not made any offer of my evidence in this case Q How came they to know any thing about you A They traced me from a situation I was in in Regent-street about three years ago—I had not given information about having lived with the prisoner MR CLARKSON Q You staid about thirteen days with your maske after being charged with the robbery explain what the charge was A A female was sent in to buy goods with two half-crowns eight shillings and a sixpence—she purchased a print dress for 10s 6d and a pair of stockings for 2s 6d —I served her—she was sent with marked money and after she had made the purchase Mr Miers came in and took the cash-drawer out of the desk into a back place examined it afterwards called me into the parlour and asked if I had sold the goods—I told him I did—he said it was very strange there was 2s short—after some time he told me where the money was marked and on looking through the money I found the two shillings marked as he had said—it was shown to him and he denied two of the shillings being marked—I proved another to him as being marked and he said it was the shilling the lady had given him with the bill—he said he was satisfied that what he had charged me with was a mistake and asked me as a favour to remain with him all the month—I had not been originally engaged with him at all—I was engaged by Midgley in Crawford-street but that shop was not opened—I was led by Midgley to Mr Miers till the shop in Crawford-street could be opened—the prisoner did not make any charge against me before a Magistrate or to an officer—when I met him in Farringdon-street he conversed with me in a friendly spirit—he never repeated the charge of the marked money after the drawer had been examined and the money found—one of the marked shillings was afterwards found in the drawer and the other I believe he had in his pocket—it was produced by him himself—I staid thirteen days after that at his request—I made out my account at the time to leave and presented it to him and he requested me to stay—there was no other shopman employed at that time—Gattrell was in the shop all the time—he was the shop-boy—he did not serve in the shop—he served small customers occasionally—he was errand-boy GEORGE BANKS I am a linen-draper s assistant I went into Midgley s service the day of the decease of the late King and staid about three weeks—I left the day the King was buried—I do not recollect the exact day him late Majesty died—it was in June and I think it was the 15th—I was with Midgley in Crawford-street—the shop was never opened from his not being able to get stock to open it—there was stock in the shop that was there before I went there—at the end of the three weeks there were some wages due to me and Mr Miers paid me—I had what was due to me within 8s or 10s —during the time I was engaged by Midgley I went as different times to the house in High-street Q With the opportunities you had could you form a judgment of the value as to the stock in the shop A Yes—going at different times of course I could not examine it particularly—I have been a linen-draper fifteen or sixteen years—I should say from what I saw that the stock was worth 700l or 800l but certain description of goods were kept out of night and I was never behind the counter—the stock appeared small generally speaking—it was a general stock—I could not say any thing about he quality of it—I never saw any of it to handle it—there were linens shawls silks and other things—they were the most bulky part of the stock—I did not see many of them—not to any amount—I know nothing of the quality of the stock Cross-examined by MR JAMES Q When were you first at Mr Miers s house A I cannot say—I was there five or six times—the last time I was there was He day he settled with me the day the King was buried on a Saturday—that is generally a busy season of the year but in consequence of the death of the King it was flat—in the month of June in linen-drapers business there would be more sold than at any other season of the year and therefore a greater diminution of stock—stock is bought early in the spring for the summer trade and in autumn for the winter trade—I was not there in sutumn—how much might be diminished in June and replenished in autumn I cannot tell—I did not see any lace there—I saw the boxes—lace is generally kept in boxes not exposed to view—what quantity of lace there was I cannot say—we generally form a judgment in proportion—I mean if there was a quantity of merino there would be a proportionate quantity of lace—it depends on the trade—I cannot say what the proportions are—some persons sell a great deal of lace and others sell more of other goods—I cannot say what might be the value of his stock of lace—there might be 100l worth of merino and more of lace but I cannot say as I did not see it Q Do you not know that Mrs Midgley gave you an order on Mr Miers to pay you your wages A No I cannot say—I was referred to Mr Miers—Mr Midgley was in the country at the time and I believe wrote a note to Mr Miers to pay me—it was not communicated to me that Mr Midgley had given an order to Mr Mien to pay me—I understood from Mr Miers that he had received a letter from Midgley requesting him to pay me—he told me so—I gave a receipt for what he paid me—I was not examined before the Magistrate—I got my subpoena one morning about a booth ago MR CLARKSON Q I believe you were not found till after the prisoner was committed A No I was not at least during the examination—it was before the committal—it was the last day of the examination—I was not found till that day—I am in a shop No 68 Whitechapel-road now—were it another assistant there besides myself and four apprentices—the value of my master s stock I should judge is about 2000l and we have a stock of woollens worth 4000l or 5000l besides—I have made my estimate of the stock in High-street from the proportions which I consider one article bore to another from what I have seen in other shops regard being had to the situation of the shop—I do not speak definitely or with accuracy—I believe the prisoner dealt in ready-made stays and shoes I believe MR JAMES Q What would be the lowest value of the stock where you now are before you laid in a fresh stock for the winter A It might be reduced some 300l or 400l —we are always obliged to keep a certain quantity of stock—October and November are what are termed dead months generally—it depends on the season a good deal—our stock is not replenished till next autumn—we are constantly buying and selling WILLIAM CONST AN TINE I am landlord of the house in Crawford-street which was taken by Midgley on May 16th 1837 It was taken for haberdasher s and draper s—he afterwards told me that he was not of age and I refused to let him have the house unless he paid for it by the week—the rent was not regularly paid—I was obliged to put an execution in for eight weeks rent—he was to pay fifty-two guineas a year but in weekly payments that would be 1l 1s 10 1/2 d a week—it was eight time that—I saw Mr Miers there before I put the distress in—when I applied for the rent he was there—he wanted me to give Midgley a fortnight to remove his goods out of the premises and then he would give the hour up to me—there was a bedstead and a mattress there which Mr Miers said belonged to him—I do not know whether there was any stock—then was stock but after I put the execution in Mr Miers hoped I would not take the boxes which were in the back-room second floor on the bedstead as he said they were his property—I saw those boxes—I think there must have been about ten or a dozen at least—I should consides they were such as contain lace and ribbons in a haberdasher s shop—I seemed to acquiesce in his proposal of giving Midgley a fortnight till I got out of doors and having been served a dirty trick by another tenant and having received a letter I thought it best to put in an execution—it was in consequence of information which I received that I put in the distress—after that I was there with the broker and saw Mr Miers and he wanted me to take 3l at first then 4l and 5l to withdraw the execution—to take that in cash instead of the eight weeks rent—I said I did not want to put them to distress and if they would pay me 5l I would withdraw the distress and let them pay the rest when they could—Mr Miers said he would see and get the 5l and Midgley and he both went oat together is endeavour to raise the money but they came back and said they could not succeed—he said he hoped I would not enforce the distress-warrant and proposed to give me a cheque on Mrs Miers his wife for the 5l—I knew that she was his wife—I did not accept his proposal—I said that he had unmasked himself and I should let the broker proceed—I said nothing more but left the broker in to do his duty—they left the house and I got possession but not for some time—they gave me a deal of trouble—he gave the house up on the 15th of July—he left before that I believe—I had received no rent before I put the distress in—it must have been in July that I put in the distress Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Were you offered any fixtures in lieu of rent A No—I was offered them in lieu of a£20 hill which Midgley gave me but he took away some of my fixtures—it was a shop-door which he promised to replace but nearer didr—I was not examined at the police-office THOMAS WINK WORTH I am a carrier between London and Isleworth I know a linendraper s shop at Isleworth kept by a person named Mrs York—the name of A York was on the door—I have chiefly seen one female in that shop—I do not know her name—I knew Mr Miers s shop in High-street—I have taken parcels from his shop to the shop at Isleworth but seldom—I have nothing booked about it as I was always paid for my labour as I delivered my parcels—the first time I took any I think was in the summer-time and the last time as near as I can say about three or four months ago but I cannot say for I paid no attention to it at all—it was some time before Christimas now I call it to mind—it was most likely longer but I never paid any attention to it—it is unknown to me How many parcels I took from one place to the other as I never booked a parcel—it might be ten or a dozen or fifteen parcels—some of them were wrapped in paper and some in canvas—they were various sizes—some were less than that box and some might be five or six times larger—the male at Isleworth paid me—it was mostly a female about thirty years if age that I saw at Isleworth—I did not always go myself to the shop High-street for the parcels—I generally sent my lad for them—when I did go I saw one man in the shop and a boy and at one time a female or there might be two females—I still go backwards and forwards to Isleworth—the linendraper s shop there was kept open but a very little while after I ceased carrying the parcels Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Were you before the Magistrate A No CHARLES BISCHOFF I am a solicitor carrying on business in Copthall-court I am the proprietor of the house No 80 Surrey-place Old Kent-road—in November last I let that house to the prisoner—I do not believe he occupied it—a Mrs Clark occupied the house and her name was over the door at Christmas—I do not know Mrs York ELIZABETH PAUL In November last I lived at No 29 Surrey-place Old Kent-road—Mr Miers came to occupy the next house No 10 and the shop was opened as a linen draper s—before it was opened saw some furniture come—I think that was about the beginning of December but I cannot speak to dates—I saw a cart of household furniture and the shop goods together—they were goods that are sold in men drapers shops—I saw some boxes in which ribbons and Jaces are kept—I think it was in the early part of December that the shop was opened—on the morning of the day it was opened I observed a coach stop at the door and Mr Miers get out of it—he handed out a female and in me coach was a number of boxes and trunks which were handed out and carpet bag—I do not know who the female was—she went into the house with Mr Miers I believe—I cannot say How many boxes there were—there might be three or four or five I cannot say—I saw the prisoner the shop a few days after it was opened—I cannot say whether he was there every day—I saw him there as much as three times—it was in the evening that I saw him—the shop was closed in the early part of February—I cannot tell the day it was closed—I was from home that week with my daughter who was sick—I have a daughter who can speak to the fact—I observed the shop closed when I came back—I think it was on a Thursday that I returned and saw it closed—it did not open again that I recollect until very lately Quite at the end of February I think—there were then bills in the window stating that the stock was to be sold off on the Monday following—it was open on the 1st or 2nd of March and two or three days before that Quite at the latter end of February—on the day I saw the bills in the window stating that the stock was to be sold off I observed the shop partly open—the shutters were down—there seemed to be stock in the shop in a confused state—I saw carts and a coach arrive I think on the 2nd of March—that was not the day the stock was to be sold but before—there were five small carts and a coach—I saw them go away Full of linen drapery—it was the stock of the shop which was taken away —they drove up to the shop—I saw the linen drapery put in—I did not see Mr Miers there—I had frequently observed coaches coming before that—I cannot state whether any thing was taken away—yes once I saw a coach go away with trunks and a carpet bag similar to the trunks I saw arrive—that was some time before the 2nd of March—I saw the coach take away stock similar to that I had seen arrive in the coach with a female and Mr Miers—trunks and a carpet bag—I did not see Miers when the coach took away those goods—a respectably-dressed man was with the coach—he get in after the coach was loaded Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You were not before the Magistrate either I believe A No MARY PAUL I am the daughter of the last witness and live next door to the shop which was opened in Surrey-road I remember seeing the prisoner there—about ten o clock one day about the middle of December I saw Mr Miers arrive with a female—I do not know who the was—some boxes some trunks and a carpet bag were brought into the house—the shop opened the same morning about two hours after he had arrived—I saw him there several times after that—I have seen him in the middle of the day and several times in the evening—the shop closed on a Monday the 5th of February—it was not open at all that day—in the evening of that day I saw a cab at the door and there were boxes and parcels inside the cab—I did not observe any trunks that day—the week following a hackney coach was at the door and seemingly the same trunks and boxes and carpet bag went away—about the middle of February a van came to the house and took away some household goods—I did not perceive any thing else taken away—on the 2nd of March there were five carts came in the evening—they were loaded at the door of the house with the stock of the did which was taken away Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Were you before the Magistrate A No THOMAS BROOKS I am a linen-draper carrying on business in South wark On the 22nd or 23rd of February I heard of the sale of a linendraper s stock at No 30 Surrey-place Old Kent-road—in consequence of what I heard I went on the 23rd of February to Queen-street Cheapside and from there went with Mr Jervis to No 30 Surrey-place Old Kent road—I effected a purchase there of him of some linen-draper s stock—there were shop marks on those goods—I told Mr Toplis what those shop marks were and they corresponded with those which Mr Toplis had—I bought the stock in the lump and afterwards disposed of it—among the articles there were a great quantity of satin ribbons—Mr Jervis did not take down the quantities—it was taken by eye-sight—Mr Weston took down the particulars—Mr Jervis went away and left us there—I paid for the stock—I gave Mr Weston a cheque for£350 to give to Mr Jervis—I afterwards disposed of the stock to Messrs Warren—the stock of ribbons at the Surrey-road bore an extravagant proportion to the rest of the goods—about a fortnight ago I effected another purchase with Mr Jervis of some shawls—those shawls bore the same shop mark which the other stock had borne—that purchase was effected by my partner at Mr Jervis s office in Queen-street Cheapside—we gave 40l for shawels and other things Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Pray How many interviews had you altogether with Mr Jervis A Three I think—I required from him an explanation respecting the stock—the first time I saw Mr Jervis I asked him if it was a legitimate sale if I should be safe in making the purchase—he said yes he would explain to me exactly How the case stood—he told the they were goods belonging to Mr Miers there was no disguise about it whose house had been burnt down in High-street Marylebone that they were made over to his brother in part payment of a debt due to him by the prisoner—knowing Mr Jervis to be a respectable man I thought I should run no risk in making the purchase Q Did he tell you whether any of the goods to the amount of 40l had Hen taken out of pawn A I never heard it—the second purchase was made by my partner—I was not present—that was the shawls—all I can say is the shawls came to my shop and I gave a cheque for them—we live in the Borough—I have seen Mr Weston here to-day MR CLARKBOH Q Mr Jervis told you these were a transfer from the prisoner to his brother did he produce any document or merely give you his word for it A He gave me his word for it—I found the goods in Surrey-place—that was not the brother s house at least I was given to understand not JOHN BARTLETT I am an auctioneer In May or June last I received some articles for sale from Midgley—among those articles was a carpet—I told that and paid the money to Midgley—I had other articles for sale besides the carpet there was household furniture and other goods—this paper as a list of the goods that were for sale—I made it out this morning—I have the catalogue—a few days after the carpet was sold the prisoner Miers called on me—he did not have any conversation with me then—he called again and demanded the money for the carpet—I told him I had paid slidgiey for it and showed him Midgley s receipt—I had received part of the other goods from Mr Miers and part from Midgley—part were delivered by Mr Miers himself—I went to his house if High-street for some and part of them he delivered himself in a cab—some of the goods I am about to read came from No 65 Crawford-street— reading I—consisting of a roller-blind ladder mahogany wash-stand two coffee boilers two tin covers two wash-stands sundry forms three coffee-house settles rods and curtains three mahogany tap tables pictures wainscot chest of drawers two coffee-house tables two mahogany diningtables boxes and partitions a stump bedstead blankets feather bed and bolster counterpane pair of sheets a napkin six shawls three Pieces of Irish linen and two carpet bags—the principal part of those things were sold on the 1st of August 1837—they were sold by auction—when Miers called for the money for the carpet be said the carpet belonged to him and I should not have paid Midgley—I sold the goods on commission for Mr Green to whom the auction-room belonged—Mr Miers brought a letter from Midgley to say the goods belonged to him authorising Mr Green to pay him not only for the goods which came from High-street but also from Crawford-street—Mr Green received the money as clerk of the sale and having received the money from Mr Green in part of the sale I paid the prisoner part but I do not think he has received the balance—I paid it in consequence of a communication made to me from Midgley through the prisoner—while the goods were in the progress of being sold Mr Miers called at my house several times—he attended one sale and bought goods Q Now at any time when Mr Miers called on you did he make inquiry as to your being able to sell any thing else for him A Yes he asked me if I could sell any shop goods—I cannot state at what time that was—it was prior to August because the sale took place in August—the sale of the shop goods was in August—they were all in the same catalogue—was after that conversation that some of the shop goods I have read over was brought to me—about a month after the sale the prisoner called on me and stated that he was about to dispose of some soiled goods which he had at him house in High-street and I solicited the sale in consequence of his having stated that he was going to fit up a lodging-house—I solicited his favour saying I should like a good sale and he could buy goods of us in exchange—he did not carry that into execution with me—I saw after this at his shop in High-street—the shop windows had bills in them that time to dispose of the stock—I did not speak to him in the shop—I did not go in—I saw him in the shop putting some articles in the window and there were some bills stuck up about the stock selling off or to the effect—I really cannot say when that was—I cannot say How soon it was after the conversation about disposing of the soiled stock Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Is it not a very common thing in London for linen-drapers as well as others to put up bills about disposing of their stock at an enormous sacrifice to induce customers to come A I have heard of such things—it is very common—I believe the same shop may have bills of that kind up for years together—I was not before the Magistrate MR CLARKSON Q Was any thing known of you at all till within the last four or five days A Not till yesterday morning when I was sent for MR PHILLIPS Q Were these three pieces of Irish linen which you sold for Mr Miers sold at a loss A I do not know what he paid for then Q Did he not refuse in consequence of what they were sold for to he you have any more and take away the shawls and carpet bag A He took the carpet bag and five shawls away MR CLARKSON Q Was it after that he told you of his intention of selling off his stock A Yes FREDERICK FUTVOY I am the agent of the London Parcels Delivery Company—my place of business is in High-street Marylebone On Friday the 19th of January last I received a parcel from Mr Mien—we haves book in which we make our memoranda—it was directed to Mr Bustin No 8 Ingram-court Fenchurch-street—I remember hearing of the fire in High-street—this was the day before the fire—the size of the parcel to the best of my recollection was fifteen or sixteen inches square—I do not recollect the weight—after the parcel had been delivered to me the person I always understood to be Miers and believe to be the prisoner came back to open it to put something else in—I cannot say whether it was a letter—it was a piece of white paper—I could not see what was in the parcel—I was at the further end of the shop—I believe the parcel was forwarded to Ingram-court—it was sent from us—we received a parcel on the 29th directed to Mrs Clark 30 Surrey-place Old Kent-road—I do not know that it came from Miers Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Do you not put the weights down A No—we never at that time weighed them—there are four delivers daily—the person I always supposed to be Miers brought the parcel—I am not sure it was the prisoner—I was not before the Magistrate MR KELLY Q Have you looked at the prisoner A Yes—I believe it was him CHARLES DAVIS I live in Great Marylebone-street and am an agent to the London Parcels Delivery Company On the 26th of December I received a parcel addressed to Mrs Clark in the Old Kent-road—I have not the slightest recollection who brought it—I also received a parcel on the 1st of January—I have no knowledge whatever who brought it Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Is this your first appearance of this case A Yes GEORGE BONE I live in Crawford-street and am an agent to the Parcels Delivery Company I do not know the prisoner—I never saw him before that I know of—I do not know who the parcels came from which I received GEORGE GALLOWAY I live at No 7 Bowling-street I knew the lad who was employed by the prisoner—I was agent for the London Parcels Delivery Company—on the 28th of October and from that time to the 6th of January I received parcels which were brought by a lad in the prisoner s employ—I received nine parcels from the lad and one from the servant maid—they were directed to Mrs Miers 34 Whitechapel-road—the last parcel came on the 6th of January and went away on the 7 th—they were brown paper parcels I should judge from a foot to eighteen inches long nearly square—the first parcel I weighed was under 7lb and the other parcels averaged about that weight—they felt similar to shawls or linen—was something soft such as shawls or linen as far as I can describe ALEXANDER WATKINS I am a surgeon I knew the shop of Mr Miers in High-street Marylebone—about ten days or a fortnight before the fire I had occasion to make a purchase there—the principal part of the stock I observed was woollen goods shawls and comforters—the shop appeared to be very scantily supplied I should say from its first commencement—I had been in the habit of passing it eight or ten times a day and from the beginning it appeared to be scantily supplied—I passed it several times the very day the fire happened—I should say the stock had diminished at that time—it was very ill supplied during the last month—on the day of the fire I noticed a great many shawls hung up in the window—they were common woollen shawls and also some calico—that was the nature of the things I saw in passing the shop—the goods I have seen there for the last month I should say were very common goods Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Are you in the habit of prying into different shops to see if they increase or diminish A I am constantly in the habit of seeing goods in shops by going into them a person cannot help noticing—I am not constantly in the habit of looking into shops but that shop I noticed particularly—I was not before the Magistrate—there were principally woollen goods in the shop and some of those red comforters—I have seen some caps hanging up—I did not on any one day observe a diminution but in the course of the week I certainly did—I do not remember observing any lace hanging up—I cannot say whether there was any Irish linen or not—some of the shelves appeared to have parcels what was in them I cannot say—Irish linens are generally done up in large blue paper parcels—I did not observe any of those in the shop—if there was any my inspection was not minute enough to see them—if any were put up like dummies I did not see them—I could not see into the drawers to see if there was lace in them—it was in the winter season that I saw the shawls and comforters hanging up—many linen drapers have shawls and comforters hanging up in the winter but not the description of shawls I saw there they were so common such as you generally see servants wearing what I should call worsted—I did not notice any silk shawls—I will not swear there were not any—I can only swear to what I saw—there must have been a great many things I did not see—I could not see into the drawers—I cannot tell How many times I have been into the shop—the last time went in I purchased a red comforter for my errand-boy—that was not the only purchase I made there—I bought some sewing cotton for my with there one day as I was going out she requested me to buy it for her and bought a pair of gloves for myself—I found each article I wanted—I do not remember buying any thing else—I do not recollect How long it is since I made the first purchase—the cotton was the first thing I bought—I cannot tell How long ago that is—I bought the comforter about a fortnight before the fire—I was talking to both Mr and Mrs Miers at the time—I do not know which of the two served me—they were both serving in the shop—I do not know whether there was a boy serving—I am sure I do not remember whether any other person was in the shop or not—I cannot say on that particular day—I have seen a boy in the shop—I did not notice whether there was a boy there that day—one customer came into the shop while I was there—I do not know who served him but I think it was Mrs Miers—I was engaged in conversation with Mr Miers and did not observe what that customer was buying—I do not recollect having been to the shop oftener than I have stated—I cannot say whether there was any Irish linen there—I did not notice whether there was any or not—there might have been fifty pieces there without my observing them MR KELLY Q You speak of having been three times in the shop were your observations such as you made in passing as to what was in the window A Decidedly in the window—the goods as far as I noticed were generally of an inferior description AGNES CRAWFORD I live in Great Marylebone-street I remember the fire happening at Mr Miers s—the day before that I went to the shop for a pair of black worsted stockings—I was shown two pain—they did not suit me—they were very coarse—I asked for finer and said I would not mind giving 1s 8d —Mrs Miers served me and she said they had no others—I thought the shop was very thinly stocked very badly stocked indeed which has been my opinion in general lately—I noticed the shelves had a very scanty appearance indeed—one window of the shop looks into Bowling-street—I observed some stays there which I thought remarkably cheap—I observed nothing else at that time—I cannot say whether there were any shawls there—the stays attracted my attention more than any thing Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Perhaps you wanted stays A At that time I did and they attracted my attention—I cannot tell whether there were any shawls in the window—I did not notice any thing at all but the stays—there were other things in the window—I was never in the shop but three times—I did not observe the shelves till the last time—I went on the Friday night—I never noticed any Irish linen being there at all—it must have been about the middle of last summer I was first in the shop—I do not recollect seeing any linen at all—I went in for other things—and I made no particular observation then—I cannot undertake to swear that there was no linen there but I never noticed any—I saw some very common shawls some caps and a great number of common ribbons—not so good as I have on now—there was some common edging hanging up—I cannot undertake to say there was no lace—there were some small drawers in the shop but I did not notice them—I went there each of the three times to buy—the first time I went for some white satin ribbon but they had not any to suit me—they had some ribbons and offered to get me some—it has repeatedly happened that I could not be suited in shops—it a Common thing with respectable shopkeepers to offer to get a thing if they have not got it by them—stockings at 1s 8d are rather fine—in the summer I went to buy white cotton stockings—they were for the servant-girl—I did not wish to buy any thing for myself there—there were four or five pairs of stays in the window which I thought very cheap—I did not bargain for them—I had not the money with me to buy them MARIA EMMERSON I live with Mr Higgins who keeps a coffee-shop at No 13 John-street Oxford-street I know the prisoner at the bar—on Friday the 19th of January he came to the coffee-shop about nine o clock in the evening and brought two parcels—he asked me to take care of them and said he would call for them in a few days—they were two brown paper parcels—one was rather large and the other small—they were larger than that box—one was rather more than twice as large and the other was not so large but the smallest was larger than that box—he asked me to take care of them and said he would call for them in a few days—I afterwards made a mark on them when the Inspector came—the prisoner called again a few days after—two or three days after—it was after the Sunday about seven or eight o clock in the evening—I cannot say exactly the time—it was after dark—the gas was lighted—he asked me if I had taken care If the parcels—I told him yes—he said he could not take them then he would take them another time—that was all he said—I had never seen him before he came the first time with the parcels—the police-officers called on a Friday after and took the parcels away—it was a month from the day the prisoner brought them that they were taken away—it was on the Friday month after he brought them COURT Q Then he never called again A No—I never saw him since MR CLARXSON Q Are you acquainted with any person named Midgley A No I know nothing of him—there was no such person in the habit of frequenting master s house—I do not know the gentleman if I see him—no person of that name was in the habit of leaving or receiving parcels at our house—they were the two first that I had taken in— the parcels were here produced —that is one—the paper of the other has been turned think—yes that is the other parcel Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How do you know the parcels A Because I marked them—that parcel has been undone and the paper turned—I did not give any other parcels than these to Campbell or Dyer—this is the mark I made—I cannot write—they told me to put any thing I liked on it—they are the parcels both of them—I am quite sure these are the marks I made on them—I never saw the prisoner only once when he brought the parcels and once after—it was nine o clock in the evening when he brought them—he remained but a very few minutes then—he had his tea when he came the second time and went out again directly—ours is a shop of a great deal of business—we have a great many customers but I do not very often see different faces—we have regular customers—a great many—that is the gentleman that brought the parcels to me—when he came with the parcels he had a cloak on and when fee came after them he had a great coat on—I am quite sure of him—he never came after them again—if he had come and asked for them when I was out most likely it would be named to me when I came home—I was only in the habit of going out on Sunday—I am confident he came on the day I have said—it was on the Friday because I cleaned my coffee-room out and I always clean it out on Friday—I am quite sure it was the day I cleaned the coffee-room oat—I know it was that particular Friday because I looked back in the almanac to see—I counted the weeks—I can read—I recollect it as well without as with the almanac—I looked at the almanac because I would be confident—it was just a month to the time the parcels were taken away—I had seen the account of the fire in the papers—I have not had any communication with anybody connected with the fire-office since—I have not seen Mr Rickards or Campbell since I have been here—I had not seen any of the fire-office people between the time of the fire and my going before the Magistrate—they came after me—master sent for Inspector Campbell and he asked me about it when he took the parcels—I had no conversation with him between the time of his taking the parcels and my going before the Magistrate Q Did you give your evidence to Mr Rickards the attorney belonging to the fire-office A He was at Marylebone—I told him at Marylebone—I told the Magistrate there—I did not go to any house before that—my evidence has not been taken by anybody except the Magistrate—I have had no conversation with any of the fire-office people about it—I have come from John-street Oxford-street now—I do not know a person of the name of Midgley—I know pretty well all the names of my master s customers and there is never such a person comes there—we have about thirty regular customers and about thirty irregular ones—I do not exactly know all their names but I know them by sight—there may be persons known to my master and mistress and not to me MR CLARKSON Q When the prisoner called at your house after he left the parcels did he at that time tell you his house had been burnt down or that he had had a fire or any thing of the kind A No he did not WILLIAM WHITEWICK I am in partnership with Mr Brooks in the Borough About a fortnight back I made a purchase of some shawl of Mr Jervis the attorney for the prisoner—Mr Brooks gave a cheque for them to Mr Weston—Mr Weston came to our house and I went with him to Mr Jervis s office—I paid 40l for the shawls—they are the same shawls my partner afterwards saw in our establishment bearing shop marks Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you inquire of Mr Jervis or Mr Weston where the property came from A No Mr Jervis told me they were taken out of pawn—that was a voluntary communication from himself—I did not make any inquiry about them in consequence of Mr Jervis s respectability—I knew him before—I believed him to be respectable and still believe him to be so MARY WOOD I am the wife of Jonathan Wood and live at No 118 Great Titchfield-street—we keep a coffee-shop there I know the prisoner Mr Miers by his bringing parcels to my house—I did not know him before—I first saw him on Saturday the 20th of January—he came about five o clock that afternoon—he had given two parcels to my little girl who I had passed as I went down the shop—I did not see him give them to her—he asked for me—I was in the parlour and learnt that somebody wanted to speak to me—he asked my little girl or her mother—I went into the shop and there saw the prisoner and the two parcels—we had at that time a hill in our window for lodgings to let—the prisoner asked if I had a room to let him a—I told him I had not got a room I had part of a bed but I could not exactly say when it would be at liberty—I told him I could not have him an answer then on account of a gentleman s servant who was in new of a situation and I could not say exactly when it would be at party—he then said he would come in again and take tea and he went away she said he had no objection to part of a bed as I had not got a room—he had given the parcels to my little girl to take care of—he said so to me—my little girl had taken them into the parlour—I did not see the parcels before he left—yes I saw them in my little girl s hand as I was coming into the shop—I took care of those parcels till they were afterwards delivered to the policeman—I delivered them myself to Sergeant Dyer—they remained in my possession till I delivered them to him—he and Mr Campwell were both together— locking at two parcels produced —that is one of the first parcels—I do not know the other but it is one of the six—the prisoner did not come back to tea—I was not present about eleven o clock the same night when any other parcels were delivered—I was present on Monday the 22nd of January when two other parcels were delivered by the prisoner—before he came on the Monday two more parcels had been left but I did not see the prisoner till he came on the Monday—I saw him then—I was in the bar—he came into the shop and sat down on the first seat—he asked me again about the lodgings—this was about ten minutes to five o clock—he asked me what time it was and I told him—he asked if I could accommodate him with a lodging—I told him I could not give him any answer then—he said he did not want the lodging that night—that he was going to the play and should sleep at a friend s house in the City—he said he would look in again to-morrow—he brought two parcels with him that Monday afternoon—that wrapped in the newspaper is one of them—I cannot tell which is the other—those two were part of the six which were afterwards delivered to Dyer—when he brought these other parcels he did there were two more parcels

wanted lodgings—he went away saying he would come next day but he did not come and I did not see or hear of him again ill Saturday the 3rd of February which was nearly a fortnight after—I had not

Saturday the 3rd of February and took a cup of tea and sat an hour—he then asked for me—I went to him and he asked me about a lodging again—I told him he could have a lodging and he said he would take it from the following night Saturday —I said he could have it and he said he would come on the Sunday night—he then said he wanted to take the parcels away to the coach-office as he was going into the country on Monday—we told him we could not allow the to take the parcels away for as he had left them so long we had communicated it to the police and we thought it was not all right—my husband was

up to him—the prisoner then wanted to call a coach and take my husband—my husband said he would wait till he returned and brought his friend if he would fetch his friend there—he said he would return in half an hour and went away—he did not return and I never saw him again till I saw him at the police office Q During the whole of that time did the prisoner say any thing to you on to your husband about having had his house burnt or property destroyed A No he did not—he did not tell me who he was or where he lived not mention his name at all—when he went away he left all the parcels with

February—I do not know any thing of a person named Midgley—he had never been in the habit of using our house for receiving or leaving parcels that I know of—there was no one in particular for whom we

night are two of the six which were afterwards delivered to the police—I did not see him any more of the 3rd of February—he took something at our house that night but I am not certain what—after sitting there a great while nearly an hour I should think he said he had left some parcels some time ago and asked again if he could have a lodging—I told him I would speak to my wife—he did not say any thing then about having had a fire or his house being burnt down—nor did he when he came on the 20th of January tell me who he was or where he lived —I went and fetched my wife and we let him the lodging—he was to sleep with a young man and pay 3s a week—he agreed to that and he was to come on the Tuesday following—he then wanted to take the parcels away to take them to a coach-office and said he was going into the country—he said previous to that that he had been in the country—I told him in consequence of his leaving the parcels did not calling I had mentioned it to the police and could hot give up the parcels till I went to the police-office again—I had in consequence of suspicions I entertained informed the police of the circumstance—when I told him I had done so he wished me to call a coach and go with him to friend in Edgware-road and that would convince me the parcels were his—I refused to go and told him I must acquaint the police of it before I could give them up—he said he would go away and bring his friend and went away—in the meantime I went to the police-office—he never returned with his friend—he never gave any intimation when he called on the 3rd of February of having had a fire in his house or any thing having happened to him at all Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q You say he did not mention his name did you ask his name A No—I asked him no question to as certain who or what he was—not from beginning to end—my wife was present when the agreement was made for the lodging—Edgware road is I suppose about a mile from my house—it would take perhaps half an hour to go there and back in a coach—his proposal was that I should go with him to his friend and the parcels should remain at my house till we came back—that was what I understood Q Pray have you seen Mr Toplis A I have—he has been to my house—I have only seen him there once that was about a fortnight after the Monday on which the prisoner had called and I believe it was the day before Saturday the 3rd of February when the prisoner last called—Campbell and Dyer were with Mr Toplis when he came—my wife was there—I do not know that anybody else was there except the servant and she was not in the room—he was in the parlour looking the parcels over—he was there perhaps an hour or an hour and a half—he did not say a word about the fire—he did not tell me who he was—I do not recollect that he asked me any questions—not to my knowledge—he might ask me a question certainly but perhaps not relative to this—he did not ask me any thing about the fire—he did not say he came from the Fire-office—he was looking over the parcels and taking notes—he might be there two hours—he was occupied all that time in looking over the parcels and taking notes—I was bound over to appear here JAMES DYER police-sergeant E 2 In consequence of information which I received I went on Tuesday the 23rd of January to the coffee-shop of Wood s in Titchfield-street and remained in attendance there incase the prisoner made his appearance—I remained there till Wednesday evening and was then discharged by my superior officer from further attendance—I saw six parcels there which I have produced—I have produced the same six parcels that I saw there—I accompanied Inspector Campbell when he apprehended the prisoner—I went to Emmerson s and brought two parcels away from there—they are the two which I have produced Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Were you present at the time Mr Miers was apprehended A Yes—he was taken in New Bridge-store within three or four doors of Mr Toplis s house—I had been to Mr Toplis s house and was in a room there some portion of the time bat not at the time the prisoner came out of the house—I was not in the house when he was apprehended—I had been out of the house I should say an hour—I might have been in the house about twenty-five minutes or rather longer—Campbell was with me there—we were both waiting in a room there is consequence of a communication Q Did you know that Mr Miers was coming there to explain his accounts to Mr Toplis and were you not there to take him into custody when he came A We had no directions to do so—we were aware he was coming to attest his claim—we were not placed there on purpose to take him into custody when he did come—there was a communication from Mr Toplis to inspector Campbell that he was coming there to after his claim but it was on our own responsibility we took him into custody—Mr Toplis allowed us to wait in his house about twenty-five minutes Q How came you to go out again why not stop A I went out of my own will and afterwards took him in the street—I saw him come out of Mr Toplis s house—I touched him on the shoulder and told him I wanted to speak with him—I said no more at that time because Mr Campbell was present and entered into conversation with him—Mr Campbell stepped up to him immediately and said Mr Miers I wish to speak to you concerning some parcels left at a coffee-shop in Great Titchfield-street —the prisoner said What parcels —Mr Campbell said Yes don t mean to say you did not leave them —the prisoner said Yes there were some parcels left —Mr Campbell said Yes and by you and he said yes but they were not his property they were a friend s of his who had directed him to leave them there—Mr Campbell then inquired to know whether they had been called for previously by Mr Midgley—he had named Midgley as the friend—before that Campbell had cautioned him as to answering questions—Mr Campbell was dressed in a green coat over his uniform and I was in plain clothes—I had a drab great coat on—neither of us had the appearance of officers but Mr Campbell represented himself as an inspector after he spoke to him relative to the inquiry—it was not after he said it was not his property but the property of a friend—I will swear it was not after that—he said You don t know me I am an inspector of police and if you are not satisfied I will show you my uniform —those were his words Q At what part of the conversation will you venture to swear that took place A Directly after Mr Campbell had represented that he wished to speak to him concerning the parcels left at Great Titchfield-street—not before he had made an answer to it—he had made his answer—he said There were parcels left —Mr Campbell said Yes and by you —he said Yes and then Mr Campbell said he was an inspector of Police and he must consider himself in our custody—the conversation occurred after he was taken into custody—I believe there is no mistake about that—I did not tell him he was in our custody when I first tapped him on the shoulder—my superior officer being present I left it to him—we did not want to make him believe we were private persons—I was acting under the directions of my superior officer—after Mr Campbell told him he was an Inspector he represented then that they were not his parcels but the property of one Midgley and that it was by his desire he left them—and he said where parcels had been left previously —I have no recollection of any other conversation taking place—I took him to the station-house—I and Mr Campbell went with him—that is all I recollect passing SAMPSON DARKIM CAMPBELL I am an inspector of Police In consequence of information I received I went to Wood s Coffee-shop in Titchfield-street—I there saw the six parcels—these are them now on the table—I examined their contents on the 24th of January—they have since been seen by Mr Bailey of St Paul s-churchyard—I also got two parcels from Emmerson at Higgins s coffee-shop—these are the two—they are Not 1 and 2£—I have a list of the articles in the parcels It was here admitted by the prisoner s counsel that the aggregate value of the whole parcels was 63l —The parcels being inspected No 1 from Wood s was stated to contain shawls silk handkerchiefs and other articles of trade valued at 11l 18s 3d —No 2 ribbons &c valued at 8l 0s 5 1/2 d —No 3 child-bed-linen coral and bells valued at 3l 16s —No 4 shawls pieces of merino and cambric valued at 6l 6s 11 1/2 d —No 5 twenty-nine squares of fine diaper napkins marked M and numbered valued at 2l 18s —No 6 stockings edgings and other things valued at 5l 14s 8d —Parcel No 1 E at Higgins s sheeting gloves &c valued at 11l 0s 4 1/2 d and No 2 E caps laces veils and shawls valued at 13l 5s 1d SAMPSON DARKIN CAMPBELL continued In parcel No 3 there is a silver coral and bells also a bible and prayer-book which are new and very handsomely bound—there is no name in them—this is the coral Q When did you first obtain information about any of these parcels A On the night of Monday the 22nd of January about half-past eleven o clock—that relates to the first six—I had not heard of the fire at that time—I read an account of the fire in the newspaper while I was waiting for the person I supposed would call for the parcels at the coffee-shop—I think that was on the Tuesday the following day—in consequence of suspicions we had of the person who had left the parcels I and Dyer were on the look-out for him several days—we were there till about two o clock on the Wednesday and then as nobody came were determined to open them Q I want to know whether you merely went and apprehended the prisoner on the 12th on information you then received or whether you were on your own account on the look-out for him for several days before A Yes—we were on the look-out for him from the 22nd of January when we learnt that the parcels were left until the 12th of February—I was Dyer s superior officer—he acted under my authority—I did not apprehend the prisoner from any instructions from the Insurance Company—having made a report to the Commissioners of Police I acted under their orders—when I afterwards learnt that the prisoner was to be at Mr Toplis on the 12th of February I went there for the purpose of apprehends him and did apprehend him in New Bridge-street within a door or two of Mr Toplis s house about the second door after he left Mr Toplis—I said Mr Miers I wish to ask you some questions concerning some parcels left in Great Titchfield-street —he said What parcels —I said Some parcels which were left at a coffee-shop there I believe by you —he did not make any answer to that—I waited a moment or two for his answer and finding there was a hesitation I said You don t mean to say you did not leave them —he said There were some left —I said Yes and by you —he said Yes I did leave some but they are not my property they are the property of a friend —I said it was very extraordinary they should be left there under the circumstances they were and said You don t know me I suppose —I am an inspector of Police —he looked rather sharply round and I said If you have any doubt I will show you my uniform —I had a great coat buttoned and proceeded to unbutton it—he said Oh I will take your word —I said You must consider yourself in my custody —he said Oh indeed —Mr Campion a gentleman who had been with him at Mr Toplis s was with him then and some conversation took place between the prisoner and Mr Campion relative to letting a friend of his named Jervis know—he gave Mr Campion his direction and Mr Campion left—we then crossed over to the other side—I said it was a very unpleasant business I trusted he would be able to explain it—he said the things were left by him by the direction of a person named Midgley who had directed him to the coffee-shop having had things left there before—I asked him if he knew where Midgley was—he said no he did not know he believed he was in confinement somewhere but he did not know where—I said Don t you know be is in Whitecross-street prison —he said Very likely he is I don t know that he is but I hoped that be had got out before now —I said Do you know whether any application has been made on the part of Midgley for the parcels since they were left —he said Not that I know of—I am not aware —I then asked him if he knew whether the parcels had been fetched away—he said If they had been taken away you would not have come after me Q Did you say any thing to him in this part of the conversation about not answering any thing unless he thought proper A I think it was after saying it was an unpleasant business I said Mind I do not wish to elicit any thing from you likely to injure you I will ask a question or two do not answer if you think it likely to injure you —I then asked him if he had made any application himself about the things—he said no he had not—I asked him Have you never been then to the coffee-shop —I asked him if he knew of any application being made for them—he said none that he knew of—I asked him if he had been himself to the coffee-shop since the night he left them—he said no he had never troubled him self about them since he left them there—I had no further conversation with him relative to the business—we went to the station Q Do you remember either then or at any time asking him any thing about a servant A Certainly I do—there is one part I have omitted—in going along he turned shortly round and said Do you know a person named Sarah Davis —I said No I do not —he said Are you sure of that —I said I assure you I do not perhaps you will have no objection to tell me your motive for asking the question—he said Oh no never mind —I asked him whether the servant who lived with him at the time of he fire was still in his service—he said Yes —I said Is she at Fen-church-street —he said Yes she is there with my wife —I meant at Ingram-court—I expressed my regret at apprehending him at that time of night—he said Oh you could have had me at any time if you had chosen —said That is not so you have not been home to your lodging in In-gram-court since Saturday week —he made no answer to that—I believe that was the conclusion of the conversation—we bad then got to the station-house—he said nothing that night as to whether he should say any thing more to me or not Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Pray at what part of the conversation was it you gave him the caution not to tell you any thing unless he Hewed A I think it followed my saying it was an unpleasant business and I trusted he would be able to explain it—it was not after I had asked him about Midgley that I swear—I told him I was an inspector after my asking him whether he had not left the parcels—it was after he told me they were not his property but the property of a friend—it was then I told him who I was—after I told him who I was there was no conversation between him and me until we crossed over to the other side after Mr Campion had parted from him—I would not venture to swear that be called Mr Jervis his friend or whether he merely gave Mr Campion the direction of Mr Jervis—I will not swear that he said his friend—he did not mention He word attorney at all Q Did he not seem very much surprised after having a conversation with you in plain clothes to find you were an officer and took him into custody A He certainly was surprised—he said Oh indeed —he did not say it was a trap laid on the part of the office Q From whom did you get the information that he was coming to Mr Toplis A I received the information from Mr Toplis in answer to an Application made by me—I was in one of his rooms for half an hour—Sarah Davis was examined as a witness before the Magistrate and she is here—Mr Rickards attended before the Magistrate on the morning the first investigation took place but after it had been gone into to some extent—Mr Rickards wished it put off until one o clock but the Magistrate would not consent—I was at the police-office when Mr Rickards was there Q Did Mr Rickards say to the Magistrate that the Fire-office did not think they could press the detention of Mr Miers as he had refused to sign the draft claim which had been first furnished A He did not give Office as a reason—I understood the reason given by him was that the Office was not prepared to prosecute in the present situation or state of the case Q Have a care I have a person here who heard it was it not that the Fire-office did not think they could press his detention as the draft claim was not signed and the fraud was not completed A I did not hear that but I heard Mr Rickards say when he first came into the office that the Office were not prepared to prosecute in the present state of things—he did not say they were not prepared to press for his detention—I did not hear that—four or five witnesses had been examined at that time—I had been I examined Dyer had not—the Woods had—I do not think Mr Campion was examined till the second examination—I did not hear Mr Rickards say that they did not think they could press for the prisoner s detention MR KELLY Q How many persons were before the Magistrate altogether when Mr Rickards made the observation you have stated A I think not above four were examined on the first day—that was the morning of the 13th of February the day after the interview at Mr Toplips s—I do not mean to say that T have given the precise words of my conversation with the prisoner but I am certain they were to that effect—I made a memorandum of the heads of it SARAH DAVIS I am now living with Mrs Sands in Oxford-street was in the service of the prisoner for six months—I left in November—he afterward refused to give me a character for the breakages I had made and the state he said I left the house in—one Saturday night while I was in his service I remember his saying something—he did not say it to me but in my hearing as I was passing with the supper things master and mistress were sitting together at supper—he was complaining to mistress of the badness of trade and wished there was a train in the house—I think that was about two months before I left the service—I heard him complain once or twice of the badness of his business and his sister in particular used to tell me How bad business was Q While you were in the service do you remember parcels of goods being sent any where A Yes they were always directed to Miss York at Isleworth—I have seen Mrs York in High-street—they are the mother and sister of Mrs Miers Cross-examined by MR JAMES Q You live now with Mrs Sands A Yes—I have been there seven weeks on Thursday—Mr Miers refused to give me a character on account of the breakages and the state I left the house in—that was all he said—I told him mistress had promised me a character the last night I was with her and I should send to him for one—that was every thing that was said—that was when I asked for a character—I had never been charged with any dishonesty while I was there—not about a pair of stockings—there was a mistake about that—they were given to me to mend and mistress went into a passion one Sunday because I had not taken them up—they were legs of stockings to join to the feet—because I had not taken them up in time she said I wished to keep then—mistress made the mistake—I did not put them on nor wear them—they were found in the kitchen drawer—that was not mentioned at all when I asked about the character—there was no mistake about any gown sleeves—nothing occurred about any gown sleeves while I was there—I lived with Mr Reeves of North-street before I went to Mr Miers—Mrs Sands my present employer took me without a character but she went to my house and to persons who have known me from a child Q As near as you can recollect How long after you had been in Mr Miers s service was it that you heard him say what you have stated —A About four months—I went in May and it was in September I think—he was complaining to his wife of the badness of trade—they were in the parlour behind the shop—I was passing out with the supper things—I was on the steps of the door at the time I heard it—there were two steps inside the door and I was on the inner step within the door—he said It is a very bad night there is nothing done at all —he complained of the badness of trade in his business—he meant at the house in High-street—he said trade had been very bad that night—it was Saturday night which was a time there was generally more trade—he did not say that but it was always prepared for as such—the room was not so large as this enclosure the Counsels table Q Are you quite certain having heard him mention the word trade once—he did not say he wished there was a trade in the house A I fully understood him a train in the house—to the fullest of my understanding it was train —I cannot swear that I might not have been mistaken in the letter—the observation occurred to my mind immediately I heard the house was burnt down—I had not mentioned it to any one before but then I did—I first mentioned it the very morning after the fire—I had not mentioned it to anybody before to the best of my recollection—I was at home then in Hereford-street—I had not mentioned it to any but my own family up to the time of the fire—I will not be sure but I think I repeated it at a baker s shop at the corner of our street on the Sunday after the fire—I do not think I repeated it to anybody before the fire—I am thinking now—I cannot recollect that I did—I did not mention it to any one connected with this prosecution that I know of Q How were you found out as having heard this A Mr Campbell was told it from another person Mr Kinghorn where I have lived since my father and mother have been dead—my mother has been dead nearly five years and I have lived there when I have been out of services—I think I mentioned it to the person I call my mother Mrs Kinghorn before that time—I was talking to her of the fire—it came fresh to me when I heard of the fire—I have said it came to my mind on hearing of the fire but I have thought on it now and I think I mentioned it before the fire occurred—Mr Campbell came to me on the Friday as I had been to my situation on the Thursday MR KELLY Q You have been asked whether yon were ever charged with dishonesty was there ever any ground for charging you with dishonesty at any time A No not at any time if there had there would have been advantage taken of it—I am in highly respectable service now with the sister of Mr Robins the auctioneer Q Was the observation you heard accompanied by any expression which impressed it on your recollection A Yes it was a seeming wish that they had not been in the house or that they could do away with it—I was coming in and out and was going out at the door and did not get the whole sentence together but I heard him say he had had a very bad night and he d—d the house and wished there was a train there WILLIAM HOPKINS HOLYLAND I am in the house of Pawson and Co warehousemen and wholesale dealers They supplied goods to some extent to Mr Miers in Oxford-street—it was done under a guarantee—the goods were all paid for on the 4th of March 1837 and the guarantee was withdrawn on the 7th—they did not supply any goods after that—they were never asked JAMES BAILEY I am one of the firm of Bailey and Milner in St Paul s-churchyard—we are linen-drapers and haberdashers I have examined the contents of the six parcels which are here—they are such as would belong to a retail linen-draper or haberdasher—I find marks on them with respect to the cost price—the prisoner s marks have been furnished to me—I find by these marks that the cost price is 63l —that excepts the Bible and Prayer Book—I have put the coral at 11l —it is included in the 63l —the part valued by me would not exceed 5l —I value that by my own judgment—the rest is valued by the marks—they are not articles of a superior description such as would belong to a linen-draper in a large way—they we very much out of condition—some of them are very much soiled and damaged—I should say they appear to be like the remains of a stock— the original cost of them might be 63l but not in their present state or at the present market price—they are soiled and very much reduced in value—there are remnants of various articles Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How much should you take of the value of the 63l A Fifty per cent —some of them are not remnants—some of them are very good—I would take off fifty per cent and then I would not have them ROBERT STOREY I belong to the fire brigade I was at the fire on the night of the 20th of January—when I arrived the house was all on fire from top to bottom—I could not get in—nothing at all could be saved—I was employed to examine the ruins—I found the remnants of a watch—it looked like a silver watch to me and a chain and seals—there is a little lion on the seal and a key—it was damaged by the fire—it was not melted only burnt—I gave it to Mr Toplis—I did not find any gold watch—I have been used for twenty-two years to inspect the ruins of houses and property burnt—an article like a gold watch would always be capable of being seen after a fire and being identified—there would be the remains of it to see what it was—I did not find the remains of any silver spoons or forks—there was a half-crown a shilling and some coppers but no remains of any plate whatever—we should have found the remains of silver spoons if they had been there—we found some remains of linen and linen-draper s goods but no great deal—if there had been any considerable quantity of woollens or linen some remnants of them would be found—we did find the remnants of some but very few—we found the remnants of flannels and linen sheetings—we found the remnants of some linen and sheeting in pieces but not many—there might be three or four bushel baskets full altogether—that was all we found—I mean that was the quantity found of what would have been in pieces which we got out of the ruins—Staples went over the premises with me Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Was the fire in progress when you were called in A I was called about twenty-five minutes before one o clock—the fire was in full play when I arrived with the engine—I suppose we were at work at it above half an hour before we stopped the progress of the fire—the house was totally burnt—we saved the next house—it was a fierce fire—it was all in a body of fire together—there was a barricade of palings put round the house to secure the ruins two or three days after the fire—I remained on the ruins till the palings were put up—we all staid there night and day—I have put down in my book what firemen were there—Staples is here but none of the rest—there were seven altogether five in the day-time and two in the night Q Pray would not you expect in a fire of that kind so fierce as you have described that every thing would be reduced to ashes A Not plate nor copper—I was never examined here before—we found a few remnants of woollen things—there would be some of the fragments left if there had been things there—the fire would not reduce every thing to ashes—large rolls of flannel would not be reduced to ashes—Irish linen if it was in a roll would not be burnt to ashes—there would be the remains of it and there is some on the rollers now—I should expect to find some remains of twenty or thirty yards of calico—I should not expect to find much remains if it was loose—I should not expect to find any remains if it was loose—I should not expect to find any great deal of loose calico—if on rollers we should find some—I cannot say whether we should find enough if loose to show us the pattern—if loose I cannot say whether I should expect to find any remains—if there was a great fire I should not find much but some—I found a few steel busks which go in stays and a few bits of whalebone—I did not give Mr Toplis all I found—they are under lock and key Q If there was any glass would it not be entirely fused by the heat of the fire A It would be a very heavy fire indeed to make glass so that we should not detect it through a sieve—there was not fire enough to run glass so that we could not find it in running it through a sieve—it was not enough to melt glass because it was so soon out—the house was on fire but there was not heat enough to melt glass or plate—one house was burned and another damaged GEORGE RICHARD STAPLES I belong to the fire brigade I was employed with Storey in sifting the ruins of the fire—the first day I was there we turned it over with a shovel before we used the sieve—we found the apparent remains of the stock of a shop—I should think the day I was there we did not find more than a bushel basket of remains—I have been engaged with fires since 1825—we generally find the greater part of such goods as are packed close like Irish linen—after we had gone over the ruins I began sifting and found a seal and a lion I think on the ring with the seal and a shilling was found and part of a silver pencil-case—we found the half-crowns the first day along with the silver watch—we did not find any gold watch—these articles are what I found—here is a spoon—I cannot say whether it is silver—I did not examine it—I do not think it is silver Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Is it because you did not examine it that you do not think it is silver A I did not think it was from the first appearance—I had no charge of the property—I dare say there were four firemen on the ruins sifting—there were not five the day—I was there—I cannot say How many days the sifting continued—I was only there one day Tuesday the 13th of February—the sifting began a few days before I was there—there were three firemen besides myself EDWARD TURNER I am a police-sergeant I was on duty in the Fulham-road about three o clock on Sunday morning the 4th of February—I was in the road leading from Fulham to Hammersmith and met the prisoner with a bundle Tinder his arm—he was going in the direction of Hammersmith walking and alone—in consequence of something which occurred to me at the time I spoke to him and asked what he had under his arm in the bundle—he stated that he had a coat and trowsers—I asked him if they were his own—he said Yes —I asked where he was going—he said he was going to Hammersmith to some cousins and was coming from Mr Carter s a linen draper at Wandsworth that he lived there—I told him he most go with me to Wands worth—I took him back and on the road I thought I heard money rattling in his pocket—I told him to take his hand out of his pocket till we got to the station-house and when we got there I searched his pocket and found a£10 and a£5 Bank of England note eighteen sovereigns seven half sovereigns and 6s in silver—they were loose in his pocket not in any thing—when I first heard them they appeared to be running out of a cigar-box which he had in his pocket—I heard them running out—there was a cigar-box in his pocket a memorandum-book and some other articles of which my inspector Mr Busain who was present took some notes—he was asked his name and also what he was—he asked me to go with him to the Edgeware-road to some friend of his named Genna—the inspector would not allow me to do that but said he would allow him to forward a letter—he then mentioned the name of another friend Mr Thomas Miers of Whitechapel-road and be was allowed to write a letter by allowing the inspector to look at it before I had it and that letter I took—he signed his name to the letter as John Martin— he did not say where he lived—no address was given more than what I saw in the account-book which was in his pocket —it was the inspector sent me to Mr Miers in Whitechapel-road—the inspector took a copy of the letter at the station—I do not remember that the prisoner said any thing further it that time—I got to Whitechapel-road between nine and half-post ten o clock in the rooming as near as I can tell—Mr Thomas Miers was out but he returned in half an hour—I saw him before eleven o clock—I delivered him the letter and he followed me to Wands worth and saw the prisoner and identified him as being his brother—what passed afterwards was with the inspector—I did not know the prisoner s name was Miers before his brother came Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You first learnt that by the letter which he gave you to his brother A I first learnt his name to he Miers by his brother—I found the brother in consequence of the letter and through him found out the prisoner s name—he came to the station-house to his brother—there was a gentleman along with him and to the best of my belief that is the gentleman the prisoner s attorney Q Were you present at any conversation that took place at the time between the prisoner his brother and this gentleman A Nothing particular—it was inside the office and I was standing outside—whatever conversation took place my inspector will state—there was some conversation took place and it was stated to the inspector by this gentleman or the brother that the prisoner had left his home in consequence of a quarrel with his wife that night MR KELLY Q Did this take place in the course of the conversation which arose when the prisoner s brother went to the station-house at Wandsworth A Yes—the inspector attended to it more than I did JOHN BUSAIN I am inspector of the police which in February last was stationed at Wandsworth—I remember the Sunday morning the 4th of February police-sergeant Turner coming to the station-house with the prisoner about four o clock—he was presented to me by the sergeant for having in his possession a bundle of clothes which he refused to give a satisfactory account of—in consequence of that statement I felt it my duty to put some questions to the prisoner—I asked him first How he became possessed of the clothes—he said they were his own—I asked him what was his for being out at so late an hour—the sergeant had given an account of the conversation he had with him—he said he was going to see I believe a sister or friend a relation at Hammersmith—I then asked him his name—he told me hit name was John Martin—I asked him where he lived he said with Mr Genna 36 Edgeware-road—I was surprised that the sergeant had brought him from the Middlesex side to me as he belonged to Chelsea station and asked him why he brought him to me—he said because he had referred to a linen-draper who knew him at Wandsworth the Bee-hive who he had formerly lived with a Mr Carter and therefore he thought it necessary to bring him over to me that if the reference was correct he might go about his business—I told the prisoner I was not satisfied with the account and his being out at that hour and wished to know what other property ha had about him—he put his hand into his coat pocket and took out a lot of gold sovereigns and half sovereigns—it was a kind of frock coat he had on—the packets were at the side not in the skirt—he produced a cigar-case with the end of it knocked out and in that was a£10 note and a£5 note—the gold was loose in his pocket—there were eighteen sovereigns and seven half-soverereigns—there was a memorandum book—I have not got it here it is given up to his brother—on examining the memorandum book I saw the name of Mr Miers—it appeared a journal such as commercial travelers would have—when I saw the name of Miers I asked him who this Mr Miers was—he said it was a person for whom he was or had been in the habit of doing business—he did not tell me it was his brother—I told him I was not satisfied on the subject and wished to know where this Mr Miers lived it appearing to be by the journal an account current entering into the present year—he told me Mr Miers lived at 34 Whitechapel—he requested pen ink and paper of me that he might write as I said I should said to Mr Miers—I furnished him with pen ink and paper and took a copy of the letter which he wrote—I saw him write it—he did not at that time tell me that Mr Miers was his brother—I had no idea that he was his brother till came to the station-house—he signed the name of John Martin—after the letter was written I directed the police-sergeant to take it to Mr Miers and between eleven and twelve o clock that morning Mr Miers came to the station-house with that gentleman—the gentleman did not tell me he was an attorney—Mr Miers said the prisoner was his brother and claimed the money as his property and the book also Q Up to the time Mr Miers came and said he was his brother and claimed the money and book had you any reason to believe the prisoner was related to him or that he was his brother A Not in the least—the attorney did not explain the reason why he gave the name of Martin—Mr Miers explained it saying he was his brother and was very much obliged to the police for detaining him because he had Left home in consequence of family quarrel and he was afraid he would have committed suicide—Mr lervis the attorney was present at that statement—he did not contradict it or confirm it—he passed no remark—the prisoner was exceedingly agitated during the time—neither the prisoner his brother or the attorney said say thing about his having had a fire at his house or any thing of the kind This closed the case for the Prosecution MR PHILLIPS addressed the Jury on the prisoner s behalf and the following witnesses ware called for the Defence WILLIAM MIDGLEY —I commenced living as shopman with the prisoner Mr Miers at the latter send of September or beginning of October 1835 the carried on business at that time at 184 Oxford-street—I continued with him till he removed into High-street and continued in High-street till the 16th of May last—he finished removing from—Oxford-street to high-street on the 25th of March 1837—I assisted him to remove the goods Q In your estimation what was the value of the stock he removed from Oxford-street to High-street A I should think it was upwards of from 800l to 3000l —I cannot say exactly and it continued at about the same amount till I left—we kept buying goods as we sold them—I expressed the prisoner my intention of setting up business myself as a linen-paper in Crawford-street and I bought some things of him in King-street Legent-street—they were coffee-house fixtures and furniture—he wished to let the house in King-street and wished to get rid of it as it did not exactly answer his purpose—I bought the furniture to put into my house in Crawford-street—I was to pay 60l for them—I married Miss Maria York a sister of Mr Miers s wife—he did not know we were married at the time I bought the fixtures of him—she was managing the coffee-shop at the time I married her—I had an idea of having a bill of exchange got before I bought the fixtures from an uncle of mine of the name of Bowler—I afterwards obtained it—Mr Miers furnished me with goods to the amount of between 50l and 60l for the purpose of stocking my shop in Crawford-street and while the shop was being fitted up he lent me between 20l and 30l making altogether between 80l and 90l besides the 60l worth of furniture—when I obtained my uncle s acceptance I took the bill to Mr Miers as I had promised him—I gave it to him according to previous promise—it was for 410l —it was drawn by me and accepted by my uncle—I delivered it to Mr Miers for the payment of the goods I had the money lent and the coffee-house fixtures—it was as security—he was to pay me over the difference when the bill was paid—it had a month to run—if it was paid at the end of the month he was to give me the difference Q Having possession of that bill did you make any purchases of Walters and Co wholesale warehousemen in Wood-street Cheapside A Yes to the amount of between 140l or 150l and I bought at different houses other goods to the amount of about 50l for the purpose of stocking my shop in Crawford-street to open it—I expended about 30l in fitting up the shop—the bill became due before I could get the shop ready to open or rather the same day that I was to open the 27th of June—it was not paid—the money I expected to receive on that bill was the only means I had of carrying on the business and opening the shop or paying for the goods I had purchased of tradesmen or of Miers—when the bill became due Miers came to me and asked what he was to do—I advised him to go to the acceptor Bowler and I went with him—he lived at No 38 Pickering-place Bayswater—I was not alarmed as I expected he had not the money then but would pay it in a few days—he did not pay it when we went to him—he offered to give Miers 200l and his acceptance for 210l Payable at another month or two months whichever they liked to agree to—Miers would not accept that and told him he should bring an action against him for the full amount unless it was paid—Miers paid it after that to his brother Thomas Miers COURT Q What endorsed it over to him A Yes after it was over due MR PAYNE Q Did Miers eventually recover the bill or not A No it remains unpaid still—an action was brought on it and the verdict was for the defendant—the action was brought by Thomas Miers but the arrangement was made between Miers and myself—the bill was taken to Jennings and Turner Whitechapel-road and they arrested him for it—the prisoner and I arranged that I was to give him back all the goods I had of him—then there was an agreement drawn up by Mr Turner WILLIAM HENRY TURNER I am a partner in the firm of Jennings and Turner solicitors Whitechapel-road—I have not any agreement or any document here between Mr Miers and Mr Midgley—I drew up a paper which was taken away immediately after I had drawn it either by Midgley or by Robert Miers—I think they were both together—it was on the 9th of August—I have never seen that draft since but I saw the fair copy of it after it had been signed by Midgley—I taw it in the possession of the prisoner COURT to WILLIAM MIDGLEY Q Have you got that A No I have not—the only time I saw it was when it was signed—I believe Mr Genna Witnessed it—the prisoner got possession of it and it remained in his possession up to the time of the fire for aught I know WILLIAM HENRY TURNER continued I recollect what the purport of the agreement was perfectly—the date of it must have been a few days after the 9th of August—it was very shortly after I had drawn it—I have not got a copy of it—I drew it roughly on a memorandum while the parties were in my office—and that rough draft which I so drew I handed over to one of them and they took it away—I afterwards saw a fair copy which had been signed and read it—there was a blank left in it for some words—I am able to tell the substance of the contents of that fair copy MR KELLY Q Before you do so I will ask you a question or two I understand you the agreement that was signed between these parties was prepared about the 9th of August A That was when the rough draft was prepared—that rough draft was not signed—it was delivered to me or other of them and I never saw it again—it was not signed in my presence—it was about a week or ten days after I should think that I saw the fair copy—that was in the possession of Robert Miers—it remained in his possession after I had seen it—that fair copy was signed by Midgley and Robert Miers—I think it was signed by both—it certainly was signed by Midgley and it was witnessed—I do not remember the same of the person who witnessed it—it was certainly signed by Midgley and I believe by both Q Now I wish you to be accurate about it have you a sufficient recollection of the contents of that instrument which was signed and which you call a fair copy so as to state its contents A I can state its general contents I think accurately—its general purport—I have no doubt I can late that accurately—I think I can state substantially the whole effect of it MR PAYNE Q Then now state the substance of the agreement A The substance of the agreement was to this effect That Thomas Miers was to be plaintiff in an action on a bill of exchange—I am not sure whether it was before the action was brought—I can tell by reference to my book—I have got the proceedings of the action— referring to a memorandum —it was after the action had been commenced just after the writ was issued—the substance of the agreement was to this effect that certain goods belonging to Midgley were to be deposited with Robert Miers which goods I believe were specified in an inventory by way of schedule and Robert Miers was to have the power of disposing of those goods if so disposed to convert them into cash and the proceeds were to form an indemnity against the costs of the action brought by Thomas Miers against Bowler the defendant in the action—I think the goods were valued in the agreement at 147l —it was the ascertained value WILLIAM MIDGLEY re-examined The goods mentioned in that agreement were removed to Isleworth previous to the agreement being signed—they were removed from Crawford-street to Isleworth and at Isleworth the value was a scertained by Mr Genna of No 36 Edgware-road Q Was any arrangement made between you and Robert Miers respecting any goods not mentioned in that agreement A Yes—that was just before the agreement was made—he was to have all his own good back with the exception of about 12l worth that I had sold to a Mrs Ashley and some others—the goods in the agreement were confined to what I had purchased of Walters and elsewhere but there was about 20l worth which did not go back to him—there were fixtures which I had sent to Green sale-room in Edgeware-road—Bartlett was the auctioneer—Miers received the money for those goods with my consent—they were fixture which had been removed frail the coffee-shop to Crawford-street which I had agree to pay 60l for Q Did Miers consent to take his portion of the goods back which resent him and the amount of the fixtures in payment of the whole amount you owed him except the costs of the action A When he had the good back be had been paid all except what I had pawned and the 12l worth—it was all arranged between us except the costs and we cried quits —I had an interview with him on the subject of the costs in White crown-street prison on the 19th of January—I asked if he had ascertained from Jennings and Turner the amount of costs because I wanted to have my good back—I wanted the difference paid over to me between the amount of costs and the value of the goods—he said Jennings and Turner told him it was about 100l —I asked if he would give me 50l for the difference which I thought would satisfy me with what I had had before because he had pawned something for me while I was in prison—I bad received money from him before—I wrote him a letter that day—this is it— looking at one —I wrote it on the day it bears date—at that time he was in possession the goods deposited as security—I had not received them back—I never had them nor the value except the sum he advanced me which was 10l or 11l —I intended to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act at one time but my friends did not wish it therefore I came out—I went in intending to take it as I had no money to pay my creditors—I wad very badly in wast of money at the time I wrote that letter—as he had said he would not give the 50l I wished him to leave the goods at a coffee-shop—he said he had no objection to give me the goods but the money he would not give me—I wanted the money to pay the prison fees and wrote this letter— read White Cross-street Jan 19th 1838 DEAE SIR —You said yourself this morning that the lawyer said the expenses would not be more than 100l and the 1l you brought for my ticking pawned to-day is all gone You will remember the goods valued to you is 180l and all I have received of you for goods pawned for me since I have been here is but 10l or 11l and the lawyer has the best part of that I want you to send me by bearer 18s to pay my prison fees and do not disappoint You will recollect for you are out of prison but I am in and feel it I shall expect that you will be as good as your word and send me the things to the Coffee-shop near Oxford-market that I told you of this day certain and pack them in small lots so that I can get them away as I want them and let them be such as I can raffle for If you will leave them soon enough I think I can sell some and pay Sidney by Monday and get out and if I do I shall have a bed there and shall send for you and if I don t I shall take the benefit as there will be only but 2/ more to pay the lawyer to finish it You know what I said to you about Maria and get Ellen to let me have as many little things as she can spare Yours truly WM MIDGLEY Q Who is Sidney mentioned in that latter A He is the plaintiff s attorney whose debt I was in for—Ellen is my wife s sister Mrs R Miers—Maria is Mill M York—my wife was in the family way at the time and I wanted some baby-linen—that is what I allude to about Ellen—then I wrote that letter I expected soon to get out the lawyer had been down to me two or three times—I asked one of the turnkeys to get a mesgenger to deliver the letter for me—and I received the 18s in answer to the letter from the same turnkey Q After you wrote that letter did you expect the goods would be sent to the coffee-shop mentioned in it A I did—I was not able to arrange with Sidney as I expected and that prevented my going to the coffee-shop to see if the goods were there—I saw Miers again about the 31st of January—he came in consequence of a note I sent him—this is it looking at it—read — To Mr Robert Miers Ingram-court—If you can spare time I wish to see you this afternoon as I have seen Mr Sidney to-day and have something to say to you Yours W IDGLEY White cross-street 31st January 1837 —I intended the date for 1838—Miers came to me and told me he had since called on Jennings and Turner who told him the expenses Would be 200l and he could not let me hare the goods he had left at the coffee-shop and he was going to fetch them away—then it turned But that He had left them at the wrong coffee-shop and He said he should go and fetch them away—by the coffee-shop near Oxford-market in my letter I alluded to Clutterbuck s which is twelve or fourteen doors from Oxford-market—I do not know the name of the street but it leads out of Regent-street and out of Oxford-street and into Oxford-market—I have been there—Clutterbuck was not acquainted with me but he knew me to be frequently at his house—I was present at the valuation of the goods at the shop at Isleworth by Genna—I occasionally served in that shop and Ann York did—the value of the stock there was 250l or from that to 300l —when I went to the shop first Mr Miers s name was put up—I do not know exactly when I first went there it was some time in August—after that the name of Ann York was up—that was about three weeks or a month after or may be not quite so long—she had just arrived from Lancashire—she managed the business—the stock was from 250l to 300l —cannot tell to 30l or 40l —I left Crawford-street three or four days after the bill became due and was dishonoured which was on the 27th—I never opened the shop—I declined opening it the day the bill became due—I knew I could pot open it when I had got no money—it was about the latter end of June or beginning of July—I then went into Mr Miers s employment—I continued with him at Isleworth and High-street till about October sometimes at Isleworth and sometimes at High-street—I left him in October because I was afraid of being arrested by my City Creditors—the persons of whom I had purchased goods—I resided in the Westminster-road from that time up to December—the prisoner told me of his taking the shop in Old Kent-road at the latter end of November or beginning of December—my wife was to manage that shop—About the 18th or 19th of December he called on me where I was then lodging in the Westminster-road—I was then out of employment—I mentioned to him that I wanted a situation for I had no friends nor money and he suggested my coming back to live with him again and I went on the 23rd of December to his shop in High-street Q Do you remember on any Sunday packing any goods A I do the day before Christmas-day—I assisted the prisoner in packing them at his shop—there was not more than 100l or 110l worth—not much more—I cannot exactly tell the amount—they were to go to Surrey-place Kent-road—he made no secret at all about it—I afterwards by hit directions packed up some other goods for the same place—there was not more then 40l worth or there might be 50l —the goods packed up then and on the Sunday did not come to so much as 200l —the goods were packed on the Sunday because we had been very busy during the week and had not time to do it—I continued in Mr Miers s employ till about the 9th of January—I was then taken in execution to Whitecross-street—I was taken early in the morning as I was cleaning the windows Q Can you tell while you were in his employ in High-street what was in your opinion the average amount of stock on the premises A From 2800l to 30000l —it was full that amount—we always continued at the same amount as when in Oxford-street—at the time I was taken away to Whitecross-street these things had been sent away and the things to Isleworth—I should think the stock then was about 2300l or 2400l —it was more than 2000l —I cannot ascertain nearer than that—I speak from my general practice—I have been seven or eight yean all trade Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q How old are you A Twenty next birthday—the 11th of February is my birthday—I am just past nineteen—when I was about to commence business in Crawford-street was eighteen years and six months old—I took the house—I was to pay fifty guineas a year rent—I married in February the same month in which I became eighteen years of age—I never opened my shop—I was taken into custody by Marriott the Bow-street officer on the lit of July—no I beg your pardon I know what you are inquiring about—it was on the 1st of July I hired the horse and chaise—I was at Newport Pagnell that day—I beg pardon for making a mistake before—I hired a horse and chaise to go five miles into the neighbourhood—I can give you a reason why I did it—I drove to London—I had some money in my pocket when I left Newport Pagnell but not above 5s 6s —I left my snuff-box at one of the toll-gates instead of paying the toll as I had not sufficient money to take me there—I will explain it as it may have a very different effect—I left the cushion of the gig at another toll-bar for the same reason and I left the box at a third for the same reason—I started from Newport Pagnell on Saturday afternoon about four or five o clock and was in London at five o clock in the morning or between five and six o clock—I did not look at the clock to see—the distance is fifty-two miles—I gave the name of Gardener—I can give you a reason for that—that was the only time I passed by that name—it is stated in that bill you have got there Q Were you aware that hand-bills were out offering 5l reward A Not till the officer came to my house and took me—he showed me the bill then— looking at a bill —this is the same bill at least a of it Q Well now were you after the lapse of some eight or ten days apprehended on a charge of horse-stealing A No—it was not so long as ten days nor a week—it was on Tuesday night they came to me and on Saturday I had the horse and gig and was just going back when they took me—I had the money in my pocket then—they pretended to make the charge—I was taken to Bow-street before Mr Minshull—he discharged me—I was remanded for about two hours because Mr Minsshull began to tell me I brought the horse away on a false intent—I was saucy to him and told him I had not and he threatened to remand me for a week but turned out different he only remanded me for two hours Q Pray did you send for Mr Miers the prisoner A Mr Miers came down to me without being sent for—he knew where I was gone—somebody went and told him—I never sent for him—after the two hours I was taken again before the Magistrate and he gave me a lecture I said nothing at all and he discharged me—there was no talk about sending me to Hertford goal for stealing the box—Mr Minshull told me I was liable if the Magistrate of the County liked to send me—I cannot tell whether it was in the County of Hertford that I left the box—I did not escape by getting Mr Miers to satisfy the owner—he gave him some money of mine—I was not committed to Hertford or any where—the owner had his box but not any thing else and I paid for it—I was going back on the Tuesday that I was apprehended—I am quite sure it was the Tuesday as I hired the horse and gig on the Saturday Q did you say when yon hired the horse and gig in the name of Gardener that you were going to one Lines in the neighbourhood A I did—I went down into the country to try to get money to go on with the action without borrowing money—I went to Richard Gardener to ask him to lend me money—I had sufficient money to take me down and when I got there he would not lend me any money—no I beg pardon I did not go to him then—I went to Newport Pagnell—I found it was too far to go to Lines and went there—he could not lend me any money only a few shillings—I intended to go to London and then take the horse and chaise back—when I got there the horse was so knocked up I could not take it back because it was rather an old horse—I meant to come to London to get the money to pay for the horse—I have no other explanation to offer—I know a person named Bartlett—I did not get him to sell a carpet belonging to Miers and receive the money as mine—he sold a carpet—itwas not mine—I received the money Q Did you ask him not to mention it to Miers A Not at the time I received the money—after the goods were sent to Bartlett to be sold Miers began to complain about what I owed him—it was before the arrangement was made—I had received 2l 10s —Miers said I owed him money—he wanted me to give the goods up to him which I did—I directly went to Bartlett not to tell him I had received the money as he asked me if I had received it and I had told him I had not although I had—I told Miers a falseoood and told Bartlett not to reveal it—Bowler who accepted the bill is my uncle—he did not owe me money but he promised to lend me some—when I went to ask him he told me he had not got it about him—I then asked him to give me a bill for 410l which he did Q How came the amount to be 410l A I had borrowed 18l of him—he asked me to give him some of it—I could not as I wanted to pay for my stock which was 400l —I could not give him 10l which he wanted—I told him I could not unless he put it in the bill and I would go and borrow it of my brother-in-law—he said very well I might get the 10l —I went back and told him I could not get the 10l as my brother-in-law was out and I never did give him the 10l —the bill was to be for 410l and I was to pay him 10l which I was to borrow—I do not know where the bill is—it is lost—the verdict was for the defendant and I have never been troubled about the bill—the money is lost but the bill is in the Court of Queen s Bench I believe Q Did not your uncle resist the payment of that bill on the ground that it was a forgery that it had been drawn and accepted for 10l only and altered to 400l Q That was his plea but it was merely to get off the payment—he never mentioned a word about forgery—the defence was that it had been altered from 10 to 410—the Jury found a verdict for the defendant—I saw the bill when I swore an affidavit here some month before the trial Q On your oath was there not an alteration on that bill that anybody could see with an eye glass A There was an alteration thus far that behind it was my name and Robert Miers and June 27 the day it because due—that was all the alteration—I was to have that bill instead of money—I was not examined on the trial—I believe if I had the verdict would have been for the plaintiff—I suppose they thought they bad proof sufficient without me—I was in Basinghall-street at the time at a public-house waiting to hear the decision—I believe the prisoner was subpoenaed by the defendant—I do not know whether he was called—I never asked him—Thomas Miers was the plaintiff in the action—I never made any agreement about that—I paid the bill to Robert Miers—I was subpoenaed for the plaintiff and ready to be called—nobody but the attorney knew where I was—I had lived at West Ham for a few days before the trial—I was to be found—I was in London streets every day—I was in London on the Saturday night as the trial was to come on on the 24th of November—it came on very early in December Q When you heard the verdict was for the defendant where did you pass the next ten days of your life A In Westminster-road—people told me there was an officer looking for me on a charge of forgery but I did not believe it—I was told one night when I went home to Crawford-street that there was an officer waiting for me—Mrs Ashley wished me to go down the area steps but I would go out at the door—I had sold her some of the goods Q Since the verdict you have taken no further trouble about this large sum of 410l A I have heard a new trial was applied for and I believe a Mr Kelly applied for it and that it was lost—I never went to the house in Surrey-road while it was open as a shop—I was there on the 24th if last month—the name of Clark over the door was intended for my wife—she took that name because it would be foolish to open in why name when I was in Whitecrow-street—that was the principal reason why my name was not over the door—I was not in Whitecross-street at the time but I expected to go every day—my wife took it and began in the name of Clark—that is the fact there is no secret at all about it Q When was it the prisoner saw you in Whitecross-street before that letter was written A On the 19th of January I desired him to send the property to the coffee-shop—I did not say Mr Clutterbuck s Q You say in the letter be as good as your word and send me the things to the coffee-shop near Oxford-market that I told you of to-day you had seen him before A Yes and told him the coffee-shop near Oxford-market—I did not tell him any name—he asked me what street it was in—I told him I did not know—I did not know there was such a number of coffee-shops near the market or I might have been more particular—he was not to tell them my name—that would be of no use Q How were you to get them A I should have gone and asked if the things had been left there for me—they knew me and where I lived at Clutterbuck s—Miers was to have left his name or say a young man would call for them who comes for me—the property was to be in small pareeln—50l or 60l worth of property done up in small parcels—I indended to take one away at a time and sell them Q Were they all to be left at the same coffee-shop or at different names A He was to leave them where he liked—at least at the coffee-shop nearly opposite Oxford-market which is Clutterbuck s—I made a mistake saying he was to leave them where he liked—he was to leave them at his one coffee-shop—he had pawned some ticking to raise 1l for me—I eletive it was a day or two before the 19th if not that day—he brought the money that day—he had pawned other articles for me to the amount of 10l or 11l in different pledges—I never looked at the tickets—he brought he the money while I was in prison—those articles have been redeemed—I have the tickets up to Mr Jervis Miers s attorney—Miers gave him some and I gave him some that I had pawned before—I pawned some in Auqust—I was taken in execution for about fifteen guineas expenses and all—he original debt was five guineas which I had owed to a tailor for not more then three or four months—the action was commenced in August or September—I had the clothes in May or June—I was served with a copy of a print in July I believe—I heard no more of it and was taken in execution on January—I remained in prison from the 9th of January till about the 10th of February—my friends wished me to get out and Mr Jervis arranged it I believe—I do not know how—by my friends I mean my relations—the Gardeners wished me to come out—none of them wished me to stop here—I have not been in prison since—if I could not have got out I must have taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act—I took steps to do so—my debts and liabilities amounted to about 878l including the£410 bill which I had endorsed to Thomas Miers and was liable to—if I had had the money I should have been made to pay it—when I endorsed the bill I owed Robert Miers 60l for coffee-house fixtures 40l or 50l for shop goods and between 20l and 30l money lent—I have paid none of my debts except the fifteen guineas to the tailor—Miers had the goods back—I am now goring to take a situation—Mr Jervis has been allowing me money to keep me till this trial because I was going into the country to take a situation—I have been living in West-square—Mr Jervis has lent me not above 7l or 8l —I have not been in the gallery of this Court nor in the Court till I tune in just now MR PAYNE Q Had you an uncle of the name of Gardener A Yes living at Cranfield seven or eight miles on the other side Newport Pagnel—he is a clergyman and was formerly a lawyer—I used his name for the purpose of getting the chaise lent to me—I had not the slightest intent of making away with it—I left the cushion for the toll—I did not attempt to dispose of the horse or any thing that the man will tell you where I left it—I went two or three times a day to see about it—the Magistrate said he hoped it would be a warning to me not to do so again as if it was in anybody s hands but those who knew my friends perhaps they would have committed me—but he did not believe I did not intend to return the chaise—the bill was on a 6s stamp which is proper for 410l —I cannot tell why nobody but the attorney was to know I was at the public-house on the day of the trial—I had heard nothing about a charge of forgery then—I was afraid of being arrested by my City creditors—it was three weeks after the time that I heard an officer was waiting and desired to go down the area steps—no steps have been taken to prosecute me about that bill Q Was the threat about the forgery after your uncle had promised to pay 200l and give another bill A Yes when we went with the bill be said nothing about forgery—it was when he was arrested—I had on means of supporting myself to come here only by receiving money from Mr Jervin CHARLES HAYNES On the 19th of January I was a turnkey of whitecross-street prison Midgley was confined there—about seven o clock that evening I was called to the gate to get a messenger to send a letter to High-street Marylebone—I received the letter from Midgley—I think I should know it again— looking at the letter produced —I know nothing about the contents—I have no doubt that is the letter—I gave it to Davin a messenger with instructions to bring me an answer back—he returned about nine o clock that evening and was admitted by another officer name Dawson—he gave me a paper containing 18s which I handed over to Midgley—I opened it and counted it first—he had given me 1s befpre and 6d more when I gave him the 18s WILLIAM HENRY TURNER re-examined I was the attoney in for action for the bill of exchange—it was in my custody till the trial—it was on a 6s stamp—Midgley was in attendance to give evidence—he was and public-house in Basinghall-street—nobody except myself knew where have as I expected the defendant s attorney would have had him taken me custody to prevent his being examined—that was the only reason—he was not called as my counsel deemed it would be more prudent not to state the circumstances relative to the application made by Midgley and that we should merely prove the handwriting of the defendant—Mr Butt and Mr Keating were the counsel—I at first thought the costs might be about 10l or a little more—but I found the defendant s costs were made out to at enormous amount 236l or about that—I took off about 125l in the taxation and brought it to about 110l or 111l which made the whole costs about 200l —there was a motion for a new trial—I am not aware whether I personally acquainted the prisoner of the increased amound of costs but he was aware of it by some means I know MR KELLY Q Your costs were nearly 100l A They have been made out—I speak roughly—I think they would be nearly 100l —when I spoke of the costs as 100l I spoke of it at the commencement of the action and did not know How the thing might go—it was at the commencement of the suit—I thought they would be about 100l Q Can you take upon yourself to say that you at any time after the verdict had been given told Miers the costs would be only 100l A I am not quite certain but I think it most unlikely that I could have made such a statement because my own costs I could form some opinion of—was in Court during the trial—the defence was forgery by means of altering the bill from 10 to 410—I think Lord Chief Justice Denman inspecter it with a magnifying glass—there was a glass—the bill was impounded by order of the Court—I have not been paid my costs—my client Mr Thomas Miers gave me a cheque for the defendant s costs and I paid them—mine will be paid—I have only lately delivered a bill for that and other business MARIA MIDGLEY I am the sister of Mr Miers s wife I was married to Midgley in January 1837—I was then living in King-street Regent-street at a coffee-shop—I was placed there by Miers—I afterwards went to live with him and assist him in his business—I cannot tell the—it was in 1837—I went from King-street to High-street in May 1837 left about the latter end of November I think—I think we went to Crawford-street in June—we did not open shop there because it was not condenientt—I cannot tell the reason why he did not open it he gave up the shop and fixtures to Mr Miers—I cannot tell whether he was indebted to Miers at that time—he was afterwards to what extent I cannot tell—the transactions between them were to a certain extent without my knowledge—I have been to Isleworth occasionally but not to reside there—I was in Surrey-place Kent-road—when the shop at Isleworth was given up the stock came to Surrey-place—about 300l worth came there Q Having been in business some time can you judge the amount A It is from that I speak and other things were brought from High-street to amount of about 200l according to my judgment making about 500l I believe the shop in Surrey-place was opened on the 16th of January February—it was February I think—I had the management of it which is paid for Q When you went to live in High-street in May did you form any estimate of the value of the stock at Miers s A No I cannot tell you at all about it—the shop was well stocked that is all I can say—it continued well stocked down to November—when I left there was a quantity of lace there a great number of shawls moreens and all sorts of linen-drapery—during the time I was there I frequently heard Mr Miers complain of the escape of gas and also his lodger in the first-floor named Smith—I frequently found the smell offensive—there were seven or eight burners in the shop I think some in the window and some in the middle of the shop—those in the window were in a central direction as well as I can tell and three at the counter—the pipes were carried through the counter—there was a stall-board crossing the front of the shop in the window—shawls and other articles hang in the window for show—they occasionally remained there during the night—I know the gas-lights were not left burning during the night while I was there—I cannot tell exactly what quantity of plate Mrs Miers had—there was some in the house when I left in November—I saw it in use during the time I was there up to the time of my leaving and a fortnight after—I went occasionally after I left—Mrs Miers had a child s coral and bells Q Was that yours A It was given to her by my husband—I have no family—I had a black trunk which I took with me from High-street—it was not sent to me—there was part of my wearing apparel in it—I went away in a coach—I cannot exactly tell when—it was on a Thursday and I believe the Thursday previous to the shop in Surrey-place being opened on Saturday which was early in January—there was nothing in it but my wearing apparel—there was no other black trunk in the place while I was there Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Where are you living now A In East-square which is in Southward I believe perhaps yon can tell better than I can—I have given my direction that is all I can tell—I cannot tell where it is Q If you were on London-bridge which is the way to it A lf I was there I could find it but I cannot tell yon—I have lived there about a month with my husband—it is in North-place East-square Southwark—the landlord s name is Woodrow—it is a private house—I have one front room on the first-floor—you know the way better than I can tell and I shan t answer any such questions Q Do you mean when you say you cannot tell that you will not tell A I won t tell you—I am twenty-five years old—my maiden name was Maria York that is the only name I have gone by besides my present name—I have not gone by any name but my husband s since I have been married—I have gone by the name of Clark if that is what you mean he no other name—I was married in February 1837 Q I thought you said just now it was in January A Well perhaps I did—it was January or February I cannot tell exactly which you did not puzzle me so much I could answer you more straightfotwed—it was in January I am quite sure and I will swear it was about the 12th is it essential for me to tell the church—I will not tell you Q Were you married in London or the country A I shall not answer that question—I swear I am married—I was married to Midgly of Hanover church which is in Hanover-square I believe—it was on the 12th of January I believe and by licence—I do not know my husband age exactly when we married—I do not know when his birth-day it Q In the month of December last were you expecting to be confined— Here the witness quitted the box and was about to leave the Court COURT You must come back Witness I shall not come back COURT You must— Witness returned Now answer the question—It is very necessary for the purposes of this case—Q Did you expect to be confined in December A Yes MR CLARKSON Q Have you been confined since December A No—in January last I was living in Surrey-place—I have been in wast of baby-linen—that was previous to my expecting to be confined of course—I cannot tell you either day nor date—it was later than last month—I connot tell you when it was Q Was it at Christmas last —When do you expect to be confined A I cannot tell not to speak the truth—I have no idea when I shall to confined not to a week or a month—I am not acquainted with any of the coffee-shops in the neighbourhood of Oxford-market Q Did you expect to have any baby-linen wrapped up with a new bell and prayer-book and a child s coral and bells to be sent to a coffee-shop near Oxford-market A I expected them to be sent to me but did not know where they were to be sent to— looking at the bible and prayer-bell —I have seen these before in High-street—I cannot tell when I saw then last—I do not know Clutterbuck who keeps a coffee-shop—I never hand my husband speak of him—I did not hear him say he expected the balylinen and books to be left at Clutterbuck s—I did not know such a name—I was backwards and forwards at Isleworth occasionally but not to stop—my sister Ann York managed the business there—she is not here—she is very ill—she has a bad cold I believe but I do not know exactly—she does not live near us—I cannot tell where she lives now—she has lately married a person named Milligan—I lived in Ingram-court before I went to East-square—we had three rooms there—I lived there ever since I left Surrey-place—I forget what month that was in—it was between summer and winter I believe—the prisoner and his wife went to Ingram-court the moraing after the fire—it was morning before they could get there from the time she fire broke out—I cannot tell when Ann Wright come there—I did not see her then nor on the Sunday or Monday after the fire—I do not know on what day I saw her—I cannot recollect whether it was the Tuesday Q Was she living with you and Mr and Mrs Miers in Iagram-court till she was taken before the Magistrate to be examined as a witness A of came to Ingram-court on the Monday night and she came I believe on Tuesday—it was a fortnight after the fire that I came there—Mr Miers was hot there at all—Mrs Miers was and she received me there—Ann Wright was living there when I went there—I do not recollect her going before the Magistrate—I recollect the officer or somebody from the Fire Office coming and taking her away Q Why did you think it was somebody from the Fire Office A Because she has been in custody ever since Q On your oath did not your sister in your presence after Miers had been taken into custody desire her to answer no questions A No I deny it—I firmly deny that assertion both on my sister s side and my own—as to any other person I cannot answer for others—nobody did so in my presence—nothing of the sort was said to her at any time—I took the name of Clark at Surrey-place by Mien s desire—I carried on the business in that name being my mother s maiden name—the goods at Surrey-place were supplied from High-street as I wanted them—there were none but what came from High-street or Isleworth—I lived with my husband in crawford-street during the time that house was being fitted up—according to my judgment the whole stock which came from Isleworth to Surrey-place amounted to about 300l and I should say I received about 200l worth from High-street—the stock in Crawford-street came from the City from different warehouses I cannot tell where—none of it come from High-street to my knowledge—Miers did not come there from High-street with a coach-load of goods to my knowledge—I will swear I did not accompany him with any—several parcels came to Surrey-place by the Parcels Delivery Company—I cannot say whether there were Irish linens among them—I am not certain—some silks came—no boxed of ribbons came—there were a few lengths of ribbons—I do not think there was any delivery of boxes of ribbons in Surrey-place—there was not a dozen—no goods were brought there in a cart to my knowledge—I know Mrs Paul who lived at No 29 Q Will you venture to swear there were not boxes of ribbons and large parcels of goods brought in carts and coaches and by Miers himself to Surrey-place A There never were parcels of ribbons nor any kind of mercery goods brought there in a cart or coach or van—the principal stock of ribbons was very small and came from Isleworth and a few were sent down with other goods in different parcels—they were coloured ribbons which I wanted as for boxes or parcels of ribbons they never came to that place either in cart van cab or coach—the stock and furniture came altogether from Isleworth in a van—I cannot tell whether the house in Surrey-place was taken by the week or year—I did not take it—I believe it was not taken weekly—I cannot tell How the house in Crawford-street was taken—we staid there three weeks or a month—the stock was taken from there to High-street I believe—I cannot tell the value of H—I can give no idea of it—I cannot tell who took it to High-street—I do not know whether my husband did—I did not accompany him I will swear—I am not at present doing any thing towards obtaining a living—I do not entirely depend on ray husband—I have different friends who contribute to my support—my principal friends live in Lancashire—my uncle Cullen contributes to my support—he does not make me a regular allowance—I do not know How long my husband has been out of a situation—I do not know How he has been able to live—I have got my living for the last three months through the medium of my friends—I do not know when my husband came out of prison—he did not come to live with me as soon as he came out—I was living in Ingram-court then I believe but I do not recollect either day or dates and therefore unless I can tell the truth I shall not answer any questions Q Now give me the name of the person at whose expense you have been living for the last month A — hesitating —I shall not tell you—I did not leave High-street on one occasion with Miers with parcels some of which contained plate on my oath—I did not leave with him with a box parcel or bundle containing two table-spoons two salt-spoons half-a-dozen tea-spoons and a fish slice—I have seen them—I saw them last at High-street about a fortnight before the fire—Miers had more than that—I have seen four table spoons and more than half a dozen tea-spoons—I should say they had a dozen tea-spoons and four salt spoons—that was all the plate to my knowledge—the lodger frequently complained of the gas—the last complaint I recollect was very shortly before Mr Smith left the house—I cannot tell when he left—I believe it was in the summer of last year—the gas was always put out at night—that was particularly attended to—it was Miers s custom while I was there always to look to the gas both in High-street and Oxford-street—I never knew of his leaving it burning all night while I was at either place—if such a thing had happened I think I should have known it because I was generally last—he always extinguished the gas after the shop was closed—he looked to it more particularly on account of the smell from escapes—I was at Surrey-place on last Christmas-day—I slept there on Christmas-eve—Miers was there on Christmas afternoon I believe—not in the morning—he did not arrive there in the morning in a coach on my oath neither in coach cab or any conveyance—he did come but in no conveyance—I cannot tell what time he

had money as I wanted it and goods as I wanted them placed to my account—Miers is a little in my debt now—I never knew or heard he was going to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act nor ever heard that my husband was going to do so—I did not know he had filed his schedule and advertised to do so—I never heard it till now—I had no notion of it—I was not in the habit of going to see him in Whitecross-street—I went once two or three weeks before he came out—I know Mr Jervis the attorney—he has lent me money—I do not know when he did so last—it was some time last week—the last sum I had was 1l I believe—I had none from him the week before—I have not been supported entirely by Mr Jervis nor principally—I cannot tell How much I have had from him since Miers has been in confinement—I cannot tell where I have been waiting while attending here—it is a coffee-shop I believe—I was fetched from there to come over to give evidence—Mr Jervis has not been in and out to me Q Tell me any other means of support you have had except through Miers s attorney since the sale of goods to Brooks A I have had money of my own which I have spent besides what I received from Mr Jervis—I got it from my friends as I told you before—I cannot tell when I got it exactly—I am living with my husband in East-square—Mr Jervis has kept me till after the trial and Mr Midgley too—he kept us from taking a situation in the drapery business Q With whom A Any person who would engage an—I have had no situation within the last three months when I left Surrey-place—I call that a situation—I have had no means of support since except from Mr Jervis and my friends—I cannot tell what they gave me MR THOMAS Q Do you know whether Miers owed sufficient to go through the Insolvent Court A I cannot tell—I know he owed his brother a considerable amount—I never heard of his being about to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act—I know Ann Wright was taken away by somebody—I have not seen her since The Court then adjourned Monday April 9th — Continued ELIJAH GENNA I am a linen-draper in the Edgware-road I have known Miers about ten years—I remember seeing him at my house in July last—he came there in consequence of what passed between him and me—I went with him to his shop at Isleworth to value on the part of Miers some-goods that Mr Midgley was to make over to Miers—I saw an inventory at that time—I do not know where it is now—it was the inventory of the stock at Isleworth—I went to compare the stock with the inventory—not to value it—he took them at the invoice price—the invoice price of the whole goods there I think was about 181l or 182l —I am not positive as to the amount—I left the goods there—I have been to the prisoner s shop in High-street—I was there about a fortnight before the fire—I have been in business about four years—I cannot say what the amount of his stock then was—I did not take an inventory—his shop appeared to me to be well stocked—I was there a fortnight before the fire—I cannot fix any date in January—I am certain it was in January—it was not after Christmas-day—I have nothing by which I can fix the date at all—I cannot recollect the day—the shop appeared well stocked COURT Q When was the fire do you know A I do not know MR JAMES Q Was the fire in January A I do not know Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q Are you a linen-draper A Yes I am and carry on business in Edgware-road—I do not keep a large stock—the floating value of my stock is about 1000l —I purchase my stock as I require it from time to time at wholesale house—I was in the habit of going to Mr Miers s shop occasionally not very frequently—he was an old friend of mine—I have no means of knowing the state of his trade during the last year—he has had goods from me now and then that he might want at the time to save going into the City—I mean to say his dealings have been confined to that—he did not send for large quantities—I had a running account with him of goods I supplied him and goods I took of him in return Q Now did he not deal with you from time to time for goods in April May June July August September and October 1837 A Very likely he did—he did have goods about that time—I cannot tell you the times Q Now look at this bill of yours I ask you whether he did not buy small quantities of goods from you from time to time in April May June July August September and October A He did—on the 22nd of August and 5th of September he bought several quantities of various different articles—there were eleven different articles on the 22nd of August and twenty-one different articles on the 5th of September—my bill from the beginning of June to some time in October amounted to 27l 18s 8d and that was settled by goods not by cash—I did not see Mr Miers for about a week after the fire—it was in July that I went to Isle worth to see that the articles were rightly valued—there was an inventory made—the agreement that was made between the parties formed part of the inventory—I saw the agreement and witnessed it—the agreement was separate from the inventory—there was a separate inventory annexed—the invoice prices were put on the inventory—in my judgment the invoice prices were fair and correct—the inventory was on one long sheet of paper—they were goods I think that Mr Midgley had had in Crawford-street when he began business—I believe the principal part of the goods were purchased from Mr Walters—I heard that in Miers s presence—I do not know Mr Walters—Mr Walters s invoices were produced is the course of my inquiry about the value—I do not know what became of them afterwards—I have not been at all active in getting up this defence not at all—I have not applied to people to become witnesses—I called on two who I believe are here—they are Mr Ludlow and Mr Smith MR JAMES Q Just explain what you called on them for A I called on them to speak to Mr Miers s character MR KELLY Q What is the Christian name of Mr Smith —A I do not know—he is at the Bazaar in Baker-street MR JAMES Q Just look over the invoice and state as far at you can the whole amount of goods Mr Miers had from you between April and October A This is the sum total—27l 18s 8d —from June to October that amount of goods passed—I was paid in goods—it is usual for two drapers to barter goods instead of money—there is no item here large enough to give an order for to a wholesale house—when one draper has not goods by him which a customer applies for another draper supplies that customer—that is frequently done—I recollect going to Miers s house for a strip of black merino about a fortnight before the fire—I got the merino I wanted—he had a quantity of merino—there were a quantity of ribbons in the stock at Isle worth DAVID DAVIES I am sometimes employed as a messenger at Whitecross-street prison—I carry messages for the turnkey—he gives them to me On the 19th of January I remember taking a letter to Mr Miers s shop in High-street Marylebone—I believe this to be the same letter— looking at it —I brought back 18s which I gave to the turnkey who had given me the letter to be given to Midgley—I was brought up as a linen-draper—I went into Miers s shop when I took the letter there—it appeared to me as shops are generally—if there had been a remarkable deficiency in the stock I should no doubt have observed it—I did not observe any thing remarkable Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q I presume you did not read this letter A No it was wafered—Mr Miers s shop was rather a small one—it might be about twenty-four feet by fifteen—it is twenty-six or twenty-seven years since I was in business as a linen-draper GEORGE SKINNER I am a dyer and scourer I used to call at Mr Miers s on business—I first knew him when he was in Oxford-street—I was in the habit of calling at High-street from the time he went there up to the time of the fire—the last time I was there was on the Saturday at the fire took place at night—I called for work—dyeing—I generally called once or twice a week—I did not call with a cart that day—I could not take any thing away with me that day—I said I would ask first and if there was any thing I would take it on my return as I was going into the City—it was on that Saturday that Mr Murphy said would be the coldest day—Saturday was the day of my being in London—I recollect its being a very cold day my riding outside an omnibus—Miers said if I came by that way on my return I might call in and he showed me some goods which he said were a very bad condition and wanted dying—the shop looked as full as ever had seen it—I had often been into the shop and if there had been much difference I should have seen it—I had often observed that the shop was very well stocked for a small shop—I saw no difference—if there had been my material difference I must have seen it Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Where do yon carry on business A Crawford-street—I have been there I think about three yean and a half MR THOMAS Q Did you call at Miers s again in the evening A Yes—should think it was more than seven o clock—it could not be eight o clock I took sway the goods to dye—I saw the prisoner himself—I took away me common merinos that wanted dyeing with plaid shawls and a few handkerchiefs—he was particular in beating me down as to prices—being common articles he said the merinos would not fetch more than 18d a yard perfect—they were very poor goods MR DOANE Q Do you keep the whole house in which you live A have a lease of it for twenty-one years—I let out a part—I 1st out be lint floor room furnished and the whole of the second unfurnished—it is on eight-roomed house—there is no attic—the only part I occupy as a dyer and scourer is the ground floor—there is an area and a large yard—I occupy the two kitchens which I have knocked into one and made a large workshop of it—that is under ground—there is a large yard in the rear of the premises—the dye-house is there—that is merely a shed over part of the yard—that is part of the premises which I use as dyer and scourer—I reckon I keep two or three men regularly—I had two working to-day when I left home—I have been in the habit of calling on Miers for work—we sometimes employ as many as twenty females and at times as many as thirty in making shawls—when I have called on Miers on business I have generally taken goods away that were so soiled that it was necessry to have them dyed—he never gave me any thing that was not wanted to be dyed—I should say that it was after twelve o clock that I first called on Saturday—it might be one o clock—I think it was before two o clock—I saw Miers himself MR THOMAS Q What time did you set out from home A Mr Mien s was the first place I called at—it is not above a quarter of a mile from my house—I think I started after twelve o clock—I occupy as much of the premises as is necessary for business—only the under part of it—I sleep in the parlour—mine being valuable goods I sleep there for protection—I have lived there about three years and a half—merino becomes faded by being kept and requires dying to make it saleable—I really cannot tell the value of goods I took away—perhaps they were worth 6l ELIZABETH WELLS I live with Mrs Whipple in Crown-court Aldersgate-street She is a stay and corset maker—she supplied Mr Miers with stays—I was in the habit of going to Mr Miers s shop in High-street—I was there about ten days before the fire—I do not know when the in was—I went with four pairs of stays—I stopped about an hour a brought back an order for a dozen pairs—the shop was not different what I usually saw it—I had been in the habit of going there since May 1837 about every fortnight—I did not notice any silk cloaks there particularly—there were merino cloaks—the cloaks were on stands—my attetion was not directed to silk cloaks particularly Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q Does Mrs Whipple carry a large business A Not very large—she keeps her books and account herself—it was about ten days before the fire occurred that I had it order to make the stays—they were never delivered WILLIAM WALTERS I am town traveller to my brothers they carry on business at No 7 Wood-street Cheap side they are wholesale dealer in lace and ribbons I have known Miers about eighteen month—I have done business with him longer than that—they were not large dealing—he continued to deal with us up to just before the fire—I remember dining with the prisoner at High-street on the Thursday before the fire—the shelves were full and the shop dressed out in the usual manner—I do not make any observation respecting the stock—it appeared to be wed stocked—I really did not take notice whether there was any silver plate a dinner—the table appeared in the usual way as when I had dined the before—there were spoons—I did not notice what kind—I do not know what the spoons were made of—after dinner I know I had a silver spoke in some gin and water which I took—that was a small tea-spoon—I had dined there before MR KELLY Q Are not the particulars of goods you furnished as follows — reading —1835 October to November 10th 15l 19s November 12th to February 11th 1836 20l 0s 7d March 3rd to April 5th 49l 4s 7d May 9th and 12th 34l 12s 11d then in the course in 1836 while he was in Oxford-street five sums 23l 1s 21l 7s 9d 34l 5s 7d 38l 19s 3d and 10l 16s 10d and in 1837 February 21st to March 2nd 15l 9s 2d April 4th to May 18th 32l 9s 4d May 23rd to July 18th 15l 16s 2d August 8th to September 12th 15l 15s 9d and September 26th to December 12th 18l 14s 2d making about 90l from April 4th to December 12th A I should suppose the would be about the amount MR PAYNE Q Do you know whether your brother sold any goods to a person of the name of Midgley A Yes—Mr Miers opened some drawers before the fire happened and showed me some shawls—they appeared to me to be rich handsome ones—there were about four or five wrappers of them—there were some of them I should say worth from 40s to 50s —others not so much—I did not look particularly at them but one I took particular notice of—this was in the winter—I should say it was about a couple of months before the fire that the drawers were opened—they would not be visible to persons coming into the shop Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Were the wrappers undone for the purpose of showing them to you A Yes—they were taken out of the drawers because Mrs Miers was asking him for a shawl that was the cause—I think I know a plated spoon when I see it—the spoon I had in my grog was a silver one—I had no necessity to examine it when I had it in my hand—I can tell by the feeling or handling of it—I saw it with my eyes—I think there is a small account between the prisoner and my brothers—I have no doubt of it—I should think the amount of it is from 10l to 13l not more than that to the best of my knowledge—I cannot tell when I last received money on account because I have not seen the books—there was generally bills drawn—I cannot tell whether any bill became due or any money was paid since January last without fetching the books—I was not told to bring he books here with me—my brother is not here—I know what are called dummies in the trade Q Are you able to distinguish by walking through a linen-draper s shop How much is real stock and How much is dummies A You may badge what portion of them but unless you look minutely you cannot tell—I did not examine the shawls so very minutely—I merely took them up in my hand to examine the quality—they were black grounds with shawl orders—what are called filled shawls—they were filled half & yard square—they were filled shawls—I mean by that they were worked in the middle—I did not see the middles of them—I cannot say whether they were worked in the middle—I saw the work was on the fold—I do not think here was any border—I did not see the middles of them but they were worked with silk and cotton I suppose—there was a pattern on them—of course I cannot tell what—I can tell the difference between a plain shawl with a worked border and a filled shawl—they were filled shawls with work all over—I did not look minutely into them—I do not know then I was first told I should be a witness—I cannot recollect—the subcena was sent over to me on Friday morning at half-past six o clock—about a fortnight before they said perhaps I might be wanted—perhaps before that—it was when the trial was coming on—but I was not subcenaed—my brother lives at the warehouse—I am the traveller—my brother is in town now—I never heard that he was subpoenaed—he is at the warehouse—I supplied goods to Midgley—I cannot say when that was without the books—it was about when he first commenced business in Crawford-street—we understood from Mr Miers that he had got property—we supplied him with goods on that representation Q Just look at that plated spoon was that such a one as you had in your grog A I should think not—I cannot tell whether it was such a shape as this—I know it was silver from handling it—as far as I know it was thinner here—I have said that it was stouter and slanted off here—that is not the sort of spoon—I will swear that it is not the spoon—we have never been paid our account from Midgley—I cannot say what the amount is—somewhere near 100l —I believe no part of that has been paid—I have not seen Mr Jarvis since the prisoner has been in custody nor anybody else—I cannot say whether my brother has but I should think not—my brother has no security for Midgley s account nor any bill—I left the goods without taking any bill from him—I have never applied for a bill since—I do not know one Clark as connected with this transaction—not concerning Midgley s goods Q Now do you mean to tell us on your oath that you have not learnt since this man has been in custody that if he was convicted you would never get your debt but that you will get it if he is not A Certainly not not from anybody—such a statement has never been made to me nor to my brother that I know of—I never heard it—this is the first time I have heard it—I have not taken any pains since the prisoner has been in custody to obtain our debt from Midgley—the goods were supplied Midgley six months ago I should think—I should think be is not worth farthing—I had no notice from him nor saw any advertisement from his that he was about to take the benefit of the Act—I never could see him some time—I looked after him after the shop was closed—I am not away that the goods sent to Midgley went to Miers—I have no doubt some of the might—I cannot say that the greater part did—I have inquired of Miers I do not know from Miers that he has bad the goods I supplied Midgley was—I will swear he has not told me so—I applied to Miers for me to a Midgley—I applied to him because if Midgley did not open he Midgley had better let me have the goods back—I was not aware that the good had been sent to Miers—I did not follow them—I have not seen then a any time—I never went there to see them—they were gauze ribbons and lace goods to the amount of 100l and plain ribbons—there were three four sorts of ribbons—I could not tell without I saw the book why there were—I was never at the shop at Isleworth or at the shop in Surrey-place—I never knew there was one there till I heard of the goods being taken from there—I cannot recollect who I heard that from—it was talked of in the trade—I did not know it from Miers nor from Mr Jervis to my knowledge—I have never talked to Mr Jervis about it nor about the goods there—I knew the goods were sold to Mr Brooks in the he rough—Mr Brooks told me so—I think he told me he bought then Mr Jervis Q Were you on intimate terms with Mr Miers A I was as in mate as most of the other customers I called there—I have dined they two or three times—it has happened when going round there that he on occasionally asked me in—he did not tell me that the shop Midgley was to take in Crawford-street was to be his Miers s or that Mrs Midgley was to carry it on for him—I never heard him say that he had taken another shop in Surrey-place and another sister was to carry that on for him—in that he had opened a shop at Isleworth where he had sent another since to take charge—he never disclosed that to me—I did not know Midgly was under age when I supplied him with the goods in Crawford-street saw he was young but I thought he was of age of course by his appearance—I thought he looked of age—if I had known he was not I certainly should not have supplied him with goods—I became acquainted with his by his being at Mr Miers s—Mr Miers did not tell me he was under age Q Had you any means of judging of his solvency except what you get from Mr Miers A No except what Midgley said himself that he should have from about 400l to 600l —Mr Miers confirmed that—I heard in the course of the winter that Midgley was in Whitecross-street—that opened my eyes that we should never get paid for the goods—I felt satisfied of that—I did not go to the prison—I saw Mr Miers soon after—I cannot say the day—it was my regular round to call—I said to him Mr Miers you told me that man was a man of property and confirmed his own statement of having 400l or 600l and you have let us in for 100l it is very odd —I was aware before that that we should not be paid but I did not express my surprise to Mr Miers—Mr Miers told me that be was in prison when I called on him—I expected before that be was insolvent because we did not get our money for our account—I called in Crawford-street and found he was gone—I found the shop shut up—that was the first intimation I had which made me doubt—I believe I called on Mien from Crawford-street—I cannot tell when that was—it was soon after he was supplied with he goods in the autumn—I asked where he was and Miers said he did not know—he did not tell me he had served in his shop and had continued to never there the greater part of autumn—it was a very short time before the here that I learnt he was arrested—let me see it was about a month before he fire but I do not speak positively—it is not my duty to keep my brother s accounts or to know what sums are paid that is the clerk s duty—his son knows what sums were paid—he is in town MR PAYNE Q Was it any part of your brother s practice go round the different shops A No he would know nothing about the prisoner s stock—I understood Midgley to represent that he should have the or 600l from an uncle—he told me his uncle was about receiving his rents and he had a bill—that was not in Miers s presence—it was up at his own place—I understood from him that he was to obtain the money by bill of his uncle Q Do you know whether it is the practice to have dummies in upper shelves of linen-drapers shops A If they want filling up at all—the gas smokes the goods on the upper shelves Q Do you know whether it is the practice to have shops in different parts and in different names A Some houses do open one or two houses if they are in extensive business—if I had the least doubt about the spoon I used being silver I would not swear it—our accounts were generally paid by bills—Glover was the name of our clerk—he has left us now but I dare say we could find him—bills could not have been dishonoured by Miers without my knowing it—I should not have gone on dealing with him If his bills had been dishonoured—we should have made further inquiry—we always considered him a very respectable man—I sold the goods to Midgley at his house in Crawford-street—some part of them were sold in our warehouse and were sent to Crawford-street MR KELLY Q I have just read that the goods supplied between April 1837 and December 1837 both inclusive amount altogether to about 82l is that about the amount of goods with which your house supplied Miers between those periods A I cannot say to a certainty unless I could see our ledger —a tradesman would keep up his stock and not be quite out of an article JOHN GOVIER I am a draper s assistant but am out of a situation at present I once lived with Mr Miers in Oxford-street—I went to him in the latter part of January 1837 and left in April the same year—I went with him to High-street—I assisted in removing the stock from Oxford-street to High-street—I remained about three weeks in his service in High-street—he removed from Oxford-street on the 25th of March Q About what was the value of his stock when you were with him in Oxford-street A Between 2000l and 3000l —I was not there when he took stock—he had about the same value of stock when I left him in High-street as when I was in Oxford-street—I went to live with him again in the month of June and remained about a fortnight or three weeks—during all the time I was with him he replaced the stock he fold by other purchases to keep it up—the stock was about the same the last time I was with him in July 1837—I should say there was no sensible diminution—the value of the stock was from 2000l to 2500l —I should say when I left the value of the stock was 2500l —it was considerably above 2000l —it consisted of a general assortment of drapery and haberdashery—there was stock in the counter-drawers—there was one or two nests of drawers in the shop which also contained stock—those goods would certainly not be seen in coming in but as shopman I had the opportunity of seeing their contests and I speak from that knowledge Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q How long have you been out of a situation A Three months—I have lived all that time at one place at the Cross Keys public-house Theobald s-road—I have lived there eight weeks—before that I lived in Berwick-street Soho—I was first applied to on this subject last Monday—I heard of the fire the day after it took place and saw in the papers that Mr Miers was apprehended on this charge—I saw the proceedings before the Magistrate Q Did you not immediately go and give information to somebody of what you knew about it A No I said nothing at all—I heard of the prosecution but not that I should be wanted—I had no application made to me until Monday—Mr Midgley then applied to me—I have seen him once or twice since then—I have seen Mr Jervis—I have not received any money for coming here—I was subpoenaed and received 1s with my subpoena—I do not know How much I am to receive—I have not had any conversation with Mr Midgley Mr Jervis or anybody about what I was to receive—Mr Miers s stock was removed from Oxford-street just previous to the 25th of March—I left about the middle of April I believe I cannot say on what day Q What wholesale houses did Mr Miers deal with in March or April A He dealt with Mr Walters in Wood-street—the others I do not know—there was a supply of what was necessary for the stock between the time of his removal from Oxford-street and April when I left—I do not know where it came from—I cannot swear to what extent goods were supplied then—I went to him again early in June and left at the latter past of June I believe—Mr Miers was ill when I went and I merely went till be was well again—I cannot tell the names of other wholesale houses from which he received goods during the month of May or June—I did not know that he was going to open a shop at Isleworth—I knew that Midgley was going to set up shop for himself—I have known Midgley for the last five years—I had not seen him for two years previous to going to live with Mr Miers in Oxford-street—I first knew him in 1833—I did not know his age—I heard he was under age—I have heard he was not above eighteen or nineteen Q Did you know that Mr Miers procured him credit by recommending him A I know nothing of that—since I have been out of a situation I have lived partly on the money I had when I was in a situation and partly by remittances from friends—the last house I was in was in Payne s in Exmouth-street Clerkenwell—I left them in December from illness—I saw Midgley last on Saturday MR THOMAS Q When you say Mr Miers s stock was worth from 2000l to 3000l do you mean the stock generally independent of any occasional supply A That was the general value of the stock—there was a warehouse besides the shop at the back part of the house—at the end of the time I was there there was a quantity of stock in that warehouse—I did not see any in a closet—I was not acquainted with toe upstairs part of the dwelling-house—not the whole of it—I have been over the house—I did not see the invoices when goods were sent—I had nothing to do with that WILLIAM JOHN WARREN I am a linen-draper and hate been so mole than twelve year I am not in business on my own account—I went to live with Mr Miers when he first opened his shop in Oxford-street in 1815—he left in March 1837—I was not with him the whole of that time—when I first went I should imagine the value of the stock was upwards of 3000l —I did not assist in the removal of his goods to High-street but remember his leaving Oxford-street perfectly well—I was living with him two or three days before he left—I should say the Value of his stock then was between 2000l and 3000l—I had opportunities of judging—I should suppose I am able to form an opinion of stock of that kind and formed that estimate a few days before he went to High-street Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q Are you now in any business A I am not—I have been out of a situation between two and three months—was with Mr Miers upwards of two years but I had left him for two or three months in that time and came back—he had five or six assistants generally besides himself in Oxford-street—sometimes more and sometimes less—he did a very good business there—I cannot give you any idea of the size of the shop—I have been in the shop in High-street but not to take Ha dimensions—I should say the shop in Oxford-street was decidedly the largest of he two—he dealt with Mr Walters while in Oxford-street—I do not recollect who else—he did not do much with Pawsons I think—I was not a buyer and had nothing to do with the invoices—I had 80l a-year and board and lodging Q Can you give me any idea How much per day or per week you took a Oxford-street over the counter A No—some days we took much more than others—I had nothing to do with taking the cash nor checking he cash and I cannot say—there was a cashier in the desk—he was some lad—I do not recollect his name—I have often lived in houses with lads and young men and did not know their names after being in the establishment two or three months Q You cannot tell me whether it was 10l of 50l a day or what A No I have known the time when we have taken 50l a day and more than that—I do not know that Saturday was a better day than others—he generally consider it a good day but for Oxford-street Monday it considered the best day—I cannot say whether I have known as much as or 80l taken in a day—I cannot say whether 50l would be a fair average—I had nothing to do with the books MR BALLANTINE Q You merely sold the articles which people came to ask for A If a customer came I was to make the best I could of of them—other people served in the shop—I do not remember Gattrell being in the service—the stock was made up in comparison with the sales—Mr Miers was in he habit of going into the City two or three times a week and always bought largely—I might have been engaged with a customer when goods came—I have on many occasions seen goods delivered from the City—there was a considerable sale of goods in the shop—we did I very good business—four or five assistants were required—if his sale was smaller of course less assistance would be required—the assistants were not to look after the stock but after the customers—if the sale was less but the stock as large the same assistance would not be required WILLIAM WALTERS re-examined by MR PAYNE I have my ledger here now—it was not kept by myself but by the clerk Glover—he left down Christmas—I have another ledger which was also kept by Glover—I have referred to the book since I was examined and turned the leaves down from April to December last year MR KELLY Q Cast your eyes over it I will give you the sums and you can tell me whether they substantially correspond— reads — Account from April 4th to May 18th 1837 would it be about 32l 9s 1d A Yes the would be near the amount some goods having been returned or it was have been 41l odd—from the 23rd of May to the 18th of July it was be exactly 15l 16s 2d and from the 8th of August to the 12th of september it would be 15l 15s 9d —from the 26th of September to the 12th of December it would be 18l 14s 2d and on the 2nd of January 3l 19s 10d —that is the last sum COURT Q Is the whole of that still due A No—the last pared of goods is due MR KELLY Q I think I see something about a bill returned a April 1838 A Yes—that is in my brother s handwriting-these good have all been paid for except those had from the 26th of December to the 2nd of January—part was paid on the 4th of January part on the 4th of November and part on the 4th of September—we had payments on the 4th of January this year—this bill was due on the 4th of April—it was drawn in January—it was only returned last week—the payment on the 4th of January was for the 15l parcel—the returned bill is for 13l 16s 6d —it was given for goods sold on the 26th of September and he make payment at the same time besides GEORGE SMITH I lodged in the prisoner s house in High-street Marylebone—I went there about the beginning of July or latter end of June—I occupied two rooms on the first floor a bed-room on the second and aback kitchen—I furnished the lodgings—they were let uufurnished—I left about the beginning of October—during the time I was there I complained on several occasions of the effluvia from the gas—I first complained of it within a day or two of my taking the apartments—I recollect the gas-fitter being sent for—I complained to Mr Miers immediately and he said he had sent—the gas-fitter came I that about a week after—that was Mr Defries—he did not come him self more than once—his man came afterwards two different times—I am quite sure it was three times in the whole—I am not certain whether it was remedied entirely—I cannot recollect—I do not recollect any smell at all from any escape of gas after the man had been—I do not remember complaining of any smell after that Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q When did the man come the last time A About the middle of September as near as I can say—I have not had any acquaintance with Mr Miers since I left his lodging—I think I was first applied to to become a witness this day week but I am not certain—I believe a clerk from Mr Jervis applied to me—Mr Genns applied to me a month ago—I understood you to mean when I was first applied to appear here—Mr Genna did not apply to me to come here—he asked me if I would come forward Q What made you leave the prisoner s lodging A I only took the lodging till I found a house to suit me—I was there altogether from there to four months—I had the first floor and a back room on the second floor—those rooms I furnished myself—I took my furniture away when I left—there was a shopman Mr Miers his wife a boy two servants and Mr Midgley in the house when I left—I believe Mr Midgley lived there while I was there but I am not sure of it—I think I have seen him there MR JAMES Q About Mr Genna s application to you he asked you to come forward on the trial A Yes and then I was subpoenaed WILLIAM WALTERS re-examined I have Midgley s account here This account being referred to was for goods supplied from the 8th of June to the 24th of June 1837 total amount 127l 10s 11d credit by returns 1l 13s 9d balance 125l 17s 2d GEORGE TILL I am an assistant to a draper and live with Mr Rout in Oxford-street I did live with Mr Miers as shopman in Oxford-street in June 1836—I did not go with him to High-street—I have been in his shop in High-street twice—I should think the first time was about five or six months ago—I observed the state of his shop at that time and it appeared very well stocked—I saw it again about a fortnight or three weeks after and it appeared the same—I have never been since—I could not form any notion of the value of the stock for I was not in the place five minutes Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q The last time you were there what month was it in A I really do not know—I cannot say whether it was in September October or August—I had some lace-goods to part with and called there to sell him some if I could—he was not within and I went out directly—I went on the same errand the time before and he was then up stairs unwell—I staid there about three minutes—I left directly I found he could not see me—I live now with Mr Rout of Oxford-street—it is not a large shop—he keeps ten or twelve assistants—Mr Miers kept four or five while I was with him—he had a very good trade while I was there—I cannot give any idea of the amount of the sales each day—it is some time ago—Mr Miers was up stairs unwell when I called in High-street—I cannot say whether he was in bed—I cannot tell whether that was in June—I cannot say it was not FREDERICK BOND I am a draper s assistant and live with Mr Clarke of Oxford-street I have lived with him since I left Mr Miers which was in March 1837 when he left Oxford-street—he took stock in August 1836—I cannot call to mind what the amount of stock was but Mr Rickards has the stock-book in his possession which is in my handwriting Q Whatever it was was the stock kept up to about the same amount up to the time of your leaving A I cannot say for a certainty but Mr Miers and other parties were in the City—I should say the amount of stock at the time he left was about the same because he was buying continually more or less—I should not say it was more Cross-examined by MR KELLT Q Can you tell at all what was the amount of his sales per day A No—no young man can tell you that because he had a cashier—I think his name was Barlow—I have not seen the cashier for this twelvemonth ROBERT MARKS I am a silversmith and carry on business at No 123 Oxford-street I know Midgley by name and since I have been here I recognise him as having purchased a child s coral of me with bells attached to it about nine or ten months back—I should most likely know it again for there was a private mark on it Cross-examined by Mr KELLY Q Perhaps when you were here you saw it on the table A No I did not—it was a coral with silver bells MR JAMES Q Did Midgley buy a wedding-ring of you A He did rather more than ten months ago—I think it was hardly so long as January 1837 but it may be EDWARD ANSTEAD I am clerk to Morley and Co of Gutter lane wholesale drapers They had business-transactions with Mr Miers—at the latter end of December last I called at his shop for the account and received the money from him—it was 4l 6s —I had previous to that been to his shop and received money—I was there on the 30th of November and received 23l 4s from him Q Did you on either of those occasions observe the general apperance of his shop as to the stock A I have no doubt I did but I have no very particular recollection about it—I had been in the habit of going there before—he dealt at our house from December 1835 up to January last—in the year 1837 he purchased at our house to the amount of 99l 19s 2d —the whole of that was after March—those goods were sent to High-street Marylebone—he owes us 6l 17s 10d now—all the rent has been paid—from the end of December 1835 to the end of 1836 he bought 322l 13s worth of goods—and on the 19th of January this year he purchased 1l 18s 10d worth MR KELLY Q Do you recollect what those goods were on the 19th of January A No—I did not deliver them—I am speaking from a journal DANIEL CLUTTRRBUCK I keep a coffee-house in Great Cattle-street Regent-street it is very near Oxford-market Castle-street east and west crosses Oxford-market—my shop is on the other side from John-street to Regent-street—there are very few houses from the market to John-street—I have kept my shop there nearly two years—I know a person named Midgley who sometimes used to come to my house—I have seen him to-day—he is the same man that used to come my shop—he on one occasion left a parcel at my house—I cannot recollect when it was—I should think it was about January but I really cannot say for I never dreamt of being asked the question—I perfectly recollect his calling and leaving a parcel—he had not left a parcel before—I believe he fetched it away the same evening—I am positive he had one parcel and I believe two—I did not know his name at that time—he might have known mine as it was on a brass plate on the door Cross-examined by MR KELLT Q What was written on the brass plate A Clutterbuck only—my house is on the north side of Oxford market—it is No 34—I call my address 34 Great Castle-street Regent-street —I have a board over the door stating it is a coffee and chop-house—I have kept it nearly two years—I cannot state positively when I first saw Midgley but I believe it was either in December or January—he came for refreshment—he did not give his name—I never heard him say who or what he was—I cannot say exactly that the parcel was left in January but I believe so Q When were you first applied to and asked any thing about the parcel A This morning never before—Midgley and the attorney s-clerk as I understood came to me—the clerk presented me with a summons and said he wanted me to come to the Old Bailey to give evidence respecting a parcel which Midgley had left at my house—he did not tell me when the parcel had been left nor about the time—they wanted me to go with them and they would go in a cab or omnibus—nobody lives at my shop but myself—there are lodgers but I have nothing to do with them —unstill this morning I did not know the name of Midgley—I never heard—I did not know what he was—there are several town-travellers come to my house from the City and carry brown paper parcels in their hands and the parcel he left was similar to those—it was larger than that book half as large again I should say—it was done up in brown paper—he merely asked permission to leave it for a while—he left it it might have been an hour or an hour and a half—I cannot tell to an hour—he fetched it away the same evening—I really cannot swear what month it was in—I do not six the time at all—it was certainly not February—town-travellers come for refreshments walk out leave their parcels and come back again and take them—that is a frequent practice—I do not know Mr Miers Q If I understand you you say parcels are left and the same person who leaves them comes and takes them away A Exactly so—I am not in the habit of receiving parcels directed for other people—if a traveller brings a parcel I would not give it up to anybody but himself—the practice is if a person does not wish to take a large parcel they leave it and tall for it again MR THOMAS Q Is it not very common for a person to leave a parcel of they wish to go any where A Yes—if I know the person I allow them to do so—I have not from that time to this seen anybody respecting my coming here—I have not seen Mr Jervis till to-day to my knowledge—nobody has applied to me before to-day—we take in newspapers at our shop—I recollect Miers being brought before Mr Rawlinson—that will not bring the time to my recollection—it was before that I am certain—I have no motive whatever in coming here to-day—I am positive Midgley is the person who left the parcel COURT Q Do you know the coffee-shop kept by Higgins A I know several in the neighbourhood—I do not know the man himself—I do not recollect the name—I do not know Wood s coffee-shop—my shop is a very short distance from No 13 John-street—I should say within 100 yards—do not know No 118 Great Titchfield-street—I know Great Titchfield-street—I do not know the coffee-shop kept by Wood there—I do not know which way the numbers run—the part of Titchfield-street nearest to my house is at the top of the market where the street begins—the north side of the market—I should say the beginning of Great Titchfield-street is 300 yards from my shop—the market is about half the distance JOSEPH SMITH I am a plumber painter and glazier and carry on business in Woodstock-street Oxford-street I was employed in August 1837 to paint and varnish the front of Mr Miers s house—that was the last I did to it—I have not received orders to do anything since that time but in August I received orders to compo or repair the front and put up Mr Miers s name but I did not do it in consequence of the weather the compo not being dry enough to paint—it has never been done—the last time I was in the prisoner s shop was on the 10th of November—I merely went there to order some goods to be sent to my house and he said he wished as soon as the compo was ready I would finish it and put up the name—I told him the compo was not dry enough and I did not do it—I did not see him about any thing after that—I was never in the shop after the 10th of November—the goods I ordered then were sent home—I cannot recollect what they were—I have dealt with Mr Miers some time and have been in his shop several times—I painted it in March 1837 before he moved into it and I did something again to it is August Q From the view you made of the shop in August what was your opinion of the stock A I am not a judge of linen-drapery—the shop appeared as well stocked then as it was when it was opened—I did not notice any alteration or diminution Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q How long were you in the shop in August A I painted the outside—there was nothing to call my attention to the stock—I cannot say what my bill was—I painted the outside in March three or four times over and finished it in August—in August I gave it a coat of paint and varnished it—I made two charges for it no one charge for the whole—the last charge was between 2l and 3l I suppose Q What is this about the compo A When he took the house there was a name with the letters projecting—he wished them cut away from the compo and filled in and then when dry his own name put up—that was in August—I employed a man to do it but the work was not dry enough—Mr Miers applied to me in November to finish the work when I went to his house to order goods and he sent to my house once afterwards for me to paint it which I did not do in consequence of the weather—the letters were filled up in August Mr JAMES Q In November was it Mr Miers spoke to you about it or you to him A Mr Miers spoke to me—leaving it unfinished in November was my neglect—in fact it was not dry enough to paint Mr KELLY Q When were you called on to come here A On Tuesday last THOMAS COLLINE BENNETT I am in the house of Caldecott and Co at Cheapside Mr Miers was in the habit of dealing with them since october 1835—he opened his account then—I have a statement here a two bills which he accepted for goods—I cannot tell what amount of goods were supplied but those bills were accepted for the goods—there was a bill he paid on the 4th of April 1837 of 36l 18s and on the 26th of April there was paid with cash 12l 11s 6d —there was no more in 1837—We have no transactions after that but several previous—I cannot tell what goods were sold in 1837—the paper I have is merely an account of bills paid us Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q Can you undertake to say of your own knowledge that any goods at all were supplied to him by your house after February the 17th 1837 I am not asking about bills because they might be for past debts A Yes the bills were for past debts—I should think so—I do not know of goods being supplied after the 17th of February 1837 but I could inform you if I had the books Q Do you know whether the goods in the former years were supplied under a guarantee which was withdrawn in 1837 A The goods was supplied under a guarantee—I cannot say when it was withdrawn—I know when the account commenced we had a guarantee JAMES SEBASTIAN YATES I am in the house of Coster and Co silk merchants and general warehousemen in Aldermanbury Mr Miers dealt with them—I cannot say when he began but I think it was in 1835—he continued dealing with them down to the time of his premises being burnt down—I cannot tell without referring to books to what amount he dealt with us during the year 1837 nor in any other year—I believe a statement of the account has been given which you can refer to— looking at a paper — this is not my writing—I do not be five it is the writing of any one in our house—there are two partners in our firm at this time—a copy of the account has been furnished and if that is in Court I can swear to its being a copy of the ledger—it was given both on behalf of the Insurance-office and of the prisoner—I examined it from the books myself Q Look at this statement and tell us How much you supplied in 1835 A About 369l MR KELLY Q I find I have a copy of the account furnished to the insurance Office it begins in October 1835 A Yes—the amount in October and part of November is 316l odd—the amount of goods kept was 245l 15s 2d —the whole amount supplied in 1835 is 369l deducting the returns—in 1836 it was about 740l and down to March 25th 1837 it was 22l —and from Lady-day up to January 1838 it was 260l —those were the last goods sold MR THOMAS Q In speaking of those amounts do you account for my goods returned in speaking of the 740l A That is independent of the goods returned—we have been paid for every thing except the last goods which were sold in December 1837 and January 1838—the amount of the last supply in December and January was 36l odd—7l in January and 19l In December—those goods should have been paid for on the last Thursday in January—that was after the fire—there has been no failure of payment whatever when due MR KELLY Q Do you know that your house down to the time of his leaving Oxford-street supplied him with these goods under a guarantee A They did—that guarantee was withdrawn in April 1837 and after that are supplied him with goods from one month to the other he paying for each month—we did not extend our credit beyond one month s account—the amounts go on diminishing after July and August—the amount in August was the largest after March—but after that time they go on diminishing will we come down to January MR THOMAS Q Do you consider High-street as good a situation for the sale of goods as Oxford-street A I should say for a lower class of goods MR KELLY Q Do you know Midgley A We do not—I believe Midgley wished us to supply him with goods—I know from the people in the house that a 410l bill was offered—I do not know it myself MR THOMAS Q Did you offer yourself to do business with Mr Miers in the way stated—to give him a month s credit A We did MR KELLY Q Is this your invoice for the last goods A Yes—we usually deal for a bill at three months from the first of the following month but when the guarantee was withdrawn we agreed to let him have credit to the end of the month MR THOMAS Q Do you allow discount for those sort of dealings A Yes one and a quarter per cent —RAND I am clerk in the warehouse of Messrs Bradbury wholesale mercers No 6 Aldermanbury I recollect Mr Mien dealing at our house—he commenced in December 1835—I have extracts here from our books—he dealt with us up to the 12th of April 1837—the last supply was in April except a single parcel which was paid for on delivery—we did not send any goods to High-street—I cannot tell exactly the amount of goods furnished during 1837—I should imagine the gross amount was 137l Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q Do not tell us what you imagine A I have no dates—I should say goods were supplied to a greater amount than 30l or 40l In 1837 I should say it was to the amount of 150l is 1837 but I cannot tell until I see our books again MR JAMES Q What is the extract you have from your books there A Bills drawn and paid WILLIAM HOPKINS HOLYLAND re-examined I am clerk to Messers Pawson and Co This account— looking at one —was furnished from our house and I believe it to be correct—we did not supply any goods to Mr Miers in 1837—our account only comes up to December 9th 1836—the whole amount of goods supplied was 1790l —it began October 2 1835—between that and December 1836 there was 1790l worth of goods supplied but nothing at all since that—we were paid for the goods Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q Ton said before that they were supplied under a guarantee which has been since withdrawn A Yes we have had no dealings with him since—nearly half that amount was in 1835 and the other half in 1836 T C BENNETT re-examined I have now brought a copy of the ledger—the account commences on the 7th of October 1835—the whole amount in 1835 is 350l but part of those goods were returned between 6l and 7l worth which would make it about 343l —in 1836 it amounted to about 960l and in 1837 to about 12l —the last date of 1837 is the 17th of February Cross-examined by MR KELLY Q Do you know anything of this of your own knowledge or have you taken it from your books A I have taken it from the ledger—he returned goods to the amount of 7l —3l 10s and 1l 9s 3d was all that was supplied in 1837—I cannot say whether the returns are deducted from that amount—it is a very rough statement—I think about 326l worth were supplied subsequent to the 31st of August 1836—we always supplied the goods under a guarantee—I was withdrawn in April I think John Manning mercer and draper

and then she took possession and carried on the business Cross-examined by MR CROUCH Q Who do you say are the trustees A John Holborrow and two others—Mrs Pettigrew and her husband have occupied it many years—I have received the rent for eight or ten years—both the prisoners came to me concerning the distress before it was put in—Pettigrew stated that if I would wait some time she would pay the

employ of Mr Garner a broker and auctioneer—I was put in possession of the house No 21 Old-street—I have the warrant here—I went in possession on the 6th of April—there are six rooms in the house—Pettigrew was not there on the 6th of April nor on the 7th but she came and slept there on the 8th and till the 15th in the back parlour down stairs—Joblyns and her daughter came to see Pettigrew in the day-time—on the 16th of April Joblyns came there—she and Pettigrew who is her mother went out about twelve—they said they were going to Doctors Commons and Joblyns grumbled because Pettigrew was not ready—they left Joblyns daughter in the house—she remained in the shop and so did I till Joblyns and Pettigrew came back between two and three—they had some bread and cheese and a pint of beer in the shop— the granddaughter went away leaving them in the shop —Pettigrew then went up stairs alone and remained there for about an hour—Joblyns was down stairs in the shop—Joblyns and Pettigrew went out a second time between four and five saying they were going to their friend Mr Sharp s to tea—Joblyns returned about eight or a little after—she sat down and conversed a little time in the shop—she then said I wonder what mother has been up stairs for she has not been up stairs for months if you will allow me the candle I will go and see —I said certainly she might take it—she took the candle off the table and went up stairs with it—she was not away to my recollection more than five minutes—she brought down the candle with her and put it on the table—she said the old lady bad been up stairs doing something to the bed—she stated that the old lady was taken violently ill where they went round to tea that she was obliged to have a doctor and a physician and put her feet into warm water—Joblyns went away and said if her son should call she should not be long before she was back—I said it was a very great pity that the old lady was taken so ill and I supposed she would not be able to be left alone—she said she supposed she should have to be up with her all night—I said Very well I will take care of everything the same as if you were here you know I can t leave the possession of the house you will find the shop open and everything right when you come in the morning —she left and came back about half-past nine or rather better and asked if her son had been—I generally go to bed about ten but that night I did not go to bed before eleven as she told me the old lady might take it into her head to return as old people were so curious in their way I had better wait half-an-hour longer—she did not go up stairs then but left the house a little before ten and did not return any more that night—I stood at the door till about eleven—I then bolted the door and went up stairs to go to bed—when I got up stairs on the landing I found a smoke and smother as if it was the smell of wood but I could not say exactly—I went into the first floor back room which is a bed-room that was more full of smoke than the landing was—I was not able to discover any fire there—I then went to the second floor back room—it was still full of smoke all the way up stairs and so it was when I got to the top—I came down and looked into the first floor back room again—I went down into the parlour—I could find no fire or make or any signs of any fire there—I then went up stairs on the landing again as I thought it might proceed from the next house—I came down and went to the next house and asked if the chimney was on fire—Sarah Drake came from the next door and ran up stairs before me—I followed her with a candle—she saw the fire through the glass door or something—she opened the door of the first floor room and said Here it is here it is —I saw a smoke but I did not see the fire—I went down stairs to get Mr Drake—he and I went up stairs together—I then saw the fire in the floor of the front room—it was all of a red fire but not blazing out—Mr Drake begged me to go down and keep the door fast which I did—he threw some water on the fire and went and got another pail of water threw that on and another person brought a pail of water—they succeeded in extinguishing the fire—after Drake had put it out some policemen and firemen came—I cannot say which of them came first—the policeman examined the room—I saw him hold his lantern or candle to the hole in the floor and there I saw some lucifers—there were three or four holes—one was towards the partition on one side of the fire and two or three on the other side next to the window—one on the landing—there were lucifers in each hole and some papers and wood in one hole which the policeman took possession of—on the day before I had bought a box of lucifers which I put on the table in the shop and some time in the course of the 16th I missed some of the lucifers—no person besides myself and the prisoners had been up stairs that day COURT Q You told Joblyns you could not leave the house A Yes—I said she might go and stop with the old lady the things would be perfectly safe as I could not leave the house—I am sure I said so Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q It was about eight o clock when Joblyns came back A Yes—she went up stairs after she had been there a while between eight and nine—I may have said it was nearer eight than nine—it was between the two hours—it was about half-past nine when she came back about her son—she did not go up stairs then—she left me before ten—it was about eleven when I went up stairs to bed—I had shut up the shop about eight and then I stood at the door or sat down in the shop but nothing attracted my attention till I went up stairs—I persist in swearing that there was smoke on the first landing—it was not so dense as it was when I opened the back room door—when I got into the back room it was very dense—the landing is rather a large one—I looked about in the back bed-room I could not see any fire—I went up stairs and looked into the back bed-room there—I did not look in the front room as there was no furniture or anything there but I thought there might be a spark fell on the bed things in the back rooms—in the first floor front room there was an old bureau and bookcase—at the top were two tables and four chairs—in the back room first floor were a bedstead mattress and bedding a table two old chairs and I think a wash-tub—they were all old and worth very little—I was told that some goods were removed a fortnight before—I slept in the second floor back and had a flock bed—the daughter and mother slept in the first floor back room when they did sleep there—all the other rooms were unoccupied—there was but a little stock in the shop—I did not look into the first floor front room at all because I thought nothing could catch fire there—the top of the house was shut up—there is no trap-door that I could perceive—there were some windows but I believe they were all shut—when I went out to Drake s fur water I pulled the street door to in my flurry—I did not put the fire out Mr Drake did—it is an old house—the floor was very dry and there were holes in it—the hole in the landing was the same as those in the floor—they appeared to be holes worn—I am in the habit of smoking at times—I had not been looking out of the first floor window at all that day I am sure of that—I went up stairs but not with a pipe—I never smoked up stairs—I do not know whether there had been any disputing between Pettigrew and her landlord besides this distress COURT Q These holes in the floor did not appear to be made fresh A No I believe they were old SARAH DRAKE I live next door to this house Eyre came in and I went with him into the next house—I have heard what he said about finding this fire Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q When you went up you saw the fire with the greatest ease A Not till I went up to the door but I had no candle—I did not perceive any smoke on the landing but when the room door was opened there was great smoke from the bit of board that was alight—my father did not come while I was there—I went down and Mr Eyre followed me HUGH JAMES DRAKE I went into the house—I observed that there was a dense smoke in the passage so much so that I was obliged to stoop—I had no candle—I went into the front room on the first floor—the smoke there was Very dense and there was a fire behind the door—I found the smoke so dense when I got to about the middle of the passage that I crawled on my hands and knees to the fire—I saw a red fire about two feet square in the floor—I crawled close to it and perceived there were little lights round the joists in the floor and the whole of the floor appeared to be destroyed as far as the joists went—I looked into the hole and put my hand in—there was something which was very hot and very hard—I got out of the room as quickly as I could and knowing there was no water in the house I went to my own house took the tub of water off my counter went into the house and knowing where the fire was I stooped down with the tub in my hands and poured the water into the hole and then the smoke was very bad—I opened the window and called out for more water—I succeeded in putting out the fire—I do not think the water I took would have extinguished it if there had not been more water brought—I sent for my axe and broke in the flooring and discovered a great deal of sand and that I suppose was the hard substance that I felt—I did not remove any boards till the firemen and policemen came—I then removed the boards and saw these lucifer matches—the policemen picked them up—they were on fire on the other side of the joists under the floor—I observed more holes than one in the floor Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Have you been in the house since A Yes two or three times—there is a padlock on the outside HENRY ANDREW MALLETT I am an engineer of the Whitecross-street fire station On the night in question I was called by the policeman to the house in Old-street-road—I found the fire was extinguished in the first floor front room—the flooring and joists were burned Cross-examined Q This was an old flooring A Yes—I understand there has been a new flooring since HENRY WILLIAM DUBOIS police-sergeant N 14 On the night of the 16th of April I went to the house No 21 Old-street-road which is in the parish of St Leonard s Shoreditch—I went into the first floor front room—I saw a hole in the flooring about two feet from the stove where about eighteen inches or two feet had been burnt quite away no portion of the flooring remaining—after the firemen went away I went down into the shop and on the counter I saw a great quantity of mortar and sand where the hole had been broken through in the ceiling and a small portion of tinder of rags in the mortar and sand that had fallen through where the hole had been broken—I went up stairs after that to the room where the fire had taken place and saw a hole in this board which I produce—this board was near to where the fire had been burning next to the joists that were burnt and in the hole in this board I could see matches paper and chips—I found another hole in the floor where there had been a knot in the wood and in that hole I found this other paper and these matches—I could see them the very moment I turned my light on—on searching the floor further I saw another hole near the window and in that hole I found this other piece of paper—on searching the landing leading to the room which had been on fire I saw another hole and in that I found some lucifer matches and a paper which is a receipt—I examined the whole house but did not find anything but in that room and landing—next morning I went to No 6 Wenlock-cottages and there I saw Joblyns—she called to me while I was on the stairs—I told her to put on her clothes and go along with me to her house in Old-street-road which had been on fire—she said O dear O dear me what shall I do my mother is so ill I cannot leave the house —I said You must go with me —she said What damage is done is the house burnt down —I said You must go with me and see —she said Is the man hurt or burnt —I said He is not no thanks to you —on the 18th I received this policy of

given a correct account of it—I produce some lucifers which I found at the house—I went to Wenlock-cottages the next morning—I got there first—I saw Joblyns and asked for Mrs Pettigrew—Joblyns said her name was Joblyns and wanted to know my business saying her mother was very ill—I asked if she knew that their house in Old-street-road was on fire—she said O dear me fire What a sad thing it is for we are not insured or something to that effect—Sergeant Dubois then came up—I had seen some goods removed for No 21 Old-street about ten or eleven days before—there was a cart at the door and Joblyns and a man were helping to put the goods into the cart Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Can you swear it was not twelve or fourteen days before A It might have been WILLIAM CALDWELL I am a

Leonard William Nottage and Thomas Lewis MESSRS DOANE and WILDE conducted the Prosecution SARAH LEONARD I am the wife of George Leonard a smith and farrier of No 1 Bridge-row Hammersmith On Sunday evening the 8th of Feb about seven o clock my attention was called to a very strong smell of fire in the passage leading to the prisoners house No 3 Bridge-row in the parish of Hammersmith—I had seen the elder Stone pass our house about half-past five o clock in the evening coming in a direction from the house of Catchpole which is about five minutes walk from the prisoner s house—he passed our window going ia a direction for his own house but I did not see him go into it GEORGE LEONARD I am the witness s husband—I let the house No 3 Bridge-row to the elder Stone I think in June last at 15l a year at a quarterly tenant—Mrs Hyde came into the house first and Stone sen about a month after—they lived together as man and wife—Stone jun hat not been there long—he came a little before Christmas—in Nov last Stone sen came to my shop and asked if I was insured and where I am not certain about the time —I told him yes—he asked if Carter who was a tenant of mine was insured—I said yes that I insured with Mr Austin who is agent to the Union and said Carter was insured in the same office—he left me saying he would go over and tee about insuring—he came back and said he had been to make inquiry and asked me to let him see a paper connected with insurance—the prisoners all three lived at the house up to the beginning of Feb —I saw them occasionally going in and out—I was at a friend s house on Sunday night the 8th of Feb when there was an alarm of fire—I went to the prisoners house—I live next door—I got there a little after eight o clock and observed smoke coming from the up-stair window—the house is only one story high—I tried to get in at the window but it was fast—I at last broke the front door open—there was to much smoke coming from the window we did not get in or we should have been suffocated—I went through a little shop which the front door opens into to get up stairs—I at last got to the top but was suffocated with smoke and fell down against the person behind me—when I recovered I knelt on the floor and saw the bed was on fire—there was an old bedstead and the bed which was on it was on fire—it was a sort of bag of shavings—it was a common bag of cooper s shavings and tome tow mixed with them on the ticking—I pulled the bag down stairs into the road—I went up to the room again and when the air got in the partition of the room and the bedstead began to blaze—the wooden partition was fixed to the house—I had some difficulty in getting the fire out—if I had not had plenty of water I should never have done it—we saw smoke coming out of a box under the bedstead—the lid was closed and smoke coming out where it shuts down—there Was no sign of fire outside the box—we opened it and found in it a lot of cooper s chips and a bag of chips and shavings and a large piece of coke or cinder about us big us my fist in the middle of the bag—it appeared to have been put into the bag to set it on fire—the bag had a hole cut in it and the coke put in—it was burning—there was no fire-place in that room—I thought the box when opened smelled very strongly of turpentine—I think there was also a clothes-horse one chair a tub and I believe a horn lantern in that room—we saw fire through the chinks of the partition in the other room which were made by being burned—I burst a piece out of the pannel with my feet so that we could get water through and found fire was underneath the floor—we got it out—it appeared as if a piece of the floor had been taken up and a lot of old baskets chips and cinders put in that was burning underneath the floor—there was an old-fashioned tent bedstead in that room and a piece of old white curtain over the top of it of no value—the place was so full of smoke we could not get into that room—I ran down stairs to my own house and by bursting open two doors I got into the room—I found a bag on the bed there filled with shavings like the other and it was all in a blaze—there was no bedding in that bed nor any ticking—the bag rested on the sacking—there was a chest of painted deal drawers in that room—we observed smoke coming from the bottom drawer and on opening it it contained a lot of cooper s chips and cinders lying along the middle as if thrown in with a fire-shovel—the chips were burning—I saw no cinders on the floor but in the drawer which was itself on fire—there was a stove in that room but no remains of fire—I put my hand to the stove and it was quite cold—there were five drawers to the chest—we opened them and the one above the bottom one was strewed with cooper s chips which were in every drawer—I found three or four bags of shavings altogether one in each bed one in the box and another under the second bed which was not on fire—I think there was one chair in the back room and a washhand-stand—there was no furniture up stairs but two bedsteads a washhand-stand a chest of drawers and two chairs—they sold sweetmeats in the shop and we found some in the shop—the whole stock I should think was not worth 5s —the officer Jupp came to my assistance and he found a policy of insurance in the drawer which was on fire—Sergeant Mount afterwards produced a key which I knew to be the key of the street-door I had given to Stone when he took the house HENRY LEE I accompanied Mr Leonard to this house—I saw sacks full of shavings—I took the box from under the bed and opened it—it was not on fire outside—I found a bag in it pulled it out and was in the act of pulling the other out but it came open and out came a large piece of coal or cinder—it had been burning—I gave it to the policeman—the partition was on fire and the floor of the other room—I saw the drawers full of cooper s chips—the bottom drawer was on fire and an old rag or waistcoat in it also some coals or cinders ELIZA DOWST I am the wife of John Dowst and live in Wiltshire the female prisoner is my aunt About Christmas I came to Bridge-row to live with them—two of the prisoners lived there and the other slept at the house—I slept up stairs in one of the rooms on a feather bed—there were blankets sheets a counterpane and four or five chairs in the room a chest of drawers looking-glass carpet and curtains—the next room was a bed-room—young Stone slept there—there was a bed there one chair or two and as far as I know a proper supply of bedding blankets and sheets for him—I went into the room—it had bed-clothes and there was a carpet to the room and a box under the bed no drawers nor washhand-stand—I continued to lodge with them there for three weeks till about a week before the fire—at that time Stone senior told me it was not convenient for me to stay there—I made up my mind to go back to Wilts—I Packed up my things next day and while doing so Stone begged me not to go and so did my aunt—they asked me to go and take a house they would pay the rent and all expences and find things for my use—I consented and went with my aunt and took a house in Trafalgar-street about a quarter of a mile from Bridge-row Hammersmith—I took possession of the house on the Saturday following a week before the fire—I lived there by myself for about a week—Richard Beck brought things to this house three or four times—the first time he brought a bed which they sent for me—he also brought a bedstead two boxes and a set of fire-irons no chairs were brought—I had never seen the fire-irons at Bridge-row—some time after these things came Stone senior came and told me the bedstead should be put up on the ground floor—he said it was not worth while to lug it up stain perhaps I might not be there long—I made no answer but paused on that a good deal—I cannot tell whether I saw him the next day or not—he asked how I got on—I said I was very unhappy about what to do—he said I was to make myself contented for a bit he was working all things together for the best—this was three or four days before the fire—on the Sunday evening 9th of Feb my aunt and young Stone called on me in Trafalgar-street and I observed my aunt putting something under the bed—she had a cloak on and appeared to have something bulky under it—she said nothing about it then—she afterwards called me outside the door and said Stone had been very cross and contrary he was on the drinking order that he had been grumbling because he was so dirty and she had brought his dirty clothes down and on the morrow she would come and they should be washed—we went into the room again—young Stone was there— it was the room below —she said if he was told they were going to be washed he would want them but he should not have them till they were clean—I asked where the was going—she said she was going to meet Stone—this was in the evening after tea and it was candle-light—I asked her where—she said at Turnhamgreen and that he was gone to receive a little money that was owing him—I think this was about seven o clock—I then went with her and young Stone to Turnham-green—I did not know where I was going—we all three went into a beershop kept by Mrs Phillips—my aunt called for a pot of beer—she appeared to be very low—I asked her what was the matter—she shook her head—I asked if she was afraid Stone would not come—she said he was sure to come—my son was in our company then—I and my son left leaving young Stone and my aunt in the beer-shop—as we came out we met Stone senior going in—he said Halloo won t you go in and have anything to drink —I think this must have been about eight or after eight o clock—we declined going in and went home to Trafalgar-street—soon after we got there Newell and some other persons knocked at the door and I heard Stone s house was on fire—I had not then got back many minutes—I gave information of Stone being at the beer-shop—I went to the house in Bridge-row and saw as I thought a bed thrown out but somebody said it was shavings—in consequence of what happened I looked under my bed where my aunt had put something and found a bundle and a bandbox—the bundle contained dirty clothes a cord jacket trowsers and waistcoat—the trowsers and waistcoat wanted washing but not the jacket the bandbox contained dirty cap a woman s apron and a gown—about twelve o clock that night as near as I can recollect my aunt came and knocked at my door—I said nothing to her—she said to me Why do you look so scornful at me —I said Dear me aunt I don t know what you are up to you are bringing trouble on yourselves and me as well —she made no answer but went and laid herself down on the bed and appeared to be in a great deal of trouble but said nothing—she remained till next morning when the police-sergeant took her in charge Stone sen Q Was not what I told you that it was not convenient for us three to be sleeping together I was not going to be turned out of my bed for you A My aunt and I slept together—sometimes Stone would come in after I was gone to bed—I asked why he sent for me when he said I could not stop longer Stone I told you to go back home Witness Oh no you begged me to stop and not return to Wilts RICHARD BECK I am the son of Charles Beck who keeps a beer-shop in Queen s-lane Hammersmith—on the 7th of Feb Mrs Dowst applied to me to move some furniture—I removed three or four boxes and a feather-bed on Saturday afternoon to Trafalgar-street—she gave them to me out of my father s stable which is behind the prisoner s house in Bridge-row quite close to it—there was a bedstead in the stable which I removed afterwards—that had been in the stable a long time—I moved it the same afternoon but after the other things—I did not move anything else from the stable but I moved out of Stone s house a basket containing something a tub and pan—it was the same day the 7th—I took them to 7 Trafalgar-street—Mrs Dowst was there to take them in—I saw Stone sen and the female prisoner at Bridge-row when I brought them away—I took the boxes first out of the stable—I afterwards removed a basket pail a bedstead and bed in a cart—I took two bedsteads to Trafalgar-street in all the boxes were different sizes and wooden—all the things we took from Bridge-row were directed to Mrs Dowst to be left at Mr Stone s near the Broadway Hammersmith CHARLES BECK I am the father of Richard Beck—I have a stable at the back of No 3 Bridge-row—I knew Stone sen —I had an old bedstead in my stable for three or four weeks before the fire—on the Sunday of the fire I went into the prisoner s shop for 1d worth of nuts some time after two o clock I saw all three of the prisoners in the house—I live next door to them—young Stone brought me a quart pot which they had of mine that evening between the lights—he said Mr Beck here is your pot DANIEL MERRITT I am a modeller and builder and reside at No 4 Waterloo-street Hammersmith—I am landlord of a house in Trafalgar-street—the female prisoner came to me about that house with the witness Dowst—I let the house to the two persons—they left 1s deposit—Mrs Dowst took possession of the house on Friday the 30th of Jan —she brought a few things with her—Stone sen came to the house the same day with the female prisoner—they had something wrapped in a handkerchief—I afterwards saw Stone sen leave the house with a quart pot in his hand—he took the key of the street-door with him WILLIAM NEWELL I am a shoemaker—on the 8th Feb I went to Bridge-row Hammersmith about nine o clock—I went to No 7 Trafalgar-street and saw the witness Dowst—I made inquiries after the prisoners—I afterwards went to Phillips s beer-shop and found the three prisoners there—Stone and his son were smoking and they were drinking—Horness accompanied me—we called Stone sen aside and told him his place was on fire—he said Oh is it —we said Yes —he kept smoking his pipe and asked if we would have a drop of ale—we said Yes and followed him in and he gave us some—when we got inside the female prisoner asked Stone what was the matter—he said the place was on fire—she began to cry—they staid to finish their ale and we all came out together and when we got a little way Stone said he had been to Brentford that the younger prisoner and the female came to meet him at Phillips s at Turnham-green—he asked the female prisoner if she had left any fire up stairs—she said yes she had left a small bit of fire to air the things which were round it—she said she had left one fire up stairs and one down stairs a small one—we came along and told them they had broken the doors open we did not say who and got some drawers open and got some papers which they were reading of—Stone sen then said he was done—I did not describe the papers—I had not seen them—we accompanied him all the way to the house—we left the female behind and brought Stone sen up to the door of the house where Mount the policeman took him HENRY MOUNT I am Serjeant of the police—on the 8th of Feb I went to Leonard s premises No 3 Bridge-row—I produce the drawers and things which were set on fire—here is the lower drawer which had fire in it—the bottom of the next drawer was burnt but had no fire in it only chips and shavings—here is the box—I found Leonard and Lee there—they had extinguished the fire—I saw the partition and flooring burnt—Newell afterwards came up with Stone sen and I took him into custody—he then said he had been to Brentford—I asked him what part—he said he did not know—he afterwards said on the way to the station that he was asleep in the chair and did not know whether he was the last who left the house or not—I said Very well the one who left last we shall know because they have got the key —after proceeding about twenty yards further I heard something jink over the wall—I said What is that —he said Aye —I asked again and he made do answer—I went on to the station-house searched him and took from his pocket an inventory of some furniture wrapped in a piece of paper—he attempted to destroy it—another constable prevented him—it took two of us to hold him to get it from him—next morning I went to the wall where I heard the jink and found a key which I tried to the house-door and it fits it—it has three notches on it—I showed it to the landlord—I found at the house in Trafalgar-street two inventories of things with the prices against them—I saw Dowst at that house afterwards—I found some boxes locked up in that house—I examined them and found they contained a variety of wearing apparel linen candlesticks and different household articles—there was a bedstead there and two beds—there was salt-cellars mantle-ornaments pictures and a quantity of linen of different descriptions in the boxes—the female prisoner was present and saw me take the papers and snatched them from my hand—they were in a box which was locked—I could not find the key and could not get it open—she said at first it did not belong to her—I said Then I must get a key for I am determined to look into it —she then produced the key—I found the papers in that box and she snatched them from me—I got them from her and produce them—Stone jun came in while I was there—I found this paper on Stone sen —— this being read was an inventory of sundry articles of furniture and wearing apparel —this other paper was found in the box— this was a printed memorandum of Stone sen having proposed an insurance in the Union Office on 100l and paid 5s deposit dated 19th of May 1845 but unless the remainder of the premium was paid within twenty-one days to be void The other papers were a list of articles of furniture and clothing with the value amounting together to 84l 10s another list of articles without any value and not corresponding with the former also another paper dated the 9th of Dec 1845 being a list of clothing and linen Witness Here is an inventory of things found at Trafalgar-street and the total value I put on them is 9l 10s 6d —being a cabinet-maker by trade that is the value I should like to give for them—I found in the house after the fire a painted bedstead three chairs a washhand-stand a jug and ewer a bonnet-box a deal box containing the chips and a painted chest of drawers—they Were in one room—I value them at 1l 7s 6d —they were very inferior articles—in another room was a clothes-basket an old coat trowsers and waistcoat two tubs a lantern a blanket clothes-horse quilt and one bedstead—I value them at 13s 1d —in the third room down stairs were two chairs two tables a hearth-rug eight dishes eight plates one tea-tray one brush one frying-pan a saucepan thirteen show-glasses a bread-tray and knife-box—I value them at 1l 4s 2d —the total value 3l 3s —that is all I found—I perceived a smell of turpentine on some of the articles and found a waistcoat very strongly saturated with it and a bag—I found a bottle which had contained turpentine by the side of the bed in one of the up-stair rooms—the turpentine which is now on this inventory was not apparent when I found it JOSEPH CHUBB policeman I accompanied Leonard and Lee to the house—I found chips burning and the bags which have been produced—in the bottom drawer which had chips in it I found this policy of insurance—I found all these papers there together— these were a proposal for an insurance against fire also a proposal for a life insurance GEORGE CATCHPOLE I am a cooper and live at Hammersmith About a month before the fire I sold some chips to Stone sen —I took them to his shop door—they were such as have been produced—they came to 6d —I saw him about half-past three or four o clock in the afternoon on the day of the fire—he continued with me about twenty minutes—I was ill at the time—he came for a pint of beer or something and came up and saw me—he went away about half-past five—our house is about 150 yards from his WILLIAM CARTER I am a printer and live at No 2 Bridge-row Hammersmith I know Stone sen —I assisted the female prisoner to unload the furniture when it was brought in—I saw some furniture in Trafalgar-street—I cannot say whether it was the same—the drawers produced resemble those I helped her move in—the furniture at Trafalgar-street very much resembled what I helped to unload in Bridge-row SOLOMON AUSTIN I am agent at Hammersmith for the Union Insurance I delivered this policy to Stone sen in Oct 1845—these two papers are proposals for a fire and life insurance—I gave them both to him in Oct —this memorandum was given him on the 19th of Aug

t18470510-1304  1304 JONH HOBBS THOMAS FREDERICK WEBSTER and ROBERT LEWER were indicted for feloniously setting fire to a stack of hay the property of Frederick Piggott and that Webster had been before convicted of felony MR ROBINSON conducted the Prosecution FREDRICK PIGGOTT I am an estate agent and have a farm in the kew-road in the parish of Richmond At the back of that farm I had a hay-rick sixty or seventy yards from the high-road—on the 23rd of April at a quarter to eight o clock n the evening I went round it and saw it safe—at half-past eight or a quarter to nine I received information which induced me to go to it again—I found it on fire it was in a blaze all the way round—there were some faggots under it burning—it had been laid on faggots—with the assistance of some of my neighbours I extinguished the fire—the faggots were burnt—it is impossible that combustion could be the cause of it because it was old hay—I know nothing of the prisoners HENRY UPTON policeman On the night of the 23rd of April I was on duty in the Kew-road on the Richmond side of Mr Piggott s hay-rick about 200 yards from it—about five minutes after eight o clock in the evening and met the three prisoners going towards the premises about 200 yards from the place—when they saw me they made a stop—two of then looked round and crossed over the road—the rick was safe when I had passed it—in about twenty minutes I saw it on fire SAMUEL WINLET I am a market-gardener and live at Richmond On the night of the 23rd of April a little after half-past eight o clock in the evening I saw the prisoners in Sandy-lane—Mr Piggott s meadow joins the lane—they were coming as if from the hay-rick—they were n the lane when I first saw them—at the time I saw them I noticed the hay-rick—it was on fire—they had their backs towards it—they asked me if there was an engine kept in the parish—I said yes there was—they came towards the cross road towards Richmond—I went towards the rick—in going from Sandy-lane into Kew-road they would not have to cross the meadow where the stack was not where I met them but in getting from Kew-road to Sandy-lane they would—I had seen them at half-past two o clock the same afternoon walking from Sandy-lane—they asked me where that road led them to—I know nothing about them Prisoner Webster Q When we met you in the afternoon did we speak to you A You asked where the road led I said To Richmond and you went that way—you were in company with the other prisoners KINGSTON MARK police-sergeant On 23rd April I went to the place where the fire was and afterwards went to the police-station and found the three prisoners there—I did not hold out any inducement or threat to them—they told me they wished to make a statement to me—that they had come to give themselves up for setting fire to the hay rick—I told them I was willing to hear anything they might have to say at the same time I cautioned them that it would be taken down and produced in evidence—I asked them if they were willing that I should take down what they said—they said Yes and I did so—they were all three together—as one made a statement I asked the others if they agreed with it—they said Yes and they all signed it—this is it— produced —I took their shoes from their feet—I saw footmarks near the stack and compared those footmarks with their shoes in the direction they said they went and found they corresponded The prosecutor s statement was here read as follows — John Hobbs a native of London labourer Thomas Frederick Webster a native of London labourer Robert Lewer a native of London labourer state that between eleven and twelve o clock this day they came into Richmond by way of Kew Bridge that they begged the halfpence to cross the bridge and were the whole day in Richmond without anything to eat that their lives for some time past had been spent in such misery and poverty they were determined when they left London this morning to do something to alter it and looked out for a stack to set fire to About a quarter or half-past eight o clock as nearly as they can say they climbed over the gate at the farm where the stack was set fire to Mr Piggott s they all three went to the back part of the hay-stack they then made three holes in the stack by pulling out the hay so as to admit their arms as far as they could reach one in the centre the others at each end of the back part of the stack from the barn when they all three lit lueifers from a pipe which Hobbs had and set fire in the different holes at the same time the side of the stack instantly was in a blaze that they then ran away and got through a gap of the hedge behind the stack and then through another hedge by a gap into a ploughed-field across this field over a white gate into a lane behind a road then turned to the right at the top of the lane and passed New Richmond into the main road they then returned down the road and looked at the fire where they stopped till the engine arrived and then returned to Richmond came to the police-station where they gave themselves up They also all declare that they voluntarily make this statement and that no promise has been held out to them and that they have been properly cautioned that what they said would be taken down and produced in evidence against them JOHN HOBBS THOMAS FREDRICK WEBSTER ROBERT LEWER Webster s Defence My Lord and gentlemen of the jury the offence of which I stand charged is one of a very heavy character and which I am very sorry to say has brought me before your notice this day My Lord and gentlemen perhaps you will not credit what I am going to say to you but I will fearlessly speak to you convinced that I am innocent and that what I am going to say is true It is true that I was in Richmond during the day on which the fire occurred and I also was the company of the other persons charged with me and that I was also present at the fire but I can assure your Lordship that the stack was not fired by me But being reduced to the deepest distress through the want of work and not having tasted food for some time past I was induced to accompany the other persons and accuse myself of committing the crime which has caused my friends a great deal of anguish and regret that I had not applied to them for assistance My Lord I was never in the company of those persons accused with me but on theday the fire occurred nor can I to my recollection ever remember seeing them before the only thing that criminates me is the marks which the officer states was made by the shoes which I wore but I can assure you that they were not the print of my footsteps for I never entered the field where the ground was capable of receiving any impression My Lord it is not at all improbable that the marks were caused by some person who assisted at the fire and who in the excitement of the moment has not since remembered crossing the field But my Lord I hope you will pause before you proceed to sum up the evidence adduced against me for it would be doing me a great injustice without being convinced of my guilt for the confession which I signed in an unthinking moment and which has been used as evidence against me which the keen pangs of hungers has induced me to put my signature to is a falsehood of which I have had reason to repent My lord taking all these considerations before your notice and weighing the evidence brought against me I may be led to hope for a favourable issue of my trial and which I may be led to expect from an impartial and uncorrupted jury WILLIAM POCOCK police-constable F 14 I produce a certificate of Webster s former conviction— read—Convicted June 1844 and confined two✗ years —I was present at the trial—he is the person—he has been convicted at this Court since that and had three months—I proved the former conviction then WEBSTER— GUILTY Aged 20 — Transported for Twenty Years HOBBS— GUILTY Aged 23 — Transported for Fifteen Years LEWER—

am the wife of Henry Hanaford an lengraver living at 44 Rahere-street in the parish of St Luke s The prisoner is one of his apprentices and had been so for about two years—he had been living with us three years—my husband had one other apprentice and a journey mas who worked for him and who had served his time to his—he did not life with us—the two apprentices my husband myself and three gentleman lodgers lived in the house—there was no servant—on Sunday evening 5th Dec I am my husband went out soon after six o clock leaving the prisoner in the house—the other apprentice was out for the day and the three lodgers who were friends had just passed down the street before us—there was nobody left in the house but the prisoner—my husband goes to Falcon-street Chapel and I go to Church—while at Church about seven a neighbour gave me some information which induced me to go home immediately—I found a crowd there and I believe an engine—I think the prisoner was in the passage but I am not quite certain—I immediately went up stairs to the bed-room and found a policeman and fireman there—I had left the room door locked—when I got back the catch of the lock was turned down and hanging by one screw as if it had been wrenched off—the bed-furniture was nearly all burned—the cupboard-door was wide open—it is even with the wall of the room—I should suppose the cupboard is about a yard and a quarter from the bed and furniture I cannot precisely way—the papers in the cupboard were bundles of old bills and drawing-books—they were partially burned—they were in the cupboard burned—they had been put out with water I suppose—I had left the cupboard closed when I went out—I cannot be positive about its being locked but I have not the least doubt of it because there is no button to it it comes open and there is no way of fastening it except by locking it—I was not the last person that went to the cupboard—there was a tin cashbox in which my husband keeps his money in another box in the cupboard—they were open when I came back and there was no money in them then—I had seen the boxes previous to that evening—there were papers in them besides money—I am not aware that I missed anything except the money—I think there were different papers but I am not aware whether they were lost—I merely looked and saw the money was gone—my husband keeps the keys of the boxes and the cupboard—I keep the key of the bedroom—when I go out I lock the door and put the key in my pocket—the cash-coxes were brought down stairs and I then sent the prisoder for my husband—I have no recollection of the prisoner saying anything about the room-door before that—my husband very soon came back with the prisoner—there was no saucer on the bedroom table when I went out—there was one kept on my wash-band stand with soap and a brush in it—that one was on the table when I came back from Church and smelt of turpentine—there was a small portion of water and turpentine apparently in it—the cupboard and the papers smelt of turpentine—I had had turpentine myself in the room two months before this occurence so clean the bedstead with—there had been none in the room since then to my kowledge—I did not use all of it—I used all that I had in the butter-boat and the butter-boat was taken down stairs—I was in my bed-room that night when the clock struck six—there was no smell of turpentine there then—I had had my tea before I left that evening and the prisoner also—I do not know whether he had finished tea or not when we left—I left the ten-things there and told him that he might either leave them on the table or put them back till my return—a screwdriver has been shown me—my husband had one but I cannot say precisely that was is Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How long had the hell been going for Church when you went out A I should suppose not more than five or six minutes—it was not so long as ten minutes I think—the service begins at half-past six—I do not know

had a light with me—I never bought any turpentine that I know of—I might have sent the boy for some and they might have sent for some in the shop—my husband uses turpentine in his business and a composition also like pitch but not like this looking at a piece —I am not aware that this is a piece of it—it is much browner than that—the bed was not close to the cupboard I should say it was a yard off—we had had no painter on the premiser shortly before this—we had a person painting out in the yard on the Thursday or Friday in that week or he might have been there on the Satyrday I am not certain—the prisoner was admitted to bail by the Magistrate and has surrendered to-day to take his trial—he has very respectable friends—I cannot say whether I shut the street-door when I went out or my husband—it is my custom to push against it when I go out—we always treated the prisoner well—we parted on friendly terms when we went to Church that evening—when I sent him to fetch my husband from chapel he was gone as quick as possible MR HIDDLESTON Q You say you had a light when you went to dress where did you get it from A From the kitchen—it was an iron candlestick—to the best of my belief I lighted it from the kitchen candle—after I had dressed I brought it down again—while dressing I put it on the bedroom table which is about three-quarters of a yard from the cupboard—I believe there was nothing on the table but the looking-glass I cannot precisely say—my usual habit is to push against the door when I go out HENRY HANAFORD I live in Rahere-street St Luke s and am an engraver—the prisoner was my apprentice—I use turpentine in my trade—I have it in in small quantities—I had sent for a pint on the Friday before the fire—it was kept in a tin can used for the purpose in a cupboard in the yard at the back of the house—I did not use any of that on the Friday my wife did—I do not know what was done with it—I also use a composition resembling pitch—that was kept sometimes in the cupboard at the back of the house and sometimes in the shop where I do my engraving—this produced is that kind of composition—I have brought a piece with me—the workshop is at the back of the house

takes me a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes to go there—I came out with my wife—all three of my lodgers left the house at the same time—I am not quite certain who left the house last but I think it must have been me or my wife—we left no one in the house but the prisoner—while I was at chapel the prisoner came and told me a fire had taken place in my house and that it had been put out with his assistance—I accompanied him back and found the house in possession of the firemen—I went up to the back-room on the second floor which is the top of the house with the exception of a little loft—I saw there had been a fire there—it was then out—I went to the cupboard where I kept papers on the shelves—it was open—some of the papers were burnt and smelt very strongly of turpentine—there was also pitch on them—they were not all burnt they were damaged by the fire—some were in bundles and consequently were not burnt and had no marks of fire on them—I kept this cash-box produced enclosed in a larger box in the cupboard—it was locked safe on the Saturday night and contained a 10l note a 5l note and five sovereigns—the keys were in my possession—I had seen the money in the box about eight or nine o clock on Saturday night—I had received the 5l note a few days before—I had on one occasion sent the prisoner out to fetch a sixpenny receipt stamp—I did not tell him for what purpose I wanted it—I think it was during the week previous—I was in the parlour when I sent him and I think he brought it to me there—I think my customer was still there—the two boxes were locked and the cupboard also—I had the key of the cupboard—it was locked on Saturday night at about eight or nine o clock and was not opened afterwards to my knowledge—when I returned from chapel I found the cash box had been taken down stairs—it had been opened and the money was gone—the box in which it had been was also opened and the cupboard door was open—I kept papers in the cash-box but I am not prepared to say that I missed any except one—I think the prisoner said as we returned home that he was first alarmed by hearing the breaking of glass—I do not recollect what he further—I was of course agitated after having heard of the fire—I have no recollection of hearing from him low the fire originated or how the room door was opened—I saw a saucer in the bed-room which smelt of turpentine—I had not moved that saucer from where it was usually kept—there papers producing some —are those which were in the outer tin box and these are some of those that were on the shelves in the cupboard Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When the prisoner to you at the chapel did he walk home by the side of you A Yes I think be walked with my niece who was with me—I did not smell turpentine about him—it is difficult to get girl rid of the smell of it if a person had been handling it—the saucer which has been spoken of is the one the soap was kept in—the proper place for it was on the washhand-stand—it was found and produced to me from the table—it was supposed to contain turpentine and water—I do not think the contents have been preserved—I had taken some money from the cash-box on the Saturday-night—the house is insured in the Dissenters Office—they do not prosecute this inquiry—they have declined to do so—they spoke of watching the case—none of the money has been found—there is a dwarf wall in my yard surrounding the premises—I keep a ladder hanging up against that wall—the back door of the premises leading into the yard is not usually locked—there is a loft in the bed-room on the second floor—it has a skylight—some of the glass of thar is cracked—I do not knowe that any is broken—I kept some small articles of jewellery in the cash-box—I have not missed any—there were others ket in a bag on the drawers in the bed-room such as gold seals which had been sent me to engrave—I presume the prisoner was aware they were there—he is about sixteen or seventeen years old—I think it was between seven and eight o clock when he fetched me from chapel—I heard that a glass bottle was found in the yard—I cannot say whether it had turpentine in it—the prisoner was given into custody that night about eleven I think—I had a great difficulty to bring my mind to do it—I think the painter was there about a month before or thereabouts—I have no recollection of his being there on the friday—there was a part over the door of the yard which I think had been pitched during the month—I am fully satisfied there was no painting in the yard on Friday on Saturday MR BODKIN Q who did what was done A Vine—I do not know where he lives—his mother is a witness in this case—the ladder I have spoken of belongs to me—it hung up against the wall where it was usually kept—the wall is about eight or nine feet high and over that there is another person s yard MR CLARKSON Q Did not sometimes take up rages and sometimes pitch into the bed-room cupboard A Never rags until they are burnt to an ash having a portion of good of gold with then and pitch I never take up—the rags were all sold previous to the taking place so that there were none there then MR HANSAFORD re-examined There was some turpentine in a tin can on the Friday afternoon which into a errand-boy had—I cannot say when he fetched it—he poured some into a pipkin for me and I took it into the kitchen put some bees-wax with it melted it and took it into the first-floor room to rub some furniture and it remained outside the front room door in a washhand-stand—it had never been taken higher

said he and two lads put it out—I asked him how he put it out—he said by letting a pail out of the back bed-room window into the water-butt—I asked him how he found it out—he said he had taken the tea-things into the back kitchen from the front and heard some glass fall in the front kitchen area that he went to see what it was he saw people running down the street and looking up at the house and heard them call Fire that he went up stairs and forced open the parlour door with his knee—then he forces open one of the lodger s doors then he opened the street door and five or six people entered the house—one ran up stairs and he with him and they forced the back bed-room door open but could not enter because of the smoke—then the man put a handkerchief round his month and went in on his hands and knees went up towards the cupboard door but he did not know whether he went to the cupboard—the man was a stranger to him but he had spoken to the policeman and he saw him go out of the street door EDWARD WATKINS I live at 10 Mason s-place which commands a view of the back of the prosecutor s house There is a small row of houses between which we can overtook—we can see the upper part of the prosecutor s house from the top room window—on the Sunday evening of this fire I was in the court on the ground and heard an alarm of fire—I went round to Rahere-street and gave an alarm—I saw the prisoner at the door of Mr Hanaford s house—he opened it—I do not know whether I had knocked—he said the fire was there and took me down stairs into the back kitchen—he asked if any one would lend him a little assistance with a few pails of water to put the fire out—I and about six others I should say went down stairs with him—I cannot say whether he went down—he took us to a tap is the back kitchen which supplies the kitchen from the yard—I found one pail down stairs and that was used to take up water to the upper part of the house—I asked if he had not got a water-butt in the yard and some more pails—he then took us to the water-butt and we found some more pails in the yard and commenced dipping the water—I did not take any water up myself—I then went up to the top of the house to see if I could render any assistance—I did not go into any room—I saw a smoke coming from the door of the back room which was on fire—the door was open—there were other people there when I went up—I did not stay a minute—I immediately ran down stairs to fetch the engine Cross-examined Q You rendered every assistance you could A Yes and so did the prisoner as far as I know—there were two people at the room door but not in the room—when the prisoner opened the door I did not small him of turpentine at all—as near as I can tell it was half-past six o clock when I went into the house JURY Q Was the prisoner in your company all the time you were in the house A After I went into the yard to get the water I lost sight of him and did not see him afterwards—I do not know whether he was up stairs or not MARY JOHNSON I am the wife of James Johnson of 8 Mason s-place From the front of our house we can see the back of Mr Hanaford s—on this Sunday evening about a quarter past six o clock or later I saw a flame of fire in the second-floor back room at Mr Hanaford s—I opened the window and called out that there was a fire in Rahere-street and Mr Watkins was the first person I sw—I told him there was a fire there—I was not exactly looking out og window before I saw the light I was suckling my baby and happened to look up and saw the fire Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Your window is immediately opposite the back of the premises A Very nearly—I started when I saw the flame and threw up the window—I was frightened and called Five —Watkins went away directly I spoke to him ELIZABETH CALLOW I live at 36 Rahere-street About half-past six o clock on the night of the fire I saw the prisoner at the door of the house—it was almost momentarily after the alarm of fire—he had a dark japanned hand oil-lamp in his hand—it was alight—he said the fire was there—I asked how it occurred—he said he supposed it was by his mistress taking a lamp up stairs to dress for chapel that the wick had fallen or blown off the top of the lamp and set fire to the bed-curtains—I left him at the door and went back to my own house as I had left my door open—I saw several persons going in to the house at the time—I left him standing at the door Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did not he tell you that the fire was put out A No—I did not enter the house—I was first alarmed when I was in my yard by hearing a breaking of glass—it was that brought me to the street door COURT Q Where did the sound of the breaking of glass come from A A few doors up—it was at the moment of the fire—a person came from the back of the house and said there was a fire and I ran up the street with the person—I thought the breaking of glass was in the stree but it was in a yard five or six doors up next door but one to the prosecutor s house—it fell on some tin and that made a noise—it was from a person throwing up a window—the line broke and the window falling broke the glass—I did not see the window MR BODKIN Q Had you heard an alarm of fire before you heard the breaking of glass A No I heard it almost momentarily afterwards—I only went through the passage to the door and then I found a person coming round from a court at the back of the house calling out that there was a fire MARY MASHFORD I am sister-in-law to Mr Hanaford About half-past three o clock on the Sunday afternoon I was in the bed-room—there was no smell of turpentine there then—the saucer was then on the washhandstand with a piece of soap and a nail-brush in it—I left the house about four o clock Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How far was te able from the washhand-stand A I think about a yard and a half—the saucer was on the table when I went into the room about nne o clock—that was after the fire—there were firemen and policemen there then JOHN HAYNES policeman G 155 I went to this house near upon a quarter to seven o clock—I found two other constables at the door—I went up stairs to the second-floor bed-room—there were four men there outside the room—I went into the room a little way—it was full of smoke and I was obliged to come out—after chucking a great quantity of water in I tid a handkerchief round my mouth and went in on my hands and knees and pulled the top part of the window down which got rid of some of the smoke—the cupboard was open and a quantity of papers there all burnt—they were in a flame when I first went into the room—they smelt of turps—the firemen came in removed the bedstead and there found in a basket by the side of the bed by the fire place which was blocked up to keep the draft out some sheeting all alight—I saw it found—the bedstead was close against the fireplace and so was the basket—it was underneath the bed—there was nothing between the bedstead and the fireplace—the cupboard was at the corner by the foot of the bed—the side of the bed was to the chimney and the head towards the door up against the wall—the fireplace almost faced the door——the window was on the left hand and the cupboard in the corner between the fireplace and the window—the cupboard door opened flush with the wall—a table was under the window against it—the cupboard was almost at the end of the bed—if you walk down the side of the bed next the wall and opposite the door you would pass the chimney-piece then come to the cupboard and the window faces the foot of the bed—the cupboard door comes down to the floor—the cupboard was between the foot of the bed and the window—it was quite clear of the foot of the bed—there was quite room for it to open—when it opened it fell back towards the window—the open part would be nearest the fireplace the basket and bedstead—the cupboard shelves were about a yard from the bed-curtains—the foot of the bed was about a foot from the chimney-board—the bed was close against the wall originally—the firemen pulled it out when they found this basket—the curtains were burnt from the foot up to the head—there was only the back part left—I did not see whether the curtains had been drawn down to the foot or whether the lower part of the bedstead or curtains were burnt—I did not notice the table till about five minutes after the firemen came in—there was a saucer on the table—I examined it and there was about a table-spoonfull of turps and water it it—I saw the prisoner in the passage when I first entered the house—I did not see him up stairs till Mr Hanaford was fetched—I did not give directions for her to be fetched—she came up stairs and the prisoner with her—he said nothing in my presence—I found this glass bottle in the yard by the side of the water-butt—it contained about a tablespoonful of pure turpentine—I saw the firemen pull the cash—boxes out of the cupboard when Mr Hanaford asked for them upon being asked for the policy and I carried them down stairs—they were not wide open then—they were undone as they are now—I heard Mr Hanaford send the prisoner to fetch her husband from chapel—that was about three-quarter of an hour after I got there Cross-examined Q What time did Mr Hanaford come A I cannot say—Mr Hanaford sent for him directly she came—I never had the turps and water in my possession—I only knew what it was by smelling it—I cannot tell what proportion of water there was—I had thrown full a dozen and a half pails of water into the room—there had been four pails in use—they had been in the yard where we found the tin can in which the turpentine was—I do not know whether there had been any turpentine in any of those pails or whether any of them had been knocked over—the whole room smelt very much of turpentine—I went into the room on my hands and knees—I do not know how anybody else went in or whether anybody went in before I came—I found four people at the room—door when I went up—none of them are here—the prisoner did not tell me that there was valuable property of his master s upon which he was working on the drawers in the room MR HEDDLESTON Q Did you see the tin can in the yard A No another constable brought it up stairs—I know nothing about it—the bottle I found was lying on its side with the cork in it—nothing had escaped from that as far as I know—Sergeant Brown was with me WALTER HENRY BROWN policeman-sergeant G 16 On this Sunday I went to the house between seven and half-past and found the prisoner there with Mr Hanaford in the back parlour—these two boxes were produced—I asked if there was anybody to send for Mr Hanaford and the prisoner went—I went with the firemen into the top back bed-room—I noticed the door—there was a slight indent between the door and the wood-work as though a screwdriver or something of that sort had been pushed in—there were two marks one about six inches below and the other about six inches above the lock—I went to the cupboard door it was wide open and on one of the shelves where the cash box was close against the wall and in front of the cash-box was a quantity of paper—this burnt paper and pitch was by the side of the cash-box—a quantity of loose paper had been on fire and this pitch was between it—the paper was very wet with turpentine and water—there was full half a bushel of paper beside that which was burnt—the lock of the cash-box appeared to be towards the wall and immediately over the cash-box on the next shelf was this hare s foot—the paper was on the shelf where the cash-box was and on the shelf above it—there was an indent on the cupboard door as though a screwdriver or some instrument had been used to force it open—it was near the lock but more towards the door so as to release the lock from the door as if by being prised—it had been forced back—the bolt of the lock had been released from the hasp—the bolt was shot when I saw it—I compared the marks with a screwdriver which Mr or Mr Hanaford gave me out of the back kitchen—it appeared that the same instrument had been used to open both doors—I have brought the cupboard door here but not the room door—the marks on the bed-room door corresponded with those on the cupboard door—the cash-box was on a shelf and above that was another shelf on which there was a quantity of loose paper and just projecting over the shelf above the box was this hare s foot quite saturated with turpentine and the whole of the paper on both shelves was sprinkled with turpentine—the shelves were burnt a very little at the edge—at the top part of the bed-room door the paint was blistered by the fire as though the fire had escaped after the door was opened—the bed furniture and some part of the things were burnt and the chimney-board—I saw pitch in the cupboard and on the papers—the centre part of the paper was much more burnt than that above and below—that was n the shelf that the box was on—the edges of the paper above were burnt—some of the papers which were not burnt had stains of turpentine on them—I did not notice any marks of turpentine on the cupboard door—when his master came home the prisoner and he went with me into the bed-room—I asked the prisoner how the fire originated—he said he did not know—I asked how he first discovered it—he told me he thought it was on the first floor that he went there and found it was not there he went to the second floor and found it was in his mistress s bed-room—I asked if the door was open and he said it was shut—I asked bow he got it open—said he got a pair of tongs and gave it a blow it then gave way a little and he pushed the remainder open with his hand—I examined the door—there were no marks of tongs on it—the prisoner was given into custody about eleven o clock—he said It looks very black against me I am innocent I not care for myself only for my poor mother —I asked him in his master s presence in the bed-room if he knew that his master had any money—he said Yes he should judge he had from buying a stamp only a day or two before which he gave 6d for—in the outer cash-box there was an indenture of apprenticeship—I found grazes of some small instrument on both cash-boxes—I cannot say that that was done with the same instrument that the marks on the door were done with Cross-examined Q What tie dod you come A Between seven and half-past—I did not find the bed-room full of water it was swamped with water—I first saw the cash-boxes down stairs on the table—the papers was on the shelves—I did not say not that there were papers above the box and below it I said above and below the shelf—I did see the box on the shelf but I saw it first down stair—there were no papers down stair then with the exception of those that were in the box—I took the boxes up stairs for the firemen to show me how they were found—I said nothing to Mr Hanaford about giving the boy in custody before he did so—I did not tell him that if he did not give the boy in custody the fire-office would prosecute him—no such thing was said to my knowledge—I said it was a suspicious matter—the fire was quite out when I got to the house—I am a police-sergeant—while I was waiting for my men I heard to the there was a fire in Rahere-street and went there—my men were engaged at the house—I first began to question the boy about eight o clock when his master came home with him from chapel—it might have occupied ten minutes—I did not cross-examine him for half an hour—there were no cross questions—I asked him who his acquaintances were and if he had a sweetheart that was all—I did not ask him if he had been to a public-house or a private-house—I swear I did not GABRIEL GRAVETT policeman G 235 I was on duty in the street about half-past six o clock in the evening—there was an alarm of fire and I saw the mob run to the house—I went to the house—the door was opened just as I reached it by the prisoner he said The fire is here come in and several people entered just before me and I followed—he said it was is the back bed-roomn second floor—after I had gone in I closed the door to keep anybody else from coming in—I went up stairs and saw the room was fall of fire—I came down and sent for the engine and the turncock—I could not go into the room on account of the fire and smoke—the door was open —the prisoner said he went up stairs and broke it open with the tongs and then discovered the fire was there and that he came down stairs and opened the door directly—he told me that just after I entered the house—I did not examine the room door—I was not down stairs more than two or three minutes when I went up again there was nobody in the room that I am aware of—I could not see any one and I believe there was not—they were then throwing water into the room—the fire was as bad as it had been—I saw Haynes go into the room on his hands and knees that was ten minutes after I had come up—I had been down stairs to the passage to prevent people coming in and when I returned he went in—the fire was then to some extent subdued—I saw the prisoner on the stairs while the water was being carried up—he repeated several times that his master kept some property and his work in that room and I told Haynes if he could find a desk or anything portable he had better bring it out—I cannot say whether the prisoner was present then—I asked the prisoner if he knew what his master kept his property in and he said No Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did no he appear desirous that somebody should go immediately into the room to secure the property A No I dare say that was his object in mentioning it—five or six people went into the house with me—there were none there before me—I swear there were not a dozen there—I do not know whether Watkins was there or not—I suppose it was about half-past six o clock—I was there before Sergeant Brown—the prisoner never asked me to go in and secure the property—he said two or three times and perhaps four that his master kept his work and his property there—I dare say he was anxious to get it out—I believe he did not repeat two or three times his wish to get his master s property and work out of the bedroom—I did not hear him say so—I do not recollect it MR BODKIN Q Were the three or four persons that were up at the bedroom when you got there all persons who had come in at the same time as you A Yes MR CLARKSON to EDWARD WATKINS Q Were there any policemen going in when you went in A No none went up stairs with me MR BODKIN Q How long were you in before you saw them A They were stationed at the door when I went in—I do not know whether any of the followed me or not JOHN CRUMPTON I belong to the Whitecross-street Fire Brigade I went to the house about ten minutes to seven o clock—Gravett opened the door for me—I went up stairs and found Haynes there—the fire was not quite extinguished—the boards before the fire-place were nearly burnt through—there was a basket of linen under the bed one end of which was burnt—I asked the prisoner how he had discovered the fire—he said by the falling of glass or something similar down at the back from the back window—I understood him to mean the back of that house—I did not ask him any questions about it—he said he got into the room by breaking the door open with a pair of tongs and he had been in the room once before three months before—I was the first person that too the tin boxes out of the cupboard—they were open HENRY HANAFORD re-examined This hare s foot which has been produced is a thing which I use in my trade—I had several of them and generally kept them in that cupboard—I also keep tools of different kinds there—the hare s foot was shown to me on the night of the fire—it smelt of turpentine to the best of my recollection—I can say with respect to the papers but not with respect to the hare s foot my memory does not serve me—I think it very probable that I might have ad a hare s foot there that day because of my having them there—I never use hare s feet for turpentine—I use them to sweep up the gold cuttings which I take from the engraved articles—I never had any turpentine in that closet MR BODKIN Q To what amount is your property insured A To 100l but I consider it to be worth about 200l WALTER HENRY BROWN re-examined I noticed the hare s foot when I found it it was quite saturated with turpentine MRS HANAFORD re-examined A person named Davis who is here came to the Church and gave me information of the fire ELIZABETH DAVIS I received the information about half-past six o clock as near as I can recollect MR CLARKSON Q Were you passing the door hearing the alarm or seeing the fire did you go in A I went in and asked the prisoner where his mistress was—he told me she was at church and I went to the church to fetch her John Winter wine-merchant st Helen s-walk Martha william widow Windmill-street Finsbury Isaac White tailor 28 Tabernacle-walk Finsbury T

t18481023-2357  2357 MARY JANE FITZGERALD and JAMES FRY feloniously setting fire to a house in the possession of Emma Beaumont with intent to injure and defraud the Westminster Fire-office and EMMA BEAUMONT for feloniously inciting them to commit the said felony MESSRS CLARKSON BODKIN and PARNELL conducted the Prosecution JOSEPH BAXTER I am not now in any habitation—I did live in White Horse-yard Drury-lane—I am a porter in Covent Garden-market In May last I went to lodge at the European Coffee-house in Long Acre which was kept by Beaumont—I left on Monday 21st Aug as near as I can recollect—I had known Beaumont before by using the House and I had lodged there previously—she spoke to me several times about firing the house—she said she would not mind giving 10l to any one to do it—that was about a month or six weeks before I went away—she said as she had known me so long she would not mind giving me 10l to set fire to the house—I said I would consider of it or something to that effect—I knew that the house and property were insured—Beaumont showed me the policy on three different occasions—isaw that the amount was for 400l —after I had told her that I would consider this proposition of hers I saw things taken away from the house several time such as baskets of China and glass—I saw the bedding cut up and made into pillows—I saw Fitzgerald who was servant in the house take the pillows away she told me it was by Beaumont s orders—I have seen her take them away when Beaumont was in the house—on the day that I left Beaumont said the things were ready and asked me what time it would be convenient to me to set fire to the house—she said the Thursday would be convenient for her and would I go to tnke tea with her—this conversation took place in the little bar—I do not know that there was anybody there but Beaumont and I Fitzgerald might have been in and out following her occupation—I said the Thursday would suit me or words to that effect—I led her to believe that I would do it—I went again on the Tuesday—I do not recollect that anything passed respecting this matter—she sent for me on the Thursday and I went about five o clock—Kitzgerald went in with me-Beaumont was not there but a young woman was who was a stranger-Beaumont wme in and 1 had tea with her—she said all was ready and we might as well go through with it as things bad gone so far—she said she had appointed to go to the theatre with Fry at half-price and that I was to set fire to the house while she was gone—she put down three sovereigns on the side-board and told me I might take it from the side-board that I might say she had not given me any money to fire the house and that I had not taken any money from her hand—I took up the three sovereigns and kept them—she said she would give me two sovereigns on the following morning Friday and 5l after she had settled with the Insurance Company—during the conversation and the giving of the money Fitzgerald was in and out—I think she was in the room when the three sovereigns were laid down and I took them up but I cannot say for certainty—the bar opens into the public room and the private passage—when Fitzgerald was not in the bar she was passing up and down stairs to the kitchen ami bed-room—I do not know that she went into the coffee-room while I was there—Fry was in the coffee-room not in the bar—he was not near enough to hear what parsed between me and Beaumont—there were several other persons in the coffee-room where Fry was—Fry came into the bar to change a book but he only came for a moment and he went out at the coffee-shop door—the other door leads to the passage—Beaumont beckoned to him in the coffee-shop to go out and they went out by different doors and met in the street-after they were gone I had some conversation with Fitzgerald—I told her I was goin into the country that night and I had no intention of setting fire to the house—she said she thought as much—I did not stop five minutes—I left London that night and went to Watford—I came to town again the next night Friday 25th I arrived by the train about seven—I sent George Priest who had been my companion in travel to the house in Long Acre to make inquiries and in consequence of what he told me I went to the house about nine—I found Fitzgerald standing at the private-door—I asked her what Miss Beaumont had said concerning my going away with the money—she said Miss Beaumont said she thought I had acted very right in going away—she said it heinr the opera night it would soon have got found out—she said her mistress was gone to Cromorne Gardens with the same young man that she had been to the theatre with the niht previous—she said the fire was going to take place that niht—she Said she was to have 20l and Fry was to have 20l also—she said there was a written agreement on a 3d stamp and Beaumont and Fry had each signed their names to it and she had made her mark at the bottom—she said Mrs Robins was in the house at the time I was speaking to her at the door—she went in and shut the door—I waitid opposite the house a few minutes—I saw Mrs Robins and Fitzgerald come out-Mrs Robins had a bundle under her arm—Fitzgerald went with her to the corner of James-street which is 100 or 150 yards from the house—they there parted and Fitzgerald went back to the house—I then went away to 21 White Hart-yard and a friend with me—I was not out any more that night—I went to bed about ten—on the following morning I went to the market—I saw Mr Davis that I had been working for and in consequence of what he told me I went to Long-acre about eight in the morning—I noticed that there had been a fire at Beaumont s house—about nine or ten o clock that morning Fitzgerald came to my lodging and told me it was all over—I had told her where I lodged—I had her boxes at my lodging—I had taken them there on the Tuesday night—I took them out of the house that night and she said it was too late to take them to her friend s where she intended them to go to and would I permit them to be in my lodging and I took them there and there they remained till that morning—she told me it was all over and the Insurance-office had made it out as an escape of gas—I asked her how it was done and she said she put a light or a lighted greasy paper under the place where the old newspapers were kept and it was all on fire in a moment—this was on the Saturday—on the Monday I was in Covent-garden market-Fitzgerald came to me there—she told me that Beaumont wished to speak to me and would I go to No 13 King-street Long-acre that is where her brother lived—I went there after Fitzgerald had left me—I saw Beaumont s brother—I waited a few minutes and Beaumont came in—it is a little shop—her brother was in the private parlour-Beaumont said I need not be afraid she would give me the remaining 7l as though I had set fire to the house myself—I think she said I was not to mention it to anybody I was to keep it a secret—I said Very well —I then came away—on the Wednesday afterwards I saw Fitzgerald again in Covent-garden market or somewhere adjoining I think it was in James-street—I gave her a note to take to Beaumont—she came back after she had taken it and told me that Miss Beaumont said I might do what I liked if I said anything concerning the fire that she would charge me with stealing some books that I had the care of—there were three books a writing-desk a bird-cage and some other trifling things that she had given me—I told Fitzgerald I would go and give information to the Fire-office—she said I might go as soon as I liked—I do not recollect that anything more passed on that occasion—I think I saw Fitzgerald again on the Friday—I told her I had communicated to the Insurance Company which I had not I did not make the communication till the next day the Saturday —she said I had done very wrong in stating that she had set fire to the house it was a mistake—she said I had misunderstood her when she told me that Fry had proposed to bring 3s worth of combustibles to put under the cupboard—that might have been on the Wednesday it was after the fire—I informed the Insurance-office on the following day and on Monday the 4th I attended at Mr Storr the agent s office—I found Miss Beaumont there and her sister Mrs Matthews—I waited till Mr Storr sent for me in-1 was in the same room with Miss Beaumont and her sister the public auction-room-Miss Beaumont came to me and asked if I had been sent for there—I said No I was come there to meet a friend—she asked me to go outside with her which I refused to do-Mrs Matthews came and said there was something very mysterious between her sister and me and she wanted to know the meaning of it-Miss Beaumont told her there were some trifling sums of money that she owed me if I would make out my bill she would pay me—I told Matthews it was no use asking me such a question as that that she knew all about it—Miss Beaumont said if I would go outside with her or meet her at her brother s at three o clock she would give me 10l —I refused that and soon after Mr Storr called for me and 1 went out of the room and left them to themselves—I knew there was a ladder at the house that was burnt I had seen it several times—it was kept down stairs in the passage and sometimes I have seen it at the top of the house—Miss Beaumont desired me to take it from the passage up to the top of the house—there is a trap-door opening at the top of the house—I put the fodder on the top landing that would enable a person to get out at that opening Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q How long have you worked at Covent-garden market A For many years off and on—I went to live at this coffee-house in April or May—I do not know the name of the servant who was there then—she was a short stout person—she left—that was not Fitzgerald—Fitzgerald had been in the house perhaps six weeks or two months—I had lodged there about twelve months before—Beaumont said as she had known me so Iong—she would give me 10l to fire the house—I had been away from the house as a lodger though I had used it—I had been down to Yorkshire to see my relations and friends—this conversation was on the Monday as I was leaving the house—Beaumont knew I was about to leave—I agreed to go on the Thursday to set fire to the house as she thought—I gave her to understand that I should do it—I never had it in my own mind to do it-1 wanted money for what I had done for her—I had been working for her—I took the 3l for the work I had done—I understood the 3l I received to he for work 1 had done for her—I took it as such not that she paid it as such—she never made any arrangement what I was to have but I considered it good payment for the work I had done—we are in the habit of putting a price on the work we do—I considered that this 3l would be liberal payment and having got this liberal payment I went to enjoy myself at Watford and at Northampton—I walked to Watford and them engaged a bed from half-past three till half-past six o clock I then took the train to Northampton—I came back the same day by the train—I had done several jobs for Beaumont—Fitzgerald was servant in the house—she did not very often attend customers in the shop—there was a kitchen but it was not used for cooking it was merely to keep lumber and different things in—when I took up the 3l Fitzgerald was in and out-Fry came in once but there was no one when 1 took up the 3l —when I went at five o clock there was a stange young woman there—I was up stairs in the sitting-room for nearly an hour—there was no light there—I was in the dark—Miss Beaumont did not speak very loudly to me it was not a whisper it was in a moderate tone—I paid a trifle for Priest when we went to Northampton I might not have paid for everything he had money—I went to the house on Friday the 25th—I did not see Miss Beaumont at all that evening—I should think I was not more than a quarter of an hour altogether in the street that evening—I then went home to bed in White Horse-yard—I got to bed about ten—Priest slept with me—I applied to Miss Beaumont for my wages after the fire—a letter was sent by Fitzgerald—I do not recollect that I said to any one that this fire was an accident I cannot swear that I did not—I might have mentioned it as an accident but if I have it is unbeknown to me—I had not been speaking to many persons about the fire before I went to the Insurance Company—I had told my friend when he was on the railway with me—after the fire I did not mention it to any one before I went to the Insurance Company Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Is this paper your writing heading a paper to the witness A I cannot swear to my own writing—I would not swear that it is or not—it is something similar to my writing yes it is my writing— the witness read the two first lines to himself —I have never described this occurrence as an accident that I am aware of—I will not undertake to swear that I have or not—I am twenty-five years old—I have been in London six years I came from Yorkshire—I never was on intimate terms with Fitzgerald—I never said that if I got the other 7l I would have given no information—it was my intention to give information to the office let me get what I would—when Mrs Robins came out of the house on the Friday evening she had a bundle—it was not very large it was as large as a person could well carry under their arm one that any one could see—it was about nine—when Mrs Matthews spoke to me I said she knew all about it I meant that she knew how the fire had happened-seeing them together I thought she must have known—I did not set fire to the house—I was never engaged in a similar transaction—I was never in any other part of this Court I have been a witness—I never was charged—I can prove I left my two situations with a good character—I was for twelve months a labourer in a brewery at Old Brentford—I was discharged with another servant on the 4th March last because they had no further employ for us—I then went down to Yorkshire and stopped nearly two months there—when I left my master he told me he would give me a good character to obtain a situation anywhere—I did not apply for the 1l I made an application in the note—I did not mention any sum—I wanted a trifle to maintain myself till I got to my friends—I did not threaten If you don t give me money I will go to the fire-office —I said You will hear further from me —it was rot in consequence of her not giving me money that I gave information—it was after I made the application that I gave the information because she threatened to charge me with stealing the thing MR BODKIN Q You sent a note A Yes this is it— read — To Miss E Beaumont 13 King-street Madam —I am sorry to inform you that I have lost my work since your accident and you must think that I want some money and I must have it or you will hear something of it before this time to-morrow I know that you have got it and you only give it at once and then it will be done with if you don t let me have it you must look out for three of you being in the station to-night —I never got any money in consequence of this note COURT Q You say here Only give it at once and then it will be done with —what did you mean by that A I do not know—I do not remember putting Only give it at once GEORGE PRIEST I am the person who went to Northampton with Baxter WILLIAM BROMFITT STORR I am of the firm of Debenham and Storr of King-street Coven t-garden We act as agents and valuers to the Westminster Fire-office On 30th Aug I went to 21 Long Acre—I had that day got a claim from the prisoner Beaumont—she called on me on the following day the 31st on the subject of that claim—I asked her about the policy—she said it was destroyed by the fire-in this claim there are forty aprons charged a black satinette dress unfinished a black velvet shawl embroidered a cashmere dress a black satin shawl a black satin dress unfinished a pair of fur cuffs and two water-coloured cuts with gilt frames—when I was in conversation with Beaumont the claim was in my hand and it was discussed—on the 2nd Sept I went to Cottrill and Harrison pawnbrokers in Drury-lane—I saw something there that I thought important and I made an appointment with Miss Beaumont to see her at her brother s at three o clock that day—she came and I asked her to describe the satinette dress and what she meant by the term unfinished—she said that it was a satinette in the length not made up—I asked her the same question in reference to the black satin dress and she gave the same answer—she said that one of the dresses either the satin or the satinette was complete with the exception that a piece had been cut off for an apron—I appointed to see her again at eight in the evening and Is saw her at her brother s—I asked her what kind of dress the cashmere dress was and she said an old one and unpicked that she had had it for a deceased relative—she said that the cuffs matched a large fur cape and that they were squirrel-fur—she said one of the water-coloured portraits was of her sister and the other of herself—she described the sizes-one was in a gold frame about eighteen inches and the other a miniature in a black enamel frame—on 4th Sept on my return to my office I found Fitzgerald there about ten—she was ordered into my room—I asked what she wanted—she said her name was Fitzgerald that she was servant to Miss Beaumont and she had called for the purpose of giving me information respecting the fire in Long Acre—I took down what she said on this paper— reads — I heard Miss Beaumont say to Baxter that she would give him 20l if he would set fire to the house this was three months ago She said she was highly indebted and she owed three quarters rent to her landlord and he would not grant her a lease and therefore she would injure his house Accordingly she kept sending me out with her clothes to pledge this was about last Saturday fortnight but others were taken about three weeks before that She told me it was to pay her landlord and instead of that when she received the money altogether and the trinkets she told me that she would take the money and trinkets to Mrs Robinson of Oxford-street shoemaker On last Thursday week a young man called upon Miss Beaumont and took her out as they said to the Hay market theatre—on that day before they went she agreed with Baxter to set fire to the house but he never said he would or he would not do it—she laid down 3l on the dresser and said to him Baxter I won t give it into your hands in case that I should be put to my oath that I gave you any money —Baxter took the money up—I was standing at the sink washing cups and saucers up—after that Miss Beaumont and her young man went away leaving myself and Baxter in the house—when Miss Beaumont was gone he turned round to me and said if he could get 50l to do it he would not do such a thing and he would go off into the country before she could pull him up for the money—he then went away—in the course of the day I heard Miss Beaumont and the young man in conversation about setting fire to the house—the young man said to her Get three shillings-worth of powder and put it into some greasy paper and place it near the fire and it will blow the roof up —Miss Beaumont returned half an hour after Baxter had gone—the young man came the next morning to breakfast—Beaumont told him how Baxter had served her out about the money—he was there all day talking to Miss Beaumont about the fire settling how it should be done—she promised him 20l and also that when she got her money she would go to Australia with him and if I would like to go with her she would take me as her servant or if not she would give me some money—I told her I did not want her money and that 1 was never bribed to do such a thing-Miss Beaumont sent me out for a threepenny stamp upon which they wrote something which they told me was by the God above this secret was not to be revealed by either of us—she signed this paper after he had done so and then made me put a cross to my name to it—after doing this I got frightened and ran away and went to my cousin—Miss Beaumont came after me there but she did not see me as I had hid myself—this was in the afternoon from one to four o clock—I returned to Long Acre about half-past four—Miss Beaumont went out and bought me a pair of bouts and brought them to me and told me she was going to Cremorne Gardens that night with the young man she would not return before one o clock—she said that I had better go to bed after the shop was shut and when she came home she would ring double—when I was at tea Mrs Robinson came in—she Miss Beaumont and the young man went up-stairs and remained there more than an hour and a half-before Mrs Robinson went she took three or four large books out of the bar on the shelf on the right hand side as you go into the bar from the coffee-room over a little box—Mrs Robinson said they were nice books and it was a pity that they should be destroyed and I said Do you know that my mistress is going to do such a thing and she answered me and said she never was astonished so much as when she returned to her own home after she had been out during the day to find a large parcel or Miss Beaumon s containing duplicates and money and clothes—the parcel also contained two 5l -notes gold and silver and the policy—Mrs Robinson left Long Acre about nine o clock—Miss Beaumont before she left gave me orders to put the kettle over the gas and leave the boilers over the fire—I did as she told me—at a quarter to eleven I went to bed not thinking that Miss Beaumont had set any trap for me—at about a quarter to twelve I was awoke by the ringing and knocking of the police—my room was full of smoke—I got up the steps of the cock-loft I could not go further and Mr Tucker sent two of his young men—I had only my night-gown and cap on—my gown I slipped on outside my night-dress—I went into one of Mr Tucker s bed-rooms and I went that night to Miss Beaumont s brother s house—Miss Beaumont and the young man came to King-street Seven Dials Beaumont s brother s house about one or two o clock in the morning—the next day she wished me to keep with her and wished me to say everything she wished me to say about her clothes her money and other things that had been destroyed—I have been here and made a statement some of it is true and some is what she told me to say which is not true—Baxter took my box away on the Tuesday previous to the fire—I slept four nights commencing on Saturday at Mrs Moore s No 2 Bell-court Gray s-inn-lane—on Wednesday night I slept at my cousin s at Deptford—his name is Dan Fitzgerald 2 Lower Deptford near the Dockyard 3 gardener—Miss Beaumont s sister Mrs Matthews a fruit-saleswoman in the Borough-market bought me a pair of shoes on Thursday after the fire—on Thursday Miss Beaumont promised me 20l if I would stay with her and do as she told me—Mrs Matthews also wanted to take me and Miss Beaumont over the water with her and take a famished room for us—I told her that I would not go but would still lodge at Mrs Moore s—I slept there that night and have continued to do so—before the fire Miss Beaumont gave me to take care of for her a file of bills two brass-work baskets her own likeness and that of her sister a brass lock and a box containing some bills —I had seen Baxter before that on the Saturday morning at the Westminster Fire-office—he was not in custody or under charge—on his arrival I was sent for—I knew nothing of Fitzgerald—she had been and made a statement before Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Was she not excited in making this statement to you A She was not at all so ELIZABETH ROBINS I am the wife of James Robins a shoemaker at 385 Oxford-street—I know Beaumont—she came to my house on Friday 25th Aug the day that the fire took place—she came about one o clock—she had a parcel on her arm and asked me if I would allow her to change her dress—I said I expect my husband in to dinner you know he does not like it but you can go with my little girl to change it —she went up stairs but I did not know what part she went to—I did not see her when she came down—I saw her that evening in her own house—she had shortly before that had a pair of boots from my house and I went for the boots or the money—Miss Beaumont said I should have them—there was a woman present but I do not know her—Miss Beaumont said to her Shall I tell Mrs Robins —I did not hear the answer—Miss Beaumont said to me We are going to have a fire —I looked towards the parlour and said Why you have got one —she said We are going to have another —she asked me if I could give her change—I said No —she asked me to lend her 5s which I did—she then went out with a young man—she said before she went to the servant Give Mrs Robins that little parcel and that parcel contained the boots—after Miss Beaumont was gone I asked the person who was there to be quick in giving it me—the person who was left there was a woman a servant I suppose—she was washing up some cups and saucers—I thought at Bow-street that Fitzgerald was the person—to the best of my belief she is but I could not swear to it—she asked me for change—I said I had not got it—she then said would I mind the place while she got it—she said she was dry—I said Why not take some coffee or tea —she said she did not take that—I said Well bring in a sip of beer —when she came back she asked me if I heard what Miss Beaumont said—I said I heard her say she was going to have a fire I thought it was in another part of the house—she said No I am to set fire to the house —I asked her over again and she said the same—I said You are never going to do such a thing as that are you —she said she had promised Miss Braumont—I said You will be handed if you do that you must be mad or have some bad advisers —she then said a man named Baxter had 3l to do it the night before—I asked who this man was—she said he was a low-lived fellow in Covent-garden market—I asked her where he was—she said he had gone away—I asked her who was in the house the last night—she said herself—I said Well as you are here to-night I hope you will not attempt to do such a thing —she said she had promised Miss Beaumont—I said Never mind what you promised her for God s sake do not do it you will surely be hung —she promised me faithfully she would not do it—she said Miss Beaumont had been to my house—I said Yes —she said What did she come for —I said I suppose to change her dress she brought a clean one —she said If she did that was not all for she has left 40l and a lot of duplicates at your house —as I was going back to my own house I took three books and I said to her Tell Miss Beaumont I shall expect to see her to-morrow or else on Sunday when the house is closed —I went home and went into a room in my house I found a lot of duplicates a lot of stamped receipts a lot of papers a dress and 4l 12s in silver loose 6l in gold in a small tin box and two 5l -notes in a pocket-book—they were in a small unoccupied room at the top of my house where Beaumont had gone with my little girl—they were all in the room with a dress covered over them so that no one would see the parcel—they were rolled up in two separate rags and there was a little basket as well laid on the chair—I brought them down stairs and put them in a little box and locked them up—I took them to my neighbour Mrs Garratt 7 Wardour-street and asked her to be kind enough to let me leave them there—I took all there but 8s which Beaumont owed me and which I took out—I saw Beaumont the next morning early as near as I can recollect it was half-past five o clock—I said What has brought you here —she said Oh my place has been on fire —I said Then that wretch has done it has she —she did not make any answer—my bell rung I had a child very ill—she left savin she would come again that day—she came again and asked me for an officer or a lawyer—I asked her what she wanted and she said Perhaps you can tell me how to make out for a fire insurance —I told her she got me in great trouble by coming there that I had never had a fire and I hoped I never should but I had a sister who had had a fire and she might go to her—I could not say much to her as my husband was cross—she went away and did not come again till the Monday when I told her what the servant had stated to me about the fire and asked her if it were true—she would not make me any answer to it—I said Will you take your few things that you left —she said she could not take them then—I said You must for I could not have them left in my house and was obliged to take them out —she left and on the following Tuesday morning she came again she said for her money—while she was there Mrs Matthews came—she said that Baxter was waiting for Beaumont and she must go home directly—I understood that Baxter was waiting at her brother s—before Miss Beaumont went she said I was to give the money to her sister—I went to King-street—I there saw Miss Beaumont Fitzgerald and Baxter—Mrs Matthews told me that Fitzgerald was the servant—I directly said to her Oh did you not promise me you would not do such a thing —she said Yes I did —I said Did you do it —she would not answer—I got the parcel and the duplicates back from Garratt and gave them to Miss Beaumont—I unlocked the little box and took them out—I did not count the duplicates till the next day—there were forty-two or forty-three—when I left Miss Beaumont s house I had a small parcel which I concealed with the boots COURT Q Did you leave the house by yourself or did anybody go with you A I left it by myself Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q You saw Miss Beaumont about half-past five o clock the next morning A Yes—she said There has been a fire —I was astonished to hear it after the statement I had heard—I sent Miss Beaumont to my eldest sister who lives at Hackney—she had had a fire some years before—I had got home on the evening before and was in my shop by a quarter before nine—when I first went to Long Acre it was a little after seven—I had not tea there—I went to a shop in Drury-lane and stopped there some time—these are the books produced Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q How long have you known Beaumont A Fifteen years and her family—occasionally when I have been out on a Sunday I have called—I used to be very friendly before her mother died but since then there has not been so much intimacy—I have been to the coffee-house—I may have seen Fitzgerald there but I do not recollect her—I may have been there six times in the last twelve months—I was not long in conversation with Fitzgerald on the Friday night—Beaumont left me in the house for the servant to fetch me the boots—I did not stop there long—I was standing the whole time—this conversation took place in the bar—there was no person there—the coffee-room was full of people—I had only a small parcel and the books—I took the books of my own accord—I have been in the habit for fifteen years of having books to read—I did not say it was a pity these books should be burnt—one of these is a penny work put together—it has gone forth in the public press that I stole three beautiful books—Beaumont has come to my place before and changed her dress—I did not go up into the room after she had left—I looked at these things because it was said that I had got 40l —I took out 8s 5s for one pair of boots and 3s for another—I was applied to by Sergeant Thompson to give evidence about a week after the fire—I did not give him any information—I did not know anything about it—I could not say that they had done it—on the day after the fire Beaumont seemed in a wild distracted state as if out of her mind—I do not know that she is a woman of weak mind—I have known her many years—I believed them to be respectable till this MR PARNELL Q Who let you out of the coffee-house A I think the servant—I went down Angel-street—I did not pass James-street—I never go that way home RICHARD AVANT I am assistant to Cottrill and Harrison pawnbrokers in Drury-lane I produce a length of satin for a dress not made up a remnant of satinette an embroidered velvet shawl twenty-five aprons a victorine a pair of cuff s made of

of money and they were left for security—on the satin was lent 2l and on the satinette 2l and on this shawl with two other articles 1l 1s —that is nothing like the value of the articles—she said they were going into the country and merely wanted the money for the journey—I placed them in separate parcels for her to send for them the officer Thompson has produced to me the counterparts of the duplicates—I have a number of other things pawned—the money lent on them was about one-third of their value—Thompson produced a bank-note to me—it bears my writing on it—when I paid Fitzgerald the

she had better give herself up before it was advertised in the paper and she knew she should be transported—she said her mistress had promised to give her 20l and the young man was to have 20l —she did not say who had told about it—she said the young man would not have split against them had her mistress given him the money Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Did she tell you she had been awakened that night by the ringing of the bell A She told me she went to bed and was awoke by a dreadful smother and the ringing of the bell that she was dragged out of bed by a butcher and two men over the top of one or two of the houses—she was perfectly sober but she was irritated CATHARINE MATTHEWS I am the sister of Emma Beaumont—I went with Mr Robins to Mr Garrett s in Wardour-street on 28th Aug —Mrs Robins brought away a parcel—it was taken to King-street where Beaumont s brother lives—I saw it opened the next morning—it contained forty-two duplicates and two 5l notes—I took the parcel home

and other things pawned at Messrs Cottrill s in Drury-lane—they are the corresponding duplicates to those which the pawnbroker s assistant has produced—I found a flower-pot in the area—I turned it out

Beaumont the othrr is a likeness of her sister who is dead—I produce a 5l -note which has Messrs Cottrill s assistant s writing on it—it was brought to Bow-street by Mrs Matthews ANN GARRETT I am waitress at the Aldersgate dining-rooms in the Minories In May last I was in Beaumont s service at 53 Long Acre for about six weeks—I left her on account of her mentioning about a fire—she wished to take me to the theatre with her one night and she said she thought she could set the man Baxter to set fire to the house while we were away—I do not know the words I used but I refused to do it—she spoke about it two or three times in a similar manner—I gave her still the same answer and that I wished to leave her—I was to receive a present for it but I do not know what—the last time she spoke to me about it I told her similar to what I had said before and that 1 should leave that day—I left that day—I do not know the day of the month it was in June or July I suppose—I was there about six weeks Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q When you left where did you go A To a lodging in Queen-street—I have been out of a situation ever since—I have waited in the Minories—I have a husband—I spoke of this to the person I lodge with but I did not give information to the office WILLIAM POCOCK police-sergeant F 14 I took Beaumont in custody at Mr Storr s auction-rooms on 4th Sept —I told her she was charged with being concerned with others in setting fire to her house in Long Acre on 25th Aug —she said I was out at the time —I went to Mrs Matthews and obtained there some dresses and aprons a bonnet and some papers and receipts and bills—amongst them were receipts for the Insurance money—on the previous Saturday I saw Beaumont and Mrs Matthews together—I saw them go to a house in Soho at which bouse Fry was afterwards taken CATHERINE MATTHEWS re-examined The 5l note produced was in my sister s basket which I took to Bow-street—I did not examine the papers I gave the bundle as I received it from my sister—they were in the basket I believe—they were in the same bundle with the other things PAUL GERRARD I am attached to the fire-engine department—I went to the bouse in Long Acre on the night of the fire—I was called about twenty minutes past eleven o clock and got there in ten minutes—I found the back part of the house No 53 on fire—the front-door was closed when I got there—I broke it open—I and one more walked in together-from what I saw I judged the fire had begun in the coffee-bar at the back part of the house—there were books burning after we had extinguished the fire we discovered them to be on the floor—all the coffee-bar was on fire all round—we afterwards noticed that there was a boiler in the fire-place and a kettle over the gas—the gas projected from a post and the kettle hung over it—I did not see any gas alight—I mean the kettle was hanging over where the gaslight—burner was—the wood-work all round the bar was on fire the back-front of the window and back of the house—the fire had scorched the shop but it had not broken the windows in the front shop—I and my companion succeeded in putting the fire out in about a quarter of an hour—I afterwards went over the premises and examined them carefully—in the first floor there was a pianaforte a wardrobe a carpet a table and chairs in the front-room and in the back-room a bedstead a bed and blankets—in the second-floor front- room was a four-post bedstead and window-curtains and some things in the back-room I did not examine the books that were burning in the bar at that time but when I was there on duty we counted them as nearly as we could and found about 538 volumes—we could not discover what they were that were on the ground—many of them were all cinders—they were in a heap on the floor—they were torn by being flung down—as nearly as we could collect them we did—I found a ladder on the top-floor against the cock-loft—there was no one in the house—the greater portion of the books were lying on the floor Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Were any of them on the shelves A Yes there were some-in all there were about 538—I cannot tell what proportion was on the floor—there were three or four shelves on the left hand side—they were more or less scorched and burnt with the fire—the shelves on the opposite side of the bar had all fallen down—supposing the books were on those shelves they would have fallen—under where the shelves were described to have been I found the books and where the shelves had not been burnt I found books on the shelves—I could not judge how long the fire had lasted before I came—the house was very full of smoke—I could not examine whether there had been a fire recently in the bar by the water being thrown in we extinguished it all—the shelves were about three feet from the fire-place RICHARD THOMAS PUGH I live in Salisbury-street Strand I am agent to the landlord of the house in Long Acre—at the time this fire occurred Beaumont owed 42l rent—she had made application to me some time ago on the subject of a lease—the answer I gave her was that we could not grant one—I put in a distress on the things that were left after the fire—they were sold under that distress for 26l 14s 6d —there are three landlords Mr John Bird is one aud William Salter Bird another—it is trust property for eight children Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Who are the landlords now A I can hardly tell you that—the trustees were Mr John Bird Mr William Salter Bird and Mr John Swinnerton Cunliff but he has been deposed by the Court of Chancery—I was appointed by the Court to receive the rents and Mr Cunliffe was to sign a document MARLOW SIDNEY I am one of the attorneys for the prosecution—I served a notice on Beaumont on 14th Sept to produce on this trial a policy of insurance effected with the Westminster Fire-office and also a certain agreement on a 3d stamp MR CUTLER I attend from the Westminster Fire-office—this insurance was effected at our office—this is the book in which the entry of insurance is made GEORGE STEPHENSON I was a clerk in the Westminster Fire-office when this entry in this book was made—the sum insured was 400l —it was first effected on the 26th January 1838 in the name of Hannah Beaumont who was the prisoner s mother—here is in this book an assignment of it to the prisoner on 25th Jan 1845—this indicates that the interest was vested then in Mary Ann and Emma Beaumont—I should suppose that assignment was made on the policy MR CUTLER re-examined I made this entry of the assignment of this policy—I cannot say at the present moment whether I had the policy before me or whether I saw it—the course of business is to enter the assignment on the policv which is brought at the time—I cannot say whether I have seen Beaumont at the office—supposing the policy to be lost or destroyed the effect of the entry in our book would be to pay the person whose name appeared on the entry—it is the practice of the office to endorse assignments on the policy and to record in their book the fact of that assignment—we do not give any deed of assignment or any separate paper—the policy stood in the came of Hannah Beaumont and we had instructions to transfer it to Mary Ann Beaumont and Emma Beaumont—that was on the 25th Jan 1845—the premium was paid and the policy was transferred from Hannah Beaumont to Mary Ann Beaumont and Emma Beaumont—on the payment of another premium on 10th Feb 1847 it was transferred to Emma Beaumont alone—this receipt— looking at one is in my writing No 81384— Miss Emma Beaumont to insurance of 400l on goods received 1l 1s 6d for premium and duty —Mr John Hill is one of the proprietors of the Westminster Fire-office—Mr Benjamin Elam is another and there are other proprietors Cross-examined by MR CHARKOCK Q How do you know Mr Hill is a proprietor A From his signature in our books—they are signed by John Hill and Benjamin Elam GEORGE STEPHENSON re-examined This entry was made on 22nd Feb 1838—Mr Elam is a proprietor but he is not a director at present—Mr John Hill was also a director at that time HENRY O BRIEK I acted as clerk to the Magistrate at Bow-street when the examination of the witnesses in this case took place—after the examination Fitzgerald was asked if she desired to say anything—it was explained to her that if she did it would be given in evidence against her—I took down what she said from her lips—this is it— reads— From the time I entered Miss Beaumont s service Miss Beaumont kept me a prisoner She told me that she was highly indebted and that she was talking to Baxter about setting the house on fire She would not let me speak to Mrs Moore at all I gave her warning to leave she would not take my warning she knew that I was very easily led and she began to flatter and coax me to stay with her She told me she was going to Australia with Baxter and her brother that she would get a farm and land there with her insuring-money and that if I wished it I should go with her I refused to go She used to go down and speak privately with Baxter they talked very seriously together for about three weeks Miss Beanmont has asked me to open the feather-beds and two of them I opened for her and filled bolsters and pillows with the feathers and I pawned them two or three at a time by her direction I pawned some of them at first in the name of Smith and the others she told me to pawn in my own name bat that I was to give a wrong address I pawned a great many dresses china and other things for Miss Beaumont I took out a great many boxes and bundles for her I showed Baxter the money and the duplicates for most of the things I pledged She sent me up stairs to coax Baxter to set the house on fire and to tell him that if he would go to Australia with her she would marry him when she got there About two days before the fire I brought down two bedsteads by Miss Beaumont s direction and I assisted her in chopping it up She said she wanted to set fire to four places to destroy the whole house On the Thursday before the fire happened Miss Beaumont spoke seriously to him about it and it was agreed that the house should be set on fire that night He went away and when he was gone Miss Beaumont sent me for a 3d stamp She told me to go for Baxter and she said she wished me to be a witness that she gave him 3l to set the house on fire that night I went for Baxter and I showed him the stamp and told him that he was to have 3l and that he was to sign his name to that He said he would not du it for 50l When I canie back the prisoner Fry was in the coffee-room and when Miss Beaumont came in she said she was going to the Haymarket Theatre with Fry and that Baxter was going to set fire to the house then When Baxter told me he would not have anything to do with it I made myself perfectly agreeable to him When Fry came into the bar she blew out the candle and lowered the gas She then went out to the Haumarket with Fry and then Baxter told me he would not do it for 50l and that he would go off into the country and he did go She returned home about half an hour after going away Her brother was in the coffee-room She told me that Fry had left her and that she felt miserable and that thinking the house was on tire she came out to see how the place was getting on She staid looking out for Baxter till half-past twelve o clock and then told me he had acted very wise not to do it that night because it was the Opera night She then said she would do it herself if she could not get any one else to do it The next morning she sent me to look for Baxter I found Baxter s late master Mr Davis and he came up and saw Miss Beaumont and told her that he Baxter had gone into the country with a young man hopping Miss Beaumont then told me that she would try and get the prisoner Fry to do it He Fry came and had break-fast that morning and she told him how Baxter had served her and then said she would give him Fry 20l and me 20l if we would do it and we both refused She then persuaded Fry to put his name to the stamp and she put her own name to it and she made rue put my mark to keep the secret She read it over The words in that paper are the same I gave Mr Storr She wished Fry to sleep in the house He refused I heard Fry say to Miss Beaumont If you get 3s worth of gunpowder and put it in a paper that will blow the house up She said Would not turpentine do better In the evening she told me she was going to Cremorne-gardens with Fry In the evening Mrs Robinson came and she went up into the front room with Miss Beaumont and Fry and after that Mrs Robinson came down stairs and took three books and she said it was a pity they should be destroyed and she said to me Be sure to do it and do it so that it will not be known that it was done with hands I told her not to be puzzling me She said I was to be very careful how I did it I did not answer her either way She said she was frightened Miss Beaumont had told it to too many and that it would be found out The night of the fire Miss Beaumont and Fry went to Cremorne-gardens That night after they were gone Baxter came to the private door and he asked me what Miss Beaumont had said about his not setting fire to the house I told him she said he had done very right as it was the Opera night He said he would not do it for 50l I said if he did not do it somebody else would and that perhaps I would and I told him it was to take place either that night or the night after He said be never intended to do it and he went away I fastened up the doors I washed a coarse apron and then hung it up before the fire in the bar on the back of a chair near enough to catch fire There were files of bills hanging round by the fire I went up stairs to bed and was in bed about an hour I suppose when the ringing and the knocking came and I was almost smothered with the smoke I got up and went up the steps that Baxter had taken up stairs and I got out through the sky-light on to the roof and then began to cry I was taken down and I was afterwards taken to Beaumont s in King-street and there Beaumont and Fry came to me and asked me how it took place and I said I did not know and Fry asked me how it took place I said I did not know Miss Beaumont gave me three books and a writing-desk and told me that if Baxter said anything I was to join her and swear that he had stolen them I went away from her and saw nothing of her till the next day She told me to say that the dresses I had pledged for her and the china I had pledged for her were burnt in the fire and she also told me to say that the pictures she had given to me to take care of were burnt in the fire She said as soon as she got the insuring-money she would go into the country and take me wirh her She told me to say at the Fire-office that there were two 10l -notes two 5l -notes and some gold and silver in the little box that she gave me which there were not for there were no 10l -notes there was no money at all except a few halfpence that I had put in She told me to say that the satin dresses were also burnt After I came from the Fire-office we went to 53 Long Acre and Mrs Matthews was with us and Beaumont said that I should come over the water with her and Mrs Matthews said Would it not be better to have 6l or 7l than to be raking about On the Monday following I went with Beaumont to the Fire-office and from there to her brother s and then she told me that if I saw Baxter I was to snap my fingers at him and that if he said anything she would charge him with stealing bird-cages books a desk and carpenters tools and that I was to do the same and I did not see her again until I was in custody I met Baxter and he told me that he would give information and that I had better come forward and speak the truth whatever I might suffer for he was sure to give information I have nothing further to say my mistress has led me astray —MARY JANE

t18490409-1048  1048 JOHN SCOLLARD and WILLIAM SCOLLARD feloniously setting fire to a certain house in the occupation of William Scollard with intent to injure Joseph Goodchild —2d COUNT with intent to defraud the General Life and Fire Assurance Company MESSRS PARRY and METCALFE conducted the Prosecution THOMAS TATS policeman M 267 On the night of 14th Jan I was on duty in Bermondsey-street and about half-past two o clock in the morning on passing by the prisoner s shop I heard a crackling noise—I put my head to the door and smelt-fire—I looked through the key-hole and saw a light at the far end of the shop—the house is at the corner of a passage called Sugar-loaf court up which is a side-door—I went to that door and found it open—I then went part of the way up-stairs and alarmed the inmates a great many of whom came down in great confusion—I came out sprang my rattle got assistance and sent for the engines—I then returned and broke open a door leading from the foot of the stairs into the back-parlour where the prisoners slept that door was fastened by a chain inside—I could not get in there was so much smoke—about two minutes afterwards I saw John Scollard come out from a back-gate leading into the yard—a back-door opens from that yard into the parlour—there are three doors into that parlour one leading into the shop one into the passage and one into the yard—John Scollard bad on his trowsers waistcoat and stockings and his coat over his arm he came into the street rubbing his eyes and took no notice of me he might hare seen me I was near him and it is a very narrow court—I beard a cry of Fire in the back-parlour—I went through the yard and fetched one of the lodgers out and then I kept at the front-door till the engine came—about four in the morning I went into the cellar and saw the remains of some burnt wood there it was not then burning but had been lately—there was no smoke—I saw William Scollard in the back-parlour about four before I went into the cellar Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q I believe Sugar-loaf-court leads to the lodger s door A Yea that is parted off by a door kept fastened leading to the parlour which these men used as a sleeping-room—the door John Scollard came from was not the one that separated the sleeping-room from the other part of the house—I had been past the house about twenty minutes before and several times during the night as I went round my beat—perhaps I had passed five or six times between ten and half-past two o clock RICHARD HENDERSON I belong to the Fire Brigade in Southwark Bridge-road On 15th Jan about three o clock in the morning I heard of this fire—I went there and entered the house directly—the shop-door was open I went into the shop—I seat a man before me to break open the back-door to let the smoke out—I have a note which I made at the time of the state of the shop reads — Some empty tubs shop-fittings and things burnt and some loose fire hanging about under part of the stairs and partition burnt front-shop and back-parlour scorched egg-chests and some straw in cellar burnt two distinct fires —that is the note that was furnished to the Fire-office next morning—I examined the tubs they were butter-firkins there might be twenty or thirty of them they were all empty—I saw four half firkins on the other side of the counter they were partly fell of butter—the empty firkins were standing on their heads on each other and there was a little butter about half an inch thick on the heads there was a little layer of butter on the beads of the uppermost ones which I could observe the prisoner John Scollard drew my attention to that—I had asked him what trade he was and where his butter was and he said What do you call that pointing to the head of those casks—the principal part of the shop had been burnt under the stairs and some empty firkins it was not burnt through not consumed the flooring was not burnt the fire had not spread over the whole of the shop only the partition and under the stairs—these stairs started from the street-door and came into the shop—there is a recess under the stairs in the shop the wood was burnt there—the door leading from the shop to the back-room was open and there is a door that leads from the back-room into the yard—I ordered that door to be opened to let the smoke out I suppose it was shut at the time I did not see it—the furniture and the partition in the back-parlour were severely scorched—there was a bed on the right-hand side and a sofa under the window—the flooring was not burnt at all—I went into the yard where there is a trap-door opening into the cellar it was partly open and there was a great body of smoke coming from it—I stooped and saw a glimmer of light I did not go down—a man named Wilkinson went down by my orders and I went down a very few minutes after—there was a great deal of water in the cellar which we had thrown in and some burnt boards between two uprights which I took to be egg-chests broken up—the cellar is right under the shop—from what I observed I am positive the fire in the cellar and that in the shop were two distinct and separate fires—I should say from the appearance there was only fire in one place in the cellar—the flooring of the shop was not burnt—the fire in the cellar could not have fallen through from the shop there was not the least cavity—I saw John Scollard in Bermondsey-street between three and four and asked him if he was the occupier—he said No his brother William was—I afterwards went into the shop and William and John were both pointed out to me as the occupiers—I asked William Scollard what office he was insured in—he told me some office over London-bridge he could not tell me the name and produced a receipt of his insurance—I said Why you are insured for 320l —he said Yes —I asked what he celled himself—he said he was an egg and butter-merchant and pointed to the butter as I stated before—they were both present—I said Where are your eggs —one of my men pointed out to me and said Master here are some and took three out of the shop-window—I said Are these all you have got —he said I am rather short at this time of year —the fire had not extended to the shop-window—I then said Where is your butter —John Scollard said There were forty firkins before the fire happened —I said Where are they then —he pointed to the little butter on the heads of the casks—I said Is that all I could eat all that —I then sounded the tubs and found them all empty—I asked William Scollard for his policy—he said he could not find it and it was then he produced the receipt—all the stock I saw was the part of four firkins except four five or six pounds in the cellar at the foot of the stairs and that had no business there—there was a little straw in the cellar but there was so much water that I could not see it then—there was a very thun skim of butter in the cellar not thicker than a wafer there was no butter in the shop or any sign of any having been there—I made a hole in the shop to let the water through into the cellar and there was butter on the surface of that water as thin as a wafer I should think a very few pounds indeed would have made that appearance Cross-examined Q Do part of the stairs hang over the flooring of the shop A Yes I think the door that separated the parlour from the shop was a glass door but I cannot say I did not make any note of it—I should say if there was glass there it was broken—the fire had circled all round that part of the shop—the size of the back parlour was about ten or twelve feet each way or not quite so much—the bed and sofa were scorched—there was a fireplace in the room the bed was seven or eight feet from it—the sofa was the nearest not above four feet from it—I will not say whether there was a chest of drawers there or not—I examined the firkins in the shop by sounding them—some of them were turned bottom upwards—I do not know the difference between the top and bottom of a butter firkin—the parlour flooring was not burnt at all in the shop it was charred—I am quite sure there was no hole in the floor of the shop—the water in the cellar was nearly half leg deep and there was a thin scum of butter floating on the top of it—I swear that was not in the cellar before I made a hole in the shop—I had looked into the cellar—I should say I paid sufficient attention to be able to speak positively—there was not above three or four inches of water in the shop—the cellar was dark—I had a lantern—the cellar-flap in the yard was partly open when I went there—it did not fit it altogether—I do not know what was the size of the light I saw in the cellar—I only saw a glimmer through the smoke—when I got there there were three or four or five persons about the premises—I should say there was no man in the cellar with a lantern because he could not get down for the smoke—I did not go down because I had a very bad cough and could not stand the smoke MR PARRY Q Did you make sufficient observation as to know whether there had been a fire in the grate in the back parlour A I made an observation at the time that there was none—I am quite sure of it WILLIAM WILKINSON I am one of the Fire-brigade I went to this fire in Bermondsey-street at three o clock on Monday morning—I went with Henderson to the cellar-flap it was down—smoke was coming out of the cellar through a vacant place in the flap—I went down into the cellar directly by Henderson s directions and at the further end of the cellar towards the front shop I saw a flame about two feet high—it proceeded from about a dozen pieces of board or bits of wood placed on the top of each other—it was placed between two uprights which supported the floor—those uprights were burnt a little at the bottom—I had previously seen the other fire under the staircase—there was no means of one fire being communicated to the other they were separate and distinct fires—in another part of the cellar I noticed a few old things some bedding and chairs some egg-chests and two or three bits of coal—they were near where the fire was and seemed to have been burnt—the cellar did not appear to have been used as a coal-cellar—there were no signs of coal except those pieces—the flooring under the stain was charred and burnt and some old tubs on the shelves in the shop that was I should say nearly three feet from the fire underneath—the fire in the back-parlour was occasioned from the fire in the shop because the door was open—I saw four half firkins of butter on the right side of the shop and about 10lbs or 12lbs of butter in a half-firkin at the bottom of the stairs in toe cellar—I saw some empty firkins standing upside down Cross-examined Q Should you say that there was water up to your knees in the cellar A I should say not above six or eight inches—the cellar was all dark when I first went in—that six or eight inches of water was put in from the engine by me—there was no water in the cellar when I saw the light I saw none—the Tooley-street engine was there when I got there but it had not been at work on the cellar—the door leading from the parlour to the shop was a common door made of wood I suppose I do not know whether the upper part of it was glass—the flame had gone all round the sides of the shop and burnt the tubs on both sides—I did not look under the counter I believe Henderson did—the sides of the parlour were scorched by the circle of the flames—the stairs abut on the shop—it was three o clock when I got there—the place was not full of people—the firemen were there belonging to the Tooley-street engine with their branch in the shop—I did not see any people up the yard MR PARRY Q Had the Tooley-street engine put out the fire in the shop before you came A Yes—the same engine extinguished the fire in the cellar—I played it JOSEPH BISSELL I am a labourer—I occupied the front-room first-floor over the shop with my wife and two children for three months On Sunday 14th Jan I returned home at ten o clock—I was awoke between two and three in the morning by the cries of Fire —I and my wife and children escaped from the house—I saw them safe and returned in five or ten minutes—I went into the back-room where the prisoners slept—there was a policeman at the side-door when I went in—I do not know his name—I asked him to let me go in to alarm the prisoners fearing they would be suffocated or burnt so that I might save them—at the time I went in the back-room was full of smoke and fire the shop and other parts of the house were also on fire—when I got to the room the door was open—I do not know whether it had been broken open then—I went in on my hands and knees and the policeman held me by the leg—I felt the bedstead and over the bed to see if I could feel the prisoners—I did not find either of them there—I then came out into the yard—I there saw Tate the policeman and John Scollard—he had on his shirt waistcoat and trowsers—I did not see William for half an hour or twenty minutes afterwards—that was in the court at the side-door near upon three—when I saw John I asked him where his brother was as I had been feeling for them both and could not find them—he said his brother was somewhere about but he knew not where JAMES BALDWIN I am one of the fire-bigade I went to these premises between two and three o clock that was before Henderson—the fire appeared to be occasioned by some butter-firkins—I cannot say whether they were whole or broken—I went into the back-parlour—the parlour was scorched all round—there was a piece hanging on the right hand at the end of the dresser all on fire—I put my hand upon it and it all fell into tinder—I also noticed fire in the front shop—I did not see the cellar EDWIN PERRYER I am a fireman I went to this fire with the Waterloo-road engine and got there before three o clock—it was the third engine that arrived—I went into the back-parlour—it was burnt all round—I examined the bed and found it had not been disturbed or laid upon—the top covering was scorched and the edge of the pillow was blackened by the smoke but not scorched—I found three eggs in the window—I looked about to see whether that was all and found no more—I saw some empty butter-firkins in the shop—there was not the least trace of butter on the floor—that was before the water bad been let through—I did not see the half-firkins of butter—I knocked the hole to let the water through—I afterwards went into the cellar and saw there had been a fire—I saw some pieces of wood which had been burnt lying against the upright post and several pieces of wood like the staves of butter-firkins were lying in the cellar surrounded with water Cross-examined Q How did you make the hole A With my axe—there was about three inches of water in the shop then—nothing but water went down the hole—if there had been any butter floating at the top I must have seen it there was not a bit—the water in the cellar was about six inches deep there was not a bit of butter there MR METCALFE Q Did you notice whether the water was greasy before you let it through A I saw that it was not greasy ALFRED AYLETT policeman About half-past four o clock I went to the house and saw John Scollard lay down on the bed without his coat—presently he got up put on his coat and lay on the bed again—I then saw him put his arm into a hole in the bed-tick—he then went to the sofa and put his hand under the pillow—he then went to the back-door going into the court—I asked what he had in his hand—he said Nothing —I searched his pocket and found a policy of insurance a pocket-book some sovereigns 6l 15s in silver and a watch Cross-examined Q You first got there about half-past two A Yes—there were about twenty people there then—there was water but they had not got the engines to work—I gave the money and policy to Perryer the fireman who was in charge of the house ELIZA HOARE I am the wife of John Hoare—we occupied the first-floor back-room of this house immediately over where the prisoners slept On the Sunday evening before the fire about ten o clock I smelt a strong smell of smoke went down and asked if there was anything burning—John Scollard said No Mrs Hoare there is nothing burning it is all right I am only lighting my fire —he did not open his door—it is not usual for the parlour-door to be opened—he spoke from the back-parlour—they occupy the back-parlour shop and cellar—the cellar has not been used since I have been in the house—I was awoke next morning about four with a cry of Fire and saw William coming up the stairs into the upper room from the street—they were inquiring for Mr Scollard and I pointed him out—there are twenty-four lodgers MARGARET MAHONY I occupied Scollard s second floor front-room nearly two years—between three and four on the Friday afternoon before the fire I saw William go down the Vinegar-yard as if from home with a basket of eggs and again about seven o clock with about three dozen eggs in a basket—the usual time for closing on Sunday morning is just before eleven o clock—it was closed on this Sunday when I was going to chapel but if you knock at the door at any time they will open it—I have seen a clock very much like this one produced in the prisoner s room—I saw this box there on the Saturday before the fire Cross-examined Q Which kept the shop A I think it was John—he usually attended to the business—I think A Scollard was over the door the sister s name—William collected the eggs and used to go to the wharf to buy butter JOHN MAHONY I am husband of the last witness On the Saturday evening about half past seven o clock I was at the corner of Sugar Loaf-court—William Scollard drew a truck to the door fetched two firkins of butter out of the shop and put them into it and went with them towards Snow s-fields—John was in the shop—next morning I wanted to go into the yard I went down to their back-room to open the door but it was bolted that was not usual—I kicked and in three or four minutes John came to the door and I said It is a very queer thing you should shut the door on Sunday that there was many a man in the house wanted to go into the yard —he said There was a great many women about making a mess about the place —about half-past nine or ten I found the door latched again—I unlatched it—it used to be latched but not bolted Cross-examined Q Were the tubs you saw carried away openly A No I never saw an empty firkin of butter JAMES PEARCE I am a tripe-dresser and live opposite Scollard s On Sunday 14th of January about half-past ten or a quarter to eleven o clock I saw William come out of the shop with half a firkin of butter—he took it down the Vinegar-yard by the side of my shop—they closed rather earlier than usual that morning JANE BLACKBURN I lodge in Scollard s house On this Sunday I went to early Mass and returned about eleven o clock—the shop was closed then—in the evening about a quarter or half-past eight I was returning from chapel and saw William at the corner of Sugar Loaf-court I asked if he had been to chapel he said no he had been to Seven Dials—the shop was shut then—he asked if I had seen John—I said No —he said he did not think he could have been out long as he bad left the fire—I had not been into the room but I last heard their clock strike on the Friday before the fire—I saw a round-faced clock at the station—I cannot say whether it was theirs—I saw a box in possession of the police—I had seen one similar to it in their room Cross-examined Q Did any of the lodgers have clocks A Yes one or two but Scollard s clock was generally a quarter faster than others—I know it was Friday that I heard it because I was going out on business and was waiting for it to strike JOHN BARRON I am watchman to the Excise Office On 15th of Jan about twenty-five minutes past two o clock I was passing Scollard s house I heard a violent knocking in the shop as If they were beating up butter with butter pats and saw a very brilliant light—there was no alarm of fire at that moment—the police were there—I heard no alarm of fire given Cross-examined Q Did you look through the key-hole A I did not see one I saw a light underneath the door—I do not know who found me out—I was summoned to the police-office SARAH PHILPOT I live at 47 Bermondsey-street next door to Scollard s On the morning of 15th of January I was awoke by a knocking at the door and the policeman s rattle—I heard the alarm of fire opened my door and went to Scollard s front-door and saw a man I do not know smoking a pipe—I went round to the back-yard knocked at the fence with my hands and called Scollard Scollard are you awake in about a minute I was answered by John Scollard—I said Your house is on fire are you safe—for God s sake alarm your lodgers —I heard him speak to his brother and say Fire fire fire —I said My God you must see your house is on fire and your shop is on fire —I was satisfied they were all safe and returned in doors—it was then about half-past two—I was down stairs not five minutes after the alarm was given—there was no engine or firemen there then—I knew their voices sufficiently to distinguish John s from William s Cross-examined Q You were not before the Magistrate or Coroner A No they did not find me out till they had been to the Court—it was through the activity and zeal of Inspector Yates JOHN BARTLETT On Sunday morning before the fire about half-past eleven o clock I went to the prisoner s shop it was closed—I knocked at the door—John opened it—I went in and asked for some butter—John served me he went to the further end of the shop for it—there were only four or five eggs in the window where the eggs usually are JOHN BARTLETT I am an appraiser and broker of 41 Red Lion-court Bermondsey I know Mr Joseph Goodchild he is landlord of these premises and has employed me many times to levy for rent on William Scollard—I received his directions in writing and have got them with me—he ordered me to distress on the morning after the fire—7l 10s was owing for rent—I seized all that was relative to the tenant and made this inventory produced —Mr Henry Hersey condemned the goods and they were sold for 21 2s 6d —there were forty empty butter firkins sold—they were partially burnt Cross-examined Q Did you make the sale A No Mr Lloyd the auctioneer—I was there GEORGE FAIRBAIRN Bartlett put me in possession of the house on 15th of January—I remained in possession four days—the goods were sold—they fetched 2l 2s 6d —I was present—on the shelves on the shop on which the firkins were kept I saw some resin—it bad run along the edge—there was only one shelf but there was a piece of board on it—there was some on the board and some on the shelf—it did not cover the board—it was merely on the edge Cross-examined Q Have you brought the board to show the resin A No it was a deal board—there was a very small quantity there were several pinches—I know it was resin and not gum by breaking it—Yates first told me I should be wanted as a witness—I was not examined before the Magistrate JOHN PAULSON I am an egg-merchant of Ship-tavern-passage Leaden-hall-market I know the prisoners On Friday or Saturday 12th or 13th Jan William Scollard came to my place between one and two o clock with a box with paper round it and said Mr Paulson will you allow me to leave this box here till I call for it I have just brought it from the Steamboat-wharf —this is it produced —I gave it to Yates on 9th Feb JOHN SHELLY YATES police-inspector I received this box from Paulson—it contained two coats one pair of trowsers a flannel waistcoat a Dutch clock four books a table-cover a pair of braces three handkerchiefs two butter-pats two hams one pair of shoes three shirts some tea and sugar and some papers—the books relate to the business JOHN HOARE I am a tailor and lodged in Scollard s house I have made clothes for John Scollard—the last time was on the 13th Saturday when I sent him home this waistcoat at ten o clock in the morning ROBERT WILSON I am a clerk in the General Life and Fire Assurance Company Fifteen days grace is allowed to pay premiums—this policy would expire fifteen days after Christmas—this premium was paid for the year 1849—on Monday afternoon 15th Jan William Scollard came to the office and wrote this claim—the declaration is written by me it is signed by him— this was a list of firkins of butter shop fixtures &c amounting to 128l 8s —next day he brought this second claim produced and attached it to the other the total of the whole claim was 170l — The inventory made by Bartlett was here read it consisted of a very few articles of toe most trifling description —William Scollard told me that he could not account for the fire that he had left the public-house about twelve o clock and went home direct to bed that he was awoke by a hammering at the door that he took his clothes from off a chair and went into the yard to dress himself—he said none of the lodgers could have access to his part of the premises I took that down at the time—he told me that he filed the invoices of his goods—I saw him again on the Wednesday when he produced this book in explanation of his claim—he was asked by our manager in my presence what other books he kept and from the equivocal reply that he made I could not gather whether he had one or more books—he said he had other books but he could not tell where he had placed them he might have thrown them in one part of the shop or another he might have put them behind the counter or in the window and he supposed they must have been lost or burnt—we have not paid the claim Cross-examined Q Is your office incorporated by Act of Parliament A Yes—these claims were made out by him—I told him to make out his claim but did not dictate to him his things or the prices—I supplied him with pen ink and paper—I did not then know that an inquest was to be held—I got the claim from him on the Monday and the inquest was held on the Wednesday—the particulars of the sum claimed were made out by himself in his own writing—he wrote the first claim at

else there A Yes one apprentice William Adlington—he went away with me at half-past nine—we had been together all day—the other apprentice went away at five—it was dusk when I locked the place up—I and the other apprentice had been chopping up firewood that afternoon and evening—Adlington is twenty-four years old—he never smokes at the premises—a good many labouring men had been there that day—they come now and then to take a few poles away —I never saw them smoking in the yard—I went to the premises again at half-past two and found the policemen and men and women outside the gate looking st the fire—there were a few people on the waste ground out of the back houses—people used to play on the waste ground and get over to fetch balls but not since the fence has been up—I was fourteen on 23rd Aug —Adlington is not here—I lock up the place he will not—I lock it up and fetch the foreman when he is wanted—we were chopping English elm pieces of wood which were lying about—we had nothing to put on it MR BALLANTINE Q Do the back houses abut on the waste ground A Yes I saw nobody come across in that direction—to do so they would have to get across a six-foot paling—the keys of the warehouse hung up in the shop we were at work in till I went home JAMES STOCKLEY policeman K 66 I know the prisoner On the morning of 7th March about a quarter to one o clock I saw him in Cock-hill Racliff going towards the Horseferry-road about ten minutes walk from where the fire was—I watched him about 150 yards towards the place where the fire afterwards was—he was as he is now with the exception of his face being blacked—he works occasionally as a coal-backer—I could not tell by the gaslight whether the black I saw was his unwashed face—my attention was called to the fire about a quarter-past two JAMES TOW policeman K 342 On the morning of 7th March I was on duty in the Horseferry-branch-road—I had to pass Mr Adams s premises—at half-past two o clock I Was going down the hill and observed tire bursting through the roof at the end next to the enclosed piece of ground—I had not noticed it before—it takes me half an hour to walk round my beat—I did not notice it till I got level with it—I sent for an engine—the fire broke out here pointing to a plan at the farthest corner from the Horseferry-road the end nearest London-street JOHN LAWES I was in the police when this fire took place I have been dicharged since On 7th March I was on duty near Mr Adams s premises—about half-past two o clock in the morning I was in Queen-street and heard a rattle springing in the direction of the Horseferry-branch-road—I cannot say the time within five or ten minutes—I went down Queen-street into Horseferry-road and found Mr Adams s premises on fire—I then proved back in the same direction that I came—I turned up Queen-street and just before I got to London-street I saw the prisoner turn the corner and run up Pump-yard towards the fire-brigade engine-house—he could have come in that direction from the vacant ground—Pump-yard is in a direct line from Queen-street—I called to him to stop—he did not and I said Who is that —he made some noise but I could not hear what—he did not stop—he and I rushed to the engine-house—he got hold of the bell first and said I have pulled the bell and now I will go to the turncock Cross-examined Q I suppose you have not been dismissed for any good you have done A It had nothing to do with Ragan s case—I was before the Magistrate but was not bound over ray deposition was not taken—I did not say I was first at the engine-place—I was not contending with the man about who was to have the money I was thinking about the benefit the public would derive—the money was not paid to him but to me—he said Now mind I am here first I rang the bell —I could not have said I was first because I was not—I took the money because Elderton gave it me this morning—it may be a fortnight since I was discharged I cannot say to a day—it was for an assault on a civilian—I cannot say whether it was a male or a female it was a male I believe—I did not examine to see MR BALLANTINE Q Was any charge made against you before a Magistrate A Yes I was fined—I had before that given my statement in this case before the Magistrate JOHN ELDERTON I am engine-keeper to the fire-brigade in School House-lane Ratcliffe I know the prisoner by his calling me up to fires—he has called me up to four since last April for which he would be paid 1s reward which he has been paid—he and the policeman called me up on the night of this fire—one said I am first and the other I am first —they both told me there was a fire—the prisoner s face was clean—there was a gas lamp directly opposite—it was just half-past two o clock—if his face was black I should say I must have seen it—I went to examine the fire and found the premises a light all over—it is a sort of wood which burns very quickly Cross-examined Q There have been other fires have there not to which you were not called by the prisoner A Yes I have paid him 1s the first hour and 6d per hour afterwards for working engines besides refreshment—if his face had been very black I must have seen it JOHN KNIGHT I am turncock to the East London Water Works Company The prisoner called me up to go to Adams s fire—I have nothing to do with paying him I give information to a person named Edinger and he pays—during the last twelve months the prisoner has called me up on 1st April 19th Sept 28th Sept 17th Feb and 7th March—I reported it to Edinger—being anxious to get the water on I did not notice the prisoner s face this night—I have been called to five fires by the prisoner and five by other people but a different man has called me to each of the other fires Cross-examined Q If the prisoner s face was very black must you have seen it A I did not take notice—I have been called to other fires by policemen PHILIP EDINGER I am inspector of the East London Water Works Company In the event of notice being given to the turncock of a fire it is the custom of the Company to pay a reward of half-a-crown—I enter the rewards in this book— produced —I paid the prisoner the reward on 1st April 19th Sept and 28th Sept 1849 and on 17th Jan 1850—I paid him nothing previous to those—I have not paid him for this fire Cross-examined Q Have you paid other people for any other fire A Yes policemen more frequently than civilians—I may have paid the same policeman more than once I cannot say—it very seldom happens—I do not think I have ever paid Lawes EDWARD PEMBLE I am beadle and engine-keeper of Ratcliff On 7th March I was called by a policeman and went with him to the fire at Mr Adams s—just as we turned out of Grove-lane into the Horseferry-road I met the prisoner coming from the fire and took him into custody according to my instructions three or four months previously—he has once given me informations of a fire and I paid him—this is a copy from the report book of fires taking place it is in my writing here are entries of fires on 19th Sept 28th Sept and 17th Dec I have not got 1st April—I examined the premises where those fires happened MR BALLANTINE proposed to show that the other fires of which notice was given by the prisoner were of a similar nature to the one in question and different from those of which notice was given by other parties and that the doubt he had originally entertained of his right to do this was removed by MR PAYNE having in cross-examination asked a question with reference to other fires MR PAYNE objected to such evidence being given Mr Justice ERLE was of opinion that the mere fact of the prisoner s having given notice of other fires and claiming the reward did not permit evidence to be adduced upon which a presumption was to be founded that he had caused those fires Cross-examined Q Was it after notice had been given that you met the prisoner A Yes the engine was going along—we met him about fifty yards from the gate of the premises where the fire was—Elderton lives in Broad-street some distance off—the turncock lives in Dorset-street—the prisoner must have been to the engine-keeper and turncock and come back—his face was very black—I should say it was soot and not coal dust—anybody could see it especially if there was a gas-light—I have never said I should like to transport the prisoner or told him I should like to get him transported—I never spoke to the man in my life—I have said that if he was the guilty party he deserved to be transported—there have been no fires in our hamlet since he was in custody—Limehouse Church was burned down and there was a fire at a sugar baker s in Ratcliff-high way but that is in St George s—there was one at Stepney Causeway and another at Shadwell and another in the Commercial-road but they were in dwelling-houses and broke out in bed-roorns RICHARD OLIVER policeman K 186 The prisoner was given into my charge on the morning of 7th of March—I took him to the station—I afterwards went with Meedy to the place where the fire had taken place—there is a piece of vacant ground with small houses on one side and palings about six feet high on the other at one corner of which were the premises that were burned down—I got into the vacant ground—I found footsteps about fifteen yards from the premises—there was a quantity of shavings and cinder dust for those fifteen yards upon which a foot would not leave a lasting impression—I traced footmarks from the wooden fence in the Horseferry-branch-road leading to within fifteen yards of the shed that was fired—there were foot-steps as if the person who had gone in that direction had gone back again—I traced those footsteps back again to within a few yards of the paling—I afterwards obtained the prisoner s shoes and took them with me—it was then day-light—they corresponded with the footmarks going in the direction of the place that was fired—I ascertained that by placing the shoes beside the impression in the ground these are the shoes produced they corresponded exactly to a nail-another constable was with me—after we had compared them with the marks we put the shoes into the marks—there is a hard piece on the left shoe and I noticed the mark of that in the impression—the impression was deeper in that part—I measured the length and breadth of the footmarks and they corresponded—I traced the same footmarks coming back—I did not observe the footmarks of any other person in that direction we looked for that purpose—there were a number of footmarks but they all appeared to be like them Cross-examined Q Do you mean to say that there were no footmarks of other shoes in the waste ground at all in that direction A I did not particularly notice—I made I think seven or eight impressions—I have not brought any of them here—I took nobody with me on the part of the prisoner to the examination—I first made a mark beside the impression and then put the shoe into the mark to make certain—it appeared as if the person had jumped from the palings—there was a mark about a foot or a foot and a half from the palings just as a person might jump down from a fence—there is no gate there—there is no fence between the building and the place where the footmarks ceased—there is a gate leading from the building into the Horseferry-road it leads through the timber-yard there is no other gate—I know nothing of that locality—I was on duty on my beat the fire called my atten-tion —my beat was in North-street behind Stepney Church—I did not notice the trace of other persons feet on the vacant ground—I directed my attention to these marks only—I could not swear that there were not marks of many other feet MR BALLANTINE Q ou traced the footsteps along from the palings to another point near the fire A es I did not find any other continuous footsteps along that line—if there had been I must have observed them WILLIAM MEEDY policeman K 393 I went with Oliver and these shoes to the ground connected with Mr Adams building—about ten yards up the fence on the inside the part nearest Broad-street there were two indentations of feet within about three quarters of a yard of the paling—they were two deep marks about a foot apart—I placed the boots in those marks—those marks did not bear the appearance of nails—I placed the shoes beside and the impression that was made bore an exact resemblance to the first impression—that was the same with both the feet—I afterwards put the boots into the marks and found them to fit exactly—from those two deep indentations I traced the marks to within fifteen yards of where the fire was—I examined the footmarks all along—there did not appear to be the footmarks of any other person—I traced the same marks back again the impression of the right boot more particularly—the ground being harder there and the boot pressing hard on the earth the nails brightened the earth and I could distinguish the absence of one nail in the waist of the boot and five other nails pointing it out these marks were clearly shown—I counted the impressions of these five nails distinctly—I only did that with one impression—I noticed a piece of tar or some substance on the waist of the left boot—I observed marks of that on the first footmarks the indentations—I also compared the size of the boots and the shape generally—I placed them in and I found the heels to correspond exactly with the heels of the marks—I did not trace any nails connected with the left boot I did not look so particularly at that as I did at the right—the other constable kept the boots—we examined them together Cross-examined Q Were there not other footmarks on that vacant ground A Yes there were other footmarks—we went through Mr Adams s premises on to the waste ground and the first thing we saw was the returning footsteps we then went to search for the coming footsteps—we began at the Horseferry-branch-road part—we found a deeper impression there than at any other part—I saw footmarks about fifteen yards from the building THOMAS WRAKE RATCLIFF I am acquainted with the premises which were burnt down—they were in the occupation of Mr Joseph Adams—I am also acquainted with the leaseholders—they are Norman M Leod and George Henry Stevenson the executors of the late Mr Ward Cross-examined Q What are you A An attorney and vestry-clerk of the parish—I know of my own knowledge of Mr Adams being in possession of the premises—he is rated for them and pays the rates—I have frequently seen him on the premises—he is not here—I do not know what has become of him—he was not before the Magistrate—the parish prosecute this case—Mr Adams does not interfere in it or Mr M Leod—I know Mr Adams s name is Joseph—I have known him many years—I have seen him write his name EDWARD PEMBLE re-examined It was about half-past two or twenty minutes to three o clock when I met the prisoner coming down Grove-lane—he had not been working at the engine—they had not then commenced RALPH DODD re-examined We manufactured ship s tops in Mr Adams s warehouse GUILTY Aged 28 — Transported for Ten Years There was another indictment against the prisoner upon which MR BALLANTINE offered no evidence Before Mr Justice Maule 
t18510707-1515  1515 EMMA PENNINGTON feloniously setting fire to the house of Charles Wood with intent to injure him MR GIFFORD conducted the Prosecution CHARLES WOOD I am a printer and live at 19 Goulden—terrace Islington—it is my dwelling—house—it is in the parish of St Mary Islington—the prisoner has been in my service about six weeks On Sunday 29th June I left my house about 6 o clock with my wife and my two children—I believe my lodger Mr Adams was in the house at the time as I heard the piano—I returned about half—past 10 and found there had been a fire—there was about 100l worth of damage done including the house—before I went out I had gone into the two attics which were two of the rooms in which the fire occurred—I found there had been three different fires—it was all over when I got home but I saw the remains of it—I went into the attics for the purpose of lifting up the windows to allow a current of air to pass through—I left them open about two or three inches and also left the doors open—there is a grate in the front-attic and I think one in the back but it has never been used—there was no fire whatever in either of those rooms—the front-attic was used as a composing-room—there were a great many books there and a bed in which my son slept—there was nothing combustible in the back—attic there was nothing but an iron press an iron table and a wooden table and the chair which I put against the door—there was an old cotton dress thrown over the press to keep it from the dust—when I returned I found that that dress had been entirely consumed and the remains of it were hanging on the press—it was my usual custom to go out on a Sunday evening—there had been a slight disagreement between me and the prisoner that morning about her introducing her brother into the house during our absence at service on the Sunday morning—we returned from service about a quarter to 1—I spoke to her about it and desired Mrs Wood to send the brother away—she seemed very angry indeed—I spoke to her rather quietly yet sufficiently severe—to the best of my recollection the words were these Ellen we called her Ellen if you had wished to introduce anybody into the house you should hare asked permission of your mistress and myself and not have introduced them during our absence I cannot tolerate this this is the second time and therefore I must request Mrs Wood to send your brother away —she looked very angry but did not say a word Cross-examined by MR TREVETHAN SPICER Q How long have you lived there A Two years and a half I believe—as near as I can guess the damage done may amount to about 100l —there was a quantity of furniture consumed—the books in the front—attic were burnt principally bound books Spanish and others—many of them I had brought from Spain and many were presents—the beds were burned a Brussells carpet in the back—room first—floor and several other things the particulars of which I gave to the Fire-office—I am insured in the West of England—I think I have been insured evening I came from Spain which is now about ten years—I did not send in a claim for 100l —I sent in a claim for my own furniture—I had nothing to do with the house but I have reckoned that in the 100l —I claimed 80l from the Insurance—office and they have offered me 65l and given me the whole of the things—I have only one lodger and I believe I left him at home when I went out at 6 o clock—I only know it from hearing the piano a few minutes before I left—we had a character with the prisoner—I believe it to have been a false one because we have inquired and the people have gone away and we do not know where—if I were to give you my reasons I do not believe they would be considered evidence but I have sufficient ground to believe it was a false character—I only know what I have been informed HENRY ADAMS I lodge in Mr Wood s house On Sunday 29th June I left at exactly half—past 6 o clock and returned about half-past 9—I then ascertained that a fire had taken place it was over when I got home—I occupy the whole of the first—floor it is a sitting—room and bed—room—there had been a fire in the bed—room—there is a second—floor above my rooms and then the attics—I had left some clothes near my bed when I went out and I found them burnt on my return—I had been in that room about two minutes before I left the house—there was no fire in it then Cross-examined Q What kind of clothes was it you left dirty linen thrown up in a heap A Yes at the foot of the bed they were totally destroyed it was merely a heap of ashes and four rows of buttons belonging to a waistcoat—it was covered with water—I saw no matches or any combustible matter among the ashes ERNEST HYNUM LLOYD I live in Hermes—street Pentonville On Sunday evening 29th June about ten minutes past 7 o clock I was standing at 29 Brunswick-parade in Barnsbury-road Islington which is nearly opposite Mr Wood s house and saw smoke coming out of the chimney-breast between the bricks—I knew it could not be a chimney on fire so I went over and knocked at the door—nobody seemed to come so I jumped in at the window—I was not long knocking at the door I knocked loudly—I went up—stairs to the front-attic—I found the door shut I opened it and saw that the room was full of smoke—I went down—stain to the first—floor and shouted on the stairs Bring me up some water I will soon put it out —I said that in a very loud voice—I went into the back-room first—floor which is a bed-room in order to procure the water—jug and the chamber if there had been one—I do not remember whether there was any water in that jog or not—there was no fire in that room then nor any signs of fire—I went up-stairs again to the second-floor that water-jug was full of water—I took it with me likewise the chamber which was half-full of slops—I went up-stairs again to the front-attic opened the door went in and on the left-hand saw a large flame it appeared to be the bed on fire it was behind the door—I could not see it until I got into the room—I emptied the jug and chamber over that and put that out first—there was smoke in the other corner of the room not flame—I did not observe whether there was any communication between that smoke and the flame—I did not wait to look around me—I went down-stairs again and then for the first time saw the prisoner in the passage on the ground-floor—I said to her Mary Mary get me some buckets of water we shall soon be able to get it out —her answer was My orders are to stop here —I asked her if anybody was at home and she said there was no one—I then went and got the water myself and took a bucket up-stairs with me—there were two other gentlemen I think there then and I believe they went to get buckets they helped to bring water up—stairs there were two if not three—I took the bucket of water up—stairs with me and when I got up the comer which I had left smoking was in a complete blaze—there was a pile of paper and manuscripts about three or four feet high and three feet broad—they were papers of an unusally large size—I threw the bucket of water in the corner but of course the small supply of water bad not the power to extinguish the vast body of flame that was in the corner it was in a Very terrible state—I shut the window and came out of the room again and went down three or four of the stairs—by that time we had a good supply of water come up in two or three buckets and when I had emptied those I observed police—constable 229 in the passage—there were immense packages piled up on some shelves—I did not know what they contained—they looked like papers and books and they were on some wooden shelves—I sent them all down-stairs by the policeman—they were not piled up for the purpose of being set fire to but if they had caught fire it would have been a very serious thing—I did not go into the first—floor back—room for an hour afterwards—the firemen did not arrive until we had put the top fire out—we succeeded in putting out the top fire and as I was coming down—stairs one of the men said to me I want a bucket of water this front—room is on fire —I went in and found the bed and mattress on fire and the firemen in the room Cross-examined Q I believe you were in a house nearly opposite A Yes I was standing at the door when I saw the smoke—I jumped in at the front—parlour window over the area railings which lay flat—I did not meet anybody when I went up—stairs—when I got there was one fire and the left corner was in smoke—I then went down and asked for water—I did not meet anybody coming down—I did not stop to observe whether there was any communication between the two fires—when I came down the second time I saw the prisoner standing in the passage—I did not know her before—I addressed her by the name of Mary because it came first to my mouth—when I spoke to her she seemed frightened—there might have been somebody in the kitchen but I did not go down—several persons brought up water the prisoner was not one of them—I did not see whether she did anything to assist in putting out the fire—I was up—stairs and she was down THOMAS SHERLOCK I am a brush—maker of 17 Brunswick—parade Islington On Sunday 29th June I saw smoke issuing from Mr Wood s attic window about half-past seven o clock—I immediately went over—the door was open—the prisoner was near the parlour-door near the kitchen—stairs—I assisted in putting out the fire—I did not see the prisoner assist—she was at the top of the kitchen—stairs the principal part of the time near the parlour—door—I said to her The parlour-door is unfastened and you had better wait there to prevent any one coming in —there was no person there and the street-door was open and the parlour-door shut but unlocked—she appeared perfectly collected Cross-examined Q Was the outer—door wide open or simply ajar A Wide open and the prisoner was standing in the passage—I carried water up to the second-floor—I did not go into the room—the prisoner did not assist me—I had told her to stop where she was and watch the door—my object in telling her to stay there was to watch the property WILLIAM BADDELY I am a civil—engineer of 29 Alfred—street Islington On Sunday evening 29th June in consequence of something which was told me I went to Mr Wood s and arrived there at eight o clock—I knocked at the door—it was opened by the prisoner—I went up—stairs opened the first-floor front—room door and looked in—it is a sitting—room—I did not go into the back—room but the folding—doors were open—there was no fire or smoke there—I went into the front—attic where the principal fire had been—it was then extinguished Cross-examined Q Were you called to the house A Yes by a lad named Calvert in consequence of my being inspector of fire—escapes—I saw evidences of two fires in the front-attic of one in the back—attic and of one on the first-floor four separate and distinct fires—there had evidently been a sheet or dress thrown over an iron press and the floor was charred by its falling down—I was called twice to a fire in the back—room first—floor—the second time was about a quarter of an hour after I first got there—I saw no paper or matches among the charred materials—I am not accustomed to that kind of inquiry it is the duty of the firemen COURT Q When you came down to the first—floor did you go into the back—room A Yes but the smoke was so bad I could not stop I stooped down on my hands and knees and saw the bed was burning in the back—room—I am quite sure there was nothing of that sort when I first went into the room—there was no fire in that room when I entered the house JOHN SCOTT I am No 11 of the Fire Brigade I was called to this fire about half—past 7 or a quarter to eight o clock—I had to come from our station in Farringdon-street—the prisoner let me in—the door was shut—I went up—stairs and saw where the fire had been—it was then out—the things were all muddled where the fire had been in the front—attic—there were a quantity of burnt books and papers near the window and some were in the middle of the room—the window is opposite the door—the bed which was behind the door was partially burnt—I cut away the embers and the lath and plaster—before I went into the first—floor rooms I asked the prisoner if she could give any account of the fire—she said No I cannot for I have not been into any of the rooms —while I was talking to her there was a violent knock at the door—I opened it and a man informed me in her presence that there was smoke coming out of the first—floor window—I went to the first—floor—the room was full of smoke—I could not enter upright I went on my hands and knees and saw the bed and bedstead on fire and some clothes under the end of the bedstead and part of the partition that forms one side of the room was in a blaze—I called the men down from up-stairs and we put it out—the linen was burnt to a tinder—I found nothing to account for the fire—I asked the prisoner again whether she could account for it—she said no she was never nigh the room Cross-examined Q There was no apparent cause for the fine no matches or anything in that way A No but they might have been concealed COURT Q Was any part of the floor or wainscoting burnt A Yes the skirting—we cut away the lath-and-plaster—it was very hot indeed—I did not observe whether the floor was burnt where the bed was—the bottom part of the skirting of the partition in the front—floor room was wood—I cannot say what the other part was—I did not examine to find the seat of the fire my business was merely to put it out—I left men there—part of the partition was burnt—it is a fixed partition WALTER HILL JONES policeman N 229 On 29th June I went to the prosecutor s house and saw a fire burning in the front attic—it was then about twenty minutes or half—past 7 o clock—I went down—stairs and asked the prisoner if she knew how it originated—she said No she was out in the garden reading a book —I asked her if she knew where her master and mistress were gone—she said No —I asked her again and she said They were either gone to a place of worship or to St John s Wood —she seemed very uneasy and seemed to want to get into the garden by the front—door but I stopped her—there is a garden front and back—I stood at the door as she seemed as if she wanted to get away—I asked her what was the matter that she would not come into the parlour and sit down—she said She would as leave be murdered as be in the house when her master and mistress came home and she would not stop in the house that night —I asked what was her motive for wanting to get away—she said She was not going to stop there to be bullied by her mistress —I asked her what was the matter with her—she said She had had nothing to eat since her breakfast in the morning and her mistress did not allow her any beer neither was any beer kept in the house —the outer door was closed—I knocked and did not get admittance—I thought there was nobody there and went to the next house and got along the parapet to the house which was on fire but the heat was so great I could not stand there many minutes—I attempted to shut the attic window but could not—the slates were very hot Cross-examined Q Did you get into the attic from the next house A No the heat was so great I could not stand and I came down the same way and knocked at the door again and the prisoner let me in and I told her to remain at the door and not to admit anybody else—when she said she was reading in the garden I understood her to mean the back garden—she did not say what book she was reading—I looked in all the rooms—I saw no signs of any fire in the back drawing—room which is occupied as a bedroom and I shut the doors—me and Lloyd removed some books locked the doors and took the keys—four or five of us were standing on the stairs and we were met by a body of smoke which almost suffocated me so that I was obliged to leave the keys in the doors and come down—we found there had been a fire in the back attic under a press—when the firemen had got the fire out we went to look again—something was under the press which had burnt the boards for a foot in a round place and there was the tinder of linen or calico from which it had originated—I found no combustible materials or any Vessel or pan—the boards in the front attic were recently burnt—the fire had Burnt itself out—the prisoner said knew her master was insured for the lower part of the house but not the upper—it seemed to upset her that the upper part was not insured but after that she was quite reconciled and did not seem to think of anything—she appeared upset and excited—I think that was before she told me she was not going to remain there to be bullied—it was before she tried to get out—I mentioned the conversation between me and the prisoner to one of the brigade—men who is not here and he persuaded me not to let her go away till her master and mistress came home—I do not think I mentioned that before the Magistrate GUILTY Aged 19 — Transported for Seven Tears 
t18541127-46  46 JAMES LAING feloniously setting fire to the dwelling house of Samuel Glover Farebrother with intent to injure him MR MCINTYRE conducted the Prosecution JAMES WILLOW FLEMING I am acting as foreman to Mr Farebrother a printer in Bow-street On the morning of 7th Nov about 6 o clock I was awoke from my sleep by a loud noise in the house and a cry of Fire —I got on my things as quickly as I could and rushed down stairs—I found an inner door open which goes from the passage into the office—I found a very strong conflagration going on in a very large nest of drawers used as a bulk and containing papers—I then ran into the yard and got water as quickly as I possibly could—I threw it over the fire and put it out with very great difficulty—Mr Charles Farebrother came to my assistance and a young man who lodges in the house as well—we had to tear the bulk to pieces and had to tear up the plank which was fastened to the floor to get at it—on the left hand side I found another mass of fire a quantity of paper and old bills quite in a strong blaze—I found the key of the door hanging in its usual place where it had been the night before—I went down to the door and found that the lock had been taken off—I then suspected that the place had been set on fire wilfully—the Fire Brigade people came and saw that it was all safely put out—I looked round the place to see if anything had been stolen and as far as we could tell all was right—I afterwards saw the prisoner peeping suspiciously into the further window I mentioned it to my employer and went up stairs to put on my things and in the meantime the policeman came to say that the prisoner had given himself up—this produced is the lock that was taken off the door—I have the key—the prisoner had been in Mr Farebrother s employment and had left about a week or fortnight—he had left us before and been taken back again CHARLES BRINSLEY FAREBROTHER I live in Bartlett-court Bow-street and am manager to my brother On 7th Nov I was awoke between 5 and 6 o clock by my wife who said the place was on fire—I immediately got up and dressed myself and went over to the office—I there found Fleming with a pail trying to throw some water on the flames—I assisted him from the water butt—Jackson who lodges in the house came down and between us we managed to put the flames out—I then went to the bottom part of the dwelling house and found that some lighted paper had been thrown through a broken pane in the door—on the left hand side of the door was a number of bills which we kept on a file if the fire had caught them no doubt the whole premises must have come down—the paper that was thrown in was a number of the London Journals pinned together so that a person by lifting himself up could reach it to the gas light in the passage set it alight and then throw it in—I think that was the way in which it was done there—I cannot tell how the other part had been fired—the prisoner knew the premises well—he had been working with us—he had not been discharged—there was a dispute about their wages not being paid and he and several more had left the employment—some of his wages had been stopped JOSEPH GOUGH policeman F 41 On the morning of 7th Nov I was on duty in Drury-lane—about 8 o clock the prisoner came up to me and said Policeman I wish to make a statement to you —I asked him what it was—he said I am the man that set fire to Mr Farebrother s place this morning in Bow-street —I asked him if he was employed at Mr Farebrother s—he said he was not now but he had been and that Mr Farebrother owed him three weeks work which he had stopped and he had done this through revenge at the same time not intending to burn the place down but to make a smoke to frighten them—after he got to the station he gave me this knife and said That is the knife that I got the lock off the door with —he said I threw the lock over the hoarding at the corner of the Lyceum theatre —I afterwards went there and found the lock it was identified by Mr Farebrother Prisoner I beg for mercy GUILTY Aged 22 — Transported for Twenty Years Before Mr Baron Alderson

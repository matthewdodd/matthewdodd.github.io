I know his writing Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Do you know anything of the entry except what you find in the book - A No MR LAW Q Does the hand-writing of Melvill appear against it - A Yes the entry is new mark April 3 1822 James Melvill 13 Spencer-street Clerkenwell Richard Thomas BENJAMIN PRESTON I have seen the prisoner write and saw him sign this book WILLIAM RICHARDS I am weigher at the Assay-office and have been so nearly six years On the 8th of October I received from William Smith the prisoner s boy three gold watch cases to be assayed and marked - I delivered the same cases to City next day he returned them to me and I gave them to Smith - he came again on the 14th with more Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Do you attend the assaying - A No WILLIAM CITY I am a drawer in the Assay-office On the 8th of October I received three watch cases from Richards I have two of the same cases here they are for hunting watches - the other was a double case The top part of the hunting cases we call the cover and thelower part the bottom in double cases the outside is called a bottom and the inner one the middle bottom The stamp on a hunting case is a variable letter denoting the year and the figures 18 denoting that the gold is 18 carats pure which is the standard - the mark impressed on the bottom is a crown above the figure 18 on the center - a leopard s head on the left and a variable letter on the right The stamp on the bottom of a hunter would never be impressed on the middle bottom of a double case - that would be only a crown and 18 We call the flat surface only the bottom and all the rest wires - we only stamp the bottom A small bottom being introduced into large wires would denote that all the case was of the same quality it would appear as if all had been assayed When I received these cases I put the mark on them and a private mark of my own on the bottoms and wires then gave them to Richards to deliver Q On the 14th of the same month did you receive any more cases from Richards - A Yes two hunting cases and found they were the same as had been assayed on the 8th except that new bottoms had been substituted - my private mark was upon all the wires and in consequence of this the prisoner was apprehended I searched his shop with two officers and found a quantity of gold cases partly made and not marked and one loose bottom with the mark on it it had been cut out of a case which had been assayed We never stamp cases without the wires being attached to them I found the prisoner s day book on his premises - here is an entry of two gold cases having been sent home on the 10th to Mr Tyrer there is no other entry of gold work having been sent out after the 9th when these cases left the hall The weight and prices of the cases are not entered - we went to Tyrer who lives in Northampton-street and found Bellows there he gave me two double bottomed gold cases - upon examination I found my private mark on the bottoms they were bottoms of the cases assayed on the 8th - the wires were different and had never been assayed the bottoms had been transposed into new wires - the middle bottoms had the letter and 18 instead of the crown and my private mark was on them they had been transposed from the covers of hunters the new wires contained more metal than the original ones I produce the hunting cases sent on the 14th and the cases found at Tyrer s The prisoner s shop is in his yard - there is a little boarding to separate where the gold is manufactured from the silver work Bellows gave me a bill of parcels which corresponds with the entry in the book There is a bruise on one of the cases found at Tyrer s Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q I believe you have been a watch case maker yourself - A Yes The bottoms and wires are manufactured separately and afterwards joined I believe the wires of large cases are stamped as well as the bottoms if they will admit of it but with a different stamp the business of a silver case maker is distinct from gold case makers Q When a bottom or cover is stamped it can only be extended by a hammer - A Hammering or going through a flatting-mill that would flatten the mark but not obliterate it it would spoil the beauty of it The marks are perfect on these cases - I should think they had not been flatted Cases are often spoiled in finishing after they are marked they should be sent back to be remarked we should then keep them a day Q Is it not very common to put on another rim to save that day - A Never the case is always sent back Q In consequence of the trouble and expence in making a new cover if the wire is spoiled might not the workman put a new one without the master s knowledge - A In a small shop like the prisoner s I think not Whoever superintends must know it as it requires gold to do it There is no duty upon watch cases the mark is to denote the quality MR LAW Q If a case is spoiled do the Company charge anything for re-stamping - A No the damaged part comes back with it I only found two boys in the prisoner s shop no journeyman If the damaged part was not delivered to the master he would find a deficiency The cases produced do not appear to have been flattened - it is not necessary to extend it to put on a larger wire COURT Q What is the value of a carat of pure gold - A I believe about 3 s 6 d This stamp denotes that there are 24 carats 18 pure and 6 alloy every additional carat of alloy would be 3 s 6 d in the manufacturer s pocket One of the cases sold to Tyrer weighs 1 oz 12 dwts and more than half of that is the weight of the wires they would be about 12 dwts A carat is the 24th of an oz MR ALLEY declined entering into the question whether the new wires were adulterated or not the statute not requiring that proof WILLIAM SMITH I was in the prisoner s employ and took the cases to the hall to be stamped - he kept no journeyman while I lived with him which was four or five months he had two apprentices who generally worked upon silver - he and his brother worked on gold his brother had left him about a week before I took the cases to the hall the last time - I took three on the 8th with a memorandum which I gave Richards and next day I got them back and delivered them to my master and two or three days before the house was searched he sent me with two gold cases to Tyrer s - I had seen them on my master s workbench before He told me in the kitchen that there were two gold cases on the board and to go and get them and take them to Mr Tyrer s I took them off his board and as I was going along one of them jolted out of my pocket and when I got there I found a brass edge and pillow plate had fallen out I took a bill with them Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q The prisoner superintended the silver business - A Yes and his brother the gold I worked in the shop myself drawing wires there is a partition between the gold and silver departments My master always worked on the silver bench till lately he worked on the gold I believe his brother was canvassing for a situation he did not leave the house entirely till my master was taken I have not seen him since - I cannot say he has fled My master attended to the gold work for a fortnight or three weeks before he was apprehended - he had vary little to do with it till then Q Was not his brother the person who melted alloy and manufactured gold - A Yes His brother came back after looking for the situation but did no work then Before that my master principally attended to the silver he had a great deal of silver work I have heard high wordsbetween them about his brother making a mistake in the gold work I have not been to the house since my master was taken MR ALLEY Q You have not been to the house since - A I went next morning they opened the door a little way I was not let in Q Did you see the brother at work on the day you took the cases to Tyrer - A No I saw the prisoner at work on gold cases that morning washing them out - they were like the cases I took I saw no others in the shop I do not know how the brother was paid or whether he was a partner JOSEPH BELLOWS I am foreman to J H Tyrer watchmaker Northampton-street On Friday evening the 10th of October about six or seven o clock Smith brought two gold cases and this bill and about half an hour after I found a brass edge and pillow plate missing and found a bruise on one case I delivered the same cases to City and another gentleman who came from Goldsmiths -hall Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Had you much dealing with the prisoner - A Not much we have only known him a few months He bore the character of an honest respectable man I have occasionally seen his brother - I saw him the evening the gentlemen called he called at our house after the prisoner was taken I have not seen him since I have had no occasion to look for him We dealt with the prisoner JAMES DUFF I believe this bill to be in the prisoner s hand-writing WILLIAM EDWARDS I am an officer On the 14th I apprehended the prisoner I went to his house next day and found his punch mark WILLIAM WAINWRIGHT I took the prisoner into custody and as I was going to the office with him I told him he was charged with transposing stamps his answer was And what offence is that that is all he said - he said nothing about his brother Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q You did not say whether it was gold or silver stamps - A No Prisoner s Defence I have but one remark to make that is to assure you I had no kind of direction in the gold part of my business and however painful it is to remove the blame to my brother I must say he had the whole direction of that department and for the last eighteen months I never manufactured a gold case ALFRED READ I am apprentice to Mr Melvill The gold and silver work are quite different branches Mr James Melvill attended to the silver and Mr Frederick to the gold exclusively there is a division in the shop between the gold and silver benches - you cannot see in the silver department what is going on in the gold I have heard him and his brother dispute about mistakes in the gold business I have not seen Mr Frederick since my master was taken I have been to the house Mr Frederick made the cases that went to Tyrer MR ALLEY Q What was made by the brother - A The two cases that went to Mr Tyrer his brother was not a partner - every thing was done for the prisoner s benefit I remember receiving from a witness for the prosecutor two cases they were returned to me Q Were they returned to you as having transposed stamps on them - A Not to my knowledge I was not told so His brother left the house the day he was taken He had ceased to work for about a week before Q What has become of the two cases given you by the witness - A I do not know MR BRODRICK Q You say the brother left about a week before where was he - A Canvassing for a situation - he came home every night and left the day the prisoner was taken he managed the gold department till a week before COURT Q Have you seen the cases sold to Tyrer since Frederick made them - A No They were not altered to my knowledge I had not seen them since he made them I have seen the prisoner go into the shop when his brother was working on gold cases he was paid by the piece I have not looked for the brother I lived in the house before my master was taken but have been with my friends since trade has been suspended I was never sent to enquire after the brother THOMAS ELSAM I live in Kingsland-road On the Thursday or Friday before the prisoner was taken I called on his brother about a situation he was after and saw him in the shop at work I cannot say what work he was about -

t18261026-237  FIFTH DAY TUESDAY OCTOBER 31 Third Middlesex Jury - Before Mr Sergeant Arabin 2028 PHILIBERT MATHEY was indicted for that he on the 28th of June feloniously did sell to Benjamin Lewis Valliamy a piece of wroughplate of gold called a watch-case with a certainmark thereon of a crown with the figures 18 instead of the mark of the Lion-passant made with a skimp used in pursuance of the statute made by the Company of Goldsmiths in London to mark gold-plate made and wrought of the standard of 18 carats of fine gold in every pound weight troy which mark had been then before transposed and removed from a certain other piece of wrought plate of gold called a watch-case he knowing that the said mark had been transposed and removed thereon from the said other piece of wrought plate of gold called a watch-case against the statute FOUR other Counts varying the manner of laying the charge MESSRS ALLEY and LAW conducted the prosecution WILLIAM DIMES I am one of the Assayers at Goldsmith s-hall On the 11th of January Frederick Humbert and the prisoner came there to enter their mark as partners - they signed their names and their mark was F H and P M - I saw them sign their names and they brought this stamp with them on which we make an impression and return it to them they keep it and from that mark we know the plate that comes from them - we never stamp any gold which comes without the manufacturer s stamp but detain it - they also send two tickets stating the weight and description of the articles they send with their name and address JEREMIAH FULLER I belong to Goldsmith s-hall On the 23d of June I received three gold-cases and two dials they were two double-bottoms one single case and two dials - two tickets came with them - here is one of the tickets the cases were marked with the prisoner s mark - two of the cases came in the morning we take a receipt when they have any property back - here is the receipt we had that day WILLIAM DIMES To the best of my knowledge and belief this receipt is the prisoner s writing Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you ever see him write except when he put his name in the book A No I stood by him at that time I could not decide without a comparison - I have not received many tickets from him - I am in the habit of referring to his signature daily I do not think I should be enabled to decide that this is his writing without a comparison JEREMIAH FULLER re-examined Q Have you communicated with the prisoner on his writing A No I have received these notes from him On the 23d of June I weighed the plate sent to me and delivered it to Mr City the market - he assayed them and I delivered the cases to the prisoner s porter who was in the continual habit of bringing things from him - on the 26th of June I received two more cases by that porter and Mr City had them detained Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you ever see the prisoner in company with that porter A No I only knew him as bringing things which he represented were the prisoner s COURT Q Did the porter bring plate which had the prisoner s mark on it to have the hall-mark put on it A Yes Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Do you know whether that man was porter to any other house A No the stamp might have been in the possession of other persons - all I know is what that porter told me and by the mark - the prisoner s mark was the only mark he brought WILLIAM CITY I am a drawer in the Assayer s-office on the 23d of June I received from Mr Fuller two double bottoms one single case and two dials I drew them for the Assayer and stamped them and put several private marks on the wires and on the bottoms I then gave them to Mr Fuller they had the initials of Mathey and Humbert on them On the 26th I received one double-bottom case and on examining it I found the wires of it had come on the 23d but they had had other bottoms attached to them they had got my private marks on them and they were detained I went with two officers to the prisoner s house in Hyde-street Bloomsbury on the 27th of June I found the prisoner there dressed like the other men I did not know him at that time there was only one man there who had not his working dress on I first asked for them to deliver up all the cases in the shop whatever state they were in Some person in the shop showed me a tin box with several parts of watches in it the prisoner was present and conversed with me I found in the tin box these three wires and these two loose bottoms they have all my private mark on them which I had put on them on the 23d - I then asked the prisoner to deliver up his books and they were produced I found in the book an entry of a watch-case sold to Mr Vulliamy in Pall-mall and I said to the prisoner This is booked on the 28th and this day is only the 27th the prisoner said I know it I have made that mistake he said he had sent it that morning to them and had made that mistake I then went to Mr Vulliamy s who was out of town - Mr Thompson there produced to me a double-bottomed case marked by the Company the bottoms have got my private mark on them but the wires have not When those bottoms had come to me at the Hall they had come in other wires and I have not the smallest doubt that they had been transposed from them I have compared the bottoms found at Vulliamy s with the wires found at the prisoner s they have all got my private mark on them and correspond exactly in all respects here is a bill of parcels which Mr Vulliamy delivered at the office - I have not said any thing to the prisoner about this bill the outer bottom has the crown and F No 18 in the centre of it on the left the leopard s head and on the right the veriable letter denoting the year which in this case is an I and over in the maker s private mark the middle bottoms have a crown and 18 and over it the stamp of the maker it is what is called a double-bottomed hunter the bottoms have my private mark but not the wires the three wires which I did mark were all found at the prisoner s Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q When the cases are sent to you are they in a complete state A They have only to be polished the cases always fit the watches before they come there to be marked I know that is invariably the case from being brought up to the business The prisoner is a foreigner he speaks broken English I saw him at the office the next day - I do not know that he has a brother there I am sure it was the prisoner who spoke to me I had some difficulty to understand him but I am quite sure I did understand him when I stated This is a mistake this is entered the 28th and this is but the 27th his answer was I made a mistake I will not swear positively whether he said The case has been sent to Mr Vulliamy s or I have sent it The rims are not in all cases marked with the hall-mark but they are sometimes they have myprivate mark on which I cannot describe because it would defent my purpose but it is such a mark as would not be removed by polishing nor without destroying the case When I went to the shop the prisoner and three others were in their working dress and one not in a working dress ANDREW THOMPSON I am foreman to Mr Vulliamy of Pall-mall I have been there twelve years during the life of Mr Humbert my master dealt with him then with the prisoner and him and since his death with the prisoner only I once saw the prisoner at work at Hyde-street Bloomsbury I have seen him there several times I cannot tell when Mr Humbert died he left England several months ago and I think has been dead about two months I am certain he left England before June I recollect Mr City calling on me on the 27th of June he asked for a case I showed him one which I had received a bill of parcels with - this is the bill I marked it at the time I believe it is the prisoner s hand-writing but I have never seen him write - I have received this hand-writing with things that came from his house COURT Q In the course of business you have dealt upon this hand-writing A We have no occasion for any writing but bills of parcels - they were in this writing I have no doubt whatever it came from the prisoner MR LAW Q I believe you made some hesitation is delivering them and you gave them up at the office A Yes I received the bill and the case from an crrand-man who is employed by us and by others he has been employed in bringing work from the prisoner to us for about a month - I cannot identify the prisoner s work individually but the case is made in the same way that we order work to be made by that house though the errand-man had only brought work from the prisoner about a month I had known him eighteen months his name is Nicholas Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q You say this is similar work to what you have received from Humbert s house for ten years past A No the fashions vary but it has been nearly similar to this for the last four or five years - it is such work as was made by Mr Humbert s workmen before the prisoner came to this country I cannot tell whose hand-writing this is it might be made out by a clerk but it is the same writing as comes from that house the porter was employed by four other persons to my knowledge and he might be by other persons I took the case in myself from him and partly opened it and put it into a drawer I can undertake to say that I showed the same case afterwards three or four other persons might have access to the drawer but I do not think they had I put a watch into the case and I could identify that botter than the case I did not particularly examine this case I examined one that came with it no person has any right to go to that drawer but Mr Vulliamy and myself I believe the case I took to the office was the one I showed to Mr City I believe so from finding it in the drawer where I put it after he looked at it ever since the illness of Mr Humbert we have uniformly received bills in this hand-writing GEORGE MILES I am senior Assayer at Goldsmith s-hall and have made assays of these bottoms and rings which came from Mr Vullamy s the rings are about 9s or 10s an ounce inferior to the bottoms The entry in the book and the bill of parcels were read as follows - June 28th No 24 a hunting case double bottom - 12l 18s COURT Q Not only the date but the article and the amount correspond in the book and on the bill A Yes WILLIAM REED I am a constable of Hatton-garden I was applied to from Goldsmith s-hall to go to the prisoner in Hyde-street while we were taking him to the office he asked what he was taken for I said I suppose you know more about it than we do for we seldom have such things he said For lowering gold I did not know the prisoner myself but I believe he told his name to Mr City Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q He spoke in broken English A Yes - I will not swear he said Was it for lowering gold or I suppose it is for lowering gold he said What am I taken for I said You know more than we and he said I suppose for lowering gold or for lowering gold ANDREW LLOYD I ansisted in taking the prisoner - I found him in his working dress - he asked what he was taken for Reed said You know more than we do he said in broken English I suppose lowering gold he did not say Is it for lowering gold he said I suppose for lowering gold or For lowering gold The prisoner put in a written defence stating that the watch-case in question was never made by him that he had been a good deal absent from his ship and left the management to a foreman who had now left him and could not be found SAMUEL QUENDY I was in the employ of Mr Humbert but since his death I have been employed by the prisoner - there was a workman in his shop of the name of Fotex - he worked there three weeks and left a day or two after the apprehension of the prisoner the prisoner s brother who is here told me of an order for a watch-case coming from Mr Vulliamy s I do not know whether it was executed accidents often happen in finishing cases the workmen often correct them without the master s knowledge the prisoner was out collecting bills just before his apprehension it was near quarter-day and he had been out for several days very often from nine o clock in the morning if not then he went at three o clock after dinner he was not particular to the hour of returning - generally when he went out he left orders with his brother whose business was to melt the gold - he had a brother named Justine Mathey - he was an apprentice - in consequence of his doing work imperfectly it was often necessary to re-melt the gold COURT Q Do you mean to say that the prisoner did not work at the business himself and wear a workingdress when at home A No - he worked with his own hamls JUSTINE MATDEY I am the prisoner s brother and was employed as a workman by him It was my department to melt the gold for cases I remember the order for a gold watch-case for Mr Vulliamy I melted the gold on the 21st of June and delivered it to Potex to make MR LAW Q Did you deliver the gold bottom on the 27th which had been stamped on the 23d A I do not know I do not know whether that was sent to be stamped on the 23d COURT Q Are the Goldsmith s-hall to be marked unless they are finished A No JOSEPH FORRESTER I live in Princes-street Bridgewater-square and am a watch-maker I gave orders to the prisoner about the 20th of June for a gold watch-case to be enamelled - it was for what we call a red enamel and the gold ought to be of a high colour to take that enamel I do not know that it was necessary to detach the rings from the case to make it of that colour I saw a case at the prisoner s on the Saturday before he was apprehended I understood it was the one made for me but the rim was too pale it was not of the colour for that enamel and it was detached from the bottom I saw it but I never got my order from them I never saw a case of that description before MR LAW Q And what is there to prevent the rim and case being attached again A Nothing - they take the rim off and alter it but I suppose it is put on again COURT Q I take it for granted you ordered the case of a particular description to have a red enamel A Yes- the rims I saw I think had not been marked at the hall - the bottom had - there was a mark on the bottom GUILTY Aged 22 Transported for Seven Years The prisoner being a foreigner had the evidence communicated to him by an interpreter

it was the day after Good Friday - I cannot speak exactly to the hour it was between twelve and two o clock I have no recollection of the person who presented them to me - I observed he was not a tall man I entered and marked the documents in a green book which I hold in my hand and returned them to the person who brought them - the prisoner Jones was a clerk in the same department as me in the Comptroller-general s office but does not sit in the same room - I have known him since I entered that office which was about a year and a half ago I never knew him in any other office in the Customs Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q You put your name to them supposing them genuine documents A I did Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q How many clerks are there in the Comptroller-general s office A Ten or twelve - it is all considered the same department EDWARD BEAUMONT I am assistant to the receiver general of the Customs and was so in April last these two documents looking at them were produced to me on the 18th of April by a person who was rather short - I think the person was very much like the short prisoner Maynuard I am unable to identify him - I saw him for a very short time I think the resemblance strong but cannot identify him - on the documents being put into my hand there was something in the receipt that struck me a little remarkable it appeared something like a schoolboy s writing - I communicated with the corresponding clerk and being satisfied the document was genuine I marked it for payment with my initials and the date the 18th of April - the course of business after I had marked it would be for the individual presenting it to me to present it at the Treasury for payment which I believe was the case - for Croxford the clerk of the Treasury not having cash to meet it came to me for a cheque on the Bank to pay it with looking at the cheque this is the cheque I gave him for it - this receipt was annexed to the document and purports to be signed by the comptroller of the Customs when I pay a warrant of this sort I do not ask the name of the person receiving it or for whom it is received - that is Croxford s duty I have been in the Custom-house upwards of thirty-four years - these two documents are filled up perfectly regular and correct in all parts Q Are both these documents the work of one office or would they pass through two offices A That would emanate from the Secretary s department I know of no order given at the Bank respecting the payment of cheques for the Customs - looking at a 5l note after this fraud had been committed I traced a 5l note I believe this is it by the name of Maynard at the back of it but I have put no mark on it - I obtained that note from the Bank of England I think on the 7th of May I went to Lees the banker s in Lombard-street from there to Ruden and Co s Salvador-house Bishopsgate-street - I finally traced it to a baker of the name of Bristow I have no doubt this is the note delivered to me in consequence of this notice from the Bank which is attached to it - I had no other 5l note at that time it was cancelled when I got it from the Bank - I had no other cancelled note After this fraud was discovered placards were stock in the lobby of the Custom-house here is one which I took down from the officer - the 5l note No 5068 is the last of the series mentioned here Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q You think one of the prisoners is like the person but you do not swear which A Certainly not if I had met him in the street or play-house I think I might have passed him without noticing him - the name of Maynard on the note is not my writing I identify it by that name being on it when I received it cancelled from the Bank - I never had it before JOHN CROXFORD I am in the Treasury department of the Receiver-general s office and was so in April These documents looking at them were presented to me for payment on the 18th of April by a person who stated that he came from Praed and Co s house I examined the documents afterwards and found Praed and Co written across it and asked him supposing he had been in the habit of coming from Praed s why he had not put his name on it as usual and he wrote his name Thomas Maynard - from the appearance of the prisoner Maynard I believe him to be the man who presented it I had not sufficient money to pay it and went to Mr Beaumont and asked him for a draft on the Bank of England - he gave me this draft to the best of my recollection looking at it - I gave it to Maynard it was necessary that he should take the draft to the Comptroller-general to be countersigned by him before it would be paid at the Bank - I do not think that I told him that was necessary Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Had you any previous acquaintance with the person you call Maynard A Not to my knowledge I see a great many persons in the course of business - when I saw Maynard again he was in custody and pointed out to me as the man charged with this offence I had not seen him from the day he presented it till he was in custody - I do not swear positively to him but I believe him to be the man Q If you had never seen him in custody but had seen him elsewhere should you say That is the man I believe who brought the order A No because I should not notice him if I had been shown him in a coffee-house and been asked if I had seen that man before I think I should have known him MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Q Had you a good opportunity of seeing him at the Custom-house A I had GEORGE JONES I am a clerk in the Comptroller-general s office at the Custom-house On the 18th of April I recollect this warrant for 1973l being brought in looking at it - it was presented to Mr Mure in my presence it was necessary for him to make an entry of it in a book- while he was so doing I observed the person who brought it sitting on a box near me the prisoner Maynard very much resembles that person - to the best of my belief he is the person I had an opportunity of seeing him for a quarter of an hour I should think - the prisoner Jones is in the same office as myself the green book is kept in the Secretary s office - whether he had access to it I cannot say Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Can you take on yourself to say the person was there a quarter of an hour A I am confident it was near a quarter of an hour Mr Mure had to examine the document to see if it was correct and make an entry of it he had not got to copy it - he did not remain longer than while Mr Mure was so engaged all the time he was in the office Mr Mure was engaged writing - there is a railing round the first clerk s desk but Mr Mure s desk is not enclosed by any partition I was sitting opposite Mr Mure - there was no railing to prevent my seeing him I was engaged reading and examining debentures which Mr Mure was ticking off prior to the person coming with the document - we both left off instantly I did not see Maynard again for about four months - he was then in custody on this charge MR BOLLAND Q When the person entered you left off reading the debentures - were you employed doing any thing else or had you an opportunity of observing the person A I had an opportunity of observing him because I could not go on without Mure WILLIAM DICKINSON I am assistant comptroller I have been in the office since last December before that I was inspector of out-port collectors accounts - if an outport collector has occasion for money the practice at that time was either to apply to the Board or to make a statement to the comptroller-general of his account if it is found he is in want of money an entry is made in this green book producing it by a clerk in the office - it is called the receiver-general s interest book the clerk enters it and then brings it to the chief clerk to put his initials - the book is then taken to the Secretary s office what passes there I do not know - the prisoner Jones was a clerk in the Comptroller s office I found him there when I came in December - his salary was 90l a year the hours of attendance are from ten till four - he had a specific duty which was to enter the reports of the principal of the department that required his attendance daily except on holidays - I sat in another room and therefore had not constant inspection of him to see whether he was there every day when an order is made on the Bank for the payment of money by the receiver-general it is countersigned by myself and the chief clerk by power of attorney from the Comptroller-general it is countersigned before it is taken out Jones had been in the office some years as I understand and would be acquainted with the forms of the office - this order on the Bank has my signature to it I have no recollection of the person who brought it to be signed - the green book is kept usually in the Secretary s office I believe I expect that the clerks in both offices had access to it one of the clerks going to the office and inquiring for it would of course have it - it is not locked up during office hours Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How many clerks are there in the Secretary s office A I do not know - there are certainly more than half a dozen CHARLES WILLIAMS I am northern clerk in the Custom-house My duty is to conduct the correspondence with the northern division if application is made by a northern agent for money I have to obtain an order from the Board for that purpose I mark the order with my initials - there is another clerk for the western department Mr Harrison was that clerk but he was absent from the 7th of April in consequence of illness and I took the duty of the western department during his absence - an order procured on the 9th of April would have my initials I also make a mark in the green book when the document has been returned passed through my hands - I put my initials in the green book which is brought to me by the clerk who fills up the order the letters C W in the margin of this order are not my initials - they are in the proper place where they would be if the order was genuine I had occasion to make my initials several times in the green book in April - I have been in the Custom-house nearly twenty-four years the prisoner Jones has been a clerk there about five years - be first was in the Searcher s department and subsequently in the Comptroller-general s documents for the payment of money to the collectors of out-ports pass through both those offices HONOURABLE WILLIAM CUST I am one of the commissioners of Customs The signature to this document is not mine HONOURABLE HENEAGE LEGGE I am a commissioner of Customs This signature purporting to be mine is not my writing STEPHEN GEORGE LUSHINGTON ESQ I am a commissioner of Customs The signature purporting to be mine is not my writing WILLIAM GLASSFORD HEMSWORTH I am collector of the Customs at Fowey The signature to this receipt is not my writing I know the hand-writing of Mr Couche the comptroller of the port of Fowey - this signature appears not to be his writing MR BODKIN to GEORGE JONES Q I think you said that when you saw the man whom you believe to be Maynard again he was in custody at the office A Yes I was at Bow-street at one examination which was about four months after the transaction and saw Maynard in custody on this charge I was not examined at the office at all it was the second examination I was there I was not asked any questions HENRY SAMUEL NAISH I am a clerk in the Bank of England This cheque looking at it was presented there for payment on the 18th of April I gave two tickets on different offices for the payment of it and have themhere - one is on the Pay-clerks office for 1970l in notes and the other for 3l on the In-teller s office I saw the person who presented it but do not recollect what passed - the person must have said he would take it short or in notes or I should not have given the ticket on the pay-clerks for the sum I took notice of the person presenting it - he was of a middle stature and shabbily dressed from Maynard s height and age I should say he hears some resemblance WILLIAM HIGMAN I am a clerk in the Bank This ticket marked A was presented to me on the 18th of April by a person of middle stature and dressed in a brown coat as well as I can remember and there was asecond person accompanying him the prisoner Maynard resembles the party who presented this ticket to me I have no recollection of the other - I asked the person presenting it how he wished it to be paid he said looking at a book he would have two 500l nine 100l one 50l and four 5l Bank notes I paid him those notes - this book contains the entry here is a book containing the number of the notes the 500l were Nos 2536 and 2537 dated the 6th of April 1829 - nine of 100l Nos 19 417 to 19 425 both inclusive dated the 11th of April - one of 50l No 16 63 dated the 21st of March - four of 5l Nos 5865 to 5868 dated the 9th of March looking at a 100l note number 19 495 - I have no doubt of this being one of them and this 5l note number 5868 is also one Q Have you any recollection of the person who presented the ticket A I have some slight recollection of the party the prisoner Maynard resembles the person who presented it - the other was dressed in a blue coat but I did not notice him Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q Does it distinctly appear in your book that the numbers are inclusive A They are if you count the numbers you will find it must be so and they are all marked off in my book I paid him new notes with no names on them there are now several names on this note as if it had passed through several hands - it is quite in a different state as to the names on it it appears as if there had been some writing on the face also MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q There were no such names on it when it left the Bank A No I cannot tell who put them on JOHN HAWKES I am in the Pay-clerks office at the Bank and on the 18th of April I in conjunction with Mr Higman paid this ticket this 100l and 5l notes are part of the notes paid by me there were two of 500l in the sum GEORGE DYER I am a clerk in the Bank of England I produce two 500l notes Nos 2536 and 2537 dated the 6th of April 1829 - one 50l No 1663 dated the 21st of March - and eight of 100l Nos 19 417 to 19 424 inclusive dated the 11th of April THOMAS BENJAMIN KINGSTON I am a clerk in the Tellers office at the Bank On the 18th of April I paid sovereigns for two 500l notes and one 50l note it was about a quarter before two o clock as near as I can tell - they were presented by a tall thin man the prisoner Jones resembles him in point of height and size that is all I can say - there was somebody with him JEFFERY TAYLOR I am a clerk in the Comptroller-general s office in the Custom-house I discovered this forgery about a quarter-past three o clock on the 18th of April the prisoner Jones was a clerk in the Comptroller s office - the forgery was a frequent subject of conversation in the office Jones would have the same opportunity of reading the advertisement of the numbers of the notes which was posted in the Custom-house as others it was known to every body in the office that the notes were stopped at the Bank it was a subject of general conversation in the office JOHN GROVE I am a clerk at Messrs Masterman and Co s Nicholas-lane I did not know the prisoner Jones till the 27th of April when he introduced himself opened an account at our house and left 758l in gold there the whole has been drawn out since Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q You were personally present were you A I received the money from him he said he wished to deposit it for some short time with us COURT Q When was the last drawn out A On the 6th of August - the account was opened in his own name and drawn out in his own name WILLIAM POOL MANGER I am a clerk in the Secretary s office in the Custom-house I have known Jones rather more than three years when he first came into the Custom-house he was in the Secretary s department and was then removed to the Comptroller s I know he was in difficulties in the year 1828 for I was applied to by a relative to settle his private affairs I communicated with Jones and found he was in difficulties - the amount I paid for him was about 100l it was an arrangement with his creditors - they had 20s in the pound I got part of it from a relative and deducted part from his own salary I saw him in June last when he told me his wife had 700l and a piano left by a relative of his wife s residing in Newgate-street or the Old Bailey I do not know which - I advised him to invest it I have seen the warrant and receipt - in the way they are got I should say it was certainly necessary for the person to be acquainted with the method of business in the Secretary and Comptrollers offices Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How long before the 27th of April was it you advised him to invest the money A It was about the 9th or 10th of June this year I had been intimate with him about three years - his difficulties were finally settled in February 1829 that was the last payment I made - the money was advanced him by a gentleman moving in a respectable sphere of life and of some opulence MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Would the gentleman that advanced the money allow it to pass through his own hands or did he give it to you A He gave it to me - he had no communication with the prisoner himself JOHN DEAN I live in Wilmot-street Brunswick-square On the 25th of April the prisoner Jones bought a piano-forte of me and paid me 17l in sovereigns for it WILLIAM DWELLY I am an irommonger and live in Tottenham-court-road In April last the prisoner Jones wife bought some things of me - she represented herself as his wife I only knew where Jones lived from what she told me - I delivered the articles at No 6 Somer s-town-terrace I saw the person who bought them and the landlord and landlady of the house who were with her at the time the purchase was made these are the bill and receipts given looking at them - she paid me about 16l I think in gold CHARLES SAVILL I am in the service of Evans and Dry linen-drapers of Tottenham-court-road In April last I sent some goods to Somer s-town-terrace I do not know the number - looking at a bill this is the bill and receipt for the goods I sent - it is in my writing the porter was paid for them - it was 11l 7s 8d he paid the money to my master - I cannot say whether it was notes or gold CHARLES BROWN I keep a china and glass shop in Tottenham-court-road In April last I sold some goods to a Mrs Jones - they were sent to No 6 Somer s-town-terrace I received 6l 12s for them ANTHONY WAGSTAFF I am a furniture-broker and live in Castle-street Long-acre In April last some goods were purchased of me in the name of JOnes by an elderly man and woman and a young woman - I sent them I think to Marchmont-street Somer s-town these are the bills and receipts I gave for them - one is made out by me and the other by my man the 24th of April was the time most of the goods were purchased - my man received 31l 9s and I received 5l this receipt enables me to say that it was on the 27th of April - here are two bills and two receipts Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q The only thing that is in your hand-writing is one receipt A Yes and that is dated the 27th of April MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Q Do you know from your own recollection that the other goods were sold before that day A Yes - the bill and receipt is made by my shopman WILLIAM SALMON I am a Police-officer and apprehended the prisoner Jones on Thursday the 13th of August - a person named Bull pointed him out I did not know Jones at the time - I afterwards ascertained what his name was and where he lodged I did not take him at his lodgings - we had previously made inquiries and found he lodged at No 59 Judd-street I searched what I supposed to be his lodging there - I left him with Bull at a public-house while I went to search I do not think I spoke to him about his lodgings but I went there with his wife who was present when I apprehended him at the search I found all these papers there and marked them - I did not show them to him COURT Q Did you know it was his wife except from what she told you A I did not - she said nothing in his presence we would not allow them to speak GEORGE WATSON WOOD I am in the service of Mr Hamlin jeweller of Princes-street Coventry-street On the 10th of August I remember the prisoner Jones coming to purchase some jewellery - I think it was near eleven o clock he was dressed in a frock-coat - I do not recollect the colour he had mustachios which he has not now- he asked to see some necklaces which I showed him they were too expensive for him he then asked to see some ear-rings and lockets which were shown him - he agreed to purchase jewellery to the amount of 6l 14s and tendered me a 100l note in payment I called Mr Bull the clerk - he gave it to him I have no doubt of his being the man Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you see any note yourself A I did and should know it again looking at it this is it - here are a number of names which were all on it at the time except one which he wrote himself I think three different names were on it when he gave it to me to the best of my recollection the note is in the same situation as when he gave it me except his own name being on it MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q What name did he put on it A William Arrowsmith Green Dragon-lane rowgate JAMES BULL I am a servant to Mr Hamlin I remember this note being given to me to change the prisoner Jones is the person I am certain - when it was handed to me I requested him to put his name on the back of it for I was not satisfied about the note as well as his appearance I sent it to the banker s for change - the prisoner walked about the shop while it was gone to the banker s he walked out walked in again and asked for the change - I told him we had not received it and I had sent to the banker s for it he said he could not wait for the change he would write a letter for it - we afterwards sent the note to the Bank I saw the prisoner write this name on it - I am sure this is the note I got information from the Bank that it had been stopped - I was out with Salmon looking for him two or three times we found him in Hadlow-street Brunswick-square near Judd-street - I knew him immediately and laid hold of him he was dressed very different to when he came to our house - he had a blue coat buff-waistcoat gilt buttons black handkerchief and had a new silk umbrella in his hand at our shop he had an old blue coat much worn an eye-glass and a cotton umbrella - he had a pair of mustachios which he had not got when he was taken up Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q On what day did you sell him the jewellery A On the 10th of August - Salmon took him two or three days afterwards COURT Q Did you address him by any name A Yes - I said Mr Arrowsmith you have not got your mustachios on how is that WILLIAM POOL MANGER I never saw Jones wear mustachios JOHN COX I keep the Blackmoor s Head in Whitcomb-street I saw the prisoner Jones at my house on Monday I think the 10th of August - he came and called for a glass of ale a sheet of paper and a pen and ink he wrote a note turned to the bar and asked for a wafer which I gave him - he went out returned again and asked if I could find a person to take a note for him I got him a man named Ferguson - he gave a note to Ferguson and went out at the time Ferguson did he told him in my presence to take the note as directed to obtain a parcel and carry it for Mr Arrowsmith to the Bull and Mouth Regent-circus Piccadilly - he was to inquire for a Mr Arrowsmith and if he was there to give him the parcel he came back in about ten minutes - Ferguson had not returned he told me he would send a Temple porter to my house for the parcel and I was to take care of it till the Temple porter came for it Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Who is the man that did all this A The prisoner Jones I have no doubt he is the man - I certainly did doubt at first I named another person at Bow-street as the man but I had not seen Jones then - I recalled it almost directly Q Now did you not look round as attentively as you chose and say you could not see the man A I looked round the office and saw a man I thought resembled him but I had not seen Jones then I did state I did not see the man Q Was not Jones at that time in the office as conspicuous as any other A He was I did point another man out - I was on my oath at that time I cannot recollect but I think some one did tell me to look round again - I have no doubt of it my attention was directed to the part of the room Jones was in - I selected Jones the moment I saw the man I pointed to - no person pointed to him I think I was directed to the part of the room he stood in - he was about two yards from me the man I first pointed out was about the same distance - I thought the other man resembled the features at the moment I looked round I had not then seen Jones - I certainly thought he was the man MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q It turned out you were mistaken A I was I was agitated in giving evidence- I am sure the man told Ferguson he must go for a parcel to Hamlin s and he said he was to bring it to the Temple he had no mustachios on when he wrote the note EDWARD FERGUSON I was sent with a note from the the Blackmoor s Head to Hamlin s it was on a Monday and I think the 10th of August the person told me to go to Mr Hamlin s Princes-street and bring a parcel from there to the Blackmoor s Head to him - I did not see him more than once till I saw him at Bow-street I knew him again immediately - that is the man pointing to Jones -I took the note to Hamlin s and left it there this is it - looking at it - I believe this to be the same Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q You did not know the person before A No when I saw him again he was in custody - Cox was at Bow-street with me he spoke to the man before I did - I saw him point to a man but which man it was I do not know I went into the office Jones looked round at me directly - Cox had sworn to him before I did I should not have sworn to him without being positive - I had only seen him once before but that was for a long time he wrote the letter in the room - I saw him at Bow-street on the Friday week following I do not think Cox saw him so long as I did - he was talking to him when he called me to take the letter MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did you know the man immediately you got into the office A Yes JAMES BULL This is the note the witness brought read Mr Hamlin Bridges-street Mr Hamlin is requested to send to Mr Arrowsmith by bearer the jewellery taking care to enclose the money JACOB BEDWIN I am a watchman at the Temple and act as a porter but have not a badge - I have known Jones about six years and cannot be mistaken in his person He came to me on the 10th of August about one o clock just as I was going to dinner and said he wanted me to go with him - I crossed the Temple with him he said he wanted me to go to Whitcomb-street to fetch a parcel from a public-house - he did not know the house we walked together towards Whitcomb-street - before we got there I asked if he had any note for me to fetch the parcel with he said No - I said I cannot think of fetching it without you give me a note for it we went into the Coach and Horses near the New Church in the Strand - he wrote a note there in my presence and put the name of Arrowsmith at the bottom of it we went out together - when we got to St Martin s Church he said Bedwin I don t wish you to leave this note I said What is to indemnify me or the landlord Mr Jones I hope you are not going to bring me into a scrape about this parcel for I was never brought to justice in my life for any thing I went on with him - he went within four or five yards of the house with me and pointed out to me the Blackmoor s Head in Whitcomb street - I gave the note to the landlord but did not get the parcel I went back to Jones and told him the parcel was not come that the publican had sent to Mr Hamlin for it they said the man who packed it up was not in the way and they did not know when he might be - Jones told me to stop for the parcel and gave me 6d to get some drink with and take it to the Bull and Mouth Regent-circus - this passed in Whitcomb-street where he had been waiting for me I went back to the public-house - the landlord spoke to me and seeing the name of Arrowsmith - I did not stop but went home I saw no more of Jones - note read Please to give the bearer a messenger from the Temple whatever was brought from Mr Hamlin for Mr Arrowsmith 10th of August THOMAS FINCH I am a shoemaker and have known the prisoner West five or six months -

I got a clue to him and in consequence of information I watched another house inSalisbury-street New North-road Hoxton it was about the beginning of August I think when I began to watch- I know Maria Jennings she passes as Maynard s wife and was living at the house at Hoxton - West was also living there with Mrs West and two of Maynard s children while I was watching I frequently observed West come out and the women also - on the 27th I saw some man come there whom I had not seen previously on the 28th I saw some goods brought out of the house and go away in a cart - after this I saw a hackney-coach brought up to the door by West some boxes were put into it -Mrs West Maria Jennings and the two children got in West remained with the coach till they got in there were three or four large boxes and a trunk among them- West then came into the New North-road the coach that had taken the women up then came into the road and West got into it -

I saw him open this I did not at the moment he opened it see it contained notes nor till after he had opened other letters - after he had opened all his letters I took them and found these under the respective covers I can swear these three notes were in this letter because the numbers correspond with those mentioned in it -

when we pay notes for foreign coin we make a point of getting them from the Bank I most likely paid these notes for bullion but it might be for other things JOHN BRYANT PRIESTMAN I am clerk to Smith and Payne I paid this cheque on the 24th of August in a 200l bank note and two 40l looking at three notes found on the prisoner West - these are three of the notes I paid The warrant and receipt were here put in and read Jones Defence written My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - I labour under the infirmity of very considerable deafness which almost incapacitates me from hearing the details of the proceedings in Court upon this most serious occasion when every earthly interest is at stake and even my life is placed in jeopardy but I leave myself in perfect confidence in the hands of my counsel being satisfied as I can confidently and solemnly assert myself innocent of the offence of either forging or uttering the document in question and that I either directly or indirectly counselled assisted or afforded any assistance in the fabrication that no evidence can be produced to connect me in any way with a transaction of which in truth I had no knowledge - I therefore leave my case to the discrimination and humanity of the Court and Jury satisfied that a verdict against me will not be pronounced upon suspicions that have no foundation or circumstances which lead to no satisfactory proof of guilt on my part Maynard s Defence I know nothing of the transaction- I never had any thing to do with it in any shape or way whatever West s Defence I have no knowledge of the circumstance JOHN BAILEY I keep the Globe Borough-road I have known Bushel about two years and have seen him at my house frequently as a customer he has been in the habit of meeting people at my house for the purpose of procuring bail for them - I have heard him say to the people What men do you want we have them from 20l to 1000l - I do not know how he was paid for this I certainly would not believe him on his oath from what I know of his character MR BOLLAND Q What reason have you for not believing him on his oath A I have heard him when an observation has been made say for so and so he would take an oath to such a thing - I think he is that character he is not to be taken on his oath I have heard him state on many trifling things which I knew to be false that he would make an affidavit of it - he frequented my house and I knew his affairs pretty well Q How A I know he is a good for nothing man and I think he would take any man s character away for 5s - that is my reason for not believing him MR ADOLPHUS Q You have heard him say for so and so he would make an affidavit what do you mean A Why if a man wanted him to say he was in such a place on such a day I believe he is the man that would do it I have heard him say so - I have seen enough of him to know him PETER GEORGE MC EVOY I am a dealer in yeast I have been under government and have a pension I know Bushel - I have no malice against him nor have I quarrelled with him I had some conversation with him after he had been to Bow-street - he told me if he could swear so as to convict West he should get 50l - that if he could not convict him he should get a guinea a day for his trouble and he said D-n my eyes if I won t swear above a bit that if he got the money he would leave the Borough-road to be d-d that he was short of money and not particular - this was last Tuesday week I have known him seven or eight months and declare I would not believe him on his oath MR SHEPPARD Q Where was this A In the parlour of the house I lodge at he was a customer and came at times - he did not come by invitation not latterly when I found what he was - he did not say this to me alone there were other persons in the room - I do not know who they are I was subpoenaed to come here last Saturday he said this after he had given his evidence at Bow-street - I lodge at Bailey s public-house I have seen West and Maynardthere two or three times - I do not know that I have seen Maynard there above twice I never saw them together to my knowledge MR ADOLPHUS Q He came into the parlour and you being a parlour customer went in likewise A Yes this conversation was quite voluntary on his part - I sent the next day to tell West of it COURT Q You say there were several people there A Yes Bailey was not there AMBROSE PARISH I am clerk to Mr Hewit in the office of the King s Bench prison and have been there about seventeen years I have known Bushel at least ten or twelve years - he has been about the place assisting prisoners and I believe at times getting bail for them I have not had much opportunity of judging of his character for I never associated with him - I should not myself consider him a person to be believed on his oath MR BOLLAND Q Now why do you come to say you would not believe him on his oath A I speak in general terms - I do not mean to say he is not to be believed I only know him about the prison - I had nothing to do with him MR ADOLPHUS Q Have you seen him in particular societies and with particular persons A I have seen him almost daily - he seldom or ever goes into the prison it does not fall within my department to know what he is employed in about there CHARLES CHADWICK JONES I am a special pleader - my chambers are in Serjeant s Inn Fleet-street and my house at Pimlico I know Bushel unfortunately and certainly would not believe him on any oath he would take MR SHEPHERD Q For what reason would you not believe him A Because he has obtained money from me on several occasions on promises which he never performed and which I believe at the time he never intended to perform MR BODKIN Q Have you any other reason A He has told me that he was a common procurer of bail and would swear any thing if he was paid for it MR SHEPHERD Q On what occasion has he made this declaration to you A I was some time ago arrested for 500l by a person calling himself Jonathan Clark - I indicted the man for perjury for I did not know him and never owed him the money subsequent to my indicting him Bushel and another man came and said they would point out the person who had arrested me - Bushel came repeatedly saying he could point out the person who arrested me and he has on different occasions obtained from a shilling to a sovereign he and Brook came to me one afternoon and said We have found the man and if you will appoint your officers to be at Spa-fields he shall be taken I went with the officers - Brook pointed out a man named Wild Bushel was there Wild was taken and confined two nights in Giltspur-street and on Monday morning two persons calling themselves attornies swore positively he was not the man he was consequently discharged and I had an action brought against me - when Brook pointed the man out Bushel said that was right Wild was first taken to Marlborough-street and at a public-house there Bushel and Brook obtained from me another sovereign I have come here with great reluctance in consequence of being subpoenaed this afternoon JURY to EDWARD BEAUMONT Q Is the receipt said to be written by West a peculiar form of office or is it a common receipt which could be written by an uninformed person A It is written according to the usual form it might be worded different and yet would be paid but I should require it to be signed by the collector and it must be transmitted with the warrant JURY to JAMES JOHN SMITH Q After seeing these people get into the coach where did you go A To the Bull and Mouth I got there about one o clock on Friday the 28th of August set off that night by the mail and got to Taunton about half-past one o clock next day the others went by the North Devon coach from the Bull and Mouth - I am certain Maynard did not go by that coach I got there about six hours after the North Devon coach and found them together about three o clock JONES - GUILTY on the Counts only which charge him only as an accessory Aged 25 Transported for Seven Years MAYNARD -

t18300916-155  Before Mr Justice Bosanquet 1620 JOHN WORMERSLEY was indicted for feloniously forging counterfeiting &c a certain deed sealed setting it forth as follows - Purporting to be a power of attorney from Henry Lowry of Brentwood Essex auctioneer appointing John Wormersley late of Little Suffolk-street Borough but now of Lant-street hat-manufacturer his attorney to receive 103l 5s 1d from the Accountant-General of the Court of Chancery pursuant to an order made the 7th of August 1827 in the cause Detillin and Gale - dated 2nd of August 1828 and attested by George Dering of New Broad-street London and John Willis coal-merchant of East-lane Walworth With intent to defraud John Springett Harvey Esq Accountant-General of the Court of Chancery and JOHN WILLIS was indicted for inciting procuring aiding and counciling the said John Wormersley to do and commit the said felony 2nd COUNT calling the instrument a letter of attorney 3rd and 4th COUNTS like the first and second only stating the intent to be to defraud Ann Wallis EIGHT OTHER COUNTS for uttering and publishing the same as true with intent to defraud different persons and charging Wilson as an accessary MESSRS GURNEY and ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution JOSEPH BICKNELL I attend from the Six Clerks office in the Court of Chancery I produce a bill filed in the cause of Detillin v Gale JOHN REED I am a clerk in the Register s office and produce an original order made by the Vice-Chancellor in the cause Detillin and Gale Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Has it been passed and entered A Yes it has my signature to it and the seal of the office - I know the Register s handwriting This was an order to pay to Henry Lowry of Brentwood Essex since deceased or to his legal representative the sum of 103l 5s 1d for goods sold and delivered by him to Philip Detillin WILLIAM DANIEL KISS I am a solicitor and know the prisoner Wormersley before July 1828 he had employed me as attorney and solicitor Henry Wormersley the petitioner in this cause is his father and he has a brother Henry On the 16th of July 1828 he gave me directions to apply at the Accountant-General s office to bespeak two powers of attorney in the cause Detillin and Gale - he went with me to the office and they were bespoke he desired me to apply for one in the name of Henry Lowry for 103l 5s 1d and the other in the name of Charles Gatland - I bespoke them in his presence the instructions for them are in his hand-writing - the powers are filled up by the clerks in the office JAMES SELSRY I am clerk to Mr Kiss I received these papers from the office after Mr Kiss had bespoke them this is the affidavit looking at it the power is annexed but there is no mark on it for me to identify it - at the time I received it the power and affidavit were annexed similar to this Wormersley came to Mr Kiss s office to me - I said Wormersley you may as well give me a ride into the country to go and see these executed - there were two at the time the power was filled up but not executed the affidavit was not sworn - the affidavit is an engraved form - it was delivered out with the power and filled up except the signature his answer was that the parties were too poor - he said You lawyers will not do business for nothing I have a friend or person who will and you may as well put the name in the affidavit I then inserted in the affidavit the name he gave me - here it is in my handwriting - John Willis of East-lane Walworth in the parish of St Mary Newington Surrey coal-merchant I also wrote the jurat except the date - I then delivered to him the power of attorney and affidavit annexed I have seen Wormersley write - I cannot say that the signature H Lowry to the power is Wormersley s handwriting there is a similarity of style - I should be very loath to say I believed it to be his if asked whether I believed it to be his I should say to satisfy myself I do not here is 6th August in the jurat of the affidavit - I believe that to be his hand-writing I never saw the papers after he took them away Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q If asked distinctly whether you could form a belief of the hand-writing and you were forced to say you would say you did not believe it to be Wormersley s A Yes I do not undertake to say that is the power he took away - the affidavit is only pinned to it and could be transferred to any other power a person having the affidavit could easily fill up the power the same as this if they obtained the form from the office - I had known Wormersley a few months and knew his residence he was not taken up for two years after the transcation I continued to know him down to the latter end of 1829 and did business for him - I could have read the order on which the affidavit was made if I had chosen out did not he was about publicly and I understand was apprehended at his own factory - I knew him at his own house which is a short distance from the factory he was accessible to me Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Wormersley s father was in some manner concerned in the suit in Chancery A I understood so but we were not engaged in that suit in any way I have been sixteen years with Mr Kiss but never saw Willis till he was at Bow-street on this charge - I never inquired whether Wormersley had given me a true description of Willis the attesting witness I have frequently attested deeds - nothing is more common than for a person to be called in to witness the signature to a paper by the party purporting to be the person signing it I have had letters from persons stating themselves to be the parties and have then witnessed their signatures - I should certainly ask them if they knew the nature of the business MR GURNEY Q Should you in such a case take care to ascertain whether the party was the person he represented himself to be A Certainly - I delivered the same affidavit and paper to Wormersley as were delivered to me at the Accountant-General s office by Mr Giles the clerk MR KISS re-examined On the 15th of August the prisoner Wormersley called on me again he said he calledto request me to accompany him to the Accountant-General s office to identify him and to receive the cheques - I was to identify him as the attorney named in the power of attorney which he said he had had from my office and which he told me was then in the Accountant-General s office I accompanied him to the Accountant-General s office in Chancery-lane Middlesex - he inquired of Mr Parkinson the clerk for the cheques in the matter of Lowry and Gatland in the cause Detillin and Gale he appeared perfectly acquainted with the business of the office - I said This is Mr Wormersley he is the person named in the power of attorney the cheques were then given to him or to me in his presence and for his use - one cheque was for 103l 5s 1d he signed his name in the book and I attested his signature - looking at the book I saw him sign this it is his hand-writing and here is my attestation receipt read - the power of attorney was on Mr Parkinson s desk at the time the prisoner signed the receipt and received the cheques - perhaps I should be more correct if I said a power of attorney Q A power of attorney under which he professed to receive A Yes - we then went to another office and had the cheque entered it is payable at the Bank of England - he and I separated at the door he took the cheque away - I did not accompany him to the Bank Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Nothing is more usual than that part of the transaction you performed A Certainly it was perfectly regular it is very common for creditors in the country to transmit a power of attorney to receive money when a decree is made but the papers must be obtained from the office - the Accountant-General has the profit not the solicitor it is stated in the order that Mr Lowry was dead - at the time I identified the prisoner at the office I knew nothing of Mr Lowry whether he was dead or alive or I should have known the power to be forged if the clerk who prepared the power had referred to the decree he must necessarily have discovered that he was doing wrong Q And the prisoner if acting criminally must have known he was going to the very place of all others where he must necessarily have been discovered A He must- the order is dated the 7th of August 1827 twelve months before the occurrence in question he must have known the very instrument which would discover this would he laid on their table I must state that he only turned to that part of the order which does not describe Lowry as deceased - the clerks knew where to look for both parts of the order JOHN PARKINSON I am a clerk in the Accountant General s office - John Springett Harvey Esq is the Accountant-General On the 16th of July 1828 application was made to Mr Giles who is next to me in the office for a power of attorney in the cause of Detillin and Gale- Mr Giles prepared this power looking at it - it is Mr Giles hand-writing I had nothing to do with preparing the power or affidavit - they were after wards produced to me personally by the prisoner Wormersley both the power and affidavit annexed I cannot say when they were brought - I examined the power as to the execution of it- it appeared duly executed and the affidavit duly sworn - I marked the affidavit at the back R B Fo C L O it being the outside and I have marked the power with my initials so that I know them to be the same to the best of my recollection Wormersley was alone when he produced the order for the purpose of getting the cheques prepared on the 15th of August he came for the cheque - Mr Kiss came with him to identify him as the person to whom the power of attorney belonged I had it in my possession at that time in my drawer in the office it having been previously examined after I had numbered it and filled up the receipt I put the number of the power in the margin of the receipt Wormersley signed the receipt in Mr Kiss presence who added his name and address there to- the cheque was for 103l 5s 1d on the Bank of England he took the order of Court directing the payment and the cheque away - cheque produced this is the cheque in question read I put his name to the back of it to give the Bank knowledge that he was attorney - the first Wormersley on the cheque is written by me and here is another which is his signature written at the Bank acknowledging the receipt Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You have seen this order I suppose A It was an office copy of the order under which I acted I had examined the power and affidavit - I had examined the order carefully I beg pardon for saying so much but it is my business to look at the ordering part of the order and if you will read that part you will perceive that where persons are dead it says To the representatives of those persons and here the order says Pay to H Lowry my duty is only to read that part - if I was to read all the recitals no man could do the business of the office there was nothing to prevent my reading the whole - whether Wormersley omitted to read that part I cannot tell MR ADOLPHUS Q If he was conversant with the business of the office would he know that according to the course of business you never read the whole order A Certainly - the power of attorney satisfied the ordering part THOMAS GILES I am a clerk in the Accountant General s office In July 1828 I received instructions for a power of attorney in the cause Detillin and Gale I believe I received them by or on behalf of Mr Kiss - I have them here MR KISS These instructions are in Wormersly s handwriting read The order was for two powers of attorney one from Henry Lowry of Brentwood auctioneer for 103l 5s 1d in the cause of Detillin and Gale to John Wormersley as before described MR GILES In consequence of these instructions I prepared that power it was a printed form I filled in all the manuscript part except the date and the names of the executing party and witnesses - I inserted the name of the attorney in the body and prepared the affidavit affixed except the names of the deponent and witnesses- they were prepared in the office according to the usual course of business - I cannot say to whom I delivered them Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q For the purpose of complying with the instructions I suppose you referred to the order in Court A Either to that or the office copy which would contain the whole order - but I should not look at the recital that would contain the name of Lowry as deceased - I might refer to it if Ichosen I do not know that I ever saw the power after I issued it MICHAEL WELLSDON I am a clerk in the Bank of England I paid this cheque on the 15th of August 1828 - the person signed his name on the back as John Wormesley he appeared to act as attorney for some person MR KISS The endorsement on this cheque is Womersley s hand-writing THODEY SMITH I am a clerk in the Master s office Looking at the affidavit - I have no doubt of having seen this affidavit sworn I have written on it and was not absent from business on the day it was sworn it has the hand-writing of Sir Griffin Wilson who is a master in Chancery it is my duty to attend the master to administer the oath to the party making the affidavit - I attended business all that day Cross-examined Q You have no doubt you was at business A No I never am absent except when attending trials of this description and I enter my absence in a book I have no recollection of this individual transaction - it is in consequence of Sir Griffin Wilson s signature being to it that I think it was sworn and that only there is none of my writing on it - it purports to be sworn at the Public-office on the 6th of August 1828 MR GURNEY Q Were you at the office on that day A Yes WILLIAM SMITH I am a brewer and live at Walworth The prisoner was in my service a long time I have seen him write - I cannot swear that the signature John Willis to this affidavit is his writing it is like it and I think it is his - I believe it is his Q Look at the power of attorney - you see the name John Willis coal-merchant East-lane Walworth did he live there A Yes I believe this to be his handwriting also Cross-examined by Mr BODKIN Q When first asked about this before the Magistrate did you not speak with considerable hesitation on the subject A Not more than I have now I have been acquainted with him six years - I knew him in August 1828 he was working as a labourer in the East India-docks and might be so in August 1828 I cannot particularly speak to the time - he always bore the reputation of a well-conducted man JAMES REED I live at No 24 New Broad-street and am collector of the parochial rates I knew no George Dering in New Broad-street - there was no housekeeper of that name in August 1828 and I knew of no person of that name living there Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Might not fifty persons of that name lodge there and you not know it A There might ANN WALLIS I am a widow Mr Henry Lowry of Brentwood Essex auctioneer was my father - he died in April 1808 here are the letters of administration to his effects granted to me read dated 30th July 1808 - I knew my father was a creditor under the estate of Detillin Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When did the person come down A About two years ago COURT Q What persons we have not heard a word about that A A person called on me at Brentwood I neither know his name nor address - he asked if I would join him and more creditors to bring the thing forward as he was tired of waiting and then he said he would buy the debt I said I would do neither I should wait till I received it - neither of the prisoners are that person I do not recollect that he gave his name MR PARKINSON re-examined Q The power is filled up in Gibbs writing how did it come into your possession A Wormersley on its being executed returned it to me for examination I cannot take on myself to say whether he came alone or at what time he brought it - I well remember his coming with it to the Attorney-General s office and I examined it as to the execution this is the identical instrument for I put my initials on it The power of attorney was here read also the affidavit of John Willis of East-lane Walworth coal-merchant deposing that he was present and saw H Lowry of Brentwood duly sign seal and as his act deliver the letter of attorney annexed and that the signature was his hand-writing and that the names of himself and George Dering were the real signatures of the attesting witnesses Wormersley s Defence written - My Lord and Gentleman of the Jury - My father was a creditor of the estate of a person named Detillan the effects of which were administered under the anspices of the Court of Chancery the debt due to him was large and deeply interested on his account I called very frequently upon the solicitors to the estate - this produced a degree of intimacy between myself and the parties in the office and when after a great length of time it was ascertained there was a probability that the debts would be paid in full it was suggested to me by a clerk in the office that I might derive some advantage from purchasing up such of the debts as were still outstanding as claims upon the estate I never read the order and if those whose immediate business it was did not read it I could hardly be expected to do so the first I purchased was a trifling one from a Mr New of Aldgate and finding that the business would occupy more of my time than I could spare from my own pursuits I employed an acquaintance a supposed friend namely Henry Campbell to negociate for the sum due to a Mr Lowry of Brentwood - the amount of his debt was 103l 5s 1d Campbell undertook the business of arranging for my purchase of it and went as he said to Brentwood for that purpose - this is proved by the evidence of Mrs Wallace who says that some person but neither myself nor Mr Willis was that person came to inquire whether she would sell the debt due to her father but that she refused to listen to any such proposition this refusal Campbell did not communicate to me on the contrary he returned to town and stated that he had concluded the negotiation and on the faith of his representation being correct I gave him 60l for the purpose of purchasing this debt of 103l 5s 1d and furnished him with the blank warrant of attorney to get it properly executed and conclude the business in the ordinary way Campbell took the money and the blank warrant of attorney and soon afterwards returned with it apparently executed by Henry Lowry but the office at which the money was to be paid requiring a further attestation of the signature Mr Campbell proposed to introduce Mr Lowry to affix his signature in order to obtain the attestation of Mr Willis to the signature - this was done Campbell introduced a person to me as Mr Lowry I appointed a time when Lowry as I supposed was to attend to affix his signature with that of the attesting witness besides Willis The persons representing Lowry and the witness Deering came to my house and Mr Willis met them there they affixed the signatures and Mr Willis made the affidavit of attestation in consequence I had no suspicion that Campbell was dealing falsely with me Ihad known him for years and would almost have trusted him with my life for that as well as my character has been on the verge of sacrifice through his duplicity and the ungenerous stratagem by which he has reduced me to the situation in which I stand The business being completed and as I thought in a correct way I obtained the money and as it appears entered in my cash book as an ordinary occurrence My housekeeper was present when I paid the money to Campbell which she believes was about 60l and that I had some conversation with her on the business from which she gathered that it was for the purchase of a debt on the execution of a warrant of attorney but the time that has elapsed nearly two years and the improbability that her attention would ever he recalled to the circumstances has tended to destroy that distinctness of recollection which I could wish had been preserved Another person was present when I paid the 60l to Campbell but I have not been able to produce him as a witness from certain embarrassments of his own but I have a memorandum in Campbell s own hand-writing of the receipt of the 60l and this hand-writing will be produced and proved which is all I can now do Campbell not being able to be found for had I the power of producing Campbell his own life would be the forfeit of his appearance in this Court he has as the Court may well suppose consulted his own safety for nearly two years he has not been seen by any of his old acquaintances or in the places of his previous resort - in fact soon after the date of this transaction he absconded and has not since been seen in London Willis Defence written Being prevented by an impediment in my speech from addressing you I beg leave to submit to writing the following facts - In the latter end of July 1828 John Womersley called on me at my lodgings in East-lane Old Kent-road and said that he had purchased a debt and wished me to call the next morning at his house in Lant-street Borough to witness a power of attorney authorising him to receive the money I called the next morning at his house and was there introduced by him for the first time in my life to a person who he represented as a Mr Lowry the power of attorney was then placed on the table and I saw Mr Lowry write his name Henry Lowry on the power of attorney which I witnessed as also did another gentleman then present and afterwards made an affidavit of the same at an office in Southampton-buildings for doing which I never received any remuneration either directly or indirectly but did it to oblige him having known him for some time and being a distant relation - after that I never saw John Womersley until I was apprehended at Bow-street Gentlemen I have now stated to you the simple facts of the case so far as I am innocently concerned and which might have happened to any of yourselves and I appeal to you as men of business and of the world whether it is likely I should have witnessed put my own name and address where I then resided and continued to do so for eighteen months afterwards and at which place Mr Taunton the officer found me without the slightest difficulty if I had had any idea of the power of attorney being a forgery to convince you that it is impossible I could have participated in the produce of the power of attorney I shall be able to prove to you that at that very time I was in very distressed circumstances and obliged to pledge my wearing-apparel to procure the necessaries of life for myself and family consisting of a wife and three children - within a week after the money is said to have been received I went to work in the London-docks as a laboarer SARAH HARRIS I live in Rochester-terrace Vauxhall-road In 1828 I was housekeeper to the prisoner Wormersley and have seen Campbell several times at his house about the latter end of July 1828 I remember Wormersley paying him 60l - Wormersley then gave him a power of attorney as I understood it was a paper - I think it was like the one produced I understood Campbell was to pay the 60l to purchase the debt - he was to get the paper properly affixed and filled up as a power of attorney I saw Campbell again a few days after and then two or three weeks after but have never seen him since MR GURNEY Q How often had you seen him before A Three or four times I never saw him any where but at my master s - he left his name once as Campbell I am positive this happened in July - I cannot give any reason I cannot say when I was first asked if I remembered this it was not till after my master was taken up - I have been with him down to the time of his being taken up he is not married EDWARD WORMERSLEY I am the prisoner s brother I knew a person named Campbell previous to 1828 being an acquaintance of my brother s I believe I should know his hand-writing if I saw it Q Look at this paper is that the hand-writing of Henry Campbell A To the best of my belief I should say it was I have received notes from him and judge that it is - I have not seen him for the last eighteen months or more MR ADOLPHUS Q What was he A I understood he had been an officer in the army - I believe he was on half-pay when I knew him I was a good deal acquainted with him - he lodged at No 9 Hampden-street Walworth with a Mrs Whittle I think I called on him there about 1824 - I think he left there about 1824 or the beginning of 1825 I do not know where he lived in 1827 or 1828 - I have not seen him myself since 1825 MR CLARKSON Q Do you live in London A I did I left about twelve months ago but I left London also in 1824 MR GURNEY Q Where were you in 1828 A In London and in 1827 WILLIAM BASSETT I live at No 39 Bishopsgate-street without I know Wormersley and I knew Campbell an acquaintance of his I remember his visiting at Wormersley s house when he lived in the New Kent-road about 1823 and 1824 for about a year and a half - the last time I saw him was in the early part of 1828 in Cranbourn-alley MR GURNEY Q You knew him about 1824 and till 1828 A No - he was generally at Wormersley s on a Sunday up to 1824 I was not in the habit of being there after that - I did not see him between 1824 and 1828 I always heard him called Major Campbell MR CLARKSON Q Did you cease visiting the prisoner in 1824 A No but was not in the habit of visiting him so frequently COURT Q How came you to meet him in Cranbourn-alley A I met him by accident and was determined to see if it was him PHOEBE STONE I am a widow and live in Swan-place Old Kent-road I have known Willis seven years in 1828 he lived at No 9 East-lane Walworth - I lent his wife some money to go out of town with in 1828 on the 12th of May they were then in very distressed circumstances and continued so in July August and September- I found them food or they would not have had it there was no appearance indicating they had suddenly become possessed of a large sum while I knew them EDWARD CHARLES ANDERSON I am a watch-maker Willis came to lodge with me in 1828 he was in no business then - he formerly sold coals hats and things on commission I know he had failed but do not know when - he lodged with me in August 1828 at No 9 East-lane Walworth he was to be found there - I let the house in September 1829 to Mr Cole leaving him there as a lodger his circumstances were very bad in August and September - he owed me 3l 8s 6d for rent when I left he agreed to pay it at 2s a week - he did not pay me for a long while I have known him to the present time and never knew any thing but honesty about him MR GURNEY Q In August 1828 was his situation a day-labourer A He was a labourer in the London-docks while with me JOHN HARRISON I am warehouse-keeper in the London-docks in August 1828 Willis applied to me for employment as a labourer and said he was much distressed - he continued there from the 8th of August off and on till the 17th of January 1829 at 2s 6d a day WORMERSLEY - GUILTY of uttering Aged 36 Transported for Life WILLIS - NOT GUILTY

t18310512-194  1184 CHARLES CHRISTMAS was again indicted for uttering the following order viz -March 29 1831 Mrs Bailey - Give Christmas a shirt and stockings By order of T TUCKER with the same intent as before SARAH BAILEY I am matron of St Giles workhouse On Wednesday the 30th of March the prisoner came to me at the store-room and delivered me this paper I received it and read it aloud Shirt and stockings - the prisoner said Yes I then delivered him a shirt and a pair of stockings and put the paper on a file which I keep no one has access to it but myself - I entered the order in a book kept for the purpose and which I have here I entered it the same day - I took the paper off the file and gave it to Mr Twilly or he took it off in my presence but this file remained in my presence the whole time I copied the paper and have some recollection of this particular paper - I first had occasion to believe that there was something wrong on the same evening or the following one when I showed it to Mr Twilly the file had not been disturbed - I had had it safe from the time I gave the prisoner these things till I showed it to the governor - no one had touched it MR PRENDERGAST Q Where did you keep the file A In the store-room which was invariably locked and never opened but by me ISAAC TWILLY I am master of the workhouse of St Giles in the Fields and St George Bloomsbury Mrs Bailey is entrusted to deliver out goods to the several paupers from the parish stock which belongs to and is supplied by the directors this order was shown to me by Mrs Bailey and I gave my opinion that it was a forgery Mr Thomas Tucker is in the habit of signing such papers- he is the assistant-overseer and acted as such at the time these goods were delivered the assistant-overseers separately sign orders of this description and they are complied with as matters of course when presented by myself and the matron I have the charge of the men s wearing-apparel and she of the women s and the linen - the orders are made on the matron or myself according to the articles wanted - if this had been in the from for men s shoes and I had thought it genuine I should have complied with it - I handed the order I received from Mrs Bailey to Mr Tucker THOMAS TUCKER This paper is not my writing - I am assistant-overseer and was so on the 30th of March last I entered on my office in May 1830 and have been in the daily order of issuing such orders on the matron and Mr Twilly on account of the parish - if this order had been genuine Mrs Bailey would have been bound to comply with it if it had been in my hand-writing - if an application had been made to me and I had thought the party required such relief I should have issued such orders but this is not my writing nor written by my authority I did not authorize the prisoner to apply for such articles nor for any thing that day in my judgment this does not bear any resemblance to my hand-writing but Mr Sergeant Sellon thought it did I am assistant-overseer for the parishes of St Giles in the Fields and St George Bloomsbury united for the support of the poor there is no other person of the name of Tucker who issues such orders MR PRENDERGAST Q Are there other overseers A Yes but they are not in the habit of issuing such orders my eldest son is nine years old - paupers never apply for relief except at the office - no person to my knowledge has ever signed one of these papers but myself - here is the book which contains my authority to Act as overseer here are the minutes of the proceedings COURT Q Do you know the hand-writing of the chairman A Yes it is the hand-writing of the Reverend Mr Tyler to the proceedings of the vestry - read At a joint vestry held for the parishes of St Giles in the Fields and St George Bloomsbury in the vestry-room of the parish of St Giles in the Fields on Wednesday the 12th of May 1830 the vestry proceeded to ballot for four assistant-overseers and at the close of the ballot the majority of votes being in favor of Thomas Tucker and three others they were declared duly elected and appointed assistant-overseers of these parishes I have in consequence of this acted ever since - I have no other appointment in writing I was then called in and informed of the decision by the chairman Mr Tyler - the next meeting was held on the 15th of May when the minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed and signed by the chairman MRS BAILEY The articles I delivered were worth about 2s 9d Prisoner s Defence Mr Tucker gave me the orders he is in the habit of giving orders every half hour - he gives so many he does not know how many he does give I walked the streets one night and because I followed him he put me into the watch-house - when I went to him the next day he said I did not like to appear against you THOMAS TUCKER I have been under the necessity of putting several of them in the watch-house and I believe I did put him in I got him an appointment to go to sea at his own request once and gave him clothes but he never went GUILTY Aged 22 -

there are other partner s On the 2nd of August the prisoner came into the counting-house and presented this cheque - my initials are on it on inspecting it I suspected it was not correct and asked him in what name he received it he replied Gill - I then asked his own name he answered Watts I then quitted my seat and showed it to the other cashiers in consequence of what transpired in his absence he was desired to wait by Sir Edward Antrobus to whom I gave the cheque Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q You put your initials on the cheque I suppose that was a considerable time after A On the following morning Q In reply to your asking his name are you sure he was not interrupted in his answer and meant to say What s the use of telling you or something of that sort A I heard him say Watts SIR EDWARD ANTROBUS I am a partner in Coutts banking-house and was there on the 2nd of August - my attention was drawn to this cheque purporting to be drawn by Mr Paxton I went to the prisoner after the cheque was shown to me and told him a difficulty had occurred respecting payment of the draft and begged he would sit down till it was cleared up - he followed me immediately to a chair which I pointed out inside the counter I do not recollect his making any answer - I then desired Mr Partride to send for Mr Paxton the porter was sent for him but Mr Robinson his clerk came and made a communication to me after remaining on his seat about twenty minutes the prisoner was taken into another room the door between that and the room I was in was always open I happened to look into the room and saw him emptying a small phial into his mouth the contents of which he had almost drank before I saw him I do not think he had had an opportunity of seeing Mr Robinson - it was about half an hour after he presented the cheque I sent him to an apothecary close by who gave him an emetic which proved effectual the cheque was placed in my hands by Mr Partridge I believe that produced to be the same Cross-examined Q Where was he sitting for the first twenty minutes A In a room within the office not in the banking-house there were two clerks in that room I took the cheque in my hand when I asked him to sit down I then gave it back to Mr Partridge I believe he parted with it afterwards MR BODKIN Q Did you compare it with other cheques A Yes with five or six - it was under my notice about five minutes I have no doubt in my mind that this is the cheque JOSEPH SADLER THOMAS I am a superintendent of the Police On the 2nd of August the prisoner was brought to the station-house Covent-garden on this charge - I received the cheque the following morning from Mr Colthurst one of the firm in Mr Partridge s presence Mr Paxton marked it at the time - I had a conversation with the prisoner I cautioned him that I was about to put a question to him and that he had no occasion to answer it unless he thought proper MR ADOLPHUS Q Was he not at that time in an extreme state of suffering both in body and mind A He was - my opinion is that he was in that state of mind I could not depend on his evidence in any case I had a second conversation with him about three-quarters of an hour after he was in my custody - I think he was then considerably excited I told him he was not obliged to answer any questions affecting his case - he said Then I suppose I am not obliged to answer at all I said Certainly not COURT Q When this took place was he in his senses so as to know what he was saying A I conceive he knew what he was saying but was certainly considerably excited he spoke as if he knew what he was about - I told him whatever he said would be used against him on his trial and that he was charged with uttering a forged bill for payment of 200l on Messrs Coutt s he said Oh yes oh yes I did I said Was it a good cheque he said Yes it was - he was at that time crying very much I searched him and found this note on him enclosed in this I envelope - I marked them at the time Cross-examined Q The cheque was brought to you next day and then Mr Partridge put his name on it A Yes there was no mark on it before that I am aware of - the prisoner was in a back room at the station-house when I put these questions they were put within an hour after he was taken Q He was under the operation of posion and counterpoison at the time the conversation took place A He was - his answers were quick and sharp but at the same time he was under so much excitement I could not depend on what he said the room was full of officers and one or two surgeons - I asked the questions because I had the previous assurance of the surgeon that he was in danger and I thought it my duty to put them I had no idea of giving evidence at the time I certainly considered if he survived I should have to give evidence I put them from a sense of duty considering him in danger and that crime might attach to other persons MR BODKIN Q Did he make any statement to you before you cautioned him A No he answered as if he understood my questions WILLIAM GILL PAXTON I am a wine-merchant and live in Buckingham-street Strand In August last I had an account at Messrs Coutts and am in the habit of drawing cheques on them no part of this cheque is in my handwriting nor was it written by my authority - Mr Watts a stockbroker in the City is a friend of mine I am often at his counting-house and have seen the prisoner there - he was clerk there I believe I frequently saw him in the office when I have been there and dare say I have written when he has been there and he might know I kept an account at Coutts but I cannot say particularly Cross-examined Q I believe you had a very good opinion of the prisoner and recommended him to a situation A I spoke to a person to give him one in consequence of Mr Watts speaking well of him WILLIAM WATTS I am a stockbroker and live in Tokenhouse-yard The prisoner came into my service the middle of March 1830 and remained till the time in question - I have had frequent opportunities of seeing his handwriting this note and the envelope appear to be in his writing I believe them to be so - the body of the cheque seems to be the same hand-writing the signature and all the written part of the cheque I believe to be his writing I saw him at the station-house about six o clock on the evening he was taken - I held out no inducement or promise to induce him to say any thing to me - the first question I put to him was where he had got the cheque it being a printed one he told me it was one remaining cheque in an old cheque-book which was put away with my old books in my office - I asked where he had written it he said he wrote it at his desk while I was washing my hands in an inner room - I had not sent him that day to Messrs Coutts I beg to add he was not my clerk but my office boy Cross-examined Q Has he not been above two years with you A Yes he bore a very excellent character -

my bankers are Messrs Williams Deacon and Co About the end of October the prisoner introduced himself to me by a letter of introduction he came to my counting-house one day about the end of November and asked me if I could negociate bills on his father s house for 150l he said his father carried on business at Rotterdam - while he was there stamps were sent out for to draw the bills on and they were drawn in my presence - these are the bills which he drew after they were drawn he asked me if I would be kind enough to negociate them and give him the money for them - I said I did not know his father s house - I made inquiry and could hear nothing of that house and refused to advance him money on them - he came again on the 13th the next day and asked me to let him have 20l on the bills and I gave him a cheque on my bankers for that amount this is the cheque - he said he wanted the 20l to go down to Brighton with a friend I drew the cheque in his presence and he wrote his name on the back - I went with him and showed him the banking-house and left him there on the 15th he called again between twelve and one o clock and asked me to allow him a sheet of paper to write a letter - I gave him one and he wrote a letter at the same table as I sat at he sat opposite to me - my cheque-book laid on the table at my side after he had written the letter I had occasion to leave the room leaving my cheque-book in the place I have stated - I went up stairs leaving the cheque-book within his reach this is the cheque-book - my clerk sat with his back to him I returned in a few minutes - I found him there and the cheque-book where I had left it I then showed the prisoner the Bank and Lloyd s and other places and on parting with him I promised to get him a ticket for the Lord Mayor s ball which was that night or the next night there was not the slightest intimation from him that he was going to leave the country - I received information the same day from Messrs Williams and in consequence of a description given me by the clerk I gave directions that the prisoner should be given into custody inquires were made after him without effect - the ticket for the ball was to be sent to him at the Royal-hotel St James application was made for him there but we could hear nothing of him - this cheque - looking at it is not in my hand-writing I believe the body of it to be the hand-writing of the prisoner - I believe the whole to be his hand-writing it says 55 pound leaving out the s the word pound is spelt in the bills also without the s - the forged cheque is in the same hand as the letter he wrote which was addressed to Mr Reading Prisoner Q At what time on the 15th did we separate in the Poultry A I should think about two o clock - I should think it impossible that the cheque could have been abstracted from my book before that day - I usually left it on my table Mr BODKIN Q Can you account for all the two hundred cheques in your book except this one A I can I had used the book on the 14th EDWARD GOLDING ANDREWS I am clerk to Messrs Robinson and Co there is only one partner besides Mr Robinson - the prisoner was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards I remember his coming on the 15th of November - Mr Robinson was not at home when he first came I asked him to sit down and gave him the newspaper - I sit with my back to Mr Robinson s table and cannot see any thing that takes place at the table Mr Robinson came in in about half an hour - I do not recollect the prisoner writing a letter he was sitting at the table with Mr Robinson - Mr Robinson left the office for a few minutes leaving nobody but me and the prisoner there he was sitting at the table at the time - I could not see any thing he might do at the table the cheque-book generally lays on the table - Mr Atkins does business in our office nobody else has an opportunity of touching the cheque-book - it is locked in Mr Robinson s drawer after business hours I do not interfere with the cheque-book at any time - the prisoner and Mr Robinson afterwards went out together about one o clock I understood he lodged at St James hotel - I lost sight of the prisoner after that entirely I think I met him once in Coleman-street but I was not certain it was him and did not stop him - in February I saw him in Regent-street I went up to him and said How do you do Mr Peppers he said Very well - I asked if he had heard from his friends he said No - I then asked if he was walking about Regent-street he said No he was waiting for a friend - I kept him in conversation and saw an officer in a few minutes I then ran and met the officer and brought him to the prisoner - I ran forward and laid hold of him by the arm he said For God Almighty s sake do not take me - he saw the officer in his uniform with me I had told him before that Mr Robinson wanted to see him and asked him to call on him - he said he would next day I think he was going down Warwick-street when I took him - I did not intimate that I was going for an officer THOMAS SHUTT ATKINS I am an insurance-broker I occupy part of Mr Robinson s premises On the 15th of November I cannot be positive that I saw the prisoner there I could have made use of Mr Robinson s chequebook but never did In consequence of a communication made to me I went to the Royal hotel on the 15th of November with two officers I inquired for the prisoner but I did not find him WILLIAM WILLIAMS I am a clerk in the banking-house of Meesrs Williams and Co they have an account with Robinson and Co Old Jewry - the cheques we use have one number through the whole book each customer has a distinct number - this cheque-book is No 403 that number was on all the cheques in that book - it contained exactly two hundred cheques this 20l cheque was paid in course on the 15th of November about four o clock in the afternoon - this 55l cheque was brought to our house it was presented by a man whose general appearance was like the prisoner but he was in a very different dress - he had a dark frock-coat buttoned close up it was in rather a dark part of the office - the person s height and general appearance was like the prisoner on the cheque being presented I had some doubt of the signature and went to the back part of the office to compare the signature and when I returned to the counter the person who presented it was gone - it is an imitation of Robinson and Co s signature the s was omitted in the word pounds - I wrote on it Differs from the usual signature and returned it to Mr Robinson JURY Q Did you hear the prisoner speak A Yes I cannot say whether the prisoner s voice corresponds - he said he would have gold he only said the single word gold Prisoner Q Are there not persons of similar appearance to myself A No doubt of it MR ROBINSON On the 15th of November when the prisoner left me he had a dark frock coat on ANDREW MOYS I was waiter at the Royal hotel St James -street on the 15th of November - the prisoner was stopping there some time before that I cannot say when he left - I recollect inquiry being made after him by two or three gentlemen I had seen him the day before but not on that day nor afterwards I was there for two months afterwards and never saw him WILLIAM HENRY BRUCE I am a stationer and prepare the cheque-books for Messrs Williams and Co I made this cheque-book - I have not the least doubt but the cheque in question formed part of that book I can point out the part of the book from which a cheque has been taken there were two hundred cheques in it when it was made and all bore the No 403 here is the rough edge left from which the cheque has been torn - the margin has since been cut off the cheque but I can tell from the appearance of the cheque in length and breadth that it has been in that book and I speak more positively because only one book was numbered 403 I am certain that cheque has been in that book Prisoner Q Has the cheque been torn or cut out A Torn the others are cut off at the margin The bills referred to being produced had the letter s omitted in the word pounds Prisoner s Defence I am a foreigner but a consciousness of my innocence has induced me to come to this bar unprotected by counsel or professional advice I cannot but avail myself of the opportunity of pointing out the very loose evidence to fix the crime on me - it amounts to nothing but that the cheque is drawn in the name of a gentleman to whom I happened to write a letter - and will you consign me to slavery for life for this can such a coincidence warrant such an act - conceive the impossibility of my tearing the cheque out in the presence of the clerk and that I should be such a madman as to draw it in thename of a gentleman and leave the letter in the prosecutor s possession GUILTY Aged 28 -

I objected to do it without further security I made inquiry as to who the acceptor was it was accepted at the time the prisoner gave it to me - it purports to be accepted by John Gore and is addressed to John Gore No 2 Camomile-street Bishopsgate - The prisoner at that time lived in Camomile-street and was a carpenter - I inquired and found Mr Gore a butcher in Camomile-street was a respectable man and I was satisfied - a Mr Wagner came to me and gave me security as far as ten pounds if the bill should not be paid he is in court before Wagner came the prisoner said Wagner was a surveyor that he was doing a job under him and he should call and speak to me as to his character if I desired it - Wagner called and offered the guarantee before I made the inquiry - I asked the prisoner if Gore was a respectable man and how long he had lived there he said he had lived there two or three years that he was a butcher and very regular in his business and a steady man - I paid the bill into my banker s it was a three-months bill it was returned to me on the 26th of February dishonoured after that Mr Wagner called to pay the ten pounds Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you keep the bill after it was dishonoured A I did till a few days before I applied at the Mansion-house I had then given it to Mr Newman who applied to me for it and gave an undertaking that it should be paid he wished to have it for the purpose of prosecuting the prisoner - I believe he is an independent gentleman I had seen him once or twice before - he gave me an undertaking for nineteen pounds the entire amount due on the bill - I am not at the expense of this prosecution JAMES GORE I am a butcher and live in Camomile-street Bishopsgate I know the prisoner - looking at the bill this acceptance is not my hand-writing nor my name I did not authorize anybody either to draw on me or accept that bill for me - there is no person named John Gore living at No 2 Camomile-street I have no relation of the name of John my name is not John I never accept in the name of John I never accepted a bill in my life that I know of - I remember the prisoner coming to me on the subject of a bill two or three months back I cannot be positive as to the time I know well that it was before Christmas - he asked me whether I would accept a bill for him I said No I would not he said If you will accept a bill for me I have a large job and if I can get any body to accept a bill for me we could get a load of timber in I did not at that time know Mr Wagner I said I would not accept for my own brother - I saw him again a few days after I was in the habit of seeing him every day more or less as he was a neighbour he lived at No 9 in my street he said no more to me about this - at the time he asked me to accept the bill he said the job he had was at Dalston - I saw some timber on his premises in a very short time after he asked me to accept the bill - I have two brothers Thomas and Robert they do not live with me - this bill was presented at my house in February but I was out at the time I never paid the bill - I met the prisoner about three weeks or a month afterward I had in the meantime heard of the bill being presented at my house - I met him in Bishopsgate-street and said Spring you are a pretty sort of a chap or fellow to try to get me into this trouble and ask me to accept a bill he said It is all right it is paid and you will hear no more of it - I did not know the person of Wagner before I saw him at the Mansion-house - a person had called at my house respecting the bill I saw that person I am not able to say whether it was Wagner or not I am quite certain I never have under any circumstances stated to any body that it was my acceptance or done by my authority Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Had you a conversation of some lenght with the gentleman who called A I had he was a very few minutes with me it was not a quarter of an hour - I do not recollect the person of Wagner I cannot exactly state when the prisoner applied about the bill - I may have accepted a bill before I was in business not knowing the nature of bills but not since I have been in business three years and am twenty-six years old - I believe I never did accept a bill I swear I never accepted this bill - I never told anybody I had accepted this bill - it was presented at my house on a Monday morning while I was at market when I returned I was told a bill drawn by Spring had been presented - I think it was about two months ago - I went to the prisoner s house directly to inquire for him but he had left I saw Mr Newman there - I named this to a person in my street and he told me if I had nothing to do with it to take no notice of it and I did not - I am sure I told the gentleman who called that I had not accepted the bill I cannot say how long that was before I was at the Mansion-house - I was present when Wagner was examined at the Mansion-house but cannot say whether it was him that called on me about the bill MR CLARKSON Q How soon after you heard of the bill did you go to the prisoner s house A The same morning directly I returned from market I found he had left - he never returned COURT Q Did you ever in your life sign your name to a bill as John A Never it is not my writing I don t know whose it is - my hand-writing is under the bill THOMAS URSDEN GORE I am the brother of the last witness I live at No 227 Shoreditch and am a scale-maker I was in Bishopsagate-street with my brother when he met the prisoner I think it was about two months ago - my brother I believe called him a pretty fellow to try to get him into such trouble - the prisoner said Mr Gore you need not trouble yourself it is all settled the bill is paid - this acceptance is not my brother s hand-writing Cross-examined Q Did he not say You are a pretty fellow to get me into trouble by letting the bill be dishonoured A No nothing of the kind he said nothing about the prisoner promising to provide for the bill my brother has never accepted a bill since he has been in business The bill was here read it purported to be drawn by M J Spring on John Gore at three months date and to be due on the 25th of February GEORGE NEWMAN I live at Brixton-place Surrey I live on my property The prisoner was a tenant of mine he lived in a house of mine No 9 Camomile-street he quitted it on Saturday the 23rd of February - I have frequently seen him write - this bill is decidedly not drawn in the prisoner s hand-writing but the acceptance is in the prisoner s usual way of writing - I first saw this bill of exchange on Monday morning the 25th of February the day it became payable I was in the house - Mr James Gore and another person called I merely saw the bill - I said I had nothing to do with it that Spring was gone I presume they took me for Spring - I afterward went to Mr Gore for the bill in consequence of what occurred - this prosecution is instituted at my expense Cross-examined Q I believe you distrained on the prisoner A I did he has brought an action against me since for defamation but it is an action of robbery - upon his bringing the action I endeavoured to find out what I had said and found he was in debt to every body and was a complete swindler - it was said defamation nonsense there is forgery against him and it was six weeks before I could find this out - I expect if he is convicted it will be an answer to the action - that is one reason why I have taken this up but it is the complete system of plunder the man has brought several actions against me - Wagner was sent to entrap me - my object is the love of prosecuting such swindlers and wretches that I have been beset by it is nothing but for the sake of public justice - it will necessarily save me from the action - I stated at the Mansion-house that the prisoner would have been ten quarters in my house if he had stopped till Lady-day and I had received but two quarters in money the rent was fifty pounds a year - he has got the account - by my buying the fixtures and work he has done the rent is settled up to Christmas - I cannot say how much he owed me at Christmas for he never paid me but by driblets - this is my receipt for twenty-two pounds thirteen shillings looking at it - he does not now owe me a farthing for rent - I did not swear at the Mansion-house that he owed me money for rent I said he owed me money - he has cut my house about - he was a carpenter and I allowed him to do all the business on the estate - my sister died and I gave him the funeral he said he was poor and I advanced him twenty pounds then twenty eight pounds and altogether he drove the bill for the funeral up to one hundred and nineteen pounds odd- this receipt looking at it is my wife s writing it is for a quarter s rent due at Christmas but his bills are included it was not paid in money - I understood he has brought two actions against me it is an action of trover- the action is for detaining pieces of wood - I never saw Wagner in my life till he called on me - I saw him at No 3 Broadway Doctors Commons - I went to him after he had called on me to give him a job to survey a house as he told me he should be a considerable loser by Spring - I did not know him till Monday the 25th when he called on me MR CLARKSON Q Wagner called on you on the 25th A Yes the very day the bill was presented about a quarter of an hour after he did not speak favourably of the prisoner - the receipts produced were given on the balancing of accounts between us allowing for work which he had done - I never received but twelve pounds from him in money - I was examined at the Mansion-house by desire of the prisoner s solicitor JURY Q By whom was the bill brought to the prisoner s house on the 25th of February A By Mr Walton the holder and Mr Gore who said it was neither his name nor hand-writing and he wrote on the bill The above is neither my name nor hand-writing James Gore Mr SARSON I am an attorney and live in Broad-street-buildings I know the hand-writing of the prisoner and have often seen him write looking at the bill I believe this acceptance to be his hand-writing Cross-examined Q Are you attorney for Mr Newman A I am in the action but not in this prosecution and have no interest in it MR CLARKSON Q Look at the name of the drawer A I believe that is not the prisoner s writing but the indorsement is his hand writing JOHN FORRESTER I am an officer of the City I took the prisoner into custody on the 6th of May on St Andrew s-hill Doctors Commons coming out of the Three Castles public-house Prisoner s Defence Written Mr Newman distrained upon me for rent - all accounts between us were however settled and although he had the cruelty to insinuate on my examination before the Lord Mayor among other things equally untrue that I had been in his house ten quarters and he had only been paid two a balance of about nine pounds was found to be due to me after paying all the rent due to him Upon this settlement I quitted the premises and the neighbourhood as I felt myself disgraced by the distress put in by Mr Newman although it proved there was nothing due to him and as he still retained possession of some property belonging to me I commenced legal proceedings against him and to get rid of the consequences do I attribute the persecutions of Mr Newman for he afterwards called upon a Mr Greig who had accepted a bill for me and insinuated that it was a forgery which Mr Greig denied - with Mr Gore whose name I am this day charged with forging he succeeded and has prevailed upon him to deny his acceptance to the bill Gentlemen it is necessary I should explain under what circumstances I obtained Mr Gore s acceptence - I had been employed by Mr Wagner to do the carpenter s work of some houses at Hoxton Mr Walton the timber merchant would not let me have the timber without I gave him some security and Gore s acceptance was obtained and deposited with him at which time I also paid him ten pounds and I prevailed upon Mr Wagner to pay him ten pounds more on account of the work I had done for him at this time Mr Newman well knew I had credit with Mr Walton and that this bill was becoming due and I believe was in possession of my house when the bill became due and was presented to Gore and who sent the notary s clerk to my house from whom I believe Newman received the ticket Up to this time nor for two months afterwards had an insinuation been made against me that the bill was a forgery on the contrary Gore on my wife s going to his shop for meat had upon more than one occasion said he hoped I would be prepared for the bill but I am deprived of her testimony as I am advised the law will not allow her to be a witness for me and after I had left the neighbourhood I got Mr Wagner to call on Gore to tell him not to make himself uneasy about the bill to him Gore did not say one word about its being a forgery but said he only did it to assit me There is one circumstance I should explain to you - whenI had drawn the bill I had put the wrong Christian name Gore however said that was of no consequence and it was so accepted Gentlemen bear in mind Gore must have known of the presentment of the bill at his house had it been a forgery would he have waited two months to consider about giving charge of me I was on intimate terms and used to ride out in his cart with him and he has on a former occasion assisted me Newman also knew of the bill s being presented although he two months afterwards buys up the bill to incite this charge against me I am ruined by him and am pennyless JOHN WAGNER I am an accountant I live at No 3 Broadway Doctors Commons Blackfriars I had employed the prisoner to do builder s work for me at some houses he was going on with them when I paid Mr Walton ten pounds on account of this bill - I called on Gore very shortly after the bill became due I introduced myself by saying I believe you are the acceptor of a bill now in the hands of Mr Walton Gore replied somewhat pettishly I know nothing at all of it I cannot pay it I only did it to serve him - I had known Spring about three months he conducted himself as an honest although a poor man - I have paid him nearly a hundred pounds MR CLARKSON Q You had a high opinion of him A I had a good opinion of him as an honest industrious man he was not in my debt except as to the guarantee Q Have not you said he was in your debt to the amount of forty pounds A I think not I cannot answer further than that - I never represented that he was a very wicked man and had robbed me of forty pounds - I saw Mr Newman at the house in Camomile-street two days after Spring had been destrained on - it was the day the bill became due - Walton called on me to inquire the character of the man and I called on him afterwards on Christmas morning Spring was not in my debt then but finding my job was going on rather slowly I gave the guarantee to further the job and serve him he was working on a house belonging to a party for whom I was concerned named Bishop - Coster was not concerned in it I swear he had nothing to with it I did not know him - Bishop lives at Dalston he is a poor builder who has been unfortunate he applied to me to assist him I finished the carcased and by that means the job got into my hands his application to me was to aid and assist him to complete them and perhaps to advance some portion of money entirely as an agent - I am an accountant and agent I don t call myself a surveyor I will not swear I never called myself a surveyor I have been a linen-draper I have been a bankrupt and paid sixteen shillings and tenpence in the pound at the age of twenty-three I don t believe that I ever called myself a surveyor Q Have you not represented yourself as employed to survey houses for Mr Rhodes A Certainly not Q Have you represented yourself as connected with Mr Rhodes A Only as regards these carcases which are on his estate I called myself before the Lord Mayor an accoutant and conveyancer I have not taken out a certificate as a conveyancer I am not yet admitted at any inn of court nor am I a student at any inn at present - I did not tell Mr Newman the prisoner had robbed me of forty pounds nor that I was very much inconvenienced for want of the money I did not ask him to employ me as a surveyor he asked for my card and said he might put business into my hands I did not say I was surveying houses for Mr Rhodes at Dalston - Mr Newman called on me in Broadway and said he wanted me to value the dilapidations of a house I said my time was so occupied that I could not undertake it at present we talked about my terms he said Have you seen Spring lately how is he going on I said rather indifferently and then we parted for I had several parties waiting for me up stairs Q When you saw Newman at Camomile-street did you complain of the prisoner s conduct A As far as related to the job I believe I did as it went on slowly I did not say he was a d - d rascal I might say he was a rascal and believe I did after Newman had made his statement to me but I afterwards enquired into the truth of what he did say - I told Spring what Newman had said against him in a fortnight or ten days and an action was brought against him I was applied to as a witness MR PHILLIPS Q Did you satisfy your mind upon enquiring that Mr Newman either mistakenly or designedly told you what was wrong A Yes I endeavoured to satisfy myself and then mentioned it to Spring COURT Q When you called on Mr Gore had you the bill in your hand A Certainly not I had not seen it I did not think it necessary to tell him how it was accepted I applied to him as the acceptor I swear positively he said he did it to oblige Spring I knew nothing about the bill except paying the ten pounds till about three weeks ago I saw the ten pounds written on the back of it I paid the ten pounds after it was due on the 27th of February and about three weeks ago Walton applied to me to see Newman - he told him it was a forgery I said it could not be and told me if Newman would pay him by all means to take the money - I knew where Gore lived when I paid the ten pounds Walton had told me it was accepted by Gore a butcher in Camomile-street I cannot recollect whether he told me his christian name the bill was never in my possession Q Did you ask Gore how he could know nothing about it if he accepted it to serve the prisoner A No I thought it proceeded merely from his manner I had no further conversation with him about the acceptance - I have seen the prisoner write I should say the signature M J Spring to the bill is not his writing the indorsement I should say is his writing JAMES WALTON I received the bill on the 23rd of November MR PHILLIPS Q When did Wagner agree to the guarantee A It might be about Christmas I had some doubts about the bill and he gave the guarantee to strengthen it I had not then delivered all the timber JOHN WAGNER I called and paid Mr Walton the ten pounds - I had been apprised of the bill not being paid MR PHILLIPS Q What took you to Spring s house where you first saw Walton A I had sent my servant with a note to Spring s on the previous day Sunday he brought an answer that he had been distrained on I went to discover where he was gone MR CLARKSON Q Then the prisoner left without giving you any notice at all A I knew nothing of it THOMAS URSDEN GORE I knew Mr Newman before this transaction Henry Hide of Mark-lane wine-merchant and William Smart a Juror gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 30 -

I saw the prisoner on the 30th of March and asked him to put 5l into the Savings -bank for me I gave him five sovereigns and my deposit book and told him to tell the clerk at the bank to put the amount of interest at the bottom of the book looking at a book that is the book I gave the prisoner here is 62l 13s added up neither of the sums after that amount were in the book when I gave it to the prisoner £5 and £2 0 0 1/2 C Boodle 175 have been added since it was not there when I gave it to the prisoner - I saw him again in the evening of the 30th between five and six o clock I had no conversation with him about the money that night - I asked him for the book he said he had left it at home and would bring it down to me in the morning but I did not see him again till Monday night between ten and eleven o clock the 1st of April he called for a glass of ginger-beer which I served him with - I asked him for the book and he gave it to me he said nothing - I put it into my pocket being busy without looking at it - I went to bed about half-an-hour afterwards and then I looked at the book - it had been in my pocket from the time I received it from him I then saw this entry of £5 and C Boodle £2 0 0 1/2 at the bottom - I applied to the Provident Institution on the 20th of April to take out all my money - I saw Mr Morton and showed him the book Mr Morton then made these figures 175 in it then this was on a Saturday- it requires a week s notice to get the money - I applied again on the 27th of April to receive my money and saw a gentleman named Arnott and produced the book to him and in consequence of something which was said I went with the book to Mr Boodle at his seat in the office- in consequence of some communication I made to him the prisoner was taken into custody Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Were you not in the habit of lending the prisoner money A I never lent him any in my life - I could not get out to take this money myself and got him to do it - I am certain I saw this entry the first time I opened the book after he returned it to me Q I believe your master accuses you of stealing this money A He has done so and the Grand Jury have found a true bill against me I am now in custody on that charge MR LEE Q Is not your master s charge for embezzling half-a-crown A It is COURT Q When Mr Boodle pointed out the forgery to you did he ask if you had given the book to anybody to bring to the institution for you A Yes I said to no one but who had brought it to the bank Q Did not you say No I have not A I said so but I said to no one but what had brought it to the bank - he put the question to me two or three times and told me to be careful how I answered - he asked if I had trusted the book to anybody and I said no I said I had not given it to any person but who brought it to the bank and he said did I know the person WILLIAM MORTON I am one of the clerks in the Provident Institution It is a rule for people to give a week s notice before they can take money - by the books it appears that the last witness deposited several sums in our bank - I remember his applying to me on the 20th of April he produced this book and I marked it 175 which is the folio of the notice book where all the sums to be drawn out are entered - I produce the notice which he signed to withdraw the money - I took down the amount as being 67l 8s which included the last entry of 5l - I told him to apply that day week - the amount when I had the book was 67l 8s but a witness can explain a difference in it CHARLES ARNOTT I am ledger clerk in the Provident Institution On the 27th of April I recollect the prosecutor applying to me for payment of his money - it is part of my duty to compare the amounts in the ledger with the pass-book - this is the book produced by Jutsum the entry 5l and 2l 0s 0 1/2d were there when he produced it- in consequence of suspicion I sent Jutsum to Mr Boodle s desk - the notice for 67l 8s arises from the amount of interest not being entered on the 9th of February when 10l had been paid in - the entry of 2l 0s 0 1/2d is an irregular entry it is incorrect whoever made it EDWARD BOODLE ESQ I am auditor of the accounts of the Provident Institution and am a barrister The prosecutor was brought to my part of the office on the 27th of April by Mr Arnott - It is my duty when deposits are made to enter them in a book of my own and sign my name to the deposit-book - this signature to the 5l entry is not in my hand-writing - this is a pass-book the entry 5l purports that 5l was paid in by Jutsum on the 10th of March it purports to be a receipt by me on account of the institution of 5l from him which if correct we should have paid on application - here is 30th March 1833 5l - that is not in the hand-writing of anybody authorised to make the entry - the signatures before that are in my hand-writing but not the amounts - the Duke of Somerset s name is Edward Adolphus Seymour - in consequence of some communication which took place on this occasion Samuel Stevens was directed to take the prisoner into custody - I know the Duke of Somerset has acted as trustee to the institution constantly and there are five others Cross-examined Q Is it the last signature in the book which you say is not yours A Yes all the other signatures are mine nobody is authorised to sign my name - the managers attend at the office but then they attest payments by their own signatures COURT Q When Jutsum was brought to you did youask if he had given the book into any other person s hands to bring A I asked if the book had been in any other person s hands he answered no two or three times - my impression was that he thought I was asking if he had left it in any person s hands I repeated the question and he said he had never parted with it except to the party who had brought it the last time ROBERT PERROT I am actuary to the Provident Institution looking at the book This last entry is not in the hand writing of any person in the establishment Cross-examined Q How many persons are in the establishment A Seven I can swear to all their hand writings SAMUEL STEVENS I am a Bow-street officer In consequence of information which I received I took the prisoner into custody on the 29th of April at Battle-bridge - I told him Mr Clarke s young man had got himself into trouble and that he had brought his name in question I said he must go before a magistrate and account for it he seemed confused and his father asked him if he was going on business - he said Yes it is bad business Q Did you tell him how his name was brought in question A I said it was with respect to 5l - his father asked what it was about and asked him and he said it was respecting the 5l he had of Mr Clarke s young man - his father said If that is all I think we can make it right - I don t think he made any reply - I then took him into custody - I cautioned him not to say anything if he did I should take notice of it - before I brought him out of the house but on the way to the office he said I see what this business is it is a forgery - I said yes you have acted very foolishly indeed and if you had spoken to the young man about the circumstance I think it would not have come to this - he said he had met Jutsum several times but never had fortitude enough to tell him the circumstance or otherwise he thought it would have been better - I searched him and found a piece of writing-paper on him which he said was his hand-writing but afterwards denied it Cross-examined Q Are you quite sure what he said was not If it is a forgery it will be a bad job for Jutsum A No he did not nor anything to that effect JURY Q You say you mentioned to him something about 5l and he afterwards said it was about 5l of Clarke s young man which got him into trouble - did anything occur between those two statements to give him any knowledge that was the 5l referred to A No he appeared to be aware of it COURT Q Did you tell him Clarke s young man had got into trouble about 5l A I said Clarke s young man had got into trouble and his name was brought in question and he must account for it before the magistrate - he asked me what it was about I said respecting 5l - he told his father it was about 5l which he had had from Clarke s young man - he said nothing about the money being lent to him MORRIS VINE I am clerk to the magistrates at Bow-street I recollect the prisoner being brought before the magistrate on this charge - he made a statement which was reduced to writing it was read over to him he did not sign it - I took it myself this is it it has Mr Minshull s the magistrate s signature - here is a second statement which was signed by the magistrate and read over to the prisoner read The prisoner says the first witness cannot be relied on he has left his situation for taking the money from the till and he says he gave me five sovereigns at one time which was not true I had one sovereign full a week before I had the other four I did not tell the policeman the paper found on me was my writing - 2nd May The prisoner says I acknowledge having received the money but I defy any man in existence to prove the writing in the book is my hand-writing Prisoner s Defence I beg to say I deny ever having the book in question in my possession - I have been in the habit of borrowing money of Jutsum the first was 5s the next 1l and the last 4l - he never gave me any to pay into the Savings Bank Charles Carter a butcher gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 33 -

t18330905-101  First London Jury before Mr Recorder 1304 ELIZABETH WRATTEN * was indicted for that she on the 26th of June feloniously did forge and counterfeit a certain order for payment of money which is as follows *Upon the prisoner being brought into court on the previous day to be arraigned she did not plead to the indictment and appeared to take no notice of what was passing A Jury were impannelled to determine whether she was of sound mind and upon the evidence of William Woodward William George Hannah Reeve Thomas Wood Thomas James Thomas Gook and Dr Uwins on her behalf and Thomas Halifax Francis Punter Walter Smith Thomas Danby Samuel Gardner John Burke John Ward William Simpson Jonas Glapham Mr McMurdo surgeon of Newgate Sarah Ruthven nurse and Eliza Brown sub-matron the Jury found her of sound mind and the Court ordered a plea of Not Guilty to be recorded Woolwich Bank 25th June 1833 Messrs Masterman pay Mr Gregory or Bearer sixty pounds five shillings For Budgen and Co JOHN WARD with intent to defraud William Masterman and others 2nd COUNT For uttering disposing of and putting away the said order with like intent 2 other COUNTS The same only stating her intention to be to defraud John Ward and others 4 other COUNTS The same only omitting to set out the forged instrument MESSRS BODKIN and DAWSON conducted the prosecution JOHN WARD I am a partner in the house of Bugden and Co banker s of Woolwich We correspond with Masterman s bank - shortly before the 26th of June the prisoner came to the bank to get a cheque for 4l 9s which she said she was about to send to Lymington she paid me 4l 9s for it - I did not see her again till she was in custody - the cheque was signed for Bugden and Co John Ward looking at the signature to the cheque in question - this is a good resemblance of the signature to that cheque - our clerk afterwards received the cheque back from her and gave her the money for it I was in the bank at the time but did not take notice of her - this cheque is not signed by me it is not my hand-writing Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Do you mean to swear that positively A Yes the signature very much resembles my usual mode of writing it very much resembles the signature to the cheque I gave her Q Have the kindness to write Messrs Masterman and Co pay to Mr Gregory or bearer 60l and 60l 5s in figures the witness did so Witness I have written that the way I usually write - it is like the signature to the cheque in my opinion - I think it is rather smaller than that - I don t think that that Gregory or bearer is quite dissimilar I think there is a character about it very like mine - I wrote the cheque in my ordinary hand - I think the two are alike - I knew the prisoner before she frequently came to the bank I frequently saw her myself - I should say she is fifty years old I should not think she is nearer seventy I am a very bad judge of ladies ages WILLIAM SIMPSON I am a clerk to William Masterman and Co bankers - there are other partners - on the 26th of June the prisoner came to the banking-house she presented this cheque for payment about three o clock in the afternoon - Bugden and Co of Woolwich have an account at our house - on taking the cheque from her hand I observed something in the body of it which looked suspicious and the appearance of it altogether - I took it to the counting-house and afterwards to the country-office where it was compared - I asked her if the cheque was payable to her and she said yes that was her name it was payable to Mr Gregory - I then went into the country-office and returned to the counter she remained there - I then asked for her address and in what way she got possession of the cheque she stated that she lived at No 3 Stewart s-buildings Battersea and that this cheque formed part of a letter which was sent to her by the post it has that appearance - I wrote the address she gave me on the cheque in her presence - I know the signature of Mr Ward I am in the habit of paying drafts which he draws - I consider this a very good imitation of his handwriting so that on making inquiry I was authorised to pay the cheque and asked the prisoner how she would receive it - she said two twenties and four fives or to that effect - I paid her two 20l Bank notes four 5l notes and 5s in silver - she was in the banking house for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - she answered to my questions quite readily I paid her and she left Cross-examined Q She said she would take two twenties and four fives did she A Yes that was the way I paid her I have not the least doubt she asked for the notes I gave her - I am not sure whether she answered two twenties and four fives or whether I asked her if she would have it in that way I have not a doubt but she asked for two twenties and four fives I will be positive she did ask for those particular notes in the way I paid her - I cannot say whether she said she would have it so or whether I asked her I am aware that the prisoner s defence is weakness of intellect COURT Q Are you in the habit of suggesting what money cheques shall be paid in A Frequently parties say how they will have it and if they do not say what they will have we suggest it to them MR PHILLIPS Q Did she mention the description of notes or did you suggest it A I have no doubt she did ask for the notes I paid her for at the time I was paying it she inquired of me if it was in time to send money by the Portsmouth mail and I considered she wanted small notes to inclose in a letter - I will swear she used the words two twenties and four fives I am sure of it I have not a doubt in my mind that she asked for the particular notes I paid her that she said Give me two twenties and four fives I have not a doubt of it - I have no doubt it was paid in the way she asked for it but whether she said two twenties or two 20l notes I cannot say Q Now if she asked for any notes at all did not she say two 20l notes and four 5l notes if she used any phrase at all about the notes A I cannot tell her exact words MR BODKIN Q Twenties and fives is a phrase used in banking-houses to denote notes of that amount A Yes she inquired if she was in time to send money by the mail this was while I was paying her the notes - she asked when the Portsmouth mail went off - it was about three o clock ELIZABETH DANCE I live at No 3 Stewart s-buildings Battersea-fields The prisoner did not live there I know nothing of her at all JOHN PAGET TREMLET I am clerk and shopman to Mr Williams of 174 Fenchurch-street a hosier and linendraper I remember seeing the prisoner in our shop on Wednesday the 26th of June at near three o clock in the afternoon she asked the price of a gingham dress she did not bargain for anything she then asked for a pen and ink - she made no purchase in our shop - at her desire Davies a person in our employ was sent to Messrs Hankey s bank on his return a police-officer was sent for and she was taken into custody JONAS CLAPHAM I am an officer On the 26th of June I took the prisoner into custody she was pointed out to me and as soon as she saw me making towards her she attempted to run away I caught her at the end of Fenchurch-street and took her there - I inquired the charge from the last witness he said it was for a forgery on Hankeys I took her to the Mansion-house and searched her - before I searched her I saw her thrust her hand into her pocket in a hurried way and immediately took hold of her right arm - I found her fist clenched and opened it with great difficulty and there found two 20l and four 5l notes I marked the notes and delivered them to Mr Cope the marshall I marked them on the 27th before they were out of my custody - I will not swear they were not out of my hands before I marked them but they were not out of my sight - I believe they were not out of my hands I believe Mr Bush the solicitor looked at them in my hands - I considered myself responsible for them and that I ought not to lose sight of them I believe Mr Bush saw them in my hands - I have no recollection of delivering them into any person s hands I do not believe I did I was at the Mansion-house - I have no recollection of delivering them the notes there to anybody but that was the following day and I had marked them on the day I took them - before I went to the Mansion-house MR DAWSON Q Take these notes in your hand and say whether they are the notes A They are the same Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q What do you call them A Two 20l notes and four 5l notes - she put her hand into her pocket openly so as I could see her I was in my police dress at the time and close to her she must have seen me Q She did not attempt to swallow them A I did not give her that opportunity I supposed her to be between forty and fifty years old at that time but she is very much altered since WILLIAM SIMPSON re-examined I only entered the numbers of the notes which I paid not the dates the numbers are 5l 23 222 23 223 15 874 15 578 - and the 20l 10 695 and 813 the notes produced are those numbers The Cheque was here put in and read The prisoner being repeatedly desired by the Court and by her Counsel to enter upon her defence made no reply for some time but at last said The four corners of the earth and the strength of the hills is his also I said they were all going down to the Red Sea During the whole trial she kept distorting her feautures working her fingers about and conducting herself in an incoherent manner WILLIAM SIMPSON re-examined I cashed the cheque there was nothing of apparent incoherence in the prisoner s manner nothing of any rambling at all JOHN PAGET TREMLET I see the prisoner s manner now there was nothing of that sort of behaviour at the time of the transaction Cross-examined Q Will you swear a person may not be perfectly collected one hour and go perfectly mad the next A I will not swear it Q Have you not known instances of fever where a man may be perfectly sane the first forty years of his life and then go quite mad for five years and have his intellect all the rest of his life A I have heard of instances from fever there was certainly not any aberation of intellect while with me - she was rational and behaved as any sane person might have done - I don t think her mind was the least disturbed Witnesses for the Defence MARY ELIZABETH WRATTEN I am the daughter of the prisoner Some time ago my mother was carrying on business at Woolwich - I think she left it in the year 1831 - she had been carrying it on two or three years before - the house was once burnt down my mother slept at the top of the house I was not in the house at the time of the fire - my mother s conduct has been very strange indeed occasionally I have many times heard her threaten to put an end to herself sometimes she said she would hang herself at other times she said she would cut her throat we were always very much terrified at her threats Q What grounds did she allege for hanging herself or cutting her throat A The least irritation in her family she has behaved very violently towards us she used to throw herself upon the ground when she went off in these fits and I used to be afraid she would injure herself very much by so doing throwing herself about with very great violence since the fire I think the business has not been so good I assist occasionally in the business COURT Q Who conducted the business A My mother MR PHILLIPS Q Were you with her when she kept the Northumberland Arms A Occasionally I remember her taking a public-house in London she kept that only four months before she threw it up again - I never knew of any expectations we had of a large estate - I have seen her look as she does now on many occasions when throwing herself about only not looking so ill but she has exhibited that kind of manner many times - I must beg to say at the Northumberland Arms I irritated her slightly - I was going up stairs and she would have thrown me down if I had not caught by the bannisters I had given her very trifling irritation COURT Q Then the way she conducted herself at the Northumberland Arms was by violence A Yes generally after the violence was over perhaps she would turn to the action and manner she does now I have seen her use her hands as she does now before she was in custody after the violence was over Q How did you bring her to herself A We would keep her quiet a little while being desirous nobody should see her in that state I kept her as quiet as possible I sometimes made her sit down and sometimes lie down and then I humoured her the rest of the family saw her in that state but I was particular that the world should not see her Q You suffered her to go on and conduct the business as usual A Yes she had the whole management of the business to pay and receive money she cast up accounts saw the customers she drew bills and accepted bills - I occasionally thought she managed her business in a very strange way Q What instances can you state of any blunders in her business A In the management of her house she was anxious to remove from one place to another she was never satisfied above a week or a month in one house - we removed a number of times on that account - when we left the shop we moved to a cottage - we lived in the Northumberland Arms four months and in the other place where she did business eight years we lived in several other houses we moved to Greenhill-cottage and were there three months and then in King-street six months and in a cottage at Bow six months - she did not carry on business at all these places - she had given up the business at the Northumberland Arms - I think it was nearly twelve months and then she was anxious to go into business but against our wish and she took a small concern merely as we thought to amuse her mind it was in Church-street she kept a grocer s business there I cannot say whether there were any books kept there Q Are her affairs at all embarrassed A I think she had got into a very strange manner - I had no reason to think she had lost by business or was in debt MR PHILLIPS Q Did your mother lose property at the time of the fire A She lost a considerable quantity of property she was insured - I cannot tell whether she lost property independent of the insurance - yes she did it is two years since the fire I was sixteen years old at the time of the fire - I don t know that she has been unable to pay her bills since MR BODKIN Q Were you here yesterday A Not in court I was in the neighbourhood - brought here by my mother s friends I had told them what I knew about her state of health and mind I was not examined - I have seen her exhibit the symptoms she does now several times she has been precisely in this way several times and has continued so for some hours it has not always continued for days I have observed her strange for days but not violent - I have not seen her in this state for days - I have seen her for hours in the state she is in now I cannot say whether it has continued a whole day - it has not so violently I don t think it is many days since she was in this state indeed the morning she went away I thought there was a particular strangeness attending her I was at home that morning I was under an impression that she was out of her mind for a long time no medical men were ever called in to see the state of her mind - I did not conceive but what I could attend to her she went to town alone I think she walked down the road she took a parcel with her she told me she wished to see a gentleman on business in the Kent-road but at the same time I observed a very great lightness in her manner - she did not tell me she was going to receive a cheque or that she had received a letter from a friend with a cheque in it she took the shop that she had at the time this happened about two months after Christmas I think she received £1000 from the insurance office after the fire she lost her stock in trade books and every thing - to the best of my knowledge she told me she received £1000 from the insurance office - it was a month after the fire that she received it it must be more than two years ago I think it is three years Q At the time she kept the public-house at Westminster was your father in a situation at the docks at Woolwich A Yes he never came home in the week the business was entirely in my mother s management my father continues to hold the situation at this time - it occupies his time all day the business at Woolwich was managed by my mother she saw the tradesmenand purchased the articles - I don t think she gave any credit at that shop I did not attend to the business she managed it entirely herself COURT Q Was she strange in her conversation and manner at the same time A Yes she sometimes did extraordinary things when her mind seemed better on the morning she left home she jumped about very different to what she was accustomed - she moved about the house very quick and light her husband usually lived with her when he came home but she slept with me sometimes for I was afraid of her committing suicide she first slept with me soon after the fire I have been afraid of her committing suicide ever since the fire - I never expressed that idea even to my father but I wished her to sleep with me as he slept more sound than I did if she made the least move she would awake me I often got up and went to her room with some excuse for fear anything should happen Q Why did you allow her to go to town alone on this day A My father was so engaged he could only mind his own business at the docks I allowed her to go alone for many reasons - we have often said we would not let her go to town alone but it was driven off from time to time economy was one reason why we allowed her to go alone and if I went I could not transact the business she did as no gentleman would transact business with a young girl it was too expensive for me to go with her and I thought she could conduct the business without me it was of no moment I thought her competent to transact it MR PHILLIPS Q Has the business fallen off A It has come down to be not worth the name of business lately it was a small concern merely to occupy her time I have a sister and a brother who is thirteen years old FRANCES REEVE I am the prisoner s sister I remember her coming to Worcestershire to see her mother who was very ill - she came down on purpose to see her in the state of insanity she was in to the best of my recollection it is upwards of four years ago - she knew my mother was in a state of insanity before she came to see her - a few minutes after she came into the house she said she must be off again immediately she said she came to spend the time with her mother but instead of that she went to a neighbour s house and spent her time mostly my mother died in a state of insanity - she was in that state at times we were obliged to tie her down - her grandmother was in a raging state of insanity she was obliged to be chained and her aunt was insane several times and was chained down several times also MR BODKIN Q How long did she stay when she came to see her mother A I believe two days and two nights her mother was quite incapable of seeing or knowing anybody she came down alone travelled by the stage and took the stage from Pershore home - I cannot say whether she had seen her mother before she said she must go back again she had not been there many minutes - the neighbour s house is about a quarter of a mile from my mother s she came backwards and forwards - my mother had five children- the other three are living in good health Q And you have had no affliction of your mind A Not particularly so my head is very bad at times - I have violent pains in the head at times I have not got it now not more than a fortnight since my head was very bad - I have had my hair taken off twice I remember when the fire happened at my sister s house the last witness was at my house at the time - it happened the summer before the death of my mother - it is more than four years ago I live in Worcestershire - I have not been up to town for ten years - I have not seen her since she came to see my mother COURT Q When your mother or grandmother shewed symptoms of insanity have these symptoms been attended with violence A At times but not always they have been very quiet at times Q What strangeness of conduct did they exhibit A They could not answer any questions put to them - at times my aunt would assist in business and be outrageous at times her business was very trifling she had a husband living - she very seldom answered rationally at times when she was insane she would appear like other people but it would be gone in a few minutes for a few minutes she would be out of it and then in it immediately - she very seldom would speak when she was in it I have not been with the prisoner - I never heard of the prisoner being supposed to be insane till she was charged with this THOMAS WOOD About fifteen months ago I was assistant to the prisoner at the Northumberland Arms - she used to give me directions to dovarious things and then contradict those directions I remember her calling me and the female servant up at night - she said there were thieves in the cellar and she could hear them knock but we could hear no knocking though we were in the same room - I remember her on another occasion fancying there were thieves in the chimney and there was a fire in the grate at the time - she wanted to let the house after she had been in it a week I always thought she was out of her mind - she went about the house doing what business there was MR DAWSON Q When she said she heard the noise which you did not hear was her husband living in the house A He was not at home he was at Woolwich - she was in the parlour and said she heard the noise in the cellar - we stood in the parlour she called us up about three o clock in the morning - I was not with her when she first said she heard the noise she kept us in the parlour and said she could hear the noise underneath she then went to bed again - she was in bed and got up and came down and insisted that she heard the noise- she must have heard it first in her bed-room - on saying we did not hear the noise she went to bed I heard her come up after me she gave very little credit in the house she had the care of the till - she took care to lock it up either she or her daughter it was always locked up every night - I have frequently seen her lock it up - she seemed very careful of it always MR PHILLIPS Q Did she persist in it that she heard the noise of thieves knocking A She did - we could not hear the slightest knocking all the time she said it was going on THOMAS JAMES I am assistant to Mr Hitchcock a broker at Woolwich We let some furniture to the prisoner - I remember last winter calling with Mr Hitchcock for 3l which she owed him she stated that in ashort time she was coming to an estate and then would discharge that and return the furniture and buy new furniture - when she came down to us she was dressed quite in an indelicate state with her bosom quite exposed she had nothing except a little shawl on the back of her shoulders and her petticoat and shift on it was about eleven o clock in the day Hitchcock was a grown up man as I am she did not exhibit the slightest shame at being so exposed her bosom down to her waist was stark naked - I have heard her talk of coming to an estate at other times COURT Q In what terms did she talk of large property coming to her A She said she had a large sum of money and an estate in the country coming from some relative - I understood her that it was out of this large estate she was to pay the 3l MR BODKIN Q Did she pay the 3l A No never this was the beginning of last year it was for the hire of furniture - I called several times for my money but was not able to get it I believe I have seen her once since and asked her for the money she gave me the same tale that she was coming to a large estate and would pay Mr Hitchcock and buy new furniture Q What part of the house did you see her in A I was ushered into the parlour by a servant and waited for half an hour - I supposed she was not up she came down to speak to us in that state she did not present the appearance of a person coming down suddenly half dressed she had a flannel petticoat on and a shawl hastily thrown over her but had her bosom exposed she did not come down in a hurried manner - we were not expected to come that day - I cannot say whether she was aware who was to see her when she came down - nobody was in the parlour besides us it was a private-house not a public-house it was in Bow-water-crescent the servant let us in MR PHILLIPS Q Did you send the servant up to tell her you were waiting A No doubt she told her I asked for her mistress she had half an hour to dress if she chose Q Was not Mr Hitchcock so deaf that you were obliged to tell him what she said A At times he could hear better than at others I told him what she said MARY ELIZABETH WRATTEN re-examined Q Did you take your meals with the prisoner A Yes she did not drink spirits she might take a portion but not more than other people she did not take spirits every day she was by no means in the habit of taking spirits nor laudanum she was never intoxicated she would taste spirits if they were on the table THOMAS GOOK I am a constable Some time ago in the early part of last year I went with some companions to the Northumberland Arms kept by the prisoner - I went to spend about half an hour there with six or seven more persons I saw the prisoner there not one of us spent our money there for she behaved in that strange way the most inconsistent way possible - when we called for something she turned her back to us and we could not get a rational answer one our party said Why bring us here when we cannot get served we asked for liquor again and were more than half an hour in the house and then we went to another house as we could get nothing - four or five strangers left the house also who were calling for something and could not get served - I thought nobody in their senses would act so MR BODKIN Q Were you a constable of that district A No I had been at the House of Commons on duty Q I believe constables expect to be treated with very great respect at public-houses A No there were several persons in the tap-room one man with a pipe wanted a pint of porter and could not get served he went out with his pipe - three customers stood at the bar wishing to be served when I went in with seven others we could not get served and left MR PHILLIPS Q Did she turn her back to you instead of turning to you A Certainly I did not see her serve any customers at all it was about seven o clock in the evening COURT Q Did she appear to you to be sober A I do not think it was the act of a drunken person I fancied at the time it might be the case and watched her she went out of the bar into the tap-room persons spoke to her there and she returned to the bar without noticing them I said My good lady have the goodness to attend to us having to go back to the House of Commons again but I could get no answer MR PHILLIPS Q Did she reel or stagger as if tipsy A Certainly not I considered her manner to be from wildness of mind - I watched her thinking her drunk but my impression was entirely altered before I left the house DAVID UWINS ESQ M D I am a physician and live in Bedford-row - I have been twenty-five years in the profession I have had considerable experience in cases of insanity having been connected for the last five or six years with a lunatic establishment - I attended at the prison at the request of the prisoner s relatives to ascertain the state of her mind - I examined her three times I had some suspicion of acting at first - I endeavoured to ascertain as accurately as possible if that suspicion was correct - I have heard the evidence of the witnesses - from what they have stated and from my own observation I should say her intellect is by no means such as would be considered sound I should say she is in a state of feeble intellect - I should consider her an irresponsible being Q Should you be at all surprised at her committing suicide A No I should not be surprised at it - I have written on the subject of insanity - I distinctly state and maintain there is no possibility of drawing the line precisely between sanity and insanity that assuming a point of sanity is assuming a point which cannot exist - it is not possible in my opinion to point out where sanity ends and insanity begins - a person may be perfectly sane for a week and next week quite the reverse Q There have been I believe instances in this kingdom in which the mind has gone all at once and returned and very high duties have been performed A Certainly COURT Q That being the case would you not judge of the state of mind by the degree of contrivance exhibited at the time of a transaction should you deem a personinsane who appeared aware of what he was about and contrived and took measures for his own benefit A I cannot say that an act itself sane might not be coupled with insanity Q You have heard of the prisoner obtaining a writing and presenting one resembling it and obtaining through that a sum for her own benefit A I have heard of aberration of mind being manifested before that took place - I can conceive a great deal of contrivance in the process of effecting a design Q Would such a degree of contrivance be consistent with imbecility or idiotcy would it be consistent with the absence of reason A Among my patients at the Institution they have gone through the process of reasoning for the object they have in desire as a sane person would - the act itself I should not call an act of insanity but should conclude that an individual being insane could perform that act there may be considerable imbecility of mind and yet the process of reasoning exist - I conceive it possible for an individual to act as the prisoner did with respect to this cheque without knowing the degree of responsibility under which she herself must stand in reference to it Q Is it not within your experience that many persons partially insane are perfectly capable of knowing they are doing a wrong act A That more refers to cases of monomania Q Do you conceive all this stratagem might be employed without a consciousness of there being anything wrong in it A I conceive it possible having seen several instances where the object has been of less importance where the same process has gone on - I merely allude to this as matter of opinion and comparison - I should not pronounce that the prisoner was positively unconscious of a deviation from moral rectitude Q Should you hesitate to say that this act of the prisoner could be any other than the act of a reasonable mind A I could conceive it and from the circumstances of the case I must unequivocally state I should feel a reluctance in condemning her - the motive would considerably influence my opinion but it is impossible to state what the motive really was - persons partially insane at intervals are perfectly competent and sane at others Q Would you not judge of the state of mind by the act - supposing a person executed a will in every respect as a person of sound mind would it not lead you to conceive it was made in a sound state of mind A That would be a circumstance but it would not be conclusive MR PHILLIPS Q You have heard the evidence of her conduct within the last four years and observed her yourself and heard that her grandmother and aunt died in a state of insanity and the aunt raving mad do you think that at any time within the last two years it would be safe to trust her or that you would trust her with the management of property A Certainly not nor should I think any instrument she executed was valid - I think there are no proofs of her insanity at the time in question I don t think she was in a state to distinguish right from wrong at the time of this affair MR BODKIN Q Did you hear the witnesses examined yesterday after you had given your evidence A I did I heard Mr Mc Murdo examined - I have already admitted there was a good deal of feigning when I saw her in Newgate she appeared sensible of the importance of establishing her insanity I saw her a second time and still considered she was feigning I had some conversation with her solicitor and her friends before the third interview - my opinion became modified at the third interview I am not prepared to say she is decidedly insane - my opinion of her insanity is fully as strong as it was yesterday and stronger as I have heard the evidence on both sides the evidence given of her sanity did not weaken my opinion in the least - when there is any symptom of insanity we cannot suppose a person accountable - I should not admit the act performed by the prisoner was itself insane but if the party was insane the day or week before I should say the act though apparently a rational one might be the act of an insane person when we take into account the exceeding cunning connected with mental aberration especially where there is an intention to accomplish an object - supposing her to be insane before I do not think the transaction the result of insanity but consistent with insanity MR PHILLIPS Q Have you known persons labouring under insanity pursue an object with a cunning you would only expect from very clever persons A Certainly in the only instance of suicide which has occurred since I have been physician of the Asylum at Peckham the cunning evinced for months and weeks to accomplish the purpose would surprise every body COURT Q But that was an insane object A Yes MR PHILLIPS Q Whether the object was to the person s interest or prejudice have you known instances of their endeavouring to effect their purpose by means quite as cunning as you would expect from the highest order of intellect A Certainly I should say the object in view had some supposed good in contemplation COURT Q Is not the very act of suicide a symptom of insanity A With submission I do not entirely admit that it evinces an absence of moral principle but that is delinquency - I should say insanity prevented the individual from being fully sensible of the delinquency I should not allow a man to be insane that went from the gaming table and blew his brains out Q Where the object is obviously beneficial to the parties and they pursue every reasonable means to accomplish it is it not evidence of sanity rather than insanity A It is abstractedly but it might be quite the reverse Q How could you judge of a lucid interval except from the conduct of the party A It must last for a long time before I could guarantee its long continuance you cannot always determine an apparently lucid interval correctly but if it lasts a long time from acts of insanity I should determine it to be a lucid interval it would require a very long probation Q When a person acts with reference to the transaction in question exactly as anybody else would do why do you pronounce that person insane A Because we have heard the person was insane before in other instances - I do not come here as an advocate nor do I positively say she was not conscious of the delinquency of the vact Q Is there anything beyond what you have heard that leads you to suppose her deranged is there anything constitutional A I never could discover her breath tobe in a fetid state which is usually a characterestic feature of insanity MR BODKIN called the following witness THOMAS HALIFAX I am an apothecary at Woolwich a graduate in medicine I have attended the prisoner s family as a medical attendant - I was never called to attend her on the score of madness - I always considered her perfectly sound in mind I saw her in June last I think it was in June or the end of May I saw her at her own house and had some conversation with her relative to the receipt of some money she was to receive from a friend of her s and was to deliver to me - she had not then received the money but I had understood she had and had a conversation with her on the subject and on some other affairs relative to the family from whom it was to come - she explained the circumstances how she was to receive the money and explained my mistake why she had not it ready for me - it was a mistake on my part and she explained it - from that conversation I should say she was perfectly sound in mind as I have witnessed on former occasions I have known her seven or eight years - I have been the medical attendant of the family during the whole of that time - in my opinion her mind during the whole of that time has been perfectly correct and sound Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Have you heard the evidence given to day A I have I cannot say it shakes my opinion it creates a degree of doubt but in a very minute degree - such a degree of doubt that from such circumstances I should not form any opinion unless as I stated before I was in possession of circumstances connected with each fact enabling me to conclude - I said yesterday that it would shake my opinion but I modified my answer in the same manner that it would shake my opinion if unexplained - I said so to the best of my belief and that her grandmother mother and aunt dying in a state of raving insanity - her coming down to two young men with her person exposed and her imagining thieves were in the chimney while there was a fire in the grate - and that there was a knocking underneath when others could not hear was inconsistent with other facts - I did not say absolutely that it would shake my opinion - I said the mere facts would without any explanatory facts which might be offered - I came here to deliver the truth - I said I was a graduate in medicine by which I meant doctor of medicine - I considered doctor of medicine would be understood by that - I consider them synonymous - I have been in practice above ten years - I was graduated in Edinburgh - I am not a member of the College of Physicians in London - I have no connexion with any insane institution - my practice has not been considerable in public institutions for insane persons I have had under my own hands several cases - I cannot answer at the moment how many I have had within ten years - I have one under treatment at this instant an individual residing at Woolwich - I will not swear whether I have had five in this year or not - I believe Dr Uwins has an experience of two hundred a week - I did not visit the prisoner in prison - I consider a disorder of some intellectual faculty a symptom of insanity - monomania is insanity relative to one particular subject distinguished from a disordered intellect relative to all affairs Q In a person proved clearly insane at one time do you think it easy to distinguish when the process of insanity ceased A Unless I had some evident proof in language or wandering of thought or particular conduct I should not form an opinion on the subject it is known that insane persons have pursued an object of self-interest with a degree of cunning which belongs to very few except the most exalted talents but I should distinguish the conduct she exhibited at the time compared with previous conduct - the conduct of the prisoner previously would determine me as to the state of mind at the time - I consider a person sane at the time whose conduct is sane and whose view of things is the same as persons in their ordinary senses Q If they were a little mad before and after would not that influence you A It would depend on the conduct at the time I know of no means but comparison - I have visited Miles mad-house at Hoxton with a view to place a person there - my reading on insanity has been cursory I have read Dr Burrows work COURT Q You think the conduct of the individual would determine your opinion of the state of mind at the time A Yes FRANCIS PUPTER I am a baker and live at Woolwich I have been acquainted with the prisoner fourteen or fifteen years I had frequent opportunities of seeing her I had transactions with her in business and have lent her money - about nine years ago I lent her 100l to take a shop the first application was from her and then she and her husband came both together she told me the purpose she wanted it for - she and her husband were both together when I advanced the money my acquaintance continued till within three or four weeks of this matter - in all my intercourse with her she has appeared to conduct herself like a rational person there was nothing in her conduct to induce me to suppose that she was a person who could not distinguish right from wrong MR PHILLIPS Q Should you not be surprised at her coming down stairs to two men with her neck bare A Yes I should think it an act of indecency quite inconsistent with correctness of mind it would appear as if she was going rather astray - it would appear strange if she had told me there were thieves in the chimney while there was a fire in the grate - I saw her every day her habits were those of a regular quiet decent woman a woman as fit for business as any woman in the world she conducted the whole business herself Q If she turned her back on seven customers and obliged them to leave should you not think she was going a little astray A Yes it never was the case when she was at Woolwich I should imagine if she had done that thirteen months ago she was a very different woman to what she was when I knew her - I am not much acquainted with subjects of insanity MR BODKIN Q These circumstances would strike you as strange but if afterwards she conducted herself as before would that impression be removed A It might be so COURT Q Up to what time did you know her A I saw her about three weeks before she was taken into custody at my house at Woolwich - the Northumberland Arms is at Westminster - she lived in Woolwich when this matter happened WALTER SMITH I am an apprentice to Mr Andrews at Woolwich I have known the prisoner about five years I lived in her house till two years ago last June it was subsequent to the fire - she generally managed all the business Mr Wratten was in it a little in the evening - all the time I knew her she always conducted herself in a proper kind of way - I never saw her amiss - I never thought her anything out of the way or out of her mind - I have known her since I left her up to about four months I never thought she was insane she conducted herself like other people SAMUEL GARDNER I live at Deptford I am a grocer I have known the prisoner about fourteen years I have had considerable dealings with her in business she managed the business at Woolwich her husband never interfered she failed in 1830 - I knew her before that I knew her previous to the fire and by referring to my ledger to-day I find from 1826 until the time of the fire I had very considerable transactions with her - I have known her since the fire up to the present time - before and since the fire I have from time to time been concerned with her in business but not the whole time - my dealings have generally been with her or my young man has dealt with her she conducted herself always as a very rational and very clever woman in business she gave her orders and depended on my honour to serve her she gave orders in a business-like manner - she paid me in money she may have paid me bills but I never drew bills on her - I frequently settled accounts with her she understood them as far as was necessary in her business - at the time of the fire having received money from the fire-office she came and paid her debts and then commenced again and at that period I had a very high opinion of her and opened a new account she gave me an order to the amount of 160l and since that she has failed at the expiration of one year in November 1830 - on the 13th of February last she called to open a new account with me after having failed twice - I declined taking her order until security was offered - she was with me an hour or two securities were proposed by herself she named them - she brought her brother to my house as security and I did not accept it that was on another day - during these transactions she appeared perfectly conscious of what she was doing MR PHILLIPS Q Within what time did she fail twice A She failed in 1830 and again about twelve months ago - she failed in 1830 and 1832 - she had been in business a long time before - she never wanted to borrow money of me it was because I did not approve of the security that I would not open a fresh account with her if it had been only 5l I would not have given her credit for it nor for 1d not at that time - she has had a reverse of fortune - I trusted her for a year after the fire and she failed again - it was in February last - I would not trust her as I have lost 170l by her - I considered she had treated me ill - I trusted her after 1830 to the amount of 7l 5l of which has not been paid I thought her not trustworthy in February last MR BODKIN Q In February last did you call her attention to the 5l A I did and she said she would pay it some day when she failed her brother proposed to pay 5s in the pound for her she attended and explained the state of her affairs to her creditors but not at all to their satisfaction she explained it so as to make them understand it would be best to take the 5s JOHN BURKE I keep a tavern at Greenwich I have known the prisoner about seven years - I saw her last about nine months ago - I always considered her a very clever shrewd woman the whole time I knew her she called on me relative to taking the Ship tavern twelve months ago - she asked the usual questions went over the premises inquired the profits and every circumstance - she was there half an hour - in the inquiries she made she showed herself a particularly shrewd woman she inquired the profits and what business was done and the amount of business and what it would take to come in and every necessary question - from every thing I saw of her my opinion is that she was a very clever shrewd woman and of perfectly sound mind - her husband was with her but she undertook all the inquiry and her husband did not interfere Cross-examined Q I dare say she was the cleverest woman you ever saw in your life A She was HENRY MOODY I am a baker living at Woolwich I have known the prisoner ten years or more I have not had any particular dealings with her - I have seen her within the last four months I should think her a woman of perfectly sane mind and a very acute intelligent woman - I never observed anything to induce me to conceive to the contrary Cross-examined Q What should you think of her stripping and showing her naked bosom A It would appear very indelicate - it would appear rather strange if she attempted to persuade me there were thieves in a chimney and a fire in the grate I have spoken to her within the last two months prior to her committal and I have spoken to her in this court and at the last sessions and up to within a week of her committal she appeared a perfectly modest woman and particularly acute and intelligent Q Would you not be astonished at her turning her back against seven customers and driving them out of the place without taking their money A It is singular but many persons in trade are eccentric very likely she is one of them - at times there is something in trade which turns people eccentric - if she was not eccentric I should think it strange her turning her back on customers - I should think it very odd if she acted so MR BODKIN Q It would depend on what sort of customers came A Certainly THOMAS DANBY I am a grocer living in Whitechapel I am not at all aware of the prisoner s state of mind MR PHILLIPS Q Did you state yesterday that on one occasion she appeared to you to be strange in her manner A Yes she came to open an account with me six months ago I declined opening the account several times till at last she brought security - I stated I thought she was not capable of managing her business and I declined it because she appeared so exceedingly strange and exhibited such conduct begging for goods and crying and making such exclamations her manner was quite incoherent - I asked who was going to assist her in business she said her daughter - her manner appeared very much changed from that of her usual manner - I was subpoened to attend on the part of the prosecution COURT Q What sort of exclamation did she make use of was it the importunity of begging you to trust her A It might arise from that she called repeatedly for a fortnight and seemed very anxious to be served with goods imploring me to give her credit and that it should be paid - she did not complain of being refused credit elsewhere - she begged I would send goods in and she would pay me at the regular time - she seemed very much distressed at my making a difficulty about it and went about the room for an hour together wringing her hands and crying - I gave her credit at last - she was very different when she obtained her object she then appeared milder she appeared thankful and expressed herself so - she said she was going to have goods at a cheesemongers - she might have probably said it was important for her to have the goods - I let her have them because I got security for them - at one time the daughter came the only words the daughter used were We had better go away Mr Danby declines to give credit and the prisoner said she hoped I should change my mind MR GILBERT McMURDO I am the medical man employed in the gaol My attention has been called to the prisoner since she has been confined as to whether she was sane or otherwise - I was examined yesterday and said I would rather not give a positive opinion but rather thought she was feigning since that I have taken particular pains to ascertain her state of mind and from information I have received in her presence to-day I should say I consider her to be positively of sane mind - I was told in her presence of observations she has made relative to her trial she made no observations to me about it nor in my presence - I told her what I had heard of her since yesterday and of what she had said she appeared to understand me but would not answer - I told her that she had said to one of the nurses I know all that has passed in the Court and I said I understand Mrs Wratten although you behaved well to Mrs Ruthven up to this time yet in consequence of her evidence to-day you have behaved ill to her striking her and threatening her daughter by which it appears you fully understood her evidence she made no observation but she did not make the motion of her eye or the distortion of her face as she does now she appeared to know what I was saying but would not answer me - I have observed her manner at the bar she can conduct herself different at times in the gaol and when I was sitting in the box just now the moment I spoke to her to try the effect of my observation she instantly began to assume the position of the eye which has been observed she was perfectly right before and she began moving her mouth as she does now Q Then from your observations and from what passed you are of opinion she is not insane but of sound mind A That is my opinion I did not like to give so decided an opinion yesterday as I heard some of her relatives have been mad and we have understood that madness is hereditary SARAH RUTHVEN I am superintendant in the infirmary in Newgate my attention has been directed to the prisoner she has been principally under my care she never spoke to me until the day before yesterday - she then came into my room and seemed very cold I asked her to sit down and warm herself which she did and she then said she should like to tell me all about it - I asked what she meant and told her I wished she would tell me about it she then turned round and went out of the room and yesterday when she came out of Court she came up stairs in a dreadful rage and kicked over a bucket of water I said if she behaved so she must have on a straight jacket - she kicked me and became quite outrageous afterwards she came into my room and was dreadfully abusive to me saying it was all my doing that I was the wretch who had done it she did not say what I had been examined yesterday as to my observation of her conduct Q From the observations you made of her conduct and demeanour do you believe her insane or of sound mind A I shall always think she is of sound mind I really do - but I think she has been greatly distressed in mind owing to her situation she said she was quite aware of everything that was going on in court yesterday and I mentioned it to Mr McMurdo before her to-day she made no reply whatever ELIZABETH BROWN I am a sub-matron I have seen the prisoner several times - I considered she was not quite right in her mind but likewise considered she assumed a great deal more than is really the case I am of that opinion still I have spoken to her repeatedly she has not given me any answer I have found when she has thought she was not observed that she has been calm and collected in appearance but when she knew she was observed or I found she knew she was observed she put on all these grimaces and actions I saw her after coming out of court yesterday - I heard her making a great noise calling out murder I went up and saw her confined down on the bed she had kicked over a bucket of water and was very refractory she has been violent at times before and had the straight waistcoat on but she was much more violent when she came out of court than I had ever seen her before GUILTY Aged 50 -

I have a book of the orders for money in my possession for the different estates for which I am assignee - it was kept in my private room to which the prisoner had access - about the 15th of July I was going to part with the prisoner I had given him notice some time before but he requested I would allow him to remain a few days - he was to leave about the 15th of July - at that time I had all the orders belonging to this estate in my possession - I have the cheque-book here this cheque has originally been in that book - I have compared it with the margin they correspond exactly - the name G Gibson at the bottom of it is not my hand-writing - I know of no such person as Ogilby having made this indorsement - it is not in the handwriting of Ogilby who lives in Guildford-street - I believe it to be in the hand-writing of the prisoner - the signature Gibson is very like my hand-writing I think in some of the letters to that signature I can trace the handwriting of the prisoner I am inclined to think it is written by him from the character of one particular letter N - I never authorised him to sign my name to such an order as that - the orders are filled up all but the signature of the official assignee and indorsement and kept in a book cheque read MARY ANN MOLINEUX I am housekeeper at Mr Gibson s office I know the prisoner I recollect his being there but I don t know the day it was the last evening that I saw him there -

I could not go and recommended Young The prisoner in his defence stated that he was a foreigner and declared he had no intention to defraud the Bank and trusted that he should have the benefit of any discrepancy in the evidence GEORGE GIBSON The indorsement is not in the prisoner s usual hand-writing it is a little concealed and my signature is still more feigned -

t18330905-97  OLD COURT Saturday September 7 1833 First Middlesex Jury before Mr Justice Patteson 1300 DAVID DUNDAS was indicted for that he on the 8th of August at St Pancras feloniously did forge a certain order for payment of money which is as follows that is to say No London 10th June 1833 Messrs Drummond pay to Captain Dundas or bearer eighty pounds £80 Dundas with intent to defraud Andrew Berkeley Drummond and others against the statute &c 2ND COUNT for feloniously uttering a like forged order for payment of money well knowing it to be forged with a like intent 3RD COUNT for feloniously putting off a like forged order for payment of money well knowing it to have been forged with a like intent 4TH 5TH and 6TH COUNTS like 1st 2nd and 3rd only not setting out the forged instrument 6 OTHER COUNTS like the six former only stating the intent to be to defraud William Edmead MR BODKIN conducted the prosecution WILLIAM EDMEAD I live at No 29 Gower-place Euston-square The prisoner lodged at my house three or four months in 1829 and again for about the last twelve-months in 1829 and again for about the last twelve-months - he had incurred a debt of 49l 10s with me for lodging and paid me by a bill of exchange which would become due on the 17th of August last - I paid it away - on the 8th of August he sent for me up-stairs I went up and he said Here Mr Edmead is your account - there was another quarter s account about coming due and that was the account he referred to - he produced the quarter s account including the bill I have it here this is the paper I received from him here is bill 48l mentioned but it should be 49l 10s the account was 17l 12s making the whole 67l 2s - on his producing the account he placed a cheque on the account this is the cheque and he said Here is this I have some pressing letters to go into the country and I shall be absent about three weeks I think I shall be obliged to go off about seven o clock in the evening I am going into the city to the Bank should I have time to return before I go off into the country I will return and take up the bill and call upon you and settle your account and take this again - I had paid the bill away and he knew where it was - he said I have reserved this for a certain purpose I did not want to make use of it immediately - this passed about twelve o clock in the day the cheque was laying on the account all this time - I took the cheque up with the account and said I would take care of it I then left him - I went up again about an hour after he still remained at home I went up and told him he had made a mistake in the amount of the bill he said Never mind Mr Edmead that is of little consequence I have a fifty for it - he went out about two o clock and in a short time a boy came for his portmanteau I went up-stairs myself to fetch it down and found all that there was in the room nearly was put into the portmanteau except a pair of shoes and boots they were packed in the portmanteau - I brought it down stairs and gave it to the boy he took it down towards Euston-square the same way as the prisoner went - in consequence of what I observed up-stairs I was induced to present the cheque and I went that day to Drummond s banking-house presented the cheque and payment was refused - he went by the name of Captain Dundas at my house Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Are you quite sure you have told us all that occurred between you and him when he delivered you the cheque A Not quite he asked me where Moggridge lived at the time he gave me the cheque I told him and he took down his address - I am quite sure when he gave me the cheque he did not say This is not for payment - the cheque is for 80l the amount he owed me altogether was 67l when the bill became due and the quarter s account the bill had not become due then - if it had been due there would be a balance owing to the prisoner if the cheque was paid the bill was 49l 10s and the account was 17l 12s which would be 67l owing to me - there would be a balance of 12l 18s he did not ask me for the difference he did not tell me he gave it me as a security nor anything of the kind - he told me he intended to call for it again he did not say he would call for the cheque again if the bill was not paid this was on the 8th of August - I am quite sure he did not say Remember I wish to have that back again Q Did he not say he intended to have the cheque back again or words to that effect A Yes I replied Very well I will take care of it MR BODKIN Q Was that when he said he would get back about seven o clock from the City if he could A Yes he did not return at all that day - Moggridge is the person in whose hands the bill was it was the prisoner s acceptance drawn and accepted by himself he drew the bill I signed it and he accepted it - I am a baker THOMAS ANDREW RUSH I am a clerk in the house of Messrs Andrew Drummond and others there are more than two partners besides him - on the 8th of August I was at the banking-house Mr Edmead presented this cheque it appears a very strong resemblance to Lord Dundas s hand-writing - I was struck at the first appearance of it as being something different but I went and examined it and inquired the opinion of others and eventually declined paying it - Lord Dundas had an account at our house at the time and that is the form in which he draws his cheques and a very good imitation of his signature Cross-examined Q Yet something struck you that it was different A Yes THOMAS LINDIGREEN I am a policeman I was called on the 8th of August and took the prisoner into custody at the corner of Hampstead-road in the New-road at the King s Head public-house - a solicitor who was with me said I give this man into custody for forging a cheque of 80l - the prisoner heard it but said nothing I took him to the station-house searched him and found a quantity of memorandums sixty-three pawnbrokers duplicates ard a cheque-book of Drummonds and 3 cheques of it filled up - this is one of the cheques which I found looking at it RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD DUNDAS I keep an account at Drummond s house and have always done so - I believe I once saw the prisoner in the street he presented a paper to me I don t recollect the contents but from the contents of the paper I presumed he might be a Mr David Dundas who had corresponded with me I have had letters from him but have no other knowledge of him - no part of this cheque is my hand-writing I think I should know anywhere that it is not my hand - I don t draw on these cheques I have a private cheque-book of my own unless I receive money in the banking house I don t sign these cheques - the signature is made in the way I sign my name it is an imitation but I should discover it in a moment looking at another cheque this other cheque is still less like mine it is not the way I sign cheques it is the way I sign franks - Ihave had several letters from the prisoner and corresponded with him I probably franked my answers Cross-examined Q Is your Lordship prepared to say that this is an imitation of your hand-writing A I cannot answer that more than another person I imagine it being signed Dundas is intended to imitate my signature - I should say the last cheque would not deceive anybody that is for 40l the other might deceive but not a very accurate observer - it ought not to deceive a person used to my signature because I invariably draw a line and join the D s MR BODKIN Q Is it a different signature to that with which you draw a cheque A Yes the tail of the D comes through it and joins the u which I do in franks cheque read Prisoner s Defence written My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - Painfully distressing as my present position is arraigned a prisoner at this bar - a spectacle to the world charged with the intention to commit a frand on the Messrs Drummonds Gentlemen my conscience prompts me to reprobate that which I feel to be a vile attack on a character which I have in varied climes maintained without blemish for a period of more than thirty years in the service of my king and country having throughout the whole course of my professional duties uniformly received the high commendations of all under whom I had the honour to serve I do not name my services Gentlemen with any view of moving your pity nor would I had I the power attempt to excite your sympathies to shield me from any pains or penalties an error in judgment may bring upon me- they are altogether of a secondary consideration inasmuch as an incurable wound was inflicted the moment of my arrest nor will your verdict of acquittal heal that wound or give me back my peace of mind or allow me again to taste the sweets of social intercourse or evermore to feel the sacred influence of friendship - under such depression the sufferer sighs for his final release to meet the righteous sentence of the Judge Eternal In looking however at the evidence given by Edmead I wish you Gentlemen to favour me with your undivided attention to a few points which from their tendency it appears to be imperative in me to notice Bear in mind then that the transaction in question took place after mid-day on the 8th of August and that I was arrested soon after four o clock the same afternoon This man has sworn Gentlemen that he assented to hold the cheque as a collateral security until I took up a certain named bill coming due on the 15th of the same month Such was our specific agreement He has admitted on his oath that he promised to keep this cheque in safe custody and to restore it to me at the time already named He again tells you Gentlemen that the impression or understanding of his mind was that the bill should be taken up on that day a week before it was due and his account to be liquidated that night Admitting then for a moment the truth of the latter statement which I deny in the most unqualified manner Examine however this man s conduct do you see him acting agreeably to his own shewing Certainly not You must fancy him flying on the wings of the wind to the banking-house at Charing-cross Mark his laudable purpose was it to satisfy himself of the validity of the document The clerk of Messrs Drummond s answers no that he required payment for that which he has sworn he promised to keep in safe custody for a fixed and positive period I can easily imagine with what chuckling exultation he would bound away with the honest hope of realizing by his breach of faith the sum of £80 for a debt of £17 odd All this was done and my caption made in little more than two hours hence it is manifest that his determination was that I should not have the power to do as he has stated he expected me to do This witness however has had honesty sufficient to state on his oath that I refused to accept any money consideration for this document and admits that I enjoined him over and over again not to let the cheque go out of his possession his answer was I will not He has further sworn that when I gave him the cheque no person or party was named or even alluded to so as to give him any idea or reason to think that the document emanated from any person but myself for it bears no other than my own name I think I may then fearlessly ask you Gentlemen where is the evidence in all this to show even a shadow of criminal intention on my part towards the Messrs Drummonds Rather would not justice have been more fully satisfied had this man Edmead whose conduct herein was based on treachery and falsehood been put to the bar in preference to the witness box I shall therefore leave my destiny to the decision of your impartial judgment My conduct in this particular instance may not have been in exact accordance with the requirement of the laws but I submit that there is not a tittle of evidence to justify the charge of guilty intention on my part towards any of the individuals named in this indictment I appeal then Gentlemen to your own feelings assured that you will conscientiously view all the bearings of the case and by your verdict show to the world that you cannot sanction such abandonment of principle or make me the victim of such nefarious conduct GUILTY Aged 50 -

t18331017-128  1534 JOSEPH KAY was indicted for that he on the 31st of August at St Mary-le-bow feloniously did forge a certain order for payment of money which is as follows - London August 30 1833 E 204 No 11 Mansion-house-street Sir John William Lubbock Bart Forster Clarke and Co pay to Mr Walker or bearer Three Hundred and Forty-eight Pounds £348 DUTTON THOMAS With intent to defraud Sir John William Lubbock Bart and others 2ND COUNT for uttering a like forged order for payment of money knowing it to be forged with the like intent 14 OTHER COUNTS varying the manner of stating the charge and stating his intent to be to defraud Thomas Dutton MESSRS BODKIN and LEE conducted the prosecution CHARLES PELL I am a clerk in the banking-house of Sir John William Lubbock Bart and three others in Mansion-house-street I recollect this cheque being presented on the 31st of August and I paid the amount mentioned in it myself £348 I paid a £200 note No 3556 a £100 note No 4639 a £40 note No 16 904 and a £5 note 2662 and 3l in money - the cheque was presented by a man I believe but I don t recollect - I have not got the dates of the notes - I should think it was between eleven and twelve o clock in the day Q On looking at the cheque are you able to say it is one of the cheques which is generally in the books delivered to your customers A It is when we deliver books to our customers there are no two alike delivered from our house - the same number of cheques is inserted but not the same letter - the number and initial of the particular customer is entered into a book kept for that purpose - the number and initial on this cheque is the numbers and intitial of the prosecutor s cheques he keeps cash at our house forty-eight cheques were in the book delivered out to Mr Dutton looking at the book this is the book issued by the firm to Mr Dutton containing forty eight cheques - it bears the number and initial of which I have spoken Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Is the initial and number marked on every cheque here or only on the book A On every cheque - I don t give the books out myself any of the cashiers give them out GEORGE WILLIAM TURNER I am a paper-maker andlive at Bermondsey I am a friend to Mr Dutton and frequently assist him in his cash transactions - he needed assistance in filling up cheques being infirm - I know this is the cheque book which he had - I have understood that the prisoner who was in his service occasionally filled up cheques for him - I have not seen him do it I have seen the prisoner write looking at the body of some cheques there are twelve of these I cannot speak to every one of them but to many of them I can I can only speak to the best of my belief that the body of them is in his hand writing not the signature I don t know whose hand-writing the others are many of these are in my hand-writing but not all the three first are mine I may trace the similarity I believe the name Mr Walker on the cheque in question to be the prisoner s hand-writing - I was present when the prisoner was dismissed from Mr Dutton s service on the 23rd of August - he left the service that evening Mr Dutton s brother paid him his wages in my presence Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q What were you to Mr Dutton A A friend of his in business he has been in business - I was a mere friend of his - I was in business myself I live at Bermondsey I often called to see how his health was going on and on those occasions he has asked me to fill up cheques for him Q Were you then a sort of friend who occasionally dropped in and filled up cheques A Not exactly so he was aware of my periodical visits - I have said I will call on you in three or four days or in the course of next week and if he had occasion for my assistance he waited till I came - he is in a very prostrate state of health - the cheques I have said are in the prisoner s hand-writing I mean are in his ordinary hand - that name Mr Walker is an endeavour at concealment - I consider it bears a strong resemblance to his writing I consider there is a very strong similarity in the word Wages and Walker on the cheque in question and I should say in this cheque there is an A very much like it evidently the same hand bearing in mind the endeavour at concealment - I consider the same faculty that formed the one formed the other Q Do you judge that it is the feigned hand-writing of the prisoner because of what you suppose to be the general resemblance to the eight cheques A Yes I do mean so - on comparing it with his accounts and what I saw him write I suppose it is his - the cheque is an effort at disguise which I have discovered to be his hand-writing from its similarity to his ordinary handwriting Q Might not that be just as likely to have happened from some other person endeavouring to imitate the prisoner s hand as if he were endeavouring to disguise it A It is not for me to say I feel it difficult to arrive at any other conclusion than that it is his - Mr Dutton s housekeeper was not in the habit of filling up cheques to my knowledge - I have seen one or two entered in the margin as being filled up by other people - I do not like to venture to say these four cheques are the prisoner s writing so positively as the other eight because I thought they did not bear so strong a resemblance but I believe these also to be his hand-writing- I saw the prisoner write on the 23rd of August when he was paid off but never before to my recollection he then wrote in this book Wages ill bestowed - ten guineas to the fool debtor £12 - received the above - I saw him write that I was at his elbow at the time - that was all I ever saw him write - I did not see him write the ten guineas only the two lines I saw him write it altogether it is a receipt for his own wages - looking at the cheque and the book - I judge these to be both written by the same hand I have no other means of judging - it is from the similarity that I judge it to be his hand-writing COURT Q And that a single instance A But I am bound to observe my Lord the prisoner acknowledged the whole book to be his hand-writing - I compared the book my knowledge is not formed from comparison of what I saw him write but by a comparison of the book which I heard him acknowledge MR CLARKSON Q Look at the Wa in the word Wages and look at the Wa in the word Walker and tell us is there the least similarity A The W is not so much alike as in other places COURT Q Is not one stiff straight writing and the other flourishing A Yes there is a peculiar flourish at the end of the W of his own writing - the one is upright and the other sloping - one sloping and the other stiff - one with a flourish and the other without MR CLARKSON Q And from that dissimilarity you trace the likeness A With the reservation I have already stated MR BODKIN Q At the time he wrote that flourishing hand was he sober or not A He was not exactly sober he has been reported drunk - he was nearly sober and knew perfectly well what he was about he appeared to have been taking liquor more than was proper ALGERNON BUTTERFIELD I am a clerk in the employ of Sir John Lubbock and Co I have the dates of two of the notes I made the entry in the book myself - I did not see the notes paid for the cheque Q Have you a £200 note entered A Yes on the the 29th of August No 3556 dated August 8th 1833 - the £200 note was received by me at the bank the £100 note was No 4639 dated 25th of March 1833 Manchester Branch Bank - I did not receive this note these two notes were in our house - the £200 was in the house on the 29th of August and the £100 on the 30th MR CLARKSON Q Did you see them there A They passed through my hands - I copied them into the book on the 30th of August COURT Q That entry was made from the notes themselves A Yes that proves a note of that number and amount was in the house that day JOHN KIDNER TATHAM I am clerk in the pay-office in the Bank of England I recollect paying gold for four notes on the 30th of August - notes to the amount of 345l were presented for sovereigns at one time - these are the notes so presented - they are £200 No 3556 dated 8th August £100 No 4639 25th March 1833 - the others are £40 No 16909 18th July 1833 and £5 No 8662 2nd July 1833 - they were presented about twelve o clock to the best of my recollection or between eleven and twelve o clock by a female who gave the nameof Walker Holloway-house Portsmouth as stated on the note - I did not see the person write that on the note - there is also on the note 68 Holborn I wrote that myself wishing her to give me a town residence Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you ask for a town residence whether the persons lives in London or not A Yes as a reference MR THOMAS DUTTON I live at Upper Clapton - the prisoner was in my service to attend on my person he was in my service twelve months all but one week he left on the 30th of August - in consequence of infirmity I am occasionally obliged to have assistance when I draw cheques - the prisoner assisted me on those occasions - I sometimes employed him to fill up the body of cheques when not able myself - I kept my cheques in a drawer of the sideboard - he had access to all parts of the house - my custom is to enter the name and sum in the margin of the cheque - I always filled up my cheques with my name in them and those who I pay money to I generally enter in the margin - for any large amount I generally have a banker s name written across my cheques but sometimes with persons requiring small amounts I did not - this is the cheque-book I had in use during the time the prisoner was in my service I never counted how many cheques it contained - I have not myself looked at the margin of the cheques - Mr Turner and my solicitor have examined them - this cheque is not signed by me - I gave no authority to fill up any such cheque I had no such sum to pay to a man named Walker - I don t know anybody of the name of Walker - I had no such a sum to pay to anybody - I have seen the prisoner write I do sincerely believe the filling up of the body of this cheque to be his hand-writing - I can say positively it is as far as I can judge one thing from another I should swear it is the prisoner s hand-writing to the best of my belief and knowledge - I have often seen him write - I saw these twelve cheques filled up by the prisoner by my authority - the writing on this paper is not mine it is very much like it I saw it before the magistrate - I can positively swear it is not mine I never saw it till I saw it at the Justice s room it is a very capital imitation - the prisoner was discharged from my service on the 23rd of August - he gave me warning six weeks before because I would not take his work and tired me out and he said he should want no character as he was going to live where his wife lived - he gave me no address - Mr Turner and my brother were there at the time Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q The prisoner sometimes filled up cheques for you did anybody else fill them up A Yes Turner and my brother has occasionally - I think Mr Norris has done so and my friend Cane I sometimes used to discount bills for and he filled them up that was only in four instances - my housekeeper never filled them up to my knowledge - I never had my name written on a bit of paper when I had my cheques filled up I put a pen sometimes on a cheque to bend the point down - I never wrote my name on paper before I wrote it on the cheque my memory is very good though I am so infirm - looking at two cheques - the prisoner filled up the first of these two cheques and my brother the second that I am sure of - looking at some more cheques - Mr Turner filled up some of these and Mr Norris some - I don t see any of the prisoner s filling up here there is only one of the prisoner s filling up in the whole bundle - I am confident the cheque in question is in the prisoner s hand-writing the whole of it name and all August the 30th and everything though it is disguised - I did not say at the Mansion-house I could not swear to it I said it was the prisoner s to the best of my belief - I speak from my own knowledge of his hand-writing - he produced his accounts to me very frequently and I saw him write when he wrote cheques for me that is all I have seen of his writing - the name Walker is in his usual hand-writing the 348 is attempted to be disguised the August and the rest is more like his free writing - I have no doubt of every letter being his hand-writing from my knowledge of his writing SAMUEL DUTTON I am the prosecutor s brother and live at Ludgate-hill about six weeks before the prisoner left his service I was there a complaint was made and notice was given I afterwards attended when his accounts were audited by me - when the prisoner left he did not tell me where he was going - he said he did not want a character that he was going to live with his wife and I think at Lady Hatton s at Harford he said he was going to live at Harford with his wife - I never saw him write except at the time he was paid MARGARET MINTO I am housemaid to Mr Thomas Dutton I went into his service on the 25th of June - I remained there till the prisoner left on the 23rd of August I have seen the prisoner writing on one occasion in particular - that was a month or five weeks before he left - it was between ten and two o clock in the day - he was writing on a small piece of paper in the kitchen there was a knock heard for the porter - he was called up to Mr Dutton he took the paper into the back kitchen and threw it down there - I picked it up I don t know what has become of it - I threw it down again not thinking it of any consequence - I have never seen it since I have been in the room several times since I have never seen it - I threw it where I picked it up by the side of the window it was in a place where it would be swept away I have not looked to see if it has been swept away but I am conscious it is not there for the place is swept twice a week - I have swept it myself all over - I have not seen the paper since I must have seen it if it had been there - I should know the paper again if I saw it looking at a piece torn in half neither of these is the paper but the hand-writing is exactly the same I did not make any observations to him about what I had seen MR BODKIN Q Did the prisoner ever show you any cheques singed by Mr Dutton A Yes he made no observations except asking if I was not surprised at the hand-writing being so good I have heard the prisoner talk of going abroad to America - that was not more than a fortnight before he left he said he should go to America the cook said many people went there with an idea of making a fortune and found their mistake he said people did not do as they ought to do they should go with a little money which they could do without and speculate I have seen the prisoner write several times -I have seen him write different hand-writings I can form a judgment of some of his writing and some I can not - I think the W in the name of Walker in this cheque is his I have seen this cheque before COURT Q Have you heard the observation made by any one else A No I have no opinion of any thing more than the W Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q The W is the sort of W he usually makes A It is the W I have often seen him make but he makes different ones I was not before the Lord Mayor nor a magistrate at all JOHN HANCOCK I am a printer and engraver employed by Lubbock and Co to make their cheque books this book was made up by me - I made only one of that description - that is there are some with two quires and some more this originally contained forty-eight cheques - I see two of them have been pulled out margin and all - I have not a doubt but this cheque is one of the forty-eight Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You are called to show that this is one of the books you supply to bankers A Yes there are two-quire books and three quires this is one quire there is only one book of one quire and the number and letter is the same all through the E 242 is put on at our house COURT Q Is there different numbers and sizes of your books A No they are sent into the banking-house and we have one hundred and fifty back to stamp MR BODKIN Q Did you make any other book of this size marked with E 242 A No WILLIAM KING I live at No 17 Marylebone-lane I know the prisoner I first saw him in July I believe I saw him with his wife after she had taken my lodging he came to my house on the Tuesday I cannot say the date he paid me on the Thursday and came to me on the Tuesday - about the 27th of August was the day he came to me his wife had taken the lodging before and had left it - he came on the 27th of August and stopped there a week he slept at home on the Friday night to the best of my belief and went out on Saturday morning the 31st and came home I think between one and two o clock in the day he was lodging in the first floor back room he left on the Sunday morning and returned on Monday morning accompanied by his wife - on the Tuesday morning about eight o clock a cart came to the door - I had no notice of his intention to leave my lodging before that the cart was brought to receive his goods I bought some of him and the rest were taken away he did not tell me where he was going I did not ask him he had before that told me he should go to America for he could live better there than he could here- when he came to me the first time he was in a cab he was dressed to the best of my recollection with black crape round his hat he said his master was dead that he had signed a will but he did not know that he should get anything for his trouble Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Are you sure it was Saturday about two o clock in the afternoon that he came home A Yes it was a remarkable day because a lady I serve went to Colchester that day and it poured of rain all day - I am confident it was not Friday - he was wet through when he came in ANN KING I am the wife of William King I recollect the prisoner coming to our house on Tuesday the 27th of August - and on the following Saturday the 31st he requested me to light a fire between two and three o clock - it was a very wet day and he was very wet - he went out while I was lighting the fire and returned - he gave me a japanned box out of his drawer it was not quite so large as that book pointing to one and about the width of it and I dare say it was five or six inches deep he pulled a key out of his pocket opened it and showed me what was in it which was a great many sovereigns - I cannot say how many COURT Q Was there more than 100 A I dare say there was but I cannot say the quantity MR LEE Q Was the box half full or fuller A Not a quarter full I could not see the bottom of the box when he stirred them about COURT Q Was the top of the box wide open A Yes he produced it to shew them to me and he asked me to feel the weight of them and I did so they appeared very heavy and I said to him They must be worth something they are very heavy he made no answer at all he did not say how he got them - I recollect his leaving on Sunday morning the 1st of September he said he was going to fetch his wife home GEORGE COOK I am coachman to Miss Hatton of Harford The prisoner s wife was in her service - I remember his coming down on Sunday the 1st of September - I did not know his wife was going to leave until then - they left together on the Monday morning - I saw them get into the coach myself they were inside passengers - John Carter drove the coach - he is ill WILLIAM POOLE I am a carter in the employ of Mr Baker of Salmon-lane Limehouse - I recollect going with Thompson to the prisoner s lodging and fetching away some goods - I saw the prisoner there - I took the goods to Gill-street Limehouse JOHN THOMPSON I am a lodging-house keeper and rigger a striker and lumper I take goods on board ships - I first became acquainted with the prisoner two years ago I moved some goods of his to my house with the carman - the prisoner and his wife then came and lived at my house - I cannot tell for what purpose they came to my house - I was on board a vessel the Mars brigg which trades to Jamaica when he came to me - I was with him on board the James Harris which goes to Van Dieman s Land - she was preparing for an outward voyage - she did not sail for a month afterwards - she took passengers out MR ADOLPHUS Q Did the prisoner bear an honest character A Very DANIEL FORRESTER I am a police-officer On the 16th of September I took the prisoner into custody I did not tell him the charge - I found him at No 23 Gill-street Limehouse at the house of Thompson - I searched his person and found on him a purse and several papers which I took from his pocket looking at one I found this not on his person but in his room I took the purse from his pocket I think there were four pieces and a card and when I laid down this paper he snatched it up and crumpled it I said Leave them alone - I took them from his hand this is the paper itwas crumpled up - I have inquired at No 68 Holborn for a person named Walker The cheque was here put in and read The paper in question had the name of Dutton and Thomas written on it three times Prisoner s Defence I leave it all to my counsel Charles York butler at the Albion Club-house St James Street Edward Reeves clerk No 16 Lawrence Pountneyhill Elizabeth Ransfield and Mary Marchant of Upper Clapton gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 32 -

Dr Burney has an account at our house - I stopped the prisoner and gave him into custody to an officer he said his name was Richard Davis at first and said he had the cheque from a Mr Jones and that he was to meet Jones at Woolwich - he said he had the cheque ot get the money and take it to Mr Jones that he was very slightly acquainted with Mr Jones - Dr Burney s Christian names are Charles Parr - in consequence of some circumstances Dr Burney had altered his mode of drawing by an agreement with our house which I understood - the prisoner said he was to meet Mr Jones at the Barrack Tavern that evening or early the next morning the Barrack Tavern is on Woolwich Common - I went with him to Woolwich the same day in company with the officer and some others - I did not go to the tavern myself - I do not know anything of a Mr Jones - I thought the signature was a forgery both from the want of likeness to Dr Burney s hand-writing and from theomission of what was the understanding between us about all his cheques Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q I believe it is the custom of your house not to pay any cheques not written in full A They are all written instead of being printed - Dr Burney does not write different hands it bears a very general similarity throughout COURT Q Do you mean that Dr Burney s hand does or that this paper does A No Dr Burney s hand does MR CLARKSON Q There is no difficulty in deciphering what is his hand-writing A Generally speaking there is a great similarity - We have before paid drafts which were not his which purported to be his - I had never seen the prisoner before to my knowledge I did not receive the cheque from the prisoner s hand - I was close to the person to whom it was presented and saw it presented by the prisoner - Geroge Lock is the person to whom it was presented he is not here - the prisoner said he received it from a Mr Jones I went to Woolwich with him he said that he was to meet Jones at the Barrack Tavern - I did not go to the tavern - I did not inquire for Mr Jones at Woolwich - I have not had the cheque in my own individual keeping when I received it I made such an inspection of it as enables me to say it is the same cheque - I was in the act of paying money at the time - it was put into my hands by Lock MR ADOLPHUS Q And did you see the prisoner put it into his hand A I did I had some conversation with the prisoner about it after he was in another room - the cheque was present and he knew of what cheque I spoke it was the same cheque as Lock had put into my hand DR CHARLES PARR BURNEY Not a letter of this cheque is in my hand-writing I never in my life authorised anybody to write it Cross-examined Q Does it occasionally happen that your hand varies A Not more than your s or anybody else s I perhaps may have mistaken my own hand-writing but never when I wrote a cheque Q Can you take upon yourself to say you have not had an occasion when you have doubted about that being your writing which ultimately turned out to be so A The circumstance I believe to which you refer is this another cheque was presented at Child s that cheque was returned to me as wanting the private mark agreed on by the bankers and myself on receiving the cheque I never troubled myself to see if it was real or forged I simply looked to see if the mark agreed on was there or not finding it was not there I knew I had not drawn the cheque and substituted for the cheque another with the mark - I never looked as to whether it was my hand-writing or not it was returned to me simply as requiring that particular mark - I looked at it and thought I destroyed the cheque but I destroyed only half of it and on looking among some letters this half cheque was found I suppose that is what the allusion is made to MR ADOLPHUS Q Allowing for a difference in sickness or health or any accident can you tell your own handwriting as well as other men can tell A I have no doubt of it I swear this is not my hand-writing DANIEL FORRESTER I am a city-officer The prisoner was delivered to me by Mr Wormald and Chadwick JOHN CHADWICK I am the policeman into whose custody the prisoner was delivered when stopped at Childs - I heard the question asked him about receiving the cheque he said he had received it from a person named Jones on the Tuesday - I did not go to Woolwich - I delivered him to Forrester - Child s is No 1 Fleet-street on this side of Temple Bar DANIEL FORRESTER re-examined The prisoner was delivered into my custody at Guildhall - I went to Woolwich with him because he said he had received this cheque from Jones on Woolwich Common Q In any house or street A On the common he was to meet Jones there that evening Thursday about half-past seven o clock or next morning about ten o clock I went to the Barrack Tavern with him into a room which looked on the common we waited till about half-past five o clock I said Do you think he will come into a lower room if so we will go down stairs and we went down stairs - no Jones appeared - he said he did not know him before he did not say he had seen him at the tavern - we waited till about half-past five o clock - something was said about the coach starting he said I do not think it worth while waiting any longer I said Mind I will stay here if it is until nine o clock he said No I do not think it is of any use waiting any longer he said nothing about going the next morning I took this piece of paper from his person here are some figures on it he said the person gave it him and that was how he was to get it cashed I asked him as to the hand-writing on the back of it he said he did not know there was any there if there was it must be there when given to him Q Did he say anything about the man meeting him on the Common and giving him the cheque A No he said he had been to the Barrack Tavern on the Tuesday afternoon with Mr Imms - I asked if Imms saw him with the man he said No he did not think he did as it was after he came out of the tavern Cross-examined Q The paper he said was handed to him by Jones when he gave him the cheque describing how he was to get it changed A Yes I beg to state the prisoner did not ask for any person named Jones in my presence while I was at the tavern - I asked the waiter if he knew such a person as Jones he said No The cheque was here put in and read GEORGE IMMS I know the prisoner - I am superintendent at Woolwich and collector to the Gas Light Company - I have frequently seen the prisoner write I should say the figures in ink on this paper decidedly are not his hand-writing I am not so positive as to the other- I would not take on myself to swear they were his - I should say no part of it was his - I do not know whose hand-writing it is Cross-examined Q Had you been on the Common with him on the day he states A I was on Woolwich Common with him on Monday the 26th of August and we went together to the Barrack Tavern - I occasionally parted from him - I ought to have explained- he was to have dined with me on Sunday and did not come he came on Monday - as soon as I finished dinner I said Now Corbett I must go collecting will you go on making out accounts or go with me he said My mind is in such a state I cannot sit at books I will walk with you - he went with me - I went into different houses collecting and left him outside - he had been disappointed in a situation - I have known him sixteen or eighteen years - I should think his age is about thirty-six Q During the whole time you have known him has he borne an irresproachable character A If he had not I would not have employed him - I have treated him as a brother COURT Q Has he borne a good character A I believe he has MR ADOLPHUS Q It was Monday the 26th of August when you asked him to dinner A Yes he did not tell me he had a cheque about him dated the 28th of August MR WORMALD re-examined He presented the cheque on Thursday the 29th of August Lieutenant William Mears of Greenwich Henry Mitchell publican of Greenwich and Thomas Marshall overseer of the parish of St Paul Deptford gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY of uttering the forged order knowing it to be forged -

I have the probate of the will of Mrs Mary Martin late of Beaconsfield - I am under that will trustee of some money left for the benefit of her niece who is the wife of the prisoner - the sum was 1 600l in money which was invested in the 3 per cent reduced MR CLARKSON for the prisoner Q What is the amount of the general proceeds of the personal estate A I am not certain I believe about 14 000l - I am not aware that I have received more than 14 000l - I could have ascertained that if I had thought the question would be asked - I cannot say whether I have - I will not undertake to affirm whether I have not - there was a certain sum detained until the decision of the Court of Chancery was given - Mr Collier was entitled to it by a decree of the court - it was somewhere under £3000 - I cannot tell you how much - I really cannot tell you whether I had received nearly £14 000 under the estate before I received the £3000 from the Chancery Court without having my documents before me - I cannot tell within £1000 what I have received - whatever sum it was there is no doubt whateverthat it was included in the sum under which I proved the will - it was not known at that time that there was any dispute the sum was calculated with the rest - it was not in the Court of Chancery at that time - this sum of £3000 was certainly taken into the account on which the probate duty was calculated MR ADOLPHUS Q The £1600 was invested in the 3 per cents A Yes in the names of the prisoner and myself - here is the regular stock receipt for the money purchased - it is 2044l 3s 1d - the prisoner was joint trustee with me - he was entitled on behalf of his wife during her life to receive the interest of £2044 - I never received a single dividend whatever - George and Henry Wheeler were the brokers who acted for me in the purchase of the stock - I never in any manner either directly or indirectly assisted in or consented to the transfer of that sum of money FRANCIS HENDERSON I am a clerk in the 3 per cent reduced office at the Bank - I have the transfer-book letter D - it is the original book - persons transferring stock sign their names in this book - here is the transfer of £2044 in the names of Collier and Squire MR RICHARD SQUIRE re-examined The name of Richard Squire in this book is not my handwriting - I knew nothing of it till it was shown to me some time after - the signature William Collier I believe to be the prisoner s handwriting - I have seen him write and have had several opportunities of judging of his writing - I was acquainted with him - he knew my person well COURT to FRANCIS HENDERSON Q How comes the transfer in the book D A We cannot always keep to the letter the transfers are so numerous MR SQUIRE cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Is the prisoner s father alive A I don t know I am not acquainted with his family sufficiently - I don t know his name - I know one of the sons at least I have seen him once or twice - his name is William - I never knew him by any other name and by his being called Junior I apprehended he had no other name Q You had some legal misunderstanding with the prisoner I believe yourself A Very little not myself not as I was concerned but it was my duty as the executor to retain certain monies until the Court of Chancery determined - he wanted the money but I took counsel s opinion and could not give it up - I have seen his wife two or three times - I have never inquired of her whether she consented to the transfer - I have had no conversation with her - I believe by the will one trustee is not responsible for the neglect or loss of the other - I have sustained no loss that I know of - I have made no inquiry at all - this is not my prosecution - I believe it is at the instance of the bank - I believe the wife is alive - no call has been made on me by the wife The will was here put in and read Among other legacies it bequeathed to the executors in trust for Sarah Collier the prisoner s wife free from the control of her husband the sum of £1600 to invest in the public funds in their names &c and bequeathed to the prisoner William Collier the residue of the estate - it was dated 14th of June 1813 There was a codicil annexed bequeathing £100 to William Collier the prisoner s son MR CLARKSON to MR SQUIRE Q The sum of £100 was given to the prisoner s son William A Yes - that was paid I think in 1832 when he became of age at least it was invested at that time the other sums were invested and when he became of age it was paid to him with interest - it was in July 1832 - the amount was about £140 JOHN RUMSEY I am a solicitor and live at High Wycombe Bucks I know the prisoner very well - I communicated with him in 1826 on the subject of borrowing some money - the prisoner was to borrow it - I effected the loan to him - Mr John Lane lent it to him - I have the security here with me - I am one of the witnesses to it - it is signed by W Collier Sarah Collier and John Lane - I saw all three names signed - the money was advanced on that security - the prisoner is the William Collier who signed it Cross-examined by MR LUMLEY Q What was the amount of the sum A £200 This instrument was put in and read - it was an assignment executed by William and Sarah Collier to John Lane of the dividends on the £2044 stock as security for the payment of the sum of £200 lent which was to be paid on the 2nd of February 1827 - it was dated the 2nd of August 1826 MR BULLOCK Q Do you know whether that money has been repaid or not A I know it has not - Mr Lane who lent the money is not now living - I have the probate of his will - his executor is Joseph Lane - he is alive - I know the prisoner s wife - I saw her last September - the prisoner lived at Stokenchurch in Oxfordshire - I don t know when he left there - I saw him at the end of September in London - I met him accidentally - I was getting out of the coach and he got off the coach and just at that moment he said he was going to settle at Liverpool MR LUMLEY Q He knew you very well A Yes - the interest on the mortgage was paid regularly - I know the principal has not been paid from having seen the executor of Mr Lane - I saw him last about three weeks ago - I don t know what family the prisoner has - he has several children - I think they are all young -

he came and said he wished to have £120 Consols bought for him - I took his instructions - he gave his name William Collier of Stokenchurch Oxfordshire - I bought it for him - he gave me the money and I gave him the stock receipt -

Blackburn accompanied him to the bank to get the transfer made WILLIAM BLACKBURN I am clerk to Mr Durrant - I know the prisoner - I remember his coming to the office on the 10th of January to get some stock transferred - there was another person with him and I was ordered to attend the bank with Mr Collier to make the transfer - some person directed me to attend him and I did - I knew Mr Collier but not the other party -

he passed for Mr Squire in Mr Collier s presence - I saw Mr Collier at our office afterwards in October when he came to sell £120 consols - he gave instructions for a power of attorney at the same time - looking at it - this is it - it is in my handwriting - I took the instructions from Mr Collier to make the power of attorney - after taking the instructions we leave them at the bank - I took these instructions as he gave them to me read J R Durrant A letter of attorney 3 per cent consols for William Collier Jun of Stokenchurch Gent all to John R Durrant for the purpose of sale and dividends of £1844 3s 1d 1st Oct 1833 WILLIAM BLACKBURN in continuation I procured the power of attorney - this is it - I remember this power of attorney coming in a letter - this letter formed the other half-sheet of the power - it has been detached since the stock was subsequently transferred Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did you attend the transfer yourself A No - I know it was done by our books - the instructions are dated 1st of October - the Stock was 3 per cent reduced - the books were closed then for a dividend and they could not be transferred without the power of attorney Q The original transfer says Witness my hand William Collier - did you see it so written before the name was signed A I did not notice that - the prisoner was present at the time - the other person signed the name of Richard Squire - it is a public office - there might be other persons about SIR J SCARLETT Q Did you send any bank post bills addressed to Mr Collier A I did looking at three - these are them - I sent them to the prisoner Collier - these are the same bills - I addressed them to William Collier Esq No 2 Trueman-street Liverpool - I have seen him write and I believe the endorsement on the bills to be his - I sent them to him in consequence of a letter which I received - this is the letter - I know the bank post bills because they correspond - I recollect I did not take the numbers of them but the names and amounts correspond JOHN HENRY CLARK I am in the employ of Messrs Wheeler stock-brokers - I know Collier - Messrs Wheeler have transacted business for him at various times - he is well known in our office Q On the 30th of April 1833 do you recollect his giving you any instructions A I cannot call to mind his coming to the office looking at a paper - the top of this is my writing - the bottom is Mr Henry Wheeler s writing - I wrote William Collier jun Stokenchurch - the instructions for the sale are in my handwriting - I cannot call to mind who gave the instructions - the sale of £200 was effected - I went to assist at the transfer - I cannot call to mind who went with me F HENDERSON re-examined Here is the transfer of £200 on the 30th of April from William Collier of Stokenchurch Oxfordshire Gent - it says £200 of my which shows it was part of a larger stock - that is part of the £2044 3s 1d - I was present where it was signed - it is signed William Collier jun JOHN HENRY CLARK re-examined I was present when it was signed - I cannot call to mind the individual who was with me - I believe this writing to be the handwriting of William Collier the prisoner at the bar Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Have you seen the son write A Yes I will not undertake to say it is not the son s handwriting but I believe it is the prisoner s - the prisoner writes very different at times - he and his son do not write very much alike - I believe it to be the prisoner s writing SIR JAMES SCARLETT Q Do you believe it to be the son s A No I believe it to be the prisoner s MR CLARKSON Q You say they sometimes write alike A No I do not - there may be some similarity The transfer of the sum of £200 was here put in and read FRANCIS HENDERSON re-examined This is part of the original sum of 2044l 3s 1d - I say so because I have examined the account - I do not find any other sum in the name of William Collier jun except the 2044l 3s 1d JOHN ROWLAND DURRANT I know the prisoner - I have no recollection of his coming to instruct us to purchase this stock - it appears so by my books - the stock was afterwards sold - I have no recollection of having instructions for a power of attorney - my clerk went to get the power of attorney - I recollect transferring the stock by virtue of the power - I recollect before that seeing the prisoner and conversing with him about the power - I recollect he asked me to act on a power of attorney for the sale of £1800 odd stock - I asked him if he had not better bring his son to town to make the transfer as it was but forty miles from town the expense of coach hire would not be more thanthe power of attorney - he said it would be inconvenient for his son to come at the time the stocks opened - they were shut at the time - he said he would be at some distance at that time - he said his son should come to town and execute the power the next day or the day following and the prisoner came the next day or the day following and expressed his surprise that his son had not arrived - he said he must have missed the coach he supposed or there must be some accident - the power was then in our office ready for execution - I think I was called away during the conversation but I understood from my clerk that he had taken the power away - I afterwards received it back with this letter written on the fly-sheet of it - I then acted on the power and caused the stock to be transferred - this is my signature on the back by which I demand to act - my clerk obtained the bank post bills as a matter of course - I received this letter directing me what to do with the proceeds of the sale - I have no doubt the bank post bills were sent to the prisoner in consequence of this letter JAMES HALL FARMER I live in Abchurch-lane - I know the prisoner and his son - the son lives at Stokenchurch - I am not exactly acquainted with his business - I believe he is a schoolmaster - the prisoner once lived at Stokenchurch - he changed his residence I think about the middle of October 1833 and went to Liverpool -

it was on the first of October - it is now dated the 5th - I don t know who did that - the prisoner came first to my counting-house - he said he expected his son up - he waited there an hour or an hour and a half and when the son came the prisoner brought in this paper and it was executed in the counting-house - I saw the son sign it and I witnessed it - the prisoner took it away with him - they both remained in town that day - they dined and slept at my house Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Are you sure this was not on the 5th of October A I am - the instrument is now in the same state I believe as far as I have looked at it - I knew Mr Collier was going to reside at Liverpool some weeks previously - he was going into partnership there - I know the handwriting of the son looking at the letter at the back of the power of attorney - I should say this is the handwriting of the son SIR J SCARLETT Q And so is this is not it A I think it is - the son is alive and I believe is in court - he was here this morning - I have known Mr Collier twelve or thirteen years - he bore the most unblemished reputation as to honesty and good conduct - it was well known he was going to Liverpool The letters were here read as follows Mr Durrant 5th Oct 1833 Sir - I send the power of attorney and shall be obliged to you to make the transfer as soon as possible and send the amount after deducting the expenses in two bank post bills of seven days date Yours &c WILLIAM COLLIER JUN Mr Durrant Stokenchurch Oct 8th 1833 Sir -

Mr James Barnett is the senior partner - there are other partners - in October last we had a customer named Richard Howell a linen-draper who lives in Gracechurch-street - on the 31st of October I was in attendance at the counter and a cheque purporting to be drawn by Mr Howell was presented - this is the cheque - this hole in it was made when it was cancelled - we stamp all our paid cheques in this way - the word pay has been struck out by the instrument - the cheque is not on an engraved form - it appeared strange and I hesitated about paying it and passed it on to Mr George Henry Barnett not liking to rely on my own judgment and he made no hesitation in paying it - the signature resembles the signature of Howell - it is rather a strong resemblance - I have the book in which the notes paid for it are entered by Mr Barnett - I paid £6 7s in cash and Mr Barnett paid the £40 in notes - I noticed the person who presented the cheque having my suspicions - it was a person of the prisoner s age and very much resembling him but I decline swearing to his person - it was between two and three o clock in the afternoon as near as I can guess - he was about five minutes in the house -

I said it was where I was going to reside but I was going to take the machine in a cab to Vauxhall Witness He said he was either going to open a shop in Maddox-street or that he lived in Maddox-street - I asked him for his address and he gave me No 18 Maddox-street - I believe he said he had bought a cart and horse or something to that purpose - I am sure he gave me that direction in answer to my asking his address - he said The name of Johnson No 18 Maddox-street Regent-street - I understood him to mean he was then living there MR ADOLPHUS Q Did he say a word about Vauxhall or the neighbourhood A Not at all - the invoice was dated the 31st of October - I have no reason to think that was not the date - only I have no date in my book - I thought that was the date at the time I wrote it and he said nothing to me about it being the 1st of November ANN NORVAL I am the sister of Mr Norval who keeps the Golden Lion Smithfield - I know Mr Burchfield - I remember receiving a £10 note from him - I do not remember the day of the month - I put no mark on the note myself - I put the note into the cash-box which nobody had access to besides me and my brother - there was no other £10 note in the box I looked to ascertain that - it was within two months of this time within three months certainly - I received no other £10 note from Mr Burchfield before my brother paid it away - I have not received another from him for the last three months THOMAS NORVAL I keep the Golden Lion Smithfield - I remember getting into my cash-box a £10 note - I think it was on Saturday the 2nd of November that my sister received it - I did not see it until the 6th or 7th - there was no other £10 note in the box - I keep one key of the box and my sister keeps the other - I had not taken any other £10 note out - I paid the note to Mr Wills on the 6th or 7th of November ISAAC WILLS I keep the Duke of York public-house Temple-bar - this note has my handwriting on it - I know I received it from Thomas Norval on the 7th of November- I wrote his name and my own on the back of it as soon as I got home - it is No 4295 £10 dated September 18th 1833 - I only received one note from him - I received no other from him - I know this to be the note because I put my name and his on the back of it when I returned home THOMAS NORVAL re-examined I know what was in my cash-box between the 1st of November and the 7th - I went to it occasionally - there was only that one £10 note in it CHARLOTTE EMERY I live at No 18 Maddox-street Regent-street - I do not let out any part of my house - I do not know the prisoner - he never took apartments or a shop of me at any time - I keep the house CHARLES DODDEMEADE I am a tailor and live at No 16 Newington-causeway - I cannot exactly swear to the prisoner but I think he is the person who came to my shop and purchased a suit of clothes for a youth on the 9th of November - they came to 2l 10s - he paid me a £10 note and I gave him the change - I marked the note looking at one - this is it - it is No 4294 dated the 18th September 1833 - he gave me the name of Johnson Bolingbroke-row Walworth - looking at a suit of green clothes produced by Forrester - this is the suit I sold for that £10 note EDWARD WINKWORTH I am shopman to Mr Jones grocer and tea-dealer Walworth - I saw the prisoner at Mr Jones s shop between two and three months ago - he changed a £5 note with us - I did not write on it but Mr Jones did in my presence - the prisoner gave the name of Jones No 11 Canterbury-place Walworth and he got the change - he bought some tea and sugar COURT Q Are you able to swear it was the prisoner A I have not a doubt about him - I was present the whole time and recollect his person - he had a surtout coat and drab trousers Prisoner Q What quantity of sugar and tea was bought A One lb of black 1lb of green and I believe 6lbs of lump sugar - I am certain you gave the name of Jones and not Johnson - I noticed it because master s name is Jones and I noticed you gave the same name - I cannot swear to the colour of your coat because it was by gas light but it was a dark coat WILLIAM JONES I am a grocer and keep the shop in which Winkworth serves - my handwriting is on this £5 note - I have written Mr Jones 11 Canterbury-place which is the name the person gave me - I don t remember his person distinctly - I don t recollect the circumstance of changing the note but I have not a doubt the person changing it gave me that name - it must have been the name he gave - I don t recollect the fact of his changing the note but it must have been the name given to me - the note is No 20 891 dated the 12th of September 1833 EDWIN EVAN LEECH I live at No 11 Canterbury-place Lambeth and have lived there a number of years - in October last the prisoner did not live there - I had no lodgers - I do not know him SAMUEL BELCHER I am a hatter and live at No 4 Borough - the prisoner purchased two hats of me on the 9th of November - one was a silk hat and the other a hat for a lad looking at two hats - these are them - they are in boxes in which they went out of my shop - he paid me by this £5 note looking at it - my handwriting is on it made at the time - I have written William Cooper 9 Queen s-row Walworth which was the address he gave me andhe has been to my shop before and given the same address- I gave him the change - he took away the hats - the note is No 20 894 dated the 12th of September 1833 Prisoner Q How many hats did I buy when I paid the £5 note A Two it might be three - I have dealt with him before and he had then given me that address and when he paid me the £5 note I asked his address - he said Oh you must recollect me I have been here before I live at No 5 Queen s-row Walworth which I then recollected was the last address he gave me and I put that address down Prisoner He never sent hats to my house nor did I give him that address - I and the boy put the hats on and left our old ones to be put in order on the former occasion Witness I don t recollect that - I think I put the address on the box of the first hat he bought DANIEL FORRESTER I am an officer of the City In December last I went to No 6 Vauxhall-walk to look for the prisoner - a boy answered the door - I asked him if his father was up supposing him to be the prisoner s son - he closed the door upon me I being inside and said he was not at home - I think it was about twenty minutes after eight in the morning - another lad came into the passage at the same time - I laid hold of them both - they made a sort of noise - I then opened the front door having two or three other persons with me to let them in - I let go of the boys opened the front door and one of the lads ran up stairs - I followed him up directly afterwards and some person was in the act of pushing the back room door to - I put my foot to it and forced it open - as I went into the room I observed a door in the left hand corner just closed to - it was a very small door - if I had not seen it close I should have thought it was a cupboard-door - there was a woman in the room who the prisoner said was his wife - I called out to my companions to look out behind thinking somebody had gone through the door - I afterwards found the door led to a little room which room led down into a washhouse by a pair of steps into the back yard - when I called out Look out behind the woman said He is not here - but in about a minute the prisoner came into the room from the little door with only his shirt on - I said What is your name he said Johnson - I said Is that woman your wife he said Yes - I asked her where she got the £5 note she had changed with Mr Burlton the pawnbroker in the Walworth-road on the 2nd of November - the prisoner answered From a person of the name of Hadley - at the same moment the woman said He is a gambler - I then left him in the room and went and brought out two hat boxes and a blue suit of clothes - the hats were in the boxes and I found a green suit of clothes in the room below - I found this paper in a front parlour in the table-drawer - it is the bill for the machine - I then asked him where he got the £5 note he had passed with Mr Belcher for the two hats - I had not told him what he was charged with and did not give him any caution that he need not answer - I was instructed to trace the notes and had asked other people about them before and if his answer was satisfactory I should have traced them to other persons - he said he had taken that note of the same person I found a boy s green suit of clothes and I asked him where he got the £10 note he passed at Mr Doddemead s on the 9th of November COURT Q Are you not aware it is not usual to question a person charged with felony without cautioning him that he need not answer A My Lord I had no direct proof he was the man - I wanted to trace the notes - he told me he had taken it of the same person - he said he himself dealt in unredeemed pledges and that he had sold him guns and watches to the amount of £50 or £60 - I won t be sure which - he said Hadley lived in Kennington-lane - I have since inquired diligently for such a person in Kennington-lane but could hear of no such person - I went to a great many public-houses and bakers -shops and to the tax-gatherer and could find no such person Prisoner When Mr Forrester entered the room my wife was in bed and I with her - she was very poorly overnight and our infant child was with us - the only obstruction the boy made was from the indecent manner in which Forrester and three other officers entered the room and would not go out while she put on her clothes D FORRESTER She was not in bed when I entered - she was in her chemise - I believe she asked us to withdraw from the room - she was the nearest person I found to the door when I entered - I had felt somebody pushing the door Prisoner They having entered the room at that hour without producing any authority I made to the little room to know where the robbers were coming in Witness It was on a Sunday morning about twenty minutes after eight o clock - I was requested to withdraw while his wife dressed but there were only two of us in the room at the time Prisoner There were no steps to go down from the little room Witness There were steps leading down stairs from the little room - I went up the next day without moving them - they stood under a sort of trap-door leading into this little room Prisoner When Mr Forrester asked me where I got the notes I made no hesitation in saying I took them from Hadley - I was then taken away by two officers to a public-house at the corner of Vauxhall-bridge and from there was driven about to two or three tradesmen the hatter and tailor and then we were driven to the Mansion-house without their stating the charge or showing me any authority with my wife and child and my wife and child were locked up all the night in the Compter Witness The child was locked up with you at your own request your wife had changed one of the notes MR BODKIN Q You had no directions to apprehend him but was employed in tracing the notes through the different hands of the persons who had possessed them A Yes COURT Q Did not you go there with a full intention of bringing him away in custody if you found him A Yes and I put the questions to him with a view of using them against him afterwards JOSEPH WEAVER I am in the employ of Mr Burlton pawnbroker of Bedford-row Walworth - I know the prisoner s wife - she paid me this £5 note on Saturday the 2nd of November - the prisoner was not present - it is No 20 893 dated the 12th of September 1833 HENRY HUDSON I am a coffee-house-keeper and live in Charles-street Covent Garden - I have known the prisoner ten or twelve years - his name is John Coveney - I knew him keeping a tavern in London by that name and I knew his family it is the name they all go by - I have seen him write looking at the cheque - it is ten years since I saw him write - he used to write some such hand as that - I cannot safely form a belief whose handwriting it is - if I was asked if I thought it like his handwriting I should say yes but I cannot swear it - I think the letters like it - I think it such a kind of hand as he used to write - I have a faint belief that it is like his handwriting Q Do you believe it to be his handwriting or not A I should think it is not his handwriting then - I cannot say it is his COURT Q You think it is not A I think it is not ROBERT YORSTON I am a law stationer and live in Chancery-lane - I have known the prisoner about nineteen years - his name is John Coveney - I have not seen him write these nine or ten years - before that I have seen him write a great deal - I have seen the cheque the words Barnett and London have a strong resemblance to his handwriting - if the cheque was put into my hand unaccompanied by any observation it would not strike me as his writing - looking at it apart from this transaction I should not have formed a belief that it was his but my attention has been drawn to it and I have looked at it particularly - I trace his character of handwriting about it - it is evidently a disguised hand COURT Q You were well acquainted with his writing nine or ten years ago A Yes I have letters of his by me which he wrote then - my memory has been refreshed by having letters of his before me within the last three days - I trace his character of handwriting - I cannot swear it is his - I should say the words Barnett and London are much like it Q If you took the paper up and was asked whose it was without this circumstance being known should you have said it was his A Perhaps I should - I don t think the signature is his handwriting taking it altogether I am more inclined to believe it is his handwriting than that it is not from the character of handwriting - handwriting varies - sometimes persons writing in the same room from practice will write the same character but we in the trade know how to distinguish them The cheque was here put in and read Prisoner s Defence written I reside at No 6 Vauxhall-walk Lambeth - I am a decorative painter by trade and also a purchaser of pawnbrokers tickets or duplicates and unredeemed pledges On Thursday the 31st of October last I sold to a person by the name of William Hadley the under-mentioned articles -

William Hadley third mate H C S Marquis of Camden or Hastings I cannot say which the card being either mislaid or destroyed by my little daughter Hadley sent my son for a coach and put the goods in and drove off towards the City On that day my son and myself were at Battersea and Chelsea from ten in the morning till we arrived home at five o clock where Hadley was waiting to see me he appeared in a great hurry and I produced the articles he wished he looked them over and made the purchase On that evening I went with my two sons to Walworth about a house I was then taking I was there till nine o clock and then returned home after making a few purchases and did not go out again The next evening Friday the 1st of November being then about to place my son in the fish trade we proceeded to Smithfield to a Mr Burchfield a scale-maker to whom I was recommended and purchased a weighing machine fish-knives weights &c I tendered him for payment a £10 note he gave me the change but sent the note out for that purpose he gave me a bill of parcels and dated it the 31st of October I made a remark immediately and said You have made a mistake of a day this is the 1st of November but I said it was of no consequence and put the bill in my pocket-book he found his mistake we took the goods with us - my son being with me at the time of the purchase I gave my wife 20l to pay bills and make purchases About two years or more nearly three years ago I purchased a great number of tickets of a person by name Cooper which pledges were principally at Mr Burlton s My wife was known by the name of Cooper it was for no felonious intent that the names were given on the notes but only by the address that Hadley gave me It was not likely I should give or pay notes away in a neighbourhood where I was so well known having removed from there only a few months ago and was on the point of going back again DANIEL FORRESTER re-examined Q Where did you apprehend the prisoner A At No 6 Vauxhall-walk Lambeth - I think it is in Surrey - he was committed from the Mansion-house to Newgate for the City of London - he was in custody at the Mansion-house - I did not see him in custody at Newgate MR WILLIAM WADHAM COPE Governor of Newgate The prisoner was committed from the Mansion-house as a London prisoner MR BARNETT Our banking-house is in the parish of St Edmund the King and Martyr MR HUDSON Up to the time I knew the prisoner which was ten years ago he bore a good character - I had known him many years before JURY to RICHARD HOWELL Q Are you in the habit of writing cheques in this manner A No I write on printed cheques only - I certainly have allowed other persons to fill up my cheques for me - I never sent a plain cheque - I occasionally allow persons to fill up cheques- they were always printed and always signed by myself JURY to GEORGE SEWELL Q On the cheque beingpresented did you take sufficient notice to identify the prisoner A I looked at the cheque having a doubt of it and then looked attentively at the man who appeared to me a sort of tradesman - I thought him incapable of forging a cheque and handed it to Mr Barnett - I decline to swear to the prisoner - I have no doubt at all of his being the person - I believe him to be the man - I am satisfied of it myself but decline to swear it GUILTY of uttering only Aged 53 -

this was at my house at Hammersmith - I said certainly I would - he produced the cheque - I looked at it and saw it was drawn in favour of Mr Temple - I said I do not know Mr Harrison but as I know Mr Temple I will give you the money -

LEE conducted the prosecution THOMAS OLIVER I am clerk to Henry Drummond and others looking at a letter On Thursday the 9th of October I received this letter the course of business—it is a part of my duty to open letters of business addressed to the firm—I did so on this occasion and found this letter contained the bill of exchange I now hold in my hand—Lord Stradbroke kept an account at our house at that time—I was familiar with his handwriting—this letter looking at one was sent by order of the house—after reading the bill and letter I handed it over to Mr Rush Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Has Mr Drummond any other name than Henry A No—I am well acquainted with Lord Stradbroke s writing—the signature to the bill does not in the least resemble his writing DANIEL FORRESTER I am a City

her—she pointed to the letter and said That is my handwriting —the face of the draft was towards her—she pointed to me to turn it which I did and she said That is my handwriting alluding to the indorsement I think I have gone rather too fast—as soon as I got her into the back room I said You are not bound to answer me any questions unless you please it will either be used for or against you —that was before I asked her a question Q On your producing the letter and bill did she state what you have said without your asking her the question A Yes she said it was her handwriting—I held the bill in my hand—she pointed to the indorsement C Hillier and said it was her handwriting—when she said that is my handwriting she referred to the C Hillier on the back—she said I can only speak the truth —I then told her I understood the signature purporting to be Lord Stradbroke s was a forgery—she said the had taken it of an agent in France and that Lord Stradbroke was not personally known to her—I asked her in what part of France—she said Nantz —I asked her the name of the agent—she said Percy —I asked her when she took it—she said On the 16th of this month —I said The 16th of this month has not arrived yet and she said It was the 16th of last month —I said September she said Yes the 16th I left on the 18th —the said I took it in a money transaction for some pictures or in a picture transaction —I do not recollect which she said—after this I went with her to Augusta-place into two rooms there—she brought away a carpet bag a trunk and basket containing wearing apparel and other things—I kept the trunk and she had the key in her possession—there was a purse in her trunk but nothing important—I found this piece of blotting-paper in the trunk of which I took possession and which she kept the key of—in consequence of a mark on the paper of the first letter I went to Mr Thomas a stationer at Weymouth and made inquiry there—I found some paper corresponding with that in the trunk—there was some marked Thomas Weymouth —here is the whole of the paper found in the trunk—it bears the same impression in the corner as the paper—the letter is written on Thomas Weymouth —it was in the same trunk Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You have put your inittials on each sheet A I did so—I made a memorandum of my conversation with her shortly after and have it here producing it —I have not made my statement of the conversation independent of that memorandum—I certainly have looked at it since—I made the memorandum in order that I might be more accurate—I cannot say now whether I made it on the Sunday or Monday—the conversation passed on the Friday—I have not seen Norton a confectioner here—I did not ask whether more persons lodged in Augusta-place besides the prisoner—there might have been and I should think there were—I saw persons in a room up stairs ESAU VIVIAN I am a clerk in the banking-house of Messrs Williams of Weymouth On the morning of Friday the 10th of October about one o clock or half-past one I saw the prisoner there—she said she had a letter from Messrs Drummond the bankers and inquired if we had received any instructions to pay her some money—I do not know whether she produced a letter to me—this letter No 2 was produced to me in the course of the morning before she left the office—on her making the inquiry I said we had received instructions respecting the payment of some money—I inquired if she was furnished with a receipt for the amount—I do not recollect whether she stated the amount—she said No she was not furnished with one—I said it was necessary she should write a receipt which must be on a stamp—she said Perhaps I had better get a stamp then and bring a receipt and immediately inquired whether we kept stamps—I produced this stamp looking at one and she filled it up—this is what she wrote on that occasion—in consequence of something I said while she was writing the receipt Forrester was introduced into the office—immediately she began to write I had him brought in Cross-examined Q Do you know whether Lord Stradbroke if in the habit of purchasing pictures abroad A I do not WILLIAM THOMAS I am a stationer living at Weymouth and a subdistributor of stamps In October last I saw the prisoner several times five or six days—on Tuesday the 7th of October I sold her a 6s bill stamp with some writing paper and blotting paper looking at the letter and some sheets of paper —I have every reason to believe this is the same paper—each sheet bears my stamp but I keep a large stock of it—she had them all at the same time—she first asked for the stamp and then for the paper Cross-examined Q Have you any means of confirming your recollection of the day you sold her the stamp and paper A Yes I have not a book but a cheque list which I keep in my till—I have not got it with me—we do not preserve them—the list would strengthen my memory as to the date and amount of the stamp—my business is very large—I could not tell how many stamps I sold on that day by reference to my book—very likely I told a good many—two days elapsed between the time of selling the stamp and Forrester s coming to me—my memory is perfectly clear as to the transaction WILLIAM RUSH I have compared the figures in the bill with an impression on the blotting paper—I have not the least hesitation in saying that they are the same—I have examined them with a glass—I compared the bill and blotting paper and have not the least hesitation in saying the marks on the blotting paper correspond with the bill—the bill has been dried on the blotting paper—there are more than two partners in our firm THE RIGHT HON JOHN EDWARD CORNWALLIS EARL STRADBROKE In October last I kept a cash account at Messrs Drummond s I am not in the habit of drawing bills of this sort on them Q Is the signature to that bill and the indorsement in your handwriting A They are not nor are they like it—it was not done by my authority or knowleged in any way whatever—I do not know a person named percy—I never had a picture transaction on the Continent Cross-examined Q Have you any knowledge of the prisoner A I never heard of her—I have no knowledge of her whatever The following are the letters read in evidence No 1 — To Messrs Drummond Charing-cross Weymouth 8th October 1834 —Gentlemen I shall feel much obliged by your remitting me the enclosed amount

deliverd in the written defence stating that during the revolution at Brussels in 1830 she had purchased at a reasonable price a quantity of pictures of a gentleman residing there who was hastily leaving the town—that in the summer of last year while at the gallery of the Louvre at Paris taking a sketch she was accosted by a man of gentlemanly manners who stated himself to be collecting pictures for several noblemen mentioning Lord Stradbroke among others—that he finally agreed to purchase the whole she had and ultimately paid her the draft in question—that the following month she came to Weymouth and forwarded the draft to Messrs Drummond s—she declared her innocence of which she contended the open manner she had acted was a proof GUILTY of uttering Aged 46 — Transported for

first of exchange to the order of Mr Thomas Perry in the sum of £54 sterling Messrs Oxenford and Allcock London H L Rehausen with intent to defraud George Henry Barnett and others against the Statute —2nd COUNT for feloniously offering and putting off the said bill with a like intent —3rd and 4th COUNTS for forging and uttering a forged acceptance of the said bill —4 other COUNTS the same only stating his intent to be to defraud William Oxenford and another —8 other COUNTS the same only omitting to set out the forged instrument MR ADOLPHUS conducted the Prosecution RICHARD BESCOBY I am a clerk in the employ of Messrs George Henry Barnett and three more partners On the 30th of October this bill was presented at our counter—Oxenford and Allcock have an account at our house—it was not presented by the prisoner but by another person who wrote on it a receipt in the name of Joseph Boyd—it was paid in gold—I had some doubt about it when presented and showed it to some other cashiers but afterwards I paid it—it was written off Messrs Oxenford s account and put into their pass-book in the regular way WILLIAM OXENFORD I am in partnership with William Blackston Allcock A lady named Rehausen used to do business through our house—she is since dead—the prisoner was a clerk in our house for nine years and kept all our correspondence—he would know that the baroness Rehausen had transactions with us— looking at the bill the acceptance to this bill is neither mine nor my partner s writing—it is an imitation of my handwriting— H L Rehausen is written on it—the Baroness always signed H L but never drew a bill on us—it is not her handwriting—I believe the body of the bill to be the prisoner s handwriting from examining it with his own writing in my possession—my belief is that it is his from my knowledge of other handwriting of his in my possession—I never authorized him to accept bills for us COURT Q Have you ever seen the Baroness Rehausen write A Yes I have had repeated correspondence with her but I never saw her write lately—I have written to her and had answers from her and have acted on those answers—I can form a judgment from the course of that correspondence that those letters were written by her—she drew her dividends from us—she used to authorize a banker to draw on us for them—she never drew a single bill herself—the signature H L Rehausen it written by the same hand as the body of the bill—it is rather like the Baroness s writing but it is not hers JOSEPH BOYD I live at Croydon in Surrey The prisoner lodged in my house for a fortnight—at the end of October he owed me 4l 10s —I required payment of it and he gave me this draft—he told me to go to town and get the money and told me when they gave me the money to sign my name as Thomas Perry—I asked him why he wished me to sign my name so for—he said there would be no harm in it and said if they asked whether I would have gold or notes to bring gold—I went to town and presented the bill at Barnett and Hoare s—I chucked the draft down and they gave me the money—I wrote my own name on it not the name he told me—I took it to Croydon and gave all of it to the prisoner—he took it in doors and paid my mistress 4l 10s which he owed her and he gave me 10s for my trouble of going to town—after that he went out and paid a few debts and took a house for himself next door but one to me—the indorsement on the bill is my handwriting WILLIAM MESSENGER I live at Croydon I cannot write—on Monday the prisoner asked me to go to town to cash a bill of exchange—he did not give it to me—he asked me to go to London to fetch his money and he would give me 5s —I said I would go and on Wednesday night he said he thought it would not do for me to go because I could not write and Mr Boyd would go Bill read Prisoner s Defence written As the evidence of my case is so clear against me I have nothing to say in my defence but throw myself on the mercy of the Court praying that your Lordship will show me as much lenity as can be after I state the following dreadful situation I am placed in —that I have a wife entirely depending on my support and she will be thrown utterly destitute on the world if I should be banished from this country—that I have been afflicted with bad legs for upwards of three years and from the time of my committal I have been under the surgeon s hands at the infirmary at the gaol scarcely able to stand upon them the pain being so acute and I fear that if my punishment is too severe it will be the occasion of my losing them—that I committed the crime through actual want and distress which was occasioned through my bad health but if your Lordship should be pleased to sentence me to some lighter punishment than perhaps I ought to expect I will in my future life conduct myself with the utmost honesty let my misery and privations be the utmost that can be endured by a human being This is the first time I ever was charged with crime of any description GUILTY of uttering Aged 24 — Transported for Life Second Jury before Mr Recorder

be to defraud Sir Coutts Trotter Bart and others WILLIAM TAYLER I keep the Feathers public-house in Grosvenor-place About the latter end of October or the 1st of November the prisoner came to my house and on coming to the bar he said How do you do Mr Tayler —I looked in his face and thought I had some recollection of his features—I invited him into the bar he then presented me a paper and said Will you do this for Mr Dundas —I looked at it it was a cheque drawn on Coutts and Co saying Pay to John Saunders or bearer 20l 16s —it purported to be drawn by R Dundas—I know a gentleman of the name of Dundas in the neighbourhood at No 97 Eaton-square—I invited the prisoner to take a seat in my bar saying I had not the change myself but I would go and get it—I went to Mr Duhan a grocer in Eaton-street who cashed it for me—I returned and gave the money to the prisoner who went away—the cheque was brought back to me on the Friday following by Mr Duhan—I learnt from him that it was refused payment—I gave him the cash for it again and received the cheque from him and have it here—it is the same cheque—I sent my servant to Mr Dundas s house and found he was not in town—I wrote a letter to him and received an answer—I saw Mr Dundas two or three days afterwards at my house—the prisoner was brought to my house by a gentleman named Penhall about two months afterwards—I said to him How could you think of coming and imposing on me and robbing me in the manner you have done of 20l 16s —can you make any arrangement with me he said I cannot I have nothing to offer —he then began to state that he was out of a situation and some conversation which I did not pay attention to—I called in a policeman and gave him in charge—when he asked me if I could do it for Mr Dundas he did not state Mr Dundas s place of abode—I have done business with Mr Dundas of Eaton-square which led me to suppose he meant that Mr Dundas and it was on that I acted—I have some knowledge of the prisoner s features but on what occasion I ever saw him before I cannot recollect HENRY JAMES PITT I am a policeman The prisoner was given into my custody on Tuesday evening the 30th of December by Mr Tayler at the Feathers public-house—I asked him if he was aware of the nature of the charge—he said yes that he had come down with Mr Penhall to satisfy Mr Tayler CHARLES DUHAN I live in Eaton-street On the 1st of November Mr Tayler brought me a cheque for 20l 16s to be cashed—I advanced the money to him—I paid it away to my wholesale butter-merchant on the Tuesday following—his name is Hall of the firm of Simpson and Hall in Oxford-street—he wrote his banker s name on the face of it and sent it in to his banker s Cox and Co of Charing-cross and two days afterwards he and I went together to Cox and Co s—the cheque was returned to Mr Hall in my presence by one of the clerks and he gave a cheque of his own for it—the cheque in question was delivered to him—this is the cheque looking at it —I saw the witness write his banker s name across and saw him receive it back from them WILLIAM TAYLER re-examined This is the cheque I received from the prisoner and which I paid to Mr Duhan WILLIAM HALL I live in Oxford-street This is the cheque I received from Mr Duhan—I put my banker s name across it which is here now—I paid it into my banker s Cox and Co on the following morning the 5th of November—on Friday the 7th I received it from them again as being dishonoured—I gave my own cheque for it—I returned the cheque to Mr Duhan who returned it to Mr Tayler MR DUHAN re-examined After the cheque was returned to Mr Hall he returned it to me—I returned it to Tayler—this is the same WILLIAM TULLY I am clerk to Messrs Cox and Biddulph who are bankers at Charing-cross I received this cheque on account of Mr Simpson with other money—it was presented at Coutts and Co s but not by me—the clerk is not here who did—it was sent there on the 6th and came back dishonoured ROBERT HARE I am clerk to Messrs Coutts This cheque was presented at our house on the 6th of November and dishonoured the drawer having no effects or account with our house—we have a customer named Robert Dundas who draws on us on his own account—this is not his signature—Robert Andrew Dundas of Eaton-square draws by virtue of a letter of credit from the bank of Scotland—it is not his handwriting nor the handwriting of any body who keeps cash with us nor any body who has any right to draw on us JOHN PENHALL On the 30th of December the prisoner went with me to Mr Tayler s—I asked him if he was only the utterer of the cheque or whether he was the forger as well—my motive was to screen him as I thought if he was only the utterer not knowing the law—I thought the guilt not so much if he would give up the forger—I had no authority to put any questions to him—I told him he stood in a very dangerous situation if the forgery against him could be proved—I attempted to point out the difference between the forger and the utterer supposing another person had forged it and given it to him to pass—the only reply he made to me was I shall abide by the consequences —I did not press the matter farther—I did not say it would be better for him to tell me about it Prisoner s Defence I am not the forger of the draft—I leave myself entirely to your Lordship s mercy—I was not in the least aware at the time that it was a

omitting to set out the forged instrument MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution SAMUEL COLEMAN I am porter at the New Hummums Covent-gardon On Friday the find of January the prisoner came into the hall at the Hummums a few minutes before three o clock—he had a green shade over his eyes and a cloak on which resembled this one—he inquired for Major James—I said I did not know Major James—he said he was going to dine there—I said I did not know him but very possibly he might be coming to dime there—he then said I want a porter to walk with me a little way I have something for him to do —I went out with him—we went down Tavistock-row and down Bedford-street—when we got to the bottom the prisoner went into Mr Webb s shop at the corner of the Strand and Bedford-street and he desired me to wait outside—he came out again with a letter in his hand and crossed over to the other corner of Bedford-street—he held the letter up and directed me to go with it—he said Take this to No 16 St James s-street and wait an answer and I shall be at the Hummums —this is the same letter I have every reason to believe — looking at it —I went to No 16 St James-street—I found it to be the Banking-house of Herries Farquhar and Co —I went in and gave the letter to Mr Hance one of the clerks—I was taken into a back parlour where some gentlemen sat—they asked me from whom I brought the letter and I told them I brought it from a gentleman but I did not know his name—there was some conversation between them but I cannot tell what and I was allowed to come out—when I came out I saw the prisoner looking at me very intently and watching me—he was facing the door in St James-street—I had my hand in my pocket and walked on—the prisoner followed me round into King-street—I noticed him very much and was almost positive he was the man that gave me the letter—I went back and stated my suspicions to the clerks at the banking-house—there was some time elapsed and Mr Hance then came out with me—we went up to St James-square and saw the prisoner on the right hand side of the square nearly facing No 6 on the Pall-Mall side—I tapped him on the shoulder as he was walking gently on—I said I beg your pardon but I believe you are the gentleman who gave me a letter from the Hummums and took me to the bottom of Bedford-street—he said No I think you are mistaken —when I heard his voice I was almost positive he was the man—Mr Hance then came up and spoke to him and asked him to walk back to the banking-house with us—we came back together Mr Hance taking hold of his arm and I walked a little behind just behind the prisoner as close as I could walk—as we were going along Mr Hance said He has thrown something down pick it up —I saw a person walking behind me and he picked up a green shade—he was holding it in his hand—I said I beg your pardon give that to me it belongs to this gentleman —I might have said I beg your pardon I will not be positive—the person gave me the shade—this is it—I do not know whether the prisoner heard what I said about the shade—he might have heard it—I do not know that he did—this shade is very similar to the one the prisoner had over his eyes when he came to the Hummums Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q I thought you said it was about three o clock when the person you call the prisoner came to the Hummums did you observe the clock A I said a little before three o clock it perhaps might want ten minutes—our people were dining at the time and I was in the hall—there is a clock in the hall—I had looked at it—I should think it was about seven minutes before three o clock—I could not say to the moment—the cloak and shade rather concealed the person—the shade concealed his eyes and the cloak concealed his person and dress in some manner—I could see his legs he had boots and trowsers on—I believe his trowsers were blue—he had a hat on—the shade projected a little beyond his hat it being over his face—I could see the bottom portion of his face—I have no doubt I should know the man if I saw him in Yorkshire a year hence—he has a particular voice Q You said before he spoke and after he had spoken that you were almost positive he was the man—I suppose you mean you were not quite positive A When I heard him speak I was quite positive—the person who came to the Hummums seemed lame and leaned on my arm—when we saw the prisoner in St James s-square he was not walking lame—I believe the man is not here who picked up the shade he seemed a working man—I saw him pick it up where it came from I cannot tell—I saw him stooping and picking it up when Mr Hance told me the prisoner had dropped something—I did not inquire who he was—I did not ask his name and address—the prisoner walked slowly from the Hummums to the baker s shop leaning on my arm MR BODKIN Q Do you know any thing of the lameness more than that he appeared to be so A No COURT Q You say he walked slowly A Yes and pressed on my arm—he said he was lame—it was his own observation—at that time he had a cloak and a shade on—he had no stick Prisoner Q When you saw me in the Square did you not say you thought that was the man from his hat and boots A I did not say so there—I have said so MR PHILLIPS Q Where aid you say that A I do not recollect where but I did not say it there—my memory is not bad Prisoner At the station-house when they asked you whether you could not swear to my voice did you not say No the person was so muffled up when he spoke Witness No I have no recollection of it—I will not swear I did not—I might have said it and forgotten it MR BODKIN Q Did you notice the hat and boots of the person A Yes the hat was bent in behind Prisoner This is the hat I had on putting it on Witness I believe it is MR PHILLIPS Q Did not you at the police-office insist upon the hat and cloak and screen being put upon the man A I did not—they were put on him COURT Q Did that increase to diminish your opinion that he was the same man A I was convinced he was when I saw him dressed in the same way as the man was who addressed me at the Hummums—I first remarked that his hat was bent behind when he walked arm in arm with me—I am taller than him and I noticed it and I saw the same bend in the hat when I saw him in St James -square—I cannot say that I made that remark before the magistrate—I might have said it MR PHILLIPS Q Was what you said read over to you A Yes I signed it—I cannot call to mind whether I mentioned about the bend in the hat HENRY HANCE I am clerk in the banking-house of Messrs Herries Farquhar and Co —Sir Thomas Harvie Farquhar is one of the partners and he has more than one partner—Messrs Tattersalls keep cash at our house—on the 2nd of January between three and four o clock I was at the counter—this witness came in and brought this letter—upon opening it I found it confined the draft—I suspected it was not genuine—I asked Coleman in and he was asked some questions—we were satisfied with his account and let him go—in the course of a minute or two he came back and made a communication which induced me to go out and I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of King-street and St James -street with a red pocket-handkerchief in his hand—I went out at our private-door in King-street not the door that Coleman went out at—the prisoner seemed to be watching the door of the banking-house in St James -street—I went round to Coleman—the prisoner had then left the corner and was going in the direction of St James -square—we went in that direction and overtook the prisoner in St James -square—Coleman accosted him and said he was the party who had sent him with a letter to St James-street—the prisoner said Not me Sir —Coleman persisted in it and said he was positive he was the man—I asked the prisoner to return with me and I took hold of his right arm—I asked him if he had no better employ than sending porters to banking-houses—he said I do not know any thing about it it was not me —he then proceeded in the direction of the banking-house and I asked where he had been for the last ten minutes—he said Making a call in King-street at No 10 but the house was shut up —I observed that was a gambling-house—he said it was or Yes —I asked if he knew Mr Chifney—he said he knew two gentlemen of the name of Chifney—he wished to disengage himself from my hold and said there was no occasion for that Prisoner That was in the square—when you took hold of me I said I would walk without your holding me Witness We then proceeded towards the banking-house—Coleman walked with us abreast—the prisoner put his right hand into his breeches pocket and was feeling about—some time after he drew it out and I saw something on the pavement on the spot which we had passed immediately before—I think it was about twelve yards from us—I had not noticed any thing when I had passed that part of the pavement COURT Q Had it so happened that you had passed and repassed the same spot A Yes but that was some minutes previously MR BODKIN Q What did you do A I told Coleman to pick it up—I believe I said He has dropped something pick it up —a person took it up and was in the act of fixing it on the palisades of a house and Coleman took it off—the person gave it up instantly to Coleman who has retained it ever since—I told Coleman the prisoner had dropped something and told him to pick it up in a tone of voice that the prisoner could hear but he said nothing Cross-examined Q Did the prisoner walk very lame A Not at all Sir—when I took him by the arm he told me to let him go he could walk by himself—when I saw him in King-street he was walking up and down but not going from the corner—he spoke to one of the men who were at work doing some repairs at Crockford s which is called St James s Bazaar—that is not No 10—I believe No 10 is a gaming-house—he might have been there before I came out—he walked with me to the banking-house—I asked him if he knew Major James and he said he did not—the officer was sent for—the prisoner s residence was not asked in my hearing till he was at Marlborough-street—he gave it without any reservation and I believe it was correct—I did not attend particularly to where it was HENRY SHERSBY I am in the employ of Mr Webb No 422 Strand at the corner of Bedford-street On the 2nd of January a person came into the shop about three o clock in the afternoon—to the best of my belief it was the prisoner—he had a brown cloak on and a green shade over his eyes—I have no doubt in swearing that this is the cloak—I have seen but one like it in town—my master deals in such articles—I did pot notice the colour of the lining—I cannot say whether this is the shade—when he came into the shop he asked me which was the way to Pall-mall and I told him—he stood in the shop some little time—I did not notice that he had any thing in his hand—when he left our shop I saw him in conversation with Coleman at the other corner of Bedford-street by Mr Ward s the baker—they then separated and the prisoner went into Mr Ward s Cross-examined Q What peculiarity is there in this cloak A It is a peculiar colour a reddish brown—I believe the prisoner to be the man AUGUSTA WARD I am the daughter of Mr Ward a biscuit-baker at the corner of Bedford street On the 2nd of January I was in the shop about three o clock in the afternoon a person came in and asked to leave a cloak—he took it off and laid it on the counter—he said Will you allow me to leave this till I return from Charing-cross —I did not take notice of the person—I cannot tell whether it was the prisoner or not—the policeman afterwards came and had the same cloak about nine o clock in the evening—the gentleman who was to return from Charing-cross never came for it COURT Q Did you remark the size or general appearance of the person A No my Lord I did not take any notice of him but from what little I saw of him I should say the prisoner is the man—he was in the act of taking the cloak off as he came into the shop—I was in the parlour and came into the shop Cross-examined Q I believe you took no particular notice of the person A No ELIZABETH WARD I am sister of the last witness I recollect on the 2nd of January a person coming into my father s shop—I was in the parlour behind but I could see into the shop very plainly—I saw the person taking a cloak off—I should not know him RICHARD TATTERSALL I am proprietor of the Subscription-rooms at the corner of Hyde-park This cheque is not my handwriting and I never authorized any person to write it—I do not keep a private account at Herries —we keep the account of the firm there—I have known the prisoner some years—I should call him a leg—he lives by betting—he was in the habit of frequenting our rooms—I have seen him frequently—I have seen him with a cloak on—I could not say as to the colour of it—I have seen him with a shade over his eyes Cross-examined Q He is a betting man A Yes—I think that is not right but such persons resort to our rooms GEORGE STONE police-constable C 99 On the 2nd of January I went to Mr Ward s shop and received this cloak—the prisoner told me he lived at No 12 Lascelles-place Bloomsbury—I found this pocket-book and paper there GEORGE HOBBS police-constable C 85 I searched the prisoner s lodging at No 18 Lascelles-place and I found some papers which I sealed up The cheque was put in and read RICHARD TATTERSALL re-examined There is a jockey very well known of the name of Chifney On the envelope inclosing the cheque was written St James -street No 16 a cheque please to send it short —the sheets of paper found at the prisoner s lodgings were the same in size and appearance as the one which had inclosed the cheque and had the same water-mark and some slips of paper were found in the pocket-book the same in size and appearance as the one on which the cheque was written Prisoner s Defence I know nothing of the circumstance any more than being on the spot in the square—I seem confounded—I can only say I do not know any thing of it—I have nothing to say particularly MARY TONBRIDGE I live at No 12 Lascelles-place Broad-street Bloomsbury The prisoner lodged with me last month—he certainly was at home on the 2nd of January—I did not see him at all that day myself—my daughter saw him at three o clock that day MR BODKIN Q Have you seen him with a cloak A Yes JURY Q What sort of a cloak was it A I could not tell—I never was very near him when he had it on COURT Q How long have you known him A He lodged with me twelve months last October JANE TONBRIDGE I live at home with my mother The last time I saw the prisoner was on Friday—I do not know about how long ago it—I am eleven years old—it was on a Friday about three o clock—I asked my mother because I had to do something for Mrs Lupton when Mr Lupton was gone out—I asked my mother if he was gone out—she said she did not know and I went up and saw him sitting by the fire—he went out not long afterwards—I cannot tell how long MR BODKIN Q Was this Mr Lupton s cloak A I am sure I do not know—I was not at home when the officer brought this cloak to our house—I did not look at the clock but my mother said it was three Prisoner She went out at half-past two o clock for some beer for me MR PHILLIPS to MARY TONBRIDGE Q What day was it your daughter asked you this question A On the day Mr Lupton was taken into custody—I know the time from my own eight-day clock which stood in the parlour—my daughter went up stairs but Mr Lupton was not gone out MR BODKIN Q What time did Mr Lupton go out A I do not know—he was in the house at three o clock but after that I cannot tell—I should think my house is about ten minutes walk from the Hummums in Covent-garden—the officers came to my house when I was not at home—they came a second time and brought a cloak—they asked if I knew it—I said it was very like Mr Lupton s but I would not swear to it as there were so many alike GUILTY of

t18350302-807  807 THOMAS LITTLE was indicted for that he on the 27th of September at St Catherine Cree Church alias Christ Church having in his custody and possession a certain Bill of Exchange which was as follows £49 13s —London September 27 1834—Four months after date pay to our order 49l 13s value received— Thomas Little and Co to Mr C Stiell Poplar feloniously did forge on the said Bill of Exchange an acceptance of the same which was as follows C Stiell at No 69 Leadenhall-street City with intent to defraud Henry Cooper against the Statute —2nd COUNT for uttering &c a like forged acceptance knowing it to be forged with a like intent —3rd 4th and 5th COUNTS omitting to set out the Bill of Exchange and acceptance MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution HENRY COOPER I am a Black well-hall-factor and live in Cateaton-street In September last or the beginning of October I received from the prisoner some Bills of Exchange among others the bill produced—he asked me to discount them—he was at that time in my debt—in consequence of an arrangement with him afterwards I applied the bills in my hands towards liquidating my own account JOHN WESTWOOD I live in Regent-street Kennington-cross I was eighteen years old last October—on the 2nd of December 1883 I went to live with the prisoner as porter to carry out parcels in Leadenhall-street—I slept in the house afterwards—I remember the prisoner coming to live at the house in Leadenhall-street—he carried on business in Basinghall-street before—some time after that I became pattern-card-maker and shopman—he was a woollen-draper—one evening after the shop was shut I went to the prisoner s desk—it was about the month of April—he called to me after the shop was shut and said John as my clerk is out I must make you clerk to-night and then wrote across a piece of paper the name of Joyce or Rice and desired me to copy it across two blank stamps which I did—he said nothing more about it—about six weeks or two months afterwards after the shop was shut he called me again and wrote the name of Joyce or Rice and desired me to write it—I wrote this C Still across this bill by command of the prisoner about the month of September and about eleven o clock in the day—he took me up into the drawing-room shut the door and desired me to sit down till he was ready for me—I believe he locked the door—I sat down—in about five minutes he produced two blank stamps one of them a printed one which is this one—he wrote across a slip of paper C Still and desired me to copy it across the two blank stamps which I did—one of them is the one produced—he said nothing to me after I had done it—this is the one which had printing on it and I am certain that the other was not printed—there was no writing on it whatever except C Still which I wrote by his direction—on the Sunday following I mentioned this at home—I believe the house of Bentley and Co had not failed at that time—there was a person in the prisoner s employ named Jeremiah Mitchell—in consequence of what I heard of the transaction of Bentley and Co I mentioned this transaction to Mitchell—up to that time I knew nothing of the nature of accommodation bills—I have frequently seen the prisoner write—the filling up of the body of this bill I firmly believe to be his handwriting Q Look at the words at 169 Leadenhall-street City A I believe that to be Mr Little s and the indorsement I believe to be his also—on the 30th of January I remember this bill being presented at Leaden-hall-street—I knew it when it was so presented—I was at the Mansion-house on the 3rd of February when the prisoner was to be examined—I saw him in the lobby with Roe the officer—the prisoner came up to me and said John have you told any thing or words to that effect—I cannot remember his exact words—what he said first to me was John have you got to appear against me —I said I believed I had but I did not know but I believed I had—he said If you have for God s sake mind what you say for we shall be both transported for life if you do not Q You said he said Have you told any thing A Yes that was his brother—his brother likewise spoke to me—that was a mistake of mine Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q His brother was not in custody was he A No—I made a mistake in saying the prisoner said Have you told any thing —it was a gentleman who I believe to be his brother—I was very much surprised at the prisoner saying I should be transported—I had no notion that any thing was wrong—I did not know I was accepting a bill—I did not put the word Accepted to it but I have learned since that it was an acceptation—I had not the slightest notion of that at the time—I had seen a bill before but had always been in the habit of seeing the word Accepted —I never saw one without that word—I did not know what he wanted it done for—I thought he could not possibly ask me to do what was wrong—I knew he could write himself—I thought it odd that he did not write it himself—I did not ask why he did not—I thought I had no right to ask my governor any questions—I had been in service before with a person named Buck a stationer in the Westminster-road and with Jones also Willet and Dineley proctors and Payne a dyer—the proctors were not notaries to my knowledge—my uncle Mr Whitaker is alive—I was never in his service—I was living in his house about seven years ago before I went into any body s service—I left of my own free will Q Did your uncle tax you with any thing before you left A That has nothing to do with it—he did not—I think it has nothing to do with it—very likely my uncle is here and you can ask him—he has found fault with me perhaps for a great many things—I left his house to go to Mr Jones—I do not remember what fault he found with me last—I cannot think of one particular fault at present Q Will you swear positively he never found fault with you for any thing he thought dishonest A I believe he did—I do not know exactly what it was about—he used to say when I went out on errands I used to charge more for the things than I actually paid—that was four or five months before I left him—he charged me with doing it on several occasions—he did not tell me he did not wish to keep me in his house any longer on account of his suspicions Q You never quarrelled in Mr Little s house with any of the family A Never not with any of the family—his wife never accused me of any thing to my knowledge—she never accused me of theft—I can bring witnesses to prove that he placed the greatest reliance possible on me—his sister never accused me of theft nor was any thing of the sort mentioned all the while I was there—she never accused me of pilfering pence and halfpence from the change—I was never charged with keeping back 8d which I got in change for potatoes nor with the beer money—there was never any row about 24l which I had to pay a bill with—I was in the habit of taking up bills for Mr Little—he never had permission to use other persons names in bills to my knowledge—I was never accused by any body in the house of secreting a sovereign out of 24l which I had to pay a bill nor of secreting the least thing not even a pin—I paid a great many bills towards the last six months and never saw a bill without the word Accepted to it JURY Q You have been in the habit of presenting bills to customers A No I never presented a bill—I did not know I was committing a forgery when I was accepting the bill—I knew the acceptor of a bill was liable to pay it—I lived with Mr Buck about eighteen months ago—he kept a circulating library in Mount-street MR CLARKSON Q When you went to Mr Little did you receive a character A Mr Little went after my character—I left a situation on purpose to go to him—the person I was with receive two years characters with me—I went to him from Mr Baynes in the Borough—I only lived with him three months when I was sent for by my uncle to go to the prisoner—it was entirely through my uncle that I went into the prisoner s service—I had never seen Mr Little but once before in my life—I knew Mrs Little—I had two years character when I went to live with him—this was done in September I believe—I remained with him until he assigned his goods over to his creditors—that was in December or January this year—Mr Little never complained as to my honesty—he always spoke in the highest terms possible of me—he did not charge me with any dishonesty at the Mansion-house PHILIP WHITAKER I am a cloth-factor and live in Basiaghall-slreet I know the prisoner and have seen him write—I believe the body of this Bill of Exchange to be his handwriting—I believe the words At Leadenhall-street City to be his handwriting and the indorsement—the boy has been in our service since this—I was one of the trustees under the assignment—we continued him in our employ understanding his character was good—whether that was from Mr Little I cannot be positive—if Mr Little had made any complaint of his character we should not have kept him Cross-examhied Q took at the name written over 69 Leadehall-street what is the name A It looks more like Stiell than Still - - MITCHELL I was formerly in the employ of the prisoner— looking at the bill I believe the whole of this except C Still to be the handwriting of the prisoner Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q How long were you in his employ A I went there on the 1st of September last and continued with him up to the present time nearly—he had bill transactions to a considerable extent—I understood there were a great many accommodation bills—I do not know whether he and other persons were in the habit of lending each other their names MR CLARKSON Q Do you know whether in September last he had any customer of the name of Still A A person named Still who lived at Poplar used to come and lay out a few pounds—he was not a credit customer—his name was Adam Still Q Had your employer to your knowledge any other person named Still or Stiell at Poplar except that person A No—I know he lived at Poplar but where there I do not know—he is a tailor—I have knows him many years ADAM STILL I live at Poplar I have been a customer to Mr Little but not above two or three times and then I paid cash for what I bought—I live at 148 High-street Poplar and have lived there ten years—my son Robert lives at Poplar but I do notk now any other person of our name at Poplar—this acceptance is neither my writing nor my son s—I do not know any other Still or Stiell living at Poplar—the bill is spelt perfectly in the same way as I write—it is spelt the same way as I spell my name—there is no dot over the i —I cannot see that they could make any thing else of it but i —I never saw Mr Little in my life to my knowledge—I owed him nothing Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q This is exactly the way you sign your name A No it is not—it is the way I spell my name—I should write my name as Adam Still if I accepted a bill—I should write Adam at full length—this is C —I very often dot the i —if I did not write Adam at full length I should put A not C —there are many hundreds of lodgers at Poplar

gave me 8s the first week—I said I was very much distressed and could not board him without money—he said he would get a ship and go out as steward and leave me his two months advance-note which would set all to rights—he afterwards said he was going in the Antelope for Jamaica at 2l 10s a month—he showed me the note and said he must have clothes or he could not go—I advanced him 8s and I let him have some clothes which I valued at 8s —he asked if I had a pen and ink—I gave him one—he said he would sign his name on the back or it would not do—he signed his name and read it to me and gave it to me as a just note for payment of 5l —this is the note—I put it up stain in my drawer—the policeman came to me on the Saturday and I gave him the note—he told me it was forged—the prisoner was then in custody—I got a waterman to take the note to the Antelope—the people there said it was a just note provided he went out in the ship—I inquired for Edmonds the master at Eltham-place Blackheath but could find nobody of that name—the prisoner wrote the large writing on the back of the note—I saw him do it Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did you go to Blackheath A Yes to Eltham-place—I saw

influence of liquor to give the prosecutrix a note to hold as security—purporting to be a pay-ticket for 5l which was entirely a fictitious one as I had stated therein the name of the vessel and parties which I believe were never in existence—I gave her this note in order to satisfy her until I should be able by the receipt of some money I was daily expecting to pay her though I had no intention or wish to defraud and if I had not have been so much under the excitement of liquor I should never have been guilty of practising such a deception which I so severely regretted on reflection that I was induced voluntarily to surrender myself—my prosecutrix stated that she should not have thought of prosecuting such a charge feeling convinced I should have paid her the moment I received my money—I have been seven years in the navy and had lately returned from the service of Donna Maria MR PAYNE to MRS HORNCASTLE Q Had you pressed him very much for money A I told him three weeks or a month before that I was very much in want of money—he promised to give me his advance-note—the policeman came to me three days after that GUILTY Aged 35 — Transported for Life

will call as we come back — he had a porter with him with a knot —the note was opened in the prisoner s presence and he said he would come for them in half an hour—I said they would be ready—the note was opened by Hodson but in the prisoner s presence I am certain—it was not read in his hearing—they went away leaving the note—when they were gone I examined it more particularly—it purports to come from John Goodhart of Lamb s Conduit-street who is a customer of ours—it was spelt Goodheart instead of hart—in consequence of that I sent to Mr Goodhart by our porter Wilson and Wicks one of his

hope you will forgive me —he was asked if he knew the order was a forged one—he said he was not aware of it as he did not write it—that he received it from Wilson at the bottom of

he was to meet Wilson that evening at nine o clock in Wood-street but gave no description of what part of the street Prisoner s Defence On the 20th of May as I was proceeding to the west end of the town I promiscuously met Wilson on the other side of Smithfield and a porter with him I had not seen him for some months—he appeared in a great hurry—after a few minutes conversation he requested me to deliver the note for him—I said I would—he gave me the note and said The porter will go with you I am in an immediate hurry I am going down Cheapside into Wood-street —I understood he meant to say he lived in Wood-street—he said he would meet me there in three-quarters of an hour and if not between eight and nine o clock—I never knew where he lived except that he told me the last time I saw him that he lived at Barnet and likewise at some other part of the country—when I took the note to Bedwell and Yates I delivered it to the young man—I was going away—he directly opened it and said Who is it from —I said From a young man —I don t recollect that I mentioned the name at the moment—I was asked whether it was private or an order—I said I supposed it was an order—the porter was standing at the door and said Mr Wilson will be waiting for you if you will go down it is the first house on the left-hand side —I had before asked Wilson which house it was and he said the first house after coming out of Cripplegate—I went down there and waited half or three-quarters of an hour but did not see him—I returned again and was going to the west end of the town—Mr Bedwell s house was just in the direction I was going—I went in to ask if Wilson had called there as he had told me he should call there after meeting a friend in Wood-street—I did not ask if Wilson had been there but if the young man had been there—one of the young men laid his hand on me and said I want to speak to you —I walked into the room—they questioned me respecting the contents of the note which I acknowledged I did not know—after their explaining to me the contents of it I said I did not know the particulars but meeting him with an apron on I supposed it was an order—when I came back I was detained—the porter was standing at the door when I came in but he was not the man who was with Wilson when I first met him—if they had stopped that man as well as me he could have explained where he met Wilson and given the full particulars for I suppose he bad been waiting there all the time I was absent which was three-quarters of an hour—when I saw the porter there I did not know at the moment whether he was the man who bad been with Wilson but they said There is a porter outside is he the man —I said I had not seen him and one of the young men said he had run away—I certainly said I hoped they would forgive me for receiving the note as I did not know it was forged—being so well acquainted with Mr Goodhart s name I knew how to spell it as well as my own—it would be most unlikely I should spell his name wrong if I had written it GUILTY on the Second Count Aged 28 — Transported for Life Before Mr Baron Gurney

heard what passed—he came into the shop to my wife and said he was now living at Stratford-place with a family and be wanted to have some biscuits sent to the house—he said Mrs Cotton his mistress had dined out with one of my customers and she was very foad of my bread but the bread he could say nothing about at present but we were to send the biscuits up before six o clock that evening—I then went forwards—he said How do you do I said Very well he said Can you give me change for a bill and believing him to be a respectable young man I said Yes —my son was by my side and whispered to me not to do it but I did—I gave him change for a cheque for 10l 5s 6d —my son went directly into the City to receive the cheque but returned in less than half an hour without any money—he went so inquire if Mr Cotton lived where the prisoner said Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did you know the prisoner in Sir Richard Glynn s service A Yes I thought he bore and deserved a very good character or I should not have cashed the cheque—he did not tell me that he received it of a person who told him he was living at Mr Cotton s—I was unwilling to prosecute him it is his own fault he is here I was sent for to the office and said It is your own fault that you are here —my son had met him in the street CHRISTIAN PHILIP DILL JUN I was in the counting-house when the prisoner came to the shop—I went into the shop—he chose different sorts of biscuits and begged them to be sent about six o clock to Mr Cotton s 8 Stratford-place—while I was packing them up he went into the parlour and was speaking to my father—I followed after finishing the biscuits and found my father was changing the cheque—I advised him not to do it in consequence of my suspicions on looking at the cheque as the date was altered—any father said he thought it was good and gave him the change—as the prisoner left he said Be sure to send the biscuits by six o clock —I wished to go to the banker s immediately with the cheque—I went to Bosanquet s where it was refused—I returned home and mentioned it to my father and went immediately to Stratford-place to Mr Cotton and made inquiry—I met the prisoner accidentally about six weeks afterwards—he was on the opposite side of the way in Regent-street—I recognised him immediately but allowed him to pass me—he stopped and looked in at a shop window—I passed him then turned round and found he had turned back—I turned into Castle-street and saw him drinking a glass of beer at the bar of a public-house—I could not have a distinct view of him there and let him come out again—he crossed over and I saw that it was him—I followed him to Prince s-street Cavendish-square—I touched him on the shoulder and said I wanted him—he turned round appeared rather confused and said What for —I said I dare say he knew—he said Let me go —I said no I wished him to come to Oxford-street with me—he drew a paper from his pocket which appeared the same sort of paper as the cheque was written on—I said You have got another of them I suppose —he said Of what —I said You know very well —he then put it into his pocket—a cab came by shortly afterwards—I asked the cabman to come down as I wanted to speak to him and in that time he put the paper into his mouth and swallowed it—several people came round—I begged him to show what he was eating but he would not and after he had swallowed it he pulled out a piece of dry orangepeel and said that was what he was earting—I gave him in charge for forgery Cross-examined Q Was the alteration you observed the figure 8 to 28 A Yes—I should think bankers would refuse to take cheques when the date is altered—I advised my father not to cash it on account of the alteration in the date—I do not think the prisoner heard me—he was two or three yards from me and I spoke very low indeed I whispered very low—he could have gone out of the way if he liked I belive he was very anxious to get out of my way or why should he pass me and turn back—I am not in partnership with my father JOHN HUNT I am a policeman The prisoner was given into my cstody by the last witness on the 24th of June about a quarter after three o clock in the afternoon for forgiving a cheque for 10l 5d —the prisoner said he had not given him a cheque at all nor had a farthing of money at all from him—I told him he must go to the station-house he said he could mot go—I said Why —he said Because I am a gentleman s servant and my master is waiting for me —I said Where does your master live you have no occasion to be frightened if you have done nothing amiss —he would not tell me where his master lived—I told him three times if he would tell me where his master lived and he was detained at the station-house I would go and let his master know but I could not make him hear at all till I got to Old Cavendish-street—he then said I am a servant out of a situation is there any way by which I can escape I looked at him and said nothing—he said Can t you let me go —I said If I let you go I shall lose my situation and then we shall neither of us have a situation —I asked where he lodged—he would not bear again—I said nothing more to him but took him to the station-house JOSEPH ALEXANDER COTTON I live at No 18 Stratford-place This is not my cheque nor of any of my family-none of us bank at Bosanquet s—No 8 where it is dated from has been empty

entirely innocent of the charge as it respects any knowledge that the instrument was forged or it is not probable I should go to a person I sop well knew as Mr Dill—he is mistaken in supposing I said I was in Mr Cotton s service—It was the man who gave it to me—of course I am unable to bring the man forward from whom I got it as he must be the man by whom it was forged or who knew it was so—I

the City The prisoner was in my service as a junior clerk and had been so about seven years—I was in partnership with my son—I kept a cash account with Messrs Stone—the prisoner continued in his place until the 13th of March and then left without our knowledge—In consequence of something I heard I afterwards saw this cheque in the possession of my bankers—I never drew this cheque nor was it drawn by my authority nor by any body authorised to draw—my son signs cheques I believe the hand-writing in the body of the cheque to be the prisoner s—the signature is disguised to appear like my son s but the body of it is not disguised—the prisoner was not in the habit of filling up cheques—the signature I believe is not my son s hand-writing—I cannot say whose it is Cross-examined Q Was any one authorised to draw cheques besides yourself and son A The cashier but he signs his own name for Easthope and Son —nobody was authorised to sign Easthorpe and Son besides ourselves—the prisoner bore a

period up to the 12th of March I was in the habit of drawing cheques—I believe the body of this £400 cheque is the prisoner s hand-writing—the cheques I draw are signed for Easthope and Son with my own name—I did not give the prisoner authority to draw either of these cheques—It is the custom of our house to number the cheques in the order in which they leave the counting-house—the numbers in use about the 12th of March were about the same as these—the 400l is dated on the 12th ofr March and the 12l 10s on the 11th—the cheques were looked up at night—they were in the counting-house in the day-time—the prisoner would have access to that place—there are three clerks including the prisoner and myself WILLIAM COLE I am cashier in the banking-house of Messrs Stone This cheque for 12l 10s

of the City police In consequence of information I took the prisoner into custody on the 19th of June at Gravesend—I did tell him the charge—I searched him and found two keys on him—one was the of a carpet-bag and the other of some drawers I was searching the drawers and said I do not find what I want —he said You will come to it presently and the bottom of the drawer I found a carpet-bag—key opened it and I found 31 soverigns three £4 notes and a 1000 franc note—I found a pair of mustachios in a pocket book in the pocket of the coat which hung up in the room and he had a dark wig on at the time I apprehended him and I found in the drawers some dye for the hair cheque read Prisoner s Defence I have been allowed to plead Not Guilty to afford myself a chance of escaping the rigour of the law I am encouraged to hope the Court will listen to a brief narrative of circumstances whcih led me to the commission of the crime—I not only knowledge but I deeply feel the enormity of the crime but some circumstances connected with my melanchloy case you may not deem unworthy of your notice—very early in life I lost my father—I was placed in a situation when quite a child and lived with Mr Atkinson a respectable bill-broker about two years—I gave him such satisfaction that he obtained a situation with the prosecutors for me—I was their junior clerk upwards of seven years and endeavoured to merit their approbation—this my long stay in their service will sufflciently prove I had earned their confidence—my name was entered in the books of the Stock Exchange and I became acquainted with many persons which led me into extravagant habits which so oppressed my mind I sought to obtain another situation but without effect in order to avoid the temptations I was continually exposed to—my resolution was so week that all my attempts to disengage myself from my gay acquaintances were fruitless—with a view to remedy this evil I got married but rashly and unadvisedly and having but 1l a year I could not maintain a wife—I became embarrassed and almost distracted and with hopes of being able to repay the amount was tempted to commit the crime it being my first offence and I assure you it shall be my last—I am the roughest of eight children of a respectable family—I had no father to take charge of me when young and was exposed in the midst of temptations which I thought to stop but the means I adopted involved me tenfold more—I had just entered life and all the hopes of myself and wife will be by your decision blasted and the feelings of a fond mother deeply wounded—I entreat your Lordship to take this statement into your kind consideration and whatever may be my sentence should I ever be able my conscience will compel me to repay every farthing of the money obtained by means of the forged cheque Mr Atkinson bill-broker St Mildred s-court Henry Joseph Page his clerk and Henry Haines carver and gilder George-street Hampstead-road gave the prisoner a good character

the prosecution CHARLES GINNEVER KEWNEY I am a hosier and live at Nottingham I have two partners—we had transaction with a firm named M Mahon and Co of London—the prisoner was represented as one of that firm and was so I belive—they owed us between 13 000l and 14 000l —in April last we made application for part of that amount I afterwards came to London—their place of buisness was in Wood-street Cheapside—I went there on Monday morning the 20th of April—I saw the prisoner first at our own warchouse in Maiden-lane before I went there I called his attention to the account—he said he had paid part of it at our town warehouse—that was not true—in the afternoon of that day he made me a payment of between 500l and 600l in bill and cash—there was not 50l of it in case—the rest was in bills—the bill in question of 109l 16s 10d was among them— produced —it was accepted as it now is—he made no observation about it—it was presented for payment and dishonoured—no such person was to be found JOHN

father has been dead these four years—his friends are curries—he lives with his brothers—there are no other George Ormerods there—I have made inquiry JOHN BROWN I am clerk to Cunliff Brooks and Co bankers—we have no customer of the name of Ormerod to my knowledge Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You say not to your knowledge A Yes it is a country account—my knowledge on the subject is not derived from our books—I do not know the whole of our country customers—my knowledge of the town accounts would be derived from the books—we have a balance-sheet sent up from Manchester—I have looked at that at home—I have not got it here—my knowledge of the country accounts is derived in some instances from that balance-sheet—we might have such a customer without his name being in the balance-sheet—I looked at it for the purpose of seeing whether there was such an account in it—they would be irregular customers that are not included in the balance sheet—they are all chance customers—a person would pay the commission on a bill at Manchester made payable at our house and our house at Mancheater advises us of the money and the commission being paid and we pay it at the town-hous—that description of customers may amount to 100 in a year—I connot retain their names in my memory MR BODKIN Q Regular customers in the country would appear in the balance-sheet A Yes I have searched that balance-sheet with a view to this transaction—I did not find any such name as George Ormerod—there has been no remittance made on account of this bill—it was not paid on being presented at our house there being no advice of the money being paid MR PHILLIPS Q To whom would that bill be presented at your house A To myself or Mr Grey—I connot of my own knowledge swear it was not presented to Mr Gray—he is not here MR BODKIN Q Whoever presented it you say it was not paid A it was not COURT Q How do you know it was not paid A Because we have no advice of it JOHN HARDMAN I am an attorney and live at Rochdale I have lived there ten years and was born there—I have made very diligent inquiry to find out George Ormerod—I found one of that name a publican living at Catley-lane-bead three or four miles from Rochdale—that is the only one I could find expect the school-boy at Rochdale and there is a son of George Ormerod of Catley-head-lane Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You found a school-boy of that name A Yes at Rochdale—his father is dead—I knew him—the population of Rochdale is about 24 000—it is not a place that people visit—I have no knowledge of any lodging-hous there—manufacturers are constantly coming and going—I would not swear that there might not be a George Ormerod living there for a fortnight or a month—I speak merely of the habitual residents of the place MR CLARKSON Q Do you speak from the inquiry you have made on purpose to discover the acceptor of the bill A I do GEORGE ORMEROD I am a publican and live at Catley-lane-head near Rochdale—the acceptance of this bill is not my handwriting—I know nothing of it—I have a son George—I know no other George Ormerod near us—it is not my son s handwriting—he is twenty-six years old and drives my team Cross-examined Q What did you say when asked if there was any other person of that name near the place A Not within miles —there are many Ormerod s in Lancashire—I go to Rochdale sometimes—there may be lodging-houses there GEORGE ORMEROD I live at Coop about seven miles from Rochdale—I cannot write and did not write this acceptance nor authorise any body to write my name to any bill Cross-examined Q Do you know any other George Ormerod about the place A No I only know the last witness—I never saw his son George GEORGE ORMEROD of Catley-lane-head re-examined I know George Ormerod at Fearon-hill seven or eight miles from me and about eight miles from Rochdale WILLIAM WAUGH LEE I am the son of the Post-mistress of Rochdale—I have delivered letters there upwards of twenty years—I do not know any George Ormerod there except the currier s son the school-boy—there is one lives at Catley-lane-head and one at Coop and one at Fearon-hill—he is of the firm of George Ormerod and Son s of Watler-barns—it is near Rochdale seven or eight miles off—I do not know a George Ormerod living there—Walter-barns are the works belonging to the firm at Fearon-hill JOHN FINNEY I am an accountant and live in Watling-street I know the prisoner and frequently saw him write—the acceptance to this bill is his handwriting I never no doubt Cross-examined Q Will you swear it positively A My answer was That is the handwriting of the prisoner I have no doubt —I connot say when I saw him write last—it was from the middle of April and during the wbole of May this year—I saw him write at his own place No 6 Wood-street—I connot say that I have seen this before— looking at two papers —it is possible—I connot say whose handwriting this is—I have seen the prisoner attempt to write various hands—I have seen him writing on paper and it possibly might be this very piece of paper—I have witnessed the different kinds of handwriting he could write—he has attempted to do so—the acceptance of this bill is his natural handwriting—I have compared it with his books letter by letter—the moment I cast my eye on the bill I said That is Mr Hoyle s handwriting without any reference—I compared it letter by letter on account of the seriousness of the affair—I have seen his writing in the day-book of M Mahon and Hoyle—it was writing which he has stated to me to be his—not when I have seen him write but I have seen his write very frequently and have seen him write in the books—the books were not kept by one Tillidge—I have seen Tillidge write—the body of this bill I should say is Mr Tillidge s haadwriting WILLIAM SPERING I was in the employ of M Mahon and Co of Wood-street as warehouseman and traveller the prisoner was one of the firm—I have frequently seen him write—I belive this acceptance to be his handwriting Cross-examined Q When did you him write last A About the 9th of May—it is his ordinary handwriting—I have seen the bill since it has been returned—it was shown to me to examine—the body of the bill is written by Tillidge and it is singed by Thomas M Mahon himself—it is his genuine signature ELIAS TILLIDGE I was formely clerk to Messrs M Mahon and Co —the prisoner was one of the firm—I have seen this bill before—the body of it is any handwriting—I wrote it by the prisoner s direction—I have frequently seen the prisoner write and have not the least doubt of the acceptance being his handwriting Cross-examined Q Do you know batchelor A No I know a man named B atchelor came in and bought some goods—Hoyle used to know him—I never said that the words Payable at and George Ormerod were not the prisoner s handwriting MR CLARKSON Q Do you know Batchelor except from what the prisoner told you A Not at all—I did not know his name WILLIAM HENMAN I am a City policeman I took the prisoner into custody on the charge of forging a bill of 109l on Mr Kewney of Nottingham—he asked me to treat him with kindness and he would be quiet—I told him I certainly would treat him with kindness if he would be quiet— I took him at his house at Hoxton-New-town —he immediately made his escape and ran out of the house—I pursed him and secured him in the next street—I took him to the station-house in Stoke-Newington-road and on fetching him from there while he was in the cab going to the Compter he seemed anxious to say something—I cautioned him and said it was a serious charge and what he said to me might perhaps be evidence against him and he had better say nothing—he said it could not affect his case the charge of forgery they could not prove but that I was very lucky if I had not taken him that night I should not have taken him at all for he would have been off next morning where nobody would have found him JOHN FINNEY re-examined It was my duty to inquire into the validity of the sundry bills—I asked the prisoner about this bill—he said the acceptor was a respectable draper living at Rochdale Bill read Prisoner s Defence I claim your attention I trust you have not made up your minds to send me over the water without hearing me speak I did not run away for fear of being taken for forgery when I said if I had not been taken that night I should have gone where I could not be found I meant to say my family would have been removed where he would not have found me that day for I had been apprised that my old assigees were going to lay hold of my furniture and meant to move tomorrow to save it You have had one or two witnesses to swear to my handwriting in answer to their evidence I shall produce a clerk in my employ whom will mpositively swear the bills are not in my handwriting that witness has seen more of my handwriting than any person in court no part of the acceptance is my writing In March last I became acquainted with John Batchelor and asked him to recommend us customers about the 28th of March he called at our warehouse and said a friend of his Mr Mitchell of Rochdale had come to town and he would bring him on Monday I received a note requesting me to meet him at the Three Bucks in Eaton-street he said he had a commission from some persons in Rochdale to purchase hosiery and named a house which Mitchell assured me was highly respectable and what he Mitchell lived in Drake-street Rochdale I took down the orders which being large I thought it better to get bills accepted than give them three months credit I afterwards stated this to Mitchell who stated that if I would draw the bills he would send them down to Rochdale for acceptance On the 1st of April I told Tillidge to draw the bills four were drawn I gave them to Mitchell who promised to get them accepted on the 12th of April Batchelor called at my private residence and gave me the bills accepted by Ormerod and Co and said he had received them in a parcel from Mitchell who had returned to Rochdale the prosecutor afterwards called on me for the payment of his account 213l which was due in cash my partner paid him cash and bills accounting to I believe 239l he said he would get the bills discounted and return the balance observing I had I had other bills he offered to get them discounted too and I gave him the one in question and three others about the 23rd of April I sent for the proceeds but he refused to give it up till he saw what turn our affairs took and being fearful as our stock was destroyed by fire that we might become embarrassed we would not press him for it The prisoner entered into other particulars respecting his commercial transactions but not reffering to the charge FIELD ASHWORTH I live in Silver-street Cheapside—I have known the prisoner for the last ten years—I have seen him write a good deal—I am well acquainted with his handwriting—this acceptance is not like his regular handwriting COURT Q Do you believe it to be his handwriting A I believe not MR CLARKSON Q Are you the person the prisoner calls his clerk A I do not know—I have been his clerk not his porter—I do not know whose handwriting this indorsement Thomas M Mahon is—it looks more like the prisoner s handwriting than the other—I do not mean to say that the acceptance is not his handwriting I merely tell you what I think—I did not see it written—he did not write different hands when I have seen him write—he generally wrote a plain hand like a school-hand—this indorsement is nearly like his general hand—there is not exactly a likeness between the two not so as to show it is the same hand—I know Mr White the prosecutor s agent in London—when the charge was first made against the prisoner I called at White s—I met a person I knew at Rochdale named Stirling and he said White wanted to speak to me—he asked me to go over and I did—we talked about this charge Q Did you tell White you had no doubt the prisoner forged the acceptance of both the bills for you knew he had paid 20l to take up a forged acceptance the day before A I do not recollect that—I will swear I never did say so—I did not see the 20l bill and never knew what it was but I knew there was something wrong about it—it was not proved under the bankruptcy and this sane bill had been paid—I believe I had been informed so six weeks ago in the country—I was informed that bill was taken up by Hoyle s friends—I might make use of the word forged on that occasion—I never meant to say it was forged I might have said it was a bad bill—I never said that I knew the prisoner had forged that bill to my knowledge—I did not use the word forged to the best of my knowledge—I do not recollect saying I knew the bill had been forged—I never said the prisoner had forged Ormerod s name or the name of David Lord—I had never seen the bills—I came from the neighbourhood of Rochdale and so did the prisoner—I do not know George Ormerod a draper there—I have not been down there since the prisoner was committed—I do not know a man of the name of George Ormerod there—I know a good deal of Rochdale—I was in town when the prisoner was examined the second time at the Mansion House—I was at the examination—I did not state any thing—I heard some of the witnesses say it was his handwriting but I never saw the bill—I have been to France twice—I gave over business there—I did not abscond—I was not forced to go—I went on a journey of pleasure—I was never a great deal indebted—I did not go to France to avoid my creditors the first time—nor the second I went for pleasure both times Q Were you able then to pay your debts A I do not think proper to answer that question COURT Q When did you first see this bill A To-day—I came at the prisoner s request to see the bill to speak to his handwriting—it was never shown to me SAMUEL WHITE I am agent in London for the prosecutors—I recollect Ashworth coming to my warehouse before the prisoner s committal—he told me he had no doubt the prisoner had forged the acceptance in question and gave as his reason that he had had to take up an acceptance for 20l forged for him about a month before the conversation—we were speaking of the acceptances of George Ormerod and David Lord—he came into our warehouse and said I had sent for him but I had not—Thomas M Mahon was in the warehouse at the time—he said he had not the least doubt that the acceptance was forged for he knew that the prisoner had taken up a 20l forged bill lying in other parties hands in the country and that was about a month before MR KEWNEY re-examined I received the bill in their warehouse in the City GUILTY Aged 29 — Transported for Life Before Mr Sergeant Bosanquet

King-street Westminster I have known the prisoner some years as a customer coming to my house—I do not know what he is—he came to my house on the 13th of June and asked me to accommodate him with a bed for a night or two—having seen him often before I said I would—he stopped until the 23rd of June and that morning he brought me a cheque on Masterman s for 10l —he told me it was given to him by Mr Smith the night before but it was too late to get it cashed—he said Smith lived at No 14 Lincoln s-inn-fields—he wished me to let him have a few pounds on the cheque as he had to meet some friends at the Zoological Garends and had not time to go to receive it and I could keep the rest against his bill—he gave me the cheque—I let him have 5l on it—he owed me 1l 18s 2d —he went away and a I saw nothing more of him till the last day of the month when I took him into custody at Knightsbridge—I delivered the cheque to Hart to get it cashed—he returned the same cheque to me—when I took the prisoner I asked him how he could act so wrong as to give me the paper which was good for nothing—he said he would go with me to No 14 Lincoln s-inn-fields and clear up his point at once—I went with him and no such person ever lived there—he was in custody—the officer was with us—this is cheque he gave me THOMAS BRAND I am casiler to Masterman and Co This cheque was presented about the 23rd or 24th of June—I returned it writing on it No account —we have an account with Thomas Smith of Bermondsey-grange—it is not his writing—I do not know the prisoner at all THOMAS SMITH I am a tanner and live at Bermondsey I bank at Masterman s—this is not my handwriting—I know nothing of the prisoner DANIEL DAWKINS I am a policeconstable I accompained Gilpin to the Guardsman public-house and took the prisoner into custody—he said Mr Smith of No 14 Lincoln s-inn-fields gave him the cheque—we went there but could find no such person—he then said Smith gave it to him near Temple-bar as part of some money he had got on some estates of his he being his attorney—I searched him at the station-house and found on him part of a sheet of a paper corresponding with the paper the cheque was written on in every particular—the water-mark agrees in the creases Prisoner The prosecutor says I had 5l it was only 4l J GILPIN re-exmined I had given him 1l the Saturday before—I gave him 4l and said This is 5l Prisoner s Defence About the 28th of June I went to the Innertemple to see Mr Hill an attorney and while inquiring for him I saw a person named Smith who said he had removed from there and he did not know where—that he himself was an attorney living at No 14 Lincoln s-inn-fields and would be happy to do any thing for me—I agreed to meet him on the following Monday when I met him at four o clock in the afternoon—I told him I was entited to some money in the funds belonging to my sister and me and wished his advise as to selling the stock out—he said if it was in the funds it was easily done—he left me and in a quarter of an hour returned with what he said was a power or attorney which I signed and gave it to him to take to Mr Brooks a stock-broker who had done business for my family many years with instructions to sell the stock out—when he got the power of attorney he asked how long I had been in town—I told him—he asked how I was off for money—I said I was very short and was about writing home for some—he said he would supply me and asked if 10l or 20l would do and said he would give me a cheque on his banker—he left me a few minutes and returened with the cheque written on a half sheet of paper—I parted the paper and put the cheque into my pocket—on the following morning I bad to go to the Zoological Gardens and asked the prosecutor to give me cash for the cheque—after going to the Zoological Gardens I went to Knightsbridge-barracks—I was formerly in a regiment—I stopped at the barracks all night and next morning I went to Mr Brooks to know when the stock would be sold—he said a person answering Smith s description had been with the power of attorney but he declined to act on it not liking Smith s appearance—I said he had given me a cheque for 10l —he said it might be all night but he did not like the appearence of the man—a few days after the prosecutor came with an officer and said the cheque was bad—I explained how I got it and proposed to go to Lincoln s-inn-fields to see it Smith resided there but could hear nothing of him—had I been guilty I should not have had the half sheet of paper about me—I could have no possible motive for committing the forgery for the prosecutor would have lent me the 5l without the cheque—Mr Brook s can prove Smith s calling on him DANIEL DAWKINS re-examined I found the paper in his pocket-book—I have compared the cheque with the water-mark—I believe they were one and the same sheet of paper Prisoner I admit it—I tore it from the paper myself JOHN GILPIN re-examined I should not have lent him the 5l without the cheque—he showed me documents of property which he said belonged to his father—I thought it all right GUILTY of uttering Aged 33 — Transported for Life

from my brother-in-law what I was to do before I went there and in consequence of that I wrote aceptances to these four bills in blank looking at them and delivered them to Benjamin Levison without any drawer s name on them—he delivered me this paper without the writing across Received 20l on account 31st July 1835 T C —these words were not on it when I received it from him—the paper was brought

and produced this note to him—I am positive I showed it to him as my introduction—he was sitting at a table with some papers before him writting—I spoke to him in English and be asswered me in English—I told him I had called in consequence of this note which was directed to W H and then he called for Benjamin Levison—I had the letter in my hand when I told him so and showed it to him—I said in the presence of them both that I had come from Mr Stephens who was the party that wrote under those initials and asked the terms on which they would advance 150l —Benjamin answered me in the presence of the prisoner—he told me that for three six and nine months they would advance the money at a bonus of 7l and for three six nine and twelve months 10l —the prisoner appeared to be attending to what Benjamin said—he sat at the same table—Benjamin said that the prisoner was optician to the King of the Netherlands and had a large sum of money to lend—that was all that passed on that occasion—I went again the following week about the middle of July and saw the prisoner alone—he called Benjamin in before I said any thing and Benjamin in his presence asked if Mr Stephens would give any further security whether either of the refrees would become a party to the bill—I had given them refrences before—it was agreed at this interview to give four bills—Benjamin Levison drew the form in the prisoner s presence for four bills at three six nine and twelve months for 40l each the signature to be left blank—the prisoner saw the paper delivered to me—I cannot find it—I have looked for it and believe it to be destroyed—the bills were drawn exactly from that form—when I was asked to give security I told him Mr Stephens objected to give the references as parties to the bill but he had a life-policy which he would give as collateral security for the payment of the bills Q Did you say deposit or give A I said he would let them have or give or deposit—I said he would let them have it as a collateral security—I am sure I said as a collateral security for the payment of the money to be advanced—nothing further passed at that interview—the bills were to be drawn—on the 24th of July I went again and saw both Benjamin and Jacob—at the two first interviews the prisoner asked me in English to sit down and said Good morning and so on but he generally had Benjamin as his clerk to transact the buisness for him—he attended to what was going on—he gave his whole attention to what was going on—Benjamin spoke to him while the conservation was going on several times—he applied to him several times—on the 24th of July I took the four bills previously accepted by Stephens to No 5 Broad-street-buildings—the drawer s name was not then or them—I also took this policy of insurance—Benjamin and the prisoner were both together on that occasion—I observed the prisoner write from time to time when I was there—I expected to receive the money on that occasion and applied for it in the prisoner s presence for the 150l —Benjamin said the money was not ready—that he wished to know from his attorney whether the policy without a deed of assignment was a collateral security—he said his attorney was Mr Croft—he said We wish to ascertion from Mr Croft our attorney —I believe he said he lived somewhere in the Strand—I am sure he said collateral —on this occasion the prisoner did not communicate with Benjamin—he was sitting and had a book in his hand pretending to read—he did not appear to me to be reading—he seemed to look up as if he was watching what was going forward—I left the policy—I laid it down on their table—the prisoner was sitting at a little distance from the table at that time—Benjamin Levison opened the policy and read it—the prisoner did not come near to look at it or the bills—an appointment was made by Benjamin in his presence to meet that evening at Barnard s-inn Coffee-house—I went there at the time appointed and saw Benjamin there—Mr Wormald and Mr Stephens were with me—the bills were produced at this meeting—I had them myself—the drawer s name was not on them then—Benjamin did not bring the money with him—we stated that we did not wish to part with the bills till the money was forthcoming—he brought the policy with him and he had a memorandum that he held that—this is the paper he gave me No 2 —the name of Minter Hert was mentioned—I rather think it was by Wormald—he said I know there have been circumstances of persons losing their bills and securities too and mentioned Minter Hart—Benjamin Levison said this was different as Mr Stephens had paid for the stamps himself—if he misappropriated them it would be felony—I delivered the bills to him after he gave me this memorandum without the writing across it—it was signed as it is now— J M Levison —I required Benjamin to put his name as a winess to the signature—he did so and represented it as the signature of J M Levison —I have been to the prisoner s place I suppose a dozen times altogether—I saw him write at his own place—at the Computer and before the Magistrate—I have seen him write perhaps five or six times and believe the signature J M Levison to be his writing—I know Benjamin s writing—I saw him write his name to it—I believe this letter No 4 to be the writing of the prisoner—This Received 20l on account is Benjamin Levison s writing and this note No 1 is his writing—after this memorandum was given we separated—Benjamin said they got the bills discounted at a lower rate of premium—that was the first I heard of their being discounted at all—on Monday the 27th of July I went again to Broad-street-buildings and saw both the praties there—Benjamin said he had not seen the attorney but if I would walk with him he would go with me as it would be part of my way towards the West—I have no doubt the prisoner heard that—he was close to Benjamin—I was to walk with him to St Clement s-church-yard—I do not recollect that the prisoner made any observation—the policy was then lying on the table with the bills—the prisoner was sitting at the table with the policy and bills on it and Benjamin said he would take the policy with him Prisoner I was on the sofa and never troubled myself about the business at all Witness He sat on a chair at the table and was attending to the business—Benjamin took up the policy and went with me as far as St Clement s-church-yard—when we got there Benjamin requested me to wait at a coffee-house while he went to the attorney—I did so—he returned and said it would be necessary to have an assignment and he would get the attorney to do it and settle the business the following day—we parted—I went again the following day and saw both the parties together at Broad-street—buildings—the prisoner was sitting at the table in the room and the bills were in a large bill—case on the table—Benjamin took them out of the case to show me that they were all right and the policy was there too—he said the attorney had gone to Margate and the assignment was delayed in consequence and it was not made out—I had consented for a draft of it to be drawn to be submitted to Mr Stephens or his attorney—it was to be assigned as a collateral security for the payment of the money—it was never mentioned that the policy was to be sold or parted with—I went again on Thursday the 30th of July—the prisoner and Benjamin were both there then—Benjamin said that the money was quite ready but it was necessary before I could receive it to get a receipt signed in blank by Mr Stephens—as I was not the party they would not pay it to me—he said We cannot pay &c —I offered if the money was ready to sign the receipt for Mr Stephens but he said it must be a blank receipt with his signature as Mr Lewis a stock-broker who was to advance the money was a particular man and would have the receipt filled up in his own manner—no suggestion was made that the receipt should be used to make a sale of the policy and release the office from it—all this was said in the prisoner s presence—he was at the table and the policy and bills before him in view—I got this half-crown receipt-stamp signed in blank by Mr Stephens—I took it in that state to Broad-street—I only saw Benjamin there when I went back—it was the same day—I delivered the receipt to Benjamin and went with him to Lloyd s Coffee-house to receive the money of Mr Lewis who Benjamin said was there—when we got there Benjamin parted from me a few minutes and when he returned he said Lewis was gone and would meet me next day—I asked him for the receipt-stamp and he gave it me back—I went next day Friday the 31st to the office in Broad-street and saw both of them—I delivered the receipt-stamp to Benjamin in the prisoner s presence—he saw me deliver it to him—I asked Benjamin for a memorandum and he gave me this— reads Mr Chubb has given me a receipt which I will give him back or the money B L —he requested me to wait in the office until he came back when he would give me the 150l—the prisoner was there all the time—Benjamin was gone more than an hour or an hour and a half—I and the prisoner were talking while he was gone about what a fine city London was he mentioned other fine cities on the Continent—he talked to me all in English about the beauty of the English beef over the beef on the Continent and he mentioned some words which were similar in the English language to the French—such as table—I complained that Benjamin was gone a long time and I hoped I should get the business settled to-day and he said he hoped I should Q Was Benjamin gone long enough to go to the London Life Assurance in Cannon-street and back A Yes considerably more—on his return he said he had been gone a long time and aplogized for keeping me—but said Mr Lewis was busily engaged with Mr Ricardo on the West India-loan and he could not get to him to speak to him before—he said if I would wait about half—an—hour longer he would get the business completed—he then spoke to the prisoner in some Foreign language and they went out of the room together—they were absent about five minutes or more—Benjamin was gone the second time a little more than half-an-hour and brought me 20l on his return—I expected 150l —he produced the 20l in the prisoner s presence—I was surprised he had only brought 20l —he said in the prisoner s presence as Lewis was so very busy he had got a cheque of 20l from him and on the following day he would get me the rest—I said I hoped it would be finally settled then as he had given me so much trouble—I asked for the receipt—stamp for the 150l —Benjamin said he had been obliged to give that receipt to Mr Lewis for the 20l —but it would do again by having Mr Stephens s signature when the balance was paid to-morrow on the back of the same receipt—I gave him a memorandum for the 20l —Benjamin wrote this memorandum and I worte my initials T C on it—I gave a memorandum of having received 20l from them and I brought away that memorandum— Mr Cross produced at the examination at Guildhall the memorandum I had given them—he attended as the prisoner s attorney —I went away that day looking at the receipt No 5 —I have seen Benjamin write five or six times—I cannot say whose hand writing the body of this is—but the interlineation I hereby authorize &c I have no doubt is the writing of Benjamin Q On the other side is written J M Levison at the bottom of another memorandum A Yes I believe that to be the prisoner s writing and the body of it is Benjamin s—on Saturday the 1st of August I went and saw the prisoner alone—I told him I had called for the balance 130l for Mr Stephens—he said he would write to Mr Stephens and appoint a day—he said it could not be settled that day—he seemed perfectly to understand what I said to him and answered me in English—I expressed my dissatisfaction at it being delayed—he said he could not help it—my brother in-law handed me this letter No 4 it had been explained to the prisoner at one of the meetings where Stepheus usually dined—they were told he dined in Jermyn-street—on the Wednesday at two o clock I went to the house in Jermyn-street with Stephens but did not see any of the parties—I waited until half-past four o clock but they never came— I believe the direction of the letters also to be the prisoner s writing —I then went down to Broad-street and found the name of Levison taken off the door and that he was gone and all his goods—I could hear no tidings of him at all—I got on board the Attwood Steam-boat at the Custom-house and found the prisoner at Gravesend attempting to come on board the vessel—I had an officer with me and took him into custody—I believe the signature to the four bills of exchange to be the hand writing of the prisoner—I never in any manner authorised either of the Levisons to dispose of the policy I had received from Stephens Cross-examined Q What are you A A commercial traveller—I have not any engagement at present—I had to the end of June—I was in the house of Sewell and Sons about four months—we did not agree and I left—it was too laborious the quantity of patterns and goods I had to convey through the country—it was the hardware and toy trade—I had been with Harwood and Co before that for about six months and they altered their manner of business and wanted it done on commission WILLIAM STEPHENS re-examined Q Did you at any time see either of the persons charged on the subject of the assignment or transfer of this policy A I did on the 29th of July—Benjamin Levison brought this paper No 3 to me at Regent-street where I am employed and he said in order to make out the assignment it was necessary I should sign a declaration that I had never made any former assignment and he pointed to the latter part of this blank form—I was very busy and only read it over in haste and was going to strike my pen across the upper part which says I hereby propose to surrender &c and he stopped me and said Do not do so leave that to the attorney —the assignment was to be for a collsteral security only—nothing passed on the subjects of the assignment except as to it being a collateral security—I was busy and signed it—it was blank then it has since been filled up by the number of the policy—I was not at all aware that by signing that I was either surrendering my policy or giving authority to any body to dispose of it—I never agreed to do so and never thought I was doing so—I was engaged with my employer at the time and was anxious to get rid of him—I was pressed very much for money MR PAYNE to THOMAS CHUBB Q Was it not in consequence of receiving the letter in Benjamin Levison s handwriting that you went to No 5 Broad-street-buildings A Yes—when I got there I saw the prisoner I told him I came in consequence of that letter—I put the letter before him—he called Benjamin to come to me—I do not know why—the prisoner did not communicate with me at all on the business before Benjamin came—he only asked me to sit down—the prisoner was in the room during the conversation—he did not say any thing—he was writing the first time—I am not aware that Benjamin Levison said any thing to him about the business at the first interview—when I called once he was reading a book but his attention was evidently directed to the conversation the whole time—it was not occasionally looking off his book—I was sitting by the side of the gentleman who went with me who was talking to Mr Levison—I do not think the prisoner was reading his book—I will swear it because his attention was directed towards our conversation—he did not make any remarks but he was looking towards us—I do not believe he is deaf—when I was left alone with him I said I hoped he would get the business settled—that I hoped it would be settled—I had been conversing with Benjamin in his presence before that on the business Q Did you ever see Benjamin do any act as his clerk A Yes once writing out an order for samples of wine in the London Docks signed J M Levison that was in the prisoner s presence—when I had my interviews with Benjamin out of the house it was with him alone but he made use of the prisoner s name—the prisoner never told me that Benjamin was his agent—the prisoner was generally present—he was not present at Barnard s-inn and once when I called in Broad-street he was absent—when I was left with the prisoner he mentioned Antwerp and said it was a fine city and he mentioned some others and compared the beef of England with that of the Continent—he spoke distinctly quite sufficient for me to understand COURT Q Did he speak with hesitation or clearly A He spoke a little broken but as I could understand MR PAYNE Q Was the conversation more than half-a-dozen words on each city A During the hour and a half I was ther he was talking on various subjects not incessantly—he talked full twenty minutes altogether—I said very little—he said more than I did—he told me how they stabbed each other in some parts of the Continent JURY Q Was his conversation of that nature and to that extent as you would expect from a native except that the language was broken A Yes and when he was taken at Gravesend he asked me the officer s name and said he should write to his Consul when he got to London—I never heard him say any thing about the King of the Netherlands MR PAYNE Q When you saw him alone you told him you had called for the 130l for Mr Stephens A Yes I had seen Benjamin the day previous—he did not say Benjamin was not there and he know nothing about it he said he would write to Mr Stephens and appoint a day—on the first occasion when I went he said I am J M Levison whom the note is signed by MR CLARKSON Q About what time was it that Benjamin went out when he staid the hour and a half A I should suppose as I was there at twelve o clock it might be five or ten minutes past SAMUEL GILES I am one of the clerks in the London Life Association I produce this policy cancelled—it is dated the 31st of December 1824 for 500l on the life of Mr Stephens it was cancelled on the 31st of July this year—it was not the prisoner brought it—it was a shorter man fullfaced—he had a Jewish face—I should not have noticed it but after I was told of this I recollected the circumstance—the person came twice the first time about two o clock—he then brought this receipt but there was no order to pay the money to any one on—he returned the second time with this indorsement on it— I hereby authorize &c COURT Q There was nothing on the face of the instrument as first presented that refers to the prisoner or a person of his name A No I gave 89l 13s 8d for it Cross-examined Q Will you swear that you looked on the back of it at all when it first came A No I will not sear the indorsement was not on it I think I must have seen it if it had been—I do not know that I looked at the back but finding that the letter S in Stephens was net exactly the same as when he made the declaration I took it to the secretary and it was handed about to ascertain if it was genuine I have no reason to think the secretary looked at the back of it WILLIAM HENRY STEPHENS re-examined Q Do you remember the person of Benjamin Levison A Yes he is shorter and fuller-faced than the prisoner—I signed this paper and gave it to Benjamin to be filled up as the attorney directed—I do not know who put in these figures Cross-examined Q Upon your oath were you not very much in want of money A I was not then—I was so when I advertized—I did not give authority for the policy to be vested in Benjamin in order that he might have the money supposing the bills were not paid—the use of this paper was to declare that I had not made any former assignment of it COURT Q What was to be done with the policy in case the bills had not been paid A He was to hold it till my death—I was to see a draft of an assignment to that effect which I never saw—it was not to be available at the office—I once called on the prisoner and he made me understand that he had paid my brother the money—that was the day the £20 was paid to Mr Chubb—he spoke very little English—he made me understand mostly by signs—his wife undertook to be the interpreter THOMAS HERDSFIELD I am an officer of the Mansion House I went to Gravesend by the Altwood steam-boat with Mr chubb—when we got there we found the prisoner in a small boat coming on board—I took him—I found on him a number of cards J M Levison No 5 Broad-street-buildings City of London and memorandums for the purpose of getting goods—he asked me what I was—I told him an officer—he then asked me was it on Mr Stephens s business —I told him Yes —that was before I had mentioned Mr Stephens—he said Very well —we had very little further conversation till we got on shore—he then said that some gentleman had persuaded him to leave his house or he should not have done it—I had not the least difficulty in understanding him—he desired I would send Mr Stephens to him and he would speak to him Cross-examined Q Did you find any papers on him showing what he was in his own country A No The following papers were here read —No 1 If W H will call at J M Levison No 5 Broad-street-buildings City to-morrow before eleven o clock or give satisfactory reference the money can be advanced to him as above —P S If not convenient the day after at two o clock No 2 I have this day received of Mr Stephens four Bills of Exchange for 40l cach bearing date this day and a Policy of Life Insurrance for 500l to advance 160l thereon which policy I am to hold as security for payment of the four bills and which bills and policy I will return to Mr Stephens by Tuesday next or the money as agreed— July 24 1835 —Witness B LEVISON J M LEVISON No 3 To the Court of Directors of the London Life Association I hereby propose to surrender Policy No 3345 to the Society at the office valuation and I declare that the same my absolute property and that the interest there on has not been passed from me by assignment mortgage bankruptcy or in any other manner No 12 Thavies-inn July 30 1835 Signed W H STEPHENS No 4 Sir —My parties

William Henry Stephens of the London Life Assurance Signed J M LEVISON W H STEPHENS I received these bills back by the twopenny post the day the prisoner was apprehended Prisoner s Defence I had nothing to do with this concern at all I know nothing about it and had nothing to do with it ISABELLA ABERNETHY I was laundress to the prisoner I could never make him understand English—I had an interpreter—most of the time he lived in Bevis Marks then at the Little Minories and then in Broad-street Buildings and was hard of hearing RICHARD ST AMOR I am an Englishman but understand Dutch I was employed to interpret some foreign documents for the prisoner in January last—I translated the and wroe answers—I should think he did not understand a word of English—he might copy an English letter if it were laid before him—I believe he was an optician JOSHUA ABRAHAMS I have known the prisoner ten or eleven weeks—it is the custom of our people when any body dies to assemble and read prayers and then one gives a lecute on how people ought to behave which Jane did—the prisoner came very close to me and said You must excuse my coming so close I am rather hard of hearing —I spoke in Hebrew and explained it in English—when I had done the prisoner said I am now as wise as before because I do not understand English —from my intercourse with him it is my opinion he cannot understand English MR CLARKSON Q What was the language in which he said he was never the wiser A In English—in German COURT Q How came you to say he said it in English A I beg you a thousand pardone I meant German JOSEPH VANDERLYN I am a tailor and came from Amsterdam I have known the prisoner ever since he has been here—I was solicited to come forward and state that he is deaf and from what I have heard of him he does not know any english Edmund Dusseldorf and Joseph Moses also gave the prisoner a good character and stated it to be their belief that he did not understand English GUILTY of uttering

Hadlow-street Burton-crescent 6th of November 1835—Messes Cox & Co pay Mrs Brown the sum of 4l 19s sterling and charge it to my account A Wedder burn Capt and Ltd Cole Coldstream Guards Messrs Cox and Co Craig s-court Charging Cross —with intent to defraud Richard Henry Cox and others against the Statute 2nd COUNT for feloniously uttering disposing and putting off a like forged order with a like intent well knowing it to be forged MR CURWOOD conducted the prosecution JAMES WILHELM PYLE I am a clerk in the house of Richard Henry Cox and two other partners army agents Craig s-court Charging Cross—they pay orders for money drawn on them by officers for whom they barre agents in the same manner as bankers pay their customers cheque On the 14th of November an order was presented purporting to be drawn by Colonel Wedder burn—I have it here—he is a Captain in the Cold stream Guards and a Colonel in the army—Cox and Co are his agents and bankers—this order was presented to me—I am perfectly acquainted with the Lieutenant-Colonel s handwriting—It is not his handwriting certainly—It is a very close imitation of it but I am able to say it is not his from my knowledge of his writing—thee is an attempt at resemblance throughout the whole draft—It all appears to be written by the same hand—It was presented to me by William Dooley a ticket porter about two o clock or son after—having discovered it to be a forgery I took instruction from one of the partners and went to the station-house and got a police-officer—I desired Dooley to remain is my office—he and the police-officer went away together Prisoner The indictment states it to be Cox and Greenwood before the Magistrate he said it was Cox and Hamilton—there is a discrepancy there Witness Charles Hammers and Henry Richard Cox are the other partners—Mr Greenwood has been dead some years—we act both as bankers and agents—we pay cheque of al amounts—some drawn on printed cheque and some on paper—a cheque on plain paper is perfectly legal if drawn in London—this is on a stamp—the number of our house is now No 2 not No 8 WILLIAM SOOLEY I am a porter at Lincoln s-inn I was in Lincoln s-inn Old-square on the 14th of November—I was waiting for a job and saw the prisoner there—he came up to me about one o clock and asked if I was there for the purpose of going on message—I said Yes —he asked me to go down to Cox and Greenwood s—I think he said Greenwood it was according to the address on the cheque and get a cheque cased—he gave me the cheque—this is it—I believe this to be the paper but it has been out of my hands ever since—I have not the least doubt of its being the paper MR PYLE I am perfectly certain that is the paper the porter gave me WILLIAM SOLEY re-examined I tendered the same paper at the Banking-house as the prisoner gave me—I remained there till the police-officer came—they paid me in the presence of the policeman and I and the policeman went away together—I went to the place he appointed to meet me at which was Mr Bagshaw s chambers in Southampton-buildings —I and the policeman went there together—I rang Mr Bagshaw s bell the policeman being on one side of the street and I on the other—he was in plain cloths—on my ringing the bell Mr Bagshaw s came to the door—I did not see the prisoner then—I went into Mr Bagshaw s clerk s room and waited there—the clerk s room looks into Southampton-building—I went to the window and saw the prisoner coming down the steps from the Mechanics Institution which is exactly opposite the window—directly I saw him coming down the steps I came out of the door into Southampton-buildings and told the policeman that was the man on the other side of the way—I went up to him just in front of him and saw his face and said I have got the money for the cheque you sent me with —I was about giving it to him when the policeman came up and took him into custody saying there was some mistake and he had better not take the money or something to that effect—the prisoner said something—I cannot say hat but he seemed very much confused and then he told the policeman I think that he could take him to the person he took it of—he then said there was no occasion for me to go with hand offered me the shilling he had agreed to give me—the policeman said I had better not take it—he and the policeman went away together—I accompanied them after going to Mr Bagshaw s and telling him—we went to Craig s-court and then to the police-station—the prisoner was locked up till seven o clock in the evening—I am quite certain he is the man—he acknowlodged that he gave it to me CHARLES OTWAY I am a policeman I accompanied Sooley on the 14th of November to Southampton-buildings and saw him in the act of tendering some money to the prisoner—I said perhaps he would refer me to the party he took it of—he said he knew nothing about it it was a mistake—I asked Sooley in his presence whether the prisoner was the man who gave him the cheque—he said he was—the prisoner said nothing to that—I told him I was an officer and he must consider himself my prisoner—he then said if I would go with him he would take me to the party he received the cheque of—I refused to go and said he must proceed with me and not I go with him—I took him to Cox and Green-wood s in a cab—on the road he asked me if I had not seen him whether I should have detained the man who presented the cheque—I told him most likely we should till we had ascertained the respectability of his character—he said O thought so I should not like to see the poor fellow or man get into trouble —he also stated that the cheque was found upon him he supposed he must suffer but he would not open his mouth to get any one else into trouble—I went in the cab with him to Cox and Company but neither of us went in—Sooley went in to inform Mr Pyle that I had apprehended the prisoner and I took him to the station-house—when the Inspector was taking the charge he asked him his address which he refused to give—he was asked from whom he received the cheque and answered From my friend Wood —when asked Wood s address he refused to give that likewise—he said I wish to give little trouble about it I don t disown being the presenter of it —I asked him if he had a pocket-book or any papers—he said no he had taken good or great care of them—I searched him but found nothing on him but 1s 6d and a knife Prisoner Q Did you speak to me first or the porter A The porter—I have no recollection of speaking to you first—you doubted my authority because I was in plain clothes—I saw a policeman in uniform and I called him thinking you might resist—you refused to go with me at first—you asked me to go to the person you took it of—you did not name Wood then or any body—I asked you in the presence of the porter where Wood lived—you refused to go with one at first over to Bagshaw s chambers—you did not struggle—I did not hold the cheque up to you and ask if it was yours—I had it in my hand and you wanted to look at it but I took care you should not seize it—In searching he was not stripped at all—I put my hand into his coat porter and waistcoat and trowser s pockets and felt his fob to see if there was any thing there and when I asked if he had a pocket he said I have taken good care of that —he had a full flap to his trowsers SAMUEL MANNERS I am a Sergeant in the Coldstream Guards I know Lieutenant-Colonel Wedderburn—on the 4th of November he was not in England—he had leave from the regiment from the 12th of July until the 11th of January—he is not in England now nor has he been since—I am very well acquainted with his handwriting—we very often have correspondence with the officers and know their writing looking at the cheque —I do not believe any part of this to be Lieutenant Colonel Wedderburn s handwriting Prisoner s Defence I have to state I received the order from another person with whom I am most intimately acquainted—he was a friend of mine till he behaved so badly to me in this instance—I received it from him in payment for a suit of clothes which he pawned of mine long ago—he had long promised me payment and paid me the day when I presented this order—there a few shillings to come to him out of it—I was to have met him and would have delivered him into a policeman s hands—I have since learned he has sailed to Spain and is on the way to join the Queen of Spain s army—I have witnesses to prove the delivery of the cheque to me and the consideration for which I received it—I have a wife and family—I ask you gentlemen who are fathers whether you could risk for 4l 19s the awful sentence of transportation for life which is a living death and a grave to all my prospects in society —does any gentleman believe that for that paltry sum I should incur this risk—the policeman can prove I said I did not know they could do any thing to me and I did not know they could touch me—I did not believe if the cheque was wrong they could do any thing but say there were no effects I delivered the cheque to the porter in Southampton-buildings which I believe is not in the parish of St Martin-in-the-fields—If I recollect right the paper is stamped—If the stamp is not legal it cannot be a legal document GUILTY of uttering Aged 35 — Transported for Life Before Mr Justice Park

utter and put off to one John Morris a counterfeit half-crown well knowing it to be counterfeited The Hon MR SCARLETT and MR ELLIS conducted the Prosecution MR CALER EDWARD POWELL I am assistant solicitor to the Mint I produce a copy of the record of the conviction of James Waltts with another for uttering counterfeit coin at Middlesex Sessions Dec 1833 I have examined it with the original record at the office of the clerk of the peace and it is correct read JOHN FISHWICH SUMMERSELL I am a turnkey of the House of Correction Coldhath-fields I am acquainted with the prisoner s person—he was convicted in January and was in my custody after his conviction JANE MORRIS I am the daughter of John Morris a publican in Sandy-row Petticoat-lane which leads out of Bishopsgate-street I know the prisoner from seeing him at our house on Monday morning the 30th of November—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—I have not a doubt of his being the person—It was about eight o clock in the morning—he came to the bar with another man—the prisoner called for two three halfpenny worth of gin and peppermint—I served him and he offered me a half-crown for which I gave him 2s 3d —he took the change and went away—my father came down stairs and was in the bar when the prisoner went away—I gave my father the half-crown—It had not been out of my hand till then JOHN MORRIS I saw the prisoner on Monday morning the 30th of November—my daughter was at the bar and sent up for some money to give change—I came down with the money and saw the prisoner and another man with him—my daughter said she wanted change for a half-crown which she gave me in the prisoner s presence—I discovered it was bad the moment the prisoner was gone and I put it on the shelf in my bar—It remained there till I gave it to the officer who afterwards took him into custody—I can positively declare I gave him the same half-crown—I know it by a mark—the prisoner came in with the same man on the Wednesday evening about five o clock—I was in the bar alone—they asked for two drops of gin—I knew them again the moment they came into the house—after serving them the prisoner tendered me half-a-crown—I looked at it and found it was good and was in the act of putting it into the till and giving him change when he said he thought he had halfpence enough to pay for it—It came to three-pence—he had some halfpence in his hand and he turned to his companion and asked him if he had got a halfpenny—his comapnion said he thought he had—he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and then replied that he had not—upon that the prisoner said Then you must give me change —he immediately put another half-crown down on the counter and the moment I took it up I discovered it was a bad one—I then turned myself sideways from the counter to go into my barparlour—I had a policeman in the parlour and was turning round to call him to take them both into custody when the one who stood next to the door seeing my motive walked out of the house—he stood close against the door—I did not see at what pace he went away—the prisoner staid at the bar—I came back with the policeman—when I was going from the counter to my bar-parlour the prisoner said Never mind about change you can give me the half-crown I have got three-pence and he put three penny-pieces on the counter—he had before asked his companion for a halfpenny—I brought the policeman round and gave him in charge and then he took the three penny pieces off the counter and put them into his pocket—I gave the half-crown to the policeman—also the one which had been passed on Monday—I took it from the shelf where I had put it EDWARD KIRBY DARLING I am a policeman I took the prisoner into custody on the 2nd of December—I saw him at the bar—I saw him take up the three-pence and put it in his left hand waistcoat pocket—I took him to the station-house and searched him but found nothing more than three penny pieces—I received two bad half-crowns from Mr Morris and have had them ever since—I marked them JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coins to the Mint These half-crowns are both counterfeit and both impressed from the same mould—they are alike in every respect—I can speak with confidence about their being from the same mould—In the letters of the word Gratis there is a defect in the mould Prisoner s Defence On Monday morning the 30th of November I was at a lady s house in Union-place Carta in-road at seven o clock and never left until nine o clock—I then accompanied the lady to Bartholomew s Hospital to see her daughter and never left her till half-past ten o clock ANN NEGUS I live in Union-place Curtain-road I am very little acquainted with the prisoner—he was at my house on Monday the 30th of November at a little after seven in the morning—he said until half-past eight o clock—I am not exactly certain that it was half-past eight o clock but he went with me to St Bartholomew s Hospital—we had to be there by nine o clock and we came out at ten o clock—It takes us half an hour to walk there—we went together—he remained there with me till a quarter past ten o clock—he walked back with me as far as White cross-street and I parted with him there—I never lost sight of him in the mean time MR SCARLETT Q How far is Petticoat-lane from your house A I suppose about a quarter of a mile—I do not know Mr Morris s at all—I went to see a friend of mine at the hospital—I was very little acquainted with the prisoner—I saw him on Sunday in the Curtain-road—he has a stable there—he said How is Mrs King —I said She is in the hospital —he said he should like to see her—I said Well I am going to-morrow morning if you like to come you can go with me but do not keep me waiting —he came to my house a little after seven o clock and breakfasted with my sons—my little girl twelve years old was there who helps to get breakfast for the family every morning—I know it was the 30th of November because I went to the hospital that morning and have not been since COURT Q Did you know when he was taken up A I did not know it till he was taken to the compter—I am not sure whether that was not on the Thursday week after and when I saw him at the Manison-house I asked him what brought him there—he said he was accused of a bad half-crown on the Monday—they had sent me word that he was taken—I went before the Lord Mayor the same day MR SCARLETT Q Did he breakfast with you A He did with my sons—I had my breakfast very early—they breakfasted at seven o clock or a few minutes after—I breakfasted before them—they breakfasted in the parlour—the kitchen is a small room not large enough for my family—I was in the room when they breakfasted—my son did not go with me to the hospital—he did not know the person I went to see—he was forced to be at work—It was Mrs King my daughter who was in the hospital COURT Q You are sure you went before the Magistrate on the Thursday week after you went to the hospital it was not the same week A I believe it was the same week—It was the Monday before he was at the Compter—It was the same week that I went before the Lord Mayor that I went to the hospital with him—I am quite sure it was not the week after—I am quite sure it was the same week MR SCARLETT Q On which side of the table did the prisoner sit at breakfast A On the right hand side—the window is on the left hand—he sat with his face towards the window—my sons sat opposite each other—I am quite sure my sons went no part of the way towards the hospital COURT Q Had you any gin and water that morning A Nothing at all—I am not in the habit of drinking gin or gin and water—the prisoner did not have any to my knowledge—I staid at the hospital an hour—they do not let us in till nine o clock and then we are out about ten o clock—there is only an hour allowed—the prisoner staid with me the whole time—my son is too frightened to come here—he said he should never go out alive if he came HENRY NEGUS The prisoner was at my father s and mother s house on the 30th of November and he breakfasted with me and my brother and mother—he came at seven o clock or a little after—I had seen him two or three times before at my mother s house—he never breakfasted at our house before—I do not know how long he staid at breakfast—I do not know at what time he went away—I had to go out with a cab at half-past seven o clock—I left my brother there—he is out now with a cab—that is all I know—we are both cab drivers—I believe he came that morning to go to see my sister at the hospital—he knew my sister before MR ELLIS Q How many of you were there at breakfast A Me my brother sister and mother—I am quite sure all four were there—my mother breakfasted with us—I am quite sure of that my mother had toast and tea and bread and butter for breakfast—we all sat down to breakfast together—we were all sitting down to breakfast when the prisoner came in—the prisoner sat on the right hand side of the room when he came in—the window is on the left hand side—I sat close to the window—I know it was on the 30th of November for I was told so by my mother on the morning as I asked about the day of the month—I asked her what the day of the month was about three o clock in the afternoon when I came in to change horses—I ask the day of the month almost every day I go out in case any body might dupe me—I know the 30th was the

t18360104-340  340 HENRY WHEELER was indicted for feloniously knowingly and without lawful excuse having in his possession 38 pieces of paper each having thereon the impression of a false forged and counterfeit die resembling a die which had been used by and under the direction of the Commissioners of Stamps and Taxes denoting a certain stamp-duty charged and imposed by 9 Geo IV —19 other COUNTS varying the manner of laying the charge MR ATTORNEY GENERAL with MR PHILLIPS conducted the Prosecution JAMES ELLIS I am an officer of the police On Tuesday the 15th of December I went to No 122 St John-street with a warrant—Stowell accompanied me he belongs to the Stamp Office and Mace a police-officer—there is a private door to the house with a brass-plate on the door on which was engraved H Wheeler Card-manufacturer —there is a shop door with H Wheeler Card-manufacturer and Printer on each side—I went in with my companions at the shop door—I asked for Mr Wheeler—I went down stairs into a cellar-kitchen and there saw the prisoner—I asked him who he was—he said his name was Wheeler—I asked if he was master of the house—he said Yes —I told him I had got a warrant to search his house for a forged ace of spades—I do not exactly recollect what he said but he requested I would let him look at the warrant—I read it over to him with the exception of the name of the informat—he made no particular observation at that time and I went up stairs—he afterwards said some person had done it laid the information out of spite or something to that effect—I left him and his wife two sons and daughter in charge of Mace and went up stairs with Stowell—we just took a cursory view of the different rooms and I returned back and found the prisoner in the cellar—I had left him in the kitchen—I told him I must go and search the house having searched the shop in his presence—I told him I would go up to the top of the house to begin—he said You had better begin at the bottom or something to that effect but we went to the top—I went first into the attic which was partly divided into two but part of the partition was down—in the back part of the attic I went through a trap-door into the roof part and there found a quantity of playing-cards some loose and some in packages—unfortunately after taking the prisoner away all the cards I found got mixed—I handed the cards I found there down to Stowell—the prisoner was present—I then went into the front part of the attic and found a hole in the ceiling through which I got into the roof of that part there being no other way to do so—I there found a quantity of cards—there might be ten or twelve packs—I also found this bag—it is in the same state as I found it—I gave the second parcel of cards to Stowell and dropped the bag down to him also—I examined it opens it —I found in it these papers—I believe they are all the same—there are thirty-four sheets with ten impressions of the ace of spades on each sheet—being three hundred and forty impressions—I also found in the bag thirty-eight impressions loose—I tied them up together and am sure these are the same—they are in a state to put on cards—some of them are pasted on cards—I then sent for a coach and took the prisoner into custody—I searched the house afterwards and found a great quantity of cards and materials for making cards—there were a great many more packs of cards in the bag consisting of fifty-one cards each—those wanted the ace of spades—they were loose in the bag—I also found this parcel which contains ninety-nine aces of spades some on cards and some on papers—here are thirty-seven aces of spades without the stamp—they were in the bag—I also found some blank cards some old spade aces some stamped and some not—these were in the bag—I found a great quantity of papers and cards in various parts of the house—in nearly every room—here are the materials for making them which I found—here is a block for printing with the knaves and kings and queens and other materials for card printing—here are some cards in the process of manufacturer not finished—altogether there are one hundred and eighty packs wanting the ace of spades JOHN STOWELL I am an officer of the Stamp Duties I accompanied Ellis to search the prisoner s house on Tuesday the 15th of December—I went up stairs with him and Ellis—I heard Ellis read the warrant to him before we went up stairs—Ellis searched the loft and handed down ten or twelve packs of cards to me some in papers and some loose—he then went to the front part of the attic got up a broken place between the plaster and handed me down more cards and a bag—I opened it and found some cards which I have marked—the bag contained the things now produced—the other cards which Ellis has produced were found in the house RICHARD GODWIN MACE I have heard the two witnesses evidence—they have stated correctly what took place in my presence—I found a plate JOHN ELLIS re-examined I marked the date on which I went on the back of this card—it was on the 15th—Mr Harris has seen the aces of spades found in the bag JOSEPH HARRIS I am deputy-supervisor of stamps in the stamp department at Somerset House Looking at the thirty-eight impressions of the ace of spades these are forged—the circle round the garter is very different the genuine one being engine-turned—it is the custom of card manufacturers to send paper to the Stamp Officer for the ace of spades to be stamped—the Commissioners provide a stamp for that purpose—they send plain paper to us in reams—the Commissioners sometimes provide a stamp with the manufacturer s name on it at his request—there was such a plate provided for a manufacturer named Thomas Creswick—there is a book kept at the Stamp Office with impressions of the plates which are prepared—I have it here—it has impressions of the plates prepared for Creswick—the date is on the impression 14th of June 1828 —these aces of spades appear to be a forgery of that plate—the other aces found in the bag are all forgeries of other plates of other manufacturers Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q In 1828 what was the duty payable on playing-cards A Up to 1828 it was 1s 6d on the ace of spades 6d on the wrapper and 6d on the label Q The card you call a forgery appears in no respect a resemblance of Creswick s plate A It is very bad—it would certainly not deceive any body in the Stamp Office nor any body else who examined it I should think—there is a great variation between the lion and unicorn and the crown and in the ring encircling the motto—I have reason to believe all the cards produced are forgeries—Creswick is still a card-manufacturer—this old ace of spades is a genuine one—some of these old ones I have not seen before—I am not able to judge whether these are genuine or not not having seen them before—I believe them to be forged but I am not positive—this one I am sure is a genuine one—it is a very old ace which was used previous to my coming into the Office—here is one genuine and one which I have no knowledge of—the rest are blanks—the one with Creswick on it is genuine—this other pack is also a stamp used before I came into the office and I cannot speak positively about them—I never saw Thomas Wheeler—there was a person of that name a licensed card-manufacturer—that was not the prisoner—I do not know whether he is alive or dead—in 1828 when the stamp-duty was altered the impression of the aces of spades was also altered—I was in the Stamp Office at that time Q At that time do you know that the Stamp Office had a great deal of card-paper with the duties on it of the time before the alteration took place A No I do not know that nor that they sold it as wastepaper—the genuine paper would be in the custody of the warehousekeeper of cards and dies—he has no perquisites that I am aware of respecting cards and paper—I have no access to the warehouse and I do not know whether things are sold or not—there is only one warehouse—Lewis Legue is the keeper—I am not quite certain whether he was so before 1828—I do not think that Thomas Wheeler was a licensed manufacturer of cards after 1828 no plate being provided for him but I cannot be positive MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Was a new die for the aces provided in 1828 after the passing of the Act of Parliment A there was—if varied considerably from the old die—this plate for Creswick was according to the new die—those bearing the name of T Wheeler I have compared with the specimen-book—I did not compare those two which the prisoner counsel showed me CHARLES PRESSWICK I am secretary to the Board of Stamps at Somerset House On the delivery of the new plate of the ace of spades engraved for the Board I take it to the stamping room and take an impression of it in a book for that purpose—here is the book—in June 1828 the ace of spades impression was changed—I saw the new impression made in the book and this is the impression taken at the time—this is an impression from the genuine plate—I apprehend this plate has been used for Creswick since 1828—these thirty-eight impressions are forged Cross-examined Q What sort of forgeries should you call them A They are imitation of the plate no doubt—they resemble it in some measure—they vary considerably on being compared—any card-maker would perceive the variation COURT Q Not every card-player A I should apprehend not MR CLARKSON Q Can you undertake to say whether these cards have ever been played with A Some of them certainly not for they are not pasted but on paper only—there was a wheeler a licensed card-manufacturer and I think his initial was T but I cannot say whether it was Thomas—I do not know whether the prisoner is a licensed card-maker—I do not think there is now any registered card-maker named Wheeler Q There was an alteration in the duty in 1828 can you tell whether at that time there remained a stock in hand of card-paper of the duties then payable A Not of the ace of spades certainly—if any was unconsumed it would be cancelled—they have not been sold for waste-paper MR PHILLIPS Q Is it the custom in making cards to paste this paper over the thick card to finish it A Certainly MR CLARKSON Q Can you recollect whether a person named Russell did not buy some thousands of old aces of spades A I have no knowledge of that—I cannot imagine how such a thing could have occured—I have no knowledge or belief such a thing could be done—the stamps for the ace of spades only vary reference to the name of the card-maker COURT Q You have a stamp denoting the duty and if a manufacturer takes a certain quantity of stamps and wishes his name impressed on them in addition to the ordinary stamp you impress his name A Plates are provided for every card-maker with the name—it is the same impression except the name EDMUND GREGORY I am landlord of the house No 122 St John-street Smithfield—it is in the country of Middlesex—it is not in London middle of the year 1833—he has occupied it as my tenant ever since—I do not know who was in possession of it before as it was empty at the time I came into possession of it—the lease was surrendered to me Cross-examined Q Did you ever see Martin Morillia there A I never heard the name—I do not know Thomas Wheeler—I have only seen the prisoner when I called there for rent Prisoner s Defence I am not guilty CHARLES BOURNE BRIND I am a grocer and oilman and live at No 28 Old change I have lately dealt considerably in waste-paper—I had a quantity from Somerset House last July and August and among it was a ream of foolscap paper with the stamp of the ace of spades on it—I have not got any of it with me—I believe it was sold with other paper COURT Q Do you recollect what duty was marked on them A No I did not take notice MR CLARKSON Q Were they such as these Part of the 38 A Yes COURT Q You cannot tell what was the duty—what do you mean by their being such as those A It was the ace of spades MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Look at this should you take that for a stamp of the ace of spades A Yes—I bought the paper myself at Somerset House—I think I bought about eight ton of paper—it was advertised as waste paper—I should think the ream of aces of spades would weight fifteen or sixteen lbs—there was newspapers and waste paper of different descriptions in the eight ton—I cannot tell whether there was any name on the aces of spades—they were sold to a great many parties—I think one Elliot bought 4 cwt of the paper in September and he had them Alfred Knight a stationer if Basing-lane and Thomas Wilson a stationer of Cheapside gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 37 — Transported for Life

before that A No he left me on the 7th of December—he was with us from June to december JOHN PARKER I am a publican and live next door to the last witness He brought this note to me in September last

bar—I did not know that I should know him but if I was to see him with the same white hat on as he had before I might know him—I know him now by his good complexion with rather a swallow skin—I never saw him without a hat—he came three times once when he came to inquire for the letters and twice when he came for them but did not stop a minute and I believe I was busy—the last time the boy came—it

varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS BODKIN and LEE conducted the Prosecution ROBERT MILNER I am in partnership with James Bailey at No 17 St Paul s Church-yard On the 25th of April I remember a female coming into our shop—I believe the prisoner to be the person—she purchased some trifling articles—I cannot tell to what amount—she then spoke to my young man—she asked me if I would accommodate her with a cheque for eight sovereign to send into the country to a friend—we kept a banking account wish Messrs Hankey at that time looking at the cheque —this is the cheque I gave her for 8l—I see the letter y here—that was not put there by me nor the 0 in the margin—I drew it for 8l only—she gave me eight sovereigns for it—I received an account of this cheque it may be three or four days afterwards from Messrs Hankey in consequence of which I requested to see it—when I gave her the cheque she gave me her address Mrs Hutchinson No 1 Connaught-terrace Edgeware-road Paddington —this is the memorandum I made at the time—I have not been to ascertain whether any such person lived there Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you take down the address at the time A Yes in the margin of my cheque-book which I have in my hand—ours is a house of extensive business—I suppose there might he fifty ladies in the shop at the same time—when I first saw the prisoner my impression was that she was not the person but after I heard her speak I said she was—I have not the least doubt in my own mind that she is the same person but I do not swear it positively MR LEE Q When you first saw her and thought she was not the same person was she dressed the same as the person you gave the cheque to A Altogether different—she had not spoken when I said that—I heard her speak about a quarter of an hour afterwards and from her voice it was my opinion she was the same person—I did not give a cheque of that amount to any other lady in exchange for sovereigns—to the best of my recollection I had not given a cheque for 8l to any body that day but we give a great many cheques in a day JOHN LENT I am cashier in the house of William Alers Hankey and Co —he has more than one partner—in April last Milner and Bailey had an account at our house—on the 25th of April I attended at the counter and paid this cheque—I think it was about two o clock in the day—it was between two

1836—it was a cheque for 80l when I paid it—it had the appearance of having been recently written—I can now evidently trace that the y has been added—the 0 is not so evident—my impression is that the prisoner is the person to whom I paid the money—I am certain it was a female—she wrote on the back of the cheque Mrs Hutchinson No 1 Connaught-terrace Edgeware-road as her address at my request—as soon as Messrs Bailey made inquiry about the cheque I inquired into there address and no such person was known—I believe this was within a week—no such person had ever lived there—a communication was made of this circumstance by our house to Mr Howell of Gracechurch-street Cross-examined Q Did you take particular notice of the person presenting the cheque A I did rather so—I cannot swear positively to the prisoner JOHN CHAMBERLIN I am shopman to Messrs Howell of Grace-church-street On the 25th of April the prisoner came to our shop between four and five o clock and purchased goods to the amount of 7l 18s —a challi dress was among the articles—I received a £20 note in payment—this is the note I received from the prisoner No 6682 dated March 25 1836 —she gave her address as Mrs Hutchinson No 1 Connaught-terrace Regent s park—I wrote that address on the back of the note at the time—between the 25th of April and the 24th of May a communication was made to us by Messrs Hankey with regard to that note—the prisoner came again on the 24th of May—she then had on the challi dress which she had purchased of me—I recognized her when she came into the shop—she asked Sellers one of our shopman to oblige her with a cheque for 8l to remit it into the country for she could not obtain a bank post-bill for less than 10l —I had made a communication to Sellers between this conversation and her entering the shop HUMPHREY WILLIAM SELLERS I am in the employ of Howell and Co linen-drapers in Gracechurch-street I remember on the 25th of April the prisoner making some purchases at the shop—I have not the least doubt of her—she bought goods amounting to 7l 19s and paid a £30 note for them—on the 24th of May I saw her enter the shop and recognized her as the person who had been there before—I had not the least hesitation about it—she spoke to me and complained of the challi dress she had on that the dress-maker had spoiled it in making—she alluded to it as what she had bought at our shop—she then bought a pair of gloves and wished to look at some challis which she had seen the time before when she was at our house and while looking at them she asked me if I could tell her how she could get a cheque on some banker for 8l as she wished to send some money into the country and she had applied to the Bank of England and they would not give her a bank post-bill for less than 10—having heard of the transaction at Bailey s house before this I sent for an officer and she was taken into custody JOSEPH SAVAGE I am teller at the Bank of England On the 25th of April these two £20 notes were paid into the bank No 6683 dated March 25 1836 and No 7763 dated March 29 1836—I cannot say whether they were presented by a male or female—the person wrote their address Mrs Hutchinson No 1 Connaught-terrace Regent s-park —I paid it in gold ELIZABETH JACOBS I live at No 1 Connaught-terrace Edgeware-road Paddington I have lived there seven years last March—during that time the prisoner never had anything to do at our house nor any body named Hutchinson—we have no lodger—the prisoner is an utter stranger Cross-examined Q Do you know who lives at No 2 A A tailor—it has been all one house—there is only one No 1 SARAH MACRAE In May last I was in the prisoner s service—she came after me at the latter end of April—she was then living at Wood-land-cottage Woodland-grove Grove-lane Camberwell—she lived there alone by the name of Smith—here is her address written by herself—she never passed by the name of Hutchinson while I lived with her RICHARD BAYS I live in

Smith—I never heard the name of Hutchinson—she came home on the 25th of April at about seven o clock in the evening and requested to have my bill—I gave it to her—she then gave me two sovereigns to pay me—I saw her turn a long purse with what I suppose to be about forty sovereigns and some notes rolled up together—she said she had been into the City to receive her dividend CHARLES SLOW I am

t18360613-1593  1593 FREDERICK HAWKES NOTTIDGE was indicated for feloniously forging on the 23rd of May an order for the payment of £2 with intent to defraud Caroline Jeffrey—2nd COUNT for uttering the same with the like intent—2 other COUNTS stating the intent to be to defraud Felix Calvert Ladbroke and others CAROLINE JEFFERY I live in Duke-street St James s I knew the prisoner—he gave me the name of Hawkes Nottidge when I first saw him—I saw him on Monday the 23rd of May—I had seen him three weeks before when he called at my house to look at my apartment—on the 23rd of May he asked me to allow him to go into a room to wait because he had appointed to meet a person at my house from Ludgate-hill who was to brings a gold watch and chain at two o clockhe then said he had come out in the morning with only 5l of him and he had no more money left in his who had borrowed this 5l of him and he had no more money left in his pocket—that his young friend had promised to let him have it again in half an hour but he had spent it at a gambling house and h had no time to go into the City to get any more money from the bank that day—he asked me for pen ink and paper which I gave him and then he asked me if I would allow my servant to go into the neighbourhood to get a cheque cashed for him for £2 allowed her to go—he drew the cheque for £2 looking at it that is it—I known it because it is the same date—it appears to be the same that h drew—I left it with the Magistrate when I was examined my servant took out the cheque—I read it before she took it—he handed it tome and I gave it to my servant—she took it to Mr Blockey a wine merchant—She returned in about five minutes and brought two sovereigns which I gave to the prisoner—he then wrote another cheque for £20 looking at one this is it—he gave it to me and begged me to pay it away for the gold watch and chain when the person brought them from Ludgate-hill as he had not time to stay and he would call the following morning for it and I was to take a receipt—he then gave me his address Fendall s Hotel Palace-yard Westminster —that was in own writing—this is the paper looking at one —his name is Hawkes Nottidge Calvert on this paper—he wrote that—the man did not call with the watch and the cheque was never paid away—I went to Fendall s Hotel in the evening having suspicion and made inquiries—they did not know any such person as the prisoner there but they knew the name—they had letters which they had taken in for him—I went to the bankers next morning Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When he called on you before he told you his name was Nottidge A He had told me in words that his name was Nottidge but I had almost forgotten it—I have lost 2l by the transaction—his father certainly came and offered me the money and pressed me to take it—I have not got it—I refused the money—he wished me to give a letter in to the Magistrate—the foreman or his master Mr Nottidge has got the money—I did receive it—he forced it on me COURT Q Who did A Mr Nottidge the father MR CLARKSON Q Before it was forced on you and after you had made the inquiries you mention did you ask the prisoner for the that 2l A I saw the account of the prisoner being confined and I went to Tothill-fields with a friend and saw him—I said if he would pay me the 2l I had no wish to proceed against him—I did not say I was convinced he did not mean to defraud me nor any thing of the sort—I did not know whether it was a forgery or anything of the sort—I thought it would be a great trouble to prosecute him—he said his father would pay me the two sovereigns—I went there because I wished to get the money—I never said I did not belive he intended to defraud me—it must have been his intent to defraud or he would not have drawn the cheque—I swear to the best of my knowledge that I did not say so—I never told him any thing of the sort—I did not say I was sure he did not intend to wrong me or any thing of that sort—it is clear he did it to get the 2l —he asked me to sent the cheque into the neighbourhood to get change—he told me his father would pay and I went to his father to get the two sovereigns—I did not see him—I saw his wife—it was at No 225 I think Blackfriars-road—I saw a person named Harding there Q Did you tell Harding you were sure the prisoner did not mean to defraud you A No I did not or any thing to that effect—I am quite sure of that I said if the father paid the money I did not wish to proceed against him—I had no wish to appear against him—that was after what I had read in the paper—I did not see the father and did not get the 2l —I did not call again—I said if the two sovereigns were sent to me I should not appear on the Tuesday following—I said that at the father s—it was on Saturday—I do not know the day of the month—I had not lodged any complaint against the prisoner then—I left my address with Mr Harding and the mother and not hearing I went before the Justice Q Would you have gone before the Magistrate on Tuesday if you had got your 2l A Certainly not—the 2l was forced upon me the last time that he was brought before the Magistrate at Bow-street which was last Tuesday week I think—it was Saturday week that the father came to my house do offer the 2l —I appeared twice before the Magistrate before the father came—I did not sent any intimation to the father that I desired to have the 2l between the first and second times that I went before the Magistrate—he came to my house on the Saturday week offering it to me if I would give a note addressing the Magistrate and requesting to have the cheque back again that I might give them to Mr Nottidge as a receipt for the two sovereigns Q Did you when the father called on the Saturday week ask him for part of the money A No I asked nobody for part of the money—I told Mr Nottidge I could not think of giving him any writing to the Magistrate but I had no objection to go to my solicitor to ask whether I should do wrong in receiving the two sovereigns—I promised to meet him outside the solicitor s door—I told him my solicitor said he thought I should not do wrong in talking the two sovereigns—the solicitor was not present—Mr Nottidge then wished me to go to his solicitor—in consequence of what my solicitor told me I received that two sovereigns for half an hour I think—I received them into my hand—he forced them into my hand COURT Q What do you call forcing it A After consulting my solicitor I said I had no wish to take the two sovereigns as I was fearful of doing wrong—my solicitor said I might receive it but he said I should go to the Magistrate and tell him what I had done—he forced it—I afterwards considered of it and thought I had better not take it—I received it into my hand MR CLARKSON Q That is what you called being forced on you A Yes—I said I was obliged to proceed and the two sovereigns were to be taken back again—we separated very shorty after and I went home—this happened in the street—I went to call on Mr Blockey and he went to the Magistrate s office with me—I had got the money with me in my glove—I put it there—it was not forced into my glove—Mr Nottidge pressed me to take it and put it into my hand—I do not think I put my hand out to take it Q As far as you were concerned did you not intend to abandon all prosecution against the prisoner A Yes if I could do so without any injury—it was partly out of felling for the father and partly because I wished my money back—I did not ask the prisoner for 5s at Tothill-fields nor for any part—I said if he paid me the whole I would not appear against him—I was not to part with the £20 cheque unless the man brought the watch and chain—nobody came and I did not part with it—before I saw the Magistrate I went in pursuit of the father to give the money back again as I thought I had better not take it—the father refused it and I gave it to his clerk—I then went and told the Magistrate what I had done COURT Q When was the prisoner apprehended A I do not know the day of the month—he did not mention what shop the watch was to come from—he said from Ludgate-hill—I was at home all day until eight o clock in the evening when I went I went to Fendall s Hotel—he gave me the cheque about three o clock—before that time I can undertake to say nobody called—there is no watchmaker from Ludgate-hill here GEORGE BLOCKEY I am a wine-merchant and live in Duke-street St James s I believe this to be the cheque that was presented to me by Miss Jeffery s servant—I paid the cheque to Cox and Biddulphs my bankers that day—I only received one cheque of that description—I believe this to be the same—I did not read it to notice that there was no payee except the bearer—I had no suspicion of it—I should not have cashed it without knowing the parties—I did not write on it at all—there is Lordbroke written across it but I did not do that—my name is written across the back of it—I think that was done by my bankers JAMES HARDING I live in Penton-place Kennington and am clerk to Felix Calvert Ladbroke and Co bankers in Bank-buildings On the 24th of May the draft now produced was presented at their house—it purports to be signed H Calvert —no such person banks at our house—the prisoner had no account there—the clerk of Messrs Cox and Co presented the draft—I believe he is not here—I do not know the hand-writing of the draft—I wrote on it Do not know on whose account drawn —the £20 cheque was presented at the same time JOHN HARDING I am a surveyor and live in Exmouth-place Commercial-road East I have known the prisoner about nine months and his family—he went by the name of Frederick Hawkes Nottidge—he was called so in his family—his father s name is George Nottidge—I never knew the prisoner bear any other name—I know his hand-writing—I believe this £2 draft and this direction looking at them to be his handwriting—I am perfectly acquainted with it Cross-examined Q Have You never known him go by the name of Calvert A Never—I was present when Miss Jeffery came to his father s house for the purpose of getting her money—I heard her state three or four times that she was convinced the prisoner had no intention to defraud her—the prisoner is respectably connected COURT Q What did she state three or four times A That she did not believe the prisoner had any intention of defrauding her of the money or words to that effect—she was speaking of the £2 draft—the other was produced MR CLARKSON to MISS JEFFERY Q Did you ever say you did not believe the prisoner intended to defraud you of the £2 A I never said so—I had a witness with me at the time who I think if he was sent for would prove I did not say so COURT Q Was any thing said about the £20 A No—that was not given with intent to defraud me—I am not positive whether I expressed any opinion of that—I cannot say what passed about the £20—the £20 was mentioned and I think I might have said that was not given with any intention to defraud me—It was merely given me that I might have no suspicion about the £2—I thought it was merely given me as a colour not with any intention to defraud any one—I said no man called and I believed no man would call with the watch—I thought it was not meant to be circulated—I never said there was no intention to defraud me by the £2 cheque JOHN HARDING re-examined Q Was it in reference to the cheque of £2 she said she believed the prisoner had no intention to defraud her A With regard to the £2 and not the other I am positive of it COURT Q Her observation was she believed his intention was not to defraud her A Of the £2—the words were specifically used in one instance of the £2 —to the best of my recollection her first statement was she had come on unpleasant business with regard to Mr Nottidge s son—that he had drawn a cheque on her for £2 requesting her to get the cash of some person in the neighbourhood—she said she sent out to a neighbour by her servant and got the money—that the prisoner stated his reasons for wanting the £2 was that he had brought out a £5 note is his pocket which he had lent to a friend who had lost it in a gaming-house—that he had not time to go into the City to get more and he wished her to lend him £2 or get £2 for him—he wanted it expressly for immediate use that evening—that she got the £2 from Mr Blockey handed the money to the prisoner and he left her the draft which she then produced of £20 stating he expected a person to call with a gold watch chain and seals and if it came to take the watch for him and take a receipt—but she did not think he had any intention of tricking her out of the £2 for she believed him too respectable at the time to do any thing of the kind—that she did not believe even now that he meant to cheat her of the money—that she did been to Tothill-fields and had seen him that he had given her an order for his father to pay the money which she produced and if his father would pay the money she had no wish to take any further steps—I replied that I did not believe his father would do any thing of the kind—she said well she would leave it for the present if the money was sent to her either on or before Tuesday she would not proceed and three or four times over she said she could not think he meant to cheat her out of the money—the money has since been handed to me CAROLINE JEFFERY re-examined Q You have heard that gentleman s evidence—he had gone through the details of the conversation and says you stated three or four time over you could not think he meant to cheat you of the money A I never mentioned the words—I positively deny using a word of that sort about the £2 cheque—Mr Lamb an opposite neighbour was with me—I am positive he would remember the circumstance and what I said Draft read CHARLES SHAW I am head waiter at Fendall s hotel Palace-yard Westminster I know the prisoner by sight—I saw him first about five or six weeks from the time of my examination—he made several calls at our hotel—he inquired if a note or letter was left there for a gentleman of the name of Nottidge—I introduced him to the bar and he received a letter so addressed—I never knew him by any name except Nottidge—he asked for the letters of that name and said they were for himself—he never lodged at the hotel or took any refreshment there but one glass of wine to my knowledge JOHN SUMNER police-constable F 137 The prisoner was given into my charge in Little Queen-street by a gentleman named Osmond who keeps a Coffee-house in the Strand—I have produced the two cheques and the address here—I received them from Miss Jeffery—they are the same she produced to the Magistrate MISS JEFFERY re-examined Mr Blockey returned the £2 draft to me again and I paid him the two sovereigns—I merely sent the £20 draft to the bankers by a neighbour and it was returned to me again—it was the same as I sent—I retained the address in my own possession MR BLOCKEY re-examined I received the draft back from our bankers and gave it to her—I believe it to be the same JAMES HARDING re-examined The cheque produced is the same as was produced at our house it has my writing on it ELIZABETH HARVEY I was servant to the prosecutrix I took this draft to Mr Blockey s—I was not present when my mistress had it from the prisoner Cross-examined Q Were you present at any time when the prisoner s father was there A No—I never heard her say she did not believe the prisoner intended to cheat her of the £2 Thomas Lunn chemist Aldersgate-street Hugh Jones Westmore-land-buildings Aldersgate-street Samuel

—2nd COUNT for uttering disposing of and putting off the same with a like intent Other COUNTS stating his intent to be to defraud Henry Dalton MICHAEL HENRY HART I am a clothier and live in Ratcliff-highway On the 25th of July I went out and when I returned I understood an advance note had been offered at my shop—when I was at home in the afternoon the prisoner came in and said I have now come Mr Hart and have brought a friend with me who knows me he told me he had an order from Captain Bull of the Tobago for a month s advance and that he had brought a friend with him who was to be responsible that the order was correct—Mr Dalton was the person—I did not know him before—I consented to take the note—he took 2l 6s in clothes and I gave him 1l 4s in money and he went away—I sent my young man with them with the goods to Mr Dalton s to see that it was correct—I gave my young man the goods and money—he is not here—I gave the note to Evans the officer HENRY DALTON I knew the prisoner about ten months ago—he applied to me in July to accompany him to Mr Hart s to say that he was respectably connected—I had heard that he was so but I certainly never knew any of his friends—I understood he was highly respectable—he showed me shipping order for 3l 10s and said he had received it from the Tobago Captain Bull commander and asked me to go down to Hart s—I asked him why he could not go to some other friend—he said his friend was too far and he must sail next morning to the West Indies in the Tobago—I went with him and the goods and money were advanced on my responsibility—the man brought the clothes and money to my house and delivered them to the prisoner in my house and he took them away with him—the man gave the money and goods into his hands Prisoner Q Have you not entered into an arrangement with Mr Hart to pay him 10s every fortnight Witness A I have—that was after you were taken—I did not receive 5s from you when the goods were brought to my house—you offered it to me and I told you to keep it for the sailors for grog—you told me you wrote the note yourself—I do not recollect telling a person that I had entered into am arrangement with you and the thing was settled—I said you had offered to arrange the matter—I said it was likely to be settled—I was partly persuaded to prosecute and did it partly for my own sake afterwards THOMAS BULL I am not a seaman now—I have been to sea many years but not lately—the prisoner resided at my house with his father for about two or three months —I have a brother named Richard he is captain of the Tobago—she in the West India trade—I know my brother s handwriting well—one evening the prisoner said he was desirous of going to sea—I said my brother had just returned and he might want an officer and I would ask the question—I told him that he commanded the Tobago—that was probably a week before the transaction in question—none of this looking at the note is my brother Richard s handwriting—not a letter of it I am sure—I have seen the prisoner write once of twice—the filling up of the note is so different to his signature at the back that I cannot positively swear it is his writing but I believe the whole of it is his handwriting—it is disguised but by closely scrutinizing if you will see there is an analogy—I believe it is his writing JAMES CHRISTOPHER EVANS I received this note from Mr Hart and have had it ever since—I took the prisoner in charge at Mr Bull s house on Monday morning the 1st of August—I told him it was about the advance note—Mr Dalton was with me at the time—he said I suppose what it is about and he said to Dalton I did not think you would have brought it to this Mr Dalton I thought you promised you would settle it in another way — not read £3

72 Cornhill Prisoner s Defence On Monday the 25th of July 1 went to Mr Dalton and requested him as my friend to go with me to be answerable for a bill or advance note and it was on his responsibility and indorsement that Mr Hart cashed it—two days after Dalton charged me before the police-inspector with forging the note and the case was dismissed as he could not make the charge good against me—as soon as I was discharged I offered to arrange the matter with Dalton—he said he did not wish to hurt me and would do all in his power to serve me that I had nothing to fear all should be settled amicably—of the money I received I gave Dalton 5s and paid for some refreshment—we met by agreement twice and it was not till the following Monday that I was taken a second time—I did not tell him I wrote the bill myself but he tried to obtain the acknowledgement from me—I have since had abundant reasons to believe that his friendly professions were merely to gain time to bring his plans and charges against me to maturity—far from wishing to defraud Hart or Dalton my intention was when I discovered the note to be a forgery to transfer my wages over to Mr Dalton as soon as I got a ship which I expected to do in a day or two and which happened the day I was arrested the second time GUILTY Aged 19 — Transported For Life Before Mr Baron Gurney

prisoner came to my shop and asked if Mr Beach was at house—I said Yes he is my name is Beach —he then handed me this note—it was folded but had no seal or wafer—I read the note—he said it came from Mr Harris—I turned the leaf over thinking the cheque might be on the other side but I found no cheque there reads — 60 Fenchurch-street 15th October 1836—Dear Sir I have just purchased a horse of the bearer it is too late for him to get the cheque cashed at my banker s—if you will do it or get it done for him you will oblige yours Charles Harris —I asked the prisoner if he had the cheque with him—he said yes he had but he did not produce it—I then said to him I was very sorry but I could not accommodate Mr Harris at that moment having paid my cash in to my banker s and all that I had in the house in the shape of money was a cheque for 100l 15s and a few sovereigns— Mr Harris is a medical man and has attended my family for some time —the prisoner asked me if I would write Mr Harris a note to that effect—I I did so and handed it to the prisoner—at that time I had no suspicion of it being a forgery—I was not acquainted with Mr Harris s hand-writing—as the prisoner was going out he said It is of no consequence I am going to Gravesend in the morning but it will detain me a few hours —the next morning would be Sunday—that observation caused me to suspect something was wrong and I gave my shop-boy William king directions to follow the prisoner—the boy soon returned and in consequence of what he said I immediately called on Mr Harris but he was not at home—when I did see him I communicated what had taken place and showed him the note—on the Monday morning at about eleven o clock I was sent for by Mr Harris—when I got there I saw the prisoner and said That is the man that presented the note to me on Saturday morning —I am not aware that the prisoner made any reply—I have not the least doubt of his being the same man Prisoner I was not alluding to myself when I said I was going to Gravesend but that my master was the person—Mr Harris who sent me said he was going to Gravesend in the morning previous to sending me Witness I am certain he spoke of himself—he said It is of no consequence I am going to Gravesend but it will detain me WILLIAM KING I am thirteen years old and am in Mr Beach s employ I remember the prisoner coming to the shop—after he left I followed him by my master s order—he went up Leadenhall-market and there I lost him in the crowd—he took a direction away from Mr Harris s house which is in Fenchurch-street CHARLES HARRIS I am surgeon living in Fenchurch-street On the Saturday evening in question finding Mr Beach had called on me I immediately went to him—in consequence of what I learnt from him I went on Monday morning to Esdaile and Co my bankers and gave directions to Mr Goodman the cashier and about eleven o clock that morning the prisoner was brought to my house in custody by Mr Twigg a cashier at Esdaile s and this cheque was produced—I immediately declared it to be a forgery—I then sent for Mr Beach—neither the note nor cheque are my writing nor any part of either of them—I had no knowledge whatever either of one or the other—I kept a cash-account at Esdaile s COURT Q Was the name on the cheque or any of the cheque or note written by your direction A Certainly not—nobody brought me a note from Mr Beach Purporting to

made to our house by Mr Harris —I informed the prisoner he must accompany me to Mr Harris the drawer of the draft—he did not offer any opposition—he accompanied me—I took him by the arm but not to use any violence—we went towards Fenchurch-street—our banking-house is in Lombard-street—we went in a direction away from Smithfield—after going some distance the prisoner said I hope you will not detain me long for the coach leaves town in five minutes and I am going by it —I expressed my regret but said he must accompany me—in Fenchurch-street he said Had we not better return to Smithfield that I may endeavour to find out the person who gave me the draft —that was the first time I heard him mention Smithfield—I said no that he must first go to Mr Harris—when near a public-house he said Will you come in and take some refreshment —I thanked him and told him I supposed he stood in need of some refreshment from being at Smith field-marker so early as five o clock as he had stated but I declined it—nothing more passed till we got to Mr Harris s—on arriving there I presented the cheque and it was declared to be a forgery in the prisoner s presence—Mr Beach was not there at that time—down to that time he had not mentioned Mr Beach s name at all or having been there on Saturday—I quitted before Mr Beach arrived and left him in custody of an officer—Mr Harris said to him I think you are the person or fellow who presented a letter to Mr Beach and he said he was not Prisoner I deny saying I was going by coach—I said there was a person going by coach in five minutes whom I wanted to see and I was to return to you in five minutes Witness That is not so—I had not hold of his arm the whole of the way but had repeatedly that he might be kept close to me—I laid hold of his arm in crossing the road as he stopped short for a coach to divide us but I held him the harder—I held him by the arm whenever we came to a crossing or any place where he might take advantage Prisoner I did not say I was not the person who took the letter on Saturday night—but addressing me as fellow I did not choose to give his satisfaction and said I knew nothing about it Witness He did deny it

wrists on coming down the stairs he said he should like top have a cab—I sent one of my brother officers for one—the prisoner got in first and before I could get in he jumped out on the opposite side and ran away as fast as he could—I pursued him crying Stop thief and overtook him—he was stopped by some person—he gave the name of Charles William—he was called by that name and answered to it JAMES COLLINS I live in little Bolton-street Kennington I have known the prisoner five or six months—his name is Henry Carter—I know his mother—I know that is his right name Prisoner s Defence written All that I have to say is that I always gained my living by my industry—I did not know that I was doing any thing wrong at this time—I get my living chiefly by sealing-wax making but not having enough to do at my trade I had a bill in my window stating that I delivered messages and parcels which I did to fill up my time On Saturday evening a gentlemanly-looking man giving his name Harris he was about five feet seven inches in height fair complexion of light hair came to my house and asked me if I knew Lime-street City I told him I did upon which he gave me a letter directed to Mr Beach Lime-street and told me to wait for an answer—when I brought him a letter to the Elephant and Castle according to appointment at half-past nine o clock he read it and then gave me 2s 6d for my trouble and said if I would meet him at the Ram Inn Smithfield on Monday morning at eleven o clock he would have another job for me which I accordingly did when he gave me a cheque to take to Messrs Esdaile and Company Lombard Street and receive the money for it I was to make haste and he would be at the Ram in three quarters of an hour—I went not having the least suspicion that any thing was wrong as I had done many similar jobs—when I came to the banker s a gentleman asked me who I came from—I told him Mr Harris—then another gentleman said I must go with him which I very willingly did not then having any suspicion—he took me to a Mr Harris in Fen-church-street when he gave me in charge for forging the cheque of which I am entirely innocent Being the first time I ever was in any sort of confinement and having always supported my mother and myself by my industry I hope gentleman you will consider the unpleasant situation I am now placed in and that I was completely led into it by some artful person and that I am entirely innocent of the charge—and that is the whole truth of the case JURY to MR BEACH Q When you wrote the answer did you direct it to Mr Harris in Fenchurch-street A I do not remember having put Fenchurch-street on the note—nothing passed between the prisoner and me about where Harris lived—I asked him if he had the cheque and he said Yes —he did not offer to produce it JURY to MR HARRIS Q Does that cheque very much resemble the cheques you draw on your banker s A It does not because I always write the cheque as well as sign it—the signature is a resemblance of my writing but the amount and figures do not all resemble mine—I have no knowledge of the prisoner JAMES COLLINS re-examined The prisoner is a sealing-wax maker—he goes about with messages and parcels and had hired me to go for him when he could not go himself—I do not know I that he has a notice in his window MR BODKIN Q Do you live in the same house as the prisoner A Next door to him and on this side of his house—I have a place away from home and do not come home above once a months or so—I was not at home on Saturday the 15th of October—I have never looked at his window as the street is no thoroughfare I never passed his house—there is a ditch runs across the bottom of the street—there are twelve houses on one side and eleven on the other Q Then a bill there would only be seen by people in the street A A great many people come down thinking it is a thoroughfare JAMES COLLINS SEN I live with my son and am employed at Vauxhall-gardens The prisoner is occasionally employed gardening and carrying parcels—I considered him an industrious sober young man Thomas Anderson also deposed to the prisoner s good character GUILTY of Uttering Aged 20 — Transported for Life Before Mr Justice

t18370102-424  424 GEORGE FORBES ATKINSON was indicted for that he on the 10th of February at St James Westminster feloniously did falsely make and forge a certain bill of exchange for the payment of 4000l with intent to defraud Lauderdale Maule —2nd Count for offering uttering disposing of and putting off the same with the like intent —3rd and 4th COUNTS stating his intent to be to defraud Richard Kirkman Lane —5th and 6th COUNTS to defraud Richard Henry Cox and others MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution CAPTAIN LAUDERDALE MAULE I am a Captain in the 79th Highland regiment—I was formerly in the 89th Foot—I am one of the sons of Lord Panmure In the early part of 1835 I had occasion to borrow 1000l and on the 11th of February I had an introduction to the prisoner for that purpose—I had a conversation with him upon the subject and saw him again in consequence of that on the 14th of February at No 107 Jermyn-street which is an hotel and on that occasion I accepted a bill of exchange—be-fore I accepted it it was drawn and indorsed by Mr Atkinson—I believe this to be my acceptance which I gave him on the 14th of February 1835— looking at it —I never gave him any other for that amount—it was drawn at three months date and would be due in May—after I accepted it the prisoner was to get it discounted for my use—I waited some days to enable him to procure the money—on the 23rd of February 1 called on him on the subject and he told me the bill for £1000 was too large and that he could not get it discounted and he said he thought he could get two for 500l discounted better—he proposed to draw two I said I would give him one in the mean time—he said as the £1000 bill bore both our signatures it might as well be destroyed upon which he pulled from I believe his right-hand waistcoat-pocket a piece of paper which he said was my bill for 1000l —he had it in his hands a little while—he unfolded it tore it in two and threw it on the fire—I believed it to be my acceptance for 1000l —he did not put it into my hands—I saw it in his hand but did not read it—it had every appearance of my bill—I then accepted the bill for £500—in consequence of information which I received I called on him on the 1st of March—I had not then received any money at all from him—I never received any thing from him—when I called on him on the 1st of March I requested him to return me my bill for £500—I do not exactly recollect whether I assigned any reason for doing so—to the best of my recollection he took it from a small pocket-book and handed it to me—it was my bill—I examined it tore it and threw it into the fire—on the 1st of November I went abroad with my regiment and while at Quebec I received a letter from Mr Lane—I returned from Quebec about the middle of October 1836 and was sent from Portsmouth to Glasgow without landing—I got leave of absence on the 17th of December and on the 19th arrived in London and in consequence of information from Mr Lane in three days I went before a Magistrate Q Look at this instrument is that in the state it was when you accepted it on the 14th of February 1835 A It is not—it has not the same period to run as it had when I accepted it—the word three previous to the word months has been altered to twelve—I think the top of the in of the word three is quite apparent now—I also think the alteration is evident of the double—I think I perceive that still and I also think the whole of the bill has been written over again—the size of the letters has been strengthened—the signature has not been touched—the words are the same as before but they are done over again with a different and a stronger ink—what schoolboys call painting COURT Q You think the G F Atkinson stands as it did originally but do you think your name has had a re-writing on it A No I do not think my signature has been touched—the alteration does not apply to the acceptance—it docs to the G F Atkinson but my name is evidently not affected MR CLARKSON Q As it stands at present with the word twelve instead of three is the word twelve thicker in the strokes than the word three was in the bill A To the best of my recollection it is—writing over the whole body of the bill would give it the same appearance as to thickness—until I received Mr Lane s letter in May 1836 I had not the slightest idea that any bill of exchange of mine of twelve months after date was in the market COURT Q Was the original bill drawn by the prisoner in your presence A It was—my signature was written with the same ink as the bill MR CLARKSON Q Can you recollect whether you wrote with the same pen as him Q I cannot—I never accepted a bill at twelve months after date in my life—I did not authorize him after February to negotiate for any purpose or any period any bill of mine for £1000 —I did not authorize him after I took back the £500 bill on the 1st of March to I negotiate any bill for me whatever—I never gave or lent him for his accommodation my acceptance for any sum Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Where were you living at the time you accepted the bill A At the Colonnade hotel Charles-street St James s-square—I was introduced to Mr Atkinson on the 14th of February by a gentleman named Batters by who is an officer in the army—I do not know whether he is dead—I never knew Captain Ashley the son of Lord Shaftesbury—this transaction took plage at the York hotel—I never knew it by any name except the York hotel or Lane s hotel—I never knew it as the Ton —I may have been at the York hotel ten or twelve times—I never knew it called the Ton —I do not know that it is place where people meet for play Q In what room did the transaction take place A In a room which I understood to be Mr Atkinson s own room—it was a private room—there was nobody there but myself and him Q How came you to negotiate with a man you had only known a few days for the acceptance of a bill of exchange A I was introduced to him for that very purpose—I am not aware that he advertised as a moneylender or any thing of the kind—he was to have no benefit from this bill at least there was no agreement of that nature—I cannot recollect the precise conversation the precise understanding that there was—he was not to have half the 1000l the money was solely for ray own use—the bill is directed to me at Brechin Castle Forfar North Britain which is my father s residence—it was my home when I chose to go there—I was in the army at the time—the bill might as well be presented there as any where else—there was no one present when the bill was accepted—the stamp was sent out for to the best of my recollection by Mr Atkinson—I gave him the money to pay for it—I cannot recollect whether it was silver or gold that I gave him—I believe it was ten or twelve shillings but I do not recollect—some house-boy was sent for it Q How many days afterwards did you have your supposed £1000 bill back again A On the 1st of March I think it was on a Sunday—there might have been somebody in the room when I gave the£500 bill but I will not be positive—I do not think there was any body within bearing—I do not think it was in the same room where the first bill was accepted—I think the £500 bill was given back to me in the public room as far as I can recollect but I will not be quite sure—I do not know whether there were persons there—I do not think there are boxes in the room—I did not have the bill in my hand which he tore up and threw into the fire—I went abroad on the 1st of November to New York Q Look at that bill again and tell me do you mean to say there is any part of the letter h in it A To the best of my opinion the top of is visible—there is certainly a black stroke on the other side but in my opinion it does not hide the top of the h—I think it evident the letter is has been there—I had no other acquaintance with Mr Atkinson than what occurred in the coffee-house—I might have seen him but I had no particular acquaintance with him—Captain Battersby lived in the same house and I have seen Mr Atkinson several times when I have called on Captain Battersby MR CLARKSON Q Pray is the bill made payable at Cox and Greenwood s although addressed to Brechin Castle A It is—that was done at my instance—Cox and Greenwood were my agents then—if I had received the money I intended to have provided for it there at the end of three months—they were the agents for the regiment 1 was in—Captain Battersby is an officer I knew and he lived in the same house as the prisoner appeared to be living in—I have dined once or twice in the house with Captain Battersby I believe—I recollect the prisoner s being present on one occasion at dinner—that was after I supposed the acceptance had been destroyed to the best of my recollection RICHARD KIRKMAN LANE I am an attorney and reside at No 29 Argyle-street 1 am the present holder of this acceptance purporting to be at twelve months date for 1000l —I received it from the prisoner about the 14th or 15th of February 1836—it was in precisely the same state as it is now with the exception that my indorsement has been since added and erased—when inquiry was made on the subject I erased my indorsement when I produced it at Bow-street Cross-examined Q Had you known the prisoner before A About four or five years—I have brought an action against Captain Maule on the bill by serviceable process—I examined the bill before I took it with regard to the date February 28 1835 and also with regard to the acceptanee The bill was here put in and read MR ADOLPHUS addressed the

DUNCKLEY I am an undertaker and live in Tower-street Westminster-road In July last the prisoner came to me with a printed parish order for the funeral of Stockings I am undertaker for the parish of St

me if I would write on a piece of paper stating as to when Stockings died and to place it to the best of my recollection backwards or forwards that she might obtain the pension—I rather think it was forwards—I was to state his name and age when he died and when he was buried—I refused giving her any thing but a correct copy from the parish order Cross-examined Q What did she say about backwards or forwards A Her intention was to have it forward—I said I would write her a correct B copy and leave it for her to call for—that was all that pawed then—I did C so and it laid there a month MR

prisoner before—I recognize the note by the name of Williamson on it and there is 2—2 and 37—I observed that the same day before I put in to the bag Q Were you so certain that if you had been asked

through my hands—I did not lose sight of it when I give it to my husband WILLIAM BARRETT I am the husband of Elizabeth Barrett I was in tht adjoining room when the note was given to my wife—I did not see it given—next day I received it from my wife to look at after I had been to Mr Watson s about the pot—Mr Watson returned with me to look at the note—I received it from my wife and took it to the

copper—the gin came to eight-pence—he brought a bottle for it—when I gave him the change being busy I handed him pen and ink on the counter and asked him to mark the note—he wrote the name of William Smith No 13 Walbrook on it—there was another name on it below that— looking at a note —this is the note—I threw it down on the table in the bar parlour and before I put it into the drawer I wrote the name myself which he wrote Smith Walbrook —I afterwards made inquiry at 13 Walbrook but could find no William Smith there neither lodger nor housekeeper Cross-examined Q Your hand-writing is on the

memory is pretty good—I am not apt to make mistake—every man is liable to mistakes and of course I among the rest but I do not make a mistake in the thing I identify—I do not know that I have made a mistake on this subject Q Did you think you had seen the prisoner before and take him for another man A Oh the face is very familiar to me—I took his face to be one I knew when he came into the shop on the Saturday night—I thought I knew him but I found out I was wrong—I know his face is very familiar to me—I did not say I thought I knew him Q Do you swear you never said this I thought I knew him but it turned out I was mistaken in the person I took him for A I thought it was—this is my signature— looking at his deposition —the deposition being read contained the following sentence —I had never seen him before but I thought I knew him but it turned out I was mistaken in the person I took him for—I am quite positive the prisoner is the man I took it of Q Do you hear that A Yes—the reason I said that was because another person s face was familiar to me and I thought I knew him so well I did not hesitate in giving him the money—I looked at him very bard and when I came to see him

Commercial-road—my mother is a lodger there—his business occupies him the principal part of the day as far as I know—I have no idea where that is MR PHILLIPS Q If I understand you right you live with your husband A Yes—I have no family—I have buried them—my brother called on me occasionally—I never asked him what shop he worked at COURT Q Where were you married A At Shoreditch church—I made my mark there—I could have brought my certificate if I had thought of it WILLIAM SIMPSON I am collecting-clerk to a coal-merchant I have known the prisoner about ten years—I should say he cannot write from circumstances which I know MR ADOLPHUS Q What has he been in the ten years you have known him A I can hardly tell—I should call him a smuggler—a dealer in contraband goods cigars and brandy—in the general smuggling line—I do not know that they are smuggled but I imagine so—he may have done other things during the ten years but I have purchased cigars of him—I do not know of his being in the employ of a cigar manufacturer—he used to serve customers—I did not know him as a servant at shops—I do not know his mother I know his sister—he did not live at her house at all that I know of—I do not know her house—I do not know her husband nor what he is except from what I have heard Q Pray have you known the prisoner within the last two yean and a half dealing in brandy and things A Yes—I heard of his being under steward of a steam-boat—I do not know it of my own knowledge Q I suppose the under-steward of a steamer ought to know how to read and write A I do not presume to give my opinion on that but I know he cannot—he cannot read the newspaper—he has asked me to read it to him a dozen times or more especially within the last two years—I have seen him the last two months—I cannot tell what he has been in that time—I really do not think he can tell B from O from his ignorance—I can tell you an instance Q Have you known him in all the time doing any thing to gain an honest livelihood A No except dealing in cigars—I believe he got them from stewards of steamers—I am collecting-clerk to Mr Morris of Sun Wharf Ratcliff and have been so fifteen or eighteen months constantly in his employ and am so At the present moment—it is quite by accident I am here—I came to collect money in the Old Bailey and saw Mr Kelly the attorney for the defence who requested me to come in—I came to collect from Mr Smith over the way and at the Dolphin on Ludgate-bill—I have the Dolphin bill in my pocket—it is my master Mr Morris s bill— producing it —I was at Lambeth-street when the prisoner was under examination Q Did you say any thing to the Justice about his being unable to read or write A I had no occasion to do that—I went there for my own pleasure on that occasion to hear the evidence which would be adduced against the prisoner—I know some of his acquaintances MR PHILLIPS Q You were going to give an instance by which you know the prisoner could not read or write A Yes—on one occasion he asked me to write a letter for him—that is about six seven or eight weeks ago MR ADOLPHUS Q Was it before or after the 18th of November A I should say it was previous to that COURT Q How often have you read a paper for him within the last two years A I recollect one case particularly about two men being charged at the Thames police-office with smuggling—one of them was sent for three months imprisonment and he asked me to read the particulars to him—that is about six months ago—I should say he had asked me to read the paper to him half a dozen times within six months—he came to a public house I used in an evening and when he wanted to know the particular I read it to him—on another occasion he gave me a stamp and said it might be of service to me—I said What stamp is it 1s 6d or what —he said I don t know —I took it up and looked at it and he said Look at him he is looking if it is a January one instead of a genuine one JAMES LINDON I am a turnkey in Clerkenwell prison The prisoner was there on this charge and in the course of his imprisonment he asked me to write a letter for him which I did as he said he could not write himself COURT Q That was after the charge was made against him A About a fortnight ago MR PHILLIPS Q Do you know was it before or after he was before the Magistrate on this charge A I think it was before the last examination MR MAULE Q How long have you known him A Not till he was in custody at the New Prison—I never saw him before he was sent there for this offence—it was after he was examined and remanded he asked me to write the letter—it was directed to Mr Kelly a solicitor—I never saw him in the prison before to my knowledge—I cannot swear it—I might have seen him—I see some hundreds in the course of a year MR PHILLIPS Q Have you any favour or affection for him A None whatever one man is the same to me as another MR MAULE Q Is it not part of your duty as turnkey to know the prisoners A It may be—I have been turnkey ten years—it if put of our duty to know the faces of prisoners—I should say that I never saw this man before but I see so many hundreds Q Are you ready to swear he was not in your custody last May for Clerkenwell A I should say I never saw him before but I will not swear it MR PHILLIPS Q Is this the letter you wrote for him — producing one A It is—I should think I have seen 14 or 15 000 prisoners in the prison since I have been there JAMES WINSON I am a dyer I have known the prisoner eight or nine years—to the best of my knowledge he can neither read nor write—I have read newspapers for him many times MR ADOLPHUS Q What has he been A A vender of cigars for himself principally I believe—he has been on board the Dundee stemer as second or third steward—he may very probably have dealt in brandy and other things—I cannot say to the contrary—to the best of my know ledge I believe he has—I have purchased cigars of him—I have know him offer brandy for sale—I never learnt from him how he got the brandy and cigars but I believe they were smuggled principally—I should not think it necessary for a steward on board a steamer to be able to write—I never knew the prisoner read or write in my life—I live at No 2 Bellwharf Shad well—I have lived there seven or eight years—I am a master dyer—I always heard that the prisoner lived with his mother—I seen him at his mother s when she was in lodgings—I never knew him living in School-house-yard Whitechapel—nor any place of that kind COURT Q How many people have you in your employ A Only one MR MONTAGUE re-examined Q Do you remember at Lambeth-street any person telling you that the prisoner could not write A Not at the office—it was when I was down at the Flying Horse—it was not said to me particularly but I believe it was this person Simpson said so—that was the same day but after I was at the office—he expressed the same antidote about the bill January or genuine GUILTY Aged 24 — Transported for Life Before Mr

t18380402-1092  1092 THOMAS IVISON was indicted for feloniously forging a certain order for the payment of £100 with intent to defraud Sir Richard Carr Glynn and others —2nd COUNT for uttering the same with a like intent —Other COUNTS varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution JOHN GARWOOD I am clerk to Mr John Widdows an attorney in Copthall-court Throgmorton-street I know the prisoner by his coming to see Mr Widdows—on Monday the 26th of February he came and gave me this cheque and said You are to go and receive this cheque and that he was to wait while I went with it—I went to Glynn and Co s—when I got there I was detained by Forrester the officer who went back with me to Copthall-court but the prisoner had left—he was afterwards taken at his father s Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You had known him a good while I suppose A Yes—I do not know where he lived WILLIAM THOMAS I am cashier to Glynn Halifax and Co bankers We have an account with Adam Joseph Kopsch and Co —on the 26th of February Garwood came with a cheque—I believe this to be the cheque—I had no doubt it was a forgery immediately I saw it—it was shown to the partners and Forrester was sent for Cross-examined Q Are you sure that is the same cheque A I can not be sure but I have no doubt of it—I believe it to be the cheque—I will not undertake to swear positively to it MR DOANE Q Did you mark the cheque he brought A Yes—his has my mark—Mr Masters brought it to me as he was going out with Forrester and I marked it—I had left it in the room with Mr Halifax one of the partners and Mr Daniel the chief clerk—Mr Barber was there—he went into the room with me—I did not see him with the cheque—I left it with Mr Daniel and Mr Halifax—I did not mark it till Mr Mastery was going away FREDEBICK BARBER I am a clerk in the banking-house I was in the same office as Mr Thomas—he brought the cheque from his desk to me and I took it to Kopsch and Co by his directions—I returned the cheque to him again when I came back and he took it into the partners room WIILIAM THOMAS re-examined When I first received the cheque I gave it to Barber to take to Kopsch and Co —he brought it back and gave it to me and I took it into the partners room immediately—Garwood went in with me and Mr Kopsch who had come back with Barber and I think Barber went in also—I left the cheque there and Mr Masters afterwards brought it to me to mark—I will not swear positively this is the same cheque but to the best of my belief it is—I have no doubt about it—I wear to the mark which I made on it—the drawer s name is the same as was on the cheque presented the sum is the same and it has every apearance of it THOMAS HALIFAX ESQ I am a partner in the firm of Glynn and Co I member this cheque being brought into the partners room—I cannot say in whose hands it was when I first saw it—Mr Thomas was one of the persons who came in I believe and one of the partners of Kopsch s house—Mr Daniel our manager was in the room at the time—Garwood was brought in to me—I will not say whether Garwood was in the room or whether I only saw him through the glass door outside but he was never lost sight of—my present idea is that he was in the partners room—the cheque was shown to me—I directed Mr Daniel to send for Messrs Bush and Masters and Mr Masters came—to the best of my belief I did not leave the room from the time of the cheque s being brought into the room till the arrival of Mr Masters—I do not know that I saw the cheque given to anybody after Mr Masters arrival—Mr Mills was in the room and I think Mr Glynn Cross-examined Q Can you say into How many different hands the cheque went A No I will not swear positively—I might not have left the room before Mr Masters came—I cannot say more than to the best of my knowledge and belief—Garwood was in the room—there might have been other persons there COURT Q Can you say whether that is the same cheque or not A cannot swear to the cheque but I believe it is from the peculiarity of the writing the figures and the word company —I looked at it when it was bought me and inquired of Mr Kopsch s partner about the writing—the amount of this cheque corresponds with that which was produced to me—I do not think I remarked the date—I noticed the signature but only in a neral way—it was the same name as this—I noticed the two 00 had not the regular distance between them and the I—it was in an irregular mode MR DOANE Q Was any other cheque drawn by Kopsch and Co brought into your room that day A Certainly not—no other came under my observation—I do not remember seeing or hearing of any other—I have no doubt this is the same cheque but I cannot swear to it CHARLES MILLS ESQ I am one of the firm of Glynn and Co I came into the room at the time in question—something was mentioned to me and I asked to see the cheque which was given to me—it was lying on the private desk of Mr Daniel the managing clerk in the inner-room and I either took it off the desk or it was given to me—Mr Halifax was in the room—Mr Masters the solicitor afterwards came there and I gave the cheque to him—my attention was drawn to the signature and amount—I had been told before I came in that it was ascertained to be a forgery—this cheque has the same signature is to the same amount and to the best of my belief it is the same cheque—I did not see any other cheque in the room drawn by the same party—there was no other cheque that day about which there was any difficulty to my knowledge Cross-examined Q You were not at home I suppose all the day A I was not in the room when it was brought in JOHN DENNIS DANIEL I am managing clerk in the banking-house of Messrs Glynn Halifax and Co I sit in a room called the partners room—it is separated by a glass screen—I can see into the office—I remember a cheque being brought in by Mr Thomas the cashier signed Kopsch and Co —I do not remember Mr Mills coming in—I was backwards and forwards in the office from time to time—doubts had arisen about the cheque and it was settled that we should send to Mr Kopsch about it—I nobody came in with Mr Thomas—Mr Thomas Halifax was in the room when he came in—I dare say I was in and out two or three times—I saw the cheque again when I came in—I left Mr Halifax in the room when I went out and found him there when I came in till Mr Masters arrived—there was no other cheque drawn by Kopsch and Co brought in that I know of—when Mr Thomas brought the cheque in he showed it to me and then took it out again—he afterwards brought the same cheque in again with Mr Kopsch who pronounced it to be a forgery—it was then laid on my desk—I did not remain in the room all the time till Mr Masters came but was sometimes there and sometimes in the outer office MR EDWARD LEE MASTERS I am in partnership with Mr Bush We are the solicitors for this prosecution—I have produced the cheque which I got from Messrs Glynn s on the 26th of February—I received it from Mr Mills s hands—I showed it difectly after to Mr Thomas who put his initials on it before it was taken out of the banking-house— cheque read ADAM JOSEPH KOPSCH I am a silk-merchant in partnership with Mr Thomas Naylor We kept an account with Glynn and Co in February last—I know the prisoner his father is a respectable silk-broker—the prisoner used to come to our house on business—we keep our cheque-book on the desk in the daytime—neither the signature nor any part of this cheque is my writing—it seems to be dated the 23rd of February—I had seen the prisoner at our premises not above a day or two before I was called on about the cheque—I do not recollect the date—I went with the person who came from the banking-house—I cannot say How long it was before that that I had seen the prisoner at my counting-house—it was decidedly within a week—I recollect a Person bringing the cheque to my counting-house—I will not swear it was Mr Barbel—he showed me the cheque and it was a forgery—this looks very much like the cheque—it is drawn in the same name and for the same amount Cross-examined Q What are your Christian names A Adam Joseph—my cheques are generally signed in that way MR BODKIN Q Do you authorise anybody to sign cheques for you —A Nobody except my partner THOMAS NAYLOR I am partner with Mr Kopsch This cheque is not in my handwriting—I authorised nobody to sign it or fill it up—I have seen the prisoner at our counting-house—he used to bring samples from his father—I have never seen him write in the counting-house—I had seen him there within a week Cross-examined Q Do you know a young man named Marquis A Yes he was in our employment a short time—he has been sought after lately but the search has been given up—he can be found—he has been seen—I understand several parties have seen him—a gentleman named Marker has seen him—I do not know that he has absconded—Mr Kopsch has authorised persons to search for him MR KOPSCH re-examined I have authorised somebody to search for Marquis as there were suspicions against him—I have not been able to find him—it was not an officer I told to search for him—I authorised Mr Fellowes to advertise for him Q Was it not in consequence of his being suspected of having given the prisoner the false cheque A No—it was long before the cheque was produced that he was advertised for—we were suspicious of his having committed a theft—I have not advertised for him since this nor sent anybody to search for him—he could go into our counting-house when he was in our service which was not above two or three months—during that time the cheque book laid on the desk as usual—he is about twenty-two or twenty-three years of age and is married Q Have you ever expressed any opinion as to the handwriting of A J Kopsch and Co signed to the cheque A No not to my recollection—I will not swear I have not—I believe I have said that it looked like Marquis s handwriting MR BODKIN Q When did you say that A As far as I can recollect at the time it was presented to me—Marquis left our service about December—he had no means of access to our counting-house after that—if he had come after he left I should have had him apprehended—the signature to the cheque is a little like mine but not much—it is written in the same style as if to imitate it—the one hundred does not look at all like my writing nor the February nor the ciphers Q When you said you thought it was Marquis s writing did you say so from an inspection of the writing or from the knowledge that Marquis had committed another offence A Both from the writing and his having committed another offence—it is impossible to tell whose handwriting it is because a few letters are like and others quite different JOSHUA PAUL WANNESS I am clerk to the Newspaper Association Office I am a friend of Messrs Kopsch—I was at their office on Saturday the 24th of February last from seven o clock till after nine o clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner there—he was backwards and forwards—he occasionally came in took up a pen and wrote at the desk at the opposite side to where I was sitting—I was perhaps three or four feet from him the width of the desk—it was a double desk—he could write any thing without a person on the opposite side seeing what he wrote Cross-examined Q Could you see what kind of paper he was writing on A No I could not—he was standing at the desk—I did not pay the least attention to it—I was not before the Magistrate JOHN FORRESTER I am one of the principal officers at the Mansion-house—I took the prisoner into custody on Monday the 26th of Febrary the same day I had been sent for to Glynn s banking-house—I found him at Mr Kopsch s in Crown-court Broad-street—I told him I took him for presenting a cheque at Glynn s—he said nothing—I searched him and found on him a letter containing two pieces of paper—he never spoke at all Cross-examined Q Was not the letter a valentine A Yes I should call it so—he was crying when I went into the room—the letter was open when I saw it—it was addressed to him The letter being ready was a valentine upon which was written Answered 17th of February to Miss Widdows Church-street Stoke Newington The papers were memorandums of several sums of money one of which had A J Kopsch and Co written several times upon it MR KOPSCH re-examined — Looking at the papery—I have never seen this before to my recollection—the name A J Kopsch and Co is written in very much the same style of writing as mine Cross-examined Q Is it very much the same style of writing as you see signed to the cheque A It looks like it GUILTY of uttering Aged 15 —Recommended to mercy by the Jury and Prosecutor on

t18380402-943  943 WILLIAM PHILLIPS was again indicted for feloniously forgoing an order for the payment of 310l with intent to defraud James Whatmas Bosanquet and others seven other counts varying the charge MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution JOHN FRYER I am clerk in the banking-house of James Whatman Bosanquet and Co —there are three partners On the 17th of January this cheque for 310l drawn by Kerslake and Co was presented to me it payment—I do not know who presented it—the person first paid in a cheque for 284l 10s on Dixon and Brook to the credit of Kerslake and Co and then presented this cheque drawn by Kerslake and Co for payment—I recollect the transaction and am sure it was the same personal—he never moved from the counter—I paid him the amount 310l—there were but two persons at the counter at the time WILLIAM BELTON CREALOCK I am a solicitor in partnership with Mr Karslake and carry on business in Regent-street The prisoner was in our employ as clerk from the 1st of January 1832 down to the 15th of August 1835—at that time we kept a cash account at Bosanquet s—I was in the habit of drawing cheques on account of office business and sending them by clerks and I was also in the habit of paying in drafts which I received on other banks—we generally paid in and presented drafts at the same time if we had occasion as we lived at some distance from the bankers—the prisoner would have the opportunity of knowing that practice—in July 1835 I received a letter from Griffiths Jones of Welsh Pool—I had before that spoken to the prisoner about his irregular attendance and he said if he did not give satisfaction he had better go and I said he had—I afterwards received this letter from Welsh Pool to which I wrote an answer and gave it to the prisoner to take a copy of by the machine—after making the copy he brought it to me himself—he had no authority from me to make a second copy—he never told me that he had done so— looking at two sheets of paper —these appear to be copies of the two first sheets of the same letter—they were no doubt made the machine—the signature I use in drawing drafts on bankers correspond generally with the signature I use in signing letters— looking at the cheque —this certainly not my writing nor my partner s—it is a very bad imitation—I did not authorise that cheque to be drawn—the signature to this copy of the letter is my hand-writing—the signature to the cheque is certainly like the signature to the copy of the letter particularly in the K—Kerslake—it is seldom I make such a K and the cheque and letter correspound in that particular—I never authorised this cheque on Dixon and Brooks to be paid into Bosanquet s on my account—I believe the words One hundred and eighty and the signature James Smith in that cheque to be the prisoner s hand-writing—they bear the strongest mark of his handwriting but I should say all the cheque is his hand-writing decidedly—he was three years and a half in our office and I saw him write almost very day—I believe the whole cheque to be his writing but this portion more strongly than the rest—the figures of the year 1838 on this 310l cheque I should say are his figures—it is an imitation of my own handwriting throughout—the character is not like the characters of the prisoner s ting HENRY KARSLAKE I am a partner of Mr Crealock s This cheque is not my hand-writing—I never authorised any body to draw it RICHARD MULLINS I am clerk to Kerlake and Co and have been so rather more than five years—the prisoner was there when I first went—I have seen him write many times—I believe the whole of this cheque on Dixon and Co to be his hand-writing except the words not known written in the corner—the figures 38 in the cheque in question are like the prisoner s ordinary writing and the 16 in the January—the rest is an imitation of Mr Crealock s writing—I believe the figures I have named are the prisoner s hand-writing COURT Q Do your employers keep a cheque—book A Yes—it is printed cheque MATTHEW BAKER I am clerk to Karslake and Co and was so when the prisoner was in their employ—I have frequently seen him write—part of this cheque on Dixon strongly bears the characters of the hand-writing of the prisoner and I believe from the character it is his hand-writing— looking at the cheque —the 38 in the date of the year and the 16 in the month very strongly resemble his ordinary handwriting—I believe it to be his hand-writing Cross—examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Were you examined before the magistrate A No—I believe the whole of the second cheque to be the prisoner s—that is my belief of both cheques MR BODKIN Q What is your belief of the 310l one A That it is the hand-writing of the prisoner—I can see the character of his hand-writing through the whole of it—it is not his ordinary hand but casting my eye through it from beginning to end there is something in the character and style of it leading me to believe it is his COURT Q Does it appear a disguised hand but written by a character which is familiar to you A Yes MR CREALOCK re-examined My cheque-book is usually kept in my drawer and my partner kept a cheque-book in his room which was not lacked up—the prisoner would not have had the least difficulty in possessing himself of blank cheques if so disposed JOSIAH WATHEN I am a solicitor and live in Bedford-row In the latter part of 1836 the prisoner applied for a situation in my office—he showed me a letter written from Messrs Karslake and Crealock which I believe to be this—I have a strong recollection that there was a third sheet to it—I do not recollect whether there was a signature but I apprehend there was or I should not have taken notice of it—I read the letter JOHN ROE I am a City officer I was with Forrester when he apprehended the prisoner in Trafalgar-street Walworth-road on the 2nd of February—Forrester had got up to him before me—I got the papers produced at No 1 Clifton-street Wands worth-road—nothing that the prisoner said took me there DANIEL FORRESTER I am an officer I accompanied Roe to Walworth—I saw the prisoner some distance down Trafalgar-street—I followed him and stopped him when he turned two or three streets—I said Your name is Phillips I believe —he said No it is not —I said I think it is if you will step back here is a person I think will say so —he denied it—I said What is your name —he did not give me his name at the time—I said The fact is I believe your name is Phillips and I shall arrest you —on that he said You will be careful and then said his name was Thompson—I told him it was for something that happened at Mr Whiteside s—he then acknowledged his name was Phillips and said the reason he had denied it was that he was in difficulties—I went to No 99 Trafalgar-street and found some bills and things there—I afterwards went to No 1 Clifton-street Lark-hall-lane—the prisoner was not with me— I followed a person there—I found an elderly lady there—I searched the place and found various papers— looking at the two papers —I recollect seeing them there or papers like them—we brought all the papers away and they were among them Cross-examined Q Were you examined before the Magistrate A Yes—I have not signed any deposition JOHN SANKEY I am owner of the houses Nos 1 2 and 3 Cliftone-street—the prisoner took the house No 1 on the 21st of May 1836 and continued to occupy it till the 29th of January 1838—he took the whole house Cross-examined Q Were you before the Magistrate A No—the prisoner paid his rent punctually at first but I have had occasion to show him lenity about it MR BODKIN Q Did he at any time pay your arrears A Yes on the 29th of January he paid me the arrears—he owed 6l 4s MR PHILLIPS Q Are you aware of his mother receiving a quarterly allowance A Yes—he generally paid me at the time of her allowance becoming due MR BODKIN Q Was that the case in January A I believe she received it on the 10th Mr Waite a barrister s clerk Henry Worth a solicitor s clerk and Algernon Sidney Spark a short-hand writer deposed to the prisoner s good character GUILTY Aged 39 — Transported for Life

t18380514-1251  1251 JOHN CLATER and GEORGE OLLEY were indicted for feloniously uttering a forged transfer of £50 which was jointly possessed in the new 31/4 per Cent Annuities by the said John Clater and Robert Thomas Wood with intent to defraud the Governor and Company of the Bank of England well knowing it to be forged —2nd COUNT with intent to defraud Robert Thomas Wood —3rd COUNT with intent to defraud Robert Barker MESSRS MAULE ADOLPHUS and BULLOCK conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM DRINKWATER I am a clerk in the New Three and a Half per Cents at the Bank I have an extract from the books of stock to the amount of 250l which stood in the names of Clater and Wood in 1833—none of that stock now remains in the names of those persons—it was transferred at several times—the last transfer was the sum of 50l on the 26th of October 1836—I subscribed this transfer looking at it as attesting witness—who the parties were that applied to transfer that stock I do not know WILLIAM HENRY HAWKINS I am a stockbroker I carried on business at the Rotunda till lately—I now carry it on in the Stock Exchange—I know the prisoner Clater—I first became acquainted with him on the 1st of February 1833—he was introduced to me by a Mr March stating that he wanted to purchase some stock and on that occasion I purchased 250l in the Three and a Half per Cents in the names of John Clater and Robert Thomas Wood—the money was paid by Clater—I had other transactions with him—the last was on the 26th of October 1836—on that occasion 50l stock was sold from the names of Thomas Clater and Robert Thomas Wood—the instructions for the sale were given in the morning to my clerk—I have extracts from my book made by myself—my clerk is here—the transfer was made and I signed the draft for 49l 1s 3d —this is my draft— looking at it —it is drawn on Williams Deacon and Co —that was for the proceeds of the stock—I delivered the cheque to my clerk—I have known the prisoner Olley since the 3rd of March 1836—he was introduced by Clater as Robert Thomas Wood—that was on the occasion of the first sale of the stock—25l of this stock was sold on that occasion—I saw him subsequently with Clater on eight different occasions—they were for similar transactions—he was represented on those occasions as Robert Thomas Wood Cross-examined by MR JONES Q I observe you refer to a paper to enable you to say how often you saw Olley A Yes—that does not assist me in recollecting that he was the person I saw with Clater—to the best of my belief the 26th of October 1836 was the last time I saw him before he was charged with this offence—I have not seen him since to my knowledge—I cannot say precisely how he was dressed the first time I saw him—he was rather shabbily dressed—I saw him a very short time on each occasion—it might be nine or ten minutes—it was longer than three or four minutes—I should say five minutes—I see a great number of persons in the course of a day—he had dark clothes and I think a dark brown coat but I cannot be positive—he was not dressed precisely the same on all occasions but he was very shabby each time—I do not examine people s dresses—my clerk took the greater part in the transaction—I did not know Robert Thomas Wood—I do now—he has informed me that he came with Clater when the stock was first bought in but I have no recollection of it—I saw him a short time previous to Clater being taken on this charge—I had not any recollection then of his being the person who accompanied Clater when the stock was bought in—Mr March introduced him—I have no recollection of Mr March saying any thing about the person who was in company with Clater—I knew March I believe he is a respectable person—I have never expressed any doubt as to Olley being the man who was with Clater—there was a momentary doubt I may say on the morning Olley was taken—I did not say I was not certain he was the man—I do not remember making use of any expression at all—my impression was that he was the man when I first saw him—I do not remember expressing any doubt but it was a serious charge and I wished to be very cautious before I said any thing—I am almost sure I did not express any doubt I have no recollection of it—the first time I saw him was as he passed before the Mansion-house in the street—I was standing at the front gate and had a passing view of him—I afterwards saw him in the Justice-room MR MAULS Q Look at him now—are you sure that is the person you saw eight times on the transfer of the stock A I have no doubt—the momentary doubt I had was when he came into the under part of the Mansion-house which is very dark—he had a hat on then—when I saw him at the bar of the Justice-room I had no doubt and have none now GEORGE THOMAS SKINNER I am brother-in-law of Mr Hawkins and assist him in his business I have seen the prisoner Clater several times and I believe Olley is the man who accompanied him—Clater gave the instructions for the sales—the other prisoner was not with him then—on the 26th of October I received instructions from Clater who was then alone to transfer £50 Stock in the New Three and a Half per Cents standing in the names of John Clater and Robert Thomas Wood—that was in the morning—I cannot exactly say what time the transfer took place—about twelve o clock perhaps—I received the instructions about an hour before—I prepared this note looking at one from instructions given me by Clater Cross-examined Q How many times did you see the person you believe to be Olley with Clater A Six or seven times—I did express a doubt about his being the man—I have not seen him since October 1836 to my knowledge—he was shabbily and dirtily dressed—I cannot recollect what sort of clothes he had on—he was with me four or five minutes on each occasion—I have not said the person who came had red whiskers—I have no recollection of any thing of the kind—I cannot swear I have not said so—I should say I have not said the person was marked with the small-pox—but I had rather not swear I have not said so JACOB CARR I am clerk to Mr Hawkins I went with the two prisoners to transfer some stock in the Three and a Half per Cents—I think I went with them seven times to sell stock—I went to identify them—I am sure they are the persons I went to identify the morning they were in custody—I had some doubt when I first saw Olley but when I came to look at him I had no doubt—I went with them to the Bank on the 26th of October 1836 and transferred the sum of £50 being the whole of the stock remaining—they then assumed the joint names of John Clater and Robert Thomas Wood Cross-examined Q Where was Olley when you first saw him in custody A Passing before us in the street going to the Mansion-house—Mr Hawkins was with me at the time—I did not hear Mr Hawkins say he had any doubt about him—I think I said at first that I had some doubt about him—I do not remember Mr Hawkins saying that he had too—I think he did say so just at first but I am not sure—the parties were about five minutes in my company on each occasion—the man who came with Clater was very shabbily and dirtily dressed—his clothes looked to me like dirty black but I will not swear it—I did not say I had some doubt about Olley being the man when I saw him up stairs in the Justice-room nor any thing of the kind—I told Mr Hawkins he was the man as we went up stairs—that was all that passed and when he saw him in the Justice-room he said he could swear to him—I did not describe his whiskers or say he was pock-marked MR ADOLPHUS Q Are you the attesting witness to this transfer A Yes I saw the parties sign it—I saw Olley write the name Robert Thomas Wood here JOHN JABEZ OVER I am a clerk in the Three and a Half per Cent Annuity office in the Bank—I prepared this transfer on the 26th of October in consequence of instructions I received from Skinner—it was completed from those instructions ROBERT THOMAS WOOD I am a printer s compositor and live in Henry-street Gray s Inn-lane—I know the prisoner Clater very well—I married his sister—he is the son of the late Mr Frederick Clater who died on the 18th of May 1882—he and his father were both druggists—after the father s death I and the prisoner acted as executors—I had a sum of 400l of his to call in—the whole of it was paid to the prisoner in my presence—100l of it was to be given to the widow of Mr F Clater and the other after paying the funeral and other expenses was to be invested in the funds—250l of it was afterwards invested—it was a good while before it was invested—I made frequent applications to Clater to have it invested and at last it was done—I never gave authority to anybody whatever in any way to transfer that stock—this transfer is in the hand-writing g of the prisoner Clater but the Robert Thomas Wood is not my handwriting—it is an imitation of it—I do not recollect receiving the dividends on the stock at first—they were paid over to Mrs Mary Clater the widow of the late Frederick Clater by the prisoner—I received one some time after and paid that over to her—I cannot recollect when that was—it is some time ago—250l stock was then standing in our joint names—I think it was on that sum I received the dividend—I should have known if any part of it was transferred—I signed this dividend-book looking at it when I received it—about the summer of 1835 I made an appointment with Clater to go to the Bank to receive the dividends on this stock—he was to meet me at a public-house in Coppice-row—I went there at the time appointed and waited about two hours—he did not come—I endeavoured on subsequent occasions to get him to go to the Bank with me to receive the dividend but could not get him to meet me—I at last applied to the Bank in the early part of this year and found the stock all sold—I caused application to be made to the Bank to restore it—the receipt to this dividend dated July 1834 is in my hand-writing Clater I never promised to meet him in Coppice-row—I met him when be lived in Corporation-row as he was removing and I said I would meet him the following day at his other residence Witness I do not recollect that—he did not meet me when he appointed Clater Q Did not I assist you in patting something into the cart when I spoke to you A I recollect your putting something into the cart but you did not go that day—you promised to meet me at Bennett s and when we did go to receive the dividend which I did receive we went from Bennett s SAMUEL THOMAS SMART I am in the counting-house of Williams Deacon and Co in Birchin-lane I paid this cheque— baking at it —I cannot tell who to—these are the notes it was paid in— looking at four notes JACOB CARR re-examined I paid for the stock by a cheque which I gave to John Clater ROBERT THOMAS WOOD re-examined Here is the hand-writing of Clater on the back of one of these four notes WILLIAM SUTHERLAND WOOD I am a chemist and druggist in Exmouth-street Spafields—I have known the prisoner Olley about three years and Clater eight or nine years—Clater rents premises of my father in Spafields to make up horse medicine—I often saw Olley and him together in business—he appeared to be assisting him and running errands for him—he often came to me to buy drugs for Clater—I am quite sure of his person—he was not dressed then as he is now—he was very shabby—he appeared to have very slight whiskers there and rather dark than light Cross-examined Q Is he a married man A I cannot say any thing about that—I have not known where he lived—no more than his being with Clater Clater s Defence Olley lived seven years in the house where I lived for twelve years at Wilson and Co s—I assure you he is not guilty of what he is charged with—Mr S Wood has said that he came from me—it is no such thing—he came to me and I recommended him to Mr Wood to get these articles and those were the only transactions I had with him—he did not go for goods for me HENRY M DONALD I am a licensed victualler and live in Milton-street St Luke s I have known the prisoner Olley from a child—he lived shopman with me seven years and bore the best of characters—he has lived in the same house for the last seven years with the people who took the house—he continued there up to the time of his being taken into custody—I know his hand-writing well—he has written two or three hundred names for me in one day when I carried on the pawnbroker s business—this signature Robert Thomas Wood is not at all like his writing in any way whatever— looking at the transfer Q Does that appear to you to be the free and natural hand-writing of a man or an attempt at disguise A I should say it is a free hand—his is a very stiff hand as he was in the habit when with a druggist of writing on parcels going into the country MR MAULE Q Was that shown to you at the police-office A It was—there were three shown to me—I did not then say it was a disguised hand—allow me to explain—I said when I saw it that it was not his handwriting—I saw the next and if you will show it me I will tell you it very different to that altogether—it seems written by a man very nervous—I said That looks like a woman s writing —another was then shown to me and I said I am satisfied that is not his hand-writing but a man might disguise his hand —the second did not look at all like the other but I cannot say they were done by different people—one signature appeared very different to the others—this is not it nor this— looking at two —I do not profess to be a judge of hand-writing—Olley was apprenticed to a druggist and I was apprenticed to his brother who is a pawnbroker—he was seven years in my employ at different times—I was a tailor and clothier at that time—in fact I kept a sale shop and sold every thing almost—I have been a publican going on five years—he has not been in my employ during the last three years not as a hired servant but he occasionally went on messages or did any thing for me—I never sent him to Clater—I did not know where Clater lived—I never sent him to buy any drugs—I do not know of his wanting any articles in Clater s line during the last three years MR JONES Q In the number of years you have known his handwriting was it generally uniform or did it vary A He wrote a stiff sort of hand and I should say it was all pretty well alike—I never knew him disguise his hand or attempt it TIMOTHY PERRY I am a clothes salesman and live in Golden-lane St Luke s I have known Olley about twenty years—he bore a good character—I have had opportunities of seeing his hand-writing—not very frequently—I bought goods of him perhaps five or six times—I have seen him write I dare say half a dozen times and have been able to form a judgment of the general character of his hand-writing—this signature Robert Thomas Wood is not at all like his hand-writing—I have been in the habit of seeing the writing of different persons in my business Q Does that appear to you the free unrestrained writing of a man or a disguised hand A I must admit this one appears to me rather disguised—it is not at all like Olley s writing—he writes a different character altogether—he has lived five years to my knowledge in his last place of abode—I saw him two or three times a week passing by my shop MR ADOLPHUS Q What business has he transacted with you when you saw him write A I bought some hats of him—he used to sell hats on commission for a Mr White—he made the bills out—I have seen him make them out in my shop four or five or half a dozen times and have seen him write his own name George Green Milton-street Finsbury Robert Shaw Wilmington-street Goswell-street Thomas Transfield Eagle Tavern City-road John Belstead Minories and John Bevan Leman-street gave

Bermondsey The prisoner came to our house about the beginning of August last—my husband was out—he asked for James Irwin—I told him my husband s name was William—I said his father s name was James but he had been dead some time—he told me there was a little money in France for us—I told him a little further respecting my husband s family and sent for my husband—when he came he gave him the same statement—he said he had come from his employer—he did not name Mr Fleury s name—I heard him afterwards name Mr Fleury as a person in Paris—he said it was 3000 francs for a debt owing to my husband in France—the debt was more than that but ray husband was to sell him the debt for that—he came again in September when my husband was out and said there was a little more to do before the money could be got that the two affidavits signed before must be signed again saying that he was the only heir and by the law of this country entitled to the property—he came again in March when my husband was out—I said my husband was going to write to Mr Fleury—on the 6th of March the day before the prisoner came we had received a letter—on my saying my husband was going to write to Mr Fleury I also said he intended to give the agreement to a friend who was going to France to take what steps he thought proper with Mr Fleury—he said he hoped my husband would not do such a thing as that it would be a great dishonour to Mr Fleury s character—he then said Mr Fleury had written to him three weeks back stating he would pay my husband interest from the 1st of October last and he said he hoped Mr Irwin would not write till he called again which would be on the Thursday or Saturday week following—he did not call again at our house at any time—he said nothing about the letter he had written to us before Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Were you examined befor the Lord Mayor A Yes—I did not sign any deposition—the prisoner was present when I was examined—I saw somebody writing—I do not need lect

the 26th or 27th of September rather better than three weeks after the prisoner called and said the same two affidavits must be signed again—I think I saw him once again after that—I got both these letten from him— looking at them —one is dated the 4th of August 1837—I have acted on the first letter and seen him on the subject of it—I believe the letter to be his hand-writing Cross-examined Q Did you ever see him write A I hare at my own house—on the 26th of October I saw him write EDWARD SPENCER I am an attorney I have been concerned for the prisoner in passing the Insolvent Court and have seen him write—I believe these two letters to be his hand-writing— read To Mr W Irwin —Lloyd s Royal Exchange Ang 4tb 1837 —Dear Sir —Your document will be ready for signature on Monday 12 o

tor do ALBERT DE TUE MR IRWIN He called at my house the day after that letter was sent but I did not see him—I waited until the 20th of March expecting him to come and then wrote to Mr Fleury at Paris and received an answer in consequence of which I went to the banking-house of Grote Prescott and Co —the endorsement on this bill of exchange— looking at it — Pass to the order of William Irwin is not my hand-writing—I gave nobody authority to do it—I did not know that there was such a bill in existence till I got a letter from Mr Fleury and went to Grote s—I never received a farthing of the money—I believe the endorsement Pass order of William Irwin to be the prisoner s writing Cross-examined Q How often have you seen him write A Once in October last—I have got his writing clear in my memory I recollect it well—if it were a hundred miles off and I was to look at it I should at once know it—if I was down at York and saw the paper there I would rear it was Mr De Tur s writing to the best of my belief MR BODKIN Q You took particular notice of his hand-writing A Yes and have had letters from him besides—if I saw the bill ia Yorkshire I should have the same belief MR PHILLIPS Q Had you known him long A Never tin that Iime—I never wrote any thing for him—I never wrote letters—I signed my name to the agreement—the W is like my hand-writing—there is nothing else a bit like it not a morsel like it EDWARD SPENCER re-examined The endorsement on the bill— looking at it —has every character of being the prisoner s hand-writing and the signature underneath is undoubtedly his hand-writing MR PHILLIPS Q Is it from acting as attorney for this man that you have seen him write A Yes—he never passed the Insoltent Court but filed a petition—he settled with his detaining creditor—I have seen him write many times JOHN CRITED I am acquainted with the French language—the translation of the first indorsement on this bill is— Pay to order of William Irwin value for the account of the price of the debt he has ceded to me in France 20th October 1837 L Fleury The bill was here read and toot for 118l 9s 6d at three days after date payable to order of L Fleury HENRY GEOROB CHAPMAN I am one of the principal cashiers of the house of Messrs Grote Prescott and Co — looking at the bill —I remember this being presented on the 4th of November—I believe the endorsement was the same as the one on it now—I paid the amount with five £10 notes Nos 17551 to 17555 dated 5th October 1837 ten £5 notes Not 39135 to 39144 dated 3rd October 1837 and 18l 9s 6d in money—I believe these three notes looking at them to be the same as I paid away on the 4th of November—they correspond in number and date—from the entry in my book I should think it must have been about half-past eleven o clock when the bill was presented Cross-examined Q Have you any recollection who presented it A I have not—I do not know one Urquart—I was at the Mansion-house—the prisoner was pointed out to me—I was asked if he was the person and I had no recollection of him—I cannot identify him MR DOANE Q How many months after the 4th of November did you see him A Five or six months WILLIAM HENRY MEAGLE I am in the employ of William Masters a pawnbroker living in Jermyn-street S James s The prisoner pawned some articles at our shop— looking at the three notes —these have my

DAWSON I live at No 4 Ann-street Wilmington-square I did live at No 2 Oddy s-row Islington-green-about a year and nine months ago I saw an advertisement in the Times newspaper-in consequence of which I went to No 3 Jewin-court Jewin-street—I there saw the prisoner—I said I called in reference to an advertisement I had seen in the paper stating that money was to be obtained on freehold property life Interest &c —inquired for J Pepper Esq —the prisoner said I am the principal—I caused the advertisement in the paper—I do business in that way walk in —I went in—he inquired the nature of the property which I described as a manor farm and land situated at Wadsworth in the west Riding of York—I told him I had a quarter share at the death of my father who was aged sixty-four or sixty-five—he inquired the sum I wanted—I told him 150l —he said he had no doubt he could obtain that sum for me—he said he had clients making use of their names living at Ips wich who would purchase the property and he had no doubt they would give me that sum—he desired me to call again in a few days—I did so and saw him—he said he had seen his clients and that he could not give me that but he would give me 100l which I agreed to—he said he would give it me part in money and part in a bill at two months—I agreed to that and left—I was desired to call again which I did a few days afterwards—he then said he had heard from his clients who not having any money at their command would give me a 100l bill or two 50l bills—that was the third time I called which was about a week or a fortnight after the second time—I agreed to take two 50l bills—he did not give me them on that occasion—on the next visit to Jewin-street which was the latter part of November when I went into the front-parlour or office I saw two bills lying on the table—the prisoner then said I have received the bills from my clients in the country meaning Ipswich—he produced them—they were ready prepared with the exception of my signature as the drawer on the supposed acceptor—this is one of the bills he so produced— looking at one —I looked at them—I inquired who this Nicholson and Co the acceptor was and what they were—he told me they were merchants—I inquired what merchants—he answered general merchants and that they resided at Ipswich and were highly respectable men and the bills would be paid on the day they were due—there was no address on the bill but 3 Jewin-court Jewin-street as their address—I inquired how I was that the address was Jewin-court when he had just informed me they lived at Ipswich—he said they lived at Ipswich and they would be in town and the bills would be paid at Praed and Co bankers Fleet-street where they were made payable—he then brought the bills from the front parlour to the back where I saw Mr Adolphus Warres Attorney at Law and Mr Lewis the clerk—the latter two persons left the back and went into the front parlour and the prisoner brought the two bills to me and laying them on the table said Put your name there as the drawer —I did so—we then went into the front parlour where I saw a parchment lying on the table-when we went in the two persons left and went into the back parlour—they were then called into the front parlour—I then signed the said deed or parchment—one deed and a memorial—they were not read over to me before I signed them nor was I asked to have them read—after I had signed the bills were delivered to me by the prisoner in the presence of the two other persons—he said when he delivered them to me Now here are two bills as good as the Bank of England and that they would be paid on the day they were due—the prisoner and myself then returned into the back parlour again and after that he took a sovereign out of his pocket saying I will lend you this out of my pocket which you can repay me when the bills are met —that was in the back parlour—we then went to a public-house at the corner of Jewin-street where we had some refreshment for which the prisoner paid—he then named about the bills being good and not to go and fool them away for they were as good as the Bank of England-when the bills became due I presented them at Praed and Co s but they were not paid—consequence of that I called on the prisoner on my way home and saw him—I told him they were not paid- Oh he said my dear fellow they will be paid there is three days grace allowed on all bills —I went three days afterwards and they were not paid then—I went to the prisoner again—he told me his clients were then in the country but would he shortly in town when the bills would be paid—I called repeatedly afterwards and saw the prisoner repeatedly at the public-house—he always made some frivolous excuse saying his clients would be shortly in town and the bills would be paid and so forth—I shortly afterwards gave him to custody Q In the course of your visits to the prisoner did you ever see Mr pepper A Never only since I have been here— looking at the deed —this is the deed I signed and this is my signature for the money Q This signature is for 298l A Yes—I was not aware at the time I signed it that it was for more than 100l —this is the memorial which I signed—I never received one farthing in consideration only the two bills I have mentioned Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Mr Dawson you have never been asked who you are or how you get your living A I am I believe what is termed a gentleman though a little reduced perhaps—I do not live with my family—I have ceased to do so some time—I am at my father s almost every day—I presume Mr Clarkson this has nothing to do with the inquiry—I have lived away from my family about a twelvemonth—I have lived there on and off—sometimes I am there and sometimes not—the last time was about two months—I have slept there within less than two months ago—my father lives at No 2 Oddy s-row Islington-green—I now live at No 4 Ann-street Wilmington-square—I have lived here about five or six weeks-before that I lived in Wood-street Old-Street-road and several places—I lived in Northampton-street Northampon-square before I went to Ann-street—I went from there to Ann-street-occupied a back parlour in Ann-street—the landlady s name was Miss o Brien—she is a single woman to the best of my knowledge between twenty and thirty years old—I have known her ever since I have been in the house not before Q What rent do you pay A Am I bound to answer that question —well I will satisfy you-3s 6d a week latterly but it was more before-Ebbs was my landlord before I went to Ann-street—I am not a married man—I do not live alone—I live with a lady who has been some time under my protection—I have supported her as my wife—she is as virtuous to me as if you have a wife your wife is to you—it is not Miss O Brien—I lived in the back parlour in Northampton-street—I lived there a fortnight—I lived in Queen-street Northampton-square before I went there—that is the next street I think—I lived there about two days-allow me to say I paid my way-before I went to Queen-street I lived in Popham-street Lower-road Islington—I lived there I think as hear as I can guess about six or seven weeks or it might be two months or ten weeks—I was a lodger there-before that I lodged at Mr Baker s No 7 East-street Hoxton Old Town—I lived there about the same time-eight or ten weeks-before I lived at Mr Baker s I lodged in wood-street Old-street-road—I had one room—I lived about eight or nine months there-before that I lodged at No 8 Paul-street Finsbury between two and three months and with the same landlady as I lived with in Wood-street—she left one house and I moved with her to the other—I went by the name of Dawson—I never went by any other name—I have never taken apartments in any other name—I always went in my own name—I shall not answer your question Q What means had you of living from the time yon went to parl-street up to your coming to Ann-street A That which was afforded me by my father—I told you my father supported me in the first instance—that is the way in which I got and still get my living—the only way—I do not get it in a dishonest way—I get it only by support I have from my father—I do not get it by any sort of work—I live by my father s support alone Q Have you ever had money from the prisoner A Money has passed between our hands Do you mean as consideration or what different sums have passed sometimes a sovereign at a time sometimes half and sometimes less-never more-altogether I suppose I have received between 7l or 8l from the prisoner—I will swear I have not received above 100l —a sovereign is the largest sum I have received at one time—I have had a sovereign once or twice—I will swear I have not received 10l from him—I have given a signature for every sum I have received—I will swear positively that I have not had more than 10l altogether from him-when I saw him the first time I asked him if he was Mr Pepper—he said No I am the principal—I caused the insertion in the paper -when I asked him if his name was Pepper he said in an off-hand way between yes and no Walk in I am the principal —I believed he was Mr Pepper-when I asked him he said No Q Did you give the prisoner authority to put up this property by public auction A I did—I first saw the prisoner in October or November last twelvemonth about that time—I cannot tell what month it was in—I unfortunately kept no memorandum of these transactions—I have other property besides this coming to me at the death of my father reversionary property—I do not live in a secluded way—I have played and believe all of us have more or less—I think you are playing on my feelings now—I do not feel myself bound to answer whether I have played a good deal—I am twenty-nine years of age—I don t feel myself bound to tell you when I left my father s roof Q I think I understand you to say you put your name to the deed and a receipt for 298l without reading it A I did not know the sum I put my name to—I supposed it was 100l —I never saw the consideration money—I could have read the figures but I did not observe them—I don t believe the figures were there—they could be added after-Warren and Lewis were present when I put my name to it—I do not feel myself bound to tell you whether I applied to anybody else to dispose of the property now how many persons I applied to or how many persons I unsuccessfully applied to—I do not know who furnished the prisoner with the schedule of the land—he has been up to my father s and he has a plan of the estate—he has been once to my father s—my father knew I was about getting money on the property COURT Q Did your father know you were about getting money through the prisoner A He did MR CLARKSON Q Did your father ever go to the prisoner with you A Never—I did not observe the date of the deed at the time I signed it—it was about the 5th of December—I was in distress—I wished for something more than I had—I should have paid my debts when I obtained the money—it was for the purpose of paying my debts I borrowed the money—they were debts part contracted for lodging and part for rent—I not feel myself bound to tell the amount of my debts—they were partly or rent to my different landlords and landladies Q I forget how long it is since you swore you always paid your way I said from Queen-street where I only staid two days—I paid my say for two days—I do not feel myself bound to say how many lodgings have gone away from without paying my rent—I will not answer—after executing the deed I only received these papers which are no use to me and how could it pay several pounds which I was in debt —I do not feel would to say how many pounds I was in debt—I have always endeavoured pay my way—my circumstances have remained the same since I executed the deed as before—I was pressed for money at that time—I put my name as drawer to these bills on the day I signed the deed—I read the bills and asked several questions about them—I took particular notice of them—they were dated November 23rd-when I signed the deed I did not exactly notice the date of it—I was not aware of the date of the deed till I saw it at Hatton Garden-had I known the day on which I signed the deed was the 5th of December I should then have made more inquiry respecting the date of the bills being the 23rd of November—I believe I executed the deed about the 5th of December—I signed the bills the same day I received them—that was the day I executed the deed-as I said before the deed not having been read over I did not know whether it did not bear the same date as the bills—I first went to Praed s banking-house on the 21st or 22nd of January last and I went the second time three days after—I think the first time was on Monday and Thursday was the second time Q Did you ever go to see Mr Crook the auctioneer to see if he could sell the property A Yes-being recommended by the prisoner—I went once to Mr Crook—I do not remember whether that was in October last year—I made one application to get the bills discounted—I cannot exactly state the person s name to whom I applied but he resides in a turning out of Holborn—I did not see him before I went to him for that purpose—I have seen him since passing by—I do not know the name of the court—it is a turning leading into Lincolns -inn-fields—it is in Turnstile—it is a tailor s shop—it was a young man in the shop I went to—I cannot positively say whether he was the master or the foreman—I was not referred to that young man by any one—I suppose it was some little time after I took the bills that I went—I cannot say how soon after—I have applied to somebody else—I cannot exactly recollect the day I went to the person to discount the bills—it was not a month after I signed them—I cannot answer whether it was a fortnight or a week it was under a month—I cannot say nearer—it was not a person I knew Q How came you to go to him A I was promiscuously passing by and saw the party there—I went into the shop and asked him to discount the bills—the tailor s shop—I inquired if they did business in that way—He was the door and asked if I wished to buy any thing—I said I am not in want of any thing at present but have you plenty of money in the house —he said Yes I have a little I have got enough for you how much do you want —I said Why I only want a hundred a couple of fifties and there is something for you to laugh at—I said if he had money in the house as he said he had I would have no objection to take a coat and trowsers or so if he would discount these bills—he said if the bills were good he would do them for me—I do not recollect what name was over the door—I did not particularly observe the name—I never noticed and I did not ask him his name not till I went again-of course I went again—I never saw the man till I went the first time—he asked me to take a dress—I said I have no objection to take an article or two I am not particular to 10l or 15l or so —he said If the bills are good I will do them with pleasure and if they are good you can have the money to-night —this was Saturday afternoon—I never saw him afterwards on business—I might have met him promiscuously—I never saw him but that once to be in his company that I am aware of—I do not remember whether I went to the house again the same night—he said it the bills were good he would do them-another party came up stairs into the shop—the young man who had taken the bills of me passed them into his hands to take down the particulars the names and amounts and he was going down to the kitchen or cellar which he had come from with the bills Q Was this the first time or the second A I only called once—I said the bills were good and I also said as the prisoner told me repeatedly that they were as good as the Bank of England—it was my firm belief then that they were not knowing any thing about the prisoner I took him for a gentleman—I had got the bills in my pocket—I had been walking about to call at one place or another—the party was about taking them down into the cellar to take the particulars of them but being a little doubtful not having been in the shop before and not knowing any thing of them I said Can t you take down the particulars before my sight —I did not like the sight of the stairs being very dark—I was a little doubtful of the appearance of the place he was going to and of the security of my bills and I might speak a little firm to him—he went down a few steps—the other called him up and said Come up here the gentleman is doubtful about the bills—he is fearful you are going to run away with them —he said Oh here are your bills —I wanted the money and rather regretted being so sharp with him—I said I am very sorry I have offended you I merely said to this gentleman Why can t you take down the particulars before me as well as taking them down stairs —he would have no more to say to me and put them down—after talking to the other one I said I am very sorry I have offended you if you will do them I will give you a certain remuneration and I should like them done as soon as possible —he said No I decline them if I had done them you would have had the money to-night but I decline them altogether —I said Oh the fact is this you have not so much in the house and you will not do them and put me of with an excuse because I spoke so sharp about them —he would not cash them—I became vexed at my hastiness and endeavoured to urge him to do them and said I would give him remuneration—I cannot tell what month this was in—I did not ask his name-if he had taken down the particulars before me I should then have said To whom do I entrust these bills for discount —or in other words ask his name but he did not take the particulars—I recollect making another application to get the bills discounted—that was before the bills became due—it was not a month after the first application—I did not say that it was—I said it was under a month—it was not a week after the first—I made the second application to a society—I think the Economic or London Discount Society opposite Marlborough-street—that was in the month of January soon after the beginning-about the first week or first week and a half—I made no other application—I do not remember making any other—I decline swearing it—I might have applied to one more to a man I think in the same business-a clothes-dealer a tailor or draper somewhere down Houndsditch—I do not know what number and I forget the name—I was inquiring in the street as I went along and a young man met me and referred me to the opposite corner as a party who did business in that way namely discounting bills—I was going over to the corner shop and a young man at the door asked if I wanted to buy any thing and I said as I did to the first If you will discount a bill I have no objection to purchase to a small amount —I do not Know the name of the street it was at the corner of—I said it was two £50 bills I had—I do not know the name of the street but I could find it—I do not know the man s name—I have heard it but I forget it—the young man referred me to next door and gave me the name but I forget it I went to the next door the same day—that was a day or two after—I applied the first time at the other place in Great Marlborough-street—I do not remember applying to anybody after that—I can swear I did not to any one else—I am sure of that—I did not go to Praed s banking-house before the bills were due to inquire about Nicholson—I took the prisoner s words—he said they were highly respectable general merchants Q On your oath were not these accommodation-bills given to you to raise money on till the property could be sold A No they were given as a consideration for 100l —I got a sovereign from the prisoner the day I signed the deed—it was one year and four or five months after I first saw the prisoner that I got the bills—I had not got money from him in the mean time-just before I got the bills there was a trifle between us lent by way of loan out of his pocket—it was 14s 9d or somewhere about that and there was 10s charged extra for two advertisements making 1l 4s 9d —I did not write to Ipswich before I took the bills to inquire if Nicholsons were respectable—I did not get the bills noted when they were not paid Q How lately before you caused the prisoner to be taken up did you go to him and ask him for money A Within a fortnight-within ten or eleven days—I did not ask him for money the last time but within a fortnight I did—I asked him to lend me a trifle more till the bills were paid—I could not find Nicholson—he was always putting me off Q Did you not tell the prisoner at that time that you were in such a state of poverty you had not the means of finding yourself a lodging and get 5s from him to procure it A I might have told him so having been put off so long not receiving remuneration for my property and I wanted to get what I could—I decline saying how often I have been in gambling-houses or whether I lost my money in gambling-houses—I decline saying whether I had been a hundred times in gambling-houses since the 5th of December 1837 and I deny it too—I never proposed to keep a house of ill-fame—on the solemn oath I have taken I never did but the prisoner suggested it to me Q On your oath did not you tell the prisoner you wanted to raise money on this property—that you were living with a woman who kept a b-y-house and could make 7l a week by it and that was why you wanted the money A On my oath I deny it—I have not bought any furniture since I got these bills—I decline saying whether I have tried to get any body to let me have any PHILIP COTTON I am clerk in Messrs Praed s banking-house There is no firm of Nicholson and Co s bank at our house nor any person of the name of Nicholson—I do not know the signature to this acceptance— looking at the bill Cross-examined Q If anybody had applied to you during the running of that bill as to information about Nicholson of Ipswich you would have told them you had no such customers A Certainly JOHN PEPPER I live at No 2 Brewer-street Pimlico and am an attorney—I had formerly an office at No 3 Jewin-court for a short time The prisoner was at that time in my service as clerk—I left there about June 1837—I never authorised him to insert any advertisement in the paper to raise money in my name Cross-examined Q Has it happened to you that persons have been in the habit of practising as attorneys in your name A I do not understand your question—there are none in the profession that practise in my name that I know of—I swear that—I never permitted any persons to practise as attorneys in my name—I never knew of it—I never participated in any profits of a person practising as an attorney in my name—I never shared the profits of my business as an attorney with any person not an attorney—I swear that—I never took any money from any person for business done in my name as an attorney to my knowledge—I never received payment for business done of which I had no knowledge—I was about twelve months in Jewin-court—I did not live there—I lived at Brompton and had an office there—I had an office at that time at Hull in Yorkshire-nowhere else—I conducted the business at Hull myself with the assistance of a clerk named Fenwick—I have a certificate as an attorney—I always take out my certificate regularly—my name was not over the door in Jewin-street—my name was in the master s book—it was not in the Law List for 1837 because it was taken out after January—I believe it was taken out in February 1837 by the prisoner as my clerk—I am not aware that he paid for my certificate with his own money—I understood from him it was taken out with money he stated he had received on account of my business—I do not know from whom—my certificate is not taken out this year—I have been regular in taking it out every year I have been in business—it will be taken out this year—I never omitted taking it out Q Why not take ft out this year A That is a question for my own consideration—I took it out myself in 1836 with my own hand and also in 1835 and every year besides 1837—I took it out myself since I have practised in town which has been six or seven years—I do not know who the house in Jewin-court belongs to—the prisoner was the housekeeper there—I knew him as housekeeper there about a couple of months before I took an office there—I did not pay him rent or a salary—the principal consideration with me was to have an office free of any charge—he was paid from certain profits arising out of any business he could procure—he received the whole of the profits of any business he could get except the 12l for my certificate-an arrangement was made when I went there that he was to receive two-thirds of the profits and I one-third but that was never carried into effect—there was nobody else with whom I made the same arrangement nor ever has been—I have never had any account of business from the prisoner—I have asked him for one but he always put me off and never furnished it—he was at liberty to bring all the business he could to the office—I do not read any one newspaper in particular—I did not remove the office furniture when I went away—I never had any there—I never had any other clerk there—there was a clerk there named Lewis—I believe Rogers paid him—I did not—there was nobody else—I never knew anybody else there—my object was to have the use of the room to carry on my Professional business—I did carry on my business there—the agreement was that I should have the room to carry on my professional business in and the prisoner act in my name and receive two-thirds and I one-third on his accounting to me for all business brought to the office—there was no undertaking for the prisoner to pay for the certificate—there are books of account I believe at the office which were kept by the prisoner and most probably bills of costs and drafts of proceedings Q On your solemn oath have you removed a single article draft paper or writing of any kind A Yes the papers which belonged to myself relating to my private business—I have no knowledge of the draft of this deed—I do not recollect the last time I was at the office before the prisoner was taken into custody—I might have been there in January last and probably in February-not in March April or May—I think I called in March for some papers he had belonging to a client of mine—I will swear I was not there more than twice in March—I have called about twice within this twelvemonth—I do not believe I was there in February—I will not swear it—I do not recollect whether I was there in January—I will not swear I was not—I was very probably there in December 1837—I will swear I was not there in November 1837—I have lived in Brewer-street Pimlico-since I left the prisoner s office I have removed my office to Pimlico and have no office in town—I lived at Brompton I believe seven or eight months—I lived at Chelsea four years before that and before that I lived in the neighbourhood of Chelsea—I have had about four different residences within the last five years—I will swear I have not had twice as many—I lived at Southampton in 1829—I was an attorney there—it is nine years ago—I have had about four residences since that-not half-a-dozen-Blunden Spinks and Co are my agents at Southampton THOMAS STOCKINGS I am a saddler and live in St Peter s parish Ipswich I have lived there twenty years—I have seen the prisoner at Ipswich two or three times—I saw him there about twelve months ago at an inn—I am well acquainted with the town and neighbourhood of Ipswich—I know nothing of any firm of the name of Thomas Nicholson and Co general merchants there—there is no such firm there—I have made inquiry of the tax-collector and at the Post Office and have not been able to find any such firm—I have not been able to find any general merchant of the name of Nicholson JOHN HILL I am clerk to Collis Smith and Co attorneys and solicitors New-square Lincoln s-inn I have produced the memorial and deed—I received them from the prisoner on the 10th or 11th of January last as collateral security for a joint note of hand for 100l to enable a person of the name of Lane to take a public-house—the prisoner became joint security JOHN PEPPER re-examined I know the prisoner s hand-writing—the whole of the writing of the body of this bill is his—the acceptance is not JESSE COAL I am an attorney Looking at the bill —I am not sufficiently cognisant with the hand-writing of Mr Nicholson to be able to swear this is his—I know a party of the name of Nicholson—I forget his Christian name but I think it is Thomas—the prisoner was articled to me—I only know Nicholson through the introduction of the prisoner—I at that time lived in Welbeck-strect London—I think in the year 1832 a man of the name of Nicholson came to me on the recommendation of the prisoner and employed me to issue a writ for him against a man named Payne—I have see him frequently since about the Judges chambers at Sergeant s-inn—I believe he employs himself to make affidavits just to suit any purpose which may be required—I was never at Ipswich—my opinion is if that be the same man he is capable of any species of fraud that may be devised—I do not know of his carrying on business at Ipswich as a merchant nor of his being in any firm in fact I should not have been concerned for him if I had known his character—I do not believe this acceptance is the hand-writing of that Nicholson—I will not positively swear it is not—the man made an affidavit to hold another party to bail and I have seen his writing but should not recollect it—I cannot say positively one way or the other—I do not believe that I said before the Magistrate I believed it was his writing—I believe my deposition was taken—I swore that it was not Rogers writing-to the best of my belief I did not state it was Nicholson s hand-writing—I do not believe I could have said it COURT Q You said you were an attorney have you got your certificate A I have not at present—I have not taken it out this twelvemonth—I am nominally on the roll—I have not been struck off—I am at this time applying for re-admission—I was opposed by an affidavit of the prisoner which was full of perjury—I was opposed by the law Society—the affidavit is before Mr Justice Coleridge Witnesses for the Defence JOHN LEWIS I live in Charlotte-court Redcross-street Cripplegate I was clerk to Mr Pepper—I left him on the 3rd of February this year He was occasionally in the habit of coming to the office up to that time but not often—I know the prisoner very well and I also know the prosecutor—I have seen him many times—I remember his coming to the office for the purpose of raising money on some property of his—I was in the habit of entering his name in the day-book—I know that Rogers has at various times advanced him various sums of money—I cannot tell to what amount—I cannot say I have seen him make advances but I have heard him ask for money-even in the absence of the prisoner he had often asked me if I could lend him 1s or 2s —I know Thomas Nicholson very well—I cannot say that I have seen him write—I have not seen writing of his that I have acted on—I never saw his writing—I have seen him at the prisoner s office many times—I have heard from the prisoner or prosecutor that he had the acceptance of Nicholson—I will not be positive whether Nicholson has ever been in the office when the prosecutor has been there—I knew from the prosecutor that he had accommodation bills from the prisoner MR CLARKSON to JOHN DAWSON Q Did you ever tell that man Lewis or saw in his presence that you had two accommodation bills of Nicholson s from the prisoner A Never—I told him I had two bills drawn on and accepted by T Nicholson and Co and that is all I said that I had two bills but not as accommodation JOHN LEWIS re-examined Q Did you ever hear from the prosecutor at he had two accommodation acceptances of Nicholson s from the prisoner A Yes I witnessed the execution of this deed by the prosecuter— looking at it —I believe these large figures 298 were there when put his name to it—I have no reason to think they have been put there since—I saw him execute the deed—the property was advertised for sale—I quitted Jewin-court on the 3rd of February last—I have never been business there since—I do not remember ever seeing Nicholson write-saw him last Friday evening—I served him with a subpoena at No 57 castle-street Leicester-square at a butcher s shop of the name of Bustini-had been for days and nights there watching for him before I could serve him—I had made efforts to see him before—I saw him three times before at but could never get him to take the subpoena nor did he take it then was obliged to leave it on the butcher s block for him—Mr Mead was with me to see the service of it—I have known Nicholson about three years MR CHAMBERS Q Do I understand you to say the prosecutor told you he had two accommodation acceptances A Yes the impression on my mind is that he used the word accommodation Q Now in the hearing of the Jury when out of the Witness-box did not you say he did not use the word accommodation while Dawson was being hamined A What I said I believe was I am not positive it was accommodation —I am not positive he used the word accommodation—I have been in the same office with the prisoner three years—I was Mr pepper s clerk—the prisoner was Mr Pepper s managing-clerk—I do not know whether I was the prisoner s clerk—he did not practise for himself—I was under his directions and suppose he was under Mr Pepper—I was at the prisoner s house before Mr Pepper had anything to do with him—I was there when the prisoner practised for Mr Warren—I was under he prisoner up to January 1836—I was under him from March 30th 835—I was under Mr Warren and the business was done in Mr Warren s name—he is an attorney Q Before you went to Mr Warren how did you get your living A was a draper originally—I was not a draper when I went to Mr Warren 1835—I had been a publican previous to that in 1833—I had been doing nothing particular in those two years—I got my living on my own property-means I have got myself—I have got property in Tenby in Wales—it is my daughter s and she assists me with money when I want it—have no property of my own—I did not live wholly upon my daughter s assistance from 1833 to 1835—I got assistance from my friends in one way or another-when I was a publican I kept the Three Tuns in Brook-street lost the licence as I was absent from home and some improper person insulted Mr Laing of Hatton Garden—I do not know whether they were pickpockets but I was told so and the licensing day being very handy Mr Laing stopped the licence—I ceased to be a draper in 1816 when I was obliged to compound with my creditors WILLIAM MEAD I am a farmer but have not been in business for some time I lived at Ipswich—I know Thomas Nicholson—I have seen him Write—I believe this acceptance to be his—I saw him write at the Bull in Jewin-crescent—I cannot say what he was writing—I know Henry May—I saw him serve that same Nicholson with a subpoena on the 10th of July last at a quarter to ten o clock at night—I have heard that Nicholson lived in White Lion-street but he was served at No 10 Leicester-square—I cannot say whether that is a gambling-house—I afterward went with Mr Lewis to serve him with a subpoena to attend this Sessions—I saw him then at the same place—we were waiting sometimes two hours sometimes three and sometimes four hours before we could get an opportunity of serving him—we were there at night as well as day—we served him in a butcher s shop in Castle-street on the 17th of this month—we had been looking for him two hours that night and frequently day after day on the 21st and 24th of July and the 3rd and 17th of August—I have known Nicholson since the autumn of last year MR CHAMBERS Q When was it you saw Nicholson write A cannot say the day of the month—it was in the autumn of lost year a some time about November at the Bull in Jewin-crescent—the prisoner was there—I went there to take a glass of brandy and water with the prisoner—I only saw him write that time—he was writing on a sheet of paper-what it was I do not know—I did not read what he wrote and never saw it afterwards—it was at No 16 Leicester-square we served the subpoena inside the back gate

payment of money MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution ANN ROUGH I keep the Bell Tavern Bell-yard Gracechurch-street On the 12th of July the prisoner came to my house between three and four o clock as near as I can tell and asked for the parlour—he was shown into the parlour—he asked for a pint of beer which he had—he then asked if we had an ordinary—I said it was over—he had some refreshment and after that as his cloth was being cleared away he asked if I knew of a respectable young man to go with a bill—I went and informed my son and when my son came in I said This child is my son he will go for yon —he said It is to go to Mr Masterman s the banker s -when I heard the name of Masterman Mr Rough knew him so well I did not hesitate about his going—I said to my son John the gentleman wants you to take a bill to Masterman s do you know where it is —he said Yes —the prisoner said You are to bring me back 75l —I said John mind what you are about for you are going to receive money - he gave him a letter asked for pen and ink and wrote his name on a card and my son went taking the card and the letter—after he was gone the prisoner asked me if I had a back yard—I told him no—he went up stairs returned down again went to the door returned and said I want to go about forty paces and if your son returns before I do I leave you in care of the money —he then left the house—my son returned while he was out—he came into the yard about seven o clock in the evening—my son saw him and they both came into the house together and shortly after he was taken into custody Cross-examined by MR ESPINASSE Q This as on the 12th of July A I think it was FREDERICK JOHN HULHE I was sent by the prisoner to Masterman s the banker s with this letter and card— looking at them —I went straight to Masterman s and presented this letter and card to a gentleman in the country office—the prisoner did not tell me to go to any office but that was the office straight forwards—some questions were asked me by a gentleman there and I came away without any money-when I got back the prisoner was gone—I saw him again about six or seven o clock in the yard—he came up to me touched me on the shoulder and asked whether I had got the money—I told him to come in doors with me—I had been told what to do if I saw him—he came in with me—I did not tell him any thing that had happened at the banking-house—he was afterwards taken into custody GEORGE FAIRBANKS I am one of the clerks at Messrs Masterman s banking-house there are six partners Mr William Masterman is the principal—on the 12th of July the last witness came to the banking-house and presented this bill—it was wafered and directed to the house-being so I handed it to Mr Peile who sat near me with the card and he opened it in my presence JOSEPH PEILE I am principal corresponding clerk in the country office at Messrs Masterman s Mr Fairbanks showed me that letter and card—on opening it I declined paying it being convinced at once that it was a forgery—I made some inquiries of the little boy—the firm of James Holmes and Son of Douglas Isle of Man Bank have an account with us JAMES HOLMES I am a banker in the Isle of Man James Holmes and Son is the firm—there are two other share-banks there but no other back of the name of Holmes on the island— looking at the forged instrument —this is not my writing-Idid not know any thing of it till I saw it at the Mansion House—there is a person named Kissack in the Isle of Man—he is a diffirent person to the prisoner—I did not know the prisoner at all—there are several brothers named Kissack in Douglas—I do not know their Christian names—the prisoner is not any one of them—I received this envelope and these three letters Nos 1 2 and 3 from one of the Kissack s at Douglas—he brought them to me-and this letter No 4 addressed to myself I received in the course of post ROMAL ALPHONSUS MALLAM I know the prisoner—I have seen him write—I believe these three letters 1 2 and 3 to be his hand-writing—I find some small writing on this envelope which I recognise and believe to be his—the large round hand I cannot recognise—I believe this other letter No 4 also to be his COURT Q How long have you known the prisoner A He came to me about the middle of April 1837 I believe two days after Good Friday with a letter of introduction from a young man I was acquainted with in Leeds—I was then living at Huddersfield—he remained in Huddersfield I believe for three or four months—after that he went on a journey of pleasure as he told me to the Isle of Man-and as we had been rather intimate during the time we had lived together in the same town he wrote to me from the Isle of Man which letter I received but did not answer-shortly after his return from the Isle of Man he went to Newark from which place I also received two or three letters from him consequently I am well able to judge of his hand-writing The bill and letters were here read as follows - Douglas Isle of Man Bank July 1st 1838 Due July 23rd Twenty-one days after date pay to our order to Edward Kissack or bearer the sum of seventy-five pounds sterling for value received JAMES HOLMES AND CO Payable at Messrs Masterman and Co Under this order upon the same sheet of paper was written as follows - Messrs Masterman Peters and Co Gentlemen-You will greatly oblige by cashing the

day you arrived safe home What a jovial spree we had I never shall forget such a one I am very glad I have left the island for of all the places it astonishes all both for scandal and every thing that

18 1838 GENTLEMEN—I received a letter from Mr E Kissack on Tuesday morning dated the 16th informing me he was placed in confinement upon a charge of forgery by you for presenting a bill for 75l drawn by me and made payable at your bank You will allow me Gentlemen to inform you that the above order for 75l is drawn up by me and was presented by me to his own brother George Kissack in Douglas to be forwarded to him Edward in London dated the 1st of July and I here declare before you that it is far from being a forgery and my opinion is that he is a young man that would not be guilty of any such crime I am very very sorry when I heard of this and I am surprised you would take it upon yourselves to apprehend him so suddenly without acquainting me with a letter to know if all is correct or not I hope Gentlemen for the sake of myself and the respectability of their family which for the last twenty years me and my brother Henry has been acquainted with them that you will immediately after you receive this go to the Magistrates and get him liberated immediately from that dreadful punishment It is a matter of impossibility for him to forge such a thing as that How was he to know that I had any connexion with your bank You have now detained him a week past the time he ought to have been at home on Friday last Consider he was sent from here to London to transact business for his uncle Mr Jackson who is a wholesale linen-draper &c I trust and hope you will most handsomely compensate him for this usage and I particularly request you will cash him the order for 75l immediately he is at liberty and place the same to my account likewise the charge for discounting you may charge him accordingly I remain Gentlemen yours very truly JAMES HOLMES P S —As soon as you have got him liberated and given him the cash for my bill please to write to me immediately afterwards To Messrs Masterman Peters and Co No 3 Mr Edward Kissack Douglas July 17 1838 SIR-Yours was duly received on the 15th lam very sorry and struck with astonishment when I read the latter end of your letter and finding you are placed in prison for a charge of forgery laid against you by Messrs Masterman and Co respecting the bill which I myself gave to your brother for 75l payable at Messrs Masterman s bank You also inform me that they did not cash the above for you when presented I am afraid you did not go the correct way about it when you presented the above bill to them or otherwise they would not have objected to it however I am pleased you wrote to me otherwise the consequence might have been serious This is to give satisfaction to the Lord Mayor of London and other Magistrates that I declare the bill for 75l which you have presented to Messrs Masterman and Co is perfectly correct and my own hand-writing and can assure all there is no forgery in the case therefore I beg after the Lord Mayor and Magistrates have read this they will liberate you from prison and compensate you for detaining you so long a time I have wrote to Messrs Masterman and Co likewise requesting them to pay you the sum of 75l which should have been done before and I hope and trust you will immediately afterwards go and get your business finished and return here as soon as possible as your brother is waiting impatiently every day to see you I remain yours truly JAMES HOLMES To Mr Edward Kissack Jun Giltspur-strcet Compter Prison London No 4 Giltspur-street Compter July 30 38 SIR —I hope you will excuse me taking the liberty of writing to you after doing what I have done towards you in committing so base an action for forging an order for 75l upon you at Messrs Masterman and Co I trust and hope you will look over this as I am very very sorry for what I have done I am now undergoing a severe punishment of confinement for it which nearly breaks my heart I can assure you Sir I would not have done it only necessity compelled me I could not obtain a situation as I have tried and tried again during the time I have been in London but owing to it being too late in the season for my business a linendraper &c is the only cause I can obtain a most satisfactory reference from my last employer in Huddersfield Yorkshire with whom I lived as an assistant for a year and a half also I can obtain another one from my employer in Nottingham whom I served five years with as an apprentice Let me earnestly beg of you to look over this for my own credit sake and likewise for my dear mother who is heart-broken I am only a fatherless child and always been brought up respectable and with strict integrity I was very grieved on Saturday last when I appeared at the Mansion House before his Worship the Lord Mayor and found they had received a letter from you giving me such a bad character likewise a newspaper from you with my name published in a paragraph stating I was a notorious swindler and had deceived a great many people during the short time I was in Douglas I can assure you I am quite undeserving of such a character for I was only in the island for four months and I always kept myself respectable and steady I did not wrong only one person in Douglas and that was only for five pounds and I gave him security for the amount and had he behaved in a proper manner to me as he ought to have done I would not have left him in debt It is well known by a great many respectable people in the island the ill-treatment I received from him He would not give me time to settle with him or otherwise I would have been there now I only regret that ever I visited the place as the injury it has done me no person can ascertain like myself through nothing but their base slandering tongues And I trust you will not think me the character that the paper states I have fortunately by me now the receipts of bills for many pounds that I have paid there which they accuse me of and I am innocent I should have got my discharge on Saturday last had it not been for the newspaper giving me such a base character Unfortunately I now have to await my trial and most likely I shall get transported and that will break my friends hearts as well as my own Ten thousand pardons do I ask you and I beg forgiveness Do be so kind as not to come forward to prosecute me but write a letter to his Worship the Lord Mayor of London begging of him to show mercy towards me as I will for ever thank you and pray for your kindness This punishment will be a warning to me for my life and I will for ever after become respectable and gain a honest livelihood Take pity upon me if you please and write to the Mayor of London again Saturday next as I am tried that day I remain your obedient Servant EDWARD KISSACK I hope you will write by return of post to the Lord Mayor so as he may receive it on Saturday next which is the day of my trial begging of him to be merciful to me and I hope I will get off for a little imprisonment My friends have got two highly respectable gentlemen of London Sergeant Wilde M P and Charles Pearson Esq are the two persons they have spoken to Messrs Masterman and Co as to the respectability of our family and they from what I can learn will forgive me this time providing you do and I hope you will if you please I will promise you never to do the like again James Holmes Esq Douglas Isle of Man DANIEL FORRESTER I am a police officer of the City of London I took the prisoner into custody at the Bell Tavern—he was taken before the Lord Mayor—he requested time given him to write to his friends and time was given him MR HOLMES re-examined This letter purporting to be signed by me No 2 I know nothing whatever of—it was not signed by me or by my authority Charles Pearson Esq deposed to the prisoner s good character GUILTY Aged 20 — Transported for Fourteen Years

t18380820-2070  2070 JOHN FREDERICK BOX was indicted for feloniously forging and uttering a certain acquittance and receipt for the sum of 3l 14s with intent to defraud John Giles Pilcher and another WILLIAM THACKER I live in Willow-walk Orange-hill Bermondsey if he prisoner was my apprentice—I made out a bill to Messrs Pilcher of the organ s-lane for one dozen of half-firkin casks at 1s each and receipted the bill—that bill has been lost— looking at a bill —this is a copy of the one I wrote but no part of it whatever is my hand-writing—I believe it to be the prisoner s hand-writing—I have seen him write and from my knowledge of his writing I believe it to be his Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q When did you see him write A When he signed his indentures—I have compared it with his indentures that leads me to conclude it is his—I am a cooper by business COURT Q Have you kept your memory alive by looking at what you have seen him write A Yes—I am not able to speak to it on oath but I believe it is his-if I had seen it elsewhere I should have taken it to be his writing—I did not authorise that bill to be drawn out-Messrs Pilcher were indebted to me for a dozen of half-firkins—the prisoner did not pay me for them—I did not give him authority to sign my name for money received on my account MR CHAMBERS Q I think your son manages your business A Yes he is here—the prisoner received money in the business and also the other apprentice in my absences—I cannot say whose hand-writing the first line of this bill is—it is not mine—I believe it is not my son s-nor the second third or fourth line-with the exception of the paleness of the ink I do not think there is any difference in the writing—I have got my son s hand-writing in my pocket with the signature of this indenture—I have not been comparing that with the bill only before the Magistrate but the Magistrate would not go into that—I did not do that because I suspected it was my son s hand-writing—the prisoner confessed to me that he drew the money and forged the bill and said my son persuaded him to do it—he told me that in New Walk Dock-head—I took my son s hand-writing to show that it was not his writing—the prisoner told me he had destroyed my bill that I made out for twelve shilings—the Magistrate said he would have no comparison of hand-writing—I had no hand-writing to compare but the indenture—it was before I went to the Magistrate that the prisoner told me he had written it—I promised to forgive him if he told the truth—I cannot tell how it became a question whether it was my son s hand-writing—the prisoner told me he wrote it but I could not swear to the hand-writing—their hand-writing is very much alike—my son has had a quarrel with the prisoner and just after the Coronation he took him before the Magistrate for an assault because he would not do his work—he had been apprenticed since December—I had 5l premium 4l from Newington-school and 1l from his mother—I was to receive 5l more after twelve months—he was to learn the art of a cooper—I was brought up to the trade and served seven years—I have a situation in the employ of Thomas Jones and Co oil merchants—they require a cooper—my private business is conducted by my son—I have been looking at my son s hand-writing since I went before the Magistrate—my son pays me all the money he receives—it is only a trifling business JOHN GILES PILCHER I received this bill from the prisoner and paid him 3l 14s taking off 4s discount—it was precisely in this state when produced to me—it is signed by Russell who is in our concern and if it had been 100l I should have paid it—it is his duty to examine and mine to pay Cross-examined Q Did you know the prisoner before A I never saw him before to my knowledge—I am quite sure it was him—it was about half-past twelve o clock JAMES RUSSELL I am warehouseman to Messrs Pilcher of Morgan-lane On Saturday the 11th of August the prisoner brought this bill to my desk—the only charge in it then was in one line for 2 1/2 dozen of firkins 1l 4s —I put my name in the corner for him to go and receive twentyfour shillings-two items have been added since making it 3l 18s —I was at home when some firkins came—the prisoner brought part of them which made up the dozen—I now find a hand-writing on the bill for 3l 18s instead of 1l 4s Cross-examined Q Can you recollect who brought the rest of the casks was it the prosecutor s son A No—I do not think he has been on our premises for some months—this was a little business we gave him—we thought we were dealing with Thacker the younger—he formerly used to work on our premises WILLIAM THACKER JUN I carry on the coopering business on my father s account-no part of the receipt produced is my hand-writing nor was any of it written by my direction or with my knowledge—the prisoner never paid me this 3l 14s —he never produced the bill to me—I first saw it in Mr Russell s hands—the hand-writing does not bear the least resemblance to mine—I have no knowledge of the prisoner s writing—I never saw him write—I have had several quarrels with the prisoner Cross-examined Q Do you recollect witnessing an indenture of apprenticeship A Yes I signed my name to it—I have not been studying the hand-writing on that indenture—I cannot say that my father has shown it to me—he told me he had brought it here—he did not exactly tell me why he brought it—he did not tell me it was to compare with the prisoner s hand-writing—my father produced the indenture at Union Hall—the prisoner stated before the Magistrate that I told him to do this—there was no dispute about my hand-writing—I did not tell him to write it—I have had a good many quarrels with him—I have received a great many bills during the time I have served my father—I made these half-firkins but did not carry them home—I have received a great many bills from the Messrs Pilcher—I discovered this last Monday week—I do not receive the money—my mother receives it—either I or the apprentice go for it—Messrs Pilcher did not understand that the transaction was with me they knew to the contrary—Mr Russell is their managing man—he knew it was on my father s account—I received the order from the ware-houseman—my father told me on the Tuesday night that the prisoner said I directed him to do this—it was not till Thursday morning that we went before the Magistrate—I was sworn before the Magistrate—I cannot say whether my deposition was taken in writing Q Did you receive 11s 6d from the prisoner A No—my mother told me he had given her 11s 6d —I never saw the bill before the addition was made to it—I did not know of these words being added—I did not give the prisoner pen and ink to put any words in—I met him in Page s-walk after he had got the money-about twenty yards from our house and asked him if he had received the money my father had made out the bill for—he said Yes —I did not say Give me and my mother 11s 6d each and do what you please with the rest —my mother had made out the bill for 12s and he said they had taken off 6d discount JAMES RUSSELL re-examined When I affixed my name to the bill the prisoner went away from me—I was very busy and did not look which way he went—I gave him the bill to go across to the counting-house for the money—there was nothing to prevent his going away and making the addition to it The bill being read was for two dozen York firkins 2l two dozen do 1l 4s one dozen tar 14s total 3l 18s discount 4s 0d balance 3l 14s GUILTY of uttering Aged 16 — Transported

Martin Byrnes with content to defraud William Bennett —2nd COUNT for uttering the same with like intent—3rd and 4th COUNTS stating their intent to be to defraud he next of kin to the said Martin Byrnes MESSRS RYLAND and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM HARTREE I am clerk to Mr William Bennett carrying on at Rotherhithe He is the sole owner of the Resolution which left in 1834 for the South Sea voyage—in the event of the will in question being genuine Mr Bennett would have to pay the wages of deceased—I did not know Martin Byrnes—on the 1st of August the prisoner called at Mr Bennett s counting-house—he saw me and said he called to inquire about a man named Martin Byrnes belonging to the ship Resolution—I told him the Resolution had been home several months—I referred to the book and that Martin Byrnes had died at sea which I told him—he then said he had been acquainted with Byrnes s father many years and that Byrnes had lodged with him when at home and that he had left a will with him—I said Bring it over and let me look at it —he went away and called again on Monday or Tuesday the 6th or 7th of August and presented me a paper purporting to be a will—this is the paper— looking at it —on Booking at it I observed a cross made to it as the mark of Martin Byrnes—I referred to the ship articles which are in Court and finding Byrnes could write a tolerably good hand without acquainting the prisoner I asked him if Martin Byrnes could write—he said Yes he could write but had hurt his hand at the time and therefore made his mark —this excited my suspicion and I told him I did not like the appearance of it—I gave him the paper back and requested him to call again in a few days—he called again on Monday the 13th—I made a coramunication to Captain Garbutt and obtained from him a description of Byrnes—I went with him into the counting-house and asked the prisoner to describe Byrnes before that gentleman—he said he was a shortish man rather r stout and fullish-featured—I told him he could not receive the property without administering and asked if he had any proctor—I wrote Messrs Jenner s address in Doctors Commons and asked him to meet me there at eleven o clock—I asked him if he knew the attesting witnesses—he said one was living—he knew one of them—I said Bring that witness with you and if it is right you can administer —I returned the will to him—he had told me he lived at No 22 Charlotte-street Whitechapel-road—he gave me that address and it was also in the body of the will—I wrote it down the second time he came before I went to Doctors Commons—I went to the address he gave on the morning of the 14th and found it a very respectable public-house but no such person was known—I did not find him there at all—I went and saw Lea the officer and went with him to Mr Jenners at Doctors Commons—I waited there probably twenty minutes and then the two prisoners came in—we were in a private room—Mr Jenner s clerk brought the female prisoner into the room and I asked her what she knew about the male prisoner—she said she had known him some time and formerly did needle-work for his wife—I asked her respecting the signature of the attesting witness which she said was her writing—I said Here is a curious letter you have made of K in King-street—she said I never could make a K in my life —but with regard to Byrnes she said he had hurt his hand and therefore made the mark—Lea asked her many questions he then left the room and in about five minutes called me the passage—Glover was not present but from what Lea said I went Glover into the room where he was and said to him I am now satisfied you are wrong I have been to No 22 Charlotte-street and can find no such person known but perhaps you will go with us to Charlotte-street and point out the house where you live —he said he had no objection—I put the will into my pocket and afterwards gave it to Lea—we took a coach and went into Charlotte-street—he took us to No 50—I said How is this you told me No 22 —he said Good G— how could I make such a mistake the numbers must have been altered —a person came to the door who said they had occupied the house two years and that Glover did not lived there—after a great deal of trouble we found he lived in Great St Helened—but before that we went to No 109 Pennington-street and found he was not known there—he had told Lea he lived there Cross-examined by MR JONES Q You did not know Michael Byrnes at all and could not tell whether he could write or not yourself A Certainly not—I referred merely to the articles—I believe Mr Bennett is not here he resides at Farringdon in Berkshire—I told Glover the second time he came that I did not like the appearance of it— he came about a week after —he brought the will with him on each occasion and I gave it back to him—there was 33l due to Byrnes for his service in the ship—I do not know whether he had any relations JOHN CLARKE SPENCE I superintend the shipping of Mr William Bennett—here are the articles of the ship Resolution— I know nothing of Martin Byrnes except when he was shipped I saw him sign his name to the articles—I witnessed it THOMAS GARBUTT I am master of the ship Resolution South Seawhaler—Mr William Bennett is the sole owner—I sailed in heron the last voyage the 2nd of June 1834—Martin Byrnes was one of the crew—he continued on board until the 11th of June 1837 and then died—he was buried in the usual way at sea—I came back to this country on the 25th of February last and immediately saw Mr Hartree at Mr Bennet s office—I saw Glover there on the 13th of August in the presence of Hartree—I heard Hartree ask him to describe the deceased which he did—I had received information from Hartree about the will a few minutes before—Glover described Byrnes as rather shortish full-faced and thick-set—I then asked him Do you know what countryman the deceased was —the said he was an Irishman—I asked him if he knew what part of Ireland—he said Kilkenny—I told him he had not described the deceased right—he said nothing to that—I said Martin Byrnes was rather a tallish man and thin-faced and stood from five feet six to five feet seven—he made no answer—he by no means answered the description the prisoner gave of him—he had a hatchet-face Cross-examined Q When did you first know Byrnes A The day he entered on board the 2nd of June MR RYLAND Q Did you go the voyage A Yes—here is the logbook—the chief mate kept it under my directions—I see what he writes in it from time to time and generally see that he puts in what is right—this entry of the death of Byrnes is the mate s writing—it is a true entry—it was not made in my presence nor from information given by me—it is the occurrences of the day COURT Q How soon after the death did you see the entry in the book A I cannot say that I looked at the book for some time after—I Book at the log according to occurrences—it was entered by the chief mate at twelve o clock next day when he writes the log up—I know it is a faithfulentry—I have not the least doubt of it MR JONES Q Did you see the man when he was dead A Yes—we did not remain at sea from the time Byrnes was shipped at Gravesend till he died—we put into different harbors—we were abroad during the whole time—it was on the 13th I saw Glover—he went away then and the clerk told him to meet him next day at the proctor s—Byrnes was not in an ill state of health long before he died—he died in a few days from being taken ill The will was here read bequeathing his effects and wages to John Glover land appointing him sole executor witnessed by Thomas Wright and Caroline Blither of No 18 King Edward-street Mile-end JAMES LEA I am a constable of Lambeth-street On the 14th of August I went with Mr Hartree to Mr Jenner s—the prisoners came there—I called the female into a room where I was sitting with Mr Hartree and asked her what she was—she said she was a widow and lived at No 18 King Edward-street Mile-end New-town—I asked her what her husband was—she said he had been a bricklayer—I asked what she knew of John Glover—she said she had known him many years—she was in the habit of working there at times when his wife was alive but bad not worked for him for the last two years—I asked her how many rooms there were in Glover s house—she said there might be six or eight and it was in Charlotte-street Whitechapel—I asked if he let it out in lodgings—she said Yes —I asked what description of lodgers—she said sailors and she did jobs for them when they came from sea—I asked if she was sent for to sign that will—she said no she was at work there at the time—I asked her to describe Martin Byrnes—she said it was so long ago she could not recollect—I then went into the office where Glover was and asked where he lived—he—he said at No 109 Pennington-street Ratcliffe-highway and that he was tailor—I afterwards went there but nobody knew such a name—I asked him what he knew about Mrs Blisher—he said he had known her a great many years she was in the habit of coming to work at his house as a tailoress that he known Martin Byrnes many years and he always lodged with him when he came on shore and he knew his father also—Hartree said Why you have given a wrong address I have been to No 22 Charlotte-street Whitechapel and I could not find such a name there have you any objection to go with us to she us the house and we all went in a coach—he took us to No 50 but we found no such person as Glover lived there at the time—he looked up at the house and said the number must have been altered—I asked him in the coach what he knew of Wright the other subscribing witness—he said he knew him very well that he had left London and gone to America two years ago—I afterwards went to the Three Crowns in East Smithfield and found Glover s son was lodging there—I found he himself lived at No 26 St Helen s the son told me so—I have not heard from the prisoner himself that he lived there—I went to St Helen s—I went to where Blisher said she lived and found she did not live there—I found her sister lived there with a man named Bardell—I found in Glover s room a red book and three tickets in the name of Walduck Cross-examined Q What became of the woman while you went to the lodging of Glover as you thought A She was in the coach with us EDWARD SKSET I live in Bluegate-fields Shad well In 1834 I lived in New Gravel-lane Shad well—I knew Martin Byrnes he came home in April 1834 and lodged at my house until the 1st of June when he went with the Resolution—I went down to the ship with him—when he came to me on the 6th of April he came from the Lady Meloille from China—I fetched him home from the ship myself with other lodgers—she was an East Indiaman just arrived Cross-examined Q How do you know that A People lodging with me went out in her and came home in her—I was on board as soon as she arrived MR RYLAND Q From the 6th of April till the 1st of June did he ever leave your lodging A He was never away twenty-four hours—he always slept at home MR JONES Q Do you mean to swear he never slept away from your house a single night A I will swear he was not away twentyfour hours—he might be out one night but I did not lose sight of him for twenty-four hours THOMAS PARKS I was with Cooper on board the Resolution on her last voyage—I knew the deceased Byrnes and know he could write—I have seen him write—I should not be able to speak to his hand-writing—I never knew him make a mark for his signature—in 1834 I belonged to the Eclipse South Sea whaler—Byrnes then belonged to the Lady Melville East Indiaman—I saw him on shore at St Helena in February 1834—it was then I first became acquainted with him—the vessel was on her voyage home then HENRY PETER ROW I am a mariner In February 1833 I went out in the Lady Melville— we sailed from Gravesend for Bombay and China—I am sure of the year—I knew the deceased but not by the name of Martin Byrnes—we used to call him Paddy Byrnes on board the ship because he was of Irish descent—I never knew his right name—he was about twenty years old—not quite so stout as me and about five feet seven—his face was not altogether fat—he might hare a little fat about him—he was much about the same size as myself—we touched at St Helena in our passage home COURT Q Can you tell us where he was in November 1833 A At Christmas 1833 he was at Rio-bars in the East India Straits—he was not in England in November 1833—I came home with him and lodged in the same house with him at Skeet s—I never lost sight of him during the whole voyage Cross-examined Q Are you still a seaman A No I have not been to sea since—there was nothing extraordinary in Paddy Byrnes—his was always a very quiet steady man—I lodged with him at Skeet s for months—I work in the Docks now—I have nothing but my memory to fix the date but I know the time we arrived very well—I am quite sure the date is correct—William Drake was on board with me WILLIAM DRAKE I am a labourer and live in Fortunate-place Bluegate-fields—I went a voyage in the Lady Melville to the East Indies—she started in January 1833 from Gravesend for Bombay—I am quite clear about that—I went in her and returned in her—Martin Byrnes was on board and returned with her in April the following year—we called him Paddy Byrnes for a nick name EDWARD SKEET re-examined I knew him by the name of Martin Byrnes—I have heard him called Paddy Byrnes by his shipmates Row and others—I have his name entered in my book as Martin Byrnes which was the name he gave me—I have entered here the day he came home ELIZABETH WEBB I am a widow and live in Parr place Islington I am proprietor of the house No 50 Charlotte-street White chapel and have been so since 1814—neither of the prisoners were ever tenants of that house Cross-examined Q Have you had a tenant in it of the name of Glover A Yes who I believe to be the prisoner s son—I do not know the prisoner at all JOHN HARDHAM WAPLE I am clerk to Messrs Jenner and Co of Dean s-court Doctors Commons When the will was produced there I asked Blisher in the presence of Mr Hartree and Lea about it—she said that was her signature pointing to the signature Caroline Blisher King Edward-street Mile-end —it was brought to our office to be proved by the prisoner Glover Cross-examined Q Did Glover produce the will to you A He did COURT Q What did the woman say A She said that it was her signature to it—I did not ask here where it was executed THOMAS BARDELL I am a basket-maker and live at No 18 King Edward-street Mile-end I know the female prisoner—I have seen her several times—she was in the habit of coming to my house once a week or once a fortnight—I also know Glover —as far as I understand they are father and daughter—she never lived in my house—I have lived there nearly two years—she has not lived there during that time Cross-examined Q Are you sure you have not lived there longer than

t18381022-2333  2333 EDWARD COONEY was indicted for feloniously forging on the 4th of October at St James s Clerkenwell a certain order for the payment of 5l with intent to defraud the Governor and Company of the Bank of England 2nd COUNT for uttering the same with like intent 3rd and 4th COUNTS stating his intent to be to defraud Louis Clermont Duval 5th and 6th COUNTS with intent to defraud Thomas Long MESSRS MAULE ADOLPHUS and BULLOCK conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM FABIAN I am a clerk in the Drawing-office in the Bank of England It is the practice to issue cheques in books of fifty each which are marked and numbered so that we can tell to whom we deliver them—each cheque is marked—Laurence and Blenkarne had an account with he Bank of England—I received an order in September purporting to come from them for some cheques—this is the order looking at —I do not recollect by whom it was delivered—I delivered a book of fifty cheques in pursuance of that order—the cheques are printed and numbered—the Bank had no depositor of the name of George White at that time COURT Q What were the numbers you delivered A They were marked T 12—1851 to 1900 —these are four of the cheques looking at them DAVID BLENKARNE I am a solicitor in partnership with Mr Laurence our business is carried on in Bucklersbury We had an account at the Bank and have now—I know the prisoner perfectly—he was in our employ about two years and a half as junior clerk and left us in March 1836—I have seen him write frequently—it was part of his duty to go to the Bank to pay money and receive cheques—this order for a cheque-book was not written by me or my partner or by our authority—I believe it to be the hand-writing of the prisoner—it is an imitation of my handwriting—this cheque signed G White is like the prisoner s writing—that is my conscientious belief—the whole body as well as the signature—I mean the filling up—here is one cheque signed G Wilson that signature I am not as clear about—but the date of the 4th of October is like the prisoner s writing I believe it to be his—the signature of Whitaker to this other I cannot speak to but the date 4th October I believe to be his writing—the other signed Henry White is more like the prisoner s writing than any of the others—I believe it to be his signature as well as the date—I am certain this letter looking at one is the prisoner s handwriting—I should say the whole of it is his Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How long is it since you have seen the prisoner write A About two years when he left our employ—there were two other clerks in the office at the time he was there THOMAS PRALL I am clerk to Laurence and Blenkarne and have been so about four years The prisoner was my fellow-clerk about two years—there were three clerks—I have had frequent opportunities of seeing the prisoner s handwriting so as to form a knowledge of it—I have no doubt this order for the cheque-book is his handwriting—this cheque signed George White I believe is his handwriting also—this one signed H White I have no doubt about—I am not so satisfied of the one signed Wilson but I believe it is his—I am pretty certain the figures his the £5 and the date—I think this signed Whitaker is his-but it is not so plain— looking at letter No 3 —I think this is the prisoner s writing it is signed Henry Lee — looking at No 2 —I have no doubt of this being the prisoner s writing—one word particularly—looking at letter No 1 —I have no doubt of that being the prisoner s hand-writing Cross-examined Q How long is it since you have seen him write A A little more than two years—I went before the Magistrate but was not examined—Mr Blenkarne was examined to the writing—I have seen the order for the cheque-book several times before—I believe that to be the prisoner s hand-writing—I could not be better satisfied of it unless I had seen him write—I have no doubt whatever of the letter Mr Blenkarne—I have no doubt whatever about either of these—Hethiogton was the name of my fellow-clerk who was in the office with the prisoner MR BLENKARNE re-examined I believe this letter purporting to the from the Rev Mr Long to Mr Parish to be the prisoner s writing and this other from Mr Long to Mr Duval I believe to be his—the one signed H Lee I am not so clear about but I believe it to be his ELLEN DUVAL I am the wife of Louis Clermont Duval who lives at No 86 Charlotte-street Fitzroy-square On the 4th of October I received a letter from my husband—I saw the boy who brought it but did not we it delivered to my husband—I did not see it-before it came from my husband s hands to mine—after reading the letter I saw my husband deliver to our boy a 5l note to go and get change and I myself gave the money to the strange boy who came to the house—this is the letter and the cheque which came in it— looking at them LOUIS CLERMONT DUVAL I am a water-gilder and reside at No 86 Charlotte-street Fitzroy-square On the 4th of October I received this letter No 1 from a young man in my employ who brought it to me—on I receiving it I took the 5l note out of my purse told my young man to take it to his mistress and tell her to cash the cheque—I know Mr Long—he is a Catholic priest—this is the cheque which came with the note—it purports to be signed G White payable to Mr Long The documents were here read as follows — To Edward Laurence Esq 32 Bucklersbury 28th Sept —33 Sir I hope you will pardon the liberty I have taken in writing to you I am reduced to the greatest distress or I would not have troubled you If you would favour me with a small sum if ever so trifling by bearer I shall feel for ever grateful I would call myself but after my conduct to you and Mr Blenkarne I am ashamed to see you EDWARD COONEY September 28 —38 Give the bearer a cheque-book LAURENCE & BLENKARNE No 1 4th October —38 Rev Mr Long presents his compliments to Mr Duval and will take it as a favour if he will cash the inclosed cheque having

No 3 2nd October —38 To Rev Mr Spain My dear Sir You will be doing me a great favour if you will cash the inclosed cheque which I have just received it being too late for banking hours and as I am very much in want of cash to-night HENRY LEE Cheque Pay Mr Lee or bearer 5l HENRY WHITE REV THOMAS LONG I am a Roman Catholic clergyman and officiate at the chapel in Sutton-street Soho-square I know Mr Duval perfectly well—he is one of my congregation—this note No 1 is not my writing—it is a letter to Mr Duval purporting to come from me—I never authorised any one to write it or take it to Mr Duval—I did not write that note No 2 to Mr Parish nor authorise anybody to write it or deliver it—I never saw this cheque before the prisoner was in custody—I do not know the prisoner—I have a girl named Cooney in my employ—I do not know from the Prisoner that she is his sister REV HENRY LEE I am a Roman Catholic clergyman I know a gentleman named Spain—he is a Roman Catholic clergyman—I did not write this note to him nor authorise anybody else to write it FREDERICK WILSON I am a silk-mercer and live in Hanway-street Oxford-street in partnership with Mr Swain This cheque signed Whittaker was brought to me on Saturday the 6th of October—I believe the prisoner is the person who brought it—it was between eight and nine o clock in the evening—there was a gas light in my shop and sufficient light to see him distinctly—he was there several minutes—I feel no hesitation in saying it was him Cross-examined Q What did you mean by saying you believed it was him at first—did not you mean that you would not swear positively A I can swear positively—I have not always been quite so positive at I am to-day—I did not say I believed he was not the person—when I was called into the police-office to see the prisoner I said he was very much like him but was not prepared to say he was the man HENRY GOTTO I am assistant to Mr Wilson I was in the shop on the 6th of October but not at the time the person came in—I was there while he was waiting there—I did not see what he brought—I did not see Mr Wilson give him anything or transact any business—I did not hear the person say anything—he was in the shop about three minutes—I believe the prisoner to be the person COURT Q Do you remember the day of the week A On Satruday between eight and nine o clock in the evening—I cannot tell on what Saturday—I attended at the police-office on the Tuesday after that Saturday—I believe Saturday was the 6th Cross-examined Q Did you see the prisoner at the station—house A I did—I did not then think he was the person—I said I thought he was not the person—I did not positively say he was not—I see him now under a different impression and believe him to be the person MR BLENKARNE re-examined I attended at the police-office when the prisoner was in custody—the first examination was on Tuesday week Witnesses for the Defence HENRY BURTON I am a soldier I have known the prisoner two years—he bore a good character—I remember Saturday the 6th of October last—I saw the prisoner that day at Mr Godfrey s at the White Lion in Drury-lane about half-past six o clock in the evening—he was in my company till twenty minutes after ten—I took out my watch at twenty minutes after ten MR MAULE Q For what purpose did you take out your watch A I had to attend the theatre at half-past ten—I am one of the Guards there—I was playing at skittles with the prisoner—we had a game of billiards at Godfrey s until about seven o clock and then went to Mr Perkins s public-house opposite in Drury-lane—I am not sure of the sign—we went to the skittle-ground there and played at skittles till twenty minutes after ten—my brother was there and two others named Davis and Glenny—we were all playing at skittles by gas light in an open skittleground behind the house—there were other persons there—we sat down till they had finished and then we played—the landlord was not there—the pot-boy was—we had only beer to drink—I did not leave the prisoner there—he came away with me and went into Godfrey s where we had been before—I left him there and did not see him again that evening—I have known him two years—that was after he left the office of Laurence and Blenkarne—I never knew him in their employ Q What has he been doing during the two years A I only know he came to Mr Godfrey s—his father is cutter-out for Sunderland and Co tailors to our regiment—I have known him at this public-house—I cannot say how he got his living—I never heard of his having any occupation—I do not know at all what he is—I am in the 24th Regiment—I first saw him about two years ago COURT Q Have you known more of him than meeting him at the public-house A No I am not related to him WILLIAM BURTON I am a cutter and live at the Wheataheaf Redlion-street Holborn I have known the prisoner two yean he was very well spoken of On Saturday the 6th of October I saw him at Mr Godfrey s the White Lion in Drury-lane and afterwards at another public-house kept by Perkins—I first saw him at Godfrey s about six or half-past six o clock and was with him from that time till about half-past ten o clock—my brother and two other young men were with us—there were five of us altogether—we were playing at billiards at first and afterwards at skittles—I have been out of Court while my brother was examined—I did not hear a word of his evidence—we had some porter to drink—we separated at half-past ten o clock—I went to Drury-lane Theatre with my brother—we were both employed there MR MAULE Q Was any body else besides your brother and you there A Two young men named Glenny and Davis—they are not here—I met the prisoner at the White Lion—we played at Milliards there and then went to the public-house opposite and played at skittles—it was not an open skittle-ground—it was covered in with a sky-light and lighted with gas—I played at skittles there—we had porter and half-and-half to drink—no spirits—I have known the prisoner two or three years—I really do not know what he is—I only knew him as a companion—I understood he was a clerk during the two years—I do not know where—I merely knew him at the-public-house and at the theatre—he was employed there some time ago as a supernumerary sometimes to go on in different scenes as a soldier and so on—I know a person living in Clare-court—I do not know whether it is No 9—it is the last house in Clare-court on the left hand from Drury-lane—I did not meet the prisoner there—I know there is a person there of the prisoner s acquaintance—I know the prisoner s father—he is a cutter—I do not know that they are Roman Catholics—I merely knew him as a companion at the public-house—during the time I we known him I knew nothing disrespectful of him FRANCIS WILLIAM GLINDON I am a painter and glazier I have known the prisoner some years—I have seen him write as late as the latter end of July or August but I have often seen him write for the last six or seven years—I do not believe the H Whitaker to this cheque to be his handwriting decidedly not— looking at the cheque signed G White —there is not one part of this that is his handwriting—I will not swear to the whole of it but it is not his handwriting—the letter signed Lee is not his hand-writing-so help me God it is not MR ADOLPHUS Q You knew him when he was at Laurence and Blenkarne s A I did—I was not in their office—I am no relation of the prisoner—I knew him by being a school-fellow of my brother and during the time he was away from Laurence and Blenkarne s office at dinner time he used to come to an office where I served my time and assist me in copying letters and sorting when I was pressed—that was at Mr Power s No 8 Cornhill who is a general merchant—he deals in wine and executes any commissioon abroad—I swear positively these papers are not the prisoner s handwriting—I cannot swear it is not his handwriting but it is not the character of the handwriting—I handwriting I know of his—the note I read is not like his handwriting—to the best of my belief not one of the three I have seen is his handwriting—I will not swear the one signed Whitaker is not his handwriting but it is not his character of handwriting—I cannot say but what a man might disguise his hand—I cannot say whether the signature Henry Whitaker is his or not—my handwriting at one time was so like his that I could not tell one from the other—those papers I have seen are not at all like his handwriting—not in the slightest degree like his handwriting—I think I should know his writing when he was at Laurence and Blenkarne s if it was shown to me-his hand is not improved since then because he has worked for me—his hand has fallen off—I cannot say that I could swear to what he wrote when at Laurence and Blenkarne s—I might give an opinion on it—his hand is decidedly altered since that but not so as to do away with the resemblance—the character of the hand would be the same but the handwriting is not—the signatures of the papers which have been shown to me are not like his handwriting in form or character COURT Q Is the letter signed Lee like it—is any part of the body of it like the prisoner s handwriting A It is not anything like his handwriting—nor is it his hand—no part of it MR ADOLPHUS Q Look at the cheque signed Henry White A It is not his writing as I said before not any part that I can see at all like it—the Henry White is not his not yet the filling up—the date might be—the figure is the only thing that is something like his hand—it might be taken for the same—the figure 3 —that is all—not anything besides the 3 —this signed George White is not like his—that is the same handwriting that wrote the letter—I will not swear that no part of it is like the prisoner s writing but I will swear the signature is not his—to the best of my belief there is some part of it like his writing—the filling up part of the body—it is exactly similar to his handwriting—I do not believe the signature to be his writing but the filling-up—this George Wilson was not written by him—the 4th October I think was written by him and not any other part—I am not sure that the filling—up is his handwriting—I should say not—it is the character of his handwriting—it is something of the same character but the signature of the cheque is not his writing—now I come more minutely to look into it I do not think any part of it is his writing—the word October is something similar to it but the hand to me is not the same as he used to write—the cheque is not filled up in his writing nor a bit like it—no part of this letter is like his handwriting—lawyers clerks write so much alike it is almost impossible to tell—when I saw the depositions yesterday I thought them his handwriting and asked if he wrote them himself—I never saw any of these cheques before—the last time I saw him write was the latter end of June or July—he was with me writing in my business—I am a painter and glazier—he has been employed by me on elections from the time he left Lawrence and Blenkarne up to July or August—he was employed by me in town and out of town too as check clerk and as committee clerk—he was employed by me at the Finsbury election and previous to that at the East Surrey Westminster Marylebone Lambeth and several other places—my friends recommended me—I was no more than himself—I might hare had a department given to me which I superintended such as directing letters making out a list of voters directing circulars to them and checking those that had polled—he has also been employed by me selling wine for Mr Power in the Docks—painting and glazing is my employ in the summer—I was not present at the prisoner s examination at the police-office—he did not send for me—I live at No 21 Arundel-street Strand—I have been at home for the last fortnight—I have not been to Birmingham in that time—I never was there in my life GUILTY Aged 21 — Transported for Life There were three other indictments against the prisoner Before Mr Baron Gurney 
t18381022-2382  2382 BENJAMIN MARTIN was indicted for feloniously forging on the 20th of September at Ratcliff a bill of exchange for the payment and value of 19l 18s with intent to defraud George Edward Stagg —2nd COUNT stating it to before uttering the same Mr Ballantine conducted the Prosecution GIORGE EDWARD STAGG I am a file manufacturer and live at Sheffield In August last I came to town and was staying at the Thatched House tavern in the Strand—on the 1st of August the prisoner called on me there—I did not know him before—he said he was recommended to me—that Mr Wilson his partner who lived in Regent s-park was connected with the Customs and had considerable influence and if I could supply articles well he should be able to purchase to a largte-amount—he appointed to meet me at a coffee-house at half-past seven o clock next morning but did not come and I returned to Sheffield—about ten or eleven days afterwards I received this letter— looking at one — I saw the prisoner afterwards and told him I had received his letter—I do not know that he made any remark—he did not deny it being his letter —it contained an order signed B Martin & Co —in consequence of that order I supplied the goods directly as mentioned in the letter amounting to 16l 10s 7d —a few days afterwards I saw the prisoner again—he came to my house at Sheffield—I asked him how he liked the goods—he said he had not received any and said I had not sent any—I took him to the warehouse and showed him a sample of the goods that were made over what I had sent—he said they would do very well—I took him to the wagon-office and convinced him they had been sent and he said he would pay me for them—I went with him to where he was staying and he said I will pay you now and he took out an invoice which I had sent him of the first goods—he said I might send the other goods—he did not name any particular quantity—he said I might send what was in the warehouse in a box—they were files and came to better than 20l —they were sent off to the wagon-office before we went to his lodgings—when we got there he asked for the invoice and said he would pay me for both together which was 37l odd—I received these two bills from him in payment—they are for 19l 18s and 19l 11s which was more than the amount—I gave him a memorandum to make up the difference—I asked him who John Watson the drawer of one of them was and he told me—a friend of mine wrote down what he said in my presence—I asked him who Richard Houghton was and my friend wrote down his answer—I saw what my friend wrote—it was according to what the prisoner stated—I sent that paper afterwards up to town for inquiry to be made—this is the paper— looking at it —I did the same with regard to another bill—I saw the names on another bill taken down—I sent the particulars of the whole four bills up to town on the same paper Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Was it not arranged when you first saw him in the Strand that if he could not call on you next morning he was to write to you for the goods he might want A I do not remember that—I gave him my address at Sheffield—he did not say anything about writing but that he would call next morning—I do not think he gave me his name and address at that time—I think I received his address in the letter—I do not remember his giving it me in the Strand— looking at a letter —this is my writing—I believe there was some delay in complying with the prisoner s request—when he came to me at Sheffield and I satisfied him the goods were sent off a negotiation commenced for more goods—I had consented to take his acceptance—I did not understand that I should draw a bill on him and he accept it—I proposed that I should draw on him but instead of that he gave me the bills produced—it was in consequence of my asking a grocer whether the bills were good that the addresses were taken down—one Ballard took them down the morning after my interview with the prisoner on this piece of paper—I did not see it taken down on anything but that—the prisoner was present when it was written and it was from his mouth it was put down—I should think he could see what the grocer wrote—he could see as well as I could if he looked—I cannot say whether he took the paper in his hand after it was written—when the grocer wrote it down the prisoner asked him if there was anything more he could put down—the second quantity of goods were sent to the wagon-office—I do not know where they are now—I paid the carriage of them—I have not made inquiry about them since I came here—the bills were given to me on the 2nd of October I think—I came to town about the bills I think on the 11th or 12th of this month before the prosecution was instituted—the bills will not be due till November—the prisoner offered to take one of the bills back if I did not like them when the names were taken down—he did not name any one—I did not give it him but I was not satisfied MR BALLANTINE Q When you first saw the prisoner in London did he state that he had a partner and that they were in a large way of business A He did—I believed him from those representations to be a person of credit—I did not take the names down myself—I heard what the prisoner said—I overlooked the grocer and saw what he wrote—when the prisoner offered to take back one bill he did not offer to substitute money for it—he had then only received the 16l parcel of goods—the other had not gone then—they were at the wagon-office but had not quitted Sheffield Paper read — John Watson ship owner 30 Duke-street Spitalfields Richard

Sheffield who I do business with I made inquiry about Watson of Duck street and Houghton a ship-owner and no such persons are know there at all—they knew nothing of them—a bricklayer named Pink lived at Watson s address—I did not inquire in the neighbourhood only at the No of the house it was addressed to—I inquired at No 36 Fitzroy-market for Coleman and no such person was known there JOHN COPP I am clerk to Child and Co bankers There is no John Coleman of No 36 Fitzroy-market keeping an account at our house GOODENOUGH I live at No 36 Fitzroy-market and have done so two years and in other

Spitalfields I lived at No 30 Duke-street until last Monday morning for five years and eight months—I never knew of a John Watson living in the house—I know no such person—I do not know a ship-owner

and take my meals at my father s in Broad-street Ratcliff—he carries on business there—On Saturday the 22nd of September I recollect seeing a person named Lee with my father while I was at home at dinner-time—I had seen him several times before coming backwards and forwards to the house—I do not know whether he had dealings with my father—I saw him on that occasion give my father some bills—my attention was not directed to them—I should not know them if I saw them again—since this charge has been made against my father I have endeavoured to find Lee but cannot do so any where—he used to live at No 30 Duke-street Spitalfields—I have inquired there and at other places but cannot find him MR BALLANTINE Q Are you quite certain the day this took place was on the 22nd of September A Yes I had not seen any dealing take place between Lee and my father—I never saw him give my father bills on any other occasion—I do not know what Lee is—I do not know a person named Yellond—I have not made inquiry after him myself—there has been inquiry made—I do not know any such person BENJAMIN BEDDOW CROSS I am clerk to Mr Biggs the solicitor In consequence of a communication with our client Mr Stagg I called at the prisoner s address—I found him living there—I found the name of Martin over the door and saw a female in the shop who I supposed to be his wife—I did not leave my direction there—I was informed Mr Martin would be in in the course of the evening—I went there again at six o clock the same evening and saw him in his shop—I told him I came from Mr Stagg the prosecutor and wished to say something on the subject of the bills he had given him—we had then withdrawn to a private part of the shop there being somebody there—he hurried me away stating that he would call on me any where I wished—I gave him my address—he seemed to wish me to leave in consequence of a person being in the shop—he was to call that evening but he called at ten o clock the following morning—he had told me he could not come till late in the evening—I told him the parties could not be found whose names appeared on the bills—in answer to which he smiled and said If you don t know where they live and can t find them I do and put himself in a position of defiance—he threatened to prosecute Mr Stagg for not sending the second parcel of goods—he admitted having received the first—he said he had given him 40l in bills and had only received 16l worth of goods—I did not tell him if he did not take the bills back he must take the consequences—I said Have you any proposal to make about them —he said Nothing at all —I said Then I have nothing to say to you then I must seek my remedy —nothing was said about seeing him again in two hours or about his being in Covent Garden—after this interview I saw Mr Stagg and a policeman and took him into custody in Covent Garden but nothing was said about Covent Garden—I happened to find him there—I do not recollect any proposition being made to him to take the bills back and give money for them—I said Have yon any thing to propose —of course I meant had he the money to give and take his bills back —he complained before that about not receiving his goods and threatened a prosecution MR BALLANTINE Q In any part of the conversation did he mention Lee A No—he referred to the parties—he said I know where to find them if you do not —when he left the office

intent to defraud John Isaac Drury 2nd COUNT for uttering the same MR PHILLIPS conducted the Prosecution JOHN ISAAC DRURY I live at No 32 James-street Manchester-square and am a harness-maker—I have known the prisoner about five years—she called on me last Sunday fortnight about seven o clock in the evening and asked me if I would get her a bill of exchange discounted bearing the acceptance of Lady Wood of No 4 Bedford-square—I said I could if the acceptance would bear investigation—I asked her if she had got the acceptance—she said not but she had just left Lady Wood and was to return to her about nine o clock—she told me previous to that that her ladyship had promised her her acceptance for 230l —I asked her how her ladyship came to promise her acceptance for so large an amount—she stated that the had laid before her ladyship all her papers and documents relative to her business in the country that her ladyship pitied her case very much and said she was sorry she had not got so much cash by her but if her acceptance was of any use she should have it for two months—I asked her if she had a stamp—she said she had not but that Lady Wood had given her 5s to purchase it—that would be the correct stamp—she asked me what my friend would charge for discounting the bill—I told her 5 per cent or 1s in the pound making 11l 10s —she then went away—she came next morning about nine o clock and brought this bill—I went to a banking-house and on the same Monday I went to Lady Wood myself—I had not cashed the bill—in consequence of what passed between Lady Wood and myself I directly returned to my own house accompanied by Mr Overton—it was about one o clock when I got back—the prisoner was there and I asked her where she got the bill—she stated from Lady Wood—I said Well that must be wrong for Mr Overton has been down to Hoare s bank and they have detained the bill —she said she certainly obtained the bill from Lady Wood and that it was a genuine bill—I told her Hoare s had declared they did not believe the acceptance to be Lady Wood s hand-writing—she said it was the hand-writing of Lady Wood—I said it was useless to utter falsehoods for I had been to Lady Wood myself and she had declared that she never accepted a bill in her life and that she had not seen the prisoner for three or four months—she said Well if Lady Wood will deny her hand-writing I suppose I must bear the brunt of it — I had not told her it would be better for her to confess or worse if she did not nor had Mr Overton —Mr Overton went away a short time—the prisoner went into an adjoining room which is a bed-room and I afterwards found she had swallowed laudanum—I sent for a doctor and she recovered—I told her she had done a very wrong deed and observed to her at the same time that she had put me and Mr Overton in a very awkward predicament—she said she could not help it—that it was all brought on by a man named Pankridge—she wanted me to write to him in the country but I did not Prisoner The witness is quite aware how I came into my trouble and instead of trying to assist me he tried to oppose me though I have assisted him Witness I do not know how she came into trouble Prisoner I must leave it to the mercy of my Lord and the Jury—if it had not been for Mr Drury and some others I should not have been here to-day—he is quite aware in his own conscience that I have not been unjust to any one ANDREW WYNESS I am a policeman I took the prisoner into custody at Mr Drury s house on Monday the 3rd of December—she said she had done wrong and was sorry for it—Mr Drory s mother-in-law who stood by her had said previous to that Never mind you are not the first that committed forgery —the prisoner at the time was under the effect of poison and was very much agitated and distressed—after the arrival of the doctor and extracting the poison she used nearly the same expression—she afterwards said she had done it with the intention of paying the creditors that after a period of twenty years her friend in the country had brought her to it COURT Q You have not stated that in your depositions or about the female saying You are not the first that committed forgery A I told the magistrate that—I am not positive whether I told him the other—I am sure she said all I have stated LADY SARAH WOOD I live at No 4 Bedford-square I have known the prisoner about twelve years—she had lived in the family of a friend of mine in Oxfordshire—the acceptance to this bill is not my hand-writing— looking at it —I never authorised the prisoner or any body to accept the bill

varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution ANN CLARK I am in the service of Mr Money at the George Inn at Uxbridge On the 3rd of January the prisoner came to my master s house and had refreshment which came to 4s 8d —I waited on him with his bill and he gave me this cheque— looking at it —he wished me to take his bill out of the cheque—I took it to my master who returned it to me saying he could not change it—I delivered it to the prisoner—he then said he wished my master to get it changed at the banker s for him—I took it and gave it to my master with that message JOHN MONEY I keep the George at Uxbridge Clark brought me this cheque—I returned it to her—she afterwards brought it back to me requesting me to get it changed at the bank—it was dated 1838 when she brought it to me—I sent my son John with it to the bank of Howe and Smith at Uxbridge—he returned with two £10 notes—in consequence of what he said I went myself to the bank returned the two £10 notes and Mr Smith gave me back the cheque—I found my name had been written on it—I returned to my house went up stairs and saw the prisoner—I told him I could not get the cheque changed that the bank refused to change it—he said it was very strange what were banks for but to change cheques—I said they know neither me nor the party to whom it was payable and I should decline having any thing to do with it—he said he had no change—I drew his attention to its being dated 1838—he said that must be evidently a mistake of the person who drew the cheque—he then took a pen and altered the 8 to 9—I returned him the cheque—I called in a constable and desired him to take him into custody if he went away without paying his bill and he was taken—I recollect having seen him before three or four years ago by the name of Attwood—he did not mention any name on this occasion Prisoner Q I think I made no representation as to who was the drawer of the cheque A No more than I have stated Prisoner I felt surprised at the manner in which he treated me—he has cashed cheques for me before in a similar manner Witness He used my house from about 1832 to 1834 or 1835 as a commercial traveller—I believe he was one of the partners—the firm was Attwood and Beale—I have had letters from him in the name of Attwood and Beale wholesale grocers Little St Thomas Apostle and Maiden-lane JOHN MONET JUN I am the son of the last witness I was sent by my father with a cheque to the banker s at Uxbridge and brought him back two £10 notes and a message—I gave the notes to him—I did not go back with him JOHN NICHOLSON I carry on business as a wharfinger in Thames-street London I keep an account at Smith Payne and Smith—this cheque is not in my handwriting nor was it written by my authority—I have no knowledge of it whatever THOMAS WALLIS I am clerk to Messrs Smith Payne and Smith Mr John Nicholson keeps an account at our house in the name of John Nicholson and Co —we have no account in the name of John Nicholson—we had an account with the firm of Attwood and Beale wholesale grocers Little St Thomas Apostle from three to five years ago—I am not exactly acquainted with the person of the prisoner—we issue different coloured cheques for the different letters of initials of our customers—the red cheque goes from A to C—Attwood and Beale would have a red cheque like this—Mr Nicholson s would be quite a different colour—I knew the firm of Attwood and Beale but not their persons—I know Mr Attwood s writing perfectly well—I should say the filling up of this cheque is in the same hand-writing as Attwood and Beale used to sign—the figures yery much correspond—whether the prisoner is the person that used to fill up those cheques I do not know—I believe this to be the same handwriting as Attwood and Beale s cheques used to be written in—I should say the signature is intended to imitate Mr Nicholson s band-writing—it is similar to it but whose hand-writing it is I cannot tell— looking at two other cheques —the filling up of these appears to be in the same handwriting—I think both the partners Attwood and Beale drew cheques as far as I remember JOHN LARKIN I am a constable and live at Ickenham On the 3rd of January I was sent for to the George at Uxbridge and took the prisoner into custody—I searched him and found on him these three cheques this cheque-book a quantity of keys some letters and a knife—I saw my brother constable find 3s 6d in his waistcoat pocket—I asked him who he was—he said he should not tell me and if I was an officer I must do my duty—I told him I took him because I thought he had a cheque about him which was not a genuine one The cheque in question being read was London 2nd January 1839 Smith Payne and Smith Pay

Sloane-street Chelsea I have lived there thirty-nine years—I know the prisoner very well indeed—I knew his father who is now dead—I am entitled to some property which I am kept out of—I put my whole confidence in the prisoner and I had a good deal of conversation with him about it—he said it was all going on well and I was in a fair prospect of recovering the property—the prisoner is a schoolmaster by profession—after his father was dead and buried a friend of theirs at Woodbridge sent him to me to thank me for my kindness to his father and that was How we became acquainted—I told him myself that I had a claim to some property and told him my case—I took him into my house for six weeks when he first came—he was very much distressed—he said if my claim was looked into I should recover the property—he said he knew a gentleman in the law who was very clever a Sir John Laws who was a commissioner of laws—I put it down in my little book— reads — Sir John Laws commissioner of laws Plummer s-buildings Temple —he told me he used to see Sir John Laws and he had 6l or seeing him—he proposed that Sir John Laws should look into this business and I furnished him with various sums of money for the purpose of communicating with Sir John Laws—I did so at his request—he used to tell me what he should want and received letters from Sir John—the prisoner said be wanted 100l to send to Mr Salmon Sir John Laws clerk at Brighton who was to send this money to the Archbishop of Canterbury for a faculty to remove my father s body to the family vault of his ancestors the Buckingham family—I had four letters from Sir John—he showed me a letter about the faculty—this is it— looking at one —it came to me by post—here is the post-mark—I read it myself and the prisoner also read it over to me as part I could hardly make out—it is written across and across—he told me it was Sir John Laws letter—here is Sir John Laws name to it—he did not tell me whose letter it was only that Sir John Laws had written for this sum of money and I showed him the letter THOMAS MALL AN I am a broker and appraiser and live in George-street Chelsea I have known the prisoner well for about two years and have seen him write frequently—I believe this letter to be his handwriting Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Have you been acquainted with Mrs Woodden at all A Yes I have distrained for rent for her—I was employed to distrain for rates for the parish of Chelsea sixteen or seventeen years ago—I was not dismissed from that in consequence of any deficiencies—I gave it up to go into the public line—I continued in that line about eleven months it did not answer my purpose and I let it and became a broker again—no charge was ever made against me for appropriating money belonging to the parish—I had a daughter occasionally in the prosecutrix s employ—I am not aware that she was dismissed by the representation of the prisoner—I never said the prisoner had got my daughter out of the prosecutrix s service by false statements and I would do for him for it—I told him I thought he had acted very wrong in raising reports about ray daughter going for porter for Mrs Woodden and charging 6d for what she paid 4d for—that was after he made use of very improper language to me—I have seen the prisoner write frequently—I cannot exactly recollect now what—I have seen him write letters frequently some a year and a half ago and some within the last four or five months—I have seen him write in Mrs Woodden s kitchen—I have seen him write two or three hands—I will swear I have seen him write that hand—I do not remember on what occasion he wrote that band—I am still a broker—I have been nothing but a broker and publican for the last twenty-six years—I served my time to a tailor This letter was here read It was addressed to the prosecutrix and purported to be favoured by Lord Ebrington dated St Cloud near Paris 27th March 1839 It held out to the prosecutrix that her claim was in the course of investigation and conclusive evidence had been obtained and urging the necessity of re-interring her father s body in the family vault which would be impossible without interest being made with the Archbishop of Canterbury Signed J LAWS SOPHIA WOODDEN re-examined The prisoner told me 100l was to be sent to Mr Salmon for the Archbishop of Canterbury for the faculty—I went to the Bank with the prisoner went to my broker and he sold the money out—I went to Masterman s and deposited it there to be sent down to Mr Salmon at Brighton—I think it was on the 4th of April last—the prisoner was with me—he saw me lay the money down on the counter and the gentleman take it up THOMAS MALLAN re-examined The indorsement on this £100 note is in the prisoner s hand-writing— looking at one Cross-examined Q Is it the same hand-writing as the letter A No he writes different hands—he has written William Smith 6s Commercial-road Lambeth MRS WOODDEN Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Are you related to the Buckingham family A I believe I am Lord Sheffield s great granddaughter—the gentleman who has now got the title has taken it from me—I am also related to the family of Lord Macclesfield—I remember Lord Macclesfield well and remember his coming to see me very well at my house in Lower Sloane-street—he asked to see the next house and I went and showed it him—we were not old acquaintances but my brother used to do all his business for him painting and glazing and I used to see him Q Are you entitled to the Macclesfield estates A If my father was and I survive him I must be—my father lived with a lady and he had two sons by her—my father s name was Clarke—he married one of Lord Sheffield s daughter and my father was Lord Sheffield s grandson—therefore I must be his great granddaughter—my father was a baronet and he left me his title but I never had it and into whose hands it has got I cannot say—he went by the name of Joseph Clarke but when Lord Sheffield died he had got his letters-patent and the arms on it—but my poor father died and did not take it up—I remember seeing them when I was a girl—he said My dear girl I won t have this yet —I saw his title when I was about twelve years old—he had it out of his desk—I said Let me look at that it is very pretty —he said No dear you shall have this by-and-bye —that was his title—I will swear that Q You had some acquaintance with Lord Shaftsbury I believe A Yes he lived in the house with us at Kensington Gravel-pits some time—he did not pay his addresses to me but I was informed he was an admirer of me—he never said any thing to me—I never quarrelled with him—I never had a word with him—I was going home one day and he overtook me on horseback and said My dear How would you like to have a husband Oh sir said I not recollecting him how would you like a careless wife —I did not think about a husband—that was my answer to him but it was very wrong—he paid no attention to me after that—my mother told me if any body spoke to me on the road never to notice them—I was about thirteen years old I believe when this occurred—I have a great quantity of forfeited property principally from an East India Captain named Josiah Price—I have not got it I have only heard of it—Lord Shaftsbury knows a great deal about it for he was left trustee of the Buckingham family—he knows more about my affairs than I know myself—I do not know what became of Captain Price—I am afraid he waa hanged from what I have heard but I am not sure—I did not get a halfpenny of the property—I heard I became entitled to some by his death—I knew him well—I cannot be sure he was hanged but I have heard something became of him that was not right—he never paid his addresses to me—he had got a lady and six or seven children—I heard I became entitled to his property through his misconduct to roe in my first husband s time—we parted—we did not agree and they wrote down disrespectfully of me to the Captain and I believe it was his intention to destroy me for he passed through my bed-room when I was in bed about one o clock in the morning with a knife in his hand—I was awake—I never saw any more of him till some time after a parcel of people got into my house making a riot and noise all night—there were upwards of forty of them and I saw him among them—I believe they would have shot me if they could—a great many people want me out of the way but I cannot tell what for—I do not know whether they want to kill me they want me out of the way—I never saw the Captain from the time I saw him with the knife till I saw him in my house with the forty people—that was about the time old queen Charlotte died—they were rioting and gamboling with the Captain among them—I cannot tell what they were doing—I had no business in the first floor of that apartment—these were upwards of forty of them and a great many of them were theatrical people and two boys named Searl wanted to shoot me—they had horse-pistols—I saw them—I think Mr Calvert helds possession of a great deal of my property—he has made a gentleman of his footman that was—he now holds the butler s place and now he has made him his private gentleman—that makes me think I am entitled to the property MR CLARKSON Q Have you ever received any property from any of the sources you think you are entitled to A Never a single sixpence—I suppose I am entitled to it from what people have told me and I have had them peeping through the doorway at me when I have been on business—I have not had conversation with the prisoner about these matters—I told him about the Macclesfield property and told him I thought there were fines also but I did not tell him about the Prices—my father s body was to be removed by the faculty to the vault of the Buckingham family THOMAS BRAND I am cashier in the house of Messrs Masterman Peters and Co On the 4th of April I received this £100 note at their banking-house—it was paid in by Mrs Woodden to be received by C Salmon at Brighton—I sent this letter of advice to Mr Wigney of the Brighton bank in consequence—the Brighton bankers correspond with us as their agents—by this letter they would have authority to pay the 100l to the order of C Salmon Cross-examined Q Has this note your hand-writing upon it A Yes of the particulars written at the moment I received it WILLIAM WIGNEY I am a clerk in the firm of Wigney & Co of Brighton—there are two partners—Mr Clement Wigney is one of them—Masterman and Co are our London correspondents On the 5th of April last I received this letter—it authorises us to pay 100l to C Salmon—the prisoner applied for the money the same day—he inquired whether we had a sum of money paid in to the name of Salmon—I referred to the letter and said yes—he stated that

the same with a like intent MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution SKIDMORE ASHBY I am one of the firm of Thomas Ashby Jun and others bankers at Staines The prisoner is a hay-dealer and lives at Upper Halliford near Sunbury—on the 22nd of March about three o clock he brought this bill of exchange and wished to know if we would discount it for him—we bad discounted several for him before with the same mark on them which were taken up by the prisoner—John Cole keeps an account with us—he had at that time a floating balance with us and we discounted the bill—I knew that Cole only put his mark to the cheques he drew and I paid the money to the prisoner Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q You say you discounted several when did that begin A I cannot say at all—this was the only one I discounted personally—I have seen one other bill and my partners told me there were more—I never heard that it commenced at the beginning of March 1888—I made no inquiry—they were all paid by the prisoner except this—this was not due when the prisoner was taken into custody— looking at some other bills —the receipts on the back of these bills were written by a son of one of the firm MR CLARKSON Q At the time these bills were in your house had you or any of the firm to your knowledge any suspicion that the purported acceptance of Cole was not his A We had of the previous bill to this but not of these

exchange looking at it on the 22nd of March—I did not owe the prisoner 60l or any thing at that time—I know nothing of this bill of exchange —I never authorized the prisoner to make my cross to it—I never authorized him to accept or draw a bill of exchange for me Cross-examined Q Or to put your name in any way A No—I swear that positively—he certainly did ask me to do something for him at a loan club at Sunbury but I said no—it is a club where persons can get 5l or 10l provided a responsible person will be bound for them and he asked me for my name—that is about eighteen months ago—I cannot say exactly—it was not the 3rd of March 1838—he asked me if so be he could make use of my name and I told him no—I do not know in what way he meant—I swear I never said I could not write but that he might put my name Q Do you remember going to him on the 3rd of March 1838 when he owed you some money and finding him standing against the stable A I cannot say the day of the month—we had some conversation on this side of the stable adjoining my house—I do not know whether he owed me any money at that time—I cannot say whether I received any money from him that evening—I do not recollect it—I cannot swear I did not—I know I let him have a little hay and certainly I was often backwards and forwards for the money—I did not tell him that I could not write and he might write my name on a bill and that would do as well—I can swear I did not—I do not recollect his telling me to come to his house that evening and he would pay me the money he owed me—I have seen the prisoner s son—he was not there on that occasion—I swear that—he was no where near us when we had the conversation—I cannot say whether I went to the prisoner the same evening—it is so long ago I cannot recollect all these little things—he never paid me any money and thanked me for allowing him to use my name—I did not say he was very welcome to it at any time if it was any good to him—I have kept money at Messrs Ashby s for several years—when I have a little money which I do not want I pay it in then and take it out when I want it MR CLARKSON Q Is there a club or any thing of that sort in Sunbury where by using the name of another man you can get a little money advanced A Yes I think they call it the loan club—the prisoner asked me if be might use my name to get a little money but I told him ho—I never authorized him to put my name to any bill of exchange at all WILLIAM COLE I am son of last witness lean write— looking at the bill —I did not write this Witness to the mark of John Cole William Cole nor any part of it—I do not know any thing about it—I never authorised the prisoner to do it for me or any thing else—I did not know such a bill was in existence till it was brought to my father JOHN ANNING I am a schoolmaster at Sunbury I know the prisoner In March last he came to me and asked me to draw up a bill of exchange for him—I did so—the body of this bill is my hand-writing—the words John Cole Sunbury have been introduced subsequent to my writing it—at that time neither Cole s or Pizzey s name were there—I cannot swear to the prisoner s writing—I have seen letters of his but I never saw him write or received letters from him myself Cross-examined Q How long have you known the prisoner A About a year and a half—I knew him by his children coming to ray school—I never heard

to sign his hand on a bit of paper for him—Cole said he could not write himself but if father would do it for him he was welcome to it—my father went and got the money—I think he had it from Staines—I did not go with him—Mr Cole came to our house the same evening and father paid him—he said at the time he paid him that be was very much obliged to him for what he had done for him—and Mr Cole said if that was any good to him he was welcome to it at any time—he was thanking him for signing his hand—it was mentioned what it was for—my father said he was very much obliged to him for signing his hand—and Mr Cole said he was welcome to it at any time if it was of any use to him—they were always very good friends as far as I know MR CLARKSON Q Where were you when your father was taken up A At work for Mr Swaile at Sunbury—I went home at night and went to work in the morning—I did not go before the Magistrate and state this—I was not asked to go—I should not have come here if I had not been asked—my mother told me I was to come here last Monday morning—my father had been in prison some time then—his trial was to have come on last Sessions but was postponed at his own request—I did not come on town then—I was at home and could have come if I had been asked—I go to school—I do not know that my father ever wanted to borrow money of this loan club at Sunbury—my father first asked Mr Cole to sign his hand and he said he might do it for him whenever he liked—he did not say for what amount—I did not hear any amount mentioned—he did not mention any sum—nobody has been taking down what I was to say when I came here—nobody has been asking me any questions about it—I swear that—I have seen nobody about it but my mother—she brought me up to town—my mother told me no more than what I heard my father say—she told me no more than as how I was to be here—she did not tell me my father would be transported if I did not come—she told me I was to come nothing else—I think she did tell

transported—she told me so last Monday evening—that was the first time she told me what to say—I was at home when my father was before the Magistrate—our house is nearly five miles from the Magistrate—I did not go that day—I went the second day and saw him at Staines when he came out from the Magistrate—I was not told to go in MR PAYNE Q Is it true that this conversation did take place between your father and Mr Cole near your stable A Yes—my mother did not tell me to say what I did not know—I knew myself what I heard my father say—she told me to state what I knew—if I had been called in to the Magistrate at Staines I should have given the same statement I have to-day COURT Q How near were you standing to Mr Cole when your father asked him this question A Within a yard of

day or two provide for it You will gain nothing by prosecuting me and your conscience will not be easy by doing so I have been flung on the world destitute friendless and without home make some allowance for my guilty conduct God has within the last forty-eight hours saved me from self-destruction I now see unless we pray to God and put our trust in him we shall never prosper Good bye God bless you Hoping Mrs Newth and you are well S —P S For God s sake do not let the bills be presented I have received 5l on it and the clothes I will return to you soon Please the Lord to forgive my conduct to you Witness I believe that letter to be his hand-writing—I have not seen him since I received it till he was taken—I do not recollect speaking to him about it—he did not tell me it was a person named Westbrook who was transported last Sessions that sent him the forged acceptance of Mr Newington—I had not sufficient time to talk to him about the letter—he talked to me wishing me not to prosecute—he asked me who it was informed me where he was and how I came to and him—I told him that the policeman fetched me to him—he did not mention the name of Westbrook to me at that time—he did before the Magistrate—he said that Westbrook had accepted the bills—he did not say west-brook owed him a sum of money that I know of—I did not hear him asked why Westbrook should send him Hannington s acceptance—we had no business to ask him questions—he was in the dock EDWARD WILLIAM NEWINGTON I am a tobacconist and lire in Fair-street Tooley-street I know the prisoner—I saw him on the evening of the 17th of June—he wished me to meet him next morning at Mr Newth s—I went there—he produced a bill accepted by Hannington—he told me he was engaged for a house as traveller which had bound him down not to put his name to any bill in any way that he most have money for his journey and he would trouble me to pot my name to this bill which I did—it was accepted by C Hannington made payable at Masterman s—I put my name to it as drawer—I do not know the handwriting of the acceptor at all Cross-examined Q Had you known the prisoner long A Three or four months—I know part of his family who are respectable—I have seen him a great many times—I was rather intimate with him—he lodged at Newth s a short time COURT Q Did not you think it strange that he should ask you to draw a bill on a man you did not know A I did it seeing the Letter from Hannington—it appeared to be so genuine—the bill was produced from that letter—I read the letter MR NEWTH re-examined This is the second bill Letter read — To Mr F Stone at Mr Newth s King-street Borough-Walworth Tuesday 18th June Sir If I lend you money you would not endeavour to repay me but I trust you will meet the enclosed if you can you have now

Wigney the Brighton banker —C HANNINGTON WILLIAM BENNETT I am a woollen-draper and live in High-street Southwark The bill accepted by Mr Fryer was brought to my house by Mr Newth—Mr Newth afterwards came to me with the prisoner and a letter which is not here—the prisoner spoke highly of Mr Fryer as a respectable man and asked me if I knew him—I said I did certainly and Mr Fryer s acceptance I should not hesitate to take and I may have said it was good as the Bank—a bill was afterwards brought to me purporting to be accepted by C Hannington—this is the bill—I advanced on it 5l —Newth owed me a larger sum of money than the amount of the bill Cross-examined Q It was Mr Newth brought you the bill accepted by Hannington A Yes—I lent him 5l on it COURT Q Was the prisoner present A Not the first time—he called the second time with Mr Newth when I agreed to advance 5l on Mr Fryer s bill—I lent 5l on each—it was on Newth s representation I advanced the 5l on the second bill MR NEWTH The letter alluded to by Mr Bennett was taken away JAMES ANDREWS police-constable M 45 I took the prisoner into custody—I told him he was charged by Mr Newth—he replied For God s sake don t let it go any further unless you wish me to go out of the country —Newth gave me the letters produced and I received the two bills which have been produced WILLIAM FRYER I am a warehouseman and live in the Crescent New Bridge-street Blackfriars The acceptance to this bill is not my handwriting—it is not the least like it—I know nothing of the prisoner—I never gave him authority to sign blank acceptances to a bill of exchange— read — London 12th June 1889 —Two months after date pay to my order the sum of £20 for value received THOMAS STONE Mr William Fryer fancy woollen-warehouseman 3 Crescent Bridge-street Blackfriars Accepted 3 Crescent New Bridge-street William Fryer Endorsed Thomas Stone A Newth CHARLES NEPHAN HANNINGTON I live in Penton-place Walworth The prisoner married my daughter—the acceptance to this other bill is not mine—it is nothing like my hand-writing—I always sign my name C N Hannington—I do not bank at Masterman s—this letter purporting to be written by C Hannington to the prisoner at Mr Newth s is not my writing—I never saw it before it was handed to me by Mr Newth—I never lived in North-street Brighton—I lived in Ship-street Brighton—they are near to each other MR PHILLIPS in behalf of the prisoner stated that the bills had seen to him by one Westbrook who was transported last Session GUILTY of Uttering Aged 26 — Transported for Seven Years

t18400203-760  760 JOHN HENCHER was again indicted for feloniously forging and uttering on the 16th of December an order for the payment of 6l with intent to defraud Thomas Ridgway JOHN CHARLES WILLS I am in the employ of Thomas Ridgway a tea-dealer in King William-street—he has no partner—the prisoner came to the shop on the 16th of December last between three and five o clock in the afternoon and ordered tea and coffee amounting to 1l 7s 4d to be sent to Dr J C Brown 1l New Broad-street—he gave me the order verbally and I took it down—he tendered this cheque for 6l in payment—he put it into my hand and said if I gave him the difference he would pay me at once—I took the cheque we sent it to the banker s and before the young man returned the prisoner said he was going to Abchurch-lane and would return in a few minutes if I would get the difference ready—he did not return—I found him in custody in about a fortnight or three weeks—I held him in conversation a short time before he left the shop—I am sure he is the person to the best of my knowledge—I did not ask him any question about the cheque—I did not know the person by whom it appears to be drawn Prisoner Q By what are you prepared to swear to me A From your light complexion and light hair—I will not be certain whether the shop-lamps were alight or not—I cannot say whether the person was at all aware that I sent the cheque to the banker s—I sent a young man named Jenner—the person did not see me give the cheque to Jenner—he could not be aware that I had sent it to the banker s—the banker s is in Corn-hill not a quarter of a mile from our house—I held the person in conversation after giving the cheque to Jenner—I should say three or four minutes elapsed before the person left the shop—T cannot say how long it would take a person to go to the banker s I am a stranger in the neighbourhood—when the person left his manner did not appear at all excited or such as to cause my suspicion in the least COURT Q How long from first to last was the person with you A Five or six minutes—I had some conversation with him after I took the cheque—there was only the counter between us—I cannot charge my memory whether the gas was lighted—it was quite light enough for me to discern his person—I noticed that he had a very long nose a very light complexion and light hair—I saw him again about a fortnight or three weeks after at the station-house in custody—I am confident the prisoner is the man WILLIAM CHURCHILL This cheque is signed J C Brown and is on Fuller and Co —I have no doubt it is the prisoner s writing RIDCHARD DOHERTY I am a policeman I have made inquiry for a person named Brown at No 11 Broad-street but no such person resided there—I inquired about the neighborhood—I asked the person at No 11 if he was acquainted with a person of that name in the street—he said he was not—I did not inquire at any other house— cheque read— Messrs Fuller and Co Pay petty cash or bearer 6l J C Brown 16th December 1839 Prisoner s Defence The witness swears to me by my nose and complexion—is there any thing peculiarly striking in my complexion —it is for you to judge—he swears the person entered the premises between three and five o clock—he cannot tell whether the gas was lit or not—we all know between three and five o clock it is approaching dusk and to identify a person by his complexion would be attended with considerable difficulty—the person remained in conversation with him not being aware of the cheque being sent to the banker s two or three minutes—the distance he cannot tell but perhaps gentlemen you know the spot and will decide whether a person would run the risk of being apprehended on the charge by remaining in conversation with a person four or five minutes which would be ample time for a person to reach the banker s and the moment he presented the cheque he would necessarily ascertain it to be forged and make the best of his way back so that the person had time to reach the banker s and return while I was in conversation with him as he says—I am also indicted for obtaining goods from Messrs Twining on the same day and if your Lordship will look into the deposition you will find what time the witness says I was there and if it was between three and five o clock it will necessarily appear that I could not be there and at Twining s at the same hour obtaining goods HENRY JONES I am clerk to Messrs Twining I have no knowledge of the prisoner—a person came to our shop—I do not know that it was the prisoner GUILTYof uttering Aged 25 — Transported for Life There were five other indictments against the prisoner Before Mr Justice Williams

t18400406-1200  1200 JOHN TURNER FLINN was indicted for feloniously forging and uttering a certain document relating to the payment of and the obtaining of certain prize money due on account of military service performed by one George Langly with intent to defraud the Lords Commissioners of Chelsea Hospital —Other COUNT varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution RICHARD BELLAMY I am senior clerk in the Prize Department at Chelsea Hospital and have been so more than twenty-three years I have the prize-list referring to the capture of Buenos Ayes—there are the sums of 110l 9s 2d 43l 5s 11 1/2 d and 20l 1s 1/2 d returned as being due to George Langly—there were three distributions of shares—they are returned as due to Sergeant Langly of the St Helena Infantry in respect to the capture of Buenos Ayres in 1806—these shares remained unpaid until August 1835 and unclaimed until a short period before that—up to August 1835 the money was in the hands of the Commissioners of Chelsea Hospital—it had been paid into the hospital—the first payment was in 1809 the second in 1810 and the third in April 1813—by the act of parliament regulating the hospital prize-money is forfeited if not claimed within six years of the time of its being paid into the hospital it is the custom however of the Commissioners to pay the amount to the parties or their representatives if they give reasonable excuse for the delay—in April 1835 this petition was received at the hospital The petition was here read dated Nantes April 1 1835 signed George Langly directed to the Honourable Governors of Chelsea Hospital and stating that George Langly late sergeant of the St Helena Artillery had in 1817 while at Plymouth given to Mr Johnson an assignment to receive his prize-money for the capture of Buenos Ayres in July 1806 under General Whitelock that shortly after granting the assignment he the said George Langly proceeded to America had since become naturalized and was unable to investigate the proceedings of Johnson that he had frequently written to him without receiving any reply that in 1828 or 1829 he authorized hit brother to make inquiries about hit prize-money who upon his application at Chelsea Hospital was informed that Johnson was dead that application had been made at the East India House when it was found that the prize-money had been paid into Chelsea Hospital and the petitioner hoped he might be allowed to receive the amount before he returned to America and requested commands to be forwarded to the petitioner to the care of Monsieur L Feuvre French Consul at Southampton RICHARD BELLAMY continued This certificate accompanied the petition—an answer to this was sent on the 7th of April 1835 stating that no prize-money had been paid into the Hospital for the capture of Buenos Ayres under General Whitelocke—there bad been no prize-money due to any body with respect to the expedition under General White lock—the answer was addressed to Sergeant George Langly United States Service Nantes care of Mr L Feuvre French Consul Southampton —This petition dated Nantes 21st May 1835 came to the Hospital afterwards — This petition was the same in substance as the former one but describing the petitioner George Langly at a sergeant of the St Helena Infantry instead of Artillery —An answer to the second petition of which this is a copy was sent on the 12th of June 1835— This being read stated that prize-money amounting to 177l 16s 11d had been forfeited to the Hospital in 1819 in consequence of not being claimed within the period allotted by Act of Parliament but in consequence of the circumstances stated in the petition the forfeiture was remitted and an order enclosed for the petitioner to execute in favour of any body he might appoint to receive it Witness The order enclosed was sent in blank—this second communication was also addressed to the care of Mr L Feuvre Southampton—at that time the letters that went out from the Hospital were always franked—I was in attendance at the Hospital when this order filled up as it is now was presented for payment—it was paid on the 24th of August—I do not know of its being presented before—I do not recollect its being presented on the 20th—it was presented by Mr Theleure on the 24th and the amount was paid to him by a cheque of the deputy-treasurer on the Bank of England—I have seen Mr Theleure since and believe him to be the person—I have known the prisoner several years—he has come several times for prize-money and was acquainted with the mode of proceeding in such cases Cross-examined by MR JONES Q You had known him I suppose as a lieutenant in the navy A I knew him as coming to the office on official business as Lieutenant Flinn—he was called Sir John Flinn shortly after the trial of Queen Caroline—I do not know whether he was attached to her household—I do not know whether he has been a great many years in the navy—I only know it from the Navy List—I never knew an instance of officers acting as prize-agents except in the army prize-money—I am not aware of officers both in the army and navy acting as prize agents—there is no restriction that I am aware of—I do not know that he took out a licence as a prize-agent—we did not make any inquiry after we received the first petition because no money could possibly be paid on it as Langley was described to be in the Artillery—I only know from the returns in our office that there was such a regiment as the St Helena Artillery—my suspicion was not excited when the second petition arrived stating he was in the Infantry—there was nothing in the second petition alluding to the first and the first did not pass through my hands— I knew nothing of it—I have not inquired at the Admiralty or any other public office about George Langly—I do not know that inquiries have been made—when a person writes claiming prize-money we generally send a printed form for them to identify themselves COURT Q Do not you inquire whether there is such a person as the man who asks you for 170l odd A At that time it was not usual MR JONES Q When you receive a letter do you pay the money A We send a printed form to be filled up and when we receive that the money is paid—that has been the practice of the office for some years—we had a clerk named Holgate in the office—he is not a clerk now—there has been a reduction in the number of clerks which was the only reason of his leaving—he left in March 1837—we often have application made by prize-agents and other parties on the subject of prize-money MR BODKIN Q Was Holgate discharged previous to any discovery of the present transaction A Yes—this is the receipt Mr Theleure gave for the money when paid Read — 177l 16s 11d At seven days sight pay to Monsieur E A Theleure or order the amount of share of prize or bounty-money due to me in respect of my service as Sergeant of the St Helena Infantry at the capture of Buenos Ayres in June 1806 —GEORGE LANGLY —At the foot of the above was a certificate signed Jacques Minister and Doria elder dated 16th July 1835 stating that they had examined the said George Langly and from documents produced and answers given by him they believed he was serving in the above regiment at the time of the capture and was discharged on or about the 30th of November 1814 and that be now resided at Nantes HENRY SAMUEL DALLER I am a clerk in the paymaster-general s office All orders for prize-money from Chelsea-hospital are paid at the paymaster s office—in 1835 I was a clerk in the prize department at Chelsea Hospital—I remember this order being brought to the office for payment—it was first brought I think on the 24th of August by Mr Theleure—I do not recollect whether it was brought before the day it was paid GEORGE ROWLAND HOLGATE I was a clerk in the prize-office at Chelsea Hospital in April 1835—I continued there till the beginning of 1837 when there was a reduction of clerks and I was put on a superannuation allowance—it was my duty to answer the applications of persons for prize-money and for that purpose I had access to the prize lists which would show the regiments and the persons belonging to them entitled to receive prize-money which was not already received—the prisoner was in the habit of coming to the Hospital in 1835 and before that—he had the opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of the mode in which business was done—I know Beresford Eaton he has been a navy agent—I had seen Mr Flinn repeatedly as an applicant for prize-money and I was introduced to him by Mr Eaton more intimately—I entered into an arrangement with Mr Eaton and Lieutenant Flinn about information to be given by me with respect to prize-money—the agreement in the first instance was to furnish the names of some soldiers entitled to Diamante prize-money—Diamante is on the coast of Calabria—I was to receive two and a half per cent for the information I furnished in that case—it was merely for giving information whether they got any thing or not—after that I saw the prisoner more frequently—there was afterwards an arrangement made between Mr Eaton and myself on the subject of information as to the names of officers who were entitled to prize-money—that occasionally included non-commissioned officers—it was about persons entitled to prize-money of right and also which had been forfeited by the lapse of time—I was to have five per cent for that—I received a per-centage from Mr Flinn himself on one occasion—I have frequently received a percentage from Mr Eaton—among other names which I furnished to Mr Eaton I gave him the same of George Langly a sergeant in the St Helena infantry and also the amount of prize-money he was-entitled to Q Was there at the time you furnished the information any document in the office to which you belonged by which you knew that Langley was dead A There was occasionally in the prize lists a mark but I do not recollect distinctly whether there was a mark against Langly s name in the prize-list or not—I was to have a per-centage for the information I furnished respecting Langly if the money was received—the five per-cent was only in case of the receipt of the money—I saw the prisoner at Mr Eaton s shortly before the money was received—he asked me if application had been made for the St Helena sergeant s money—I told him I did not think it had—he told me to look out for if application had not been already made it would shortly be made—I remember paying that money at the hospital—I took the receipt for the money and gave a cheque for the amount—I saw Mr Theleure—I cannot say whether he is the person to whom it was paid it is so long since—I saw the prisoner again shortly after the payment of the money—I mentioned the circumstance of the money being paid expecting a commission—I mentioned it first to Mr Eaton and afterwards to Mr Flinn at Mr Eaton s house—he asked to whom the money was paid—in consequence of some inquiry made by Mr Eaton or Mr Flinn I examined the book to see who it was paid to—I found it out by means of a card I believe—I told Mr Flinn it was paid to a man named Theleure—he said he knew nothing about it—I have teen the prisoner write frequently and think the receipt endorsed on this paper is his hand-writing Cross-examined Q How long were you in the office at the Hospital A I went in 1821 and left in 1837—it was Mr Eaton who first applied to me for information respecting prize-money—the first proposal was made about the Diamante prize-money—the first offer made to me was 5l —I declined that and said I would do it at a per-centage—Mr Eaton made that offer for the information respecting the Diamante prize-money—Mr Eaton frequently paid me a per-centage—I should think I have received from Mr Eaton 500l or 600l altogether—my salary as clerk was 110l a year at first and then 120l —I had no undertaking with any prize agent but Mr Eaton for giving information I swear that—I have taken this per-centage for the last five or six years that I was in the office—I never received any money from any agent except Mr Eaton Q I presume it is quite in accordance with the rules of the office that clerks were allowed to give information and receive a per-centage A No it is contradictory to the rules of the office—none of the other clerks knew of that arrangement of mine to my knowledge—I did not tell them of it—I did not receive any letter about Langly nor did I see it—I was not aware the application had been made until the money was demanded—I had nothing to do with the corresponding department—I did not refer to any book to ascertain whether the man was dead before I paid the money —I will swear it—it is possible if there was a mark of dead against that name on the list I might have put that mark but I certainly never referred—I took the name from a book before the money was paid and entered it in a private memorandum-book of my own—I do not know whether the mark of dead —was against it then— looking at the original book —there is no mark against that same—this is the book I copied the memorandum from—I do not think any body was present but Mr Eaton Mr Flinn and myself when he asked me about the sergeant s prize-money—I have never received any per-centage on that money—I did not ask Mr Eaton for it—I mentioned the circumstance to him when the money was paid and he said he had not received it—I then mentioned it to Mr Flinn and he said he knew nothing about it—I should think it is eight or nine months back that I was first applied to for information as to this it is since I have left the office—I think I then told all I knew as I have to-day—I told it shortly afterwards—MR Bicknell the solicitor applied to me—I wrote to him and gave him the information—I first saw him personally and told him I had abstracted some names and into whose hands I placed them—I think I mentioned Lieut Flinn s name in my letter to Mr Bicknell but not in my first interview nor Mr Eaton s—there was a suspicion against me—I do not think I have been threatened with a prosecution in respect to this transaction—there were several cases of this sort—whether this is one of which they entertained suspicion against me I do not know Q Have you been generally threatened with a prosecution on account of the part you took in these transactions A Why yes perhaps—I believe I have but I did not understand you distinctly—I know I have acted in breach of my duty contrary to Act of Parliament and believe it is in the power of the Hospital to punish me—I believe I have not been threatened that I should be prosecuted and punished—there has never been a distinct threat made to me—I do not think Mr Bicknell has ever said any thing distinctly to me about prosecuting me for it—he has certainly told me what he could do but never told me I will do it that I recollect—he has told me I am liable to be punished—I told Mr Bicknell that I had received 500l or 600l for per-centage—he is perfectly acquainted with that—he has seen it from my own memorandum and I have admitted it—Mr Bicknell has my private memorandums—I did not give them to him—they were taken from me—my house was searched I think last May or June the same day that Mr Bicknell saw me I think—I was not at home at the time—it was after that that I wrote to Mr Bicknell on the subject—I wrote to him shortly after giving him an account of the transaction it was not so full an account as I afterwards gave him—I think in December I gave him the fullest account—that referred to a great number of other cases—he urged me to tell him all I knew MR CLARKSON Q I believe you were in confinement for debt at the time the discovery was first made A Yes—I wrote a letter to my wife desiring her to deliver up my papers—they contained a detailed account of the per-centage I had received—I believe it is the custom of the Navy agents to hunt up the relatives of deceased persons and assist them to receive the money that they may have the commission—I had not the least conception of any fraud or forgery contemplated by this or I would not have done it COURT Q Did you furnish the names of persons dead as well as not dead A Yes—I furnished the names indiscriminately whether they were alive or dead—I generally communicated the fact of their being marked as dead because in discovering the representatives it would facilitate the investigation to find the relatives MR CLARKSON Q At the time you made any communication to Mr Bicknell and when you were aware you had been guilty of a breach of duty in your office were you at all aware that this case of Langley s had been discovered as a forgery A No I was not MR JONES Q Did you give any information to a Mr Baker A The information was given to Mr Eaton and he gave it to Baker—it was by my acquiescence—I communicated the information to Eaton for him to communicate it to Baker BERESFORD EYTON I was formerly a navy-agent in London I have known the prisoner for upwards of twenty years—I knew him to be engaged in forwarding the applications of persons for prize-money to Chelsea Hospital—I recollect his doing so with reference to the Diamante prize-money—I know Mr Holgate—he Mr Flinn and myself were in the habit of meeting together on the subject of prize-money—a verbal arrangement was come to with respect to information given—the prisoner was to allow us ten per cent on any claims where he was the means of discovering the representative or the parties themselves—the ten per cent was to be equally divided between Holgate and myself—I was to give him the names—I had the name of George Langly of the St Helena regiment from Mr Holgate—I entered in a book the claims which were promoted between us and the amounts due to the parties—I was told by Mr Holgate that the money due to Langly had been paid by the hospital—I cannot tell the time—it was immediately after it was paid—he requested me to apply to the prisoner for the per-centage which I did—he said he had nothing to do with it or something to that effect and the matter dropped—I did not speak to him about it further to my knowledge—he did not pay me the ten per cent —in 1835 I believe the prisoner was residing at St Servan in France—I had letters from him there—he told me he had a house there—a young person named Jane Maria Faulkner was living there—she was not particularly under my care—I was executor to her grandmother—the prisoner applied to me to recommend him a nurse-maid and I recommended her—I received letters from her while she lived in the prisoner s family—she is now married—her name is Gee—I believe she is alive—I have not seen her lately—I am acquainted with her handwriting— looking at the two petitions —I believe these to be her handwriting—I do not allude to the enclosures—I have no doubt of both of her them—I believe this part of the order written in the margin to be writing—I am not so positive as to Monsieur Theleure but I think there is a great similarity—I believe it to be hers—I do not personally know Messrs Johnson navy-agents of Plymouth—I know there is such a concern—I have no knowledge of their being concerned with the prisoner in business transactions—he is frequently in London—I do not know which way he came—I know he went by Jersey to St Malo Cross-examined Q Are you still a navy-agent A No—I am sorry to say I have been unfortunate—I was a bankrupt two years ago—I have known Holgate about seven years—I had no transactions with him except in prize-money—I believe he left the hospital in 1837—I had had transactions with him in prize-money I should think for four years before that—I frequently paid him a per-centage Q Did you know whether that was consistent with the rules of the office or against them A I do not know how to answer that question—I believe it was not publicly allowed to be done—it is against the regulations of the office to give the names or any information—I knew he ought not to give the names—I have paid him I should think between four and five hundred pounds—sometimes I paid him two and a half percent and sometimes five never more—the per-centage depended on the recent capture—I have had communications with him since he left the hospital—I have kept up my acquaintance with him—I have not visited him since he left the hospital—we have not been private friends within the last six months—up to that time we have been acquainted—Mr Bicknell first applied to me for information on this subject in November last when I was summoned to Bow-street—I did not give all the information I possessed at once—Holgate was present at the time I was at Bow-street—I was examined as a witness—I have been with Mr Bicknell several times—I have not been in communication with Holgate on the subject until to-day—we have talked on various subjects to-day and not at all since November till to-day—I went to see him five or six times when he was in prison for debt—he mentioned at one time that there was a charge against him about the prize-money—he did not tell me he was afraid of being prosecuted—he told me he was suspected of being the party—that was shortly before he left prison—I went and saw him after he told me that—I saw him half-a-dozen times altogether—how often I went after that I cannot tell—he wrote to me saying he wanted to see me—it was not on this case at all—it was on the subject of the supposed frauds or forgeries or whatever they are—I went to him—he told me he was suspected of being the party committing the fraud—I called to see him as a friend—the last time I saw Mrs Gee was three or four years ago—the last letters from her are in 1836 or 1837—I do not know where she is living now—I have heard she is at Southampton but I do not know it—I know the prisoner has been in the navy about thirty-seven years—I believe he entered in 1804—I know he has been in a good many engagements—he had the reputation of being a brave and gallant officer—I knew him in the service of Queen Caroline—I do not know of his being engaged by the government in confidential missions—I know he was agent to Count Ludolph for a considerable time in obtaining foreign prize-money—he had a license as prize-agent in this country MR BODKIN Q Do you know whether he had a license in 1835 A The license was granted in 1831 and expired in 1834—he had none in 1835—at the time I saw Holgate in prison I was not at all aware that any discovery had been made of this case of Langly—the letters I received from Mrs Gee went with the rest of my papers into the hands of the official assignee under my estate—my attention was called to these letters yesterday and I was afterwards shown these documents which I believe to be her hand-writing—that was the first time I had seen them— looking at a letter —this is the last letter I received from Mrs Gee—this is not from her but her writing is on it—the body of the letter is the handwriting of the prisoner—it came by private hand—I received it in 1836 JOHN BIRD I have been a clerk in the War-office Cross-examined Q How many years have you known Lieutenant Flinn A Fifteen or sixteen years up to the present time—he lodged in my house in March twelvemonth from the beginning of 1838—he has always borne the character of a respectable honourable man to my knowledge and belief EDWARD ALLCOCK THELEURE I am a dancing-matter My father and mother s name it Taylor but for the purposes of my profession I have taken the name of Theleure—I have known the prisoner since 1832—I became acquainted with him by giving him lessons in dancing—I continued acquainted with him up to 1835—I left this country to go to St Germain s some time after 1835—I resided there when I received a communication from Chelsea Hospital—I gave an answer to the inquiry and have come over to this country to substantiate it—in 1835 I lived at No 46 Great Marlborough-street—it was there the prisoner occasionally took lessons of me—I was in the habit of seeing him in June July and August that year—he was then living at No 14 Great Charlotte-street Blackfriars-road—at that time he told me he was in the habit of going to and from the continent—he told me he lived at St Malo s—in 1835 I was in the habit of keeping a diary of my transactions day by day—I have it here— looking at it —I had no acquaintance of the name of Le Brun living at Nantes on the 20th of August that year nor did I know any such person as George Langly—this letter— looking at one —came to me by the post on the 20th of August I believe about ten or twelve o clock—it has the post-mark of that date—it contained this order—I saw the prisoner immediately after I had received the letter—I had the letter in my hand or an the table when he came—I put it into his hands and he said Oh that is perfectly correct —he had not mentioned any thing about prize-money to me previously but he had asked me to receive any monies for him as he was in the habit of going out of town—I said Certainly —he did not mention where I was to go to receive them—he offered me a commission which I refused as it was not my business—I agreed to do it as a friend—I had no acquaintance at Nantes named Le Brun—I told him so and that I did not know Langly or Le Brun—I showed him the letter and he immediately said Oh that is perfectly correct the money you are to receive and I have an order to receive it of you —he said I was to go and receive the money at Chelsea Hospital—I offered to take him with me—he said he was particularly engaged and he could not go with me and asked me to go alone and receive it—I offered to take him in my vehicle Q Did you receive back from the prisoner the letter and order A Yes—I went alone to the Hospital that day—the answer I received was that it was quite correct and I was to return on Monday—I made a memorandum on the paper in consequence of that—here is in about three days time —that is the memorandum I made on receiving that answer at the Hospital—I did not see the prisoner when I came back the first time—I have no note of it in my book—he came on the 21st—I have nothing entered here merely that he called—I told him what had passed and the answer I got—on the 24th I went to the Hospital again with the order and received a cheque for the money—this is the receipt I gave for the 177l 16s 11d — read— Received of W H Spicer Esq Deputy Treasurer 177l 16s 11d being the amount of prize-money due to George Langly &c E A THELESURE —I saw the prisoner altar I received the cheque the same day at my house—I told him I was ready to pay him the money if he would give me a receipt for it—he said he had not got a receipt with him but he would bring it—this is the cheque I received— looking at it —he asked me if I was going into the City would I get the money—I said Yes —I took the cheque received the money at the Bank and gave him the money on the 26th—he then gave me this paper— looking at it —there is some writing of his on it—it purports to be a receipt of Langly—I would not pay him without his receipt and I saw him write his name and address on the back—I was never at Nantes in my life—I heard nothing more of this till I received Mr Bicknell s communication when I was living in France—I believe this letter is the hand-writing of the prisoner— looking at one —I received it from him Cross-examined Q Do I understand you do not know any person of the name of Le Burn A Yes not at Nantes—my gardener s name is Le Brun at St Germain s—I did not know a person of that name at that time—it is a very common name in France—I was brought up in France and have lived there ten or fifteen years—I have no recollection of the name of Le Brun except my gardener and a dancing-master who lived at St Germain s—I have seen him I suppose once or twice—the prisoner said at once that he had an order to receive the money of me—I said so before the Magistrate—all I wanted was an acknowledgment of his having received the money—I was well aware it was like a bill of exchange and I must receive some order to receive it—I had not seen the receipt till he brought it to me on the 26th—I had not seen the order before I paid him the money—I should have thought twice before I paid him on his own receipt without having the receipt of George Langly—I will swear at the time I showed him the letter that I told him I did not know either George Langly or Le Brun—I do not know that he made any observation upon that Q As it was by his authority you went to receive the money why should not you be content with his acknowledgment A Because the letter was signed George Langly —if the prisoner had asked me to receive the money I might have been content with his receipt but as it was a letter from George Langly I thought I ought to have his receipt COURT Q Are you sure that at the first interview he told you he had an order to receive the money A Perfectly—that induced me to expect him to show me the order before I paid it to him—I wished to see the order as he said he had one MR JONES Q Did he give you any other acknowledgment for the money than that order A No I am certain—he did not give me a receipt written by himself on a separate piece of paper The cheque was here read which was on the Bank of England for 177l 16s 11d signed W H Spicer and endorsed E A Theleure 46 Great Marlborough-street MR CLAKSON Q You had a gardener named Le Brun and knew a dancing-master of that name in St Germain s did you become acquainted with both of them after you received this money A Yes very lately—I was not acquainted with any Le Brun or Langly who knew the initials of my Christian name BERESFORD EATON re-examined I believe this letter to be the handwriting of Mrs Gee JOHN LOCKEY I am an out-pensioner of Chelsea Hospital and live at Glasgow I was in the St Helena regiment at the taking of Buenos Ayres in 1806 under the command of General Beresford—I knew George Langly a sergeant in the corps—he was the only person of that name in the regiment—we remained there from the 1st of June till the 27th of August—in November 1807 Langly died on board his Majesty s ship Woolwich on the voyage back to St Helena—I was present at his death and assisted at his funeral Cross-examined Q Was he a married man A No WILLIAM JAMES L FEUVRE I was the French Consular agent at Southampton in 1835—I had a clerk in my service then who is since dead—I know the prisoner—I remember a letter coming to my establishment free of postage—it was directed to my care for an individual in France—I do not recollect the name—in consequence of a communication from my clerk I gave directions about the delivery of that letter—after that and on the same day I saw the prisoner—I mentioned to him that I had given directions that he should have the letter if he called a second time at my office and he gave me to understand that he had received it—I was superintendent of the Ariadne steam-vessel going to Jersey—I knew the prisoner occasionally went to and fro to Jersey at that time—Captain Basaam commanded that vessel—he is since dead—he was captain on that station—the prisoner occasionally travelled by that vessel and knew Captain Bassam intimately Cross-examined Q Can you undertake to say he said he had received the letter A I understood him that he had received it—I cannot recollect his words—I should not know that letter again if I saw it—I think I received one letter for him afterwards but I do not think I did before—I will not be positive that I had not—I know Mrs Gee—she is living at Southampton now—I saw her last Sunday—there would be no difficulty in bringing her here—I put the question to her on Sunday whether she was likely to come up—I pat that question to her in consequence of what I heard from somebody connected with the prosecution not Mr Bicknell—it was in consequence of a letter I received—I did not communicate her answer to Mr Bicknell—I am not aware that I ever told Mr Bicknell the answer I received from her—I received a letter from Mr Bicknell on Sunday morning—I have seen him since then—I saw him on Tuesday MR CLARKSON Q Have you got the letter with you A I have not—my conversation with Mrs Gee had no reference to the hand-writing of any papers here—I think the letter I received afterwards was addressed to Mr Flinn—the one I spoke to my clerk about was not addressed to Mr Flinn but to an individual in France but Mr Flinn represented that it was for a friend of his and asked to take it REV FRANCES HAWKINS I am a Catholic priest I have lived in the city of Nantes some time—I resided there in 1835—I knew the Catholic clergy there at that time—I have heard a great deal about the Protestant clergy but did not know them personally—I never heard of a Catholic or Protestant clergyman named Jacques—there is no elder in our religion—I never heard of a person of the name of Doria in any of the churches established at Nantes RICHARD BASSETT I am a clerk in the Bank of England I have an entry of the numbers of the notes given in exchange for this cheque on the 25th of August 1835— No 8999 100l dated 1st August No 16975 28th July 50l No 19871 30th July 20l No 4807 1st August 5l THOMAS PHILLIPS I produce these notes which have been paid into the Bank of England—on the back of the 5l notes is written Thomas Dyson Ludolph and on the back of the 20l note E Cole 28th August JOHN BICKNELL I am solicitor of the Lords Commissioners of Chelsea Hospital The first time I heard of the hand-writing in question being identified was at five o clock yesterday afternoon Cross-examined Q Did you know before five o clock yesterday that Mrs Gee was living at Southampton A I did not know there was such a person in existence as Mrs Gee—I heard there was a servant of Mr Flinn s at Southampton but never heard the name of Faulkner or Gee COURT Q Your correspondence with Mr Lefevre had no reference to Mrs Gee A None at all The letter from Nantes enclosing the order received by Theleure was as follows Nantes 16th July 1835 Sir I have the honour to request that you will do me the favour in consequence of your friend s recommendation Monsieur Le Bran at Nantes to call at the Deputy Treasurer s office at Chelsea Hospital to receive my share of prize-money for captures as authorised by the Lords Commissioners on the 12th ultimo I have the honour to remain &c GEORGE LANGLY Monsieur E A Theleure 46 Great Marlborough-street London The receipt given by the prisoner to Theleure on the 26th was as follows 177l 16s 11d Nantes July 1835 At one month after date please to pay to my order 177l 16s 11d being the amount of my share of prize-money received by Mr Theleure after deducting his expenses and for which this shall serve as a receipt in full of all demands GEORGE LANGLY And on the back was written

uttering with like intent —Other COUNTS stating it to be with intent to defraud Robert Alexius Pope MESSRS BODKIN and JERNINGHAM conducted the Prosecution JOSEPH HAY I am a clerk in the banking-house of Messrs Wright In March 1837 the Rev Mr Pope kept an account at our house—this cheque looking at it was presented at our house on the 4th of March 1837—I cannot say that I recollect the person who presented it—I paid the 200l for which it is drawn—this 10l note No 5128 dated 15th December 1836 is one of the notes I paid and this 20l note No 8132 dated 27th January 1837 was also paid at that time—here is one name written on each note of a customer of the bank—on the 20l note there is also something like the name of Alcock and on the 10l note also—this 20l note No 8133 dated 27th January 1837 is also one of the notes that was paid Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Is the name on the front or the back of the notes A On the front of one and the back of the other—I think it looks something like the name of Alcock—the impression on my mind is that it is Alcock Q Is it your custom to pay a cheque dated in the country without a stamp A I was not to know that it was drawn in the country—I ascertain where a cheque is drawn from the place whence it is dated—I do not think I knew where Mount Carmel-house was at that time—I now understand it is in Worcestershire—I never heard of such a house within ten miles of London but there are many houses in London which I do not know—I do not think I observed the place at all where it was drawn—we very seldom have time to read the whole of a cheque—I know that cheques drawn in the country should bear a stamp—I do not always read the whole of a cheque—I cannot call to mind whether or not I read the whole of this—MR Pope has been a customer of Messrs Wright perhaps two or three years but I do not know—I have paid some cheques of his not many—he has not been in the habit of drawing many—I have paid cheques in favour of Alcock—I should say one or two from memory—I thought this to be Mr Pope s writing or I should not have paid it—I think now that there is a great similarity so much as induced me to pay it—I should say it was Mr Pope s writing certainly from the similarity of the character in general without close inspection but when I have Mr Pope s own cheques put before me and compare it it is a different thing—there is then a discrepancy—I believe it is usual for Mr Pope to have the name of the banker in a different handwriting to the other part of the cheque—I do not recollect whether it was a man woman or child I paid the money to—I have the numbers and dates of the notes entered in my book—I entered them when I paid them away and have the books here MR JERNINGHAM Q By what part of a cheque do you generally judge of its validity A From the name—I considered it to be genuine at the time JAMES CROSBY I am a solicitor practising in London and live in Church-Court Old Jewry I became acquainted with the prisoner in I think 1836—he was introduced to me by a client of mine named Latchford—I made inquiry about some property it was supposed he and others were entitled to—I found there was an old suit pending in Chancery respecting it—I had occasion to expend some money in the object of my inquiry—I received from the prisoner at various times 100l altogether—in January 1837 I had occasion to go down to Redditch in Worcestershire and there saw Mr Pope—I had seen seen him in January the preceding year—I communicated with him respecting the proceedings I had taken and in consequence of what I heard from Mr Pope in 1837 I made application to the prisoner—in consequence of what transpired between me and Mr Pope the prisoner was sent for to Mr Pope s—he was living at Redditch at the time—a great deal of conversation took place as to monies he had obtained from Mr Pope—MR Pope said in his presence that he had obtained 495l —the prisoner promised to repay it—he never did repay it to my knowledge—in March the same year I was deputed by Wrights the bankers and other persons to go to France—I found the prisoner at Paris and had conversations with him on the subject of his affairs and the claims against him Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did you act as his attorney at that time A No—I acted as attorney to the parties interested in the suit but he was not a party to the suit—I did act as his attorney—I never gave him notice of my discontinuing to act as his attorney—he had run away and I could not—I had only been concerned in one action for him MR BODKIN Q At the time he left England had you any business of his in which you were acting as his attorney A I had had one action on a bill of exchange in which he was plaintiff—it was alleged that he had forged it—a rule is now pending for a new trial which is not disposed of Q Did you receive the 100l you had from the prisoner as client or in what capacity A I considered him as agent for the various claimants—they were numerous—I went to France as representing Messrs Wright Pope and Latchford—the forgery of this cheque had been discovered and on seeing the prisoner I represented what I came about—I told him I was desirous of getting back some of the money he had taken away with him—he said he had none—I asked him what he had done with the 200l that he had got by forging Mr Pope s name at Wright s—he gave me some details which I wrote on the back of a letter in pencil—this is the memorandum I made— looking at it —he said he had sent 20l to Milward 20l to Whitehouse 20l to Mrs Alcock 20l to Ferrell 10l to Emmett 10l to the Thatched-tavern and 10l to things pledged—that amounts to 110l —I do not remember that he gave me any further account—I returned to England leaving him there—I saw him again on the 14th of April this year in Cateaton-street City—I said Is that you Alcock —he said How do you do Mr Crosby —I said I want you to go with me to Messrs Wright s —he said What for —I said About the forgery —he said he would not go—I then asked him to go to Mr Latchford s—he said he would not go there—I told him if he did not go to one place or the other with me I would give him in charge of a policeman—he then walked away—I followed him and again persuaded him to go to Wright s or Latchford s but he declined doing so—at last he said he would but he walked in a contrary direction—and as I saw he did not intend to go I gave him into charge of a policeman in Moorgate-street—he said I I could not give him in charge I had no warrant—the policeman took him to Cripplegate station-house where I stated the charge—he said first of all Now pray Mr Crosby let me go with you to Latchford s or to Wright s pray let me go —he did not say that aloud—I told him I could do nothing in it I had given him the chance—I was detailing the charge that he had forged a cheque and he said pointing to me And that is the villain that has had the money —I have frequently seen him write MR CLARKSON Q Have you seen him write when he has been a client of yours A Yes he has frequently written letters in my office—I do not know whether that was before I brought the action I refer to or not—I should think it was before MR BODKIN Q Look at this cheque whose hand-writing do you believe it to be A I believe the whole of it to be in the prisoner s hand-writing except the words Wright and Co —I believe these two letters also to be his hand-writing— looking at two Cross-examined Q Who is Mr Latchford A A bitmaker in St Martin s lane—I looked to the fund for the costs in this Chancery suit—there was a fund in the hands of the solicitor to the Treasury—I believe it was not in Court—there is an old suit of Wilding and Boulden—there was a portion of the estate of a man named Laurence who died intestate in America—the solicitor to the Crown had obtained administration and it is for the recovery of that and other property the suit is—they talked of a large sum—I believe there is about 7000l in the hands of Mr Maule—I was employed to take my share in the transaction by some old people named Wilkinson of whom the prisoner is either nephew or grandson—he brought me their retainers—that was very likely at my instance—he was a client of mine in the action but I did not consider him so in any other respect—I viewed him as the agent of the parties in the suit—he was so mixed up with the suit and the result of it that I considered him as one of my clients certainly Q How came you to be employed by Messrs Wright to go to France was it at their instance or at yours A That I can scarcely tell you—I never knew Messrs Wright prior to the transaction—I went to them—I should think I applied to them to act on their behalf when I got to France—I have no doubt of it—my object was not to take the man into custody it was to get some of the money back—I intended to have brought him back here—my object was to get the money and to take him into custody—the first time I saw him in France he was in custody—I told him my object was to put him into custody and then I asked him about the forged order—I said I wanted to know what he had done with the money obtained from Messrs Wright by forging Mr Pope s name and then he gave me the account I have stated—that remark was preceded by the statement that I intended to give him into custody—I did not put him into custody there—I was the medium by which he was put into custody—I had taken with me his acceptance in favour of Latchford and went to France to ascertain what could be done with him whether he could be sent to England or not—and under the advice of a French avocat I endorsed the bill to a Frenchman who took proceedings against him and had him arrested Q You put your name to it in order that the Frenchman to whom he owed nothing might arrest him A Yes to get back the money he owed Latchford—I did not go on with the suit after he left—I have a brother—I know there were dealings between him and the prisoner—I never knew the prisoner had made advances to him—I do not know that he owed him money—my brother went to India in May 1837 and is now a partner in one of the first houses of Calcutta—the prisoner went to France in March 1837—I am not acquainted with the friends and connexions of Mr Pope —I have no witness from Redditch to tell whose hand-writing the cheque is—I am not the attorney for this prosecution—Messrs Wright asked me to take it into my hands—they put it into the hands of Mr Humphries—I am not in any respect acting professionally in it—I did not expect the prisoner was in England when I saw him in Cateaton-street—I do not know how long he was in prison at the suit of the Frenchman but I think from information sent me from Paris that he was in prison two years—I think I never saw him write except in my office—that was not on the subject matter of the suit—I think it was on the subject matter of Mr Pope s money as it turns out MR BODKIN Q Have you any letters among your papers addressed by the prisoner to— A A great many REV ROBERT ALEXIUS POPE I am a Roman Catholic clergyman and live at Mount Carmel-house Redditch Worcestershire I have known the prisoner about four years and have corresponded with him perhaps between thirty and forty times—I am acquainted with his hand-writing—I was in the habit of sending him cheques on Wright s bank at times—they were dated London—they were on the top of a letter so as to have that part torn off—I filled up the cheques all but the banker s name—I think I have occasionally filled up the banker s name—I am not quite sure but in general I did not—they were remitted by the post—with the exception of one or two I filled up the cheques in the manner I have described—I omitted nothing but the banker s name—this cheque— looking at it —is not my hand-writing not a single word or letter of it—I never gave any body authority to draw that cheque—I believe it to be the prisoner s hand-writing and these two letters also—in March 1837 I had an account at Wright s—about that time I received a letter from Wright s containing this cheque—I have not got the letter—I fear it is destroyed—I immediately sent the cheque back to Wright s and stated my opinion of it—I made pecuniary advances to the prisoner on the affair of Wilkinson s law-suit—in January 1837 Mr Crosby paid me a visit—the prisoner was present at one interview and it was agreed that I should allow him no more money that I should send no more money up to him Cross-examined Q Did you know any of the Wilkinsons at all A I did—I was acquainted with them and knew there was a Chancery suit—I knew that before I knew Mr Crosby—I have never been in the habit of advancing money to persona to carry on suits—this was an act of kindness on my part—I never stipulated that there should be 10 000l coming to me Q On your oath was it not understood that you were to have 10 000l A It was understood but I did not ask it myself—I began to make advances without any promise—I advanced 495l altogether—I did not employ the attorney—I was warned against that—I advanced the money to the prisoner that he might do so—I cannot positively say that I have seen the prisoner write—I judge of his hand-writing from the letters which I have received from him nothing else—I am not quite sure whether the 10 000l was understood to be increased to 20 000l at any time—it might be—I never heard that so much as 48 000l was to be advanced—MR Crosby mentioned something about 7000l —I was never in the habit of sending the prisoner cheques in blank—I never left the amount blank—I told you I always wrote the cheques except the banker s name—the prisoner was acting as agent in the suit—I was advancing the money through him to Mr Crosby or any other solicitor he chose to carry on the suit—he had the power to choose the solicitor—I believe I never authorized him to use my name at all in the suit—I think I can swear it but I believe I did not—indeed I am almost sure I did not—I dare not go beyond that—I hare not heard from Mr Crosby what costs there are in the suit—I have paid no money to Mr Crosby as costs—I am not the prosecutor of this case I am only a witness—I did not authorize the apprehension—I was not aware of it till I was informed—I learnt it from Mr Crosby—I paid 20l as my share of the expense of sending Mr Crosby to France—I do not keep any cheque book and have no margins to which I can refer for the cheques I draw—I generally mark them down in my day-book—I have not got my day-book with me—my habit is to draw cheques on plain paper MR BODKIN Q Do you draw many cheques A I have drawn several—I do not know how many in a twelvemonth—I should not think I draw twenty in a year—I think I had advanced rather better than 100l when the suggestion was made to me about the 10 000l —the 10 000l was not for my own private advantage—it was to be applied in ecclesiastical matters—building a church or something—I was not to be personally benefited except having what I had advanced—I never gave the prisoner authority to put my name to cheques or to any instrument—these are letters which I have received from the prisoner— looking at some MR CLARKSON Q Have you neighbours acquaintances and friends who know you at Redditch and the neighbourhood A Yes BENJAMIN LATCHFORD I am a bit-maker and live in St Martin s-lane I have been acquainted with the prisoner about six years—I come from Birmingham which is fifteen or sixteen miles from Redditch—in 1836 Mr Crosby was my uncle s attorney—my uncle is still living—he is the proprietor of the establishment in St Martin s-lane—he was only acquainted with the prisoner by his calling at his house for me—the prisoner was introduced to Mr Crosby by me to carry on this inquiry—I have had dealings with him myself and seen him write—I should say this cheque is his hand-writing—I believe it to be his—I am not quite certain when he left this country—he was in my uncle s debt when he left between 83l and 84l Cross-examined Q What have you seen him write A Some letters of different descriptions on many occasions while he and I were acquainted between 1836 and his leaving London I cannot tell the time to a week—I do not keep any shop myself—I have no business of my own—I am servant to my uncle—I became acquainted with the prisoner on his coming to London in the suit I alluded to—he came and asked me if I knew one solicitor to be better than another to put it in his hands—I occasionally lent him a trifle of money sometimes 5l sometimes 10l and he paid me again—that was my dealings with him—I was told I was to benefit by the Chancery suit and he said he would make the arrangements for me—I do not recollect the amount of the share I was to have—I should think it was 400l or 500l JAMES HUTCHKINS I am a policeman I took the prisoner on the 14th of April—he rather hesitated at first to go saying I bad no right to take him unless I showed ray warrant—I told him it was not

defraud the Governor and Company of the Bank of England —2nd COUNT for uttering the same —Four other Counts varying the manner of laying the charge SIR FREDERICK POLLOCK and MR BULLOCK conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM DRINKWATER I am a clerk to the New Three-and-a-half per Cent Annuity-office in the Bank I produce the Bank ledger of the New Three-and-a-half—it is one of the public books of the Bank of England—it contains the names of the proprietors of the 3 1/2 per Cent New stock under the letter D—the particular entry did not happen to be made by me but by a clerk in the office Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q In whose custody is the book kept A In the custody of the office in a safe of which the Accountant General has the key—they are delivered out of a morning to the different clerks—I got it this morning from the safe in the office—about fifty clerks have the power of making entries in this book—the clerk is now in the office who made this entry MR BULLOCK Q What is the entry A Matthew Dick 1840 August 16th 2561 by D Gibson 4065 100l — looking at the power of attorney —I witnessed the acting upon this—it is a power of attorney for a transfer of stock and purports to be signed by William Pillgrem as being the attorney to transfer the 100l stock—there is on the back of this power a demand to act signed William Pillgrem —the entry is in the form in which it is always made—Gibson is the broker of whom Mr Dick bought the stock—the numbers refer to folios in the transfer-book by which means we trace the stock through different hands—the demand to act on the back of the power purports to be signed William Pillgrem —I witnessed that signature—there was a transfer made on that demand to act at the same time the 21st of September—here is the transfer book in which it is entered—I have attested this also—it purports to be made by William Pillgrem as attorney—this paper is an instruction for the power of attorney —previous to making a power of attorney instructions are delivered—they are instructions for the power which I have in my hand MR BALLANTINE Q Do you consider it necessary to have the party producing the power identified as the person in whose favour it is made A Certainly—that is usually done by the stock-broker who is ordinarily speaking a person we know JAMES RAILTON I am a stock-broker I carry on business at No 56 Thread needle-street I know the prisoner—I became acquainted with his person in July last—he came to my office—he was sent by Mr Dick and a friend of his—he came alone—he said he came from Mr Shed of Manchester-square a friend of Mr Dick—I have been acquainted with Mr Dick two or three years—the prisoner told me his name was William Pillgrem—I afterwards transacted some business for him as William Pillgrem—in September last he came again and produced this note purporting to be written by Mr Dick— read — Sir Will you be so kind as let me have 100l of my stock in the Long Annuities I do not know if the funds are shut but if they are will you let me have it at five per cent as I am in want of cash and about to depart for Scotland Will you send by bearer and oblige Mr Dick Wandsworth Sept 17th 1840 N B You shall have it as soon as I return and oblige M D Mr Railton Stock-broker I wrote a note to Mr Dick in answer to that and delivered it to the prisoner— R E Tomlins clerk to Messrs Freshfield Bank Solicitors proved the service of a notice on the prisoner personally to produce the note in question MATTHEW DICK In September last the prisoner did not bring me a letter purporting to come from Mr Railton JAMES RAILTON re-examined The substance of the letter was that it did not suit me to lend him 100l and if he wanted it he must sell the stock and get it in the regular way—on the following day the 18th September I received this letter from the prisoner— read — Sir I am sorry to trouble you so much but as I am so busily engaged and not a moment to spare I intrust the whole to Mr Pillgrem I do not think there would be any harm in him personating me but if there is I must sacrifice a little so if you can get the power to-day and send it by him I can sign it before I go as I do not start before this evening and oblige M DICK —the first note referred to 100l Long Annuities—that stock was closed at that time—when I received the note just read I set about preparing instructions for a power of attorney for the New 3 1/2 per Cent stock—the instructions produced are what I prepared—on sending in the instructions for the power of attorney I got from the Bank this blank instrument which I delivered to the prisoner—it was not then executed—I did not give him directions as to the execution of it—they are printed on it—I cannot say whether I called his attention to that—he came to me again on the following day the 19th—it then had the name of Matthew Dick opposite the seal and the names of two persons as witnesses—when the prisoner gave it to me as it now is I looked at it it appeared to me to be right—I told him I would leave it and if it was passed we would transfer the stock on the Monday—I took the power of attorney to the Bank and put it into the proper box—on the Monday morning I went to the Bank to inquire after it—it was not allowed at first—I produced those two notes as the hand-writing of Mr Dick and finally the power was allowed—I was there when the prisoner claimed to act on the power—I saw him put the name of William Pillgrem to the demand to act on that power—I effected the sale of the stock as soon as the power was passed on the Monday—I sold it to Mr Clement Smith—this is the transfer of that stock—I saw the prisoner sign the name of William Pillgrem to that transfer—I am the witness to his identity upon that—I received the money for the transfer of that stock 97l odd and deducting the commission and expense of the power I paid him over the net proceeds 96l 8s 6d Q During the whole of this time from July down to the transfer of the stock did you see Mr Dick at all A I am not sure but I rather think I did—I do not think he came to me about business—I think I did see him but not about business—in December Mr Dick called on me about business and some explanation then took place which led to this discovery—I went over to the Bank with him shortly alter—the prisoner afterwards came to me on the 10th of December to give me instructions for the sale of 10l Long Annuities in the name of Mr Dick and I gave him into the custody of Forrester the officer—I did not know where he lived at that time Cross-examined Q You had not known or heard of him before A No—I had seen him between July and September a few times—he came to me about Mr Dick s business three times—I am able to fix the number of times from business transactions—I had not seen him on other matters besides business transactions till he came to me with the note from Mr Dick—I was not in the habit of seeing Mr Dick between July and September—I saw him shortly after the first time I had seen the prisoner—I mentioned to him having seen Mr Pillgrem—I did not mention what he had stated to me—I was not very well acquainted with Mr Dick s affairs—I was not very well acquainted with him only slightly—I acted as broker to him in August—that was the only occasion on which I acted for him on my own account—I had acted for him on somebody else s account—that would put me in possession of his affairs as well as acting on my own account—I did it for my late employer Mr Parsons—MR Dick came to him and bought stock—previous to the prisoner s coming to me I pretty well knew what stock Mr Dick possessed—MR Dick lived at No 3 Trafalgar-square Charing-cross—I live at Islington—it was on the 14th or 18th of August that I acted on Mr Dick s business—I am not certain whether or not in the course of the business I had done for Mr Dick I had seen his hand-writing—I had not seen his hand-writing frequently—I will swear I had not seen it a dozen times—I may have seen it half a dozen times—I think I have seen his hand-writing but I cannot say how often—I am certain I have seen it half a dozen times at least—I have carried on business as a stock-broker on my own account since May last—I have been eighteen years with a broker who died in May—I am not a member of the Stock Exchange—I am not licensed at present—I was not licensed when this transaction took place—I am not aware that in acting without a license I was doing an illegal act—I was frequently on the Stock Exchange while with Mr Parsons—I do not know that it is customary to have a license—it is optional I believe that on my oath—all respectable stock-brokers do not act under a license SIR F POLLOCK Q Have you bought stock for Mr Dick A Yes I never sold any for him—a man s hand-writing does not at all times appear when he buys stock only if he accepts the stock in the Bank-book—it is usual to accept stock—it depends on the party—the hand-writing would appear then—it would be merely a signature—I never corresponded with Mr Dick so as to receive letters and notes from him—I was sufficiently acquainted with his hand-writing to say whether or not these notes were genuine—I thought they were genuine—I thought I knew enough of his hand-writing for that MATTHEW DICK re-examined I live at No 19 Catherine-street Pimlico—previous to the 21st of September last I had some money in the 3 1/2 per Cent Annuities—I never authorised the sale of it—I did not execute this power of attorney—I did not write this signature—I had no knowledge of any thing about the transaction—neither of these letters are my hand-writing—I did not authorise the writing of them—I know the prisoner—his name is Thomas Pillgrem—I know his hand-writing—the name Matthew Dick to the seal of this power I can swear is his writing and these two letters I believe to be his writing—I had no conversation with the prisoner about the power or these letters—I know nothing of the persons whose names appear as witnesses to this power—I never learnt from the prisoner who they were—he told me at the Mansion-house in the Magistrate s presence that he executed the whole himself—I asked him the question and he told me MR BALLANTINE Q Was that previous to the examination A Yes I asked how he could take on him to sign any tradesman s name and bring him into trouble and asked him how he transacted it—I threatened to punish him—I do not know whether that was before or after he told me—I did not say I would have him punished if he did not tell me nor if he told me I would not press hardly against him—nothing of the kind—two officers were in the room—whether they heard it I cannot say—I do not know whether they are here—I spoke as loud as I do now—I did not threaten him at all MR BULLOCK Q What did he say A He said he executed the power himself that he signed all the witnesses names and my name and nobody touched the power of attorney but himself from the time it came from the Bank till it was done MR BALLANTINE Q What are you A No profession at present—I told the prisoner I would be his friend if it was in my power but it was out of my power—it was all in the hands of the Bank of England—I said I could not be his friend—he is no relation of mine—he is a connexion—I did not at any period of the conversation say that I would be his friend—I did not use the word friend —I would have been his friend if it had been in my power but I did not tell him so—on my oath I did not use the term friend at all from the beginning to the end of the conversation—I did not make him any promise—I said nothing to induce him to make that communication—the conversation began by my asking how he could take it on him to bring me into such trouble—he said it was done and could not be undone that he could not help it and he said he was not the only one—I said it would have cost him his life a few years ago—he replied he could die but once—he is not related in any way to any portion of my family—I have known him from his infancy—I never employed him to act in matters of business of this kind—I never gave him authority to use my name—I did not tell the Magistrate of the conversation I had with the prisoner SIR F POLLOCK Q Do you know John Turner or Edward Thompson the attesting witnesses A No DANIEL FORRESTER I am a police-officer—I took the prisoner into custody—I have been to Wandsworth since to inquire after John Turner a vintner and Edward Thompson smith—I could not find any such persons Cross-examined Q Were you present at the conversation alluded to by Mr Dick A Some part of it—I must explain—the prisoner was very anxious to talk—I cautioned him against it and said Whatever you say I shall be very likely called on to give in evidence —he said I had no intention to defraud Mr Dick I intended to have paid him in five years again with interest —I do not think Mr Dick was present at that conversation—he said he was going to the Argus to insure his life—he pressed very much to see Mr Dick and Mr Dick came in and said My G— how could you do such a thing as this —the prisoner asked him to forgive him—he said I cannot it is out of my power—if you had told me in November how you were situated I might have assisted you MR BULLOCK Q Did he state what Mr Dick has said A Mr Dick was very much excited—he walked up to a desk and had some conversation with the prisoner which I did not pay attention to GEORGE PHILLIPS I am collector of rates at Wandsworth—there is no person named John Turner a vintner there nor Edward Thomas a smith The power of attorney being read purported to be attested by John Turner vintner and Edward Thomas smith Wandsworth GUILTY Aged 22 — Transported for Life There were other indictments

t18410201-688  688 WILLIAM SNELLING was indicted for feloniously forging on the 1st of January an order for the payment of 50l with intent to defraud Henry Bosanquet and others —2nd COUNT for uttering the same well knowing it to be forged MR BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution CHARLES SCHOFIXELD I am cashier at the branch of the London and Westminster Bank in High Holborn Mr Pinniger banks with us—on the 1st of January about ten minutes before five o clock the prisoner presented the 50l cheque now produced purporting to be signed by him—theprisoner had been in the habit of coming to the bank and I knew him before—I gave him a 20l note and thirty sovereigns—something about the cheque attracted my attention and I showed it to Mr Ewings the manager who requested the prisoner to write his name on the cheque—hewrote William Thompson—I did not know his name at that time—hedid not say what he was—he was taken into custody about a fortnight afterward Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Can you tell how he was dressed A Not exactly—he had a great-coat on—I cannot tell the colour—I showed the cheque to the manager as I noticed a difference in the signature but he thought it was genuine Q Did you not see the prisoner after that before he was apprehended A Yes I went to Mr Pinniger s office and saw him and he had an opportunity of seeing me there—he was apprehended next day or the day after—he could have absconded during that time—he was apprehended at his master s office—I only went there once before he was taken when I went I asked him if Mr Westmacot was at home— the firm is Pinniger and Westmacot —he answered me—I said nothing more to him—I said nothing about the cheque—I took the number of the 20l note MR BALLANTINE Q How long altogether was the person at your banking-house A He must have been there five minutes—I do not recollect having more conversation with him than asking how he would have the cheque cashed—the account with us is only Mr Pinniger s—thereis no regular time to make up his book—his book was sent in and then the prisoner was apprehended WILLIAM EWINGS I am manager of the Bloomsbury branch of the London and Westminster Joint-stock Bank Mr Henry Bosanquet is a shareholder and trustee—on the 1st of January Mr Schofield showed me a cheque—my attention was very particularly directed to the person who brought it—it was the prisoner Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Did you see him long A Several minutes—the gas was lighted—it was as near five o clock as possible—Ihad some conversation with him—I do not think there was any body else there to receive money—I may have mistaken one person for another in my time but have no recollection of it—I am certainly not mistaken on this occasion—my attention was particularly drawn to him by the cashier—he wore a hat and a brown great-coat JOHN PINNIGER I am a solicitor in Gray s-inn On the 1st of June the prisoner was a clerk in my employ—I have an account at the London and Westminster Bank—the cheque produced is not my hand-writing no part of it—I gave nobody authority to draw it—I have never seen the prisoner write although he is my clerk SAMUEL SHUTTLE WORTH I am principal clerk to Mr Pinniger and am acquainted with the prisoner s hand-writing—I believe the body of this cheque to be his hand-writing and this endorsement William Thompson I believe to be his also—I am perfectly well acquainted with his hand-writing—he was not at the office on the 1st of January at all—his salary was 15s a week Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q What do you say of the signature A If it was presented to me I should say it was not Mr Pinniger s—the letters P in are like his the rest is not so—I cannot say whether it is the same writing as the body of the cheque—it is an imitation—it is very dissimilar and there is certainly a difference in the colour of the ink—the indorsement is a similar hand-writing to the body—it is the same style of penmanship in my opinion—I do not think it dissimilar in any respect—itis the prisoner s ordinary hand-writing—there is no disguise about either the body or the endorsement Q Have you ever made a mistake about the prisoner s hand-writing A I may have done so in a short endorsement coming under my observation—Ido not remember any particular case but in the hurry of business I may have done so—I have no recollection of such a circumstance but will not swear I have not THOMAS FROOME I am a tailor and live in High Holborn On the 2nd of January the prisoner gave me an order for clothes—I saw him again about three or four days after I cannot say the date exactly—he gave me an order for clothes—he paid me 6l 1s in gold on the 2nd of January and 3l 10s the other day—I have since seen a great-coat which I sold him GEORGE WESTON police-constable F 6 On the 15th of January the prisoner was given into my charge—I showed him the cheque and told him what I took him for—he denied all knowledge of it and said it was not his hand-writing—I had received the cheque from Mr Ewings and have produced it to-day—I searched the prisoner s house and found some clothes which I produce MR EWINGS re-examined I have stopped the 20l note at the Bank but have not had any notice of it yet MR DOANE Q Had Mr Westmacot an account at your bank A He had MR DOANE called the following witnesses for the defence ANN CUSHION I am the prisoner s grandmother He lived with me at No 2 Charles-street Camber well New-road—I remember New Year s-day—on that day the prisoner staid at home all day—he never went out till after five o clock at night—we had tea at half-past four—I believe it was that time when we sat down to tea—he took tea with me and left about half-past five as near as I can guess—I have a clock at the foot of my stairs just before the door—I always keep it right within a minute or two as two young men go to work in the morning—I heard it strike five while getting our tea—Mary Wright Cushion my daughter-in-law has a room in my house and was at home all day—she came to our door while we were taking tea and saw me and the prisoner there—the prisoner had not a great coat at that time MR BALLANTINE Q How far is your house from Camberwell A About half a mile from the Green and between two and three miles from Holborn—I did not know the prisoner was charged with uttering a cheque till the officers came on Friday evening—he was then in custody—as far as I recollect it was the Friday fortnight after—I usually take tea about half-past four—we always wait for the milkman who never comes till after four—the prisoner does not usually come from the office till ten—I believe he was paid weekly but cannot say—I never heard what time he was charged with being at the banking-house till the officer come—he came on Friday and on Saturday—I knew of my son being examined but was not at the office nor did Mrs Wright go Q When did you first tell any body it was not till half-past five o clock that the prisoner left yon A I told the policemen when they came the first time that he did not leave till half-past five—I had not then heard the time he was charged with passing the cheque—I did not tell the officer he left the house at four or soon after—when he first came he asked what time my grandson left on New Year s-day—I said as near as I could recollect that it was half-past five—I said I persuaded him not to go out as it was after five but he did go—I did not tell the policeman it was four or a little after—I cannot say whether it had gone ten when the prisoner returned—he came home about ten—he did not say where he had been I did not ask him—I have not talked with Mrs Cushion about this particularly—we both knew the time he went out—the first conversation I had with her about it was when the policeman came on Friday—she came into the room while he was there—my son was examined at the office next day Saturday—the policeman had come between six and seven on Friday evening—he said the prisoner had been at the banking-house at I think three minutes to five—Mrs Cushion remained in the room the whole time the policeman was there—I was too full of trouble to say what conversation we had after he left—we might talk about what a pity it was he went out or so—we both knew he did not go out till after five and said he did not go out till after the time the policeman said he was at the Bank—she said Why mother I heard you talking to him after that time —I said Yes what a pity it was he went out at all —I wanted to persuade him not to go and he said I am not going far I shall not be long —they never told me there was any occasion to go to the office to state this—I did not know I might go and I did not think any thing about it—I did not know what to do—the policeman never told us to come—I was there the day he was sent from Tothill-fields on Saturday not when he was before the Magistrate—I did not know I could go or I would not have neglected any thing—but I did not know it would be of any service to him—I thought it my duty to come today Q Have not you seen the depositions against him A Yes I saw what the solicitor brought last Sunday to my house—he brought a statement of what the witnesses had said against the prisoner—the hour was mentioned in that statement—he showed it to us both—my daughter-in-law and I were together—I remembered the time he went out before that—thesolicitor did not ask what time he left that I know of—I told him myself before I saw the written statement I think—I only saw it in his hand—he did not read it to me nor did I read it—I cannot read correctly—heread the hour—I had not told him before that the time the prisoner left nor had my daughter-in-law MARY WRIGHT CUSHION I am the witness s daughter-in-law I live in the same house but in a different room up stairs—I saw the prisoner there on the afternoon of New Year s-day—I wanted the milk—I looked at the clock in my room and it was a quarter-past four o clock—I set the tea-things and then the milkman came—I did not look at the clock after that—it might be five minutes after I looked at the clock that the milkman came—I came down stairs and went to the front-door to take in the milk—mymother-in-law s room is the back-parlour—her door was open and I saw her and the prisoner—I stopped about a quarter of an hour talking to his grandmother at the door and then went up to my room—I did not see the prisoner after that—I left them there—my mother-in-law was setting the things putting the tea-board down and putting the tea-things on MR BALLANTINE Q Did you see any thing more of the prisoner that night A Not that night—that is the usual time they take tea—themilk sometimes comes at a quarter-past four o clock sometimes at half-past—Idid net know of this charge till the officer and banker s clerk came—I was not in the room when the officer came—he had been some time in the house before I saw or heard of him—this was on the Friday that the prisoner was taken—I heard a noise in the bed-room went down and came up again—I did not know what it was—I returned in three or four minutes heard my mother-in-law say Oh dear then went down to see what it was—I found the clerk and policeman in the prisoner s bed-room—Iremained there till they went away—immediately after they were gone my mother-in-law said Oh my poor boy he never can be guilty of this —she mentioned before the officer and clerk the time William went out on New Year s-day—she said it must be half-past five—I did not stop down stairs long after they left—I do not recollect that any thing was said about the time after that—there is a clock in the passage near Mrs Cushion s room and one in my room—mine was quite right I know as I hear St Paul s strike at night Q When did you first state to any body that it was a quarter-past four by your clock A I do not recollect saying it to any body but the gentleman who called last Sunday the prisoner s attorney—he had something written in his hand—I think he read it over to us—I now recollect that he did—it mentioned what was sworn against the prisoner—he directed my attention to the hour the cheque was presented at the Bank—this was in the presence of my mother-in-law—I then said it must be half-past four to the best of my opinion when I took in the milk I have no doubt of it—I did not look at the clock when I returned up stairs that I recollect—it was quite dark when I went up stairs—my clock generally agrees with Mrs Cushion s JURY Q Did you ever see the prisoner wear a great coat A I have seen him wearing a great coat—he had not his great coat on that day nor his boots or hat when I saw him—I do not know whether he bad a great coat on New Year s-day MR BALLANTINE called GEORGE WETON I am a policeman I went with Mr Schofield to take the prisoner into custody—I asked his grandmother at what hour he left on New Year s-day on the first day I went to search his box—she said he left between four and five o clock—I went again a day or two after for his clothes and asked her if he was ill on the 1st of January—I told her he had written to his master to say he was ill and could not come to his place—she said the prisoner bad told her he had leave from his master that day—I asked if she was positive of the time he left that day—she said to the best of her recollection it was a little after four MR DOANE Q She said to the best of her recollection A Yes Schofield was not with me the second time JURY to MRS CUSHION Q Had he a great-coat on New Year s-day when he went out A No he had none in his possession at that time GUILTY Aged 17 — Transported for Ten Years Before Mr Justice Coltman

others —Other COUNTS varying the manner of laying the charge CHARLES CHAPPELL I live at No 7 Leicester-square It is a house kept for the purpose of play—I am waiter and also an assistant in the house—I know the prisoner—I have seen him at the house on two or three occasions—he played on two occasions—I first saw him there eight or nine days before the 29th of December—I saw him on Monday night the 28th about half-past twelve o clock—I was in the billiard-room when he came—he asked me if there was any play—I said uo—he asked me to go up and play with him—I did so—there was nobody else there—before we began to play he asked what bank there was and I showed him 130l in Bank of England notes in the cash-box—that was all the money that was in the bank—we began playing at hazard—he lost 70l which he paid in 5l and 10l country bank-notes—he went away and returned in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour and proposed to play again—we played at hazard—he lost 75l which he paid in country bank-notes 5l 10l and among them was one of 20l —Air Thompson who is the proprietor of the house came into the room while we were playing and assisted at the table in gathering the counters—he came in during the time he was playing on the first occasion and was present on the second occasion but went away after the prisoner left a second time—he was there all the time of the second play—after the second play the prisoner asked if he went and got some more money whether we would play with him again—I said it was late it was past our hour which is twelve—it was then five or six o clock in the morning—he went away returned in about twenty minutes and I played with him again at hazard—he lost 380l on the third occasion—he paid it in a bank post bill of 300l and another for 80l —he then went away and did not return again—he lost altogether 525l —I put the notes he had given me into the cash-box with the Bank of England notes—there were no country bank notes there before—Mr Thompson was gone when the prisoner came back the third time and the house was shut up—I was going to bed and was partly undressed—I told him it was past hours and we could not play but he said he would have satisfaction he had lost a good deal of money and I had a right to give him a chance to get it back again and he produced a pocket-book and said There is money in that so we played—I put the whole of the money into the bank—it is a mahogany box—I took it from the box about nine o clock in the morning when he left put it into my pocket went to Mr Thompson and gave it to him—I counted it before I gave it to him—it was 525l and 130l in Bank notes besides—I afterwards accompanied Mr Thompson into the City to get the notes cashed—Mr Thompson gave me two 5l and one 10l notes to take to Masterman s—I believe those now produced to be the same—I presented them and they were not paid—I waited there about five minutes—I had two other notes on Glynn s in my pocket one for 5l and one for 10l —I gave them to a gentleman at Masterman s—these notes look like them—I gave them all up to the same person Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Do the police know of this bouse of yours A I do not know—I am not aware that they know what purpose it is used for—the prisoner only played on two nights—the first time he won and went away with the money—he had been in our house I think on three separate nights—he went away and returned three times on the last occasion—he lost every time—hazard is a game of chance merely Q Did not it strike you as odd be should always lose you must have been in great luck A That might be the case—there is no management in the play—I never heard of such a thing as to cog a die —no doubt there is such a thing as loading a die—we sometimes played for 5l at a time and sometimes 10l —we were about it from half-past twelve o clock at night till about nine the next morning—no one came into the room while we were playing except the waiter to stir up the fire but he did not come near the cash-box—I gave the notes up to Mr Thompson about a quarter to ten o clock—I started from his house to go to the Bank about eleven—there was a Bank post-bill for 300l and one for 80l which was not due and 50l of the notes were not payable in London which Bults in Cheapside cashed for 6d in the pound—I got nothing for my share it will be his altogether—what I get rests entirely with my employer—I dare say I shall get something—I have a regular salary—it was my master s money I was playing with—our house has never been indicted to my knowledge not since Mr Thompson hag had it—we are particular who we admit to play—we only judge by their appearance if they look like gentlemen—I dare say all the blacklegs in London are well dressed—nobody is concerned with Mr Thompson there—I do not know that many blacklegs play there that I swear nor do I believe it JOHN THOMPSON On Monday night the 28th I was at the rooms No 7 Leicester-square and saw the prisoner and Chappell playing at hazard—they played after I went in for about three-quarters of an hour—the prisoner lost and I saw him pay country notes—he went out returned in a short time with a fresh supply of notes and played again—I played—he lost about 75l the second time—he paid that in the same desecription of notes and as he went away I heard him say something about having an 80l bank post-bill and he should not be above a quarter of an hour and would go and fetch it—I did not wait as it was very late—it must have been some time after four—there bad been 130l in the bank the night before in Bank of

taken into custody by Forrester afterwards just outside Barclay s door where I was waiting for Chappell—I changed one 10l note at Payne Smith and Payne s—the Manchester bank post-bills I had still in my pocket and gave them to Forrester with the remainder of the notes Cross-examined Q Was any body else playing that night A Not any one that I saw—it was after twelve o clock when I went into the room—whatever is won is put into the box to the best of my knowledge—I have trusted Chappell with a deal of money—the box is not very often very full we change about—I should not think it was a losing concern—I know it is against the law to do this but I do it—I never kept a gambling-house before—I decline saying whether I have ever been in gaol—or whether I have been tried in a court of justice—I have been tried once—I do not know that I am obliged to answer where I went to after the trial—I did not go home—I went where they took me—I saw my home again as soon as I could as soon as they gave me my liberty—I decline saying how long it was before they gave me my liberty—I was never in prison for any thing but keeping a gambling-house—the term bonnet means parties I believe playing at the table and belonging to the house—I do not know that they are always partners—we have nothing of the kind at our house WILLIAM SIMPSON I am principal cashier at Masterman s the bankers On the 29th of December Chappell brought two 5l notes of the Boston bank and one of the Commercial Bank of England—that bank had no account with us at that time—the Boston bank still kept an account there—I gave the notes I received from him to Mr Peel a clerk in the country office—our firm is William Masterman and others JOSEPH PEEL I am principal clerk in the house of Masterman and Co I received three notes

am clerk to Messrs Bush and Masters solicitors I received these three notes from Mr Mildred and have produced them here JOSEPH CLATPON ESQ I am a partner in the house of Garfit Clay-pon and Co of Boston The notes issued by our bank are always signed by one of the partners—these two notes are not genuine—there is nobody of our bank of the name signed to them—I do not know the names at all—they are 5l and 10l notes—there are no such persons as Harris and Summers which names are to them—it is not the signature of any body connected with our firm—the notes seem to be taken from the plate used for our notes EDWARD CLARK I am in the service of Messrs Bult bullion-dealers in Cheapside I remember the witness Thompson coming there on the morning of the 29th of December to exchange Scotch Irish and local notes—we cashed them at a small discount DANIEL FORRESTER I am an officer of the Mansion-house I took Thompson into custody on the 29th of December in Barclay s banking-house—I had seen him in Lombard-street—I went into the house with him—I do not know what was said to him at first—I was rather behind—Chappell either pointed him out or accosted him—Thompson pointed out Mr Mitchell as the person he had changed a 10l note with and I took Thompson into custody—Chappell was before me—Thompson immediately said I have other notes and received them in play —he gave me an account of them—he gave up and I took from him a great many notes which I produce—he gave me some Bank of England ones—I produce the country notes he gave me JOHN MITCHELL I am cashier at Barclay and Co s On Tuesday the

ran over to the bank to stop the payment of the note I had given for it—shortly afterwards Forrester brought him to oui house—the note produced is it—I put a mark on it at the time—the signature is forged GEORGE BUGG I am manager of the Spalding branch of the Stamford and Spalding Banking Company This is not a genuine note—it appears to have been taken from our plate—the signatures are both fictitious—we have no persons of the names signed to it THOMAS COOK I keep a billiard-room in the Strand The prisoner came to my house on the evening of the 31st of December—I received a letter in the morning by post purporting to come from him—this is it—I received this other letter by the hands of my brother afterwards JOHN COOK I gave that letter to my brother—I received it from Manning JOHN MANNING I am porter at Fricour s hotel St Martin s-lane I saw the prisoner there about seven o clock in the evening of the 1st of January—he gave me a letter to take to T Cook Esq Strand and told me if I was asked where I came from not to tell them—I took that letter and gave it to John Cook—Mr Cook went back with me and got Forrester—I pointed the prisoner out to Forrester at Fricour s hotel DANIEL FORRESTER re-examined I took the prisoner into custody—I searched him in a private room in the hotel and found a letter containing three bills a note and some money in a pocket-book—he asked who I was—I told him I was an officer and took him into custody for passing forged notes—he said they were not forged but fictitious—I put him into a coach and Chappell and I and him went towards Giltspur-street Compter—Chappell had gone with me to identify him and he said in the coffee-room I give that person into custody for forgery —in the coach the prisoner said I have lost a great deal of money in gambling I have been ruined and I have taken those steps to try to get it back —Chappell said We have not bad any of your money you are a winner of us 5l —the prisoner said 4l 10s JOHN MEESOM I am clerk at Glynn s These two notes purport to be payable at our house from the bank of Manchester—they have removed their account from our house some years but from what I recollect of their notes I should say these are not genuine WILLIAM NICHOLLS I am clerk to Messrs Dennison bankers in Lombard-street who are the correspondents of the bank of Manchester This 10l and this 5l note are both forged EDMUND BURDICAN I am manager of the bank of Manchester These post-bills for 300l and 80l are forged—the plate is genuine but they are not our filling up—the signatures are not genuine—we have no parties of that name nor is it the handwriting of any body belonging to our establishment—we get our plates from Perkins and Bacon The two letters produced in the former case were again read also another found on the prisoner addressed to Mr Johnson instead of Thompson dated the 1st of January from Wright s hotel stating that the bearer would give him his acceptance at fifty one days three months and six months for 525l on his returning notes to that amount that if it was in his power to make the party who had given him the notes pay him before the bills were due he would pay them

uttering the same knowing it to be forged —Other COUNTS varying the manner of laying the charge MESSES CLARKSON and DOANE conducted the Prosecution JOHN WESLEY BARNET I am a clerk in the service of Edwin Leaf who has partners—they are wholesale haberdashers and warehousemen The prisoner is a draper living at Halifax and has dealings with our house—he was indebted to us in September last—I produce a bill of exchange which I got from him on the 7th of September—ho owed the firm between 300l and 400l at the time—one of our own bills on him had been due on the 4th and was dishonoured and returned on the 5th and on the 7th he came and said he could not pay any money on account of that draft—he produced this bill and said he could pay us that bill on account of the dishonoured draft—I took it up in my hand looked at it and said Mr Latham this is rather a large bill for a retail draper who is Mr Pearson who it was drawn on —he said Mr Pearson is a regular customer of mine —I said Does he owe you any thing besides this —he said Yes —I said How much —he said Between 100l and 200l besides —I said Why Mr Latham this is a very large amount for you to trust a small tradesman in Sutton as I supposed it to be—he said he bad traded with the man a long time he had been regular in all his transactions with him and it would be paid he was certain be bad no doubt about the account himself—I then took the bill relying on it being duly paid when it became due—it was not paid—to the best of my belief the handwriting on the bill is the prisoner s—I am well acquainted with his handwriting—I have seen it repeatedly—I do not know that I have seen him write—I have repeatedly received letters from him and acted on them—I have not the slightest doubt of its being his all but the acceptance Thomas Pearson —that is quite a different character to the rest—I think the acceptance is his with the exception of the signature—the bill was brought to me ready indorsed THOMAS PEARSON I follow the farming business and live at Sutton near Doncaster The prisoner is my cousin—this acceptance is not mine—I never authorised the prisoner or any body else to accept this bill for me—I never did accept indorse or draw a bill to my knowledge nor authorise any body to do so—I was not indebted at the time the bill is dated to the prisoner 300l or 400l nor 3d —I never had dealings with him to the amount of this bill nor a larger amount—I was not aware there was such an acceptance in existence till I was called upon to pay it Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You never owed the prisoner any money A Yes I owed him a trifle of money for things from the shop sending for them—I never owed him any great amount at a time—I never owed him 50l —I never accepted a bill in my life to my knowledge—I will swear I never did to my knowledge accept a bill for any person—I do not think I could have done it and forgot it—I know the prisoner s brother Thomas—he lives at Fenwick—I never accepted a bill for him for any amount I swear that positively—I never accepted a bill at Thomas s house for any body—I have known the prisoner draw bills in my name in four or five instances—I could not speak to the time—it is two or three years ago I believe—I was applied to by Mr Lawrence of Manchester as the acceptor of a bill—I was applied to for the payment of dishonoured bills both in Manchester and London—I was applied to by firms but whether in London or Manchester I did not know—I was applied to by Mr Duncan of Halifax—that was so lately I did not forget it—I was applied to by Leaf Cole and Co but not by Mr Field of Finchley to my knowledge so lately as September 1839 and I should say not at any time—I will swear I had application from firms which I made no minute of—I do not recollect the name of Robert Clark and Son but I was applied to by two or three firms before I put it down—I will not swear I was not applied to by them but I do not recollect it MR CLARKSON Q As soon as you had two or three applications you applied to your attorney about it A Yes Mr Coward—I replied to the persons who applied for payment of the acceptance that it was not by my consent or knowledge nor my handwriting—I replied to all the parties that they were forgeries and wrote to the prisoner to reprimand him for his conduct—there had been several of these forgeries—I never paid any of them nor do I know who did—they may all be paid for any thing I know—I was about to prosecute my cousin—I put it into the hands of my attorney to do so and he took what steps he thought proper—Leaf Coles and Co are a different firm to Leaf Smith and Co —on my oath not one of the acceptances I was applied to about were accepted by me or by my authority CHARLES LEACH COWARD In the latter end of December 1889 or the beginning of January 1840 Mr Pearson applied to me—he brought me a letter he had received in consequence of which I went over to Halifax and found the prisoner there—I told him I had come over to see him COURT This does not apply to this bill The bill being read was drawn by the prisoner on Thomas Pearson of Button payable at Joseph Dennison s Esq Banker London George

his intent to be to defraud Charles Button Dixon SIR FREDERICK POLLOCK MR ADOLPHUS and MR BULLOCK conducted the Prosecution HENRY HEDGES I am a boot and shoemaker and live in Wells-row Islington About eleven o clock on the evening of the 20th of February I was in my shop—a person very much resembling the prisoner came in—I believe him to be the same—he asked for a pair of Wellington boots and agreed to give 20s for a pair and offered me a 5l note—the one now produced is the note for I wrote on it the name and address he gave me Davis 22 Holloway-place —I wrote that from his mouth as the direction he gave and added my initials H H to it at the same time—I went out to a neighbour to get change and in consequence of what the neighbour said I returned to my shop and told the prisoner I could not get change for the note—I did not say why and asked if he had a sovereign in his pocket—he said he had not but he had 15s which he gave me—I told him he had better give me the 15s and pay the remainder when the boots were sent home—he agreed to that and did so—I returned him his note and he left the shop—I went with the boots to the direction he gave—the people I suppose were all gone to bed—I rang three or four times but nobody answered—I did not see him again Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Who else was in your shop A My wife—nobody else—I suspected the note was forged when I returned it to him but gave him no intimation of it—it was about eleven o clock at night—I never saw a Bank of England note like this—it would not impose on me MR ADOLPHUS Q Perhaps tradesmen are in a hurry on Saturday night and fatigued A Yes—I told the prisoner I would go and get change but it was not my intention to do so ELIZABETH HEDGES I am the wile of the last witness I should not like to swear to the prisoner but I am pretty sure he is the same person who came on Saturday night the 20th of February—he was rather fatter in the face I think then than now—I saw him again next morning Sunday—he came to the private door and knocked—I went to the door—my husband was in bed—it was rather before nine o clock—he said Your husband has not sent my boots —I said My husband took them last night to No 22 Holloway-place —he said that was not the place it was No 22 some other place very much like the same sound which he named but I cannot say what it was—I asked him twice over but then I could not understand what place it was—I went in got the boots brought them to him in the private passage and gave them to him—he said he did not much like carrying them along on the Sunday—I asked him if we should send them—he said No thank you I am going home this morning I will take them —he gave me two half-crowns put the boots in his handkerchief and took them away CHARLES SUTTON DIXON I am a boot and shoemaker in Lowndes-place Hoiloway-road On the 20th of February about half-past eleven o clock at night the prisoner came to my shop and asked for a pair of Wellington-boots—I said I don t keep Wellingtons but I keep Clarence which I showed him—he tried them on fixed on a pair at 10s 6d and tendered me this piece of paper in payment—I know it by the writing at the back J Monteith 7 Brunswick-grove which he wrote on it in consequence of my asking for his name and direction—it had Davis 22 Holloway-place H H on it at that time—I took the note up stairs got change out of my cash-box and gave him 4l 9s 6d —he went away and took the boot and money—he returned in about seven or ten minutes for his umbrella—I was rather busy that night—I did not look much at the note as I had two persons in the shop waiting for goods—on Tuesday morning I went to No 7 Brunswick-grove but could not find any such person there—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody and recognised him as the person who gave me the note Cross-examined Q You have been in the habit of seeing Bank of England notes A I have in the course of my life but not many in my business—if I had had time to look at it I should not have taken it for a genuine note but I was hurried and did not look at it particularly—it is not like any bank-note I ever saw SIR FREDERICK POLLOCK Q What do mean by not being like A It is not like a 5l note when I come to look at it—I took it for one and gave change—when I came to look at it I saw at once it was not genuine SCIPIO FINCH police-constable B 90 On the evening of the 20th of March I went to Mr Trott s house at Nunhead and found the prisoner there—I took him into custody and told him I took him for passing to Mr Trott a bad 5l note—I took him to the station and found these two 5l notes on him—here are the marks I made up them—I found them between his thigh and his trowsers—he had previously told me he had no more notes only the one he gave Mr Trott—he had put his hand down to his boot and said it hurt him JOSHUA FREEMAN I am inspector of notes to the Bank of England This paper is a gross imitation of a Bank of England note—it is forged in every respect paper watermark signature and all—these other two are I also forged in all respects—it has all the words and form of a banknote—the numbers and the name of the cashier is omitted—all the three have the same signature Cross-examined Q There is paper and ink in it as there is in a bank-note A Yes and writing and a little printing—I should certainly not take it for a note it is a very bad imitation—the ink has gone through the paper—the paper is not a bit like that which we have for bank-notes—this is not like a banknote—part of it appears to be written SIR FREDERICK POLLOCK Q Has it the form of a note A Yes it has the imitation of what is found usually on a 5l Bank of England note and it has a very fair imitation of one of our cashier s writing Zachariah twins—I do not see any part omitted that is to be found in a bank-note—I have no doubt of its being an imitation of a bank-note GUILTY — Transported for Life There were two other indictments against the prisoner

William Tucker MR RYLAND conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM TUCKER I am a poulterer in the Strand—I also deal in Welsh mutton On Saturday afternoon the 20th of March between three and five o clock the prisoner came to my shop and asked for some Welsh mutton for Mr Tucker of Long-acre who is a customer of mine—my man weighed the mutton and I made out the bill—it was 20s or 22s —the prisoner tendered this cheque on the back of which was written Richard Tucker Long-acre —I took it and gave the prisoner the change—I put the cheque into the till with my other money and paid it in to Messrs Twinings my bankers on the Monday—it was returned in due course saying No account —I then went to Mr Tucker s Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How do yon know the prisoner A From looking at him particularly—I believe him to be the man—I am not aware that there is a person about town very like him—he handed me the cheque—I did not know him before—it is a face I have seen some-where—I cannot say where—I do not think he had gloves on—coming as a butcher I think I should have noticed if he had—there was nothing particular about his hands which struck me— the prisoner here exhibited his hands on each of which the two middle fingers were joined together as one —they are certainly very remarkable hands—I put the change on the counter and saw him take it up but did not observe that peculiarity MR RYLAND Q Can you positively say he had no gloves on A No but he might have given me the cheque with his finger and thumb without my noticing that deformity RICHARD TUCKER I am a butcher in Long-acre I know the prisoner and have had dealings with him at times—the name Richard Tucker on this cheque was not written by me nor by my authority—I did not send the prisoner to the prosecutor s on the 20th of March for any mutton—I never saw him write Cross-examined Q Have you known the prisoner long A Two or three years—he used to sell Welsh mutton in Newgate-market JURY Q Were you aware of the deformity in his hands A No I never noticed it—I have had twenty or thirty transactions with him JAMES ASHTON I am a clerk in the London and Westminster Bank Lothbury This is one of their forms of cheque—no

passage leading to New-gate-market—I said Greeley I want to speak to you —he came on one side—I told him he was charged by Mr Tucker of the Strand with passing a cheque for 5l and that it was forged—he then said My name is not Greeley it is Johnson —I took him to the station searched him and found on him a 10l cheque on the same bank and a flash—note for 50l —the inspector desired me to take him to the Compter—as we were going there he said It is all over I did it but I did not fill up the cheque myself —I desired him not to say any thing to me unless he liked and he did not say any thing more Cross-examined Q You are quite accurate as to the words he used A Yes—I am sure he said It is all over and I did not fill up the cheque myself—those were the words—the cheque and note is all I found on him—I found 1d and a knife and a surer pencil-case—I think they are at the station—I also found on him a duplicate for a ring and a duplicate for a pair of trowsers—I forgot that at the moment MR RYLAND Q Have the note and cheque ever been out of your possession A No MR PHILLIPS called JOHN RONDO I am in the employ of Mr Drew a poulterer in Fins—bury-pavement About a week before I went to Guildhall a young man came to my master s and presented a forged cheque—I saw the person when he presented it—my master went to Guildhall about it—I was afterwards sent for by Mr Alderman Hnmphery and saw the prisoner there—he is not the person who presented the cheque—he is not like the person in features—he is about the same height and age—I had a greater opportunity of seeing the person than my master—after my master had sworn to him he was not exactly positive and sent for me on that account—he thought the prisoner was the man but was not positive MR RYLAND Q You had no difficulty in distinguishing between the prisoner and the man A No JOHN DEAR re-examined Looking at his deposition This is my handwriting—it was read over to me before I swore to it—I was desired to attend to it and paid attention when it was read—it was written by Mr Newman a clerk in the office at Guildhall— the witness s deposition being read omitted the words He said it is all over but stated

stating his intent to defraud Richard Henry Cox and others —3rd and 4th COUNTS calling it a warrant for the payment of money MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution DANIEL HOWARD I am clerk to Richard Henry Cox and others of Craig s-court Charing-cross he is the senior partner On the 13th of May I was in attendance at the banking-house—the prisoner came there about a quarter to three o clock in the afternoon and presented this cheque—on looking at it I discovered the signature was forged—I asked him who Robert Perks the person in whose favour it is drawn was—he said he brought it from the under butler at the same time handing me this card—he said the person had asked him to get cash for the draft and to make haste as the gentleman was going out of town in the morning that he received 1s and drank a pint of beer with the man and was to receive 1s on his return—I asked him if he knew the butler—he said he did not know much of him he had seen him before—he said the under butler had sent him to receive the cheque—suspecting it to be forged I consulted with the firm as to what steps to take and a policeman was called in—Mr Lawrence Palk had an account at our house at that time Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Would you under any cir-cumstances pay a cheque in this form without a date to it A It is a question—it requires a date—if Mr Palk had brought it himself we should have given him the money—the date is a matter which rests with the cashier—I keep Mr Palk s account and no cheque is paid without my approval as to the signature and as to the amount whether the balance will bear it Q Should you consider a document drawn in that way sufficient authority to pay money to another person Q That rests with the cashier—I am not in the habit of paying cheques—the prisoner said he got the cheque from a person who called himself Mr Palk s under butler COURT Q Did he say who called himself so A I asked him who Robert Perks was and he said The under-butler handing me the card MR BALLANTINE Q Did he not say it was a person who told him he was Mr Palk s under butler A Yes—while I was consulting some of the firm the prisoner was in my room up stairs—I did not place him in any Confinement at that time nor direct he should be watched—when I came back and charged him with the cheque being forged he said he would clear his character if some one would go back with him—he said he could take a person to the party who gave him the cheque—I sent for a police man and gave him into custody—I think I heard him say the same thing to the policeman—the policeman took him to the station MR DOAN Q It is not part of your duty to pay cheques A No—if I was satisfied it was Mr Palk s handwriting I should have put my initials to it and sent it to the cashier—I should not have hesitated a mo-ment in doing so if I had considered it his signature—the prisoner said he had seen the butler before MR BALLANTINE Q From your knowledge of the mode in which business is transacted in your firm would the cashier have paid the cheque without your initials to it A Certainly not MR BODKIN Q He would have paid no cheques without initials A In some instances but it is not done in Mr Palk s case LAWRENCE PALK ESQ I lodge in Mount-street Berkeley-square—I know nothing of this cheque—it is not mine nor was it written by my authority—I keep cash at

to be at the bank before three o clock—I searched him and found inside the lining of his waistcoat pocket these three thimbles also 1s 11d in money four duplicates and this piece of blank paper—I did not find any pea—he gave me his name as John Smith Bowling-green-lane Marylebone—he did not know the number—he said it was at an eating-house and next door or next door but one to the police-station

to take it away from me—I prevented him—another constable came in—I assisted in taking them to the station—I afterwards went to the Bank of England with Mr Adams—I had the note with me and took it to the Bank—it is the same note I had from Mr Belcher—it never went out of my sight from the time I received it till I gave it to Mr Adams at the Bank—he gave it to the cashier in my presence Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Was there any struggle between you and Barber for the note A He caught hold of the note and I tried to keep it—the struggle was very little but if I had not held it very fast I have no doubt he would have taken it—I do not know whether it lasted half a minute—he caught hold of my hand I closed it and kept the note secure—he was within my reach—I was unfolding the note to look at it at the time I saw him advancing to take the note from my hand—he put out his hand took hold of mine and tried to open it to take the note THOMAS LEACH police-constable D 169 On

were brought to the station-house in Marylebone-lane charged with attempting to utter a 10l note—Matthews said his name was John Matthews No 76 Strand and that he was a gentleman—Barber gave his name

of against them—Matthews said I took the note of a friend of mine about a fortnight ago —he mentioned his friend s name but I cannot recollect it—he said he could produce his friend at another time to show that he had received it from him—Barber said I know nothing about it —the note was given into my hands and I gave it back to the constable again—it was not out of my sight from the time I received it till I gave it back to the constable—I have inquired about the Strand and Trafalgar-street as to the residence of these persons and have not discovered anything about them—I found six No 2 s in Trafalgar-street—I inquired at all JOSHUA FREEMAN I am inspector of notes to the Bank of England—this is a forged note—it is not bank paper—it is not an impression from a bank plate nor the signature of Mr Parquot our cashier which it purports to be—it is forged in every particular Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Has it not happened at the Bank within your own knowledge that a note was pronounced forged which turned out to be genuine A I once did see a good note marked forged so many years since—I cannot say whether that was done by an experienced officer—no inspector could make a mistake if a note was properly put into his hands MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Q How many yean is that ago A I should say nearly twenty—I have been in the service of the Bank thirty years—it was the only good note I ever saw marked in that manner—I have seen a great many millions of good notes in my time it is impossible to say how many and a great many bad ones ANN RICHARDSON I am single and live at No 8 Edgeware-road—I keep a hosier s shop On the 11th of December just before one o clock the two prisoners came to my shop—Matthews asked to look it some handkerchiefs which I showed him—he selected four

prisoners were still there—Matthews had taken the change up—Minton brought the note back said he did not like the appearance of it and wished the change returned—Matthews returned him the change which

not return Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you swear positively to both the prisoners A No—I am uncertain about Barber COURT Q Are you positive of Matthews A Yes and believe Barber to be the other—I saw him again in custody on the Tuesday or Thursday after SAMUEL EDWARDS I am in the service of Miss Richardson On Saturday the 11th of December both the prisoners came to the shop before my mistress saw them—I know them both again—Matthews asked to look at some handkerchiefs—I called mistress down—Matthews asked me if there was a master—I said No —my mistress came and showed them the handkerchiefs—Matthews asked her to give him change for a 10l note—she said she had not got it in the house—they said they would call for them as they came back—Barber said it would be out of their

not—Matthews took up the 10l note gave back the change said they would call for the goods as they came back and went oat—he never called again Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q When Minton said he should like to have his change did not Matthews say he might have it if he liked A Yes EDWARD MINTON I keep the Mitre at the corner of Connaught-street On the 11th of December Edwards came for change for a 10l note—I gate him two 5l notes—I left the 10l note on the counter and on looking at it more particularly directly the boy was gone I thought it was a bad one—I noticed the badness of the paper and the signature Parquot—I noticed the name of Bradworth or something like it on the back— looking at the one uttered to Mrs Harding —this has the name it had on it and this is the very same note—I went back to the shop with it where Edwards lives and saw two men the one tall and the other short—I cannot swear to the prisoners the time being so short—I said I thought the note was bad—the short one said Why do you think so —I said there was no water mark and I would rather have my change—he held it up to the light and asked if I could not see the water mark—I said no certainly—he said Take your change again that will settle the business which I did and gave him the note—he said he must leave the things and call in the afternoon for them ISAAC HENRY ROBERT MOTT I have ware-rooms at No 76

shopman was showing him a card of goldeepers—Matthews said to me I don t much like it but what is the price —the shopman said he had offered 7s for the ring—he said I will take them and said It is my first undertaking of matrimony —I said I wish you much joy —he pulled a 5l Bank-note out of his pocket—I took it from his hand looked at it and saw a name endorsed at the back of it—I think it was

dress of not less than seven breadths prepared and forwarded to the Royal York Hotel Southampton addressed to Mrs Colonel Hill Royal York Hotel Southampton by the Southampton Railway—I sent it on Tuesday evening the 16th of November—on the 13th I had also received this other letter No 3 —this is the velvet dress— looking at it —which I forwarded to Southampton—I afterwards received this other letter No 4 purporting to come from Mrs Colonel Hill acknowledging the receipt of the dress and saying it was approved of and containing another order for a dress and a cloak which I did not execute—I entertained some suspicion and my brother went to Southampton—there was a bill of parcels forwarded with the velvet dress—the price of it was fifteen guineas—the box produced is the one in which the dress was sent—the direction was on a card which has been torn off but here are the words To be kept dry written on the box in our writing Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Had you known a lady of the name

the 6th of November No 1 purport to come from Mrs Colonel Hills A No there is no s at the end it is Hill—I should not take the stroke at the end of the word to be an s —the word Colonel is finished in the same way—there is an unaccountable stroke at the end—it could not be made into an s —I addressed my letter to Mrs Colonel Hill Newport Isle of Wight—this first letter came in an envelope which was

account and a remittance will be forwarded To Miss Clapham WILLIAM BETTLE In November last I was one of the waiters at the Royal York Hotel Southampton On the 17th of November the box produced arrived there by the railway—it was addressed to Colonel or Mrs Colonel Hill at the Royal York Hotel—I delivered it to the prisoner on the same day it arrived—he had been there before and asked for letters addressed to Colonel Hill or Mrs Colonel Hill and had received two letters—when he came for this box he came to the bar-door and said Is there anything addressed for me or Mrs Colonel Hill —I said Who are you —he said I am Colonel Hill —I said There is a box —I delive ed it to him and he took it away Cross-examined Q Do you mean to swear that when he came for the box he said I am Colonel Hill A Yes he came to the bar-door and said Is there any thing directed for me or Mrs Colonel Hill —I said Are you Colonel Hill —he said Yes and I said There is a box —I had given him two letters I think about the 11th or 12th Q How came you to ask him if he was Colonel Hill when he came for the box when you had given him these two letters A These few days intervening perhaps I might not know the person again being in a hurry and carriages at the door—I am sure he is the man that came for the two letters—I asked him because I thought I might have been deceived but he is the person—when he came for the letters he asked if there was any letters for Colonel or Mrs Colonel Hill—I said There are two letters and gave them to him—I believe that was all that passed then—the barmaid might have been at the bar at that time—the box was brought to the bar-door from the railway-station—I was there and paid 1s 3d for it MARGARET HILL I am the widow of Colonel Hill In November last I was residing at Newport in the Isle of Wight—I had no acquaintance there of the name of Carnagee—I know no one of that name—I know nothing of the prisoner—these letters are none of them written by me or by my authority—I am popularly known as Mrs Colonel Hill my letters are so directed Cross-examined Q Is your name Hill or Hills A Hill—I have resided in Newport nearly two years—my husband was a Lieutenant-Colonel—I do not know a Mrs Carnagee nor any similar name—I do not know that I ever heard there was such a person—I have resided off and on at the Isle of Wight for a number of years—there

never wrote a letter for me but once and that was to the Rev Dr Jamieson—I saw him write that and I read it afterwards MR CLARKSON Q Do you believe these letters to be the handwriting of the prisoner A I could not swear that No 1 is the prisoner s writing—I think it is—Nos 2 and 3 are his handwriting—No 4 is not so much the character of his handwriting—I believe it to be his writing—think it is Cross-examined Q Do I understand you to say that the first letter you would not speak to A I believe it to be his writing—the fourth letter does not assume the character of the prisoner s handwriting so much as the others do—it is a different style of handwriting—in my judgment Nos 1 2 and 3 are in his ordinary handwriting—there is nothing at all unusual or disguised about them Q If you have seen him write so often and seen his letters so often how came you to hesitate so long A Because my feelings were excited MR CLARKSON A Do you believe the letter No 4 is in the handwriting of the prisoner A I stated it might be his handwriting and it might not Q I am not asking you what you said before the Magistrate but what you have said within the last fire minutes although it is not exactly in the same character do you believe it to be the prisoner s handwriting A Yes I do ANN HATTON I am a widow and was residing at Southampton in November I had made an acquaintance with the prisoner at Cowes—I purchased this velvet dress of the prisoner at Southampton on a Monday in November—it was on the Monday previous to his being taken into custody—this is the box in which the dress was—the prisoner said that a friend of his who was a barrister or who he thought was a barrister had to dispose of it—he said his friend had purchased it for a lady to whom he was on the point of marriage but he had been abroad and from some cause the match was broken off and he had to dispose of it—I paid him three 5l notes I and a sovereign for it—a few days afterwards I heard of his apprehension I communicated

t18420228-1050  1050 ROBERT WILLES GEORGE LLOYD and GEORGE CUNNINGHAM were again indicted for that they having in their custody and possession a certain Bill of Exchange for the payment of 52l 10s 7d on the 11th of February feloniously did forge an endorsement upon the said bill with intent to defraud Charles Monro Johnson —2nd COURT for uttering the same with like intent —3rd and 4th COUNTS stating the intent to be to defraud Stevens Wood MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JACOB RUFFY I live in Mark-lane On the night of the 26th of February my place was broken into and I lost some securities among others this bill for 52l 10s 7d —the endorsement now on it in my name is not in my handwriting—I never authorized any one to sign it for me—I never knew of the endorsement being on it till it was shown to me by Mr Thompson—it was not on it when in my place SAMUEL FLETCHER I live in St Luke s On the 11th of February I went with Lloyd to the Auction-mart—he had this bill in his possession at the time—I saw Baker there and introduced him to him and he introduced him to Mr Wood to get the bill discounted—Mr Wood looked at it and said it was specially endorsed to Mr Ruffy and was not negotiable without Mr Ruffy s endorsement—I left shortly after that Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q You were not before the Justice A No—Davis pointed me out MR BODKIN Q Did you go on the Monday with anybody to get an answer about the bill A I went on the Friday and Saturday but this bill was given to Mr Wood on the Saturday—I went on the Monday—Cunningham waited at a house opposite and said if Mr Wood brought the money for the bill he was to be sent for STEVENS WOOD I know a person named Baker—on the 11th of February he introduced the prisoner Lloyd to me at the Auction-mart—Lloyd produced this bill to me for the purpose of my getting it discounted—I said it was specially endorsed to Mr Ruffy and was not negotiable in that state—he said he would go and get it endorsed—I do not think anybody was present when he said so—Baker might have been there—I asked how long he would be—he said he should be gone about an hour that be bad to go to the Commercial-road—in about an hour he returned and Cunningham and Willes with him—Lloyd produced the bill endorsed as it is now and said it was endorsed as I had requested it to be—the other two were present and might have heard that—I should say they did hear it—they were close enough to do so—some further conversation took place about leaving the bill—Lloyd at first hesitated at leaving the bill with me—Willes said he had known me some length of time and if I gave an undertaking to return the bill or give the cash for it it might be left with safety in my hands and it was so left—Cunningham said nothing—Lloyd said if he could not come next morning I was to give the money or the bill to Mr Cunningham the same as I should do to Lloyd—I had bad some transactions with Willes some two years before and had occasionally met him but had no communication with him on the subject of any bill—on the following morning Cunningham came—I told him I had not succeeded in getting cash for the bill and he had better leave it with me until the Monday and perhaps I might succeed in another quarter—he agreed to that and promised to come on the Monday but I saw no more of him or either of the parties—I was in the City on the Monday and about at various places—I did not go over the way to anybody—I cannot say whether I saw Fletcher that day—I did not see him to speak to him—I do not remember going to a house—I did not see him on Monday the 14th—I made a communication on the subject to Mr Johnson Cross-examined Q Who had you been in the habit of discounting bills for in connexion with this bill A Not in connexion with that bill—I had been in the habit of doing business with Baker who is a commission-agent—I never saw Fletcher before to speak to him—Mr Johnson locked me in his office—I was given in charge in his office on the following Saturday Q When did you first tell anybody that you got the bill from these people A When I was taken into custody—they kept me from the Saturday till the Friday following when I told them where I got it from—I told Mr Johnson when I took the bill to him that I had a bill of his acceptance left with me for discount and the parties had left it five or six days without calling for it and that being the sixth day I did not know what to do with it—I wished to know how to act—I went to him on the Saturday—I expected them to call the Monday before for the bill JOHN FREDERICK COBET On the 10th of February Cunningham and Willes came to my place to get some bills discounted—one of them took the bills out of his pocket—they were both in the room at the time but a little distance one from the other—the second bill wanted an endorsement it being specially endorsed to Jacob Ruffy Esq —I asked him whether his name was Ruffy—on his saying no I asked him whether he was the holder—he said he was—on my saying I could not make up my mind about the bills they said they had got another bill of 50l odd which they promised to bring me the next day—I hesitated feeling suspicious of the matter and yet not liking to impeach anybody I suspended my judgment till I saw that bill which they were to bring next day—it was stated that Mr Ruffy s endorsement could easily be got—I believe they bothe said so—I was ill in bed at the time and could not exactly state but I think it was said by both—Willes placed himself more towards the window after having introduced the other—he took part in a certain portion of the conversation—to the best of my recollection he said that could easily be got—believe it emanated from him but I am not certain—I recollect Cunningham saying that he knew little about bills—they left me to return next day with the the third bill and next day Cunningham came COURT Q If Willes said so Cunningham must have heard it A All that Willes said Cunningham must have heard but not the contrary because Willes happens to be deaf—if it passed the presence of both—Cunningham returned about the middle of the following day the 11th—he did not bring me the 501 bill—on that occasion I gave him a caution about the bills—when I found the third bill was not forthcoming I saw there was a backwardness to convince me the bills were honestly got—I let loose my impressions that they were improperly obtained told him I was old enough to be his father and said Suppose these bills have been found —he said Well suppose they have —that was enough to raise my suspicion and for that reason I said I would have nothing to do with it and that I would advise him not to have any thing to do with it for there must be forgery committed before the bill specially endorsed could be negotiated—I said there must be fraud in one case—and forgery in the other—neither of those was the bill in question I never saw that ROBERT BAKER I am acquainted with Fletcher I introduced Lloyd through Fletcher to Wood to have the bill discounted—it was about one o clock as near as I can say at the Auction-mart—I took no notice of the conversation Cross-examined Q What are you A An agent Fletcher is not a friend of mine—I have known him ten or twelve yean—I heard of his being in trouble some time ago—he introduced me to Lloyd—I did not make a bargain about what I was to have for my trouble in the matter—I expected if any business was done I should have a commission—I did not stipulate for it—I had a friend in the parlour at the time and went to him—I have been in the habit of getting bills discounted but I knew nothing about foreign bills—I did not go to see the parties about the endorsement of the bill—Wood came and said he could not get the bill without giving an undertaking for it—I did not hear the prisoners say thing about the endorsement as I was not there CHARLES WALLER I am a City police inspector While I was inquiring into this matter on the subject of the 521 bill I saw Willes on a Saturday at the station—I said nothing then—I saw him again on a Monday and he said he knew all about it—I said All about what —he said he could put me in the way of apprehending the parties that broke into the place and did it—he said he had bills in his possession—I asked him what bills—he said he had the three bills in his possession—I had the 52l 10s bill in my possession at the time and showed it to him—he said that was one of them—I asked him where the other two were—he said they were burnt—I asked him how he knew that—he said he saw them burnt that there was a quarrel among them and that was the reason the other two were burnt Cross-examined Q I believe Cunningham rendered you all the assistance in his power A He did Willes was alone when we had the conversation COURT Q In what way did Cunningham render you assistance A He showed me the residence of Davis Clarke and Saint where to find them—I mean assistance as to the charge of housebreaking—I had no conversation with Cunningham about the endorsed bill—I took the three into custody by his information—I told Lloyd he was charged with the robbery as well as the forgery—he said he knew nothing about the forgery—this was after the examination before the Magistrate Willes What I said was that Packer told me he saw the two small bills burnt and the 52l bill I only had about five minutes in my possession Witness That is not so—he said he had the three bills in his possession and he saw the two bills burnt and a lot more papers besides as much as a little basket would hold Willes I said I had heard there had been some papers burnt but I had not seen them Witness You said you saw them burnt and you had a quantity of papers in your possession and that even Mr Ruffy did not know what he had lost yet Willes I said I understood there was a Long Annuity warrant for 500l they had in their possession but I had not seen it you said there was no such thing lost and I said Well I have heard there was MR RUFFY re-examined There was in my place a certificate of a Government Annuity of 30l which had been purchased for my sister—the consideration given for it was about 500l or 600l —that was not taken away from my place CHARLES MONRO JOHNSON I am the acceptor of this bill—it was brought to me on the 19th of February the day it was due by Wood who made a communication to me respecting it Bill read — Madeira 13th December 1841 At thirty days sight pay this first of Exchange—second and third not being paid—to John Taylor Esq or order value balance of port charges To Mr JohnsonRowland Martin Payable at the London and Westminster Bank Endorsed J RUFFY ROBERT HAMBLIN I am a City policeman On the evening of the 23rd when Clarke Saint and Davis were taken into custody I was going along Bishopsgate-street with Willes—it was raining at the time and he voluntarily said pointing to the umbrella I had I saw as many papers burnt belonging to Mr Ruffy as would fill that umbrella if it was inverted —he said he had seen two bills burnt over a b—y quarrel between the parties Cross-examined Q Where did you understand the burning took place A I do not recollect whether he said where it took place—I do not think I asked him—I have no recollection of it Q Try and recollect yourself Did you hear any thing about the Rum Puncheon A I have heard too much about it but not at that time MR BODKIN Q Where is the Rum Puncheon A In Rose and Crown-court a few yards out of the City MR PAYNE to CHARLES WALLER Q Do you remember Willes saying to Lloyd I took the bill to a person named Ruffy to get the name written on the back A There was something said I abort a bill taken to Mr Ruffy but I cannot recollect whether Willes said it or not—I did not hear it—I did not give Lloyd a pen and ink to write something down—I will swear I did not—nor a piece of paper—I saw nothing signed by Lloyd or Packer—Willes did not say when it was he knew of the Long Annuity—he said Mr Ruffy was a foolish man he did not know what he had lost for there was as much burnt as a basket would hold—he did not say when or where it was burnt Willes s Defence As regards the forgery I know nothing about it It was taken away either by Lloyd or Cunningham to get endorsed and brought back again to the Auction-mart and Cunningham hesitated to leave it with Wood I said to Wood Give him an undertaking that you will return him the bill or money I left the place and went to Brixton where I had business When I returned I understood I was wanted and I gave them every information I could being in the habit of getting bills discounted It was not for me to ask them about the bills I introduced the parties to the party to discount them and I have nothing more to do They learn from the parties how to get them As to the third bill in question it never went to Cobet but to Wood With respect to asking them how they come by the bills I have nothing to do with that the party who discounts makes all these inquiries and takes all the responsibility I had it not in my possession five minutes There seems to have been a mistake as to my seeing the papers burnt I did not I was told so by the landlord of the house and it must be a misunderstanding of the officers I might not have heard distinctly being deaf While they were gone to get the bill indorsed I was on business with other people at the Auction-mart and when they came back I said Leave it with Wood if be gives you an undertaking to return the bill or the money I have a character to lose and I acted in the way I have said I was not in the secret of the transaction I only had to introduce the men to get the bill discounted and it is hard I should be considered a party who stole the bill It was morally impossible for me to tell how they came by them and I was not to ask them that was the business of the party discounting them They should have gone to Mr Ruffy and asked if it was correct I have not the slightest knowledge who did endorse it or of the parties who committed the robbery only from hearsay from the landlord of the house and the parties with me I do not frequent the house Lloyd came with his brother and asked if I knew where he could get money on the bills that he was in distress at the time having his goods seized for rent They were introduced to Wood in an indirect manner by me I thought the thing was straightforward and acted upon that impression as innocently as possible While they went to get the bill endorsed I stopped in the Auction-mart in the tap-room with other parties on business When Wood was in custody I gave every information I was able but was not aware there was any thing wrong till the policemen sent for me I was out four or five days with them till the parties were taken then they turned round and I was placed in custody with them I forwarded every information I was in possession of to the proper quarter I leave it in the hands of the Jury to decide if I was wrong—I did not know I was doing wrong THOMAS BROWN I am an attorney and live in No 37 Cumberland-street Hackney-road I have known Willes fifteen years—I know he has been in the habit of getting bills discounted for parties—I have myself handed him thirty or forty bills in that period some he has returned not being able to get them discounted and others he has got done—I know he was in the habit of going to the Auction-mart to Baker s coffee-house where a number of agents go—I have seen bills passed across there for the purpose of getting discounted MR BODKIN Q How long have you been an attorney A I was admitted on the 28th of December 1833—I have not taken out my certificate for four years but I have it now—I was clerk to Mr Atkinson of No 27 Carey-street COURT Q Did you ever put in suit any of the bills you had from him A None whatever MR BODKIN Q Do you carry on any business in Cumberland-street A I do not carry on business at all—I do not go to the Auction-mart except to see a few persons I know—I do no business there either in discount or otherwise—I only go to see Mr Spencer a clerk in the Bank—I have not heard that any of the bills I saw pass there were stolen—it is the Auction mart coffee-house—I was never there above twenty times—I do not know that it is called the tap—I should say it was the coffee-room—the tables are covered over with tablecloths and dinner and lunch set out for gentlemen in the mart to come down and dine—it is not where the cads of the omnibuses go—I should say I have given from twenty to thirty bills to Willes—I got them from time to time—I have been in the habit of having bills given me to get discounted and I gave them to him for that purpose—it is three or four years since I gave him a bill to discount but I have seen him constantly since—I have known him fifteen years—I hare seen him in London-wall and at No 1 Bell-alley and other places—I have not handed him bills at all those places—I have done so at Pledger s at the Castle public-house at Moorgate—they were bills put in my possession by my clients to get discounted WILLES— GUILTY Aged 42 LLOYD— GUILTY Aged 22 CUNNINGHAM— GUILTY Aged 26

t18420822-2502  2502 WILLIAM JOSEPH LAYEL was indicted for feloniously uttering on the 13th of May a forged acceptance to a bill of exchange for 100l well knowing it to be forged with intent to defraud James Alsford JAMES ALSFORD I am a dealer in mahogany and live at No 23 Grove-street Commercial-road On the 21st of May a person named Moss called on me to ask if I could discount this bill for 100l —I said I could not then I had not more than 25l in the house—on the 23rd he introduced the prisoner to me and I paid him 20l —he did not say a word to me—the agreement was drawn up between me and the prisoner but the transaction was between Mr Moss and the prisoner—this is the agreement—I saw the prisoner write it—I took it from the evidence of Mr Moss that it was a genuine good bill—I do not recollect the prisoner mentioning that—I paid the prisoner 20l that evening and he was agreeable to take it and on or before Friday the remainder of the money was to he paid to him—I paid him the remaining 60l on the Thursday—the bill was offered to me at 80l —it is a two months bill—it had within a few days of two months to run—when it became due it was presented and refused—the prisoner put the bill into my hands after endorsing it—he said nothing to me about it—Mr Moss was the agent between the two Bill read — 100l London May 17th 1842 Two months after date pay to my order 100l for value received WILLIAM JOSEPH LATEL Accepted JOSEPH LAYEL No 13 Cottage-grove Mile End-road Payable at No 6 Finch-lane Cornhill London JOSEPH LAYEL I live at No 13 Cottage-grove Mile End-road I have no connexion with Finch-lane in business—the prisoner is my son—he had no authority to draw on me—I never accepted this bill—he has no funds in my possession—he has never drawn bills on me before—I never had any conversation with my daughter about accepting this bill Cross-examined by MR LUCAS Q I suppose if your son becomes indebted and enters into obligations you do not object to answer them A Not for a moment JAMES SAMUEL MOSS I live at No 5 Cannon-street-road The prisoner brought me a copy of this bill which the officer has in his possession and asked me if I could get any thing of that sort done—he said he had had a very serious conversation with his father and that his father had agreed to accept a 100l bill for the benefit of himself and his sister who held some money in the Accountant-General s hand in the Bank of England and she was to repay it when she became of age—I knew that the prisoner was living at home with his father under great difficulties and in great distress—I had it for a day or two and applied to several of my neighbours to know if they could do any thing of the sort—we knew the young man not to possess any thing and so I represented to Mr Alsford—it was done on the strength of the respectability of the elder Mr Layel—I applied to Mr Alsford on Saturday morning the 21st and said Here is a young man who has been like a great many more rather wild at home— I knew that and expressed it particularly to Mr Alsford —the father seems inclined to serve them as the sister has got some money has brought me a 100l bill which he wants discounted —he said If you had come last night and it is a real thing I could have done it but I have paid all my money away and have not got above 20l —I met him again on Saturday afternoon—I had no idea at that moment that the bill would be done—however we were to make inquiry to get news of the elder Mr Layel—I had not the slightest doubt of the prisoner s representation that his father would do it—I told Mr Alsford that the best way would be to depute some one to go to Mr Layel s house and make inquiry and he asked me to do it as he was rather busy—I went and the prisoner was standing at the street-door in his shirt-sleeves and his tooth-brush in his hand as if just up—I said Good morning I have come to see the old gentleman —he replied Oh he got so terribly lushy last night when we had company he is not up yet —he asked me into the parlour—the place seemed all in confusion and it seemed feasible that company had been there—he went up stairs knocked at a door came down again and said The old man is too lushy to get up yet sit down —I said No thank you I will go and get a glass of beer —he said I will have breakfast shave myself and come down —I went to a public-house and stopped there three-quarters of an hour and as I was coming away hardly intending to go back again I met the prisoner near the end of the street—I said I was just going—he said Well I can t help it I have been out some little way come in perhaps the old man is about now —we went into the parlour and his sister came in—he said Martha go up and tell the old man or father I will not swear which that the person is come here about the bill —she went up and in a short time came down with a piece of paper in her hand with The Bill written on the outside which was the envelope and gave it into the prisoner s hands—he said to her What did the old man say — Why she said all he said was There it is don t make a fool of it —I said Oh is that all he said —the prisoner opened the envelope and wanted to show it to me—I said I am not going to do it — Oh they said it is a 100l bill with two months date on it —he put it in the envelope and put it into his pocket—we then walked up to London together went to the Duke of Gloucester had dinner and a little brandy afterwards—at three o clock we went to Mr Alsford—I had promised to go to him in the middle of the day to tell him the result of the inquiry I made at the house—we had three or four tumblers of brandy and water but that was afterwards between five and six and we had something at the Red Lion—Mr Alsford went with me to the Red Lion—I should think the prisoner was drunk at the time Mr Alsford came—I judged so from his writing that he made a memorandum—he was quite capable of taking care of himself—he had drank enough to make his hand shake Q And when he was drunk he agreed to take £20 for the present A No I do not consider he was very drunk—there is a good deal of difference in what is called being drunk and fresh—he was not so drunk but he knew what he was about—I told him Alsford had not got the money—he said You know my situation I am very short I don t want people denying me I want a few pounds —I think he was drunk when he wrote the agreement and he certainly was when he uttered the bill—I consider Alsford was sober but I had been drinking myself and I never know after I take a drop of grog—I was in a drunken state—I did not think it a strange proposition if the father was a good man to pay £20 for the use of the money for two months for I had heard several accounts of the old gentleman as being very eccentric and a man that never paid any debts without giving a bill for them—the prisoner scarcely knew who was going to discount the bill and he said to me in the morning I hope it is not going into any Jew discounter s hands for my father has been punished so much through them with me —I most decidedly thought it was a good bill—if I had not thought so I should not have recommended it—the daughter brought it down as if the father had written it up-stairs otherwise it would not have been done by my recommendation—I believed it to be a bona fide transaction Q Pray How much did you get in this transaction A I had 1l of the prisoner which I did not ask for he gave it me of his own accord as we were going away from the house after he had signed the agreement—I had £5 of Mr Alsford besides—I have not returned that to him yet JURY Q How do you get your living A I am an engraver by business—this was the first transaction of the kind I ever had—I cannot tell How the prisoner came to apply to me—he was not a particular friend of mine—I have met him at the Prince of Hesse public-house and he was accepted at that room which I have been in the habit of using—he was looked on as a neighbour and a companion and on one occasion he asked me if I could call on Fryer and Locksly about a sum of £1700 in Chancery and on that occasion I saw his writing in pencil which was nock better than this—I do not see the slightest resemblance to his handwriting in this—I never saw the father write—I never discounted a bill—I have been acquainted with Mr Alsford for some time COURT Q Did it not occur to you as remarkable that Mr Alsford should ask £20 A It was offered by the prisoner—there was no specific agreement as to what I was to get—when the prisoner gave me the pound he said I suppose Mr Alsford will satisfy you —I said I am quite satisfied he will do what is right Q How did you know that Mr Alsford would do the thing A I did not know that he would—I scarcely had any idea that he would when I went to him—I shall have to resign Mr Alsford his money that he gave me—it has not been a good thing for me—I could have earned almost the £100 in the time besides the trouble and the anxiety it has put me to JOSEPH LAYEL re-examined My daughter Jives in my house and acts as my servant—I do not recollect her coming up to me one morning—I am in the habit of being out of my place by half-past eight o clock every morning—my daughter is not here—I did not know it was requisite or else she should have been here—she brought down the note innocently I believe and gave it to my son and my son gave it to Mr Moss—I had not taken any thing too much the over night—all this about my being lushy and so on is an untruth an invention made up—I was never asked to sign such a note—I had never signed any notes for my son—I understand the note was left in my daughter s bed-room and she brought it down to him—I cannot say positively whose handwriting this acceptance is—I have no opinion about it—it is not mine—I see no resemblance to my son s writing in it—I do not believe it is his writing—I do not know whose it is—I have no idea—I do not believe it to be a feigned hand—it is not at all like my writing—my son is not well acquainted with my handwriting writing—he seldom saw me write—I signed my name to my deposition—I did not authorise this acceptance to be written—there is property in the bands of the Accountant General coming to my daughter when she is of age—it falls to the family in consequence of the death of the mother two years and a half ago—I never employed my daughter or any body to write for me or sign my name for me—I never put my hand to an acceptance without taking the bill up—my son had not applied to me to accept any such bill— looking at the copy of the bill —I had no communication with my son about that paper that I positively swear—he never had any communication with me whatever on the subject of my accepting such a bill—I know nothing of my daughter having the bill—I do not know where my daughter is now—she has been away from me three or four weeks—she left me two or three weeks after this charge was made against the prisoner—I did not take her before the Magistrate—I knew nothing of her going away—I have not heard from her since—I have every reason to believe that she is in the country with a son of mine at Dagenham—if I had been aware she would be wanted she should have been here with me but I was not—I am not aware that I have been asked many times for her—I believe Mr Most has called and he wanted her WILLIAM LAPWORTH police-sergeant K 22 I took a constable with me to apprehend the prisoner and took him to the station—I found on him several bills that have not been negociated but nothing connected with this case—the bill in question the copy and the agreement were handed over to me at Lambeth-street by the Magistrate s wish and I have produced them—I believe the daughter is kept out of the way—I endeavoured first of all to apprehend her—I afterwards thought it would answer the purpose to summons her as a witness but I have not been able to find her—I have applied for her attendance and used every effort—I have not asked the father for her—the clerk at Lambeth-street said the father was not bound to produce her—I have used every other means to produce her—I went to the father s house for her JAMES ALSFORD re-examined The body of this agreement is the prisoner s writing—I saw him write it—I do not know that he was drunk when he wrote it—he dictated it himself—I signed it first HENRY MILSTSD I am a policeman I took the prisoner in charge at the Commercial Coffee-house London-road—I went up stairs and knocked at the door—he opened it—I said Your name is Layel —he said yes—I said I am come to take you into custody for forging a bill of 300l —he said Well I suppose it is all over with me now or this time —he put on his clothes and went with me—before the Magistrate he denied having said this—he had been in custody before but not of me my sergeant had him and I was with him when he apprehended him J S MOSS re-examined When the bill became over due Mr Alsford and I went into Turner s the lawyers in Whitechapel-road and when we applied to them to proceed criminally against the prisoner and his sister the clerk there said It is very much like old Mr Layel s writing —Turner was their attorney—he had some casein hand for the old gentleman before MR LAYEL re-examined My daughter s expectations are beyond 100l —she has never endeavoured to persuade me to give my name to my son nor promised to make it good to me—she is nineteen years of age Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Had not your son applied to you about advancing him a sum of money for the purpose of taking him abroad A He has been anxious to go abroad for some length of time and for me to get a sum of money to assist him in doing so but it has not been in my power to do it—he has said that several times in consequence of not getting any thing to do he has asked me for money—I cannot say that it was for the specific object of taking him abroad—he mentioned several times that he should like to go abroad if he could get a steward s place or something of that sort—he has very likely applied to me once or twice on that subject GUILTY Aged 26 — Transported for Seven Years

payment of 5l knowing it to be forged with intent to defraud the Governor and Company of the Bank of England —2nd COUNT stating his intent to be to defraud Samuel Sparrow Wallis and another ANN WILLITER I am single and live at No 12 Carpenter-street Horseferry-road I have been a servant but am not in service now—I have known the prisoner twelve months—I was in his company at Westminster on Tuesday morning the 13th of Dec between nine and ten o clock I had been to the play with him the night before he gave me a 5l note to pay a deposit on an apartment—we were unfortunately going to get married—it was to pay a deposit on the apartment and the price of a ring—the apartment was to be at Charing-cross or Oxford-street—I accompanied him that morning to St James s-park—we walked through St James s-park and opposite the Horse-guards I left him—I was to see him that afternoon at half-past three o clock in Regent-street—the apartment was to be about 5s or 10s a week—I went home to Mrs Batchelor a friend of mine and gave the note to her—she lived in the same house as me—I went with her to Mr Wallis s a linen-draper s to change the note—it was changed there—we bought a pair of gloves a cap and some cap-ribbon which came to about 2s 4d —I kept the change till I found the note was bad—next morning somebody came—Mrs Batchelor s name and address was given and put on the note when it was paid away Prisoner Q When you took the note home what did you do with it A I gave it to Mrs Batchelor—she took it to the linen-draper s—she did not take it anywhere else first—she took it up to another lodger in the house to ask if it was a good one and the lodger said yes they believed it was a good one—I did not take it up myself—Mrs Batchelor changed the note—it was never in my hands after I gave it to her HANNAH BATCHELOR I am the wife of Isaac Batchelor and live at No 12 Coventry-street On the 14th of Dec Williter gave me a 5l note to pay a deposit for a room and to buy a ring—I showed it to Mrs Edwards a lodger in my house—I did not lose sight of it—it was not changed—I put it in my bosom—I had no other note there—I went with Williter to Messrs Wallis and Southwold in Parliament-street and bought some things for her which came to 2s 4d —I paid the 5l note for them and got change—I gave my name and address which was written on the note in my presence—I am sure the note my name was written on was the same as I received from Williter—I took the change off the counter and put it into Williter s purse GEORGE DOUGLAS I am in the service of Samuel Sparrow Wallis and Mr Southwold I remember Williter and Batchelor coming to the shop and purchasing articles to the amount of between 2s and 3s which Batchelor gave a 5l note for—I asked her name and address which I wrote on the same note—the note now produced is it and has the writing on it—I wrote it first in pencil but in the evening having doubts about it I wrote it in ink JOSHUA FREEMAN I am inspector of Bank of England notes at the Bank and have been so twenty-six years I have examined this note—it is forged in paper plate and signature—it is not the signature of the cashier it purports to bear—I am well acquainted with his signature WILLIAM MORAN I am an inspector of the B division of police On Wednesday evening the 14th of Dec in consequence of previous information I was inside the house No 12 Carpenter-street—the prisoner came to the door and I apprehended him at the door—I told him he was charged by the witness Williter with having uttered a forged note to her—she was present at the time—I think I told him it was a 5l Bank-note—I told him it was my duty to caution him that whatever he might say I must name elsewhere and if he wished to say anything it was my duty to hear it—he said I shall say nothing at all about it but immediately afterwards he said I will tell you all about it I took it at the fight down the country when he knocked at the door a female opened it—he refused to come in—I was in the parlour—he could not see me—the female asked him to walk in—he declined but asked if Ann was in—the female said Yes walk in —he declined to come in and waited at the door—I went out to him I searched him and found on him a key 2s and a note addressed to Williter—he at first said his name was Henry Miles—he afterwards said his name was not Miles that they called him Miles s boy but his name was Henry Eastgate—he at first said he lived at No 5 Arundel-terrace White Conduit-fields—I said I should go there—he then said he did not live there but his friends resided there—I afterwards learnt that some notes had been found in the street and a spot was pointed out to me in Carpenter-street about twelve feet from No 12 where he was apprehended—in going from the house to the station with him I had passed that spot but the notes lay on the right and he was on my left—I do not think he could pass that spot on leaving the house but in coming to it he might or anybody standing at the door might easily have thrown them there Prisoner Q How did I decline coming in A You were asked by the female to come in and you declined—I could not exactly catch you words to say what you said—you might have said you were in a hurry—you made no resistance to my taking you—you could have thrown the notes away before I came out of the parlour—you saw me come out of the parlour followed by two men and there was a light in the passage THOMAS BUCKINGHAM I am a coal-porter and live at No 2 Bennett s-yard Westminster On the 15th of Dec at a quarter before eight o clock in the morning I was in Carpenter-street and picked up some paper about two yards and a half from No 12—it was about two feet and a half from the pavement on the road—I found it was two 5l notes wrapped up in a piece of sugar paper—I gave them to Mr Edgar in about twenty minutes—I had not parted with them before—I took them to him in the coal-yard which is about a hundred yards from Carpenter-street—it was rather dirty weather—the paper is not here—there was no soil on it as if it had been there any time—the notes were not out of my sight till I gave them to Mr Edgar Prisoner Q Do you think they had laid there all night were they damp with the dew of the night A They were dry when I picked them up—they were rolled up in brown paper which also seemed fresh—it was rather a damp morning—it was wet the night before EDWARD EDGAR I am clerk to Mr Lucas a coal-merchant in Milbank-street About nine o clock in the morning Buckingham gave me two 5l notes and asked me if they were good—I thought them bad—I kept them and they were marked before I parted with them and marked by him in the inspector s presence—he told me he found them that morning about a quarter to eight o clock—I locked them up and kept possession of them till I delivered them to the inspector—these are the two notes—Buckingham put his mark on them as he could not write WILLIAM MORAN re-examined I received these two notes from Edgar—they are Nos 876 and 877—I put Buckingham s name on them and he put his mark—they are the same notes GEORGE DOUGLAS re-examined On Wednesday evening the 14th of December I went to No 12 Carpenter-street and remained inside the house—the prisoner came to the door—I followed the inspector and saw the prisoner at the door—the inspector collared him—the prisoner s hands at that time appeared to me to be in his pocket—they were not hanging down—when he was collared he made a motion appearing to attempt to escape—he turned quite on one side as if to escape—that motion brought him nearer the curb—he did not move half a foot perhaps—he was searched in the parlour JOSHUA FREEMAN re-examined These two notes are forged in every particular and are impressions from the same plate—the number is put in afterwards by hand—it is quite a distinct operation—the same plate will serve for thousands—we never have two notes of the same number and date—the first note I saw is from the same plate as the others—it is the same date and purports to be signed by the same cashier—the first note is No 627 and has 37 in the margin—that is part of the plate—this is a copy of a plate used on the 14th—it is all the same paper and there has been an attempt at a water mark done by pressure GEORGE DOUGLAS re-examined The inspector seized the prisoner by his right collar—he turned to the right—he turned sideways swung round and his right side got a trifle nearer the curb WILLIAM MORAN re-examined It was eight o clock in the evening when I took him—he made no resistance but by my touching him with some force it might have altered the position of his body—whether it was his own act or mine in seizing him I cannot say—I was on duty all that night and it was a fine night—it did not rain all night—there was a wooden barrier at the end of Carpenter-street and no traffic of horses or carriages Prisoner to MRS BATCHELOR Q How do you obtain your living A By my labour—I have a husband and he lives with me—I only knew Williter stop out one night while she was at my house—I never knew her come there after keeping company with another person—my husband is a horse-keeper and has 21s a week—I never knew any one come there courting Williter but you—I do not know where she was the night she stopped out—she left the house by herself Prisoner s Defence I took the note at a fight for a bet GUILTY Aged 36 *— Transported for Fourteen Years 
t18430102-455  455 WILLIAM BRADY was indicted for feloniously forging and uttering on the 5th of Dec a warrant for the payment of 18l 10s with intent to defraud Edward Majoribank and others —2 other Counts stating his intent to be to defraud Jacob James Hart MESSERS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution CHARLES BOLTON I am cashier in the banking-house of Messrs Coutts and Co —Edward Majoribanks is one of the partners—there are several—Mr Hart has an account at our house—on the 5th of Dec a cheque for 18l 10s 6d pur-porting to be drawn by him was presented—I cannot say by whom—this now produced is it—I paid it myself in three 5l notes Nos 88024 88025 and 88026 dated the 1st of Nov 1842 and 3l 10s 6d cash—this other cheque for 3l 7s 6d I paid on the 7th of Dec Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You have no recollection of the prisoner A None whatever—it is possible if I saw the man I might remember him—I have no impression that it was the prisoner JACOB JAMES HART I live in Pall Mall East and did so in Dec last in the house of two ladies named Proctor—I keep an account at Messrs Coutts —the prisoner was servant in the house I live in for about two months before this happened—he waited on me occasionally—I was generally in the habit of paying for my lodging and other little things by cheques on Coutts—I have on several occasions given the prisoner cheques for Miss Proctor—I gave him the cheque produced for 3l 7s 6d dated the 3rd of Dec on the 5th of Dec about breakfast time—I kept my blank cheque-book in a paper box with a patent Bramah lock to it on my sideboard in my sitting-room—I always locked it when I went out and took the key with me—when I was in the house the key was usually in the box—I have since examined my chequebook and miss one or two cheques—the cheque for 18l 10s 6d produced is not my handwriting nor was it written by my authority or knowledge Cross-examined Q Do not you remember that on the 5th of Dec the prisoner was the servant who attended you A Yes—I do not know that the other servants had left the house during that day—I know nothing about it—Miss Proctor who keeps the house I believe was not in the house and I desired him to give the cheque to her sister—I am not aware that some work which the female servants used to do for me was done by the prisoner that day—I have not any recollection of it whatever—I am quite certain this cheque for 18l 10s 6d is not my handwriting—it is dated the 3rd of Dec and so is my cheque which I gave him but I gave it him on the 5th—I wrote it on Saturday evening and gave it him on Monday morning—I believe Miss Proctor had been absent from home some time—I never saw another male servant about the house—one or two cheques have been abstracted from the centre of my cheque-book—the cheque-book was not shown to my bankers before I misled them—it was not out of my hands before I missed them—I kept it in my paper box in my sitting-room—the servants had not access to the room to clean while I was in the house—I scarcely ever saw a servant in my room except the prisoner—when I went out I did not lock the room-door I locked ray box but when I was at home my keys were generally in it—I left them in my box till I was going out MARY ANN PROCTOR I keep the house in Pall Mall East The prisoner came into my service on the 17th of October last—he was in the habit of making out memorandums of disbursements on my account—he made out small bills and things—I never saw him write—I have settled with him on the accounts he has presented to me—I have had memorandums made out by him which I have acted on—I have looked at this cheque for 18l 10s 6d —it is not like Mr Hart s writing—the figures and the letters are certainly very much like the prisoner s but I never saw the prisoner write—I should think it is very like the prisoner s handwriting—I believe under the circumstances that it is the prisoner s writing COURT Q Supposing you had seen that paper independent of any charge of forgery or anything whose handwriting should you believe it to be A If there was no charge against the man I could not dream whose it could be MR BODKIN Q If it was shown to you and you were asked whose handwriting it was without reference to any charge whose should you believe it to be from the character of the handwriting A The prisoner s independent of the circumstances—I never received this cheque for 3l 6d from the prisoner nor the money for it—he left my service on the 17th or 18th of Dec —I had not dismissed him—I had given him warning—his warning would have expired the week after he left but he had agreed to remain—he did not tell me he was going to leave—two month s wages were due to him—he did not apply to me for them—no inquiry was made at my house from the bankers the day before he went away Cross-examined Q Was there not a person at times in the habit of coming there A Not to my knowledge—I had been away from home about a month—the housemaid has to clean Mr Hart s room—I cannot tell who was at home on the 5th of Dec —my sister came to me that day—I should imagine that the other servants were not out that day but I do not know—if this cheque was put into my hand by any one unconnected with this case I could not tell whose handwriting I believed it to be COURT Q Then independent of the transaction you have no belief whose handwriting it is A Before this transaction I never noticed the man s writing sufficiently but after this the papers I have found in his handwriting were so much like it I said immediately it was his—by the examination of those papers I could form a knowledge of his handwriting—I should now say without reference to the present charge that this cheque is his writing MR PRENDERGAST Q The knowledge or belief you have of his writing its belief you had not at all when this matter first attracted your attention A I never thought of his handwriting before—before this transaction took place I had no belief at all as to what the prisoner s handwriting might be—the cheque was first put into my hand on the Sunday morning—when I saw it I thought it looked very like the prisoner s handwriting and on comparing it with some bills I had of his I was confirmed—my belief is founded on the comparison which I made and on that only COURT Q Have you the documents here A I believe so—they are two small bills—they were both given to the police inspector MR PRENDERGAST Q Your belief is founded on comparing this with these two documents which the prisoner produced to you but which you did not see him write A Yes MR BODKIN Q Are these the papers of which you have been speaking producing two papers A Yes—these are not the only two occasions on which I have settled accounts with him—I have done so several times but the others are destroyed—when the cheque was first put into my hand I believed it was the prisoner s handwriting—the belief I entertained of the handwriting was founded on the settlements I had with him with the written papers—I afterwards looked for the papers and found these two JURY Q Do you know Mr Hart s writing A Yes very well—I have never had a letter from him but I have repeatedly seen him write cheques—if this cheque had been shown to me by a stranger I should certainly have said it was not Mr Hart s ELLEN PROCTOR I am sister of last witness and reside with her I was at home on the 5th of Dec in the early part of the morning but I went out to spend the day—the prisoner did not on that day give me this cheque or account to me for the produce of it—he gave me 3l 7s 6d the amount of it on the 6th on account of Mr Hart—the amount of Mr Hart s bill that week was 3l 8s 6d —I remember the policeman coming to our house—I was ill in bed—I saw Haines on the Sunday morning before Christmasday—the prisoner slept in a room adjoining the kitchen on the basement—it would be his duty to receive letters if any came for Mr Hart—he gave me no notice of his intention to leave the morning he left—he left on Saturday the 17th Dec the day before the police came Cross-examined Q I believe you know the cause of his leaving there was something with some female was there not A Not that I know—I went out between eleven and twelve o clock and was out the whole day JOHN HAINES I am an inspector of the A division of police On Sunday the 18th of Dec in consequence of information I went to the house of Miss Proctor and was shown into a room on the basement next the kitchen said to be the prisoner s room—I there found these two books—I produced these books before the prisoner at the station on Friday the 27th and he said this with the yellow cover was his book and the other was not his but he was going to have some fresh leaves put into it—I saw the prisoner write this note—having seen him write this note I can form a belief as to the handwriting of this 18l cheque—I believe the cheque to be the prisoner s handwriting—there are several of the letters very remarkable as well as the figures—I have likewise a letter sent to his wife which he acknowledged to be his handwriting—I got it from his wife—he told me he had written to her—I showed it to him and said Is this the letter you wrote —he said Yes —I said Is this your handwriting —he said Yes —I have compared that and the cheque together and have not the least doubt whatever that the cheque is his writing Cross-examined Q Did not he tell you that one of the books had been given to him A No—he did not say the housemaid had given one to him—he said this book was not his but he was going to have fresh leaves pot into it—he did not say it was given to him to have fresh leaves put into it—I am pretty positive that I have used his words—I am sure he did not say that anything was given to him by the housemaid or by the cook—he did not say a word about the cook FREDERICK SHAW I am a sergeant of the A division of police I had a communication made to me about this forgery in Dec last and looked for the prisoner—I apprehended him on Thursday the 22nd of Dec —I met him in the street and stopped him from the description I had of him—I asked him if his name was William Brady—he said No that is not my name —I took him by the arm and told him I should trouble him to walk with me—after walking a few yards with him I asked his name—he then said My name is William Brady —I took him at the corner of the Haymarket JOHN BOOKER I am shopman to Mr Newton a pawnbroker in Duke-street Manchester-square I know the prisoner—he pledged a coat and waistcoat with me—I do not remember the transaction but the duplicate is dated 17th of Oct 1842—that must have been the day—I remember his coming to redeem it—to the best of my belief it was on the 5th of Dec —I cannot remember the time of day—it was pledged in the name of John Brady No 12 Bryanston-square—he paid 10s 4d to redeem it—he gave me a 5l Bank of England note—this is it—I wrote his name on it—he gave me his address No 29 Tavistock-square—I made a memorandum on the note of the date—it is the 5th of Dec —I have written 5th—12—42 on it—it is No 88 026 dated 1st of Nov 1842 Cross-examined Q Are you sure the prisoner is the party A Quite sure—the things were pawned in the name of John Brady on the 17th of Oct —on the 5th of Dec I asked his name—he said Mr Brady —I had seen him I should say a dozen times—I knew his name but it occasionally happens that people do not pledge in their own names and when we take notes we wish to have the proper names and address MR HART re-examined I found a letter from Messrs Coutts on my breakfast table on the 17th the morning the prisoner left—he had left before it was brought into my room - - PERRING I live at No 29 Tavistock-square I never saw the prisoner before—he did not live in my house in Dec last The cheques being read were both made payable to Miss Proctor GUILTY Aged 27 — Transported for Fourteen Years

Trinity Term during part of the trial of the cause Bailey against Smith upon a promissory note for the sum of 2 875l —it lasted two days—after the trial certain documents were impounded and placed in my hands—I have them here—I produce a promissory note marked A for 2 875l a receipt marked B an I O U marked C a letter marked D and a book marked E indorsed Private cash account —I was present part of the time that the prisoner Dr Bailey was examined ROBERT HOOPER TOLCHER I am a short-hand writer I attended the trial of Bailey against Smith on the 8th and 9th of July last in the Court of Common Pleas—I took short-hand notes of the whole of the trial—the prisoner was examined as a witness—I recollect several documents being handed to him while being examined—one was a promissory note—I took down the evidence he gave respecting that promissory note—I afterwards wrote it out—this is a correct transcript of my notes Portions of the evidence given by the prisoner were here read of which the following is a narrative — I am a clergyman of the Established Church and a graduate of Trinity College Dublin I am officiating at present at St Peter s Queen-square Westminster—I have had that church three years last Oct —I am licensed by the Bishop of London to serve that church—I am the brother of the plaintiff Miss Bailey—my father lived at Belfast—he died in June 1841—I had been acquainted with Robert Smith the intestate nearly for the last ten years—my father gave me a letter of introduction to him when I first came to London—some money transactions took place between us—this memorandum will prove when—there were none before that—yes there was one item that occurred between him and me—he gave me 60l —he lent me 60l in 1832—it was repaid by my father—I first saw Mr Robert Smith relating to my sister s money shortly after I came to London in 1808—I was away from London prior to 1838—I was at Tun bridge Wells several years—I had communication with him as to my sister s property not in Tunbridge Wells after I came to London in 1838—I was absent on several occasions between 1832 and 1838 at Tunbridge Wells principally—in the year 1838 I was directed both by my sister and father to make inquiries as to an investment for her principally by my sister—I mentioned to Mr Smith that my sister intended to come to London to reside here and that she had several monies she wished to have invested in town and wished to have his advice as to the best mode of investing them especially in reference to government securities—he replied that he himself would be her banker as my sister and her father knew his opulence and his wealth and his safety —that is what be said and he would give her more for the monies than government—he recommended at the same time that a rentcharge should be purchased for her on some property in London and he promised to look out carefully for a suitable rent-charge and such monies as she deposited in his hands would be immediately forthcoming when such a rentcharge was found—I communicated the matter to my sister—she assented to the proposal and the monies were then almost immediately forthcoming and shortly very shortly afterwards the monies came gradually—I paid monies to him from her—an account was kept of that both by myself and Mr Robert Smith—this is the account book I had—in 1838 Nov 5th 550l was advanced—1839 Aug 1st 450l —1840 June 1st 1200l —1841 Jan 10th 500l and on Aug 12th 1841 175l —the 175l was the last that consisted of a small sum of money I paid into his hands and a further sum as interest which he paid me and which I refunded to him—32l 7s 2d was cash and 142l 12s 10d the interest—that I paid back to him to be considered as principal—that makes up a sum of 2 875l altogether— looking at the I O U the morning this was executed I saw Mr Smith at my own house—it was the 12th of Aug 1841—that was the day I paid the 175l —we had a settlement according to this memorandum book—he signed the settlement—he kept a book—I am aware that corresponding entries were made in his book—I saw them and his book is similarly signed—when this settlement took place he said my sister should hare a security—he said he would give my sister a written security—he expressed himself as being in a hurry then but said as there was service in chapel on that evening he would bring it to me there ready—I attended the chapel on that day and saw Smith—it was Thursday the 12th of Aug —I saw him in my vestry—he came into the vestry and gave me this saying that he had written an acknowledgment for my sister s money—being disappointed as to the nature of the security I made some objection to it to the omission of the interest at 4 per cent as arranged that morning and I think I also mentioned I expected there would have been a bond—he then expressed some anger at any doubt being cast upon him—this is not on a stamp—I think I also mentioned that there was no stamp—it all occurred in five minutes time before the service consequently it was hurried—he also added that from my personal knowledge of the whole transaction no written security was necessary—he said it would give validity to it if the gentleman the clergyman who was present and myself would put our names to it—that was Mr Nickson—Mr Nickson was there on duty—he preached for me that evening—he attested it at Mr Smith s request—we both attached our names—these are our signatures—this is his and this is mine— pointing to them —I saw Mr Robert Smith two or three times after that—the first time as a friend in London advised me them I urged upon him to give a bond—that was in about a week or a few days after—I personally saw him—he did not seem to like my request for the bond—he would not give a direct negative—he said be would give as he had done before a promissory note and he gave me this the note in question—he brought the stamp without any writing upon it to my house on the morning of the 9th of Sept —at his request I wrote the promissory note and the later passage at his own dictation—the latter passage is with 4 per cent interest thereon from the above-mentioned date for value received by me in cash advanced by her on loan to me at different periods as by settlement this day —I wrote those words at his dictation—he signed it in my presence—I asked him to have some other person present to sign it—he said he did not wish to divulge his affairs to the world and at his request I signed my name as a witness—a small balance of interest was paid then—the arrears of interest that was due on this I O U —I have a memorandum of the sum—it was 8l 9s 6d I again spoke to him about the bond—he said he would give a letter by which he would bind himself to give it if required—he was again in a hurry but said if I would write him a letter giving him instructions what to write he would certainly sign it—I wrote a letter this is it—it is entirely according to Mr Smith s instructions—I wrote a letter for him and sent it by the penny or twopenny post saying on the fly leaf that I had an engagement in that district in that part that evening and I would call on him about seven o clock—in the course of the evening I did call—he handed it to me at his door ready signed—I adverted to a mortgage but he said he would sooner throw up my sister s money altogether than be annoyed with mortgages Mr Robert Smith was not often in the habit of attending my chapel—he did occasionally—he was not a stated member of my congregation—I do not know the very day he died it was some time in Sept—Mr Nickson is dead—he died about the same period of time I cannot say to a day I think the latter end of Sept or the commencement of Oct —there is the attestation Cross-examination by SIR THOMAS WILDE Q Do I understand you Sir that this is the handwriting of Mr Smith besides the signature in this book or is it the signature only A Only the signature—there is no part of this note the handwriting of Mr Smith except the signature—the substance of this I O U the signature and the amount all except the attestation and We the undermentioned is his handwriting—the whole of the upper part is his handwriting—no part below that where I have doubled down is his writing—the body of this I O U is Mr Smith s writing that is he brought it to me as his writing—that at the bottom is my own and Mr Nickson s writing—the letter dated the 9th of Sept is all my handwriting except the signature—I sent it by the post and he gave it to me at his door—he had taken the post-mark off the fly-leaf himself—he gave it me so—I took my doctor s diploma in the July of last year—I have known Mr Smith about ten years—I was not very often at his house—he was chiefly at mine—he was several times very often at my house—I said I came to live in London in October but I remember it was rather earlier than that—in the preceding month in Sept 1838—Mr Smith kept no front shop no outward shop in the street no external shop—he lived at No 12 Great St Andrew-street Seven-dials—in appearance he was rather taller than myself—his hair nearly white rather bald emaciated and thin—I should say he was exceedingly mean in his appearance and dress—I should say he certainly was not gentleman-like in his dress—I should say he was rather mean—I cannot remember any person who ever saw me at his house besides me and my sisters—my servants have seen him at my house—I cannot mention many of their names because there are not many but there is one Caroline Laxton she has been in my service and has returned to it again—she was in my service about a year or better than a year ago—she came about a year and a half ago—she remained a few months—I cannot say exactly perhaps six months as nearly as I can speak to it—she is now with us—she returned I think about three months ago—since this cause has been in existence—I have understood she is here—I do not know from whom I got her character—I do not know those matters myself—it is Mrs Bailey attends to them—I have no doubt some competent person but I do not know—I do not know where she lived during the interval of her absence—I remember she lived with a barrister I forget his name—my acquaintance is not so extensive with barristers that I forget his name—he lives in one of the squares—I never saw him—you asked me where this person bad lived I beard from Mrs Bailey that she lived in a barrister s family—there is another person who saw us in company Mrs Grey a surgeon s lady who lives in the Borough I do not know what part exactly I think it is Henry-street—I do not know where—I know her she attends my chapel occasionally—she saw Mr Smith in the vestry of my chapel and she saw him at my chapel generally I believe—she has told me so some months ago—I understood her to say she knew him to speak to him—she knew who he was—she told me that some months ago—I did not make inquiry of her if she knew Mr Smith—she mentioned it in my family—I think it was to Mils Walker a member of my family Mrs Bailey s sister—Mrs Grey is here—I am not sure but I think she has said she has seen him at his house—Mr Smith was a very well-informed man—he was something in the iron-trade which I saw when I got into the house—I have been in the front room the parlour I suppose it is called—there is a parlour in front—I am very unobserving of furniture—I remember a glass front to a bookcase in the room indented in the wall—his first transaction with me was his lending me 60l —I do not know anything of his private affairs or of his habits—he was penurious—I cannot say whether such a man is in the habit of lending money—I do not remember whether I gave him any security—the 60l was for some purchases of books I had made—I do not think I did give him any security it may have been an acknowledgment I cannot remember—I quite forget it—he lent me the whole in sovereigns—it was in my hotel where I then was the Blenheim-hotel in Bond-street—I was staying there alone I think about a fortnight—that was the first time I had staid at the Blenheimhotel—he gave it me there—he lent it me there—my father I understood repaid him immediately afterwards a few days afterwards—this was ten years ago—I called on him again when I came to reside in London in the year 1858—I brought a letter of introduction in 1832—I did not deliver that to him at his house—I think I inclosed it to him saying I would call at a certain hour the next day which I did—it was six yean after that visit that I asked his advice about my sister s money—it was a very few days after I came to town in 1838—my sister was then in Ireland in Belfast—her money was in Ireland—he recommended that I should invest it in a rentcharge it was at that time he told me that in the meantime he would take the money and allow me more than the government—I know nothing about what the funds yielded then—I made no comparison—the first advance was Nov 5th 1838—my sister remitted the money to me through my father—I gave it to Mr Smith—I got it from my father as the channel of conveyance of it—the 550l I advanced on Nov 5th 1838 I received from the hands of my father—he was then living at Belfast—he inclosed it to me in a letter—I received it by a remittance—it was in Bank-notes generally I think Bank of Ireland—I took no memorandum of them whatever—I have not got the letter covering the remittance—I did not take any particulars of what the notes were which I delivered to Mr Smith—not of how much were Bank of England and how much were Bank of Ireland or the amounts no particulars whatever—I handed Mr Smith over the identical notes precisely as I received them—he adverted to various family things at the time I cannot remember them—he spoke of his high respect for my father his knowledge of him and so forth—I forget what memorandum or security I took in 1838 for the 550l except by reference to my memorandum-book—I want the memorandum book and I O U —that was delivered up to the late Mr Smith on the 23rd of Dec 1889—I received the interest on the sum which I have already stated before the next transaction occurred—the first entry was made in this book on Nov 5th 1888—this book was begun at the time—the entries were made at the time they purport to bear date—the acknowledgment I took from Smith for the advance of 550l on Nov 5th 1888 was an I O U —on the 23rd of Dec 1889 he had paid all arrears of interest—there was no interest between Dec 1839 and Aug —not between Nov 5th and Aug 12th—I received interest on the 28rd of Deo 1839 and on the 1st of Aug 1839 I gave him the further sum of 450l —I got that in the same manner—a remittance by my father to me by Bank-notes—generally all the monies were Irish sometimes there were English notes among them—the entries in the book were made from time to time according to the date they bear—they were generally Irish Bank-notes but some English Bank-notes and I always handed over the particular monies I received—I took no particulars at the time any more than the former—the voucher I took on that occasion is expressed in the book an I O U —my sister was in Ireland at the time—this is my writing with the exception of the signatures—it is In an agreement this day Mr Smith gives Miss Bailey his note on demand for the above 1000l at 4 per cent and he also paid in cash to her up to this date 23rd Dec 39 —that is the only document—the note is not in existence—it was given up to him—that note was given up on the morning of the day on which I received the I O U from him—the I O U on the separate paper I think allow me to look at the book looking as it this note of 1000l mentioned in the memorandum to have been given on the 23rd of December 1839 was given up on the receipt—the date is the 12th of August 1841—the note was given on the 23rd of December 1839 and given up on the 12th of August 1841—I received the 32l interest from Mr Smith I have already adverted to—that is the only amount I have ever received from him—I think I gave him a voucher for that—it was his own book that I signed a book with a very few leaves evidently not a book that he used in his business a book specially for the purpose of my sister s account not a book of the same character and description as this—it was an 8vo or 12mo size bound in dirty leather—it contained no entries of other matters than those relating to my sister that I observed—I received the 32l interest at the date of that book in December 1839—I came to a settlement with him—the book was the only document between us that I know of—he then put both the I O U s there and the promissory note I think it expressed there—the words to her in this promissory note were interlined by me at the time—the arrears of interest were paid to me in cash—I showed him the letters that I had received from my father and sister in reference to this subject—I have not one of those letters now—I should observe that Mr Smith had had himself some conference with my father on the subject but I do not know what some correspondence I should say—Mr Smith corresponded with my father—his letters are not in existence that I am aware of—I think I should know his handwriting I am not sure I should be pretty sure of it—my recollection has always continued the same on the subject—the next transaction is 1st June 1840 that is To cash to Mr Smith on his note to pay 4 per cent interest 1200l —I got that money in the same way as the preceding a remittance from my father by letter partly by Irish and partly by English Bank notes—no particulars were taken—I always handed them to Mr Smith in my own house—all the money I advanced to him was in my own house—I think the book says the voucher I took for that sum was a promissory note— looking at the book —yes his note—another note for 1200l —that was handed up returned to Mr Smith the same day as the I O U of 1841 the last one was given—that was on the 12th of August 1841—I counted the Bank notes I handed to him—the Irish and English Bank notes I handed over to him precisely amounted to the sum I have mentioned—I never got one of the Irish notes changed and what proportion was English and what Irish I cannot tell—they came to me in halves by two remittances a half at each time—I pinned them together—I never put my name on the back of any of the notes—I never thought of it at all—I cannot tell you the amount of any one of the Irish notes forming the 1200l —they were all large sums—the general sum was a 100l note—the next transaction was on the 1st of January 1841 entered in the book in this way To cash to Mr Smith on his I O U to pay 4 per cent interest 500l —I had an I O U that was returned in the same way—we came to an adjustment on August the 12th—it took place at my house—my sister was at that time in Ireland—I met him a few days after that settlement as I was going in the direction of the British Museum—the date when we met specifically for business is given there according to this book the 9th of September—we had a settlement on the 12th of August 1841—we next met to transact business on the date of the promissory note the 9th of September—the settlement took place on the 12th of August at my house—I next saw him in the evening to get the I O U —we met in the vestry-room—the name of the friend in London who advised me to require a bond is Mr Payne he is now dead—I am sure of that—he was a private gentleman he lived in Jermyn-street—he resided there constantly for years —he died some time last August—he was not a professional man—he was a private friend of my own—I did not advise with any professional man about the security for these large sums for my sister—the promissory note was given at my own house in the morning and the I O U in the vestry in the evening at different dates as expressed in the documents themselves—I suggested that a more pleasing security should be given than an I O U and he consented to give the promissory note—the I O U was retained when the promissory note was given—I suppose that must have been through an inadvertency and besides that here is the letter of the 9th of September—no person was actually present in the room with me on any of the occasions when I paid any of this money though I have learned since there was one in an adjoining room—I cannot say there was any one present who saw me pay the money—I have adverted to a circumstance which I presume will come out in evidence that there was a person present in an adjoining room there being folding-doors so as to hear what passed—that was the maid-servant Laxton who I have spoken of—she heard what passed—she did not hear through the folding-doors—I believe they were open as 1 have expressed myself—she was in fact in the back part of the room which communicated by foldingdoors and they were open so that I should suppose she had a perfect opportunity of seeing all that patted—she said so—I was then living at No 7 Lower Grosvenor-place—it was in the back room I paid the money—she was in the front room—the sums I have mentioned were paid at my different residences—I saw Mr Smith a very few days before his death—I think ten days perhaps—I have a doubt of any person s handwriting except I acutually see them write but I cannot say I have ever felt any doubt in my own mind of Smith s handwriting—I applied to several persons after Mr Smith s death to see his handwriting one person I particularly remember a Mr Bealby—I borrowed papers of him in order to see Mr Smith s handwriting—perhaps I may have aaid to Mr Bealby that he was an illiterate man—I adverted to the rumours that were about him—I never told him I understood Mr Smith could not write his name not in so many words—upon my solemn oath I could not have said in any form of expression that I understood Mr Smith I could not write his name—I have not seen Mr Bealby in Court to-day—I did not say to him that I understood Mr Smith was an eccentric man who had left a large fortune that he was a very extraordinary man and could not write his own name nor to that effect—I have no recollection of expressing surprise on Mr Bealby telling me he could write his name for he had done business with him and had got his writing in his possession—I will positively swear I did not—I did not say to him in effect I should like to see his handwriting as a cariosity—I asked him purposely for his handwriting as I have in other instances—Mr Bealby at my request fetched down papers in his handwriting—I told him I wished to show them to a friend not as a curiosity but I think I said to test his signature—I did not say a word about having his handwriting—I hinted at having knowledge of Mr Smith and I said that a relation of mine had many transactions with him in a very general and superficial way—I asked him for the papers to show to a friend but not as a curiosity—I kept the paper that he lent me with the handwriting upon it a very few days perhaps two or three days—I did not Speak of Mr Smith as a person utterly unknown to me except as an eccentric character from public report—I kept the papers a very short time two or three days I should think it might be another day—I returned them immediately—this is one of the papers I borrowed of him with the signature—he showed me this other at least he showed me something like it—I cannot say it is the precise one I borrowed—I showed them to Miss Walker my sister-in-law and a Mr Brown a clergyman—he lived off Oxford-street in a street leading out of Oxford-street I cannot remember the name of the street—he was not a clergyman fixed in London he was staying for some time on a visit in town an old friend of my family to whom I mentioned all the circumstances—he is a clergyman without any office—I cannot tell where he is to be found—he is an Irish clergyman I think of the University of Dublin—perhaps he is in England perhaps at Cheltenham now—last January was the last time I saw him—it was at my own house—he is a person of independent fortune has no fixed residence and has not had for many years—he is not attached to the University except as an ordinary graduate—I do not know at the present time when is his residence except at Cheltenham—I have not seen him since last January—I have not corresponded with him—I showed him the paper in my own parlour and at the same time showed him these papers the documents of my sister—he recommended me to look at the writing in consequence of something particular he had observed in the documents themselves—it was in January I saw him last—I saw him on the 10th of Oct in the last year when that circumstance occurred of showing him the different documents—he recommended mended me to get some other handwriting because there was something particular in the documents if you must know it it was a discrepancy he observed in the signatures between the I O U and the memorandum—book I mean a discrepancy in the three signatures the signature of the I O U and the two signatures in this book—I was consulting with him on the matter what should be done—he asked to see the documents I then had in my possession—he himself remarked the discrepancy—he recommended me to go to several places and if possible to get what was certainly his real signature to see if he varied bis handwriting to get his acknowledged handwriting—I went to several people for it I do not think I can remember their names—very recently I have inquired of a Mr Gibbons of Mornington-crescent where his property is—at the time when my friend wanted to compare them I went into two or three shops as an urgent case to know if they had any commercial transactions with the late Mr Smith—I went in as a stranger to strangers—I remember I went into an iron-shop in Seven Dials but I cannot remember the name of any person I applied to further than that I did go into two or three shops at Mr Brown s suggestion—the person said he knew nothing about him and had nothing to do with him—I applied to Mr Gibbons of Mornington-crescent and through him to Mr Lewis—I am quite sure I got no other handwriting after the death than these documents—I got no specimens of Mr Smith s handwriting but from Mr Bealby—Mr Gibbons is a private gentleman in Mornington-crescent—he lives there now—I do not know who Mr Lewis is—I got Mr Gibbons to apply to Mr Lewis—I referred to him in the same way—I said to Mr Gibbons or rather to his family for I did not see himself that it was very desirable to have as many documents as possible—I got none from Mr Gibbons—his daughter applied to Mr Lewis—I know nothing of Mr Lewis except as Mr Gibbons s family mentioned him as a gentleman of high respectability—I cannot tell who he is except a private gentleman for I never saw him—he lives at No 12 I think Crescent-place is the name round the corner of Mornington-crescent—I applied to Mr Gibbons on that subject a few days ago—I have not personally made applications for specimens of his handwriting between the time of my application to Mr Bealby and my application to Mr Gibbons—the solicitor in the cause has—I always wrote to my father how I disposed of my sister s money lent to Smith—I have not one of the letters which I wrote to him stating such a transaction—my father died in June last year I am one of his executors—I did not see any of my letters to my father telling him I had lent Mr Smith my sister s money—my father left an immense mass of general correspondence but I did not see any among them connected with this affair—my sister was living in the same house with my father—the gentleman who advised me to get the handwriting when in London had apartments in an hotel in the neigbourhood of Oxford-street I do not know where exactly—I never called on him—I seldom called on clergymen who call on me in town for I should have nothing else to do—I have mentioned he was an old friend of the family—I did not call on him on the last visit certainly—I have called upon him at Webb s Hotel in Piccadilly but not the last time—I did not call on him at that hotel in January—it was somewhere in Oxford-street or its immediate neighbourhood where he was stopping in October—during all this I never thought of advising with any professional man at all as to the validity of my documents or as to the proper security to take for my sister—my sister has always been in Ireland with the exception of visits to England—I have no correspondence of my sister or any of the family in which I mentioned having lent money to Mr Smith—I wrote to my sister once about this matter about the matter being put into the present solicitor s hands—I think I have already observed that I did write to her about calling on Mr Smith and that the money was to be put into his hands—I cannot produce any such letter I wrote to my father my sister has either mislaid or destroyed the letter I wrote to her in Ireland—I have stated according to my note-book how much of the 175l I paid to Mr Smith in August—I paid him 32l 7s 2d in positive cash—the difference between 175l and 32l was the interest he paid me—he paid me in sovereigns at my own house—I think he had a purse—I did not observe—he paid them to me and I handed them back again—he counted them down to me—as my father was dead I got the money for that from my sister—when I was in Ireland she wished to have some little matters in London connected with her mourning and she gave me 50l in sovereigns—I cannot say that thirty-two of those identical sovereigns were paid over to Mr Smith for I had money of my own—I returned from Ireland on the 1st of August—I did not give my sister tiny voucher for that 50l —I cannot say that 1 wrote to her to tell her I had adjusted her concerns with Mr Smith and had got his note for 2 875l —I inclosed that promissory note in a letter to her but I think I hardly mentioned or adverted to the fact—I know I transmitted it to her—she has not got the letter that conveyed this note from England so as to show it existed at that time—that was one of the first posts after the 9th of Sept —I only sent her this note—I do not remember that she answered acknowledging the receipt except that she had received my letter of such a date—I have not that answer—she was writing to me almost every day about family matters and no doubt I was in my mind satisfied from her adverting to the receipt of a letter of such a date—I do not say literally I did not mention that I had sent it but I keep no copies of letters—it is very likely I said Inclosed is Mr Smith s note —very likely I did—my sister came to England in the latter end of January or the commencement of February in this present year—I wrote to her to return the note—that letter is not in existence—she inclosed it immediately—that letter is not in existence—I have looked carefully for all those letters but I could not find it—I looked for it immediately upon hearing of the death of Mr Smith it being necessary I conceived to demand the money—I think I got it back by return of post—I do not know whether Mr Smith kept large sums of money by him—he never adverted at all to his private affairs except that he generally spoke of his opulence his properties—I heard of the fact of Mr Smith s death I believe the next day—I did not read it in the newspaper—I was passing through that street and I noticed some persons at the door I was attracted by their manner and conversation went and stopped for a moment and they told me that the old man who had lived there was dead and I learned that he had died I think it was on the preceding day ox two days—it was the latter end of September last year—the late Miss Walker and my father knew Mr Smith and have seen me in his company—I have already mentioned one female who saw him at the chapel and the servant in my own house—those are the only persons that I remember Q Was the clerk there when you went to the vestry did the clerk see you A Oh that has brought it fresh to my memory—I forgot the woman of my chapel—the chapel woman saw him to know him—she saw him in my company—her name is Mrs Lee Re-examination by MR SERGEANT CHANNE L Q Now you have been asked certain questions with reference to an application you made to Mr Bealby A Yes I have told you every thing I can that passed between me and Mr Bealby—I cannot say when I first applied to him—I took no record of the fact at all—it was after the solicitor in the cause was instructed to proceed—I cannot remember the date some time I should say in the count of October—when I gave the solicitor instructions to proceed I placed the documents in his hands—I cannot say to a week how long after that I applied to Mr Bealby from my not taking any record of the date but I have a thorough recollection it was after the suit was commenced after the solicitor had been instructed—upon my father s death I went to Ireland and staid there with my sister two months in the same house—part of the time I was in Dublin—I had an opportunity of seeing her from day to day—she was my father s executrix—the other executor has not acted—my father left a great mass of correspondence of a general character—I saw that in various parts when I was in Belfast—I have had no means of looking over it since I left Belfast—I arrived in town on the 1st of August—I have not seen the correspondence since HENRY COX HIPPISLEY JUSTINS I am clerk to Mr Flower the attorney for the prosecution I was present at the trial before Lord Chief Justice Tindal when Dr Bailey was examined—this marked C is the I O U produced by Dr Bailey and this A is the promissory note he produced—this is the letter and book D and E produced at the trial JOHN BEALBY I live in Little Queen-street Holborn and am a builder I was acquainted with the late Robert Smith for thirty-five or thirty-six years—I remember his death—I buried him—I knew Dr Bailey before that—I had restored his chapel which was damaged by fire for the fire-office and became acquainted with him in that way—he called on me I cannot my what time but I am satisfied it was very soon after Smith s death—he introduced himself as far as I can remember relative to a little bill he owed me for work I had done at his own house—he then said You have heard of the miser s death in the paper —I said Yes I happened to bury bim —he said something to this effect Why the paper says he left 400 000l behind him and I believe he could not write his own name —I said Yes sir that is wrong for I had known him many years and I thought 40 000l nearer the mark I was surprised at the report in the paper and I said as to writing he could write as well as himself or me—I took a book off my table and showed him his writing in it for twenty years—I suppose it was a memorandum-book—the Dr went more fully into the character of Smith and I was disposed to give him an account of his character life and behaviour I said he was a very singular character that I was indebted to him between 4l and 5l and it was only a few days before he died that I paid him that when Mr Smith was indebted to me 200l I could not get the money but he said I should work it out and when the debt came that I owed him 4l 15s he applied for it—the prisoner said Have you got that document —I said Yes —I took it out of my cupboard and showed him the receipt and bill—these are them—he said it was a curiosity would I allow him to take it away —I allowed him to take them both away—he took them away and wished me good morning—this is the bill and receipt—it is made out to me—made out to wind up the account—the receipt is in Smith s handwriting—Dr Bailey kept them one or two days—I think they came back on the third day—I have known Smith thirty-six or thirty-seven years— looking at the promissory note —this is certainly not in Mr Smith s handwriting—the body of the note I will swear is not his handwriting and the signature I do not consider is his—I will not swear it is not his but I do not believe it is—I certainly do not believe this IO U to be Mr Smith s handwriting Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did you ever swear this conversation was three months after Smith s death A Never nor that I believed so—I never swore to time—I was asked about time but said on every occasion I could not swear to time—I have never said I thought it was about three months after the death of Mr Smith that the conversation took place—I never intended to swear any thing of the kind—I could not swear any thing of the kind—I never could recollect the time and my belief is I never swore it—I never intended to swear it—I am confident I never stated any period—it was put to me over and over again to say a date but I could not I never swore to a specified time—it never was my intention in any shape or way to give a time—I will neither swear it was or was not three months after—he said the papers stated the miser died worth 400 000l and he could not write his name—that I positively swear—he did not say 40 000l —my remark was 40 000l for knew his manner character and life—I will swear the amount the prisoner named was 400 000l —it was a long coversation of about three quarters of an hour—it is impossible for me to say all that took place—400 000l is the amount I will swear to—the 40 000l was my remark—I was startled at the amount he named—I will not swear I have not sworn he mentioned 40 000l but 400 000l is what I intended to convey—I cannot swear how long after Smith s death this conversation was—the impression in my mind is it was very soon after—I will not swear the signature to the promissory note is or is not Smith s writing but if this was brought to me as a cheque I would not pay it—I can say no more—I am not in the habit of having cheques handed to me but have very often seen his writing—the signature is very much like his writing indeed—the Rob I do not consider is as bis signature is usually signed—the Sm I think is very much like it—the whole of Rob appears to me not at all his signature—it is not like the character of his writing—I should say the R is certainly not formed as his the formation of the R and b aie stiffer—the Robert altogether does not appear his handwriting—it does not appear the same kind of letters—I cannot tell you the difference exactly but it does not appear the Robert of the deceased—it differs in every respect I consider—if that was taken away from Smith I should say it was not his signature at all—the Robert is altogether unlike bis writing—I should think every body would see it at once—I should certainly think the signature to the I O U is not his neither Robert nor Smith —I should consider them not at all like it in my shape or way whatever—it is not a good imitation—it is an imitation as for as the number of letters but in no other way—I do not consider either Robert or Smith are like his writing—it is some time since I saw Smith write but I have got his writing notes and orders from him—I cannot say when I had the last—the receipt was given six or eight weeks before his death—I did not see him sign it—my man went fox the money—I buried Smith in Oct MR HUMFREY Q You believe the receipt to be his handwriting A Yes —the man brought it to me—I am confident it is his writing—I have had it over and over again JAMES ROBERT BAKER I am a stock-broker I acted as the broker of the late Robert Smith the last ten years of his life—I made purchases of stock for him—at the time of his death he had stock to the amount of about 14 000l or 15 000l —I had many opportunities of seeing his writing and have seen him write— looking at the promissory-note —I cannot say much about the body of this—the signature is something like his but is not bold enough I should say—my belief is it is not his— looking at the I O U —I do not believe the signature to this to be at all like his Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Had you been in the habt of seeing Smith write during the latter part of his life A I have—the last time I should say was within about six months of his death—I should not say his hand had changed—it was always the same—I should say this receipt is his to the best of my belief Q Is not the signature to the promissory-note the more bold of the two signatures A I can only speak to the best of my belief—I think one is more round—I may not be a judge of boldness—I should say the receipt is most bold—I think the Robert and Smith in the promissory-note are one as like his as the other JOHN WALKER WILKINS I am a surveyor of pavements residing at No 26 Grove-street Camden-town I knew the late Robert Smith about seven years and was acquainted with his handwriting—I have seen him write—I do not believe the signature to the I O U to be his nor the signature to the promissory-note Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Look at the promissory-note and receipt should you think the receipt was signed by the deceased A They are very much alike—the receipt is like his and to the best of my belief it is his—there is a sufficient difference between that and the promissory-note for me to believe it is not the same—there is a stiffness a schoolboyness about the promissory-note more particularly in the two last parts of the m in Smith —I do not observe any particular stiffness in Robert —I have seen him write several times but not to have any of his writing except an agreement—I never saw what he wrote on any occasion but the agreement—I saw him execute an agreement in 1838 MR HUMFREY Q On what occasion have you seen him write A I have seen Mm write at his own house—I used to call weekly at his house for money and have seen him write and seen his writing which enabled me to form a belief of his handwriting WILLIAM IERON I am a carpenter and builder and have a shop in Alfred-mews Tottenham-court-road I knew the late Robert Smith and had transactions with him in business for about four years—I was acquainted with his handwriting—I do not believe the Robert Smith to this promissory-note to be his handwriting—I do not believe the signature or any part of the I O U to be his handwriting—I was present in the Common Pleas at the trial of the action of Bailey against Smith before Lord Chief Justice Tindal and heard Dr Bailey examined partly—I heard something stated about the 12th of Aug —I never knew till then that either of these documents were supposed to have been signed on the 12th of Aug —I heard Dr Bailey say something respecting the I O U being given on the 12th of Aug which is my wedding-day—I remembered on the evening of my wedding-day in the Aug before Smith s death seeing him about ten minutes before seven o clock in Stanhope-place Mornington-crescent Hampstead road—he was there with me to arrange certain works which were to be executed—I was doing carpenter s and joiner s work for him there—he remained there with me till about ten minutes to nine—I was in his company that night from ten minutes to seven till ten minutes to nine—I then accompanied him all the way down Hampstead-road to the King s Head where the omnibuses stand—he was going towards home—we parted as St Pancras clock struck nine—he was in my company till two minutes after nine—my foreman was there—I think the foreman left about half-past eight Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Look at this promissory-note is it like Mr Smith s handwriting A No—there is a resemblance—I should say more in the word Robert than Smith — Robert is not very like his—he did not make his R in this way—it is a very bad resemblance—he did not make them in this way but more round and wider strokes—a bolder and plainer hand—he did not shape his R s in this form—I very often saw him write and sign his name—my wife is not here—I believe the 12th of Aug was a fine day—I cannot recollect whether it had rained—there was none from ten minutes to seven till after nine—there bad not been a storm with thunder and lightning—I did not get wet through and change my clothes—I perfectly recollect that—I was out on business but did not take an umbrella that day—my foreman had been at work that day for Mr Elliott at two houses in Glo ster-road—I dined at home with my wife nobody else—the workmen had left the building at six—the foreman came there by my orders to meet me and Mr Smith to plan the work—I had seen my foreman at Elliott s at twelve o clock which is about half-a-mile from Stanhope-place—I went to Stanhope-place on purpose to meet Mr Smith—I had been in Rutland-place Hampstead-road where I was building—it was on Thursday—I have not looked at the almanac to see that—nobody told me it was Thursday—I recollect the day—I have not talked to the foreman about the day—my attention was first called to the 12th of Aug in the Court of Common Pleas on the 8th of July 1842—there was nobody else at Stanhope-place but a little man named Clark who was taking care of Mr Smith s houses about there—he is now on the premises—Smith and I were talking about the building and the staircase—we did not go to any public-house—we were not from the buildings and adjoining ground all the time—I did not notice anybody on the ground but Clark—I do not recollect meeting anybody in Hampstead-road—I should say it was dusk before I left the building so that we could not see a line which we were drawing on the boards to plan the staircase—Smith did not get into the omnibus—we did not shake hands on parting—we had no conversation in the foreman s presence but on business planning the staircases sashes and frames and the height of the principal part of the buildings—Smith and I differed about the plan of the staircase—the foreman was of my opinion—Smith gave in to our plan after a great deal of consultation—he was hard to be persuaded—we were differing about the staircase an hour and a quarter—I made the marks on the board—neither my foreman or Smith made any—the board lay on the floor of the front parlour—the sashes had not been fixed—there was no door to the house—it was quite open—the floor was not laid—I do not choose to say what was Smith s suggestion about the staircase MR HUMFREY Q Where were you married A At St George s Hanover-square—my wife s maiden name was Clara Basin EDWARD BYARD I am clerk to Mr Flower I examined the register of marriages at St George s Hanover-square on the 9th of July the second morning of the trial—this certificate is a correct copy of the register— This certifyed that on the 12th of Aug 1822 William Hieron was married to Clara Basin JOHN EDDY I am a carpenter and joiner and foreman to Mr Hieron I recollect meeting Mr Robert Smith at a house in Stanhope-place in 1841—it was in August and I judge it to be the 12th as my employer came and took me from a job to Mr Smith s job—I got to Stanhope-place from a quarter to seven to seven o clock—I remained with them an hour and half till half-past eight—I left them there—Mr Smith did not go away all the time I was there—I was with them most of the time till half-past eight Cross-examined by MR JONES Q Had you seen Mr Smith and you master together before that day A Yes several times before and after in the evening and morning—I did not make a memorandum of this meeting—I have since ascertained it was Thursday by the almanac—I looked to see what day the 12th of Aug was—nobody told me to look at the almanac—I looked a few days after I was last at Bow-street in December—I could not before that tell the day of the week—I swear I have not talked with Hieron respecting the day—I have talked with him about this affair only once and then it was trifling—I looked at the almanac at my own house—he was not with me—I did not show him the almanac—on the 12th of Aug Mr Smith and Hieron were talking principally about the staircase—we intended to carry the plan out different to the other house—Mr Smith held out several objections for a long time—I do not recollect what weather it was—I left Smith and Hieron on the premises—it was half-past eight o clock which was after my time and I thought they would not want any more of my services—I know it was not after seven o clock that I met them for Mr Smith said Mr Hieron never kept his word—he was rather behind his time—I did not look at my watch but I count by the time the men left work half-past six—they were making extra time—I do not believe that any body was on the premises but Smith Hieron and me—we went outside in the garden ground planting things—I do not recollect seeing any one there—I know Clark—I do not recollect seeing him there—he might be outside waiting to speak to Mr Smith but he was not with us—some of the sash-frames were put in at that time but not the glass—no doors were hung—the street-door was not up Q When was your attention called to this particular day after it passed A The evening before I was called to the Court—I was not asked about it till after Mr Smith s death—I attended the trial on the 9th of July JAMES SMITH I am the brother of the late Robert Smith He resided at No 12 Great St Andrew-street Seven Dials—he died in Sept 1841—I was first applied to about a promissory note in Oct —I do not believe the signature to this promissory note to be my brother s handwriting—I do not think the signature to this IO U is at all like his—I received this paper marked F or one like it from the witness Carney—I handed it to Mr Justins Mr Flower s clerk Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Were you and your brother much in communication together before his death A Very much—I saw him the day before he died—I was not at his death—he was not then in good health—I saw him at his own house in Great St Andrew-street in the front parlour—I think I spent the greater part of the day with him till towards evening when I had to return home—I dined with him that day in the parlour—I have seen this promissory note before—I saw it at Mr Hill s office and I pronounced it to be a forgery and so I do now—it is decidedly like my brother s writing—it is decidedly an imitation of it—it is pretty much like the writing certainly—it is a good imitation I should say—I cannot say whether a person less acquainted with him than myself would pay a bill upon it—I should say no—if I did not look critically at it 1 should suspect it—I should certainly say it is a pretty good imitation of his writing but it wants the freedom which was peculiar to my brother s writing Q What is the name of the gentleman who is coming to tell us that it has been traced A I do not know—I have no knowledge of the gentleman—I heard him examined at Bow-street—I do not think I ever beard his name but once and I do not recollect it—I should say the R is shaped pretty much as my brother shaped his—I cannot exactly point out the difference without I had another name to compare with it—I should say it is very stiff writing—it is not written with that freedom which characterised my brother s writing—I think the letters are very much after the same as my brother s writing—I think it is a very good imitation Q Now of the two which word is most like the word Robert or the word Smith A If you want me to enter into discrimination with re-gard to the letters I should say the letter m in the Smith detects the forgery—it does not possess that peculiar roundness that my brother s writing did—the m is very badly done—I should say it is a very bad m altogether—I cannot say as to its being different in form but it is a very much worse m than my brother generally made—it has not that bold round character—it is not quite so round Q Is it palpably so A I really do not exactly know what you mean by palpably —I have been a schoolmaster—I do not understand what you mean by palpably in relation to this—the general acceptance of the word is feasibly I should say—the signature has a stiffness of character through the whole of it which is not at all peculiar to my brother s writing—I am speaking of the whole character of the signature—the stiffness is the principal thing I speak to—I do not know anything else—this receipt is his hand writing—that I detect at once—there is more freedom in this and you will particularly observe with regard to the m that there is more roundness—the signature to this receipt is decidedly bolder than the signature to the promissory note—there is more roundness and freedom of turn—I have not got any more of my brother s handwriting with me nor caused any to be brought—I have plenty at home—my brother died without a will—I am the sole next of kin—I am his own brother therefore I am the next of kin and he has a sister—if Dr Bailey had succeeded in the action at Guildhall I should We been 3000l the worse—my sister is not here—I have several other relations living in London—one of them is here Mr Brown—I have nine relations living in London besides my sister—my sister lives in ray house—I have a wife but no children—my family consists of my wife my sister and two servants—the greater part of my relations live in Mornington-place and a portion of them in Russell-street—all the family are I believe on the most friendly terms at least I have no other feeling towards any branch of my family but of the most friendly kind and that was so with my brother in his lifetime—he dined at my house the Sunday before his death—all the family were on good terms friendly and visiting each other—I am the prosecutor of this indictment MR HUMFREY Q Is your sister in a fit state to be brought as a witness A By no means I am sorry to say—I never heard or knew of any intimacy existing between my brother or any part of my family and Dr Bailey and his sister—I never in my life heard his name mentioned until the subject of the note was brought forward or his sister or any relation BRYAN CARNEY I know Dr Bailey—I first spoke to him when he came up to me in the Brompton-road—I have been a mason s labourer a long time then getting old I took to selling fruit and I was selling fruit at the corner of Brompton when Dr Bailey came to me—I had never seen him till he came up to me there—I did not take notice when it was but as far as my judgment goes it was about the 1st of October last—he at first said It is a fine day —I said Yes —he said How do you get on with your work —I said as well as I could but not so well as I wished—he asked how I was situated—I said I had a large family and the eldest helped the youngest—he said Have you been long in London —I said Between nineteen and twenty years —he said Are you in any way experienced in a law-suit —I said No I am not I never liked it or any one that was given to it —he said What made me ask I had a law-suit in hand three months ago and I was defeated for want of one witness the opposite party had three witnesses I had hut two and so I was defeated will you become one —I looked at him and admired what he said and stopped for ten minutes—I said Yes to see what was his motive for asking me the question he never having seen me before—he put his hand into his pocket gave me a shilling told me to call at his house the following day at ten o clock at Caroline-street Coleshill-street No 73—I called next morning and saw him in a room in his house—he began to tell me what I should do—he said Mr Smith s counsellor will attack you very close and do you know what to say —I said I do not know what to say —he said Well I will write it down for you can you read — I can read said I—he took a paper and pretended to be writing —whether he was writing or not I cannot say but he had a pen and ink over a paper—he was on the other side of the table—he read it for me and told me to read it myself which I did—he said Well take it home get it by heart —I should know the paper again which he gave me—this now produced is it F —no one but me saw it—I did not let friend or foe see it till I gave it to Mr Smith—Dr Bailey had taken down where I lived when I called at his house and four or five days after he called at my house and told me he wanted me to go down to St Mary Axe and he gave me a note to a solicitor of his—I took the note there and Dr Bailey came in five or six minutes after me—he told me every thing I was to tell his solicitor before I went there—I told his solicitor more than I can recollect now—I did not mind to keep it in my recollection since that there were a good many words in it which I did not think anything of—I remained with them as much as three quarters of an hour I believe Q How soon after this did you see Dr Bailey again A I cannot tell you to tell you the truth I only wanted to get rid of him and his business did not take the least effect on my mind—he called at my house twice and brought me up to Hyde-park-corner that I might not forget it—he talked to me about what I was to say—he called on me once when I was in bed—I think it was about half-past eight—I dressed and came down—I fonnd him in the house—he told me he wanted to speak to me outside—I went out—he said he particularly wanted me next day about eleven o clock at the Exchequer coffee-house—every time he called on me he gave me a shilling—he gave me a shilling and I did go to the Exchequer coffee-house and what I had said at St Mary Axe was all written down before me by another solicitor I believe he was—he asked me to read the paper—I told him to read it himself—he read it to me—I told him it was right—then they told me to go over with a young lad who was there through Westminster-hall before a Magistrate and my flesh crawled on my bones and I shook Q Well did you refuse to swear it A I did refuse I would not do it for a million of money—I could not do it—as far as my judgment is I received in all of him 7s 6d —he promised to give me 30l Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Your account then is for all you have done or pretended or agreed to do from the time you first saw Dr Bailey till now all you received was 7s 6d A That is all I received of him—I have received my wages of Mr Justins—I received 3s 6d the day Mr Justins called on me—I believe I was four days at Bow-street—it was three or four days and I was two days here—they paid me 3s 6d a day for that and that is all I received as far as my judgment goes and 2s they gave me the first time they met with me—that was for bringing me over to hit office to ask if what they heard of me was right or wrong—that was before Dr Bailey was taken—it was a good bit after I was at the Exchequer coffee-house before I opened my mind to my countrymen and told them—I think it was seventeen days—I have lodgers and my two boys work—I sold fruit after I was at the Exchequer coffee-house for about three weeks but not down to the present time—my wife was unwell and I and my family got assistance from the parish—all I have received since I was at the Exchequer coffee-house was 3s 6d a day for five or six days and 2s when I came over to Mr Flower s office and 1s more one day at Bow-street—as I had no money I asked Mr Smith for the price of a penny-loaf and half-a-pint of beer and he gave me 1s —that is all I have received of their money Q Did you ever happen to go to Mr Hill the attorney in Bury-street St Mary Axe and ask for money A I did not go on speculation to get money—I asked him for the price of half-a-pint of beer when I went on one occasion and he would not—I went there twice and it was the last time—it was not the night before I went to the Exchequer coffee-house—I do not know how long before it was—God bless you I did not notice Q You must answer the question A Well then I wont—I never asked him for money but that once Q Did you tell Mr Hill that you knew Mrs Lee the pew-opener at the prisoner s chapel A I did—Dr Bailey when he met me the first time told me not to lay the case open to any body and it would look better for me to call on Mrs Lee and inquire where Dr Bailey lived and I told Mr Hill I went to Mrs Lee to inquire Dr Bailey s address—I told him various facts relative to Mr Smith and Miss Bailey—I told him Dr Bailey would not listen to any thing I had to say—that is what he told me to say—he told me that without any written paper—I told Mr Hill I first heard of the law-suit in a public-house where some persons were drinking and that I heard them say the Smiths had got over the Irish lady and that they had got 10l by the job—I signed my name to a paper at the Exchequer coffee-house—I did not tell the person with whom I left the paper that I would go over to Westminster-hall to swear it but he told me to go over with the young lad to the Hall—I walked out with the lad and turned home—this must have been seven or eight days after I had been with Mr Hill but I did not take any dates—I do not mean to swear what time it was—I believe it was better than a week after I had asked for the pint of beer—I remember the paper being read over to me Q Did you say after it was read over It is most true most correct A I said that it was right and then put my name to it—when I was at Bow-street I made sure that Dr Bailey wrote the paper he gave me but though his character and what I hear of him I cannot be sure of any thing he took in hand but he bad the pen and ink over the paper and I made sure that was the paper and told the Magistrate it was his handwriting—it was what I got from him—I have been a merchant before I came to this country—I used to travel with tobacco and whiskey in Ireland—I never got into trouble about tobacco or whiskey—I swear I never was before a Magistrate in all my born days only one time when I was tipsy—I was a mason s labourer in England four years ago—I left it off except occasionally but I worked for a Mr Smith six months in Five-fields—I sometimes carried the hod and sometimes navigated for Mr M Intosh in the City and laying pipes down—that is sixteen years ago—when I got work within the last four years I did it—when I do not I do the best I can and sell fruit—I do any work I am able to do and could get plenty if I could run the ladder—I do not carry on any business in my own house—about three months ago my wife took to sell green-grocery at No 8 Princes-row but was obliged to give it up in about two months—she could not make a living of it—I have lived there three years next May—this time two years I was with Mr C Smith in the Five-fields making up plaster for liming hair—when I got work I did it—I never went on messages or as a porter—I was questioned before the Magistrate by the gentleman behind you—I did not d - - n his eyes—he asked me a question five times—I told him I had answered him five times—I will not swear I did not d - - n his eyes—if I did there was more people in the room than you to hear it MR HUMREY Q When you went to Mr Hill you told him you knew Mrs Lee the pew-opener and various things who told you to state that A Dr Bailey told me to tell Mr Hill those words and to keep memory of it the same as if I was to be a witness to every word—he told me to keep that in mind as I should be cross-questioned—he told me to say I first heard of the law-suit in a public-house—I told Mr Hill nothing but what he told me as far as my judgment goes—I swore before the Magistrate this was the paper Dr Bailey wrote marked F and I made sure it was by his having the pen and ink over it and telling me to sit down till he had written it and after he had done writing he gave me that paper and this little bit of paper with a direction on it to go to St Mary Axe with the paper it is reading Robert Smith No 12 Great St Andrew-street Sevendials RICHARD DIGGINS I am a coal-merchant and am acquainted with Dr Bailey s handwriting I do not know whether the direction on this small piece of paper is his handwriting—I have seen him write a good many times ROBERT LENNY I am fourteen years old and have known Dr Bailey about three years He sometimes employed me to write for him—this paper F is my writing—he employed me to write it at his house No 73 Coleshill-street Pimlico—he gave me a paper to copy it from—I think this paper G is what I copied from—I do not exactly remember when it was I think some time in Aug or the beginning of Sept last year NICHOLAS PEARCE I am an inspector of police I apprehended the prisoner on the 27th of Nov at No 73 Coleshill-street Pimlico—I searched his house and in a table-drawer in the back-parlour I found different papers which I have produced and this book—these are the papers—this G is one of them This paper was here read as follows — K—n—y— I saw the late Mr Robert Smith at Dr Bailey s chapel on the evening of the 12th of August 1841—Mr Smith was an ironmonger and lived in No 12 Great St Andrew-street Seven-dials—the chapel service began at seven and ended about a quarter-past eight—Mr Smith was just going into the chapel before me and he walked into the vestry—Mr Smith came out of the vestry just before the service began and after him came out one or two ladies and then in two or three minutes after came the two parsons—Dr Bailey read prayers and the other strange parson preached—Mr Smith and the one or two ladies went into the body of the chapel during the service but I could not see them from the free-seats where I sat—I saw Mr Smith on the stairs as the congregation was coming out but I took no notice of him afterwards whether he spoke to anybody or whether he walked home with anybody—I saw him a few days afterwards in the Park and had a chat with him—Dr Bailey was in Ireland in June and July of 1841—I never was in any room in Mr Smith s house but the front-parlour—the name of Smith was on the door on a brass-plate MR CLARKSON to MR JUSTINS Q Did you hear Sir Thomas Wilde state at the end of Dr Bailey s examination that be would bear of this in another Court A I do not recollect it MR TOLCHER I do not recollect it HENRY FLEMING I am a cabinet-maker and live in Terrace-court I have known Dr Bailey about two years and a half—I have been in the habit of doing little jobs for him—he called on me the first Sunday in last Sept —I was in bed—my wife came for me—when I came down I saw Dr Bailey—he wished to speak to me—I went out with him to the Wellington Cricket-ground Chelsea—he continued with me about an hour and said a great deal more than I can remember—he said his sister had been robbed out of money to the amount of 3 000l and it would be an act of justice for anybody to come forward and swear that—I unfortunately agreed so to do—I lent myself to it—he said he wished me to swear that I knew Mr Smith where he lived and so on that Smith was at his Dr Bailey s house in Coleshill-street Grosvenor-place—I did not know the late Mr Smith at all I never saw him in my life—the prisoner said he would give me 20l and my son 10l if I would swear I knew the party as a trial had been at Guildhall and he wanted an extra witness or two and then they should defeat the party and become victorious—he said I was to swear my son and me met Mr Smith the miser at Queen-square chapel and saw him come out about half-past seven o clock on the 12th of August that he had not time to speak to my son and me relative to a job he was to have given my son but that he went away to see Mrs Grey near York-gate and there we were to leave one another I and my son were to go one way and Mr Smith another—he said we were to swear this—unfortunately I condescended to swear it—he called at my house about three times—the second time was the next day—he called and left the Times newspaper relating to the first trial at Guildhall—he brought me the instructions in writing the second time—I destroyed that the day I saw Mrs Bailey after he was taken up—I kept it till then—he read every word of the paper over to me—I should know it if I heard it read NICHOLAS PEARCE re-examined I found this paper H in Dr Bailey s presence—he unlocked the drawer I found the paper in and saw me take it out— read F—l—ng— I have known for twenty years the late Mr Smith ironmonger 12 Great St Andrew-street Seven Dials—he died in Sept 1841—he was about seventy years old middle sized very thin very bald and grey hair and a very beggarly dirty-looking man—I have bought many things from him—before his death there was no front shop but since his death they have pat in a front shop—the hall door was painted a dirty brown—there was a long knocker like brass and a brass-plate just above it with the name Smith in black letters about two inches long—I never saw any servant there—he always opened the door himself—there was both a knocker and a bell—he kept his ironmongery in a room at the back of the front parlour but I never was in it but I have been often in the front parlour into which he brought any articles from the back room I asked to see—the front parlour was a very dirty looking room—there was an old carpet an old horse-hair sofa and some old-fashioned mahogany chairs and at the right hand of the fire-place a book-case with a glass door circular at top and fixed in the wall but there was no glass or piano in the room—on the morning of the 12th of August 1841 between ten and twelve o clock I met Mr Smith coming out at the corner of Coleshill-street and he saw me and called me to him and he asked me what I was doing and what my sons were about—I told him as I heard he was building houses at Mornington-crescent I would be greatly obliged to him if be would find some situation for my son—Mr Smith told me he was in Pimlico that morning with Dr Bailey in Coleshill-street upon which I asked him was the doctor getting iron-work done at his house—he answered No I have been with him settling some family accounts with him I have known the doctor s father for fifty years thousands of their money have passed through my hands —he also told me that the doctor had come into a large estate by his father s death—I answered I thought there must be something more than trade between Mr Smith and the doctor as I had seen them two or three times together in Grosvenor-place very friendly and intimate together—Mr Smith said he wished to see my son and 1 asked him when he would be in Pimlico again and he replied that he had made an appointment with Dr Bailey to go to his chapel in Queen-square that evening—I told him I would if possible bring my son there—I and my son did go but we were too late for service and we walked about till the congregation came out—there went about thirty or forty persons came out—we saw Mr Smith and talked to him for about one minute near the chapel door and I showed my son to him—Mr Smith said You may depend I will not forget it and you will soon hear from me —I did not hear from him according to promise and I called once at his house a few days afterwards but no one answered the door—Mr Smith seemed anxious to hurry away from us near the chapel door and he walked off hastily towards the Birdcage-walk and we took the opposite direction and returned home by York-street—my son and I particularly remember it was the 12th of August because &c &c &c HENRY FLEMING re-examined I am certain every word of that is the same as he gave it to me—there is not a word of truth in it from beginning to end—he gave me that paper on the second occasion Q It ends because &c did be see you a third time A Yet—he asked if I bad any thing on the subject of the date to fix it in any manner—I told him there was nothing to recollect the date whatever—I had various papers in a little box which he examined—he said he wished to examine then to find the 12th of Aug and it so happened I had a letter on the 11th of Ang to get my eye probed on the 12th of Aug some years before and he found that letter from the Ophthalmic Institution—he said that was the best thing be ever saw it would answer every purpose that it was the exact day of the month—he called at my house again in about a fortnight and desired me to go to the Exchequer coffee-house I think it is called close to Westminster-hall—I went to St Mary Axe twice by his direction before I went to the Exchequer coffee-house and was examined there by his solicitor—I met the doctor at the Exchequer coffee-house and his sister as I understood and Mrs Lee the servant Bryan Carney the witness and Mrs Bailey and three other persons I did not know—the depositions were read over there and I signed my name with various others—I went into the Hall and took my oath—when I went to Mr Hill s office 1 did not take the paper with me—I showed him this card from the Ophthalmic—Dr Bailey had promised me 20l —I sent him this letter looking at it by my son—I did not receive any money in return—I have received from him directly and indirectly 25s —my wife received the last money—I was not examined before the Magistrate— letter read Orpin-place Rev Sir —Pardon me sending to you as you said as little as I was seen at your house the better it is necessary that I should appear a little more respectable than my own circumstances will allow I have been so distressed this last season as to be obliged to part with all my clothes to appear before the lawyer I must have my things from the pawnbroker s they will take 1l 5s to get them if you can let me have as much in two ways it will further your case I am wishing to see a builder that live in the neighbourhood of St Giles s can give me some information respecting Smith I have no wish to have more than I can pay you again only as you observed to me the time I may wait in attending to business About the middle of Oct I have from Somerset House an order for 4l given me by my son from Malta and the principal point I have to make out is the 12th of Aug and about that time I received from him 3l that I think I can get at by going to a gentleman I knew at Kensington but I must go decent Rev Sir —I remain your most obedient humble servant —HEN FLEMING Thursday morning To Dr Bayley CHARLOTTE FLEMING I am the wife of Henry Fleming and know Dr Bailey—I have seen him at our house three or four times—the first time was the first Sunday in Sept —he called three times after that—my husband went out the first time with him and was absent an hour—he taw my husband the second time and remained in the house with him about three quarters of an hour—he saw him on three occasions and came once when he did not see him—Dr Bailey gave me a sovereign about a fortnight before he was in confinement Cross-examined by MR JONES Q How long bad you known Dr Bailey A I never saw him before the Sunday that he came—I am quite sure he never gave me any assistance before that to my knowledge—my husband was in distressed circumstances some time before that and was so then—I have not received assistance from various clergymen in the neighbourhood—ladies call from societies and give us a few tickets—I never had any clergyman call—I have had assistance from the parish—my husband followed a business till his eye was bad—he works now when he gets a job—he has sung at St Saviour s church—he has not sung at public-houses lately—he was in the habit of doing so for some months—not in the streets never—and never was paid for singing at public-houses—he did not receive presents from the company—I have been with him—he never received any thing but once that was from the landlord of the George George-street—I did not sing WILLIAM FLEMING I am the son of Henry Fleming I took a note from my father to Dr Bailey about the 15th of Sept and received an answer from Dr Bailey himself that he had not got his quarter s pay but as soon as he had Mr Fleming could have any thing he required—that was all that passed ROBERT BROWN I was related to the late Mr Smith and knew him well during his lifetime—I have examined his books to find whether there was any transaction between him and anybody named Bailey—there was not any—the books are not here—I do not believe the signature to this promissory-note to be his handwriting nor the I O U cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you think neither of them like his writing A There is some resemblance—it is a very great resemblance—I should say decidedly it is not his handwriting especially this promissory-note—that is the least like it The paper I produced by Pearce was here read as follows — G—y 50l C—l—ne 40l Cat—rne 10l M—s—n 10l K—n—y Irishman 10l Flemming 20l B—r—by 30l L chapel 7l MR JUSTINS re-examined A person named Grey was examined on the trial and Caroline Laxton both on the part of Miss Bailey—at the time of the examinations before the Magistrate I did not know of Fleming not till the last examination—I saw him late in the afternoon Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How did you become acquainted with him A Fancying this Fl—ng meant Fleming I got the police to search the neighbourhood for a man of that name—I should say Queen-square chapel is near three miles from Mornington-crescent if not quite so NICHOLAS PEARCE re-examined I should say it is near three miles The I

Eaton-square — I received this morning a promissory note from Mr Robt Smith for Miss Ann Bailey for the full amount of cash advanced by her to him viz 2 875l &c &c 9th Sept 41 Witnesses for the Defence SUSANNAH LEE I was pew-opener at Queen-square chapel when Dr Bailey was the minister—I did not know the late Mr Robert Smith personally—I saw a man come into the chapel on the 12th of August 1841 and ask for Dr Bailey—I showed him into the vestry and he went in—he did not tell me what his name was—a young woman also went into the vestry—I did not at that time know who she was—I now know it was Mrs Grey—the man I showed into the vestry was an elderly man in a dark coat—that is all that I can say of him—he was rather tallish and rather stooped to the best of my recollection Q Was he thin or stout A He was a middle-statured man—I cannot say what age he was—the Rev Mr Nickson was there—he was occasionally in the habit of officiating there—there was no one else in the vestry that I took notice of—Dr Bailey was there—there was no one there except thia elderly man Dr Bailey Mr Nickson and Mrs Grey—when they went into the vestry the door was shut—they remained there about ten minutes—there was pen and ink generally kept in the vestry—after they had been in the vestry about ten minutes the whole four came out—Dr Bailey went into the desk to read prayers—Mr Nickson went into the seat at the opposite part of the chapel and there sat until the hymn was given out—he then went into the vestry and got robed—I put Mrs Grey and the elderly man into the same pew together—they remained there during the service—I did not observe them go out after service was concluded—I had got my business to attend to Q Do you know Mr Bryan Carney A I saw him—he came to me to the best of my recollection on the 8th or 9th of Sept —not last year the year before 1840—let me recollect—no it was 1842—he came to me at my residence which is adjoining the chapel—he came and asked for me in the yard—I went down and he began to tell me a long tale that he had been in St Giles s and that he had heard the party of Mr Smith— Q Did he ask you for Dr Bailey s address A He did—I did not give it him as I did not know but what he came like most for charity—I never gave him the address afterwards—I referred him to the chapel-warden Cross-examined by MR HUMFREY Q Who is the chapel warden to whom you referred him A Mr Chibnal—I did not know Mrs Grey at the time she went into the vestry—she was a stranger to me—to the best of my recollection that was the first time I had seen her and to the best of my recollection that was the first time I had seen the elderly gentleman Q I suppose they could not be frequently at your chapel on a Thursday evening without your knowing them A There were several that used to come to and fro that I used to pay no attention to—I attend to the whole of the chapel—I never remember having put them into the same seat before—if they had been in the habit of sitting in the same seat together a good many times I should have remarked it—I can say they had not been in the habit of sitting in the same seat as much as a dozen or half-a-dozen times they could not—the chapel is not very full of a week evening—there was very few that evening—there might not be above a dozen people MR JONES Q Could persons come to the chapel occasionally as many as twenty times without your taking particular notice of them A No they could not—I am the only pew-opener—I cannot say how many persons the chapel is capable of holding it may hold 300 for aught I know—persons would not come in and take seats without my putting them in—there are some free seats which go from the top of the stairs just round the corner—persons could go and sit in the free seats without my showing them there COURT Q What makes you remember this was the 12th of Aug A It was the last Thursday evening that we had evening service and the second Thursday in Aug WILLIAM CHIBNAL I know the prisoner I

evening—I saw an elderly gentleman there—I was going into the vestry the pew-opener told me a person was in the vestry with Dr Bailey and I did not go in COURT Q Did you see him as he came out A I did not wait till the congregation came out MR WILDE Q Do you know a person of the name of Carney A I have seen him—he never came to me to ask the prisoner s address—I have known Dr Bailey about four years—since I have known him his character has been very correct in every shape whatever as far as I have known—he has been quite eorrect in his money transactions and in his general character—I never saw any thing otherwise Cross-examined by MR HUMPHERY Q Was it after the service that the Pew-opener spoke to you A No before when I went into the chapel—I did not wait till the congregation came out as I had received a note from the Rev Mr Nickson stating that he would take supper with me that evening and I went home to receive him—this is the note— producing it MR JONES Q Did Mr Nickson preach there that evening A He did—I know Mr Nickson s handwriting—I have a letter which I received from him— looking at the I O U —I believe this name William Nickson M A to be the late Mr Nickson s writing ELLEN GREY I am a married woman my husband is a surgeon—I have known Dr Bailey between two and three years—I have been in the habit of going to his house—I am acquainted with Mrs Bailey—I know Queen-square chapel where Dr Bailey officiated—I have attended service at that chapel in the course of the year 1841—I attended there several times in Aug —I knew the late Mr Robert Smith I saw him attending the chapel several times—I was in the vestry-room of the chapel on the 12th of Aug in the evening part before the service—I saw Mr Smith there that evening—the Rev Mr Nickson was in the vestry at the same time and Dr Bailey—I saw Dr Bailey read over a paper which Mr Smith gave him—I should think it was a paper similar to this— looking at the IOU —Dr Bailey read it to himself—he made some objection to something in the paper but what I cannot say—Mr Smith said to make it all right Mr Nickson and Dr Bailey had better sign their names to this paper—and Dr Bailey and Mr Nickson both signed the paper Q I do not know whether you actually saw the signatures or merely saw them write on it A I only saw them write on it—after that was done I left the vestry and went into a pew of the chapel—Mr Smith came out about a minute after me and came into the same pew—Dr Bailey read prayers that evening and Mr Nickson preached—Mr Smith and myself remained during the whole of the service—after the service was over I left the chapel and Mr Smith overtook me at the Park-gates which part off the Birdcage-walk—when he overtook me we had some conversation together—I asked Mr Smith where the money was to be put—he said it was some monies that was sent over by Miss Bailey to be put into his hands and it was a good thing for her for if not she would fool it all away—I walked home to hit own door with him No 12 Great St Andrew-street Seven-dials—I then returned home—I did not enter his house that evening I parted from him Q Now on any other occasion than that did you see Mr Smith A I saw him in the July before at the chapel and at his own house—I had seen him several times at the chapel—I went into his house once as he was going to lend me a book of sermons—he did not do so he did not lend me anything—I staid there about three or four minutes—I went into the front parlour—Mr Smith was a middle-sized very dirty-looking man very pale and thin—I should think he was between sixty and seventy years of age—I cannot say exactly Cross-examined by MR HUMFERY Q You say your husband is a surgeon A Yes—his residence was in Exeter—I cannot say where he is living at present because he is in the habit of travelling—I do not know with whom he is travelling now—I have been lately confined—it was in November—I was examined in the Court of Common Pleas in July Q Did you then say that your husband had been at home for two months and that previous to that he had been absent for nine months A I believe I said he had been home for two months and that he had been home for a month besides the nine months that he was away—he had been absent for nine months before the two months—he had been home more than that—he had been home for a month then he was away and then home for a month again Q Now be very cautious because your words were taken down did not you say that he had been home for two months and that before that two months he had been away for nine months A I know I said that he had been home for two months but I do not know exactly whether I said he had been home for the month before—I cannot swear I did not say that he had been home for two months and that for nine months before he was absent from England—I am now living in Blackfriars-road at No 5 Angel-place Q Under what name A Mrs Grey—I do not go by any other name—I go under no other name than Mrs Grey—I have never been called by the name of Hart since my examination at the trial that I swear—I have never been called by the name of Hart nor by any other name than Grey—I will not swear I have not—I have gone by the name which my husband wished—have I any right to state it —it was my husband s wish that I should go by another name—I am subpœnaed here by the name of Grey to answer anything concerning Dr Bailey and not anything concerning my private family affairs Q I want to know by what name you have been passing and living since I examined you in the Common Pleas in July A I do not think I have a right to answer—I have only gone by one other name—if his lordship says I must tell what that name is I will MR HUMFREY If you choose to decline it I will not press it Witness Then I decline it—I last saw my husband at the latter end of Dec last—I was living with him then—I do not know with whom he is travelling now—I cannot say where he is at present—he has no shop or house or any place of business—he never had—he is travelling somewhere about down in Devonshire—I had been in the habit of frequenting Dr Bailey s chapel about eighteen months before had seen Mr Smith at Dr Bailey s chapel several times—he and I generally sat in the same seat—I cannot say how often I have sat in the same seat with him—it might have been a dozen times—it might have been more—I do not know about its being the same seat that we sat in on this night—there are different seats for strangers—we sat in the same seat on that night—I usually sat in the same seat with him—the pew-opener has put me into the same seat the has put me into the same seat it might be more than a dozen times it night be less—I never gave the pew-opener anything and never saw Mr Smith give her anything—I think I was first acquainted with Mr Smith about the beginning of July 1841 Q Remember what you have said before did you not see him first of all in May A It must have been in May—I used to attend the chapel on a Thursday evening—I saw Mr Smith in May—I do not think I walked home with him in May—I do not exactly recollect what month it was that I walked home with him—the first time I walked home with him I did not know his name—he talked to me on religious subjects—I cannot tell you of any one who ever saw me with him—he asked me to walk home with him and I did—I did not go into his house on the first occasion I only walked to his house and then left him—he let himself in—I walked home with him again in July I think—that was when we had been attending chapel together—we sat in the same seat and got into conversation—I went into his house with him on the second occasion—I did not know his name then—I staid in the house about three or four minutes—I went in for a book of sermons which he was going to lend me—I did not get it—he could not find it—I do not recollect whether he asked me to sit down—he looked for the book in a book-case—he did not ask me to stay when he could not find it—I walked home with him again on the 12th of August—I did not know his name then oh yes I knew his name then—I had learnt it in the vestry that evening—until that evening I never knew his name or who he was—when he entered the vestry Mr Nickson was there—he shook hands with Mr Nickson and said How do you do Mr Nickson and Mr Nickson said How do you do Mr Smith Q Have you ever lived in Dr Bailey s family A I have for four or five months or more—I cannot say exactly—it was some time before the trial—I only lived in his family on one occasion—it was last Christmas twelve months 1841—I heard of Mr Smith s death—I did not hear exactly that Dr Bailey had made a claim on his property—I did not hear anything from Dr Bailey about it—I heard of Mr Smith s death at Dr Bailey s from Miss Walker his sister-in-law—it was the Christmas after the 12th of Aug that I went to live in Dr Bailey s family—I have not had any money from Dr Bailey—I never applied to him for money—I swear that or to Mrs Bailey—this letter looking at one is not my writing—it was not written to Dr Bailey by my direction—it was written by my direction to Miss Bailey Q On your oath have you not applied either to Dr or Miss Bailey for money A Not concerning anything of this trial MR JONES Q If you have made any application has it been otherwise than in writing A Only in writing MR HUMFREY Q Have you received do money either from Dr Mrs or Miss Bailey A From Miss Bailey I have my own money—I had let Miss Bailey have some money to keep for me about 4l or 5l —I let her have it at different times at the time

at Stoke Newington—I do not know whether she is alive—I have been living where I am now living about a month or six weeks—I came there from Euston-square not from Euston-square but from one of the streets leading out of the square Whittle-bury-street—I lived there about a month—I came there from Henry-street in the Borough—I lived in several places while I attended Dr Bailey s chapel—I had a mother—she was not in the habit of going with me to Dr Bailey s chapel—I went by myself sometimes and sometimes my sister went with me—she is not here—I do not know where she is at the present time—she may be at home for aught I know Q How frequently did you go to Dr Bailey s chapel while living in Henry-street A I generally went on a Sunday and in the week-days sometimes once a-week and sometimes once a fortnight—I know Caroline Laxton—she and I did not go together to the trial at the Common Pleas—we met at the Court-house—I have not seen her lately—I have not seen her since July the last day of the trial—my mother lives in Angel-place Black-friars-road—she has lived there the same time as I have about a month—she never lived in Dr Bailey s family not at any time Q How lately had you seen Dr Bailey before he was taken into custody A I think more than two months before—I heard about a fortnight ago of his being taken up—I am living with my mother now—we have not got lodgings—we have the house—we do not take lodgers—the house consists of three rooms a sitting-room and two bed-rooms—my brother lives in the house—he is a manufacturer of steel pens—his name is Pike—my sister also lives in the house and I have two children—nobody else lives in the house—we have a servant—her name is Lydia Wright—she did not come to us from Henry-street—she lived with us in Henry-street—I have been in the habit of seeing Dr Bailey write— looking at paper G —I believe this to be his handwriting—I cannot swear to this H it is much like his handwriting—I could not take on myself to say it was—I should not think it was—I do not believe the whole of this first sheet to be his handwriting—some of the letters on the second sheet are like his but I do not believe it to be his writing—I should think this third more not his—the fourth sheet I think is more his handwriting—I think that may be his—yes I think it is—I think this fourth sheet is—I do not think the fifth is nor the sixth— these six sheets marked H contained the statement headed Fl-ng MR JONES Q Is your husband a very young man A Yes—he has been in the habit of travelling about the country with invalid gentlemen and of being absent from home for some time without my knowing exactly the place he is at—he came home about a fortnight after I was confined and remained till December—I do not know whether he has gone on another journey of that sort—he has gone into the country—I am in the habit of hearing from him when he is away—my husband has a particular reason for my passing by another name on account of some debt—I know Miss Bailey the doctor s sister very well indeed—I lived in the family altogether five or six months—I cannot say exactly—it was during that time that I gave her this money to keep for me—she was there—I went there as an attendant and companion to Mrs Walker whose daughter was in an ill state of health and is since dead—I have got back some of the money from Miss Bailey—my husband was at home about the July before I was confined—he had been at home at short periods before that at different times four five or six months REV EDWARD SCOVELL I am a clergyman of the Established Church I was acquainted with the Rev Mr Nickson—I have constantly received letters and notes from him and am acquainted with his handwriting—I have seen him write— looking at the I O U —I have no doubt in my own mind that this signature is his writing but it certainly is not his usual style of writing inasmuch as it is written in a very tremulous hand but I should have no scruple in saying it was his writing but it is very much disguised—with all the tremulousness I should have no hesitation in saying it is his handwriting—I have known Dr Bailey four on five years—I always looked upon him as a man of considerable talent and he has given me no occasion to doubt his integrity—I never heard any thing in disparagement of his general moral character Cross-examined by MR HUMFREY Q Do you know Dr Bailey s handwriting A I have received notes from him but I am not able to speak to his handwriting—it is very often customary at churches to sign the name of the preacher in a book—I have never known an instance of a detached piece of paper being signed as an evidence of having preached MR JONES Q It is usual to keep such a book in a chapel or church A Very usual—it is not universal—the clergyman enters his own name REV PETER HALL I am a clergyman of the Church of England I knew the late Rev Mr Nickson and knew from him of his having occasionally performed duty at Queen-square chapel—I never saw him write—I have received several letters from him which I have acted upon as being his handwriting and by that means 1 have obtained a knowledge of his handwriting—the name of Nickson on this I O U I should quite think was written by Mr Nickson—I have had a slight acquaintance with Dr Bailey—I think it is about three years since I first saw him but my acquaintance has not extended beyond two or three interviews with him and I think I have once or twice had communications from him in writing—he has been known to me that period—I have lived very near him—I knew him as the minister of Queen-square chapel—he has occasionally preached in the chapel where I now officiate and his ministry was very highly valued there—I think he has borne the character of a moral upright man quite so Cross-examined by MR HUMFREY Q Did you attend at the trial at Guildhall A Yes—I heard the greater part of the witnesses examined—I heard the Bishop of Rochester and others examined on the part of Mr Smith Q Do I understand you to say that now after what you then heard you believe Dr Bailey to be a moral man A That was not the question I was asked—I do not say any thing of impressions left on my mind by that trial—down to that trial I thought him quite so—I should have had no hesitation in asking him to preach to my congregation any day—if I am to take that trial into question I should say there were unfavourable impressions left on my mind—I think his character as a moral upright man has been very much questioned MR JONES Q Have you ever heard anything against his character except in relation to the subject of this investigation A Never MR HUMFERY Q Do you know his handwriting A I do not not to state it SARAH BURBERRY I knew Mr Robert Smith the deceased—I saw him several times in Aug 1841—I remember seeing him on the 12th of Aug —I saw him at his own house in the morning—he asked me if I would go to the doctor s chapel in the evening and I said I would go—he said he was then going to transact business with the doctor concerning money of Miss Bailey s—I have heard Mr Smith say that he had large sums of money of Miss Bailey s in his possession—I have been in Mr Smith s house—when I have been there I have seen an account-book on his table—I have beard him say that that was where he kept an account of the money that he had of Miss Bailey s—I saw the book lying on the table—I did not have it in my hand—I saw that it contained figures Cross-examined by MR HUMFREY Q Where do you live A In Star-street which leads out of the Edgeware-road—I have lived where I do now about six weeks I moved there from another house in the same street No 19—I lived there I think about two months it might be more—before that I lived in Robert-street Davies-street which leads from Oxford-street—I lived there about nine months—before that I lived in the Harrow-road I do not know the number—it is at the corner of the Harrow-road and Paddington-green—I lived there about six months—I am a dress-maker Q How long have you known Dr Bailey A I have not known him personally long I have only been in the habit of attending his chapel—I have known him from seeing him at Queen-square chapel—I knew Mr Smith a very long time several years ten or twelve years—my father knew him Q For the last five years Mr Smith was in the habit of regularly calling on you once a week every Friday was he not — examining the witness from paper marked J one of those found by Pearce at the prisoner s house A No he was not so often as that—I do not think I ever told any body that he was—I do not think I ever told Dr Bailey or any one else so—he did not call so often as that—I never mentioned that he called on me regularly every Friday—I have heard him say that Dr Bailey was the son of one of the oldest and most respected friends he had in the world—it was in consequence of Mr Smith s recommendation that I went to Dr Bailey s chapel Q First of all you went to his chapel four or five times of a Thursday evening only A Yes—the first time I went I called for Mr Smith and went with him Q Just look at that paper J tell me when you first saw it A I never saw it—the first time I went to the chapel I called for Mr Smith and accompanied him and sat in the same pew—about three years ago Mr Smith told me that he was managing Miss Bailey s property for her—he said he had Miss Bailey s affairs in his hands and spoke of her as having a great deal of money—when I called on him on the 12th of Aug it was quite by accident—I saw a paper on his table which was not quite dry—I did not read it—he did not put it into my hands saying Read that —I am sure of that Q Did he not say to you Read that and see what confidence a lady that I never saw in my life puts in me A He said that he bad never seen Miss Bailey—I do not recollect his saying Read that and see what confidence a lady that I never saw puts in me or any thing of the sort—he advised me to be as saving as Miss Bailey—he did not add and then I should soon get as much money of my own—he did not say he was obliging Miss Bailey much more than himself by taking charge of her money and that neither she nor her father would ever have had a farthing only for him—I did not read the paper Q Was it not an acknowledgment for 2800l odd A I do not know whit it was—he told me that he had money of Miss Bailey s in his possession I cannot tell the sum—he said he had been to Dr Bailey in the mornning and had made an appointment to be at his chapel that evening—he told me he was going there on business concerning the money—he told me he wished particularly to go to the chapel because the doctor in the morning had told him that that evening was to be the last Thursday evening service and he jokingly remarked that the doctor had lately got a large property by his father s death and was getting tired of preaching—I went to the chapel that evening but I was a little late—I did not see Mr Smith and the clergyman that preached sitting in the same pew in tht middle of the chapel—they were not in the middle of the chapel it was a side-pew by the pulpit—Mr Smith a lady and the clergyman were in the same pew at one side by the pulpit—there was only one lady—there were not just two ladies —I was not to say that I was sure there were just two ladies—Dr Bailey only read prayers—he was expected to preach—I felt very much disappointed that he did not preach—I did not wait to speak to Mr Smith because I thought he was engaged Q Did not Mr Smith as usual call on you on Friday Sept 9th 1841 in the evening A Yes he said he was going to see Dr Bailey and was obliged to hurry away—I was not well acquainted with Mr Smith s writing—I never told Dr Bailey that I was—I could not wear to his writing I do not know that I ever saw it—to the best of my belief I never saw Mr Smith s writing MR JONES Q Had you ever any business with him that required that you should see his writing A No—I was not called as a witness on the trial at the Court of Common Pleas—since that time I hare stated what I knew of this transaction to Mr Hill Q And to Dr Bailey A Yes—I did not send him any statement in writing nor did he take down what I knew—I told him what I have stated to-day—I saw the account of the trial in the newspapers and I afterwards stated to Dr Bailey and Mr Hill what I knew Notice to produce the account-book referred to by thit witness was admitted by the prosecutor s Counsel CATHERINE GLANVILE I was in Dr Bailey s service—I went into his service on the 25th of April last—I was not in his service before that—I was in the habit of attending his chapel between two and three years before I went into his service—I was not a regular attendant I went occasionally I knew the late Mr Robert Smith—I have seen him at the chapel in the course of the year 1841—I saw him in August that year—the last time I saw him at the chapel was on Thursday the 12th of Aug about seven o clook in the evening before the service began—I saw him in the second pew from the pulpit—one person was in the pew with him—that was Mrs Grey—I know this was on the 12th of Aug because it was the last time I was there on a week-day—I was examined at Bow-street but nowhere else Cross-examined by MR HUMFREY Q You knew Mr Smith for many years A Yes—I now live at No 16 Strutton-ground—my mother does—I live at Dr Bailey s—I have been backwards and forwards there ever since the 25th of April last—he never applied to me to be a witness—I knew he had a trial after the trial was over but not before—I was living at Dr Bailey s at the time of the trial—Dr Bailey did not give me any paper in writing Q Well but I can read a good deal to you that you have got to say many persons pointed out Mr Smith to you as the rich old miser did they not referring to paper marked K A Yes—I often saw him at his own window and his own door—I have seen him two or three times at Queen-square chapel and I saw him at the chapel on the second Thursday in Aug —he sat in the second pew from the pulpit the minister s pew—there was one lady in the pew Q Recollect yourself was he not there with two ladies and the Rev Mr Nickson A I believe there were two I am not sure—after the prayers Mr Nickson left the pew for the vestry to put on his gown to preach—I did not get there till after service began—I remember particularly that it was the last Thursday in Aug for there was service only on two Thursdays after Dr Bailey returned from Ireland where he had been the whole of June and July—this was the last of the two Thursdays and the last Thursday evening on which there was service—I remember it was the minister s pew in which Mr Smith sat for I wondered to see him in that pew at all—I had never noticed him in the minister s pew before—I left the chapel that evening among the first and could not see Mr Smith going out—Mr Nickson preached on both Thursday evenings after the doctor s return from Ireland—I remember this because I felt great disappointment at not hearing the doctor himself MR JONES Q How long did you continue in the doctor s service after the trial A I should have been in the service ever since but I left on account of illness and was obliged to go to the hospital—I returned again a month from this time—after the trial was over I spoke to Mrs Bailey about what I knew about Mr Smith—I did not speak to the doctor—he did not speak to me about it—I told Mrs Bailey all I knew about it—I believe the doctor knew I was in the habit of attending his chapel—I did not attend the chapel while I was in the doctor s service—Mrs Bailey did not write down what I told her—she did not write it down before me—I am not certain whether there were one or two ladies in the pew with Mr Smith—I am sure Mrs Grey was there and Mr Smith Q When you told what you knew to Mrs Bailey was anything said about applying for a new trial do you remember A No—I heard that there was to be a new trial—I knew that my evidence was wanted for that purpose—I was taken to Bow-street by Mr Flower the attorney for the prosecution as a witness for him—I was examined there—I was taken out of the hospital to the police-office REV FRANCIS BASSETT GRANT I am a clergyman of the Established Church I have known Dr Bailey for about four years—I never heard any other character of him than the most favourable—I had the most perfect confidence in his integrity and uprightness Cross-examined by MR HUMFREY Q Do you know his handwriting A Yes I think I do—I have no hesitation in saying that I think these papers are his handwriting J and K —I have some doubts about this I —it resembles his—the others I am perfectly clear about—this is very much like his writing—to the best of my belief it is his MR JONES Q You are not so certain about that A No ROBERT BROWNING I am office-keeper to the Commissioners for building New Churches I have known Dr Bailey since 1839—he lodged with me twelve months and during that time and subsequently he has borne the best of characters possible Cross-examined Q Did you ever see Mr Smith the rich miser in your house while he lodged with you A No certainly not MR JONES Q Did you know anything of him A No—I reside in George-street and my house is in Bridge-street—Dr Bailey did not lodge in the house where I lived but in another house where my family lived Rev Richard Hodgson Rev —Barber Jobn Elliott bookseller Mortimer-street Cavendish-square Edmund Dawe map-mounter No 6 Catherine-street Queen-square Westminster Patrick Townsend Lightfoot

thirty years—for the last five years he regularly called once a-week every Friday to see my mother—about three years ago he first mentioned the Rev Mr Bailey to us for he highly recommended his ministry to us and told us he was the son of one of hit oldest and moat respected friends in the world —in consequence of Mr Smith s recommendation I did go to his chapel in Queen-square four or five times on Thursday evenings only and the first time I went I called for Mr Smith and accompanied him and sat in the same pew with him—Mr Smith about three yean ago told us he was managing Miss Bailey s property for her and he spoke of her as having a great deal of money—I happened to call on Mr Smith the 12th of August 1841 in the middle of the day and he had just written a paper which was not quite dry and he put it into my hands to read saying Read that and see what confidence a lady that never saw me puts in me and he advised me to be as saving as Miss Bailey and I should soon get as much of my own—he also said he was obliging Miss Bailey much more than himself by taking charge of Miss Bailey s money and that neither she nor her father would ever have had a farthing only for him—I read the said paper and it was an acknowledgment of 2 800l and some odd pounds which Mr Smith acknowledged he owed to Miss Baileys—he said that he had been at Dr Bailey s house in the morning and had made an appointment to be at his chapel that evening to give him the said acknowlegement and he wished me to go to the chapel because the doctor in the morning had told him that that evening was to be the last Thursday evening service and at the same time he jokingly remarked The doctor has lately got a large property by his father s death and is getting tired of preaching —I consequently did go that evening but I Was a little late—I saw Mr Smith and the clergyman who preached sitting in the same pew in the middle of the chapel with two ladies—I am sure there were just two ladies—Dr Bailey only read prayers—I felt much disappointed that Dr Bailey did not preach —I thought that Mr Smith was engaged and I did not wait to speak to him—Mr Smith as usual called on me on Friday the 9th of Sept 1841 in the evening but he was obliged to hurry away because he said that he expected Dr Bailey at the Seven-dials that evening by appointment concerning Miss Bailey s affairs and he also spoke of having seen the doctor that morning but I forget whether at Mr Smith s house or at Dr Bailey s house—I am well acquainted with his writing K Ca—h—rn— I have known Mr Smith of 12 Great St Andrew-street

prayers left the pew for the vestry to put on his gown to preach—I went to chapel after service began—I remember it was the second Thursday of Aug 1841 for there was service only on two Thursdays after Dr Bailey s return from Ireland where the doctor had been the whole of June and July and this was the last of the two Thursdays and this also was the last Thursday evening on which there was service—I remember it was the minister s pew in which Mr Smith sat for I wondered much to see him in that pew at all and I had never noticed him in the minister s pew before—as I left the chapel that

told him we could not give him change out of the draft as we knew nothing of Captain Lindsay—we referred and could find no order from him—the prisoner said he was going into Bishopsgate-street that he had several commissions to execute for Captain Lindsay and would get it changed—I told him if he left the draft with us we would send it to the bankers early next morning and he could then call for

about it till it was shown to me by the police— looking at a cheque-book produced by Layland —I do not remember ever having this book of cheques in my possession—it has not the same number as my cheques bear—The number on the cheque in question is A 725 —it is not my number—my number is in 5 s—I do not exactly know—in the first part of July 1842 I came out of the country—I did not about that time authorise anybody to get a book of blank cheques from Robarts and Curtis for me Prisoner Q Do you recollect paying me at the time I left did I ask for a cheque A I cannot say positively—you had

pocket—I think I lost it by accident FREDERICK SKERRATT I am in the employ of Mr John Parnett Boll a woollen-warehouseman in St Martin s-lane The prisoner has been in the habit of making purchases for ready money as a tailor—I did not know his address—we do not take the addresses of persons who buy for ready money—on the afternoon of the 8th of May he came to our shop with this bank post bill for 20l and wished to know if we could take it of him—I looked at it and found it was drawn to the order of William Pennell Esq and specially indorsed by him in favour of John Croker Pennell—I said This bill in its present state is useless to anybody it will be necessary for John Croker Pennell to put his name on the back of it before it can be taken —he said Very well I will get Mr Pennell to do so —he went away—he came at four o clock next afternoon and brought the same bill with him—he spoke to Dickens the foreman—shortly after this bill was sent to me by the cashier-it then bore the indorsement of John Croker Pennell as it appears now—at that time I had no knowledge of this instrument having been lost—I did not receive any intimation till the Saturday after it was due—I then saw an advertisement in the Times newspaper stating that this bill had been lost—it was paid by us into Smith and Payne s and returned to us the same day—in consequence of what I found on the note Coles 21 Great Smith-street I went to that address on the Saturday afternoon—I could not find the prisoner there—I saw the person who I believe keeps the house—she said he had never lived there—I have not seen the woman here—in consequence of further information on Wednesday the 17th of May I accompanied the police-sergeant Weston to the Warwick Arms at the corner of Gillingham-street Pimlico—I went with the constable into the parlour—I saw several people there and among others a person I believed at first sight to be Coles but at the time I went into the room he was sitting with his back to me—he put his hand over his face and remained so for a quarter of an hour—I could not catch sight of his face and was not positive of him—alter that he put both his hands over his face and remained so equally long—from a conversation going on in the room he was caused to laugh and in doing so he raised his face from his hands and immediately he did that I recognized him—I told the officer that was him—Weston left the room and went into the passage of the house—immediately he left the room the prisoner got up from the table and appeared to be doing the same—I immediately rose up opened the door and got out before him—when in the passage I said Mr Coles —he made no answer—I said Your name is Mr Coles —he said No it is not and he pushed by into the street—it was raining very fast at the time—he appeared as though he wished to make off—I told the officer he was the man—he said Are you positive it is him —I said I am —he said to him We want you respecting a bill you passed to Messrs Bull and Wilson for 20l with a forged indorsement —he said I know nothing about the bill —I said It is no use saying you know nothing about it because I am the person to whom you spoke at the time —he immediately said with a great deal of surprise Oh are you the person —I said Oh then you do know something about the bil —the policeman said Well then it has a forged indorsement of John Croker Pennell attached to it —he said I know nothing about it I saw Mr Pennell put his name on the back of it JOHN DICKENS I am foreman to Mr Bull On Tuesday the 9th of May about four o clock in the afternoon the prisoner came to the warehouse and wanted to look at woollen goods—I showed him some—he hought to the amount of 6l 6s 4d —after the bill was made out he tendered me a 20l Portsmouth branch-note—this is it it has my signature—he said it came direct from Portsmouth—I handed it to the cashier—he handed it to another clerk—at that time it had the name of John Croker Pennell on it—I requested the prisoner to put his name and address on it—I saw him do so—it was Joseph Coles 21 Great Smith-street—I saw our cashier give him the difference—I was not there the first time he came FREDERICK SKERRATT re-examined He spoke to Mr Bull first—I did not hear what passed between them—Mr Bull brought him into the counting-house to me—I did not hear him say that he wished to know whether he could safety take such an instrument as he was ignorant of such matters nor anything of the kind—Mr Bull is not here—I found that the prisoner was not know at Great Smith-street—the woman said she knew him but he did not live there—he was known there—it was a marine store shop kept by a Mrs Cannadine—I said to her Does Mr Coles live here —she said No —I said Do you know where he lives —she said No —I said I am surprised at that because this is the address Mr Coles has given as being his did he ever live here —she said No —I said Do you know him —she said Yes I know him and he has occasionally slept here with my brother —I said I wish to see him on particular business can you tell me where I can find him any house he is working at or any person in whose employ he is and she could not tell me GEORGE WESTON police-sergeant F 6 I took the prisoner outside the Warwick Arms public-house I went with Mr Skerratt—I heard him ask him whether his name was Coles—he said No —I looked at Mr Skerratt and said Is this the man you want —he said That is the man —I then told him I wanted him respecting the 20l bank post bill he passed to Messrs Bull and Wilson s the other day—he said he knew nothing at all about the bill—I then heard Mr Skerratt say It is no use saying that for I am the person you presented it to —I then told him I wanted him for the forged name of Pennell on the back of the bill—he said I saw Mr Pennell write it myself —I then took him into custody Cross-examined Q You were not in your uniform A I was not—I searched him and found a paper about him referring to the Court of Requests which is called an execution— the bank post bill was here read MR BODKIN called - - CANNADINE My husband is a plane and tool-maker we lives at No 21 Great Smith-street Westminster I have lived there twenty years and nine months—I have known the prisoner by name some years—I have known him two years—he has been carrying on the business of a tailor—he lived in my house and had a most excellent character COURT Q You keep a marine-store shop A No a broker s because our trade is bad—the prisoner has been on and off at our house up to the present period not always—he lived in my house at the very time in question—I did not deny him I only evaded the questions as he had failed in business and was in difficulties—he lived in Vincent s-square Westminster eighteen months or two years since and he has lived as foreman with a high tailor but the gentleman could not come to-day—I know he lived in the neighbourhood I do not know exactly where—I do not know how often he has slept at our house in the last six months—more than a week more than six or seven Richard Cannadine the husband of last witness John Parry tailor Westminster and James

WILKINS conducted the Prosecution JOHN GOODMAN I am a cattle salesman I was in Smith field-market on Friday the 9th of June and had five wether sheep for sale—the prisoner came and bargained for them—it is the custom if the sheep are not paid for at the close of the market they are generally locked up till they are paid for—the party purchasing them is expected to pay the money at the banker s where the sheep are entered—he is informed where that bank is—on paying the money for them into the bank he receives an order for the delivery of them—the prisoner has never paid me for the sheep—I had never seen him before that day to my recollection—at the close of the market the sheep not being paid for were locked up in Turner and Clark s yard—I came to town again on the Monday—I saw the prisoner again on the following Friday in the market—he bargained for seven sheep and five lambs—he did not pay for them—he was afterwards driving them away and I stopped him—in consequence of that I sent my man to inquire about the five sheep I had sold him the week before and from information I received I took him with me to Turner s yard and he was apprehended that day COURT Q Did you tell him

s yard at that time A Mr Goodman had taken him up and brought him there—he said I want you to come up the yard with me and he went with him—he asked him whether he had paid for the sheep and he said that would be all right—the order wai then produced and he said it was his writing—nobody had said before that that he had better tell the truth or confess to my knowledge EULALIA MARTHA CLARK I am the wife of Charles Ranspach Clarke On the 9th of June Burgess brought five sheep to my premises to he locked up in Mr Goodman s name—next day the prisoner came to our premises and said he had come for five sheep he had bought of Mr Goodman—I said he could not have them without an order—he went away and came again on the Monday about three or half-past three o clock in the afternoon—he did not produce an order then but asked for them and was again refused—he came again in about half an hour and produced this order which I put on the file—I gave him the sheep—I am quite certain this is the order—I told him he must pay for the locking up—he went away and brought Oliver and got the money from him to pay for the keep of the sheep—I then told my man to let him have the sheep—he drove them away—he came on the following Friday with Mr Goodman to my premises—the order was shown to him—no one told him it would be better to confess or speak the truth—he said he wrote the order

nothing of the prisoner—he said he wrote the order—Mr Goodman asked him where he got the order WILLIAM OLIVER I am a butcher and live in Turnmill-street Clerkenwell On Monday the 12th of June I met the prisoner promiscuously in Cow-cross—he said Mr Oliver will you let me kill five sheep at your place —I had seen him once before—it it usual to allow people to slaughter sheep—there is a regular sum paid for it—I gave him leave to do it—he said They are paid for will you lend me 2s to pay for the locking up —I went with him to the Rose and Crown Clark s yard to see if it was all right—we saw Mrs Clark—I lent him the 2s when I saw the sheep there—I believe he drove the sheep away—I afterwards went home and found him killing them at my premises—I got the entrails and paunches for allowing him to kill them Cross-examined Q Do you mean to represent that it is customary for butchers to permit their premises to be used for slaughtering sheep A Yes for the guts and paunches—several deal in that way—Mr Russell of Cow-cross for one—he killed them on the Monday about four o clock and took four away on the Tuesday—I was present when they were killed—the skins went to Mr Challis a skin

deceased formerly of Smith-street Chelsea and late of South-terrace Pimlico—a copy of an affidavit on the subject was filed at the Prero-gative-office—we send the original to the Stamp-office Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Were you present in the first instance at the Mansion-house when Mr Barber was taken A Yes—I believe Mr Barber on that occasion expressed a desire to enter upon the case immediately without the aid of counsel—I was present—I heard Mr Clarkson caution him that if he did so he might do himself a mischief—I do not exactly recollect Mr Barber saying that he would go on for he had nothing to fear—he said something to that effect GEORGE BENNETT I am a clerk in the Stamp-office I produce the original affidavit filed from the Prerogative-office at the Stamp-office—it is attached to a copy of the will of Ann Slack WILLIAM SMEE ESQ I am chief accountant of the Bank of England Referring to a book In the year 1829 there was standing in the books of the Bank in the name of Ann Slack of Smith-street Chelsea spinster 6 629l 17s in the reduced Three per Cent Annuities and 3 500l in the Three per Cent Consols—they were both purchased on the 23rd of Oct 1829 and the dividends on them were paid under virtue of a power of attorney granted to Arderne Hulme gentleman of Hampden-wick Middlesex—the Reduced power is dated 13th March 1830 and that for the Consols on the 5th of Jan 1830—the dividends on the Consols were received by Arderne Hulme up to the 6th of Jan 1832—I knew Mr Hulme in his life-time—I do not know that he was a partner in the house of Jones Lloyd and Co —I only recollect his person—in consequence of the non-receipt of any dividends from the 5th of July 1832 the sum of 3 500l consols was transferred to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt on the 6th of July 1842 Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Are you acquainted with the manner in which parties generally speaking are identified who come to receive money from the Bank A I am—the ordinary course is that a party comes with his attorney and they send for a broker to identify him—all that is written on the document is known to me and the signature of the party Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q Are there not books published by authority of the unclaimed dividends A There are published by the Bank MR ERLE Q That is the name and description of the persons A Yes—it does not contain the amount of stock—it contains the period when the first dividend became due MR GREAVES Q Does it not also contain the number of dividends unpaid A Yes up to a certain date JOHN SLACK Esq I reside at Abbotts Langley Hertfordshire I knew the late Arderne Hulme My father s name was George Slack—he did not leave considerable property—Mr Hulme acted as the surviving executor of my father s estate and guardian to myself and sisters—he died in July 1832 he continued to act up to the time of his death not for me but for my sister—this paper is Mr Hulme s handwriting— this announced the purchase of the stock Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Has your sister any income besides that resulting from funded property A She has she has money out on mortgage—I should say her income was handsome—it is more than 500l a year independent of the 3500l consols—I do not know that I am bound to answer whether she is an intelligent lady COURT Q Probably not very much accustomed to business A Certainly not MR CLARKSON Q Can you tell about her age in 1842 A Yes she was of mature age—my eldest child was fourteen years of age last February GEORGE BEAMAN I am a surgeon and live in King-street Coventgarden—I am the executor of the late Arderne Hulme Esq —I produce from among his papers his books of account with reference to the family of the Slacks—it commences in 1828 and the last entry made by Mr Hulme is on the 7th of May 1832—on the 15th of Oct 1832 there is a settlement of account between Mr Hulme and Miss Slack balanced and signed by her—he charges himself with the receipt of the dividends on this 3500l from Jan 1830 down to Jan 1832 on account of Miss Slack and also of 6629l Reduced MISS ANN SLACK I reside with my brother-in-law Capt Foskett at Abbotts Langley—Mr Hulme at one time acted as guardian for me and received my dividends—after his death I received my dividends myself—I was not aware that I had a sum of 3500l in the Three per cent Consolidated Annuities—I did not receive any dividend upon that sum until after this inquiry had begun—in 1829 I was living in Smith-street Chelsea with Mrs Leek—she was no relation of mine—I resided there and paid for my board and lodging—I left Mrs Leek s in 1830 and went to reside with Capt Foskett with whom I have resided from that time to this—the signature Ann Slack to this will looking at it is not my handwriting—I never gave anybody authority to make that will or to write that name—I have never made any will Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q What is your age A Thirtyseven—I never had an interview with Mr Barber—I went in a carriage to the office door when Capt Foskett went in—he left me in the carriage—that only occurred once—this writing to the will does not resemble mine in the slightest degree—this is my name signed to one of these accounts WILLIAM CHRISTMAS I am a clerk in the Bank of England—I filled the situation of librarian there—that situation did not immediately enable me to become acquainted with the particulars of unclaimed dividends and stock in the Bank books but other parts of my duty enabled me to possess that information—I am now suspended—I know the prisoner Fletcher—I cannot say positively how long I have been acquainted with him—about four years or it may be near five—I am not sure—I have been in communication with him on the subject of unclaimed dividends in the Bank books on four occasions I think—I am only speaking now to the best of my recollection—I think somewhere about the autumn of 1842 1 gave him information with respect to some stock in the name of Slack—I cannot speak for a few weeks—I am not sure of the amount of the stock I told him of but I think 3500l or thereabouts in the Consolidated Three per cents —I told him it was standing in the name of Ann Slack—I did not at that time give him any other description of Ann Slack than the name but some little time after upon the second inquiry I gave him the description of Smith-street Chelsea the description that was in the books of the Bank—some time after Fletcher showed me a letter—I cannot say at what time but I think it might be some few months after—two months possibly or more—I cannot say exactly—I think it was thereabouts but I speak from a very imperfect recollection—he said he gave me that letter to satisfy me as to the identity of the party who he had found out to be the owner of the stock solely for that purpose looking at a letter —I do not remember the contents of the letter particularly but I think I remember to have seen this signature—I think this is the letter—I compared this signature with this power of attorney and the books of the Bank—after having done so I saw Fletcher again—I do not know how soon—I am not quite sure whether it might not be in the course of a day or two—to the best of my recollection I told him I thought there was something in the style of the writing but I thought it a lighter hand a younger hand or something to that effect—I forget now the term I used—the letter was the lighter—I think a very considerable time elapsed before I heard anything at all about it again—I believe the next observation I heard from him about it was that Miss Ann Slack of Abbotts Langley was not the person he supposed to be the proprietor for she had never lived at Chelsea—I understood she had stated so—I do not think anything more passed with respect to it till the probate was brought in and registered Q How did you learn that the probate had been brought in A I saw Mr Fletcher passing through the Bank at the time it was lying there and from him I heard it was then lying in the Will-office—he then observed to me he was satisfied that the Ann Slack of Abbotts Langley was not the party he had discovered the proprietor of the stock to be deceased and the probate was then there—hearing from him that there were two of the name I believe I said to the effect You must be very careful in the identity of the party —he said he was quite satisfied that he was right—I heard nothing from him about the transfer of the stock till after it was done—some two or three days afterwards he called upon roe to make me a remuneration for the information I had given him—he then told me the stock had been transferred in fact the stock had been transferred and sold—he left 100l in gold with me on that occasion which I have returned to him since his apprehension—I think it was in the last week in January or thereabouts Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q Did you return that money before you made any communication to anybody about this transaction A Yes before I told anybody concerned for this prosecution or anybody else about what had passed—I have given Mr Freshfield a detailed account of every-thing I have done while I have been in the Bank which has been fifty years—I cannot enumerate the persons besides Fletcher to whom I have given information about unclaimed dividends—there were several which Mr Fresh-field has a knowledge of—I supplied to him in writing as well as I could from my recollection every thing 1 had done—I think 1 supplied that information two months on Friday last—I have not received thousands of pounds from other persons besides Mr Fletcher for information I have given nor yet 500l —it may be 500l —I will swear it was not thousands—I have not seen or spoken to Fletcher since he has been in custody—he wrote to me requesting I would send him 100l —the person I gave the money to was a stranger to me but he introduced himself to me by the name of Lawrence—I never saw him before that I know of—he brought me a message from Fletcher requesting I would send the 100l —unfortunately for myself I did not come forward to give information I have often wished since that I had been honest enough to the Bank to have told them—it was not in consequence of what anybody said of me that they came to me but it was observed information was in possession of the Governor that I had been doing wrong in that respect and requesting me honestly to acknowledge all I did which I did—it was not in order to get free myself that I gave information—it will not place me in a better situation—I have offended so against the rules of the Bank that I am sure it will be unpardonable—I have never been examined before any Magistrate MR ERLE Q Look at this paper is that the account you gave A Yes—this is the truth which I set down in a very painful situation of course and to the best of my recollection I wrote it out for the satisfaction of the Governor of the Bank—there is only one person in this account besides Fletcher to whom I gave any information—it mentions the amount which I have received for my information several hundred pounds MR GREAVES Q Will you swear you have not given information to more than one other person besides Fletcher A In that paper there is only one other name—I did not give information to many other persons besides Fletcher—I have done so to several individuals who I have a personal know ledge of five six or seven—it has caused me many a painful sleepless night to endeavour to recollect because it has embraced a long period—I may have given information to five six or it might be seven I cannot be sure but those were individuals I personally knew and I only reminded them of what some of them possessed a knowledge of already MR ERLE Q Were those persons that you gave information to in the regular course of your business bankers and people you knew A Not under permission it was an offence against the rules even that—I had money for this but I never asked for any in my life—the other persons to whom I gave information are none of the persons now under charge—I never knew or heard of them before their apprehension MR GREAVES Q Were you asked about what you bad done by the Governor of the Bank A Not naming this in particular—I was asked to acknowledge what I had done offending against the rules of the Bank—in the first instance I certainly did prevaricate to him—I did not deny what I have done in the hope that it was not known JOHN APSLEY In 1842 I was a clerk at the King s Langley station on the Birmingham Railroad—I recollect two persons coming in the latter part of Sept 1842 to make enquiry about a family of the name of Slack—the prisoner Fletcher is one of those persons—I do not know who the other was—I have no belief on the subject—they made inquiries of me—Fletcher inquired if there was any lady of the name of Slack or a family residing in the neigh­bourhood of the name of Slack—I believe it was a lady—I named the family of the Slacks of Manor-house—I then said there was a Miss Slack residing with Captain and Mrs Foskett—Fletcher asked me if I knew the Christian name of the lady—I said Ann Slack and that Mrs Foskett was her sister—he asked me if the name of Ann was spelt Ann or Anne—I referred to a book of parcels delivery and it was Ann—they I do not remember which Fletcher I believe asked me if I knew that she ever resided in Chelsea—I said I did not know—I believe that was all the conversation I had—Mr John Slack lives in the neighbourhood—he lives at the Manor-house—I gave them the particulars of Mr John Slack s family and Fletcher said he believed it was not the family he believed it was not the same party—he said to his companion it was not the family they wanted—this took place in the office—Fletcher asked for some refreshment—they did not state any reason to me why they were making these inquiries—I did not ask them—I told them where Captain Foskett resided and offered to go with them—they said it was of no consequence they did not wish to go—they asked me if I knew whether Miss Slack ever resided in Chelsea with a Mr or Mrs Leek—I am sure that was mentioned—I said I did not know—when they left they said they would walk to the Watford station—in going to Watford they would pass Captain Foskett s house—I told them so Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q Are there not a great many persons come to the station you are at A There are not a great number—I first mentioned to Captain Foskett some time last Dec that something was said about Miss Slack having resided with a person of the name of Leek—that was the first time I mentioned anything about the persons having been to the station—I was required to come to London in Dec —I was at the Mansion-house but was not examined—I cannot say that I came up on purpose to be examined I came by Mr Freshfield s direction—I saw Mr Freshfield first—I believe I mentioned the name of Leek to Captain Foskett—I believe I mentioned it before it was mentioned to me but I will not swear—I first saw Fletcher since this inquiry begin at the Mansion-house in the dock—the examination was going on against him at the time—Barber was also in the dock nobody else—I had before that informed Mr Freshfield of what had passed at Abbots Lanley—I expected to see Fletcher in the dock when I went in JANE SARAH APSLEY I am the wife of John Apsley In the autumn of 1842 I was at the King s Langley station on the Birmingham Railway—I remember my husband bringing two persons into my house and saying in their presence that they came to make inquiry about a family of the name of Slack—I prepared tea for them—I recognise one of the persons the one with spectacles Fletcher —I cannot say as to the other—the one this way Saunders I think is about the sized person—he held his hand up to his face and concealed it therefore I am not able to form any belief or opinion about him—I do not recollect that he said anything particular about the Slacks—Fletcher did he inquired whether Mrs Foskett s Christian name was Margaret or Mary before her marriage—I told him I did not know—I proposed to take in candles—Fletcher said they did not require them—I sent in candles contrary to their wish—they Were sitting round the table—when the candles came in they got up put on their great coats to take leave and went away—I went in after the candles were taken in—they were then putting on their great coats Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q You sent in candles by a servant A Yes and they got up to put on their coats to go away—it was between tax and seven o clock in the afternoon and at the latter end of Sept —the first time any inquiry was made as to what I knew about this was some time before Christmas—I came up with my husband to London—I went to the Mansion-house—Mr Baxter Captain Foskett s attorney caused me to come up—I was not examined at the Mansion-house—I saw two persons in the dock there—I was a very short time in the presence of the two persons who were at our house—I was in and out of the room—it was longer than a minute or two MR ERLE Q Had you an opportunity of seeing the countenance and knowing the features of Fletcher A I had—he talked more than the other person—he had not spectacles at that time—I am certain he ia the man CAPTAIN JOSEPH FOSKETT I am an officer on half-pay residing at Abbots Langley I married the sister of Miss Ann Slask—Miss 8 lack lives with me—in Oct 1842 I received a letter singed Barber and Bircham WILLIAM JOHN DONALD I am acquainted with the handwriting of the prisoner Barber—I believe the signature Barber and Bircham to this letter to he in his handwriting CAPTAIN FOSKETT I wrote an answer to that letter—this is a copy of it—it is impossible to say the words—I believe it to be an exact copy—about the 26th of Oct I received this other letter to which I sent this answer— produced by Mr Wilkins —on the 29th of Oct I received this letter MR DONALD re-examined I believe the signature to this letter of the 26th of Oct to be Mr Barber s also this of the 29th only the signature—the body is not his Letters read — To Captain Foskett Abbotts Langley Herts 28 New Bridge-street Blackfriars London 4th Oct 1842 Sir —We have occasion to ascertain who is the legal personal representative of Ann Slack formerly of Chelsea spinster As we are informed you intermarried with some member of that lady s family we should feel obliged if you can inform us who are her executors administrators or other legal representatives We are Sir your very obedient servants BARBER and BIRCHAM From Captain Foskett to Barber and Bircham 75 King s-road Brighton Oct 13 1842 Gentlemen —In reply to your letter of the 4th inst addressed to me at Abbotts Langley I beg to inform you Miss Ann Slack is my wife s sister and resident with us her elder brother is also here Any further communications will reach her addressed as above for the present and next week Signed JOSEPH FOSKETT From Barber and Bircham to Captain Foskett 28 New Bridge-street Blackfriars London 25th Oct 1842 Sir —We are obliged by your letter of the 13th instant but as we find an entry of the death of Anne Slack formerly of Chelsea at Somerset House by which it appears she died at Bath we feel some doubt as to the identity of the lady in question If therefore it would not be giving you too much trouble we should feel exceedingly obliged by your acquainting us whether Mrs Foskett s sister formerly resided at Chelsea and whether she spelt her Christian name with or without an e We noticed in your letter you spelt her name Ann Signed BARBER and BIRCHAM From Captain Foskett to Barber and Bircham —king s-road Brighton Oct 27 1842 Gentlemen —Having extended our stay at Brighton your letter of the 25th inst has been forwarded to me In reply to which I beg to inform you Miss Anne Slack does spell her Christian name with an e and resided in Smith-street Chelsea with a family of the name of Leek about twelve years since and has constantly resided since that period with her sister and myself As you have not communicated the object of your inquiry it is not in my power to assist you further at present We shall feel obliged by information on that head and should it relate to bequests of the late Mrs Bevan deceased shall be glad to hear or upon any other matter Signed J FOSKETT —P S We shall leave Brighton on Wednesday next for Abbotts Langley Herts From Barber and Bircham to Captain Foskett 28 New Bridge-street Blackfriars London 29th Oct 1842 Sir —We are much obliged by your letter of the 27th inst and beg to know if it is probable that you will be in town shortly as we should be extremely glad if you could favour us with a call when the object of our inquiries shall be explained Signed BARBER and BIRCHAM CAPT FOSKETT In consequence of that letter I called at the office of Messrs Barber and Bircham—it must have been the first week of Nov —I think at the latter end of it—I went in company with Mrs Foskett and her sister and Mrs Leek—I left them in the carriage in the street and went in and had an interview with Mr Barber—he first asked me what property Miss Slack possessed whether she had landed property whether she had funded property and to a large amount whether she managed her affairs herself what was her age and I think he then communicated to me what had taken place the object of his inquiry that is to say that a lady had died and left a considerable sum of money to which he thought Miss Slack entitled—he asked me if she had ever signed a power of attorney and if I believed she had received all that was due to her—he asked many other questions—I think I then told him that I could not recommend Miss Slack to incur any expense until he could show me there was some reason to think she was entitled to something—he said that some trouble and expense had been incurred but at present that was his own that there probably might be more expense and perhaps some risk—he asked me if she had any wealthy relations likely to leave a considerable sum COURT Q Did you give any answer to the inquiry about her managing her affairs her age and whether she had landed or funded property A I said that she had still a trustee living who managed part of her affairs but that the rest was in her own hands and I think it was then he asked if I believed she had received the whole that was due to her—I said yes I believed so—I thought him reserved and I offered to identify ourselves as parties to whom he might give any information he thought proper to show who we were and I named certain parties Messrs Sutton Messrs Baxter of Lincoln s-inn-fields and Messrs Clark and Cooper of this Sessions-house—he said he knew Mr Clark very well but it was of no importance then—I told him I could introduce Miss Slack to him in a very short time if it was necessary—she was outside in the cab at that time—I did nut tell him so—he expressed no desire to see her MR ERLE Q Do You remember anything more at that interview A By that time Mrs Foskett who had been waiting a long time in the street in consequence of my having been detained a long time below before I saw Mr Barber came to the door and inquired how much longer I should be detained I desired her to come in and hear what the gentleman had to say upon which Mr Barber asked a question which I do not exactly remember but to which Mrs Foskett replied— You know my dear Mr Hulme always managed her affairs till his death I then rose to leave the room Mr Barber followed us to the top of the stairs and asked Is Miss Slack a person of strong nerves or likely to be much concerned or affected ox excited I cannot recollect the exact terms by the communication that a very considerable sum I may say 10 000l or even more has been left to her he concluded by saying that he had every reason to think that he should put her in early possession but there was a point of doubt—I told him I did not think Miss Slack would be very much concerned as she was sufficiently indifferent about these matters—I do not mean to say those were the precise words but to that effect—we then left—I think Mr Barber said that the lady who had left the property had died at Bath but he had previously written to me to that effect and I cannot say exactly—that she had died about six weeks since—the time at which she had died was part of the conversation—I asked when she had died and he said about six weeks since she had died or was buried—he requested J would not pursue the inquiry through any other channels—I think that was at the conclusion of the conversation—I am not quite sure at what time it was—I remember the fact perfectly well but cannot remember at what period it was—on the 28th of Nov I received this letter MR DONALD re-examined I believe the signature to that to be in the hand writing of Mr Barber— Read — 28 New Bridge-street Blackfriars 28th Nov 1842 —Re Ann Slack deceased —Sir —It would probably facilitate our inquiries if you could oblige us with the names of the trustees holding funded property for the benefit of Miss Ann Slack Requesting the favour of your early attention we remain &c BARBER and BIRCHAM CAPTAIN FOSKETT I sent no answer to that letter—I then received this to which I sent this answer MR DONALD The signature to this is also Mr Barber s— Read — 28 New Bridge-street Blackfriars London 12th Dec 1842 —Re Slack —Dear Sir —In reference to oar last letter some explanation of the object of the inquiry which it contained may be necessary It appears that the lady entitled to the property in question was possessed of a small portion of stock in the public funds and it would materially assist us in as­certaining the identity if you would acquaint us with the names of her trustees If you could at the same time favour us with her signature we think it would enable us at once to determine whether it is really her property or that of another party If you are likely to be in town in a few days we should feel obliged by the favour of a call We are desirous for the sake of all parties of clearing up the point with the least possible delay We remain &c Signed BARBER and BIRCHAM Captain Foskett to Barber and Bircham —Abbots Langley 13th Dec 1842 Gentlemen —I have deferred replying to your last inquiry with the intention of calling shortly and purpose being in town on Friday next or Saturday when I will do so about eleven or twelve o clock You will no doubt remember that I stated I could not recommend Miss Slack to make herself a party to inquiry that would incur any expense until she should see some little ground for supposing it probable she may prove to be the person legally entitled to the property bequeathed when she would be willing to enter into some arrangement As you have not yet favoured her with any further explanation we regret the reserve you think necessary as an obstacle to our throwing further light upon the subject which a very little communication might enable us to do Signed J FOSMTT CAPTAIN FOSKETT After that letter I called on Mr Baxter my attorney and in company with him I called on Mr Barber at his office—it was soon after receiving that letter—I do not remember exactly how soon—Mr Barber asked if he was a professional man—he said yes—he then proceeded to state in substance what he had stated to me before and he said it would facilitate his object if we could give him the signature of Miss Slack—I asked him by whom he was employed or the name of his informant—he said that he had enjoined him to give no particulars and no names but as he Mr Barber was resident in town and a professional man he left him to make the inquiries or to pursue the business—I do not recollect the expression exactly—I am not quite sure whether the remark was not made at the first interview—I do not distinctly recollect—he said he had access to information at the Bank not generally attainable—that remark was at the second interview when Mr Baxter was by—I asked Mr Barber if he would give me the name of any broker in order that I might see that be really had some knowledge with respect to Miss Slack whether he really knew anything about Miss Slack s affairs—that was my object—he did not mention any one—I do not at this moment remember whether he made any further inquiry about Miss Slack—at the conclusion of the interview I left with Mr Baxter—I heard nothing more of or from Mr Barber personally till this question arose in the Nov of 1843—I did from Mr Baxter but had no communication either by letter or verbally from Mr Barber about this matter afterwards Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q When did Mr Baxter give you any information A It arose thus I think—Mr Baxter and myself discussed the propriety of sending Miss Slack s signature to Mr Barber I returned home and told Miss Slack that Mr Baxter did not think any harm would occur but I thought it better she should not write to Mr Barber but address Mr Baxter which she did and which was conveyed to Mr Baxter—I did not hear some time after that the real owner had been discovered—I never heard that the real claimant had been discovered—Mr Baxter informed me that he had received a communication from Mr Barber stating that he was satisfied Miss Slack was not the party entitled to it—at our interview he expressed the opinion that Miss Slack was the party entitled to it—I told Mr Barber that I did not know exactly Miss Slack s age I might have said she was about twenty-seven I do not know—he said forty would do therefore I took no great trouble to remember—I at the same time said I did not exactly know her age MR ROBERT BAXTER I am a solicitor and live in Lincoln s-inn-fields On the 17th of Dec 1842 I accompanied Captain Foskett to the office of Barber and Bircham in Bridge-street Blackfriars and had an interview with Mr Barbar—Mr Barber said he could give some information relative to some property—he stated that he was enquiring relative to the representatives of Ann Slack—Captain Foskett gave him some information relative to Miss Slack—he said the description Captain Foskett gave coincided very much with the party for whom they were enquiring but there was a discrepancy which could be cleared if he could have Miss Slack s handwriting to compare with some document—I believe he mentioned documents—he did not mention what they were—I do not recollect anything particular that passed beyond that—Captain Foskett afterwards consulted me on the propriety of giving the hand Writing and a note was written by Miss Slack purporting to be addressed to myself—this is the note it was forwarded to me by Captain Foskett to be given to Mr Barber—I took it to Mr Barber on the 22nd of Dec—I saw him—I merely left it with him—nothing passed—I received this letter two days after from Mr Barber enclosing Miss Slack s note MR DONALD re-examined This is Mr Barber s handwriting— Read — Rose Hill Dec 21st My dear Mr Baxter —As Captain Foskett informs me you have had an interview with Messrs Barber and Bircham and think there is no objection to their seeing my signature for the purpose of assisting their inquiries respecting the property to which they think I may be entitled I have sent it to you that you may submit it to their inspection as you think right Signed ANNE SLACK 28 Bridge-street Blackfriars 4th Jan 1843 Dear Sirs —We beg to return Miss Slack s letter and to state that we find the signatures do not correspond and consequently we have arrived at the conclusion that the identity cannot be supported We trust you will be good enough to consider this negotiation confidential and should our exertions to discover the right party prove successful we shall not fail to communicate to you the result for the satisfaction of the young lady and her friends Signed BARBER and BIRCHAM MR BAXTER re-examined Q Did you hear from Barber and Bircham or either of them from that time till the discovery of this A I am not quite certain—I once met Mr Barber in the street and I mentioned the circumstance to him but whether it was before or after I received this letter I cannot say—nothing of any importance passed—no communication was made to me of the discovery of the right owner—Mr Barber was quite a stranger to me when I first went to him—Captain Foskett gave him my name—I do not know whether he gave him my address—I think he gave him my name as his attorney—I think Mr Barber said Are you in the profession Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q You remember meeting Mr Barber once was that in Lincoln s-inn-fields A I think it was at the corner of the gate going into Lincoln s-inn—I spoke to him on the business—I have forgotten the conversation—I rather think it was asking if he had had an opportunity of comparing Miss Slack s letter with the writing MR ERLE Q Can you say whether he told you be had found out the party entitled to this property A He did not GEORGE OFFLEY I am a solicitor residing in Henrietta-street Coven-garden In 1843 I was acquainted with Misa Ann Slack who formerly resided in Smith-street Chelsea—I was not intimately acquainted with her I knew she lived there—in March 1843 I saw an advertisement relating to a Miss Ann Slack in consequence of which I wrote a letter to Barber and Bircham to whom the advertisement said communication was to be made—this is the letter I wrote— read — March 8 1843 Gentlemen —I saw an advertisement in the Times of this morning inserted by your firm for the discovery of the representatives of Miss Anne Slack formerly of Chelsea spinster I know a lady of that name residing with her brother-in-law Captain Foskett at Rose-cottage Abbotts Langley Herts who resided some years in Chelsea and who had an uncle named John Slack who lived in Sloane-street Chelsea GEORGE OFFLEY I afterwards received this answer MR DONALD re-examined I am not certain whether this signature is Mr Barber s writing—I will not swear it is his MR WILKINS Q DO you know Mr Bircham s writing A I believe I do—I certainly do not believe it to be his writing—I am not so well acquainted with the signature of Mr Bircham as I am with that of Mr Barber therefore I cannot give an opinion MR OFFLEY re-examined I know nothing at all of Mr Barber or Mr Bircham—I did not go to their office about this matter or see either of them about it THOMAS BAYNER CHAPELL I am superintendent registrar of births deaths and marriages of the parish of St George Hanover-square—the Belgrave district is within that parish—I produce the original register of deaths of the Belgrave district in which I find an entry of the death of a person named Ann Slack of No 8 South-terrace on the 17th of Feb 1843 —Mr Jordan is the registrar of the Belgrave district—I received the original register from Mr Jordan within three days after the 30th of Sept —it was not full till the 17th of August but it is returned to me when they come to make up their quarter s returns ending on the 30th of Sept —it baa never been out of my hands since it was handed to me WILLIAM PREW JORDAN I am the registrar of births deaths and marriages for the Belgrave district On the evening of the 25th of Feb last year the prisoner Fletcher called on me and said he came to register a death—I asked him when it occurred—he said on the 17th of Feb —I asked where—he said No 8 South-terrace—I said I did not know such a place as South-terrace in the district there was a South-place and asked whether he meant that or whether he meant some houses further on which went by the name of terrace but there was no name written up—they were called Ranelagh terrace and Kemp s-terrace a part of them—I asked whether he meant those houses near the wooden bridge—he said yes—I asked the number—he said No 8—I said I did not think there were so many as eight—he said there was and I entered it as such as I find it here—he gave me the name of Ann Slack and I wrote it down in his presence—I asked him how the name Ann was spelt with or without an e—he said with an e—I then entered the word female under the sex and the age sixty-eight years—I got that from Fletcher from what he told me—I inquired if she was a married woman or not—he said no—I asked her occupation—he said she was a gentlewoman and a spinster—I then asked the cause of death which he stated to be gout—I asked whether it was gout of the stomach heart or head because I said People don t usually die of gout except it attacks some internal organ —he said she had been a long sufferer with the complaint—I then entered it as gout simply—I then asked him if he were present at the death and he answered yes—I have so written it—I then asked him his address and he gave me No 4 James-street —I asked him Where what James-street —he said Commercial-road —I said there was no James-street Commercial-road Pimlico there was a Robert-street—I asked him which Commercial-road he meant whether he meant Commercial-road Lambeth or Commercial-road East because there are two other Commercial-roads in London—he said Commercial-road East—he then signed his name Robert Hart and I affixed the day of the month to the entry 25th Feb 1843 and signed it myself—I then gave him a certificate which he was to hand to the undertaker to be given to the clergyman—I do not recollect whether he asked for it I gave it as a matter of course—on the 14th of March a woman came to me dressed in deep mourning and in consequence of what she said to me I gave her a copy of the register—this is it—I cannot recollect the woman who came positively I did not take much notice of her—I cannot gay either one way or the other whether it was either of the female prisoners Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q Do you mean to say you can speak positively to Fletcher A I swear positively to him to the best of my belief and knowledge as far as the recollection of a man coming to my house once I should say he is the man—I have never entertained any doubts about him at all and the more I see him the more I am confirmed in that belief—he was dressed in a small brown top coat not a great coat but a great surtout—he had not spectacles on at that time—the man who came to me was not a taller and stouter man—I have never said so nor that the man bad light hair—I do not know a Mr Henry Fletcher I never heard of him—I certainty never told any one that the person who entered the registry had light hair it was dark brown almost approaching to black—I first saw Fletcher after this charge at Giltspur-street Compter he was in a cell alone when I first saw him—I was taken there with a view to see if I could identify the person who came to my house—I went round «to a great many cells with the Governor and at last came to a cell where Fletcher was alone—it was in the evening when he came to my place between seven and eight o clock I should say as near as I can guess—I had candles—he might be there a quarter of an hour I cannot say to a minute MR CLARKSON Q YOU went to several cells in which you saw prisoners alone A There were several in some cells and when I saw Fletcher I was sure he was the person—he was alone—he had not spectacles on at that time—I did not notice his hair particularly at that time—it was partly grizzled not quite so grey as it is now JOHN ROYCE TOMKINS I am a clerk to Messrs Freshfield solicitors to the Bank About six weeks or two months ago I made a search in the index of the general register of deaths at Somerset-house from the 1st of July 1837 to the 31st of Dec 1842—I did not find any entry there of the death of a person named Ann Slack of Smith-street Chelsea or of Bath—I am sure there is no such entry—I have also looked in the neighbourhood of the wooden bridge Pimlico for a terrace called South-terrace—the wooden bridge is at the end of the Belgrave-road—I believe it crosses the Grosvenor-canal—it is this side of King s-road to the left I should say but it is before you come to King s-road—I could not find any South-terrace—I found a South-place and a No 8—I could not find any trace of a person of the name of Ann Slack there—I found a Commercial-road in that neighbourhood—I could not find any James-street there—I also inquired in the neighbourhood of Commercial-road East—I did not find any James-street Commercial-road East properly so described although there arc several James-streets in the vicinity—I made inquiries at No 4 in every one of those streets—I could gain no tidings whatever at either of those houses of a person of the name of Robert Hart Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q What book was it you searched at Somerset-house A The Index—I was told so by the officials in the office—I have been there before to search—there were persons in the office whom I paid for the search—I did not know any of them personally—I know nothing of the book except what they told me—I do not recollect that I saw its title MR BODKIN Q What office was it at A The General Registry-office Somerset-house—that was written up over the door—I have searched at the same office upon other occasions—I do not know that it was the same book HENRY PAGE From Sept 1842 to Oct 1843 1 occupied the house No 8 South-place Pimlico near the wooden-bridge—during the whole of that time no person named Slack resided in that house MARTHA ANN NEVILLE I am the daughter of Mr Neville a tailor and live at No 7 Francis-street Tottenham-court-road About the 9th of March last year I remember Mrs Dorey coming to my father s house to take a lodging for a lady who she said was coming out of the country about law business I think it was about Thursday the 9th of March and between twelve and one o clock —she said she could not give a reference but offered to pay a week in advance instead—she said she would come again in about two hours—I waited till the end of the two hours and then went out—when I returned in the evening I found another person bad come into the lodging and next morning I saw Mrs Saunders at the lodging—she called herself Miss Slack—she remained in the lodging three weeks and a day or a month and a day—she left on Friday the 7th of April—Mrs Dorey came for her and they went away together in a cab—at the time Mrs Saunders was occupying the lodging Mrs Dorey addressed her as Miss Slack—she came to see her about two or three times a week in the evening—Mrs Saunders wore light flaxen ringlets—I attended to her bed-room and while she was there I noticed there was dark hair in the comb—I did not notice the brush—Mrs Saunders always wore a bonnet in-doors—Mrs Dorey asked for Miss Slack when she came to see her—I did not at that time know Mrs Dorey s name—Mrs Saunders said if any body came hut her lawyer I was to say she did not live there—there was a dark gentleman called who she said was her lawyer—she told me so—he called about once a week and sometimes he has been twice—I do not know him Cross-examined by MR STONE Q You are quite sure it was on the 9th of March in the last year that she called A Yes I first saw Mrs Saunders after the 7th of April at the Mansion-house in March this year—I had not seen her for twelve months—she was then in custody—I knew she was in custody before I saw her—I saw no other lady in custody at that time—I had before that seen Mrs Dorey in Oxford-street—I did not then know that Mrs Dorey was the sister of Mrs Saunders—I did not know it till lately—I knew it when I went to the Mansion-house—I went to Mrs Dorey s house with Forrester—I never saw Mrs Saunders without a bonnet—she had light ringlets—they were false—I know that because there was dark hair in the comb and they looked like false ringlets—they hung like false ringlets—I first made that statement to Mr Forrester—that was before I had seen Mrs Dorey—I am sure of that—it was about Nov —I am sure I told Forrester that she had light flaxen ringlets or false hair—I explained to him at the time that she had dark hair in the comb—I stated that to him before I went to see Mrs Dorey—I do not know that Forrester searched for any light flaxen ringlets at Mrs Dorey s—I did not hear him ask Mrs Dorey for some white ringlets—I first discovered the black hair in the comb when I went up stairs into her bed-room—I cannot name the day—It was when she lived at our house—she had a hair brush—I did not wash it for her—I waited on her—it was on the dressing table—I did not notice any black hair about it—she only had one brush—Mrs Dorey has dark hair—I never saw her in Mrs Saunders s bed-room—she never went there to my knowledge—her bed-room was above the sitting-room—she was not a good deal there—she called two or three times a week—she never spent an evening with her—she stopped a very little time—I was mostly at home during the whole month—I was very seldom out—I was sometimes—I did not sometimes spend the evening out—I did the first night but I was home at ten o clock then—it was not my proposal that Mrs Dorey should pay a week in advance—she told my mother who let the lodging—I did not hear her—she told me she could not give a reference—I have not travelled a good deal with Forrester—I have been out with him in search for the person—I had never seen this person before whoever she was—I have always told the same story—I was examined before the Lord Mayor Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Did she tell you what her lawyer s name was A No—she never said that his name was Jones—I sometimes opened the door to admit the person she said was her lawyer and sometimes my mother did—I have since seen a person a great deal like him but I could not swear to his face—that is the one Fletcher —I never saw Mrs Saunders write MR CLARKSON Q When you saw Mrs Saunders at the Mansion-house where was she A In the room before she went into the justice-room—she walked past me—there were other persons there—I had no doubt of her when I saw her—I gave an account of the light ringlets before Mrs Saunders was taken into custody—she was standing by herself at the Mansion-house—I pointed her out to Mr Forrester before any question was asked about her—I did so as she walked past to Mr Weir—I am quite sure that she is the same person MR STONE Q When she walked through was she in custody A She was—she had not flaxen ringlets on then MR CLARKSON Q Was the woman in the habit of coming and sitting with you in the kitchen during the month she was staying there A Sometimes—I was in the habit of seeing her every day during the three weeks or month—I waited upon her at her meals as well as in her bed-room COURT Q Did not the flaxen ringlets make a strange alteration in her appearance A She looked rather different but I took notice of her features—I am twenty-nine years old—I remember her face—she had rather high cheek bones and her nose was rather broad at the bottom MARTHA NEVILLE I am the mother of the last witness I remember a person coming to take lodgings at my house—I believe on the 9th of March but I will not be sure—it was the 8th or 9th—I am not sure which—I saw the person that came to take the lodging—I had some conversation with her on the day the lodgings were taken but very little—I afterwards saw that same person calling at the lodging occasionally generally about every evening—I have sometimes opened the door to let her in but it wat generally dusk—I recognise Mrs Dorey as the person—I went with Forrester to a house in Oxford-street lately and there saw Mrs Dorey—between seven and eight o clock in the evening on which Mrs Dorey took the lodging the person for whom she took them came in a c ab with Mrs Dorey—I asked Mrs Dorey when she came first for a reference and she could not give one but paid me one week in advance—she staid a very little while after bringing the other lady—that other woman continued to occupy the lodging three weeks and a day or a month and a day—I do not know which—Mrs Saunders is that person—I am positive of it—I knew her by the name of Miss Slack—Mrs Dorey gave her that name—I called her Miss Slack and no other name—Mrs Dorey came to see her almost erery evening—a gentleman came to see her who she said was her lawyer—I cannot be certain how often he has called—about two or three times a-week—I cannot exactly say Cross-examined by MR STONE Q HOW long have you let lodgings A I have been in the habit of letting lodgings above forty years—there is nothing unusual in paying a week s lodging in advance—it is often done—I never saw this lady without a bonnet while she was lodging with me—I never saw her before she came to occupy my lodging—she left in the beginning of April—I never saw her after she left my place until I saw her at the Mansion-house—my daughter was then with me—I did not learn from her that she had seen her before I saw her—I do not know in what part of the Mansion-house she was—she was in custody of an officer—she was brought up by the officer and came through the room where the Lord Mayor was—I have not heard my daughter s description of her here—I have not been in Court—I expected to see the woman when I went to the Mansion-house—I waited for that purpose—my daughter and I were both together—I cannot see very well without spectacles—I constantly wear spectacles at home—I do not know how long ago it is that I went to see Mrs Dorey—I went with my daughter and Mr Weir to recognise Mrs Dorey in Oxford street—Forrester was not with us—when Mrs Dorey came to see Mrs Saunders she used to go into her room—she did not stop a great while—she was there most even­ings MR BODKIN Q Had you your spectacles on when you were at the Mansion-house A Yes—I was not in the room with the Lord Mayors but in a room through which people go in order to get into his room—several persons had passed through before Mrs Saunders—I did not notice any thing happening to my daughter when Mrs Saunders came into the room—she cried a little—I do not know what for—it was when she saw Mrs Saunders—my attention had not been drawn to several other females at the Mansion-house before I saw her Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Did you ever see the lady that was lodging at your house write A No COURT Q Did she not wear hair of a totally different colour to what she has on now A Yes—that did not alter my opinion of her still the same person—I heard my daughter say something about her nose here I believe—I was not in court two minutes—I have not the least doubt about Mrs Saunders being the woman that was brought to me under the name of Slack JOHN WILLS I am a proctor in Doctors Commons I am acquainted with Mr Barber—on the 16th of March he called on me in company with a female—she was a stranger to me—this entry in my diary is my head-writing—the female went by the name of Emma Slack—I cannot recollect whether that name was given by her or Mr Barber—it was said in his hear­ing—the date at the top of this will is in my handwriting—I have very little recollection of the subject but from what little 1 can recollect the second female L Saunders resembles her—one or the other gave me instructions to obtain probate of this will—I cannot say which—this will was produced to me to obtain probate—Emma Slack is the name mentioned in the will as executrix—I do not know whether the female used the word executrix she signed the affidavit and oath was administered to her as executrix—I am not certain whether she or Mr Barber spoke—I obtained probate of the will—the effects were sworn under 5000l —I received a check at the time from Mr Barber for 80l the stamp-duty—on the 22nd of March I sent the probate to the office of Barber and Co Cross-examined by MR STONE Q How long was Mr Barber and the lady in your presence A About five minutes—I saw the lady next at the Mansion-house about a month ago—a great number of persons come to my office for the same purpose—I cannot charge my memory whether the lady spoke at all—I am sure Mr Barber spoke—it is an ordinary thing for an executor or executrix to take no part in the transaction Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Was not Mr Barber s conduct as far as you witnessed it perfectly consistent with that of an honourable attorney A Perfectly so—I implicitly believed the lady to be Miss Slack—I might have questioned her or Mr Barber I cannot say which as to the time of death of the deceased and such questions as that—that would be necessary to fill up the ordinary forms—I have known Mr Barber I think since some time in 1842—I have not done business for Barber and Bircham since this transaction—this was the last transaction—I had done business for them before—I sent the probate directed to Barber and Bircham to their office—I always regarded Mr Barber as an upright and honourable man MR ERIE Q You say when she was introduced you implicitly believed her to be Miss Slack did you trust entirely to Mr Barber for that A Yes I trusted entirely to Mr Barber—I do not remember such a thing occurring to me as an entire stranger coming to my office and employing me to take out probate—they have always been introduced to me by some person I rely upon who either brings or sends them—I have some reference—a party I know attends with the executor or executrix—I take them on their representation—a person might bring an executor to my office on the recommendation of a friend—I should take that friend s word Q You have said Mr Barber s conduct was consistent with that of an honourable and honest attorney was there anything in this matter more than the mere employment of you to take out probate A No nothing more—it was one of the most ordinary transactions that could take place JOHN WELDON I am clerk in the Will-office in the Bank I produce the Will-taking-in book—on the 27th of March 1843 probate of the will of Ann Slack was left at the Bank—I cannot say by whom it was left—this letter addressed to the Governor of the Bank was left at the Bank most likely the day following—I cannot say precisely the day whether it was that day or the day following—it was left at the Will-office at the Bank—the probate was registered at the Bank on the 31st of March—this letter is an application for the re-transfer of the stock—the probate appears to have been returned on the same day the 31st to N B Bircham Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Is the signature of Mr Bircham attached to that A Yes to the re-delivery of the probate—I cannot tell who it was that lodged the probate on the 27th MR CLARKSON Q DOCS that letter bear any memorandum of yours A Yes—it bears a copy of the register in the registry book MR DONALD re-examined I cannot identify whose writing the words Francis-street Tottenham Court road are—this 17th February in figures in the body of the letter is Mr Barber s handwriting—the other is in the handwriting of another party Cross-examined by MR MILKINS Q Have you not precisely the same means of knowing Mr Bircham s handwriting as Mr Barber s A I have not paid so many of Mr Bircham s checks as I have of Mr Barber s—I have paid several of Mr Bircham s but it was seldom two or three checks of his were written alike therefore I cannot identify his writing—I cannot identify this to be his—I cannot tell how many of his checks I have paid certainly not scores—there may be a score—Barber and Bircham may have banked at the Bank of England two years—their checks have generally speaking been joint checks—I decline to identify this writing—I cannot identify it—I cannot say whether I believe it to be Mr Bircham s writing—I cannot say that I have ever seen Mr Barber write in my life MR ERLE Q Does Mr Barber write alike generally A Yes and Mr Bircham does not MB WILKINS Q Have not the checks that have been paid been the joint checks of Barber and Bircham on almost every occasion A Certainly not—I have paid Mr Barber s checks separately and have been in the habit of seeing his checks much more frequently than Mr Bircham s—I have been a clerk in the Bank fifteen years and am thirty-three years of age—I have never sworn to handwriting from having seen it less frequently than Mr Bircham s—I have no belief about this handwriting—I have paid sums of money on the sight of Mr Bircham s writing—I cannot recollect paying any checks written by Mr Bircham in my life—I have paid on his signature jointly with Mr Barber s—that is not all I have done with Mr Barber s—I have paid them from the body—I can prove Mr Bircham s signature but not his writing—I can give an opinion on his signature but not his writing because to my know­ledge I have never paid checks written by him This document was as follows — To the Governor of the Bank of England Sir —There was lately standing in the name of Anne Slack of Chelsea spinster the sum of 3500l in the Three per Cent Consolidated Bank Annuities From the period which has elapsed since any dividends have been received it is possible that the amount may have been carried to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt My aunt died on the 17th day of February last leaving me her sole legatee and executrix I have since proved the will the probate whereof has been duly lodged in the Will-office of the Bank and I shall therefore be glad to have the stock in question transferred into my name Dated this 24th day of March 1843 EMMA SLACK sole legatee and executrix of the deceased Anne Slack No 7 Francis-street Tottenham-court-road WILLIAM SMEE ESQ re-examined I consequence of this letter I obtained this order to re-transfer the sum of 3500l from the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt to Emma Slack and to pay the arrears of dividends to Emma Slack spinster of No 7 Francis-street Tottenham-court-road sole executrix of Ann Slack deceased of Smith-street Chelsea spinster—this is the order and I accordingly made the re-transfer Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Did you see the female who called herself Emma Slack write A No—the signature was not made in my presence— The order was dated Sd April 1843 by J Heath Esq deputy governor to transfer the said 3500l with the unclaimed dividends amounting to 1151l 18s 10d to the said Emma Slack JOHN PADMORE NOBLE I am an assistant accountant to the Bank of England—I know Mr Barber I saw him at the Accountant s-office on the 7th April 1843 a female was in company with him who he represented as Emma Slack—he called her so to me—Mrs Saunders is that female to the best of my belief—I had an opportunity of seeing her features I should say that is the party—I cannot say that I have any doubt about it—Mr Barber said he came for the purpose of receiving the dividends on the stock that had been transferred from the account Ann Slack to the Commissioners and which he expected to find re-transferred and required me to pay the amount—I turned to the book and having found the stock re-transferred I gave him to understand that it would be necessary for him to be identified to me and therefore the stock-broker or some person that I was personally known to should accompany him for the purpose of identification—Mr Barber I believe went from the office and fetched Mr Philpot the stock-broker—when he came I required this document to be signed reads Paid 7th April 1843 Emma Slack spinster executrix of Ann Slack spinster deceased known to me and under those words Mr Philpot has signed his name—I gave Mr Barber a memorandum which enabled the party signing as Emma Slack to receive the amount of the dividends amounting to 1150l odd from the chief cashier—it was merely a memorandum that passes from one office to the other and which enables him to get the order for 1150l odd unclaimed dividends due on Ann Slack s account Cross-examined by MR STONE Q What time in the day was it when Mr Barber and the person of the name of Emma Slack came to your office I should say about one o clock in the day—there was nothing particular out of the ordinary course of business which took place on that occasion that I am aware of—it was the usual routine—the female may have been perhaps ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in my presence—I should say a quarter of an hour at least—she did not that I recollect make any observation to me—I do not think she made any observation—I do not remember hearing her speak at all—I saw her next at the Mansion-house—I went there for the purpose of seeing her—many other persons came to my office in the course of that year to transact similar business—fifty or more it may be 100—there was something that attracted my attention to her—she remained at a distance and appeared somewhat lame or leaning as it were on one side—she was standing up—she had a veil on and was dressed in black I think—there was a particular leaning of her form as if labouring under some infirmity—I think the veil was partly down not completely—I recollect that it was a black veil Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Did you see Emma Slack write A No MR ERLE Q Had you an opportunity of seeing her features A I had COURT Q Do you mean positively to swear she is the woman or only that you believe it A I have no reason to doubt her being the party—I entertain no doubt in my own mind that she is the party that came THOMAS BROS I am assistant to the chief cashier at the Bank of England On the 7th of April last this authority was brought to me to give orders for the payment of some dividends amounting to 1100l odd—I signed the order—I did not get this from Mr Noble—it is left in the Cashier s office and when the parties come for it it is brought to me and I sign it—it was brought to me and I in the course of business there signed the order on the 7th of April 1843 for the payment of unclaimed dividends in the Long Annuities amounting to 1151l 18s 10d the amount due on the stock that had been transferred—that is to enable the party to take this to the cashiers of the Bank at the Drawing-office and receive the money—that would be the last thing before taking the money—when I give an order of that sort this book is produced and I take an acknowledgment from the party of the receipt of that order—it is signed Emma Slack spinster sole executrix of the said Ann Slack spinster deceased—seeing Emma Slack had signed it in the book was my authority for signing this order—the party who pays it does not come before me—there is a counter at the office but I am a considerable distance from it Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Did you see the signature of Emma Slack written A No I saw it was written COURT Q The order shows whose stock it is that is about to be paid and who received it A Yes it is the unclaimed dividends of Ann Slack paid to Emma Cross-examined by MR STONE Q Where was this book signed A At the counter of the chief cashier s office and from thence brought to me with this order ROBERT GUNSTON DOVER I am a clerk in the Drawing-office of the Bank of England This order to pay was brought to me on the 7th of April I believe I am not positive as to the date—I merely cancelled it and passed it to the next clerk for payment—I saw that there were two persons who brought it a man and a woman—I enquired how it should be paid and I think the man referred me to the back of this document— reads —it is Gold 600l notes four 100l and one 100l — notes twenty-five seems to have been rubbed out and the one 100l inserted in its stead—there remains 50l but it does not appear in what notes that was paid—I merely marked it part bank-notes and part money—the man had a small bag to take the gold in I told him that would not be sufficient to hold that quantity of gold he asked for—upon that he went away and procured a larger one—the next clerk paid it—I do not know who these persons were MR DONALD re-examined This writing in pencil at the back of this order Gold 600l notes four 100l and so on I believe to be written by Mr Barber WILLIAM OBADIAH WHEELER I am a clerk in the Drawing-office of the Bank of England—I have been acquainted with Mr Barber s handwriting three or four years—I have paid checks of his—this pencil writing at the back of the order to pay Gold 600l &c I should say is Mr Barber s handwriting I believe it to be so Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q DO you know Mr Bircham s writing A I have seen it I am not much acquainted with it—the handwriting at the bottom of this application to re-transfer Francis-street I should certainly not recognise to be Mr Bircham s—I will not say I do not believe it is looking at a letter in reply to Mr Offley s I cannot give an opinion on that letter—I am not so familiar with Mr Bircham s handwriting as I am with Mr Barber s—very few checks of Mr Bircham s have come under my inspection—I cannot enumerate the number GEORGE WOLFE GOUGH I am a clerk in the Drawing-office of the Bank of England On the 7th of April 1843 an order for 1150l dividends was presented to me to be paid—I paid it according to the directions at the back of the paper—a man and woman presented it and came for the money—I do not recollect who the man was—I believe Lydia Saunders to the best of my belief to be the person I paid it to Cross-examined by MR STONE Q HOW do you know her name is Lydia Saunders A She has been pointed out to me as Lydia Saunders when I saw her at the Mansion-house—she was not pointed out to me as Lydia Saunders I only knew her as Lydia Saunders after she was taken before the Lord Mayor—I cannot say who pointed her out to me as Lydia Saunders—it was not Mr Weir I believe—it was one of the persons in the court—it was in general conversation—to the best of my recollection the parties came to me about half-past one or from that to a quarter to two o clock—I think the man spoke to me on the subject of the payment and I think the man received the money—I believe the woman spoke to me—I think she did to the best of my knowledge—she asked how the money should be received—I did not see that on the back until it was pointed out to me—I think it was the man pointed that out—I should say the woman did not tell me how it was to be paid after the man pointed that out to me—I cannot now recollect what she said—no other persons came to me that day to draw money for unclaimed dividends—it is impossible to say how many came for other money—I see by my book forty other persons received money from me that day but there was only one unclaimed dividend—the principal part of the payments of that day were to bankers clerks and brokers—I cannot tell with or without my book whether I paid to any woman that day—I had never seen the person before—I bad never seen Lydia Saunders till I saw her the other day at the Mansion-house—she was not pointed out to me—she was afterwards—I did not give any evidence before the Lord Mayor—I did not know it was her until she was pointed out COURT Q Then you did not pick her out A I did pick her out—the question was asked me whether I could tell the woman —I said I believe to the best of my belief that is the woman —there was no name mentioned to me at that time—afterwards I was told it was Lydia Saunders—I believe she stood at the side of the bar—I think just by the door MR STONE Q In custody and under charge A I do not think she was—of course she was in custody but not in the dock—she was by the side of the door—I did not see an officer by the side of her—I was not examined before the Lord Mayor MR ERLE Q When you paid the money did you have the order signed A It came to me already signed—it was not signed in my presence—it is not usual to sign it in the presence of the party paying Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q What makes you believe it was the man that pointed out the directions at the back of that paper A I believe it was—there was a man came with the woman that is all I recollect—I would not swear to the man—the lady had not a white veil on—she had a fall I believe black over the bonnet something like crape over the front of the bonnet—all the entries in this book are in my hand writing—I know the firm of Drewett and Co —I have no doubt I paid them something on that day if the entry is made there—I do not remember paying them anything on that day—I do not remember seeing anybody there from that firm on that day—I know Messrs Goslings—I do not know Mr Bircham s handwriting MR ERLE Q Look at your memorandum of April the 7th do you remember your having made a payment to Drewetts when you see your memorandum A Yes seeing this I remember making a payment upon that day—I keep an account of the payments that I make—I do not remember it but I have not the least doubt I made the payment because I see it here—it is usual to pay unclaimed dividends to a large amount but not to pay a large amount in gold—my attention was called particularly to it by that—about twelve or fifteen months previous to this transaction there was a large payment in gold—that was unclaimed dividends MR DONALD re-examined This address Tottenham-court-road under the signature of Emma Slack I believe to be Mr Barber s handwriting Cross-examined by MR STONE Q Pray who wrote these words Emma Slack A I cannot say Mr Smee s certificate of the transfer of 3500l Three per Cent Consols dated the 3rd of April 1843 formerly standing in the name of Ann Slack of Smith-street spinster from the account of the Commissioners of the National Debt to Emma Slack of Francis-street Tottenham-court-road spinster was here read Also the order to pay 1 151l 18s 10d being the unclaimed dividends on the same on the back of which was written Emma Slack executrix 7 Francis-street Tottenham-court-road and in pencil gold 600l notes 400l 100l 50l 1l 18s 10d total 1151l 18s 10d Adjourned Wednesday April 17th THE QUEEN AGAINST BARBER AND OTHERS CONTINUED CAPTAIN FOSKETT re-examined by the COURT I think nothing was said by myself or Mr Baxter to Mr Barber respecting the residence of Miss Slack—I had written to that effect—when I first called on Mr Barber I announced myself as Captain Foskett and as having received letters from him on the subject of Miss Slack s affairs—I do not remember whether anything was said about my residence or where Miss Slack had ever resided—in the statement I made yesterday I may have stated an observation as made at the second interview which passed at the first I cannot be quite certain as to that I gave it as it occurred as well as I could—I do not remember at either conversation anything being said about where Miss Slack was living at that time or had lived WILLIAM PHILPOT I am a stock-broker I have known the prisoner Fletcher about ten years and have known Mr Barber four or five years—I remember a few days before the 7th of April seeing Mr Fletcher in the Rotunda at the Bank—he said that Barber had got a good job for me—he did not tell me what it was—he did not say it was to transfer stock but I understood so—I do not know that it was mentioned—on the 7th of April I saw Barber at my office in Tokenhouse-yard—there was-a lady in his company—I had never seen her before—she was introduced to me by Barber by the name of Emma Slack—it was the prisoner Lydia Saunders—Barber gave me directions to sell 3 500l Consols standing in the name of Emma Slack—I do not recollect Lydia Saunders making any observation—Barber told me Mr Fletcher was expected to meet them—Barber Mrs Saunders and I proceeded over to the Bank to the Accountant-General s Office for taking unclaimed dividends on 3 500l Consols—I applied for an order for those dividends which was given to me—I signed to the identity of Emma Slack—it is usual for a person applying for dividends to be identified by a broker—I signed these words known to me —this is my signature to the identity—I then went with Barber and Emma Slack to the chief cashier—the order was presented by me to the best of my belief—we then got an order to go to the drawing-office for the money—that order looking at it was given to Barber—I did not observe any pencil writing at the back of it—I left Barber and Mrs Saunders in the drawing-office to take the money—I then went to put forward the transfer for the 3 500l stock—I had arranged with Barber to meet again in the Rotunda—I sold the 3 500l to Clement Smith a stock-jobber for 3 386l 5s which he paid to me in notes—I have a memorandum here of bank-stock cash 3 382l after deducting my commission which was 4l —I think I received three 1000l notes—the others I do not recollect—after receiving that I came to the Rotunda—on coming from the Drawing-office before I went to sell I saw Fletcher in the Rotunda and observed to him that there was 1100l in dividends that was being received—I then went and sold the stock and came back to the Rotunda and found Barber Mrs Saunders and Fletcher there—I gave the money to Mr Barber I heard a conversation between the three about changing a 1000l note for gold—I cannot say who spoke—they then left me and went away together where to I do not know—I went to my office—they were all three present when I gave the money to Barber—I gave him the same notes as I received from Clement Smith Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q How many times have you been to the Mansion-house when Fletcher was examined A But once—I may have been twice—I was communicating with the attorney for the prosecution while Fletcher was under examination—I was furnishing information to Mr Freshfield while Fletcher was being cross-examined by Mr Clarkson—I swear Fletcher used the words a good job and that the word introduce was used—he could introduce me to a good job something to that purport—he had got me a good job—I mentioned that here to-day—that was the purport of what he said—I cannot exactly recollect whether I named that on my examination in chief—the words were to the purport that I should have a good job—none of the prisoners were present when I received the money from Clement Smith that I recollect—I received it in the Bank but not in the Rotunda—very probably in the Consol-office—I do not know in what office I received it Cross-examined by MR STONE Q Where was it Fletcher told you something about a job A In the Rotunda—nobody was present—I saw Barber with the lady a fortnight or three weeks after—I had never seen her before—it was an ordinary transaction which very frequently occurs—if a lady or gentleman comes and I know them I identify them—nothing occurred different to what does on other occasions—they remained in my office about five minutes while I was writing the instructions for the sale—I do not recollect speaking to her or she to me—I do not recollect seeing Lydia Saunders from that time till she was at the Mansion-house—I was aware that a person named Lydia Saunders had been taken up as the person representing Emma Slack—I do not recollect whether she was dressed the same then as on the 7th of April—I did not notice whether her veil was down when she came to make the transfer—she had a long veil—I saw it down when she came to the Bank—she was dressed in black at the Mansion-house and had a black veil—it was not by the black veil that I knew her—Mr Barber and Emma Slack walked over to the Bank arm-in-arm to the best of my recollection and I before them—I did all the work at the Accountant-General s office—we went from there to the cashiers—I think Mr Barber signed the paper there—I did not observe whether Emma Slack walked lame or not—I had no reason for noticing her—I thought it a straight-forward ordinary transaction—there was nothing to direct my attention to it further than changing 1000l note into gold—that drew my attention—I heard no reason assigned for that—it is not at all unusual to get gold for notes—I have identified a great many other persons since the 7th of April—I may have identified 300 persons without knowing them being introduced by a person I did know Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q May I ask whether your memory is pretty good A I can recollect I dare say some things better than others—I will not swear one way or other whether Mr Barber took any part in the conversation about changing the note—he must have heard it because he was present—I recollect that because it was at the time I paid him the money—that was in the Rotunda—that is not generally speaking a scene of confusion—it has been so in former times but it is not now—it was not dividend time—they were due but not payable—there were very few people there—I remember that distinctly—I was not examined at the Mansion-house—I was present four or five times—I missed some—that is correct to the best of my belief—I do not remember any other transaction on the 7th of April not on the 6th or 8th—I consider that I have had three transactions with Barber—I may have had more—I will swear I have had more than one other transaction with him—there was one on the 29th of April 1843—I sold 100l reduced for Mary Anderson where Mr Barber was the attorney—I have no recollection of his attending to that but by my book—I recollect the transaction of the 3500l without the book—I have a memorandum over the account of the name of Barber—I cannot describe Mary Anderson—I have no recollection at all of her—on the 1st of June 1842 I had a transaction with Mr Barber—it was 12 010l Consols in the name of Thomas Hunt sold—I have no recollection of that except from my book—the entries are my own—I do not recollect any other transaction with Barber Q Were Barber and Bircham the attornies A I do not know—here is only Barber s name to the power MR ERLE Q Did you see Emma Slack s features at all while you were there A Yes and when she was at the Mansion-house she was the person I had formed in my mind as Emma Slack—I saw her countenance when she was at the Bank with Barber her veil was up then—I cannot say at what part of the time that was—the only matter which drew my attention was the proposition to change the 1000l note for gold—I never recollect a woman changing so large a note for gold—when I identify strangers I rely on an introduction from parties I have done business for—I relied on Mr Barber in this case—I keep an account of transactions which take place—I should not know of selling stock on any other day for Barber except by my book—I know I have sold stock on other occasions but cannot particularize the amount or day—I only knew Hunt from the introduction I had—Hunt was a stranger introduced to me—he was the seller—the amount was 12 010l —Mr Barber introduced him to me JAMES BALLARD I am a clerk in the 3 per Cent Consols office at the Bank—I am the attesting witness to the transfer of 3500l —I saw it executed by a person who signed this Emma Slack —I have no recollection of the transaction The transfer was here read from Emma Slack of Francis-street Tottenham-court-road spinster to Charles Smith Mortimer MR PHILPOT re-examined This transfer is not signed by me but by Mr Matthews who assists in my business JOHN FRANCIS MATTHEWS I signed the name of Mr Philpot to this transfer of Emma Slack to Mortimer—I know both Smith and Mortimer—they were not there at the time CLEMENT SMITH I am a stock jobber On the 7th of April 1843 I purchased 3500l Consols of Mr Philpot for 8382l —I paid for it in Bank notes—I did not take the numbers of the notes nor the description but I have not the least doubt it would be three of 1000l and 382l in small notes—I am the same as positive there was three 1000l notes—I recollect taking four 1000l notes and to the best of my belief I paid three 1000l notes—I received the four 1000l notes from C S Mortimer—they were the only 1000l notes I had that day—I paid the other note into Prescott s the bankers to the account of Henry Smith—I did not take the particulars of that note Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q What was Philpot s commission on the sale A I have nothing to do with that—I paid him 3382l —the stock came to 3386l 5s but I had another transaction with him the same day of 125l 3 1/2 per Cent —I am quite positive as to the number of 1000l notes I had that day—I cannot exactly recollect the number or amount of the other notes—I only mark the notes—to the best of my belief I had three notes of 1000l —I have not the least idea how many I had that week nor on any day except on the 7th of April in that week unless I had my memorandums with me—I know the day of the week because I have it before me—my attention was first called to this about six weeks or two months ago—I was not examined before the Lord Mayor COURT Q Is it an unusual thing for you to have so large an amount of Bank notes as thousands A Certainly not—I am in the habit of having 5000l or 10 000l about me—I cannot remember unless I have my account with me—1000l notes frequently pass through my hands every week MR ERLE Q When your attention was drawn to this five or six weeks ago did you examine your accounts and memorandums A I did and ascertained that I had only four 1000l notes on the 7th of April and I had them from Charles Smith Mortimer—I bought the stock of Philpot and it was transferred to Mr Mortimer COURT Q What accounts are you alluding to when you say in reference to them you had four 1000l notes on the 7th of April and four only A I allude to my own accounts MR ERLE Q When your attention was drawn to this inquiry did yon examine your books and papers to see if you had more than four 1000l notes on the 7th of April A Yes—I have the account before me—I had not any so large as 1000l except the four I had from Mortimer—this is the original paper made on that day—I have kept it since—I have no description of the notes but I remember the circumstance of going to Mortimer and sending to him for these notes—after I looked at the account I remembered the circumstance—I am the same as positive that I received four 1000l notes from him—I will swear it to the best of my belief—I remember having four 1000l notes of Mr Mortimer CHARLES SMITH MORTIMER I am a member of the Stock Exchange My attention has been called to the 7th of April 1843—on that day I lent Clement Smith 3000l —I paid him notes to the amount of 4000l —I know there were four notes of 1000l each—I received two of the 1000l notes from Mr Brewer and two from White—I have not the numbers Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q Does not a great deal of money pass through your hands A Yes—I always put down in my book if notes are otherwise than 1000l —I know it because I have no entry that they were the 1000l —I do not put down 1000l —I put down the gross amount then— producing his memorandum Q Your memorandum says Mr Brewer 2000 White 2000 Bank 4000 A Yes—that shows me they were four of 1000l each—I always make a memorandum when they are otherwise than thousands—this entry of 600l were paid in a check and this 1452l was paid with a check—I received the money from Brewer on the 7th of April—the name Brewer is written over the line—that was done about a month ago—the whole memorandum except that was made at that time which was written since this inquiry—I ought to have done it at the time—I did it merely to correct my book—I never thought of looking at the book till this inquiry—I received the other two 1000l notes the same day—there is a memorandum of that EDWIN JOHN BREWER I am a member of the Stock Exchange My attention has been called to the 7th of April 1843—on that day I sold 2300l Consols to Edward Pearce for which I received two 1000l Bank notes Nos 91295 and 91767 and sundry smaller notes to make up the total—I have not the dates of the notes—I received them that day—I regret to say there is a mistake in the number of one of the notes—I have seen a note which I believe passed through my hands from marks on it but I have put one figure before another— looking at a 1000l note No 92195 —I should say this is one of the notes I had—there is Henry Mortimer on it and E P which I think are Mr Pearce s initials his own writing but I have put the 1 before the 2 in the hurry of business—I gave those two notes to Charles Smith Mortimer of the Stock Exchange for their check of 2000l Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q What memorandums are those you have been looking at A An abstract of my book devoid of technicalities—it is made from my book which is also here—I took the numbers of the notes received of Pearce at the time they were in my possession but not as regards giving them to Mortimer—I was asked some three months since by Mr Mortimer whether I had given them to him—I looked at the memorandum-book and saw I had made them up as I call it to pay into my banker s—I went to my banker s to see whether a check drawn by Mortimer was paid that day—there is nomemorandum made about that time which shows that I paid them to Mortimer—I have a recollection of it—I did pay them to him—I have since asked Jones Loyd whether I paid in a check that day from Mortimer—I certainly had doubts whether I did pay these notes on that particular day Q Are you not speaking as to your recollection of having paid these notes on that day from what you have ascertained from people since A I have the numbers down and there is Pearce s initials and Mr Mortimer s name on the notes—I paid Mortimer that day two 1000l notes for their check and the numbers agree Q Are you not speaking of what you paid that day from information you have since acquired A Yes—I put the name of the person I paid to here long subsequent to the 7th of April—I put the date here the day I paid it—the memorandum was made from information I received long after the 7th of April—the note before me is the one which does not agree in the number—there is nothing in this one from which I will swear it was in my possession on the 7th of April—I would rather not swear to it the number being wrong MR ERLE Q Turn to the entry you made at the time 7th of April can you say whether you had two 1000l notes A I had—I entered the name of the person I received them from—I have the initials of E Pearce on it—I think this E P is his writing—I believe the E P on the note No 92195 to be Pearce s writing—I did not observe that on them when in my possession MR MORTIMER re-examined The name of Mortimer on these notes it not the writing of myself or brother it looks like Smith s writing CLEMENT SMITH re-examined The name of Mortimer on this note No 92195 and No 91767 are my son s writing—he puts the names of persons I have notes from on them—he is living THOMAS PHILLIPS I am a clerk in the Accountant s-office at the Bank of England I have searched the Bank books to ascertain whether such a 1000l note as No 91295 was in circulation on the 7th of April 1848—it was not in circulation—it was paid in on the 4th of April Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q How do you ascertain that it was paid in on the 4th of April A By our ledger—it would be received by a clerk and posted in the proper office—I never remember a mistake in the Bank books as to the day a note came in—there have been mistakes as to the numbers of notes but they are rectified the same day BENJAMIN HORNBY I am clerk at Messrs Prescott s bank On the 7th of April 1843 1000l note was paid into their house to the credit of Henry—it was No 91491 dated Feb 1 1843 JOHN MILLER I am a pay clerk in the Bank of England On the 8th of April I exchanged a lot of Bank notes to the value of 1580l for gold—I have my book here—the clerk who took the notes from me comes from another office—they are marked by the inspector—I do not put a mark on them HENRY VENDISH LEIGHTON I am a clerk in the Bank On the 8th of April I have entered some notes to the amount of 1530l as being cashed—I received them from John Miller—among them was one for 1000l —I did not take the number or date—I entered the name at the back which was Slack—if a bundle of notes are brought to me I enter the numbers of the first and last note not the intermediate ones—the intermediate ones are identified by a number printed on them—the No 401 is printed on these—this 1000l note No 91767 was in the bundle I took that day—I know it by a mark on the outside—I received them from Miller be cashed them and took an account of them—the number is entered in my book—it was paid for gold—Miller pays nothing but gold Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q How many are there besides Miller in that department A I do not know a great many—I was never so employed COURT Q Are you enabled to say confidently that the bundle of notes for 1530l came from Miller A Quite confident— the indorsement on the bundle of notes was Miss Slack Francis-street Tottenham-court-road MR STONE Q Did you observe this address on it when delivered to you A Yes I have written that in the book against it—it is the last note JOSEPH DERMER I am a clerk in the Tellers office On the 10th of April I exchanged for gold a 1000l note in the name of Slack—I do not take the number or date but hand the notes forward—my entry is Slack 1000l for which I gave 500 sovereigns and a ticket for a 500l note—we require a name to be put on a note before it is paid and I put that name in the book—the entry shows there was such a payment made to a person named E Slack Cross-examined by MR STONE Q Who did you pay it to A I do not know—the book does not tell whether it was man or woman Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q The entry is Slack alone A Yes—on the ticket for the note is E Slack —it is a copy from the note—the name was on the note before it was brought to me—that was on the note for which I gave 500 sovereigns and a ticket for a 500l note ROBERT HYETT I am a clerk in the Bank On the 10th of April I re­ceived 1000l from Dermer which he had cashed for 500 sovereigns and a 5002 note—I took down the number of the note which I got from Dermer—it was 92195 dated the 1st of Feb WILLIAM TAYLOR I am assistant pay clerk in the Bank of England On the 10th of April 1843 1 had a ticket for a 500l notes in the name of E Slack drawn by Dermer—the number of the note I gave for it was 41856 dated the 2nd of Jan 1843—I received the ticket entered and posted it—my partner gave the note JOHN WILLIAMS I am a clerk in the Bank I gave the 500l note mentioned by Taylor for this ticket to some person in the name of Slack No 41856 who to I cannot say FREDERICK NELSON I received a bundle of notes which had been paid in gold on the 18th of April 1843 from Dermer—I gave them to Vansommer to be entered Cross-examined by MR STONE Q What quantity was it A I cannot say how many JOHN VANSOMMER I am a clerk in the Bank On the 18th of April I had a 500l note No 41856 dated the 2nd of Jan 1843—it was in the Bank that day JOSEPH DERMER That note was exchanged by me for gold on the 18th of April—I have the name of Slack 500l —it was only one note I am sure Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q IS your department confined exclusively to giving gold A Gold and silver—I may sometimes give as much as 5000l or 10 000l in gold in one lot to a banker—a great many country people take gold in various amounts EDWARD GRATTAN I am a clerk in the Southwark branch of the London and Westminster Bank I have known Fletcher about four years—he keeps an account there—I am well acquainted with his writing—the name Emma Slack 7 Francis-street Tottenham-court-road on this 500l note is his writing also the same name and address on this 1000l note No 92195 and on this 1000l note No 91492—on the 10th of April 1843 500l in gold was paid in by Fletcher in person to the credit of his deposit account—on the 18th of April 1843 480l in gold and 20l in notes making 500l was paid in by Fletcher in person and placed to his account—on the 13th of April 1843 1000l in gold was paid in to his credit on his deposit account by Fletcher in person JOHN MILLER re-examined On the 13th of April I cashed a 1000l note with 1000 sovereigns—I do not know the number of the note FREDERICK NELSON re-examined I received the note from Miller and handed it to Vansommer—I received a parcel of notes from the witness and handed the whole to Vansommer—they were all paid notes—I cannot give the numbers JOHN VANSOMMER re-examined On the 13th April the 1000l note in the name of Slack cashed by Miller was 91492 1 Feb —this is the note MR GREAVES to MR GRATTAN Q How long has Fletcher kept an account with you A Since Dec 1838 Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q I believe he kept a very respectable account A He did not keep a large account—he kept a respectable one Several letters were here put into the witness s hands some of which he identified as Fletcher s handwriting but none of them were read GEORGE GORSUCH I am at present shopman in the employ of Messrs Halling Pearce and Stone On the 29th March 1843 I went into the employ of Mr and Mrs Dorey in Oxford-street and continued there three weeks—Mr Dorey s name is Josiah and he is the husband of the prisoner—on Friday the 7th April 1843 Lydia Saunders who is Mrs Dorey s sister came to the house in a cab in company of Mrs Dorey towards the latter part of the day—I believe after five o clock—she had on a blue and black cloth check cloak and a black velvet bonnet—the cloak was not taken off in my presence—she staid till the following Monday—the morning after she arrived Mr Dorey showed me a 1000l note in the shop over the counter as a curiosity not seen every day—Mrs Dorey and Mrs Saunders were not present—shortly after Mr Dorey had shown me the note Mrs Saunders came into the shop from up stairs passed through it and went in an omnibus towards the City—it was in the early part of the morning—I should say ten or it might be eleven o clock—I saw her take the omnibus—she returned it might be two hours afterwards—I really cannot say—I noticed that she brought back with her what I considered to be a canvas bag which I judged from the sound contained gold—I should say about the space containing a thousand sovereigns from what I have seen in-silver—after Mrs Saunders came back she looked out several articles I believe to take away—there was a particular dress which she mentioned was for her daughter—it was a striped silk—a shawl and some other articles were selected at the same time—I heard Mrs Saunders tell Mr Dorey that she was going to Bristol on the Monday—that was in the shop before she left—during the time I was in Mrs Dorey s employ I had an opportunity of seeing her write and becoming acquainted with her handwriting—I believe the name Miss Slack 7 Francis-street Tottenham-court-road on this note No 91767 to be the handwriting of Mrs Dorey— looking at a gown produced by Daniel Forrester —this is the same pattern and colour as was purchased by Mrs Saunders for her daughter—at that time there might have been one thousand yards of it Cross-examined by MR STONE Q Did you reside in the house with Mr Dorey A Yes I lived with him—I had never seen Mrs Saunders before the 7th of April—she was not introduced to me at the time she came into the house—she was the first time I went into the house from the shop the same day she came after five o clock she was introduced to me as Mrs Dorey s sister from Bristol—Mr Dorey had informed me before she came to the house that Mrs Dorey s sister was coming to see them from Bristol—I am not aware how long Mr Dorey had been married—I believe from his statement about a month or six weeks—I was not with him at the time he was married—Mrs Saunders did not take off her bonnet in the shop—I noticed afterwards that she was dressed in black—she was in black during the whole time she was there—I noticed a something I thought an imperfection in her walk—that she did not walk quite firm—it might be she had corns—I did not breakfast with her on the next morning—I saw her on the 8th—I dined with her—she was there as far as I could judge on a visit to her sister—I did not breakfast or dine with her on the Monday—it is the custom in small houses of that description for the assistants to dine at a separate table from the employers—that was the custom there—I saw her on the Monday morning before twelve—it might be half-past nine ten eleven or half-past eleven—I believe it to be soon after nine—I generally got into the shop rather before eight—I am not aware that I saw her on the Saturday before I saw her pass through the shop—that was in less than half an hour after Mr Dorey showed me the note—he attended in the shop himself—I cannot recollect whether Mrs Dorey went out that day—I saw her in the shop on the Saturday but I cannot recollect whether she went out—Mrs Saunders got into the omnibus at the door—I did not hear what she said—she only got into the omnibus and went away—she returned in less than two hours—I cannot state the time—I have no recollection whether I saw Mrs Dorey from the time Mrs Saunders left until she returned—Mrs Saunders merely passed through the shop on her return—I had an opportunity of looking at the bag in her hand as she passed—I cannot say whether she had a cloak on—I believe she had—I was behind the counter—I cannot say what I was about—I was perfectly disengaged—she merely walked straight through—I cannot say which hand the bag was in—I left Mr Dorey of my own accord because it did not answer my expectations—it does not at all concern this case—I had no misunderstanding or dispute with Mr or Mrs Dorey—it was on the Saturday that Mrs Saunders looked out some articles in the shop—I am not aware whether it was before or after she went out—I believe it was after—I swear I was not dismissed from the service—I left on the 19th April 1843—I cannot recollect what passed that induced me to go—goods were looked out three or four times while Mrs Saunders was there—they were looked out also on the Monday—I understood she was to leave on the Monday by the two o clock train—I saw her leave about one or half-past—it was about the middle of the day—I never saw any bag in her possession except at the time she passed through the shop MR ERLE Q Did you see her at all except in the shop and when you were dining with her A Yes I saw her in the shop and when I was dining with her—she lived up stairs with the family—when she came back with the bag she went up stairs to the apartment of the family—I judged the bag to be a canvas one—I saw it—it was the colour of a canvas bag and the sound I judged to be gold—I repeatedly saw her while she was in the house conversed with her at times and became acquainted with her MR STONE Q Might it not have been a carpet bag the had A Oh no I am sure of that—I should think it was about that size about a foot the shape a bag generally is—bags with gold are not generally very deep—I have no recollection of the depth more than I thought it was a bag containing gold of the usual size such as a cash-bag—I have seen bags given at bankers —I believe it was not yellow—it was a lighter colour—I cannot swear to the colour MR ERLE Q Have you seen such bags as that for money A I have ELIZA ROSSER I am now living as servant with Mr Taplin a solicitor—I have been living with him little more than ten months—before that I was living with Mr and Mrs Saunders—they carried on business as fishmongers at Bristol—I think about eight days elapsed between the time of my leaving Mr Saunders and going to Mr Taplin s—I left Mr Saunders because I thought I could better myself—they gave me a month s-warning—before Mrs Saunders gave me warning she had been in London for about two months—I should suppose she gave me warning about a week after she came back—I cannot exactly say—she brought back with her three silk dresses—they were not made up looking at the silk dress produced by Forrester —I cannot say that is the silk dress—I think that has been washed—she brought home something similar to this but I cannot say—it was such a pattern as this appears to be—I cannot speak to it—she brought three dresses for herself and two daughters—one of those daughters was living with Bucknell and Spark drapers at College-green Bristol—during the time Mrs Saunders was in town Mr Saunders left Bristol for a few days—he went at the latter part of the week and came back at the beginning of the next week—Mrs Saunders returned to Bristol about a week after that time—he came back by himself a week before her—I never saw Mrs Dorey but once—she was at Bristol for about six weeks staying with Mrs Saunders—that was I should say a month before Mrs Saunders went to London—I cannot say exactly Cross-examined by MR STONE Q Are they not carrying on business in a very large way in Bristol as fish dealers A Yes one of the largest fish shops in Bristol—Mr Saunders was not frequently from home while I was there—I cannot say how often he was away—he might corns to London and stay one night and return next day once in a month or six weeks—he has not been away for a month or three weeks to my knowledge—while Mrs Saunders was away he was at home attending to the business during the whole of that two months except that short time—I do not know whether Mrs Dorey was married when she was at Bristol—she was called Mrs Dorey but I do not know whether she was so or not Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Do you know Mr Saunders s writing A No I have seen him write but I never took any notice of it and I should not know it again—I cannot write or read writing—I do not know whether Mrs Saunders was at Bath in Jan —I do not know of her going to Bath—she was not away from home except when she went to London—I do not recollect it—I will not swear it—Mrs Saunders had a blue and black plaid cloak made to go to London in—I do not know in what month she went away to go to London—it was in the winter season—Mrs Dorey had left before that—I cannot say that I ever saw Fletcher there—I do not know him—as far as I know I have never seen him EDWARD GILL I am a clerk in the bank of Messrs Stuckey and Co of Bristol The prisoner William Saunders had an account there—it was opened in Sept 1842—he has an account with us now—since he opened it he has frequently been in the habit of bringing money to pay in to his account—be has generally brought cash notes and gold—he once brought a large quantity of gold—that was on the 5th of Sept 1843 he brought 1000 sovereigns—I said to him on that occasion Really Mr Saunders it appears as if there was a mint in your house —I am not aware that he made any reply—he had before that brought in thirty or forty sovereigns at a time perhaps less and sometimes more at different times during the summer—I noticed that some of them were new because I made the observation at the time that I wished other customers brought in such nice gold as he did—I apply that not to the 1000l but to former credits—to the best of my belief all the 1000 sovereigns paid in on the 5th of Sept were new Cross-examined by MR PHINN Q Were you at the counter yourself receiving the money A I was the cashier—the whole amount paid in that day was 1040l 11s 6d of which 1000l was in sovereigns—I am quite sure—I made the entry at the time—I have it here—it is in my handwriting Cross-examined by MR GREAVES Q Just look at that note 1000l No 92195 do you know that handwriting at the top A Yes—I do not know Fletcher s handwriting—I should say this is Mr Saunders s handwriting—I believe it is—I should say the handwriting on this 500l note No 41856 is written by the same person—I believe the endorsement on this note No 91492 is written by the same party—I am well acquainted with Mr Saun­ders s handwriting by seeing his checks Cross-examined by MR STONE Q Did you ever see him write in your life A Yes credit tickets—I have never seen him write checks— looking at the notes again —these do resemble Saunders s handwriting—I saw them in Bristol—they were shown to me by Mr Weir—I do not exactly recollect the date—I told him I believed them to be Mr Saunders s writing—I do not re­collect the reply he made Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Look at this writing without turning it over especially these two words Miss Slack and tell me whose writing you believe it to be A Looking at it indiscriminately I should say it was Mr Saunders s writing—I do not know Mrs Saunders s writing MR ERLE Q YOU saw Mr Weir at Bristol was that at the time an examination was going on about some notes that had been obtained A Yes—Mr Weir showed me certain notes and asked me if I knew the writing—the name written on the top I believed to be Saunders s writing on com­paring it with some of Mr Saunders s— looking at some others —I believe this to be Mr Saunders s writing—I did not know what case Mr Weir was inquiring about—I know I saw a letter signed by Hunt—the name Thomas Hunt on these notes I believe is in Saunders s writing—this is the letter I saw—it is signed Thomas Hunt—I believe the notes Mr Weir showed me then had Thomas Hunt endorsed on them those were the notes I believed to be endorsed in the handwriting of Saunders and these I believe are in the handwriting of Saunders judging from his other writing—I have seen these notes endorsed Emma Slack before and I believe it is William Saunders s writing by the resemblance to his hand­writing—there are two for 1000l and one for 500l DANIEL FORRESTER I was first employed in this case in respect of Mrs Dorey—I went with Miss Neville to Oxford-street about the 4th or 5th of Jan —I went to Bristol to see for Mrs Saunders—I did not find her there—I understood she was not there—I did not apprehend her—I got this dress from the daughter at the house of Bucknell and Spark linen-drapers College-green where she was living—she gave it me—I had been there before and asked for Miss Saunders and she had spoken to me on a previous occasion—they stated she was up stairs and she was fetched down—I went to Mr Barber s office and among other things found this certificate of the death of Ann Slack on a table there—it was handed to me by Mr Bircham with a parcel of other papers—I cannot say exactly that I saw it on the table but it was passed to me with other papers—no doubt they were on the table—I went to Bristol again in Feb —I made all the search I could there and in the neighbourhood to find the Saunders s but could not find them or hear of their having been there for some time—my earliest visit was in Jan Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q You found I believe a great many papers at Mr Barber s office A Yes—Mr Barber had not been in custody perhaps an hour when I went there—I left a great many papers behind—all the papers I produce were found in his office—the papers connected with Slack s transactions were tied up together with an inscription on the back stating that they referred to Slack—I think this paper Re Slack probate of the will of Ann Slack spinster deceased was the outside one—I do not know Mr Bircham s writing—I had been set to watch Mr Barber s movements for some time before I went to his office—I cannot charge my memory with the length of time—I think it might have been the middle of Nov to the best of my recollection—he was arrested on the 9th of Dec —I had seen him go to his office during that time I will not say most days—I was not there every day myself—I think I did not see him come to his office at the most six times—I was not there always of a morning I sent some one else—that person is not here—I took away from Mr Barber s office his diary of 1843—I handed it to Mr Freshfield by Mr Barber s wish—I forget now exactly whether it was Mr Giddy or Mr Barber—Mr Giddy was the solicitor for Mr Barber in the first instance I believe—I did not hand to Mr Freshfield all the papers I seized—I handed some to Mr Weir since I have been here—yesterday I think it was—I do not know of any application being made to me to let Mr Barber have copies of those papers—there had been an application on the part of Mr Giddy to the best of my belief at the beginning to inspect those papers which he did and saw them—no application has been made to me for copies of those papers nor in my hearing—I have not seen Mr Barber with a tearful eye ask for them—I do not recollect that I ever heard him ask for them—I gave a great many papers up to Mr Giddy which I took to the Compter to Mr Barber and to the best of my recollection I offered them to Mr Barber and he refused to take them—I then went into the other office and gave them to Mr Giddy—I think I have had about ten papers of Mr Barber s in my possession—Mr Freshfield and Mr Weir knew I had them—they have inspected them—I have been to Mr Freshfield s office a great many times during the last month—I had not those papers in my possession when I went there—I kept some of them at the Mansion-house and one relating to Slack s matter I kept at home—I gave it up yesterday—I took from Mr Barber s person his pocket-book keys and everything he had and they were returned to him shortly after—they were kept for several days—the keys enabled me to open drawers at Mr Barber s—I do not recollect a desk—I ransacked every place in the office that was accessible—I ransacked his cash-box—I have been making every possible inquiry about Mr Barber wherever I could—I do not think I went to his residence in Nelson-square—I do not know whether I did or not—I cannot charge my memory whether I went to the door but I never went into the place to search it MR ERLE Q As to this searching the drawers and cash-box was the partner Mr Bircham by all the time you did that A Yes he was there the whole time I searched—there was also another person in the office but whether he was a clerk or not I do not know—I think his name was Price—it is usual to search persons apprehended for felony and take articles from them—the paper I kept at home was this certificate—the papers I handed to Mr Freshfield were what either Mr Barber or Mr Giddy desired me to hand for their inspection—I know Mr Giddy inspected the papers I had which I produced here yesterday—as far as I know he inspected them—he has applied for no copies to me—I gave up to Mr Barber and Mr Giddy those which they had not requested me to hand to Mr Freshfield—I think it was within a week after Mr Barber was apprehended—I do not exactly recollect the date MR WILKINS Q Where did you get that blue cheek cloak A From the house of Mrs Dorey ELIZA ROSSER re-examined by MR WILKINS This cloak is the same pattern as Mrs Saunders s cloak which she took to London with her MR ERLE Q Did you see when Mrs Dorey was down on a visit there whether she had a cloak with her A No Mrs Dorey had a cloak made up of the same pattern JOHN FORRESTER I was employed to endeavour to apprehend the Saunder s—I did not find them at Bristol—my brother had been there—I arrived in Edinburgh on the 11th of March and on the 13th I took Mr Saunders into custody at Edinburgh and on the 20th I took Mrs Saunders also at Edinburgh—Mr Saunders came to a shop and was apprehended in the street not by me—I gave instructions that if he came there he should be taken into custody—I was not present when Mrs Saunders was taken—I was in Edinburgh at the time—I saw them there—I saw him on the 13th and her on the 20th and took them into custody JAMES GUDGE I am clerk of the Journals in the House of Commons The Right Hon Charles Shaw Lefevre is the Speaker JAMES WILLIAM FRESHFIELD Esq I am the solicitor to the Bank In consequence of the inquiry about Ann Slack s will on the 15th of Nov I called on the prisoner Barber—I told him that I came from the Bank—I made this memorandum at the time MR WILKINS Q Do you mean you made it in Mr Barber s presence A No immediately after my return home MR ERLE Q You said you came from the Bank of England A Yes in reference to a sum of stock which had been transferred from the name of Miss Ann Slack under a will which appeared to have been proved by Mr Barber and which was irregular—he said that he remembered the transaction— I am giving it now as written —that Miss Slack came to him with the will which was quite regular that the property was mentioned in the will that she stated that her aunt had died about six weeks before that he got the will proved and got her the money which was all that he knew of the busi­ness—I asked him who the lady was— I meant the Miss Slack living —he said she resided in some street out of Holborn that she was a most respectable person and he had no doubt the transaction was all right—I asked him if she was introduced and by whom—he said yes he had no doubt she was but he did not recollect by whom that he would endeavour to recall the fact but to him it was a mere matter of business and he knew nothing more of it—I told him that was quite inconsistent with the fact that he had himself been in communication with Captain Foskett some months before the alleged death of Miss Ann Slack respecting this very property—he said at first that he had certainly had some communication with Captain Foskett but not he thought respecting this property—he could not recollect—he spoke hesitatingly—I told him that his letters were distinctly respecting a property of Miss Ann Slack—after some hesitation he said it might be to that be would not deny it but that it was a mere matter of business and he did not feel authorized in disclosing the affairs of his clients—I told him that I did not wish him to tell me more than he chose that I should not at all press him but it was necessary I should apprize him that a fraud and forgery had been committed and that he was gravely implicated in the transaction by the fact that he had been inquiring and negociating respecting this very property six months before the alleged death of Miss Ann Slack and before the right of his client accrued and that I desired to knew under what circumstances he had so negociated—he said he supposed he could tell and he would endeavour to recollect—that Miss Slack was a most respectable woman and that he had no doubt it was all right—I told him that was beside the question which was how he came to be interfering six months before he saw her—he said that he did not know that he could tell or ought to tell but he would refresh his memory and he wished me to look at his books that I might see it was only a matter of business with him—he then produced the probate his ledger and an account-book which he opened—there was an entry in the ledger of 90l odd for the proctor s bill and 15l odd for hit attendance—he laid that was all he got out of the transaction that his bill as cast amounted to 18l odd and Miss Slack made it 15l —the book showed the produce of the stock 4500l odd on one side and was signed Emma Slack —she had signed his book—I do not remember which of the books that was in—the entry was only signed in one at recognising or proving the account—I then told him that was not the question upon which he said he would endeavour to refresh his memory and if I would call on a future occasion he would let me know the result—I told him that his character was implicated that I desired to give him an opportunity to explain if he pleased but that did not intend to press him at all—that I should report the case to the Treasury who would no doubt prosecute the case and that if he chose to tend me an explanation I would report that also but that I could not delay COURT Q Have you any doubt that matter to that effect did pass between you have you a recollection of it independent of the paper A I have a distinct recollection of the whole of it without the paper but I of course speak with more particularity from having taken it down at the moment MR ERLE Q From that time till after Mr Barber was apprehended did he ever communicate to you that Fletcher had introduced Mitt Slack A He did not—I had no communication from him whatever from that moment till he was apprehended Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Put that paper aside and repeat to the Jury what you have said A His Lordship will probably allow me to refer to my notes—I have no doubt I could give you a correct account of the transaction without the paper but there would be variances in words and it was for that express object I took it down on paper COURT Q Are you enabled to give an account A I am enabled to give an account of the transaction as it is stated here—I could give the account without this paper but there would undoubtedly be variances of words and variances of expressions MR WILKINS Q That it exactly what I want A I took this down at the time correctly—I put it down after my return home about an hour after it happened—I decline to state what took place without the paper unless you wish me—I swear the conversation took place in the order in which I have read it—Mr Barber expressed an angry feeling—it hardly amounted to an angry feeling but he said I hardly understand in what character you put these questions —he spoke in a mild tone of voice COURT Q Y ou did not mention that I think A No I did not—it was then I told him what is here—he said that on the occasion of my pressing him with the fact that he had been negociating on the subject of this property six months before his client had come to him—it was in reference to that—I put that point strongly MR WILKINS Q Pray had you forgotten that when you made that memorandum A I had not—I have stated the substance of what passed Q Was it wilfully omitted yes or no A It was wilfully omitted—he did not express indignation more than once—I do not think he said he must decline furnishing me with the name of his informant for the present—I will swear he did not—he did not say I think at the present time I ought not to mention his name —I swear he said nothing of the kind—I have a sufficient recollection of the whole of the conversation to swear he did not say that Q Why then decline to tell what did take place without your paper A Because having taken down what did pass for the purpose of accuracy I decline to run the risk of stating it inaccurately—I read it over at the time once or twice and subsequently I have not read it over at all until yesterday I think—I have probably read it over three or four times altogether—I will not swear I have not read it over six times altogether—I had occasion to explain it to a great number of persons immediately after the occurrence and I may have read it over six times—I was not required to attend at the Mansion-house the business devolved on my brother—I did not think it necessary—I have never given this information on oath before to-day—the notes I have read were the very notes I made handing them to Mr Wilkins —this Mr James F s memoranda is Mr Weir s writing it has been put among the papers relating to this prosecution—Mr Barber did not show me his diary—I will swear he did not offer to do so—Mr Weir is our clerk—I did not instruct Forrester to watch Mr Barber s office nor give instructions for it—I think I never heard of it—I am not conscious of having heard of the fact—I certainly gave no such instructions and am not aware that such instructions were given——it was about three weeks after this that Mr Barber was apprehended—Mr Barber said if I would call in three or four days he should be happy to give me information—I did not call MR ERLE Q What was it he said about the information just look to your memoranda as to that A If I would call on a future occasion he would let us know the result—I told him I could not call again—I told him that I meant to go to the Treasury immediately and report the case COURT Q Are you sure you said you would not call again A Yes—I said if he chose to send me any explanation I would report that also but I could not delay it MR WILKINS Q Then you did not say that you would not call again A I do not think I made use of those words—Mr Barber produced two books and I really do not speak positively in which it was I saw the entry of 90l odd and 15l —I will swear I saw it in some book MR ERLE Q Did you take any part in getting up this case A None whatever—I reported the case to the Treasury two days after this interview and have taken no further part in the case—my brother and Mr Weir my clerk have been concerned in it—I had this interview with Mr Barber at his own office in Bridge-street—I went to him immediately after having seen Miss Slack at the Bank—this prosecution is by the Treasury—I had no further concern in it on the part of the Bank than to report it to the Treasury MR SAMUEL ROBERT GOODMAN I am the chief clerk at the Mansion House I was there when the prisoner Barber was first brought up when the will was produced and Miss Slack and the proctor Mr Wills were examined—after they had been examined Mr Barber applied to be discharged on bail—Mr Clarkson said that further evidence would be brought forward and upon that the Lord Mayor declined taking bail—Mr Clarkson asked if Mr Fletcher was in the room and no answer was given to him by any person—a short time elapsed and some communication was made by some person whom I did not know at that time and whom I should not recognise now and Mr Barber then spoke to a party in the room who afterwards turned out to be Mr Fletcher Q How soon after A Immediately afterwards—Mr Barber then made a statement to the Lord Mayor which I took down in writing and after he had made his statement he then called Mr Fletcher as his witness Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Do you remember Mr Barber ex­amining Mr Fletcher A I do and also his cross-examining Miss Slack—I have a copy of that cross-examination—it is some length—it runs four pages in my book MR ERLE Q You say he called Mr Fletcher as his witness was that after the Lord Mayor had refused to bail him A Certainly—he spoke to Fletcher before he called him—the proceedings were kept waiting I should say a quarter of an hour whilst he was in conversation with Mr Fletcher in the same room The will was here read dated 3rd June 1842 it purported to be the last will and testament of Ann Slack formerly of Smith-street Chelsea spinster but then of South-terrace Pimlico and bequeathed to Emma Slack her niece 3500l three per cent Consols standing in her name in the Bank of England with all other property she might possess and appointing her sole executrix The affidavit for probate was dated 16th March 1843 and was to the effect that the deponent Emma Slack of No 7 Francis-street Tottenham Court-road spinster was the sole executrix named in the last will and testament of said Ann Slack late of South-terrace Pimlico Middlesex spinster who died on or about the 17th of Feb 1843 and declaring her effects to be under 5000l The power of attorney granted by Miss Slack to Aderne Hulme Esq to receive her dividends on the Three per Cents was also read Adjourned Thursday 15th April 1844 THE QUEEN AGAINST BARBER AND OTHERS CONTINUED WILLIAM CHRISTMAS re-examined I never mentioned to anybody but Fletcher about there being any unclaimed dividends in the case of Slack WILLIAM OBADIAH WHEELER re-examined I am a clerk in the Bank Mr Barber kept an account there up to the time of his apprehension—I think the account began in 1839 or 1840—there was a private account of his and a joint account of Barber and Bircham DANIEL FORRESTER re-examined I went to Bristol to look after Mrs Saunders—I found the business of a fishmonger carrying on there—the name of Saunders was up at the place—I looked for her—I searched there for the husband as well as her—the business was still carried on by a young man about twenty who was stated to be the son and a young lady about sixteen went over the house with me—I took her for the daughter MR ERLE Q Could you get from them where the mother and father were A They stated they did not know MR JAMES here applied on behalf of the prisoner Dorey to be allowed to withdraw her plea and plead guilty which was accordingly done John Hutchinson

COUNTS varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution THOMAS EVISON I am a cashier in the house of Smith Payne and Smith bankers in Lombard-street Mr Abel Smith is the principal partner and there are others On the 9th of Jan last this check was presented at the counter to me I have no recollection by whom—I do not know whether it was a male a female or a child I did not take any notice—Lady Nelthorpe keeps an account at our banking-house—this purports to be signed M Nelthorpe —nothing attracted my attention to it—I paid for it three 50l Bank of England notes one of which was No 75950 dated the 6th of July 1843 and eight 5l notes Nos 64251 to 58 inclusive dated the 13th of Nov 1843 LADY MARGARET NELTHORPE I am the widow of Sir Henry Nelthorpe Bart and reside at River-hill Kent In the latter end of 1842 I was in London—the female prisoner was introduced to me in October that year—she was desirous of becoming a companion to me—no arrangement of that sort was come to—I invited her to stay at my house and she came—she remained with me from about the 10th of Oct to the 21st of Nov or thereabouts as an inmate—after that she was in the habit of coming to my house as long as I remained in town—I understood from her that she was in very distressed circumstances and she applied to me to lend her 5s for an advertisement just before she left—during the time she was with me she had many times the opportunity of noticing my handwriting—I have heard her say that she could imitate any person s handwriting—whilst she was with me I had a banking account at Smith Payne and Smith s of London—she had an opportunity of knowing that—I cannot swear that she did know it but I have no doubt she did—at this moment I cannot call my recollection with any certainty about it—I was in the habit of drawing checks on that house while she was with me—she generally sat in the same room that I did—I was in the habit of writing my checks upon engraved bank checks—that was not always the case I have written upon plain paper and signed it but that was not Pay the bearer —the check produced is not my handwriting nor was it written by my authority—it is very much like my signature—I have never had any communication with or from the female prisoner since Dec 1842 Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q I think you say the generality of the checks you signed were engraved checks A They were—I could not swear that I ever signed a check in the prisoner s presence—I might possibly sign a written check two or three times in the course of a year not more MR BODKIN Q You do not remember any particular occasion on which the female prisoner was present when you signed a check A I do not particularly remember—she may have seen me sign many—I do not remember positively one way or the other whether any of my checks have been under her notice ELIZABETH MASON I am a widow and live at No 17 Ranelagh-grove Pimlico—the two prisoners came to lodge at my house about September last—they lived there as man and wife and passed as Mr and Mrs Francis—they left about the 22nd or 23rd of February I cannot say to a day—it was the latter part of Feb —this is a bill for two weeks rent and various items of expenditure at my house—it is the female prisoner s writing—she settled with me—I cannot say that she settled with me on the day this was made out—the rent became due on the Thursday but I really cannot say what date—this was written on the same day she paid me the rent—it is dated the 11th of Jan 1844—I cannot say what she gave me in payment—I cannot say whether it was then that 1 took a 5l note or not—I received a 5l note one time for rent—I cannot say whether that was after this bill was made out—I do not know at what time it was—I did not receive more than one 5l note from her—I cannot tell whether that was before that bill was made out or after—it was for rent and money laid out—Brown paid it me and I paid it to young Mr Cafe for my rent—I cannot say on what day it was when he came for the rent—it might be three weeks or a month after I received it from Brown but I cannot say—I know I paid Mr Cafe the note I received from her because I had no other—before she paid it me she had said she was about receiving some money at the beginning of the year COURT Q Did they pay the rent weekly or how A Weekly—it was never in arrear but once and that was through my being out—I cannot say when that was—it was before this and once when my husband was lying dead—that made twice I believe—he died on the 14tb of Feb last—I cannot say whether this was one of the occasions when it was a week in arrear—it might be so—it was before the rent was in arrear that she told me she was going to take some money at the beginning of the year—it might be before Christmas—I cannot say when it was at the latter part of the year Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Can you read writing A Yes—I do not think I ever receipted this bill—this receipt was written by Miss Brown—the 5l note was given to me before my husband s death—I am sure of that—it was not at the time he was lying dead it was before he was taken ill—he was taken on the Monday evening and died on the Wednesday evening—they always conducted themselves very respectable at my house nobody more so HENRY HAMILTON CAFE I am the son of Mr Cafe the auctioneer—I collect the rent of the house in which Mrs Mason lives—I received the rent due at Christmas from her on the 7th of March last—it was 9l 10s —I received this 5l note No 64253 from her in part payment—I find my handwriting upon it Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q When was that mark placed on it by you A I do not recollect whether I placed it on immediately on receiving it or when I got home but I received no other note that day—I am quite sure of that and that I marked it on that day THOMAS EVISON re—examined The notes I delivered to the party presenting the check I should infer were new ones by their being consecutive numbers just from the Bank perhaps that very morning—I should think they had not been before issued to the public by their being consecutive numbers—that is the way in which they come to our house from the Bank—we pay other notes besides those we receive from the Bank of England those paid in by customers—customers very often pay them in rolls SUSAN LUFF I am a milliner and live in Regent—street I know the female prisoner—I have received letters from her at the latter part of 1842—I have afterwards seen her on the subject of those letters and spoken with her about it—I believe this check to be her handwriting Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Did you ever see her write A Never—I do not think I ever conversed with her on the subject of more than one letter—this check has been shown to me before—I do not know whether a letter was put into my hands to look at before that—a letter was put into my hands by Mr Bush—I cannot remember whether he requested me to compare the letter and the check together—the letter was put into my hand to look at the handwriting—I do not know why—I was not asked the question—Mrs Mason s bill was not put into my hands—I saw it at the examination—I have received more than two letter from Miss Brown—I think four—three I am positive of—I preserved some of them—I have not got them now—if I had seen this check in another part of town without mention of her name and without reference to this transaction I do not know that I should have had any notion whose writing it was—I do not think any other documents were shown to me by Mr Bush—I cannot remember whether I compared the check with the letter Mr Bush showed me—I cannot remember whether I saw the two together or separately—It was at Bow—street about six weeks or two months ago—they were shown to me before went in be-fore the Magistrate—I do not think any one was present besides Mr Bush—the last letter I received from Miss Brown was in 1842 while she was staying with Lady Nelthorpe—I do not know that I examined the check and the letter together—I have said that I did not remember whether I saw them together or separately JAMES HUME baker St Michael s-place Brompton I know Mrs Fredericks the mother of the prisoner Francis—she lives in Michael s-grove near me—this 5l note No 64258 has the name of Fredericks written on it by me—I cannot tell of whom I received it—I wrote the name of Fredericks on it because it came from their house by one of themselves—it was my habit if a person came from Fredericks house to write that name—I should not do so for an entire stranger—this 50l note No 75950 has also the name of Fredericks on it in my own handwriting Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Mrs Fredericks is a lady whom you supply with bread A Yes—she has lived there some three or four years—they are a very respectable family and well connected—she has other sons besides Mr Francis—they are gentlemen in the army—I believe the prisoner is in the army—Mrs Fredericks has married a second husband—her name was Francis—the prisoner is her son by her former husband SOPHIA ANN NEIRN I am cook in the service of Mrs Fredericks of Brompton I went into her service last Nov —I remember changing a 5l note at Mr Hume s—I cannot say when it was—I changed two 5l notes altogether and no more—Mr Francis the prisoner gave me both of them to change at separate times—I do not know who changed them for me at Mr Hume s—I gave the change to Mr Francis—he was then at his mother s house—he was in the habit of coming there at times Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q How long have you lived with Mrs Fredericks A Since the 29th of Oct —she has two servants and a gardener—she has two grown-up daughters by her first husband living with her—Mr Francis used to come there sometimes—sometimes he slept there and sometimes not JAMES HUMS re-examined Only Mrs Hume and myself give change—whoever gives change generally writes on the note the name of the person giving it—my wife is not here—she is very well JAMES BIRD I live at No 17 Ranelagh-grove Pimlico and am the conductor of an omnibus The prisoners lodged in the same house for some months—they were lodging there in Feb last—I see my handwriting on this 5l note No 64252—I received it from my wife who is in a very delicate state of health—I got it changed and put my name on it at the time NICHOLAS PEARCE I am an inspector of the A division of police I took the prisoners into custody on Thursday the 4th of April—I found them living at Kingston in Surrey—Thornton and Kend all were with me—I went alone into the room where they were—I was not in uniform—I found the two prisoners in the room—I beckoned Francis out of the room and asked who that female was—he said She is my wife —I told him I was a policeofficer and that I should take him into custody for being concerned with that female in committing a forgery on Smith Payne and Smith on the 9th of Jan —he said I can explain that —I said Be cautious what explanation you give —he said I hope it is not known in the house —he said Don t let it be known—she is not my wife —I then left him in custody of one of the officers and went into the room where the female was—I told her that I should take her into custody for presenting a forged check to Smith Payne and Smith purporting to have been drawn by Lady Nelthorpe—she said I am innocent what did Mr Francis tell you —I made no answer—that was all she said Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Do you know a lady named Baker a milliner in Piccadilly A I never saw her—I have never been to her—I believe one of the officers has been either Kendall or Thornton but I do not know—I saw a female at Bow-street of the name of Boyd I believe—when I apprehended the prisoners I seized all their papers and documents both their writing desks their letters bills and every thing they contained—there were bills showing with whom they had dealings—I have sent to several of those parties—I have not gone myself—I have not sent the forged check to those parties—I did not send it to Miss Baker or direct it to be taken—I have heard it mentioned that it has been taken MR BODKIN Q Among the other papers did you find the bill that has been produced A Yes—I believe it to be the same—I found it in Brown s writing desk at Kingston EDWARD KENDALL police-sergeant A 30 I accompanied Pearce to Kingston—Francis was left in my custody and while Pearce went into the room he asked me what I knew of the affair—I said Very little —he said I knew Smith Payne and Smith were Miss Brown s bankers—I know she went with a check on the 9th 10th or 12th—I do not know who paid it—I was not present but money was placed in my hands—I dare say some of the notes will be traced to me and so I can trace them —he said the affair quite staggered him Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q I believe it was a respectable house they were lodging at A Very at Messrs Muggeridge the corndealers STEPHEN THORNTON police-constable K 26 I accompanied Pearce to Kingston—after the prisoners were taken into custody I conveyed Francis to the station—on our way there he said he had been told by the female prisoner that it was an annuity of 200l and he did not know to the contrary—next morning I conveyed him from the place where he was confined to the railway station—he then repeated that he understood from her it was an annuity of 200l —he said that he went with the female prisoner to Smith Payne and Smith s the bankers and she went in whilst he remained outside and that when she came out she brought him the whole of the money she had received for the check and most likely the whole of the notes might be traced to him or the greater portion—he asked me if the body of the check was filled up in his handwriting—I told him I did not know anything about it—he said nothing more Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q I believe he several times expressed himself with indignation at being taken up on such a crime A Yes he did—before we had this conversation I desired him to be careful what he said—he said he knew nothing of the affair he was charged with he always understood from the female prisoner that it was an annuity—I do not remember his saying that he did not fear the strictest inquiry or that if he had suspected anything wrong he would have been the first to go to the banker s and investigate it—when the female prisoner was taken into custody she was dressed in a genteel lady-like manner and looked very much like a lady MR EVISON re-examined No customer named Miss Brown had any account with us that I can recollect NICHOLAS PEARCE re-examined I was at the police-office—Mr Francis was admitted to bail—it was proposed to call him as a witness but his counsel objected—I do not recollect Mr Jardine the Magistrate saying he could scarcely ask him any question unless there was a free pardon The check was dated January 9th 1844 for 190/ payable to bearer and signed M Nelthorpe BROWN—

with intent to defraud John George Weston JOHN GEORGE WESTON I am a tobacconist and live at No 35 Holbornhill On the 25th of April about seven o clock the two prisoners came to my shop together—Withers spoke first and asked me the price of goods which I told him—he then said that he wanted to make a purchase and that he had a bill which he produced—I said if it was a good bill I had no objection to take it—he said it was accepted by a party in the Custom-house if I inquired I should find it worth my notice—he left it with me to see if I would take it—this is the bill—it is accepted by a Mr Burnside—his residence is stated in the bill as Spring-terrace Horsemonger-lane—I went next day to the Custom-house—I did not find any such person as Burnside—I did not see the prisoners myself afterwards till they were in custody Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q I believe you entered into an arrangement with Withers to take some cigars on your discounting the bill A No—he left it with me to inquire—I said if I found it was good I would take it—I did not inquire at No 5 Spring-terrace as Burnside was not known at the Custom-house—the prisoner represented him as a clerk or officer there—I inquired of several people in the hall—I found he was not in the Custom-house at all and did not trouble to go to Spring-terrace—I have been there since and found a Mr Burnside lived there and next day we went and he was gone and his goods also—I did not know Burnside and never took two bottles of wine with him—when I went after Withers was in custody I was asked to take a glass of wine by a person representing herself as Mrs Burnside—I did not see Mr Burnside there at all—the address of Withers No 15 Stand-gate-street Lambeth is on the bill—I went there to arrest him—he was not there—nobody knew the name of Withers there—after a deal of inquiry and waiting about all day we found him and found he had lately married a person named Bath—he was living there by that name JAMES MORRISON I am in the service of Mr Weston The prisoners came to the shop when master was not there—I had not seen them when master was there—they came together about ten o clock on the Saturday evening—Withers said they had made an agreement with Mr Weston for some cigars and they had come to take them away—they named what sort they wanted and I gave them 2lbs of cheroots 2lbs of different sorts and 2lbs of British Havannahs—they took them away and Withers gave me a 5l bank-note—Withers came back and said he would take another pound of cigars—the goods amounted to 3l 1s —I gave him 5s which was all the change I had and they went away—I put the 5l note into the till until I went home—I then gave it to Mr Weston—there was no other note there—it was the only note I ever took Cross-examined Q I believe Withers called three times that day A Yes—the first time was about one o clock—he asked me if Mr Weston was at home—I said No I thought he was at the other shop in Queen-street—they went out then called again between four and five and asked if Mr Weston was in—I said I had not seen him since—I did not tell them he was at the shooting gallery—they called the third time about ten and asked if Mr Weston was within—I said No —Withers said he had come for the cigars he had made an agreement with Mr Weston and I let him have them—he said he had been into the country and was going again and would come for the change of the note when he came back on Monday—he told me to tell master he was the Mr Withers who had left a bill with him the day before—I told master so—master had told me not to give up the bill and I did not—I looked at the number of the note when it was first given to me to see the number—I am certain of that—this is my signature to this deposition— the deposition stated The note was No 1769 I took no note of the number at the time I put it into the till I noticed the number at the time MR WESTON The witness gave me the 5l note—I looked at it and pronounced it bad immediately—I went on Monday morning to the Bank and had it marked forged —this is it JOSHUA FREEMAN I am inspector of Bank-notes at the Bank of England This note is forged in paper plate and signature Cross-examined Q Do you call it a good imitation A No THOMAS GREATHEAD I am a cheese monger and live in Bridge-row Lambeth I received this 5l note which has been produced on Saturday the 13th of April from a woman—on looking at it afterwards I imagined it to be forged and sent after her—she brought the prisoner Withers to me the same day and said in his presence he was the person who had paid it to her—he asked to look at it—I showed it to him—he said it certainly was the note he had given her but from the parties he had it from he did not think it was a bad one—I told him my impression it was that I had spoken to the woman and I should have the money back on Monday—I had given her the change for it—on the Tuesday they paid four sovereigns—I kept the note till Saturday the 27th about eleven o clock or from that to one when Atkins brought the remaining sovereign and took the note away—he was not with Withers when he came before but he had called in the meantime with a message and he said he had come from Withers to pay the sovereign and take the note Cross-examined Q Did you know who the woman was A Yes I had known her some years—I think Withers said he knew it was the note he paid the woman because the name of Mason was on it—he looked at it and said it was the note—I cannot say he recognised it by the name on it but I had seen that name on it—it had been kept separate from other notes—I told the woman I believed it was a bad note—she proposed to take it back and pay me SARAH MURRAY I live in Temple-street St George s-road

t18440610-1549  1549 DANIEL WRIGHT was indicted for feloniously forging and uttering a warrant and order for the payment of 390l with intent to defraud Sir Samuel Scott and others MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution GEORGE TAYLOR I am a clerk in the banking-house of Sir Samuel Scott Bart and two others—they carry on the business in Cavendish-square under the firm of Sir Claude Scott and Co On the 3rd of May the prisoner presented this check for 390l to me and said he wished change for it for Mr Redmayne of Bond-street—Mr Redmayne was a customer of ours—I gave him six 50l and four 20l notes and ten sovereigns—the check was forwarded from our house to the Bank and was afterwards returned to us as forged Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q I presume that you have before cashed checks on the cashiers of the Bank of England A Yes—I cannot say that I know an instance where the cashiers of the Bank of England have cashed a check of this description—it was their rule to refuse to cash checks not written upon printed forms but with their alterations lately I cannot say whether it is so now—the indorsement induced me to cash the check—I know Mr Ceates—I believed this to be his writing at the time it was presented to me ARTHUR MAITLAND I am a clerk in the Bank of England This check was produced at the Bank and returned as being forged—I examined the signature of Pulsford—it is not his writing—we have only one William Pulsford who keeps cash at the Bank—we never pay checks except on printed forms Cross-examined Q Then whether forged or not you would never have cashed this check A Certainly not WILLIAM PULSFORD I live at No 11 Hyde-park-terrace I keep cash at the Bank of England—this check for 390l is not my handwriting—I never authorised any one to put my name to a check of that sort—I knew nothing of Mr Redmayne previous to this transaction MR CLARKSON Q It is not at all like your writing A Not at all GILES REDMAYNE I am a silk-mercer and live at 20 New Bond-st I did not send this check to be cashed on my account or for my accommodation by the prisoner—I never saw it till it was produced by the policeman—I have a clerk named Ceates—I never authorised this indorsement to be made—it is not Ceates s handwriting nor at all like it in my opinion—I only know the prisoner as the brother of a lad who is an apprentice of mine and lives with me—I have seen him once or twice at his father s and spoken to him FREDERICK CEATES I am a clerk in Mr Redmayne s service The indorsement For Giles Redmayne T Ceates on this check is not my hand-writing—I did not send the prisoner with it to get it cashed for Mr Redmayne JONATHAN WHICHER police-sergeant A 27 In consequence of information I received I went in pursuit of the prisoner—I traced him to Birmingham and on the 24th of May I apprehended him at the Victoria hotel Euston-square—a female was in company with him—they were in one of the parlours at breakfast between ten and eleven o clock—I asked the prisoner his name—he said Day —I told him I was an officer and I was going to ask him some questions which he would do as he pleased about answering—I asked him if he recollected buying a gold watch at Whistler s in the Strand—he said he did—I asked if he knew where he got the 50l note from with which he paid for it—he made no reply—I told him he must consider himself in my custody on suspicion of uttering a forged check at Scott s in Cavendish-square for 390l —he made no reply at that time but afterwards he said it was a bad job and he must put up with the consequence—he asked me several times if I thought he should be transported—I searched him and found on him five sovereigns and 4s 6d and in a writing-case in the room 70l in gold and a quantity of jewellery a gold watch and pin and articles of wearing apparel most of them new—this is a list of them which I made at the time—part of the things were given up to the female when she was discharged—I found in the prisoner spocket-book a check similar to the one produced—it is signed Pulsford the same as the other—I brought him and the woman away in a cab—he said It is a good job you took me to-day for I think I should have uttered that other check to-morrow yet I don t think I should have had the heart to have done it —he said he was in difficulties at the time he did it and it was through the women—I asked him at the time I found the gold if he had any more money—he said no he had lost two of the 50l notes Check read — 11 Hyde-park-terrace 3rd May 1844 To the Cashiers of the Bank of England Please to pay Mr Giles Redmayne or bearer the sum of 390l which place to my account Your obedient servant WILLIAM PULSFORD GUILTY Aged 21 — Transported for Twelve Years Fourth Jury before Mr Recorder

his intent to be to defraud Edward Western and others —Two other COUNTS with intent to defraud Edward Western and another MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution ROBERT EAGLESFIELD GRIFFIN I am a clerk and cashier in the firm of George Carr Glynn and others there are six partners On the 25th of July this check for 65l signed E Western was presented by some one I do not know who at the counter of the banking-house—I paid it in twenty-five sovereigns and four 10l notes Nos 56319 to 56322 inclusive dated the 4th of June 1844 Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Were you the person who received this check A Yes and I paid the money—I took down the numbers at the time—it took two or three minutes EDWARD WESTERN I am a solicitor and live in Great James-street Bedford-row I keep a cash account at the house of Glynn and Co and am in the habit of drawing checks on that house—the prisoner was in my employment from six to nine months—he was first employed as a permanent clerk—he ceased to act in that capacity I should think about two years ago—I have employed him occasionally and given him writing to do out of the office since that time till the present—I do not doubt that he had an opportunity of knowing that I kept an account at Glynn s—my check-book was usually on the table in my office—this is the book—there are three checks printed on every page—on the first discovery of this forgery I examined the book and missed the last sheet from it—I have two numbers on my checks my own private number and the printed number which is on them when Glynns issue them which is B X 901 to 1200—my number is put on them when I fill them up—it would not be on the blank checks—the check produced is not my handwriting or any part of it nor was it written by my authority—the signature I should say was a good imitation of mine—I am acquainted with the prisoner s handwriting and have seen him write frequently—I believe the filling up of this check to be his writing—the signature is not like his writing it is an imitation of mine—the name and address on this bank-note James Martineau 9 William-street Islington I believe to be the prisoner s writing Cross-examined Q I believe the prisoner is a relation of yours A No—the family do not consider him a relation—his father was my uncle—he is an illegitimate child—I have frequently seen writing of his in the office briefs that he has copied—I cannot recollect when my attention was last called to it—his is a very stiff handwriting and he writes very slow—I call his whole writing peculiar from A to Z—his f is always peculiar ending square at the bottom and every letter—this James Martineau is not much feigned—it is not much like his ordinary writing—it is more like his writing than that in the check—I have a stronger belief about it—he lived at one time with his mother but I do not think he did latterly COURT Q Was your own private number for your information or the banker s A Merely for my own—it is a number in the margin which I put when I fill up the checks and of which the bankers take no notice because I might possibly issue a check without putting that number which I should do if I did it away from the office JOHN RICHARD SYKES I am a clerk in the Bank of England On the 25th of July I cashed these four 10l notes numbers 56319 to 56322 dated the 4th of June 1844—I gave forty sovereigns for them—I do not know the person who presented them—I do not remember asking the person to write his name—I might have done so if he had not done it before—I should not have cashed them without the name and address—we always require it—this is James Martineau Cross-examined Q You gave the money A Yes—I have never seen the prisoner before to-day—I was not examined at the police-office MR BODKIN Q Did you also enter the name in a book A Yes—the entry there is Martineau four 10l notes —the name is only on one of the notes CHARLES FRANCIS WESTERN I am brother to the first witness and am a solicitor in Great James-street I know the prisoner—I have been in the habit of seeing his writing and seeing him write at my office—this check was not written by me or by my authority or knowledge—I believe the filling up in the body of it is in the prisoner s handwriting—I believe this name and address on the back of this bank note to be in his handwriting Cross-examined Q Have you a stronger belief of the one than the other A That on the back of the note is more like his ordinary writing than the other—I think it is quite as stiff as the other—stiffness is the character of his handwriting—I think this on the note is more like his ordinary writing than the other—I have had frequent opportunities of seeing his writing—I first saw this check on the Wednesday or Thursday following the date of it—that was before the prisoner was taken into custody—I was with my brother in the room when he got the pass book from the bankers—I saw this note on the following day—the prisoner was given into custody on Saturday morning—I did not show this to any of the clerks till after the prisoner was taken—it was shown by Mr Bush EDGAR THEODORE HEPBURN I am clerk in the service of Messrs Western I have known the prisoner about three years—I am very well acquainted with his handwriting—I believe this check to be his handwriting and the writing on the back of this note I believe to be his Cross-examined Q Do you mean to swear that you have any belief on the subject of this check A Yes—I believe it to be his handwriting—this is the first time I have seen it—I have seen one of the notes before—his is a very peculiar hand—I should know it ever so much disguised—I think I could trace it if quite altered—it is quite altered there—it is a very strong writing—I never saw a hand like it—this check is more disguised than the other—it is not so strong not so much in the character of his handwriting—I do not think it so stiff as the other—it is not so much like his general writing it appears to be freer—this on the note I think is more like his general writing WILLIAM MEE I am clerk in the service of Messrs Western and have been so nearly eighteen years I am acquainted with the prisoner s handwriting—I believe this filling up of the check to be the prisoner s writing disguised—the body of it bears a very strong resemblance to his—I am more inclined to think it is his than any one else s—I believe the body of it to be his—the handwriting on the back of this bank note I think is also his—I was at the office on the 24th of July last—the prisoner came there in the course of that day—he was at that time occasionally employed—he passed through Mr Charles Western s room into mine—Mr Charles Western was not there—he waited in my room a few minutes and then went into Mr Charles s room again on his way out—whilst he was there I heard a sound like a sheet of paper being torn in two—there are two doors which open from my room into Mr Charles s—when he went out he partly closed the door he could not quite shut it—I could not see him after he had partly closed it—I heard the sound almost immediately he went into the room—I did not go into the room just then I did in about five or six minutes—he was not there then—I think the bankers check book was lying on Mr Charles s table at that time I cannot say for certainty I think it was—it is occasionally there and occasionally in Mr Edward s room—I do not recollect that I had seen it in the course of the day—I had no occasion to look for it—I do not know that I did see it except at the time I went in—I think I did then I cannot say for certain Cross-examined Q When did you first recollect that you heard anything like the tearing of paper A Some days after—I cannot specify the exact time when Mr Edward first found out that this forgery was committed—it was before I was examined before the Lord Mayor—I am quite sure of that—I cannot state the time I first recollected it—Mr Western told me I must recall to memory what occurred as far as I could—I do not recollect that he suggested that it could hardly have been done without my knowing it—I told him about the tearing of the paper immediately I recollected it—he was the first person I told of it—I cannot state the day I told him—it was before I was examined before the Lord Mayor—I will swear it was before the examination—I am quite certain about it—I did not mention it to him on the first occasion because I did not recollect it—I was examined by the Lord Mayor and I went before the Grand Jury—I believe the body of this to be the prisoner s writing and this on the note likewise—I should say they are both his writing—I have not more belief about the one than the other MR BODKIN Q Do you remember being examined at the office of Messrs Bush and Mullens solicitors for the prosecution A I do—that was before I went before the Lord Mayor—I mentioned about the tearing the paper to the clerk of the solicitors but not at his office in St Mildred s-court WILLIAM KENTISH I am an engraver in Change-alley Cornhill I engrave the check books for the house of Glynn and Co —this check book of Mr Western is one that I engraved—at the end of this book a sheet has been torn out—this is one of the checks that I engraved forming part of this book JOHN FORRESTER I am an officer of the City I took the prisoner into custody on this charge on the 3rd of Aug in London-street Caledonian-road where he said he lived—on searching his boxes I found fifty sovereigns in a little box and on his person 5l 10s in gold and 2l 1s in silver—57l altogether and fifteen pawnbrokers duplicates three of which are of recent date the others are in 1843—they are for small amounts—in consequence of directions I received I have made inquiries about a person of the name of Martineau of No 9 William-street Islington—there is no such number in the street and no such person WILLIAM COCKING I live at No 25 London-street Caledonian-road Islington The prisoner lodged with me about three months up to the 25th or 26th of July last—he was to pay me 4s a-week—the first month he paid me pretty fair but after that it was dropped and went on for several weeks—he owed me 1l 12s for rent before he left—that was up to the very day he left 26th of July—on that day he paid me 1l 10s —he paid me with two sovereigns—I did not see whether he had any more money about him—he came down and said Cocking I shall pay you —I said Very good —he said Will 30s do for you —I said I don t know my rent is 1l 12s I will name it to Mrs Cocking I dare say we shall not be particular for 2s —I went into the shop—my wife came in—I said I would not mind 2s so he handed me over two sovereigns—I said I have not got change I will go and get it —he said Never mind for the present any time will do in the course of the day —I thought it would be handy for him and I got change and gave him the 10s —he appeared as usual—not at all excited—a cab fetched his boxes away that evening—he left with it—he rode outside—I do not know where he went—next day or the day following he came to ask if there were any letters for him—I did not see any change in his dress then—I did not let him in—I never saw him after that day Thomas Hewit Key lecturer at University College William Wells attorney s clerk Tokenhouse-yard Ellen Clark wife of a bookseller Sarah Morgan wife of a cabinet-maker and Mary Dodd wife of John Dodd of No 56 Marchant-street gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY strongly recommended to mercy Aged 20 — Transported for Seven Years Before Mr Baron Gurney

t18440819-2181  2181 PIETRO VALLER FRANCISCO ENRICO and HENRY HARRISON were indicted for feloniously making and engraving certain parts of a foreign undertaking for the payment of money issued by a body corporate recognised by his Majesty the King of the Netherlands —Other COUNTS varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution LOUIS GLUCK ROSENTHAL I am an artist and live in Wellington-terrace Waterloo-road—I occupy some rooms on the second floor of the house On Thursday the 18th of July the prisoner Harrison called on me—my landlady came up to me and then Harrison came up—he said he had heard the report of the work of the Duke of Sussex—I had published a portrait of the late Duke of Sussex—after half an hour s conversation about the Duke of Sussex he said I can give you a job to do of my own —he said the name of Hatton had introduced me to him—I did not know such a person—I said I should be very glad to do the job if it was in my line—he went down stairs and said he would bring me an answer in two minutes time—my curiosity led me to the window to see where he went and it was into the Waterloo-road which is just before my door—I saw the other two prisoners communicate with him—he came up stairs in a minute s time presented to me this paper marked A and asked if I could do 350 the same as this genuine one—I said I should think I could do it—he asked how much I wanted to have for 350—I said 3l 10s —he said I have nothing to do I must go down stairs and ask the others —he went down for two minutes came back again and said You can make instead of 350 500 for the same price —I agreed to that—he asked me what time he could have the first impression—I said he could have one on Friday but being my Sabbath I asked him to call on Saturday—I asked him where he resided—he said Never mind where I live —I told him he must leave me a few shillings deposit—he said Well perhaps I will but I must go down stairs again —he returned brought me half-a-sovereign and said I want change I will leave you 5s —I gave him 5s out of the half-sovereign—I told him he could have the impression on Saturday—he said I will call to-morrow evening or Saturday for the first impression and he said You have no reason for the deposit because this genuine one which I leave with you is of the value of 2l —he told me the 500 must be printed twelve on one sheet and to avoid the watermark as much as possible—he enjoined me that I should not tell anybody about this job to keep it a secret—at that time I did not know the value of the instrument but I had some suspicions—I showed it to a friend—I went to the City to make inquiry and then went to the police-court Union-hall and on the following day in consequence of what I heard there I went to the office of the Consul-General of the Netherlands—I saw Mr Owen an engraver on Friday and engaged him to do the work—on Saturday evening at a quarter to seven o clock he brought me a copper-plate and while he was with me I saw from my window Enrico and Harrison walking together opposite my house—I pointed them out to Owen and directed him to go down stairs—about seven o clock Harrison came to the house—that was the time appointed—he asked me if the first impression was done—I showed him the copper-plate—he asked why it was not done—I told him I could not get the same paper as the original—he said Never mind this time about the paper next time I will get paper from Amsterdam —he looked at the plate said nothing about it but took it down stairs as he said to show to the other parties—he said I shall not bring it up stairs I will hand it to you at the shop door —he brought it back to me and said Correct —I only saw Enrico with him that day—I told him if he called on Monday evening at the same time he should have the first impression—Owen brought me some printed papers on Monday evening—these are the proofs he brought me—Harrison called at seven o clock on Monday—I showed them to him—he seemed contented with them—he went down stairs to show them to the other party—I did not see anybody outside at that time—I pointed out to him some defects in the engraving and said the whole must either be cut in wood or stereotyped to resemble the original—he did not make any observation but was very agitated that the first impression was not done—I was to go on getting it done in wood—he said he would call on Wednesday evening—there is an ornament on the original document scrollwork—he said all those spaces must be kept open so that there should be no kind of join there—it seems not to join in the original—I told him the first impression would be done on Wednesday—he came on Wednesday evening about the same time—the engraving on wood was not quite ready but the first impression the proof from the wood was done—he told me I ought to have asked the parties five guineas instead of 3l 10s —I said Well I have only seen you I have nothing to do with the parties —he said Never mind you might ask the party when he calls to-morrow evening —he said he would send his card with the party to-morrow evening that I might see the party and he said You should charge him five guineas instead of 3l 10s —he said You must know they have given me 10s as a deposit and I have only given you 5s and therefore when he calls on you to-morrow you might ask him five guineas because I want to have a sovereign out of it for my trouble —I said Very well send me the party —he said he would call himself the following day and I should pay him the 15s out of the 5l I was to ask the foreigner—he told me not to part with the original until they had paid me when they came for it—on the Thursday evening I received some more proofs from Owen—these marked F and G are them—on the same Thursday evening Valler came and produced an envelope containing this card with the name of Harrison on it but no address—I asked him if he knew German—he said No I know a little French and asked me if the 500 were ready—I said I could not get them ready because they were not dry—I said I had received a proof and I showed him the proof which Owen had brought that evening—he said That will do it is very correct —I said it was a difficult job as Harrison had told me to say and asked him a sovereign more—I could not in my conscience ask him 5l —he said Well you shall have 4l and gave me a sovereign on account—he took the proof away with him—on the Friday evening Harrison and Valler both came to my room rather before seven—I told them the copies were not quite ready—part had been printed but not the whole—I promised him faithfully to have them ready by Saturday evening at that time—Valler was very vexed and discontented that they were not done—I promised them faithfully for the next day at six o clock—on Saturday about five o clock I received a quantity of copies made up into five parcels in brown paper from the sergeant of the police—I also received the original coupon and a block or two—I opened the parcel containing the blocks—these are them—I tied the parcel up again and about seven o clock Harrison and Valler came—they asked if the job was done—I delivered to Valler the five parcels I had received from the police with the original coupon on the top of the others—he opened the parcel and showed it to Harrison—they looked at the impressions—Harrison made no further observation Valler saying that for the future I should have plenty of work to do quite in another style he seemed perfectly satisfied—Harrison said nothing but seemed as well pleased—Valler then paid me 2l 10s the remainder of the money—when I handed the paper containing the blocks to Valler I said he should take that away with him—he said I shall leave it with you —I said No you had better take it with you and he took them away with the 500 impressions—these are them—Valler left the room first and after he had left Harrison sat down in a chair and said Now settle with me as well let me have for my own trouble the money —I gave him 5s and told him he had better call to-morrow for the 5s but he said Never mind pay me now and I paid him—I was acting in concert with the police and the Consul all through Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q I suppose you had never seen Valler before A No he was quite a stranger to me—I do not know how the blocks and things came into the hands of the police—I knew it to be wrong—I went on with it by the direction of the police—I made the extra charge for Harrison s sake—it was not my hand that engraved the plate it was Owen s—I have had jobs in engraving but in any honest line—I am an artist but take any job for a few shillings Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You say on one occasion Harrison was agitated that the first impression was not done was not what he said You give me a great deal of trouble in calling so often and I shall not get at all more paid for it A I did not hear that—he said I only wish you would tell me a certain time that I am to call either morning or evening and I shall have less trouble WILLIAM OWEN I am an engraver and live in Albemarle-street Clerkenwell I got these blocks made for Rosenthal by people employed by me—he called on me—I went to his house on the Saturday and took the copper-plate with me—while I was there he pointed my attention—I looked out of window and saw Harrison and Enrico on the opposite side walking past—they were together—after looking at them by Rosenthal s direction I left the room and Went down stairs—I saw Harrison come into the house about ten minutes after I went down and a minute or two after I saw Harrison in the place—I was in the back parlour—he went up stairs while I was down—Harrison had a small paper parcel at the time he came into the house again—he passed it to Rosenthal and said it would do very well—that was in the shop—it was the copper-plate which I had brought—I heard him say They must be done without fail on the Monday by seven o clock in the evening —I took the copper-plate back with me and the other part was to be done in wood—I saw no more of them that day—I went to Rosenthal s again on Monday at a quarter before seven and took these proofs with me which are from the letterpress part—while I was there that evening I noticed Enrico and Harrison outside and as they passed they met Valler who joined them—they remained there in my sight about half an hour—I proceeded to engrave the wood blocks and took proof from them to Rosenthal s on the Thursday—I did not on that occasion see anybody near the house—I gave the proofs to Rosenthal—these are them—I was aware all this time that Rosenthal was in communication with the police and I went to them myself before I commenced BETSEY PAVEY This house in Wellington-terrace where Rosenthal lives is my husband s I remember on Thursday the 18th of July Harrison calling and at the same time I observed Enrico and Valler outside—Harrison came again on the Saturday and on the Monday following—and on the Monday I saw Enrico and Valler outside while Harrison was there—on the Wednesday following I remember Harrison coming alone and next day Valler came himself—the next day Valler and Harrison came together—while they were with Rosenthal I saw Enrico outside who joined a fourth person—Valler called again on the Saturday with Harrison and I saw Enrico outside then—they came three times that Saturday evening and—I saw Enrico outside on those occasions STEPHEN THORNTON police-sergeant I am one of the detective force I was employed on this business by the solicitors to the consul-general of the Netherlands On the Friday I was near the York Hotel Waterloo-road about half-past five o clock and saw the prisoner Enrico sitting on a cask inside the house—I was there myself—I did not observe what he was doing—about half-past seven I observed him in company with the other two prisoners and another—they were in conversation together at the corner of York-road in Waterloo-road about fifty yards from Rosenthal s house—I followed them down York-road to the Obelisk—that is going from Rosenthal s—they remained in conversation a short time at the Obelisk and then separated—as they went down towards the Obelisk I observed Harrison frequently turning round and looking behind—I was not in my uniform—when they got to the Obelisk Enrico and Harrison went down the London-road and Valler and the one not in custody down Blackfriars-road—I followed Valler and the one not in custody over Blackfriars-bridge up Holborn down Leather-lane into a court in Eyre-street Leather-lane—I did not notice them speak to anybody in the course of their walk—I followed Valler till one o clock to the Italian school in Greville-st where he remained about an hour—he came out of there with another party—I followed them to Lincoln s Inn-fields and further on I saw Valler meet the witness Fielitz in Holborn and have some conversation with him—I left Valler at last at Eyre-court Eyre-street-hill—next day Saturday I was in the neighbourhood of Waterloo-road and at half-past six saw the three prisoners—Valler and Harrison went to Rosenthal s door and rang the bell and two I believe it to be Harrison and Valler went in—Enrico remained outside—I did not set them come out but I saw them after they had come out and saw them all three together—Valler was carrying a small parcel wrapped in this handkerchief-ther joined Enrico almost immediately they came out of Rosenthal s—I followed them to the Hero of Waterloo in Waterloo-road—I went into the house—the three prisoners were sitting in a box by themselves in the parlour—Valler was sitting outside the box—the papers all laid between Enrico and Valler—I said to Valler You are my prisoner and in the act of my reaching for the parcel Valler put his hand out to catch the parcel—I caught it in his hand—they were all three taken into custody and taken to the station—I searched Valler and found on him a pocket-book and the blocks and a paper in his left-hand coat pocket—the parcel was fire separate parcels of the impressions—I found this proof F among other things in his pocket-book and also this the genuine coupon marked A —I also found these papers on him— K L M and N —I did not search Enrico DAVID GALLICO I am an Italian and am an interpreter living in Litchfield-street Soho I know Valler and Enrico—I knew Valler by the name of Giacome San Michele and Enrico by the name of Francois Mutta—on Monday the 22nd of July I saw Enrico by the Duke of York column at the bottom of Waterloo-place between five and a quarter after—Fielitz a German was with me—we had some conversation together and I left Fielitz and joined Enrico—we afterwards entered a public-house and had a glass of cider and after a bit he said to me I am obliged to leave you as I have an appointment on the other side the Waterloo-road at seven o clock exactly —I walked with him as far as the Strand near Waterloo-bridge and then left him—Valler saw me six or seven weeks ago as I was on Saffron-hill—he called me aside privately and said he wished to speak to me he had got a job for me—I asked him what it was—he said to do some writing some language for him—he appointed to call at my house—I gave him my direction—I said if I could not do it most likely my wife could as she writes well—I told him so—he did not come—I met him afterwards and he afterwards came in about a week—I wrote my address for him and he called and said he was very sorry the writing would not do— looking at the paper marked L —this is my address in my handwriting which I gave him—I afterwards got my wife to write and handed it to Valler—this is it M —he said that most likely would do—he called about a week afterwards at my place early in the morning and said he was very sorry I could not suit the writing but he should be glad if I could recommend him anybody to write and I introduced Fielitz to him on Friday the 26th of last month at a public-house in Bear-street Leicester-square—we had some gin to drink—Valler on that occasion produced this passport and desired Fielitz to imitate the signature of C Salati on that—Fielitz tried to imitate it—Valler said he was quite satisfied and what he would give him to do the signature he wanted him to do would not be so long as Salati—he then produced this F and said that was the work and he wished him to put a full name similar to that and he should have fifty for him—he appointed next Saturday to call at the house at eight in the morning to come to my residence—he never came ADOLPHE FIELITZ I am a Prussian and an interpreter by profession I live in Cecil-court Leicester-square I know Gallico—he introduced me to Valler who told me he had something to write—he showed me a passport and spoke to me about imitating that signature—he asked me if I could write the same as that—I said yes I could—I wrote just the same and he was satisfied and said That will do —some time afterwards he took out his pocket-book and showed me some coupons—this is one—he said he wanted the name of the clerk of the banking-house to be written on it he should want forty-five or fifty done and said there would be 100 or 200 to do—I met him in Holborn at eleven o clock on Friday evening—I did not know him—he came up to me and shook hands—next day I went to the office of the Consul of the Netherlands and gave information EDWARD KENDALL police-sergeant I accompanied Thornton on Friday the 26th to the York-hotel Waterloo-road and saw Enrico sitting on the end of a cask looking out of window—he could command a view of the road—Thornton and I separated—I went a short distance down the road and saw Enrico come out and stand at the door—he remained there about a quarter of an hour and was joined by Harrison—Harrison went to Rosenthal s—I at last joined in taking them—I searched Enrico and Harrison—on Enrico I found a pocket-book containing two or three cards with an inscription on them—he gave his address No 4 Trafalgar-place Gibraltar-row Lambeth—I went to that house and went all over it—there are two rooms down stairs and one up—I found nothing but two or three letters RUDOLF ADRIAN MEES I reside at Rotterdam—I am one of the firm of the Administration-office of Jan Van der Hoop and Gerardus Eck We issue certificates of Dutch stock

t18441125-20  20 THOMAS SMITH was indicted for feloniously forging an acceptance to a bill of exchange for the payment of 29l 18s with intent to defraud Michael Levy Green and another MR CURWOOD conducted the Prosecution EPHRAIM LEVY GREEN I am in partnership with Michael Levy Green—we are wholesale clothiers at No 10 Houndsditch About the middle of August last two men who gave their names as J and J Trueman Acton Middlesex called on me and wanted clothing—they referred me to a Mr Golding in Cullum-street—I was not satisfied with the reference—I communicated with them and said the reference did not suit and it being the first transaction I should like it to be a cash transaction—the second time they called they said they would give me a better reference which was Henry Dawer No 22 Ashford-street—I called on Dewer who was the prisoner at the bar—I asked a person there for Henry Dewer and was told he was not in—a female said he was only in the neighbourhood and she fetched the prisoner—I asked him if I had the pleasure of addressing Mr Dewer—he said Yes —I asked what he knew of the Truemans—he said he had known them for twenty-five years and would have no objection to become security for them in any way I pleased—I asked if he had any objection to sign an acceptance to a bill—he said Not in the least —on the 9th of Sept in consequence of this I furnished the Truemans with goods and they brought the prisoner down to sign the bill of exchange on the 10th of Sept —my brother wrote out a bill of exchange and the prisoner signed it in my counting-house in my presence—the prisoner was the acceptor—he accepted it in the name of Henry Dawer—it was at two months after date—this is the bill— read addressed to Henry Dawer Ashford-house Ashford-street Hoxton —when the bill was given one of the Truemans wanted to hurry the prisoner away but he said No just allow me to take the particulars of the bill in my oldfashioned way because when it becomes due I must pay it —when it became due I presented it at the house it was addressed to but the house was closed—I found no one there—I never met the prisoner again till now—I have not seen the Truemans since—they have absconded—I found the prisoner in custody for swindling and charged him with accepting the bill—his real name is Thomas Smith Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q I believe the bill was not given till the goods were delivered A One day after—the goods had been delivered to Trueman in the absence of the prisoner—I had seen the prisoner at Ashford-house Hoxton when I first went—it was in consequence of what he said that I let Trueman have the goods—I took the bill on his responsibility having three names on the bill altogether WILLIAM HANDLEY I live at Stoke Newington-green Middlesex I am landlord of the house No 22 Ashford-street—I let it in July last to a person who gave me the name of Henry Dawer Redcross-square—I agreed to accept him as a tenant—the prisoner is not that man—I let it to the man from the 13th of July last HENRY WILLIAM DUBOIS I am sergeant of the police On the 2nd of Oct I went to No 2 Harvey-street Hoxton and found this memorandum of agreement—the prisoner was apprehended there by Kemp—I went to search the house afterwards WILLIAM HANDLEY re-examined This is the counterpart of the memorandum I executed to the supposed Mr Dawer GEORGE KEMP police-constable A 22 I went to No 2 Harvey-street Hoxton on the 2nd of Oct —the prisoner rang the bell—I went up and opened the door—he asked for Mrs Dawer—I told him she was down in the kitchen and asked him to walk in—after he had come in I closed the door and kept him there—I told him Mrs Dawer was at the station-house and if he wanted her he must go there—he asked if anything was the matter if there were thieves or robbers in the house—I said No —he said Let me go I am a respectable gentleman and tradesman here is my card giving me one—I cannot swear this is the one but it was the same as this—I have two or three of them but they are all the same—this is the one to the best of my knowledge— read— R Apsell tin-plate worker brazier and ironmonger near the Post-office Upper Mitcham Q When he came there he asked you for Mrs Dawer A Yes and gave me the card as his real name and address—I went there and saw the landlord—I saw a woman said to be the prisoner s wife—I took her to the station—I am quite sure he asked for Mrs Dawer and gave me that card as his real name and address SAMUEL JONAS I am in the employ of Green and Co I presented the bill at the house on the 1st of Nov but found no one there GUILTY Aged 49 — Transported for Fifteen Years 
t18441216-212  212 WILLIAM BURGESS was indicted for feloniously uttering a forged transfer of a certain share and interest viz 6 305l 3s 5d in the 3 per Cent Annuities standing in the name of William Oxenford with in­ tent to defraud the Governor and Company of the Bank of England 2nd COUNT stating his intent to be to defraud William Oxenford 3rd Count with intent to defraud George Shum Storey and others THE HON J STUART WORTLEY with MESSRS ADOLPHUS and CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM SMEE Esq I am the chief accountant at the Bank of England I produce a copy of the account of William Oxenford taken from the Bank ledger which is a public authentic book kept at the Bank of England—I have examined it with the ledger and it is a true copy Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Is it your handwriting A It is not—I believe it is the writing of a clerk named Beaton—I compared it with the book I think the day before yesterday—I did it alone looking first at the paper and then at the book—Beaton was not assisting me in the comparison—I so carefully examined it that I can swear that it is accurate in every respect This account being referred to stated that William Oxenford was possessed of the sum of 9 800l Three per Cents and that 6 305l 3s 5d of the same had been transferred to G S Storey and others and 1 894l 16s 7d to H Mortimer COURT Q This means that Mr Oxenford was entitled to those sums of stock A On the credit side you will find he is credited for 10 000l and on the debit side in the early part of April last he was debited 200l leaving a balance of 9 800l —the two subsequent sums are the sums in question—this is from the ledger of the Consols MR ADOLPHUS Q Was the prisoner employed in the bank in September last A He was—his duty was such as to give him access to all the ledgers in the Transfer-office and were he to go to any particular ledger no question would be asked him conceiving it was his duty to do so—he was employed in the Power of Attorney office—he would know the whole course of business and could furnish himself with whatever particulars he wanted Q Did he at any time apply to you for leave of absence A He did—I am not certain whether it was on Saturday the 31st of Aug or Monday the 2nd of Sept —the probability is that it was on Monday the 2nd of Sept —he asked leave from the 3rd of Sept to the 5th which he had given him—he did not return at the end of his leave Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q How long you have been in the employment of the bank A Forty-three years—the Three per Cent Consol office is a separate room to the Power of Attorney office in which the prisoner s business was performed—it is not in a separate part of the building it is contiguous—it may he said to be a separate office though intimately connected with the Transfer-office—he had a duty to perform in the Consol-officein going to put limitations on Power of Attorney and for various other inquiries that he clerks in the office may call on him for MR ADOLPHUS Q Do you mean that these offices are separate buildings or only separate rooms A Merely separate rooms—there is a door separating the Transfer-office from the Power of Attorney office just as you go from a front to a back parlour—you merely walk from one room into the other—he hade access to the Consol books in every way whatever COURT Q His duty was with reference to powers of attorney generally for every species of stock I suppose A Yes—in order to enable him to perform his duty with reference to the preparations of proper power of attorney he would have access to the books showing the different state of accounts as well as the Consols—he would go into the Consol-office take up the ledger and open it and no question would be asked the clerks considering it part and parcel of his duty—if he was instructed to prepare a power of attorney for 1000l for A B part of a sum of 2000l he would have authority to examine the books in order to see if A B was entitled to such a sum WILLIAM OXENFORD I live in John-street Bedford-row—I was formerly in the Custom-house for many years In September last I had a sum of 9 800l in the Consols—I never transferred or consented to the transfer of any part of that money—I never signed any paper or power what ever to any person to do so—I never saw the prisoner in my life till I saw him at the Mansion-house—I never knew a person named Joseph Elder—this signature of William Oxenford in this transfer-book looking at it is not my writing—I can see with out my spectales that it is a forgery—I never empowered anybody to write that for me Cross-examined Q Had you accepted this stock A I do not know—I may have done such a thing—I left it to my broker who is a most respectable man—I have always been in the habit of receiving my dividends personally—the Bank books would have a great many signatures in my handwriting MR ADOLPHUS Q There are two transfer-books signed William Oxenford are there not A Yes—neither of them are my writing COURT to MR SMEE Q Is it a very common thing for persons to have stock transferred to them without accepting it A Exceedingly common—I should think nine persons out of ten do not accept RICHARD BORD I am a clerk in the Consol-office in the Bank on the 3rd of Sept I received from Mr Sutton a clerk in the same office two tickets— looking at them —these are them—I received them from him for the purpose of effecting a transfer—they are usually deposited in a box and we take them out as we are going on entering—these came into my possession from Mr Sutton—he was somewhere about the Transferoffice passing over tickets—I saw the prisoner in the Transfer-office at that time—I am uncertain whether I received the tickets from the hand of Mr Sutton or whether I may have taken them from the box but they came direct from him—I received them in the Transfer-office—I am employed in the Transfer-office—the prisoner was not in the office at that time—he made his appearance a few minutes afterwards—I happened to have the number of tickets in my hand when he came up—there were several other clerks assisting there and he came up and inquired who entered stock for the name of Oxenford—I replied that I did—I had these tickets then in my hand—he then asked me if I would oblige him by entering them directly as Mr Oxenford was waiting—I therefore proceeded to enter them in the Transfer-book—whilst he was waiting I asked him if he knew Mr Oxenford having known the name many years ago before I was in the Bank—he replied that he did—he was an old friend of his—I said He must be getting an old man now —he said he was—when I had completed it I said Where is Mr Oxenford —he said he was outside minding the horse—that he meaning himself had got an early off that day and they were going down to Gravesend together—I supposed by that that he had done his business for the day and had leave to go away early—he then went out to fetch Mr Oxenford and shortly returned with a gentleman and asked me for the book—he then asked What gentleman will see it —it is the custom that one clerk should witness the transfer and that another person in attendance with the party transferring should witness his identity—it must be some person known to the Bank—the prisoner took the book and took it to Mr Ingall another clerk who was close by sitting in the same office—at the same time I heard him say to the person who had come into the office Come along Willey or some such expression as that it is all ready —I saw him and the other person come up together—I did not myself witness the act of the transfer of this stock—I did not see the signature—I after wards accompanied John Forrester the officer to the United States—we left London on the 18th of Sept —we ultimately went to Boston and found Elder in Federal-street No 51 we had been to a variety of other places first —it was on a Thursday about the end of Oct —he was passing by the name of Ellis—I recognised him as the man who had come into the Bank with the prisoner after his going out to fetch Oxenford who he said was minding the horse—I told Forrester that he was the man—Forrester took him by the coat and said Your name is Joseph Elder and you are lately from London —he was afterwards committed to prison and I heard afterwards that he had destroyed himself—I went with Forrester to Nahant where the prisoner escaped from but did not go up to Brewster s Island Cross-examined Q You were not examined before the Magistrate at all I believe A No JAMES SUTTON I am a clerk in the Consol-office I compared these two transfer tickets with the account of William Oxenford and afterwards delivered them to Mr Bord to enter in the transfer in the Bank books—that means filling up the printed forms for the purpose of transferring the Stock according to the tickets taken from the box Cross-examined Q You were not examined before the Magistrate A No THOMAS INGALL I am a clerk in the Consol-office I was in the Consol Transfer-office on Tuesday the 3rd of Sept and remember seeing the prisoner there—when I first saw him he was a few feet from me on the public side of the counter—there was a person with him—I knew the prisoner well but not the other person—the prisoner called my attention by saying Perhaps Mr Ingall you will see this * meaning that I would perhaps witness the transfers —he bad the transfer receipts in his hand—the book was on the counter—I took the receipts from him—I have no recollection of answering him—the person he had brought with him then signed these transfers William Oxenford —my place at the counter was about six or seven feet from where Mr Bord stood Q How was the book transferred from Mr Bord to you A So far as I recollect the prisoner merely brought the book a little nearer to me but did not come immediately opposite to me—he brought the book from Mr Bord and I think he brought it forward and placed it in the position in which it was signed by Elder—the prisoner in the meantime or immedi­ ately after read to me the amount transferred from this book and the names into which the amount was going and I checked him on the stock receipt or tickets which I had in my hand at the time—these are the tickets that I had in my hand at the time—my signatures are to them—the amount transferred is reading 6305l 3s 5d to George Shum Storey John Petty Musprat William Cotton and Matthew Whiting —I found that cor­ responded with one of the receipts I had in my hand—nothing had passed between me and the prisoner before this as to who the person was that he brought—after the person had signed the transfer the prisoner wrote in William Oxenford and his own name at the back as the witness to the identity of William Oxenford the person making the transfer—this is it— Witness to the identity of W Oxenford W Burgess Bank —the words Witness to the identity are in print the name W Oxenford was written in ink by the prisoner and then he signed his own-name describ­ ing himself as of the Bank—when he had signed his name the book was turned round by the prisoner to me to examine the transfer to see that it had the signature of William Oxenford that he was properly identified and that the witness to the identity was named there—I signed it as the attesting witness—I then handed the prisoner the receipts of which this is one and he walked away—I had previously signed my name to it—I do not recollect whether the receipt was signed before it was placed in my hand nor do I recollect seeing Elder sign it—it was signed as it now ap­ pears when it was in my hand with the exception of my own signature—I put my signature to it at the time the prisoner read the amount from the transfer-book and I checked it on the receipt—that receipt was handed by me to the prisoner—it had been signed by Elder in the name of Oxenford before it was put into my hand—I do not recollect seeing it signed by Elder—Elder went out with the prisoner Cross-examined Q I understand you to say that you do not remember seeing this receipt signed by anybody A I do not—I have witnessed the signature of the party—it is constantly the case that receipts are brought and not signed in our presence—it is frequently the practice for brokers to come with persons who are about to transfer with the receipts already signed at their office—they acknowledge it as their receipts of course—this was passed over to me and I assumed it to be right and put my name to it as the witness—I was not noticing this transaction from the time the application was made to Mr Bord—Mr Bord was about six or seven feet from me—he was not the very next person attending to business there was one between us at the counter at the time Mr Tomkins—these books lie on the counter in the office and are pushed along from one to the other as they are required—the book would be presented towards the public side of the counter for the transfer to be executed—I have a very considerable number of these transactions in the course of a day at times—I do not generally keep hold of a corner of the book while the party is signing and then draw it back to its right position opposite myself—I have very rarely held the book while a party is signing it—as soon as it is signed I quite as often draw it back as the party pushes it back—I certainly do not watch the party to see more than is necessary for the transaction of the particular business—the book is either draws back by ourselves or returned by the broker Q At this distance of time I suppose you cannot say in which way this particular transaction was done A As far as my recollection serves me Burgess turned the book round—I think I can be positive of it—to the best of my recollection he did so—I will swear positively that he did so—there was nothing remarkable in this transaction to call my attention to it—I cannot tell how many transfers took place in our office that day because I am not engaged in the whole of them—I cannot tell how many I was engaged in—I should imagine there must have been a good many after this on that day because it was a heavy day with us—it is impos­ sible to say whether the transfers appear in the book in the order in which they were-made in the office except with regard to these two—I do not find one just before or after it in which I have been the attesting witness—whatever 1 attend to I put my name to—I do not see any other in this book that day which I put my name to—I see no other in this book except these two transfers of William Oxenford—there appears to have been six other transfers that day—it does not appear by these entries that I witnessed any except those of Oxenford—there are other books in which I probably witnessed on that day—without looking at the books I cannot say whether I did or not but the probability is that I did—I do not positively remember—to the best of my belief I should say I did Q Can you remember in any one instance that occurred that day whether the party coming pushed the book to you or you drew it back with the single exception of this transaction A I cannot nor on the day before nor the day after Q Will you explain then what there was peculiar about this transac­ tion to enable you to swear with any degree of positiveness as to how the book was treated on the occasion of this particular transfer A The thing came to light in a few days after and I endeavoured as well as I possibly could to bring to my mind all the circumstances that had taken place—I was examined before the Magistrate Q Is this the first time you have stated that fact of the prisoner s pushing the book A I do not recollect whether I was asked the ques­ tion before—I cannot positively recollect whether this is the first time I have stated that the book was handed or pushed to me by the prisoner—I think it is HON STUART WORTHLEY Q Is the attesting witness to the identity generally the broker A Yes I have frequently seen a clerk of the Bank an identifying witness—I knew the prisoner s person but had no acquaintance with him beyond knowing him in the establishment—I think my attention was called to this transaction on the Monday after the 3rd of Sept—the facts were fresh in my recollection at that time THOMAS TOKELEY I am a stock-jobber and have been so for nearly forty years I know the prisoner by his entering my tickets in the Three and a Half Reduced—I know nothing more of him than as a Bank clerk—he called on me when I was standing in the Bank at the latter part of Aug and said that he had a friend who wanted to raise 8000l and he had 8200l stock—I do not think a word passed beyond that—I had no further conversation with him at that time—he left me immediately—on Tuesday the 3rd of Sept I saw him in the street at the foot of the Bank steps—he brought me a ticket filled up in the regular way for the purpose of the sale of 8200l stock—it was a ticket of this sort the ordinary transfer ticket that is used at the Bank—I did not notice what name it was in—I noticed the amount in figures—I immediately passed it to Clement Smith who is a stock-jobber and we agreed as to the purchase at I think at 98 7-8ths the price of the day—I calculated the amount that would be in money—it was 8107l 15s —I afterwards received from Mr Smith in the course of the day two receipts—this is one of them—it was not then signed—I gave them to the prisoner to go into the Consol-office to make the transfer—I believe at the time I gave him the receipts I was standing at the bottom of the Bank steps in Bartholomew-lane—there was a crowd of persons about there—I do not know that any party was in his company—he took the receipts from me—when he came back from the Transfer-office he brought me the same two receipts—I was then standing on the Bank steps—they were then regularly signed and witnessed by the clerk—I believe at that time he had a friend with him but I never spoke to him—I saw a person with him—nothing passed—the prisoner gave me the receipts and I passed them to Henry Smith the son of Clement Smith to go and fetch me the money—the prisoner told me he would wait at the Auction-mart Coffee­ house for the money—I afterwards received this check looking at it for 8 000l from Clement Smith also a 100l note a 5l note and 2l 15s in cash—I took them to the Auction-mart Coffee-room—I there found the prisoner sitting down with the same man that was with him when he brought me the receipts—I put the money on the table before them—his friend took up the 8 000l check and the prisoner took the cash and the Bank notes—he never told me who the other person was—I had no conversation with him whatever Cross-examined Q As far as anything appeared to you it seemed a regular transaction A I had no reason to doubt it at the time—there was nothing unusual in it or in the mode of conducting it—I had no reason to suppose there was anything unusual at the time CLEMENT SMITH I am a stock-broker and jobber Mr Tokeley applied to me on the 3rd of Sept to purchase of him 8200l stock Three per Cent Consols—I was to give 8107l 15s of it—the transfer ticket was made and the thing done all regularly—the name of William Oxenford was on the ticket as the party making the transfer and he was described as of the custom-house—I had not the money at that moment and applied to Mr Mortimer—I had one ticket given to me in the first instance by Mr Tokeley for 8200l —Mr Mortimer afterwards gave me one sum of 6305l 3s 5d and the balance was to go in his own name and my clerk by my instructions wrote these tickets—I made it into two sums one of 6305l 3s 5d to George Shum Storey John Petty Muspratt William Cotton and Matthew Whiting all of the Pelican-office Lombard-Street and the balance 1894l 16s 7d in Mr Mortimer s Own name—I do not Know what became of the original transfer ticket for the 8200l —we had no occasion to keep it and it must have been destroyed—I cannot say that I did destroy it—I have looked for it—it has given me a deal of trouble—it is not a document that I am in the habit of keeping—I know the prisoner—I went to the power of Attorney-office to inquire if he was there on Tuesday morning the 3rd of sept after Mr Tokeley had spoken to me about the business—I should think it was about a quarter to elevan o clock—I heard he was not there and was not likely to be there—this is the check by which the purchase of the stock was made—gave it to Mr Tokeley and afterwards gave him a 100l note a 5l note and 2l 15s in cash the balance of the money Charles Chatham Lawrence I am one of the cashiers at the banking-house of Sir John Lubbock and Co On Tuesday the 3rd of Sept last about twenty minutes before two o clock this check for 8000l was brought to me by two persons the prisoner was one the other was a person of about forty-five or fifty years of age—the prisoner had a carpetbag on which he was leaning on the counter—it appeared to me to be empty—we always ask the name of parties presenting checks—I did so on this occasion and the name of Oxenford was given—it was the prisoner s companion who presented the check to me and who gave that name—I asked how he would like it and he replied Part or all in gold —I said If you want part or all in gold you had better have large notes and get the whole of it at the Bank of England —I eventually gave them eight notes of 1000l each—I put them into the hands of the person who accompanied the prisoner in his presence—these eight cancelled notes are the notes I paid on that occasion— these were Nos 22201 to No 22208 all dated 13th May 1844 —the prisoner s companion counted over the notes in his presence and before he left the counter I saw him write something in the corner of the notes in the prisoner s presence—I did not see what he wrote—to the best of my recollection it was his companion who counted the notes and wrote in the corner of them— looking at a carpet-bag produced —the bag on which I saw the prisoner leaning was such a one as this that was the prevailing colour and pattern of the bag—I do not speak to its identity but it was that sort of colour and pattern—the prisoner s companion was a man I should judge about my own height about 5ft 9in but being on the other side of the counter I could not exactly judge of his height he had a ruddy complexion and was a well-looking man—I did not observe particularly whether he was stout or thin WILLIAM HIGMAN I am one of the superintendents of the issue department of the Bank On the 3rd of Sept last about two o clock in the afternoon a man presented eight 1000l notes at my counter for cash—it is necessary according to the practice of the Bank to have the name and address of the party presenting notes for payment—when these notes were handed to me there was some writing in the comer which I could not decipher and I asked the party presenting them his name—he said Oxenford —I observed that there was only Brixton put as the address—in consequence of that I put a question to him gave him the pen and requested him to write—he wrote Vassal-road on them—after being inspected by the inspectors they were handed to Mr Ager one of the tellers—I gave him the order for the gold and Mr Ager got it—I saw Dean the porter bring 10 000l into the office in bags of 1000l each—I did not see the bags given to the party as my duty took me to another part of the office—I afterwards saw the man emptying the gold from our 1000l bags into two canvas bags which he put into a large carpet-bag that he had in his hand—it was such a bag as the one produced about that sixe and description—I cannot say that I saw him attempt to lift it—I after wards saw Aston and Dean two Bank porters each with a bag on his shoulders go out of the hall—they were the two canvas bags that the man had brought with him—I did not see him put the two canvas bags into the carpet-bag—I saw him with the two canvas bags—I have heard Mr Lawrence s description of the party who presented the notes to me—it is quite correct—he was a stout ruddy man about forty-five yean of age—I can speak to the first of these notes looking at it being one that I cashed on that occasion—I saw him put Vassal-road on it THOMAS AGER I am teller in the Issue Department of the Bank On the 3rd of Sept between one and two o clock I received directions from Higman to get some gold—it was near two o clock—I accordingly got 10 000l in gold—I assisted Dean the porter—it was in separate bags of 1 000l each—I brought them from the Treasury and desired Dean to give the person I believe to be Elder eight of the bags—I saw eight bags put on the counter and saw a person there who I believe had presented the notes—that person took them away—he had a carpet-bag and two canvas bags—the canvas bags were on the counter—the carpet-bag answered the description of the one produced—he put them into the canvas-bags and then into the carpet-bag but both the canvas bags were taken out and carried away by two porters—I delivered the gold in the Issue Department which is in the hall—there is a passage through the hall—on crossing the hall you get to the out-teller s office—between the hall and the out-teller s office there is a passage which is darker than the rest of the Bank—the drawing produced looking at it is a correct plan of that part—I should think that a person standing where this blue mark is could see me place the gold on the counter—this pink mark is where 1 was standing—a person standing at the blue spot could see me pay the money and if he was familiar with the Bank he could leave the building without passing through the hall MATTHEW GIBBINS I am a bookseller and stationer and deal in patent blacking On the 3rd of Sept I had occasion to go to see a gentleman at the Bank on business—I had passed through the hall—when I got to the out-teller s office it wanted four minutes to two o clock—I observed that by the clock as I had made an appointment to be there at two—I passed through the passage which runs outside the out-teller s office and saw a person there who was always represented to me as Mr Burgess—I believe it to be the prisoner—he was standing looking towards the hall—I have seen this plan—he was standing at this blue spot or perhaps within afoot or two of it—he was on the right hand side of the passage—I have been to this place since and looked towards the hall and found a person might see what passed at the part marked pink which is the second desk—the hall is very light but this passage is darker—I said to him How do you do Sir and believe I said Burgess but he did not answer—I left him there Cross-examined Q You were not examined before the Magistrate A No WILLIAM BEST EDE I am a clerk in the Sorting Department it the Bank On the 3rd of Sept 1 received from the witness eight 1000l banknotes and signed my name for they—they were Nos 22201 to 22208 inclusive LEONARD DEAN I am porter at the Bank and remember this occurrence on the 3rd of Sept when 10 000 sovereigns were brought into the teller s office—I laid eight bags of 1000 each on the counter myself for the gentleman to receive—he emptied those eight bags into two larger bags which he brought with him and put those two larger bags into a carpet-bag—I was afterwards called in with Aston and assisted him in carrying the bags to the outside the Bank—there was a dark green open carriage like a phaeton outside the Bank drawn by one horse—I put the bag into the bottom of the carriage—I had a very slight knowledge of the prisoner—there was a driver on the box of the carriage—I did not notice him sufficiently to say whether it was the prisoner—the carpet-bag was like the one produced JOHN RAY I am a clerk in the Power of Attorney-office and know the prisoner On Tuesday the 3rd of Sept I saw him in the middle of the day—I cannot tell the hour but I met him in a phaeton near Birchin-lane—it was a one-horse carriage and the prisoner was driving—it was a dark-green coloured carriage—he was turning out of Cornhill into Birchin-lane—there was a person in the carriage older than the prisoner about forty-five years of age of a ruddy complexion and stout—I did not know Elder—they went down Birchin-lane away from the Bank towards the river SOPHIA COHEN I am married and live with my father Mr Soloman in Vinegar-yard—he keeps a general dealer s shop On Monday the 2nd of Sept I remember the prisoner coming to our shop—I was present—my brother who is since dead served him—he asked for a portmanteau—there was one at the time standing at the door—he asked to see it down and when it was shown to him he asked to have it blackened over—my brother undertook to have it done—he asked if he could have three bags made to fit the bottom of it—they were to be made very strong indeed and of brown holland—he said they were to be sent to Mr Caunt s public-house at the corner of St Martin s-lane the Coach and Horses—my brother asked for a deposit—I did not hear what the prisoner said in reply—it was after that he said it was to be sent to Caunt s and Caunt would pay for it—the portmanteau was blackened—I think it was about three o clock and it was sent home between four and five the same evening— looking at a portmanteau —I believe this to be the same—it has got white edges inside as the outside was blackened—it had been white—this is the same portmanteau THOMAS PASTILL I am a boot and shoemaker and live in George-street Portman-square I knew a person named Joseph Elder for three or four years—I did not know his business—I believe he was a dealer in horses—I know the prisoner—I first became acquainted with him about the same time as Elder—they went to the same house as I was in the habit of using—I first met the prisoner at Mr Warren s the George Townsend public-house Oxford-street—Elder I believe lodged there—I knew but little of the prisoner till September 1843 when I met him at Margate—he was then in company with Elder—I had seen him previously at the George Townsend in company with Elder—about three or four months after I came from Margate Elder and the prisoner called at my house one evening—Elder asked if I knew any one who could accommodate the pri­ soner with board and lodging or if I could myself—I said I did not know any one and had not room myself but if I had a vacancy I would let him know—in July last I had a vacancy and left a letter at hit lodgings—he afterwards came to lodge at my house in July—I had seen him and Elder together at other places after they applied about the lodg­ ing—after the prisoner came to lodge at my house Elder called to see him several times—I remember Sunday the 1st of Sept —I saw Elder there about a quarter to one o clock in the day—the prisoner and Elder were sitting just within my shop door—as soon as I opened my parlour door and went into the parlour from the passage they rose up and said Let us go up stairs —the shop door was open and they were sitting in the shop—it is a back shop door leadsing into the parlour—Burgess s lodging was up stairs—they remained up stairs about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I rung the bell for Burgess to come down to dinner—he knew what the bell meant—they both came down together—Elder was going away—I asked him to stop dinner which he did—after dinner I laid down on the sofa and while lying there I heard the prisoner mention the word power of attorney —Elder said How is it to be done —Burgess replied It is like placing two boxes on this table take it out of one you put it into the other —there was then some conversation which I did not hear—the next I heard was Elder say Is it to be Tuesday or Wednesday —Burgess replied I do not know I will tell you to-morrow —Elder then said to Burgess What clothes do you mean to travel in for I have got no great coat —Burgess replied No more have I —Elder said I shall wear my loose one I had seen him wear a loose coat —Burgess replied I shall wear this over my black one —he had a loose coat on at the time a kind of wrapper which he used to wear—I went out at about half-past three o clock in the afternoon and left Elder there—while I knew him he went by the name of Joseph Elder—the prisoner knew him by that name—I returned to my house about ten o clock at night and found the prisoner there but did not see Elder—on the Monday Elder was at my house three times—he called a fourth time but I did not see him then—he called first about twelve in the day for a bird that Burgess had but did not take it then—Burgess was not there—he came a second time for the bird und took it away—he came a third time in about ten minutes—he had left his umbrella and returned for it—I saw him and Burgess together that day at the George Townsend in Oxford-street about ten o clock at night—I did not hear anything pass between them—Burgess was sitting by my side—Elder came to the door and beckoned him out—he went out they returned in about twenty minutes together and remained together about an hour—Burgess left with me and went home—I did not see Elder the next day—while the prisoner lived with me I had some money to put in the funds and got him to bring me home the price of stock—he once told me he had 2000l in the Bank—he borrowed 2l of me about a week after he came to lodge with me and on the 2nd of Sept he borrowed a sovereign—he went out in the morning of the 3rd of Sept —he was gone out when I came down stairs—I saw him again a little before nine o clock—I had been out and found him in the parlour at breakfast—he went out about half-past nine or ten o clock and came in again about half-past three o clock in the afternoon—he then had a coat on similar to the one he has now and a blue handkerchief round his neck—he walked to my house—I saw no carriage whatever but when he went out in the morning he had a drivingwhip in his hand—when he came in the afternoon he paid me 7l in gold which he owed me—they appeared new sovereigns—he left between half-past three and half-past four o clock I believe—I never saw him again till he was at the Mansion-house—when he left my house he said he should be back that night he should not be late—he had three sovereigns in his hand—he showed them to me and said This is all I have got 1 shall not be late Q He said once that he had 2000l A Yes that was when I asked him the price of stock—I think it was in Aug —he said he was going to sell out some money—that was on Sunday the 1st of Sept when I came home—he said he had no money and should get some next week that his friend George was going to sell out and he would let him have some—I should say Elder was about fifty years of age about five feet six inches rather stout with rather grey hair and whiskers Cross-examined Q You were not examined before the Magistrate A No—I first heard of this forgery on Monday the 9th of Sept —I communicated this to Forrester that afternoon—I was before the Lord Mayor but not examined JAMES WILKINSON I am a stable-keeper at Portman-mews Portman street Portman-square—I let out carriages On Monday the 2nd of Sept between seven and eight o clock in the evening I think the prisoner applied to me for a horse and phaeton or a cart or anything I could let him have as he wanted to do a little business in the City—I had seen him about there before—he mentioned a fishmonger in George-street who came with him as knowing him—I had not known him long—he had a gig of me some time before that—he went away in the morning by himself in the phaetorn—I saw Elder at the corner of the street at the time—I had known Elder some time—he had recommended me to Elder for a character when he hired the gig —Elder was between forty and fifty rather nearer forty—Burgess started in the phaeton by himself but when he got to the top of the mews Elder walked towards him in Portman-street—he walked across the square to him—I did not see him get into the phaeton—he apparently got into it but I could not see so well as I was round the corner but Burgess turned round towards where Elder was and pulled up as if for him to get in—he said he was going to do a little business in the City and bring something in the phaeton—he wanted something with plenty of room in it something strong—that he should be some hours absent—the phaeton came back but I was not present JOHN WARREN I keep the General Townsend in Oxford-street it it also called the George Townsend—Joseph Elder lodged at my house for three years till Sept last—the prisoner was in the habit of visiting him—towards the last two or three months previous to Sept his visits be­ came rather more frequent—he sometimes came to Elder before he was up in the morning and went into his bed-room—I remember Elder coming in on the 3rd of Sept about three o clock in the afternoon and taking leave of me—he shook hands with me said he was obliged to me for all favors that he was going out of town and he might be gone a fortnight or six weeks—about two hours after that I was in the passage of my house and saw Elder there—it was about five o clock—he was in front of the bar—that was the last time I saw him WILLIAM DRAKE I have been a groom employed at the stables in Portman-mews On Tuesday the 3rd of Sept between two and three o clock I was at the corner of Portman-street and Oxford-street—I saw a one-horse open phaeton coming up Oxford-street from the City and come to the corner of Portman-street—the prisoner was driving it—he asked if I could go along with him—he said he wanted some one to bring his horse and chaise back to Mr Wilkinson s—I went with him to George-street and several places—he brought a parcel out of George-street put it into the bottom of the carriage then drove back to Portman-mews to Leonard s the Three-tuns Portman-mews he then went to Shackell s-in Bryanston-street then went into a public-house and came out with a soldier—he went into different houses leaving me to take care of the horse—there was a large pareel in the phaeton wrapped up in a coat and a earpet-bag full and two parcels which he brought from Shackell s it was two bundles of clean linen—I went with him to Caunt s in St Martin s-lane—he had the soldier on the box with him then—when he got to Caunt s he took the things out of the phaeton himself left me there paid me and sent me back to Mr Wilkinson s with the phaeton—I took it there GEORGE ARLIS I am a coachman and live in Park-street Grosvenor-square—I know the prisoner and knew Joseph Elder In the first few days of Sept last they came to my mews—I cannot tell the day—I only know it was the beginning of Sept by this letter which I afterwards received the post-mark of which is the 4th of Sept —it was two or three days before I received the letter—it must have been the 1st 2nd or 3rd of Sept —I have every reason to believe it was the 3rd—they came to me in a four-wheeled phaeton with one horse—Elder came into my stable and spoke to me—I went out and the prisoner was standing on the curb-stone with the reins in his hand—I took a saddle and bridle out of the phaeton and I believe they went away together—Elder owed me 10s and left the saddle and bridle with me for sale—I was to return his wife the difference of the money—this was as near ten o clock as I can recollect— looking at a letter —I believe this to be Elder s writing—I never saw him write BENJAMIN CAUNT I keep the Coach and Horses St Martin s-lane I know the prisoner by his coming to my house previous to this robbery—I did not know Elder—the prisoner was at my house four or five times during a fortnight before that—he came in a grey coat which he gave my brother when he went away—he was dressed as a horse-dealer in boots coming up to the knees and spurs—I should think it was about a week before the 3rd of Sept —he showed me his spurs and said he was a horse-keeper and his stables were in Oxford-street that he had five large hay-ricks down in the country and also a large farm that if he knew I kept a horse he could have kept it for me and would not have charged me anything for it for a considerable time—I said I am much obliged to you my mare stands in Regent-street —he said I think I shall sell my farm and five hay-ricks make what I can of them and go and buy a farm in America —he said Can you let me have a private room here for a week or so I will pay you well for it —I said I will if possible —he said I shall have 8 000l or 9 000l with me and shall have six soldiers with me to guard me and that he was going to deposit the money in the bank at Newcastle-on-Tyne—he came in a day or two after with a portmanteau and said Caunt will you lend me half a sovereign to deposit on this portmanteau till I fetch it and he had three bags—he came to me inside my bar which does not look into the street—he asked me to lend him 10s or pay 10s for the portmanteau and keep it as security—I said I don t know you the man can leave the portmanteau and I will be answerable for the money and if you don t want the portmanteau the man must fetch it back —the man was there with it on his back—he left it—I ordered it to be taken into my bed-room and not delivered up till the money was paid—this is the portmanteau—he said When I come I shall have the money and will pay you before I take it away I shall have 8 000l or 9 000l and then 1 will pay you —I was not at home on the 3rd of Sept ROBERT CAUNT I am the last witness s brother and am his waiter and barman On Tuesday afternoon the 3rd of Sept the prisoner came to the house in a four-wheeled phaeton drawn by one horse—a soldier came with him and Elder came a few minutes after—they had a carpet-bag with them—the prisoner and the soldier carried the carpet-bag between them—it was very heavy indeed—they carried it with difficulty—the prisoner asked me for a private room—I said There is the bar-parlour you can walk into which they did-the prisoner ordered refreshment and while I was getting it ready in the bar I heard a noise in the bar-parlour—it waslike jingling of gold—I looked through the curtain which divided the bar from the parlour and saw gold in the carpet-bag which was open—there were two canvas bags in it—the prisoner was handling the gold—one bag had burst and some gold got loose into the carpet-bag—I believe the prisoner put some of the gold into his pocket—I saw him do so—I asked the pri­ soner where he was going with that gold—he said he was going to the Edinburgh bank and said I have two soldiers to guard me —I asked him to let me lift the bag for a reason of my own—I tried but could not on account of its weight—while Elder was there the prisoner asked me where my brother or his mistress were—I said they were both out—he asked me if there was not a portmanteau of his here—I said I believed there was but he could not have it as it was locked up in their bed-room—Elder said If money will get it we must have it —I called the pot­ boy to the bar and Elder sent him for a locksmith—the servant went up stairs with him—he picked the lock and brought the portmanteau down—I gave the prisoner the bill for it and he paid me 1l 10s for it—he said that was all right—Burgess put both the canvas bags with their con­ tents into the carpet-bag—about seven o clock Elder went for a cab and brought it to the door—the prisoner was still sitting in the bar-parlour—Elder came to the bar and pressed on him to go or he would go without him he could not wait any longer his time was expired—I got down everything that was owing and they paid my bill 2l or 3l —they had had port and sherry and beef-steaks—the prisoner paid it—the portman-eao was locked up—the prisoner and the soldier carried it out of the barparlour to the cab—Elder was before the bar—he and the prisoner got into the cab which went off and 1 saw no more of them—I did not hear them direct where to drive Cross-examined Q Were you examined before the Magistrate A No nor was my brother—I first told this story last week—I believe I heard of the robbery a fortnight after it took place—I was in the country at the time—the officer came to my brother s house and I told him of it JAMES GINGLE I am a soldier in the Foot Guards I know the prisoner by being in company with him seven or eight times but did not know his name On the morning of the 3rd of Sept between eleven and twelve o clock I saw him driving a phaeton with one horse opposite the sigger s Head Tower-hill—I was quartered at the Tower—he cut me with his whip and asked me for Randle another soldier—I said he was in the Tower he would find him in the barracks—he asked where I was going—I said 1 had leave till twelve o clock and was going to the Three Tons near Portman-barracks to meet a friend—he said there was going to be a supper at Caunt s and asked me to meet him there—I said I should not be able—he had somebody in the carriage with him who appeared between forty and fifty a very stout man—between three and four that afternoon the prisoner came with the carriage to the Three Tuns where I was and asked me to come into the carriage and go to Caunt s—I did so—Drake was in the carriage when I came out—when I got to Caunt s I helped him to carry the carpet-bag out of the carriage it was very heavy and was like the bag produced—I cannot swear to it—I helped him to put it into the little room next the bar—it was getting rather dark it was near five o clock—I remained at Caunt s till he went away about a quarter or twenty minutes past seven—during that time I saw two canvas bags inside the carpet-bag—he took them out of the bag when a person came to inquire for him just before he went away—I saw him put them on a chair—I did not see what he did with them afterwards as I left the room—there were three of us together—he said he would trouble us to walk into the other room—there was a civilian with me—I do not know who—it was after we had had beef-steaks and wine that he desired us to go into the other room—before he went away another person came—I think it was the same person I had seen in the morning—I had never seen him before that morning—he came into Caunt s and asked the prisoner if he was ready to go—I carried the portmanteau into the cab and the prisoner carried the carpet-bag—the portmanteau was rather heavy—I saw the prisoner carry the carpet-bag—it did not appear so heavy as when I had carried it—the prisoner and the other man went to the cab—one got inside and the other out—I do not know who the other man was Cross-examined Q Were you examined before the Magistrate A No JOHN HUGHES I am a paper-stainer I was at Caunt s public-house on the night of the 3rd of Sept and saw the prisoner there—I was one of the party—we had four bottles of wine and some beef-steaks—I saw the soldier there—I knew Elder before I had seen him scores of times—he came there about twenty minutes after seven o clock—he said to Burgess I want you to go directly —he said I am coming in five minutes Elder said If you don t come I shall go I have a cab ready at the door —the prisoner went away with him in a cab—one Grinham was there that night Cross-examined Q You were not before the Magistrate A No GEORGE BENBOROUGH I am a porter at the Mersey-hotel at Liverpool At half-past five o clock on the morning of the 4th of Sept two persons arrived at the Hotel by the London-railway in a rail way-carriage—the prisoner is one of them—the other was a stout ruddy-complexioned gentleman from forty-five to fifty years old I should think—one of them I do not recollect which asked me if they could have a private room to take breakfast in also a place to put their luggage—I noticed none of their luggage except a heavy portmanteau of a dark colour which I took on my shoulder—it was extremely heavy—I showed them to a private room—I afterwards heard the prisoner ask Mr Home the landlord if he would give him notes for sovereigns—he could not do it but desired me to show the prisoner to a bullion-dealer—I offered to go with him but he declined going—he went out by himself—that was about nine o clock—I did not see what became of his companion—I saw the prisoner again between ten and eleven—his companion was then with him—the prisoner asked me to take his luggage into the boat to go on board the Britannia steam ship—took his things down—I do not recollect anything particular but the port­ manteau—I noticed that owing to the weight of it—I do not remember whether I took anything else or not—I put them on board a small boat to take them to the Britannia—I saw the boat go out towards the vessel JOHN HEWITT I am commander of the Britannia steamer—she was advertised to sail from Liverpool to America on the 4th of Sept —we sailed about half-past two o clock that day—we had nearly one hundred passengers on board—I was not aware that the prisoner was a passenger for three or four days—I saw an elderly gentleman a stout man with a ruddy complexion in his company—he appeared about forty-four or fortyfive years of age—they both went by the name of Ellis on board and passed as uncle and nephew—the prisoner called the other man his uncle—I landed them at Boston on the 16th of Sept —the prisoner is the man who came in my ship in the name of Ellis JOHN FORRESTER I am chief officer of the City of London stationed at the Mansion-house I received a warrant for the apprehension of two persons named Burgess and Elder and in consequence of instructions ac­ companied by Mr Bord from the Bank I proceeded to America—I arrived at Halifax and traced the parties from one place to another till I arrived at Boston where I found a person answering to the name of Elder—he was going by the name of Ellis there—on the 31st of Oct I got into the house where he was lodging and awaited his arrival and on his coming home about one o clock in the day 1 apprehended him—I told him I had a warrant against him and showed it him—I said Your name is Joseph Elder —he said It is —Mr Bord saw him and recognised him as soon as he came in—after placing him in a place of security I searched his lodging and found 400 sovereigns in this black portmanteau and some clothes in a cupboard which I did not take away then—the portmanteau I brought away directly—I found in it some cards with the name of Ellis on them and a plate with it—these are some of the cards and he had some of them on his person—I found letters in the portmanteau addressed to him in the name of Elder and this discharge under the Insolvent Act—I brought some linen here which is marked J E —I took him before a justice and proceeded with Mr Bord and officers from Boston in search of the prisoner to Nahant which is a small peninsula I think about fourteen miles from Boston—there is an hotel there—I went to the hotel—the American officer who was with me showed himself at the hotel—I did not see the prisoner there—I stopped there all that night Thursday the 31st and part of the next day—I was about different parts of the island on Friday and on Friday night I returned to Boston—before that I saw this carpet-bag at the hotel at Nahant and left it there—on Saturday I went to a place called Brewsters s Island which is up the river about eleven miles from Boston—I had an American officer with me—I went to a kind of wooden hut or cottage there and found the prisoner there—he knew me before and I was acquainted with his person—the officer went in first—I followed and the prisoner was by the fire—at that time he was without whiskers—when I knew him at the Bank I think he used to wear a little whisker but I am not positive—I went up to him and he said to me How are you John —I said I am very well but am very sorry to see you in such a situation —he said So am I but it can t be helped now old fellow —we came away together in a boat and in the boat he asked Where Is Elder —I said he had made away with himself which was the fact—I knew it from what I was told—I did not see him dead he was buried when I came back—the prisoner said Well I think he is a fool for that he might as well have seen it out —I searched him but found nothing particular—I found some bags at Nahant—I brought the prisoner to Boston—he was locked up and sent before a Ma­ gistrate on Monday morning—after the prisoner was secured I got the carpet bag from the hotel at Nahant—it is the one that has been produced—130 sovereigns were found at Nahant and handed over to me by the American officer—I did not see them found—after taking the prisoner before the Magistrate in America he was entrusted to me to bring to this country—before I came away I obtained possession of 6 500l which I brought over and delivered to the Governor of the Bank of England—I got it from Mr Blatchford agent for Mr Freshfield at New York—I had heard the prisoner say there was money in the Bank—he said the money was in the Merchants Bank at Boston and be should be very glad to sign it over for the Bank of England to have it—I think that was before I had got it but I do not recollect at what part of the transaction—I had no further conversation with him on the subject of the money—I did not go to Nahant with him—I brought him to Boston—I saw Mr Blatchford long before 1 apprehended the prisoner—I had caused notice to be given about the money being taken—I went with Mr Bord and a Judge Warren to the prison the prisoner was in but what passed I do not know—I went to identify Mr Bord as the gentleman representing the Bank of England and after that I received from Mr Blatchford the 6 500l which I brought to England with the 400 and 120 sovereigns Cross-examined Q You were examined before the Lord Mayor A Yes—I believe I did not speak there of any conversation ERNEST SHARP I am a clerk in the Consol-office in the Bank of England my

t18450303-660  660 WILLIAM CASEY alias Bozer alias White alias Smith was indicted for feloniously forging and uttering on the 6th of July 1842 an acceptance to a bill of exchange for 65l with intent to defraud Richard Patterson MESSRS CLARKSON and DOANE conducted the Prosecution RICHARD PATTERSON I was formerly a confectioner living at No 203 Oxford-street I am now messman to the Royal Artillery at Woolwich—I have known the prisoner three or four years—in July 1842 the prisoner was in my debt 20l —in that month he produced this bill of exchange to me to be discounted or to give him the difference of it and take what was owing to me—at the time he brought it me I said You must leave this for inquiry I cannot part with my money in this way I must know who this Samuel Roberts is —I had discounted for the prisoner before but never for an acceptor of the name of Roberts—I said Who is the bill from —he said A gentleman residing at Stafford who resides on his own estate —I said Is it for money or goods —he said For wine I have sold —I first advanced him 20l on the bill for which he gave me this I O U—he left the bill with me—I wrote to Stafford and received an answer—I wrote a second letter to Stafford—this is the letter—it was returned to me as it is now by the post—I received an answer to this letter—before the bill became due I gave the prisoner the difference of the bill—I gave him 15l more after I received the first letter—he owed me 5l and 15l previous to that—he received in all 60l from me and 5l I took for discount—the bill was presented at Cox and Biddulph s where it is made payable but was not paid—in consequence of that and of what I learnt at Cox and Biddulph s I applied for a warrant to apprehend the prisoner and offered a reward for his apprehension—in Dec 1842 about three months after the bill had become due I received this letter—I have seen the prisoner write and had communications with him and have acquired a knowledge of his handwriting—I can swear to this letter being his handwriting— looking at another letter —this is the letter I received in answer to that I wrote to Stafford—I do not know the writer of that nor this— looking at another —it is a fac-simile of the other—I can form no opinion of it The bill was here read dated London the 6th of July 1842 for 65l at two months drawn by William Casey on Mr S Roberts Stafford and accepted by Samuel Roberts payable at Cox and Biddulph s hankers London The I O U was for 20l and was stated to be in part payment of the bill The letter stated to be the prisoner s writing was follows — London Dec 27 1842 Old Blow-hard I have received from four of my friends the Sunday Times wherein you offer 10l reward what a d—d fool you are to imagine that your paltry 10l would induce any person to betray me without they were as big a rogue as yourself Let me advise you to offer 20l and then it may do some good as it would just pay law expenses but in your next advertisement refrain from those lies which you have so barefacedly set forth and state the amount received by me and the amount of the bill-let me advise you to keep that d—d tongue quiet if not look out did you imagine that my wile s relations would pay you if you thought go you are a greater ass than I thought you were but I cannot be surprised at anything you do as you are vagabond enough for anything yours till the next William Casey RICHARD PATTERSON continued I heard nothing more of the prisoner after the receipt of that letter till Aug 1843—in consequence of what I then heard I came to Newgate and saw the prisoner there—he was therein the name of William Smith—I lodged a detainer against him about three or four months after and on the 4th of Feb when he was about to be discharged he was taken on this charge taken before Mr Rawliuson the Magistrate and committed Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q The letter beginning Old Blow-hard was not produced before the Magistrate was it A Yes the prisoner was introduced to me by a friend named Moyce who lives at Islington in the neighbourhood where the prisoner lived—I have beeb somewhat of a sporting man—I was a better on the turf to a certain extent—I did not know the prisoner in that way nor did I know he was a person who betted occasionally—he was introduced to me for the purpose of discounting—that was occasionally my practice when I was a confectioner in Oxford-street—I sometimes got more than five per cent—I should not have been induced to discount this bill had I not believed that the acceptor was a gentleman of large property—I wrote my first letter of inquiry to Stafford on the day the bill was left me—I did not go to Cox and Biddulph s to make any inquiry—I noticed that the bill purported to be payable there—it did not occur to me that I might have made an immediate inquiry there—I have been in the habit of discounting bills for fourteen or sixteen years—I have never been introduced to a Mr Roberts—I have seen many Mr Roberts—I have seen three or four Mr Roberts on the subject of this bill—I have seen one Mr Roberts in the Queen s Bench—I saw him a year and a half ago perhaps—I can t say whether it was before or after I lodged the detainer against the prisoner—it is so long since I cannot remember—when I saw the prisoner in Newgate it was on the morning of his trial or the day before I think it was—I know it was within a day or so—I showed Mr Roberts the letter—I don t think I showed him the note—I had not the note—after seeing Mr Roberts I went to the prisoner s wife—I went several times—perhaps it was a day or two after the bill was dishonoured but I cannot charge my memory—I instructed an attorney of the name of Bentham to write to him—I can t say when that was—I can t tell whether I received a communication from Mr Bentham afterwards—Mr Bentham has left business—I have no recollection of his communicating to me the result of his writing—I can t remember whether it was after or before that that I went to the prisoner s wife—I went to her two or three times—I will swear I did not go a dozen—I went for the purpose of hearing whether she had heard of Casey and whether she knew where he was—that was not after I believed he had committed a forgery—I first ascertained there was no Mr Roberts after the bill was returned into my hands—I then began to be diligent to know what had become of Casey and I found he was in Whitecross-street—I took steps to find him—I looked for the drawer—the acceptor was of no use to me—I looked to the drawer—one was a man I did know and the other I did not know—I cannot tell how long it was before I wrote to Mr Roberts of Stafford—it was no use to write to Stafford because my other letters were returned—my letter that was returned was written on the 13th and it was a fortnight before it came back to me—I wrote to make inquiries at Stafford about a fortnight after the receipt of this perhaps a month after the dishonour of the bill—this letter was returned after I advanced the money before the bill was dishonoured—at the time of the dishonour of the bill I had reason to believe there was no such person as Roberts at Stafford from my letter coming back—I believed at the time the bill was returned to me there was a person named Roberts at Stafford who could pay the bill—I did not apply to any person at Stafford to pay the bill—I made inquiries at Stafford—I could not find the drawer—I continued to look for the prisoner up to the time of his coming here—I did not desire that his wife should pay the money—I applied to her to know where Casey was that I might get the money—I did not threaten criminal proceedings in the event of her not telling roe but in the event of my not finding him—if the money had been sent I should probably not have enforced proceedings—it is not unusual when persons do not honour their bills to grant a little indulgence—I have granted two or three months and longer—I do not know where the Mr Roberts who I saw in the Queen s Bench is now—I have not been looking for him or inquired at the Queen s Bench for him—I had never seen him previously and have not seen him on the turf since MR CLARKSON Q At the time the bill became due did you believe there was a Roberts of Stafford A I did—of course from a former letter that I received I supposed Mr Roberts must have been living there or might have been away from home—I received two letters—I received an answer to one letter THOMAS HAMMERSLEY I am the letter-carrier for the first district of Stafford and have held that situation above seven years—in 1842 there was no person named Samuel Roberts to my knowledge living at Stafford or having any property there nor did I deliver any letter to any such person—there was no such person in my district to my knowledge—this letter with the post-mark of Newcastle-under-Lyne has been returned from there to the dead-letter office London—I see the handwriting of the proper officer upon it Try Potteries —there being no such person in the town of Stafford the clerk would write Try Potteries in Stafford shire—there was not Staffordshire on the letter Cross-examined Q I suppose persons very often direct to Stafford meaning the Potteries A They do—the population of Stafford is about 13 000—there is no attorney named Roberts of Stafford and never was not a resident in the town—there might be a gentleman come the Sessions or Assizes but not a resident—there was no such person in district in July 1842 either as a lodger or in any other way that had any letter—I should not know of all the letters left at the office to be for—I sort a part of the letters MR CLARKSON Q You sort one district and your brother postman the other A Yes—I never delivered any letter to Roberts of Stafford in July 1842—my district contains a divided moiety of the population THOMAS KENDERINE I am the letter-carrier of Stafford for the second district—it is only divided into two districts—in July 1842 there was no such person as Samuel Roberts living in my district in Stafford—I never heard the name—I never delivered a letter to any such name—if such a person had resided in my district I believe I should have known it JOSEPH JONES I am an auctioneer and printer at Stafford In 1842 I was the collector for the whole borough of Stafford—there was no such person as Samuel Roberts living there in that year to my knowledge—if there had been a resident of that name or a person in the ocenpation or possession of a large estate in 1842 I should certainly have know-it—there was none to my knowledge WILLIAM WELLBORNE I am one of the clerks in the banking-house of Messrs Cox and Biddulph In July 1842 we had no customer of the name of Samuel Roberts nor at the time when this bill became due Cross-examined Q I presume that any person might have ascertained that fact by inquiring at your banking-house A Yes we should have answered that of course—it is not usual with us to receive a sum of money from any person to meet a bill—it must have been advised through some banking-house in the country—that is the regular way—if a person came and offered to deposit a sum of money to meet a bill expected to be due we should not receive it having no account of it MR CLARKSON Q That is you would not receive money from a stranger to the house to meet an acceptance A Certainly not WILLIAM CUMMING police-sergeant D 3 On the 4th of Feb I took the prisoner into custody at the House of Correction—I had gone with the prosecutor in 1842 at the latter end of Dec or the 1st of Jan to endeavour to apprehend him at Stafford Newcastle and different places—when I took the prisoner I read the Magistrate s warrant to him—after hearing it read he said There is no forgery Samuel Roberts is well known and he is now in the Queen s Bench prison Cross-examined Q At that time the prisoner had never been out of the custody of the law A No MR BALLANTINE called THOMAS JAMES I am now out of business—I was a publican and kept the Prince Albert in Albert-street City-road—I knew the prisoner before he went to prison—he frequented the house I kept and lived in the same street—I knew a person named Roberts—the prisoner used to call him Sam when they were friendly together—I have often seen them together—Mr Roberts used to come several times and leave notes for Casey and I have seen Casey give him money but what about I do not know—at one time I saw Casey give him fifteen or sixteen sovereigns and he thanked him and all that sort of thing—I do not know what has become of Mr Roberts—I have not seen him lately—the last time I saw him was two years and a half ago for what I know—I did not keep it in my mind—I knew nothing about this till the day before yesterday and then I came in here just by accident as I did to-day hearing the case was coming on—I have not been examined by any attorney for the purpose of giving evidence COURT Q Do you know Roberts handwriting at all A No I do not MR BALLANTINE Q Did you ever see any notes written by him A Yes—I have seen him come when Casey was not there and I have taken pen and ink into the parlour to him—I have no recollection of his handwriting from that—it was a smallish hand a good bit of a hand according to what I have seen of it—I have no judgment or belief about his handwriting to swear to it—I could tell very near I think to the best of my recollection but it is a long time ago—the acceptance to this bill of exchange looking at it is something like it—it is a small hand as I say—it is something like it but I cannot swear to it COURT Q Have you seen enough of Roberts handwriting to form an opinion what is or is not his writing A On my word I cannot say—I dare say he has left twenty or thirty little notes at our house—I have not looked at them—I had no occasion to have my attention directed to them particularly to see what they were MR BALLANTINE Q Then am I to understand you to have any belief about this A Well as I said before it is a very small hand something like it—whether it is it or not I cannot say MR CLARKSON Q When were you sent for to come here A I was not sent for at all—I was at my old house last Wednesday and heard the parties in the room speaking about this a public party—I was sitting by the attorney just now quite by accident—I am out of business now—I have got money enough out of my business to keep me at present till I can get another house—I left it last Tuesday three weeks—I think you know how long I was there for you were counsel for me in opposing the beer-shop at the corner—I have been there four years GUILTY of Uttering Aged 30 — Transported for Seven Years

did—he asked if I would put on hisleathef apron which he took off—I did so—he said it would make me look like a shop-boy—I did not think that odd—he told me to go and fetch the stoves from Mr Kennard

March Henry Cook brought this order—it was presented to me at the desk—I Immediately discovered it to be a forgery indeed I knew the writer—I directed two or three stoves to be lowered into a truck

handwriting—this is not his WILLIAM WARD I am a stove-manufacturer and live in Tottenharn-street—this paper was not signed by me or by my authority JAMES JANSON City policeman No 483 In consequence at

identified by Mr Fimister Allen Q What clothes did I wear when I was taken A A black frock coat and a hat—on taking Ashley next day I asked him whose cap he had got—he said Allen s—I asked whose the

bad imitation of my handwriting—I never received the value of these checks from the prisoner or gave him any authority to get the money on them—I have had opportunities of seeing him write—I cannot say that these checks are his writing—I cannot form any belief on the subject Cross-examined Q How soon after he came into your service did you begin to employ him to take checks to Piper s to get cashed A I should think eighteen months—I do not put any number on the checks or margins—I sometimes sent him with a check to Mr Piper s once a week sometimes onee in two weeks—very seldom twice in one week—I did not discover anything wrong till the 12th of April as I did not have my book made up till then—we have offices in London—I think I was in London on the 18th of April the day before the prisoner s last examination—and about eleven o clock I saw the prisoner s aunt near St James s church—I asked her if she was going to see the prisoner—I do not remember asking her to get what information she could out of him—I told her to ask him how he had squandered the money—I did not say that at the trial I would recommend him to mercy—I keep no clerks—only a maid-servant had access to the place where the check-books were kept—there is no shop it is a counting-house—bill-stickers and porters come to the counting-house occasionally THOMAS PIPER JUN I keep the Feathers at Old Brentford—I have been in the habit of cashing small checks for King and Son from time to to time—the prisoner always brought them—I was in the habit of paying to Mr Baker of Chiswick the checks I received from the prisoner except one which I paid to Mr John Dicker of Cooper s-row Tower-hill—this check dated the 24th of Jan I paid to some of the collectors but whether it was to Mr Baker or not I do not know—I received it from the prisoner for I never received a check signed King and Son from any one else—if any of the collectors called in and I had a check by me I always paid it away—I know Mr Baker s handwriting—I believe the indorsement on this check is his handwriting—these two other checks also came to me through the prisoner s hands—I paid them to Mr Baker—I do not remember the date of receiving this particular check—there is no memorandum of my own on it—they were always brought on the day they were dated—I have from time to time observed the ink wet upon them Cross-examined Q You have no recollection of the bringing of this particular check A No but I swear I took it of the prisoner—I can speak to three checks from the formation of the B in Brentford—I know this by the formation of the letters at the top—I recognised it the moment it was put into my hands—there are three checks which have a particular B—one B is written very badly one with blue ink and the third is different from the others—the bad B is on the check of Dec 5 —I know the check in question by the Jan in January—I recollect cashing that particular check—no one cashes checks or handles money but myself—I am sure I have seen this check before—my attention has been called to it before—my opinion was the same then that it is now—the prisoner did not frequent my house to drink—I never saw him with money— looking at his deposition —this is my handwriting—it was read over to me before I signed it— the deposition being read stated I believe I cashed the whole of the five checks for the prisoner but I am quite sure as to the one dated Dec 5 for 5l and the one dated Feb 7 for 5l —I pointed out three checks at the time I was examined—I have no hesitation in swearing that I cashed this check dated 24th Jan —I noticed the B in Brentford and the Jan in Jan at the office MR CLARKSON Q When you paid these cheeks to Mr Baker wis it your practice to see him endorse them A Always—I cannot say that I saw him endorse this ROBERT BAKIR I am clerk and collector to Messrs Fuller brewers of Chiswick This check dated 24th of Jan 1845 I received from Mr Piper in part payment of his account—I wrote his name on it at the time and I believe in his presence—here is my writing and also on these other two which I also received from him for his account—I paid them into the Regent-street branch of the Union Bank—I cannot exactly recollect the day I paid them in JOHN HAYNES I am an inspector of the detective police By direction of Cocks and Co I made inquiries about some forged checks and in consequence of those inquiries I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th of April in Mr King s back yard at work—I told him what he was charged with and cautioned him—he stud he had changed no checks except at Mr Piper s and the whole of the checks he had changed there he had received from his master Mr King—Mr King jun was present—before I took the prisoner into custody I asked him to write his name and also the name of Mr King from which I formed an opinion—I produce the book in which he wrote Cross-examined Q How came you to get him to sign his name A I asked him to sign it—I went in plain clothes—I did not tell him I was a policeman—I did not ask him if he did not want a better situation and if he could write—I asked if he could write his name and gave him my book—Mr King went with me—I said Is this your young man —he said Yes and I immediately said Can you write —after I had taken the prisoner to the station I went to the prisoner s mother—I did not tell her I was sent by the prisoner for the last copy-book that he had at school—I said I understood from the prisoner that there was a pocket-book of his in the house—he had told me so—I mentioned a copy-book—I did not say I had been sent for it—I swear I said nothing about school—the mother said there was no such thing in the house—I very likely said I believed the boy better than her for he had told me it was in the box—I believe I asked how much money he had in the box—I was told he had not any—I looked in his box and there was not any—I asked where he bought his clothes—I was not satisfied from what I found that they had been paid for weekly—I was satisfied that his mother had pledged his coat and his sister his trowsers without his knowledge MR CLARKSON Q How long have you been an inspector of the detective force A Since its establishment in 1843 I have been in the police thirteen years REGINALD THISTLETHWAITS COCKS I am one of the firm of Cocks Biddulph and Co It consists of more than two

among other things owed a coal bill which I have sometime since been summoned for but which through the man s insolence I swore I never would pay A few words ensued between me and my landlord last week and we agreed to move we were doing so this day Thursday when suddenly our goods were seized for the coal bill and expenses in all 3l It so happens that I have no money in Mrs Rogers s hands We

send our love &c Please direct the letter to Mr E Cooper at Mr Jackson s 82 Friar-street Blackfriars-road London —dated 4th June post-mark 5th June —in consequence of receiving this letter I went to the post-office at Hadleigh and procured a post-office order for 1l —this is it—I enclosed it in a letter addressed as requested in the letter—I sealed it paid 1d and put it in the post-office myself—I never heard from my son acknowledging the receipt I wrote again to another place where he had lived and this was discovered ALFRED ELLESDEN I am a clerk in the post-office at Hadleigh—on the 7th of June I gave the last witness this order for 1l —it contains the name of the person to whom the money is to be paid-we sent a letter of advice containing the name of the person to receive the

advice Received the above Edward Cooper Witness At the time the order was sent the receipt at the bottom had no name to it GEORGE HAZLETON I am a letter—carrier of the General Post-office—Friar-street Blackfriars-road is in my delivery—I recollect about the 7th or 8th of June having a letter to deliver for Mr Cooper at Mr Jackson s Friar-street Blackfriars-road—I cannot recollect the day—it was the only letter I had by that name—I went to the house with the letter and saw Mrs Stanley there—while I was inquiring for Mr Cooper the prisoner came up-to the best of my belief he is the man—I cannot swear to him positively—he asked me if I had a letter for Mr Cooper—I said I had—I had just givea it into Mrs Stanley s hand—she gave it to the man and he went away—to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man—he met me at the door—I asked him if he was Mr Cooper—he said he was—he was two or three minutes under my sight—I have no doubt of his being the person—I never saw him before to my recollection—I had no reason to suspect him JOHN MASTERS KING I am a clerk in the Money Order Office at the Post-office—this advice was in the office—a person applied for the money mentioned in that advice and gave me this order dated 7th June No 169—I paid the money upon it on the 9th of June—the name of Edward Cooper was signed to it—it was given me by the person to whom I paid the money—I have no idea who the man was who gave it to me—I do not know whether he signed the receipt when he was there or whether he brought it signed but it was signed or I should not have given him the money EDWARD COOPER Jun I am the son of Mr Cooper In the beginning of last month I lived at No 97 Broadwall Stamford-street—I did not live at No 82 Friar-street and had no knowledge of anybody there—this letter is not my handwriting nor was it written by my authority—I knew nothing of it till the discovery took place—I have known the prisoner about seven years through his being apprenticed to my wife s father—he had an opportunity of knowing my handwriting—he knew my father lived at Hadleigh and the circumstances of my family—I had seen him a few months before this matter occurred—I am acquainted with his handwriting—I believe this letter to be his handwriting—I have seen him write repeatedly—the signature to this receipt is not mine—I believe that likewise to be the prisoner s—I never authorized him to write or sign it Prisoner I never saw his handwriting Witness I am sure he has seen me write—I bought a clock and several things of him and gave him my I O U for a few shillings and he was present when I wrote it—I do not remember any other instance of his seeing me write MR BODKIN Q Is that letter like your handwriting A Not the letter—the signature is an attempt to copy my handwriting FANNY COOPER I am the wife of last witness The prisoner was apprenticed to my father whose name is Camp—I have seen him write very often—I believe this letter to be his handwriting—I have no doubt at all about it—I believe the signature Edward Cooper to this order alto to be his handwriting—the prisoner knew where we lived—he knew my father-in-law by seeing him at our house and knew our circumstances WILLIAM CAMP The prisoner was my apprentice and was with me seven years—during that time I had frequent opportunities of seeing him write—I believe this letter to be his handwriting—it certainly is his—I have no doubt of it—the signature to the receipt is also his writing although done with a trembling hand WILLIAM STEEL I live at No 82 Friar-street Blackfriars-road I have known the prisoner about twelve months—in the early part of June I lived at the same house under the name of Jackson—the prisoner was aware of that JURY Q Did you know of the letter coming A I had not the slightest idea—I never gave the slightest permission about it—I had not a farthing of the money—I never knew he got it until I was told of this Prisoner s Defence I never wrote the letter to Hadleigh and never received the money I did not know the direction to write as to the Post-office order I never had one in my hand and never saw one the writing is not mine I never saw it to know whether it is like mine I never signed anybody s name but my own to any letter I ever wrote MATTHEW PEEK I produce a certificate of the prisoner s former conviction from Mr Clark s office—

of stating the charge MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution ABRAHAM WILDEY ROBARTS ESQ I am one of the firm of Robarti Curtis and Co hankers in London There are three partners besides myself—Mr Richard Latham has been a customer of our house for many years—this letter marked D and the bill enclosed in it marked C wat brought to our house on the 30th of Dec last—it was brought to me by our head clerk and I sanctioned the discounting of it—no bill would be discounted without my sanction GEORGE HENRY BRACKETT I am clerk in the house of Robarts and Co On the 30th of Dec last I received instructions to enter this bill—it was discounted by the direction of my superiors Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you pay the money A No—I made out a ticket and gave it to the cashier to pay the money—the person waiting for the discounting of the bill was in the passage—I saw him MR BODKIN Q I believe you have no recollection whatever of the person A Not at all—it was a man ROBERT MORRIS I am cashier to Messrs Robarts and Co On the 30th of Dec last I paid the money upon this 150l bill of exchange—I have an entry here of the notes I paid one 100l note No 11 504 dated 9th of Oct one 40l No 60 554 dated 7th of May and one 5l No 15 486 dated 3rd of Oct —these are the three notes I paid— looking at them ALEXANDER ROBERTSON I am clerk in the issue department of the Bank of England On the 30th of Dec last I paid gold for these three notes—it is the custom to require the name and address of the party applying—the name of John Jones 12 Lower Eaton-street Pimlico appears on these notes—I do not remember whether I saw that written Cross-examined Q What time of day were they paid in A In the afternoon—I have no doubt there were other clerks in the office at the time—the person presenting the notes stands in front MR BODKIN Q A good many persons come to change notes A Several hundreds in the course of a day—I cannot at all remember the features of the person DENNIS M DONALD I am the manager of a Loan office in St John-street Clerkenwell I have known the prisoner three or four years and have transacted loans for him—I have seen him write received letters from him and had opportunities of becoming acquainted with his handwriting—I believe this bill of exchange to be the prisoner s handwriting also this letter and the name and address on these notes I also believe to be his writing Cross-examined Q Did you know him as a cab proprietor A Yes and before he was a cab proprietor—I have understood from him lately that he has had two or three cabs—I was not acquainted with his circumstances except from himself—he is not at all in my debt now—believe the whole of this bill of exchange to be his handwriting both the signatures of Joseph Smith and Richard Latham and also the endorsement of Joseph Smith I believe it all to be the same handwriting—I found my opinion on the general appearance of the writing—I could not undertake to describe it—I have a perfect recollection of the first letter J on the bank-notes—the letters are a facsimile of writing I have seen of his—I cannot describe the formation of his capital E or S in fact I could not describe a letter of my own but I know the writing when I see it—there is that variation in his writing which a difference of pen may make I know of no other—I was first called on on this subject about three months ago by Forrester—he did not tell me he had taken the prisoner into custody on a charge of forgery—he did not show me these instruments then—he showed me a 50l note with my andwriting upon it—he showed me these some week or two after it may be three—I do not know that he showed me them at all—I have seen them but whether in the hands of Forrester or another person I cannot tell—I do not think he did show me these bills—I think Mr Bush did—the prisoner was not taken into custody when Forrester first saw me—when he showed me the note he asked me if I knew the writing and the person s address and it was from that address that he arrested the prisoner—it was before he was taken into custody that I was shown these notes and the bill and after Forrester had shown me the 50l note—I have been shown other notes as well— looking at some writing on the outside of the letter —I should not think this was the prisoner s writing HENRY FLEAR I am clerk in the Loan-office in St John-street-road I have known the prisoner from two and a half to three years—I have seen him write and am acquainted with his handwriting—I believe the whole of this bill marked C to be the prisoner s handwriting decidedly—I have the same opinion of the letter marked D—the name of John Jones Lower Eaton-street Pimlico on these three notes I believe to be the prisoner s handwriting Cross-examined Q Of course you have seen the prisoner write very often A Not very often—I cannot state more than twice—I have frequently seen him on the subject of letters that he has written—on one occasion when I saw him write he took down the name and address and number of the cab &c of a person in the same line of business as himself about whom we wished him to make some inquiries—I saw him write that—Mr Macdonald did not write those particulars—he was present but the prisoner wrote it on a slip of paper which he took away MR DOANE Q What was the other occasion on which you saw him write A When he endorsed a bill—I have not seen him write at other times but I have seen letters of his and frequently acted upon them GEORGE HENRY BRACKETT re-examined This letter came to our house on the 16th of Sept 1843—a 150l bill was inclosed in it which we discounted that day—it was drawn by Mr Latham on Mr Smith—I gave a memorandum to the cashier Mr Morris to pay that bill—I have here a memorandum in my own handwriting referring to a bill of 75l of the 9th of March 1844 drawn by the same party on the same party—that bill was discounted by our house on that day—I paid it with five 10l notes Nos 23929 to 33 dated 3rd Feb 1844 and four 5l notes Nos 44239 to 42 dated 1st Feb 1844—this is the letter marked E that came with that 75l bill—I made this calculation of the interest on the back of it ROBERT MORRIS re-examined I paid the 150l bill on the 16th of Sept 1843 less the interest with two 50l notes Nos 24667 and 68 dated 6th July 1843 and four 5l notes Nos

house on the 29th of July 1844—it was discounted on that day—I did not pay the money HENRY BARRON I am a cashire at Messrs Robarts On the 29th of July 1844 I paid the discount of this 350l bill with a

gave gold for these 30l and 5l notes—I did not take the numbers—I took the name of the person who gave them to me—I find the name of John Thomas Jones 20 Ebury-street Pimlico on this 30l note—I took that name down in a book from the note—the number is 27794 and the date is 6th March 1844—the number of the 5l note is 17099 and the date 2nd July 1844 and it has the same name and address FREDERICK WILLIAM BRACKETR I am in the employ of Messrs Robarts and Curtis On the 5th of Sept 1844 two bills of exchange one for 150l and one for 75l which had been discounted by our house were taken up and withdrawn—they were the two bills which have been spoken to the letters inclosing which have been produced—they were not then due—this letter marked F came to our house on the 5th of Sept on the subject of withdrawing those bills—I did not receive it myself—I found it on the file upon which we deposit our letters—I received these bank notes in payment of those bills two 100l notes Nos 65231 and 05232 dated 9th May 1844 one 20l note No 13233 dated 5th June 1844 and one for 5l No 51957 dated 2nd July 1844—these are the same notes—the numbers correspond DENNIS M DONALD re-examined This letter marked E relating to the 75l bill I believe to be the handwriting of the prisoner On the 16th of Sept 1843 the prisoner paid me this 50l Bank of England note—I wrote on it at the time the prisoner s name the date of the month sod year and my own name—I find that on this note—I received it personally from him Cross-examined Q Do you recollect in Jan this year hating any transaction for loans with the prisoner A I cannot recollect particularly in Jan —I have none of my books here—some four months ago I lent him about 12l —I have no recollection of lending him any other money this year—there are no other persons in the office that lend money—I have lent him 5l on many occasions—I cannot recollect whether I lent him 5l in Jan —if he asked me I should have done it—I do not recollect what time of day this 50l note was brought to me—I am quite certain I received it from the prisoner—he owed me a great deal more but I do not think he paid so much as that—I cannot recollect what be owed me at that time—I gave him something out of the 50l —he never paid me so much as 50l at one time—the 12l I lent him four months ago has been repaid MR BODKIN Q Look at the name of Pitt Drummond-street Euston-square on the back of this other 50l note A I cannot form any opinion about that—I have no recollection that the prisoner ever lived in Drum-mond-street—the name of Turner and the address on these 10l and 5l notes I believe to be the prisoner s handwriting—the name and address of John Thomas Jones 20 Ebury-street Pimlico on this 300l 30l and 5l notes I believe to be the prisoner s handwriting—this 350l bill and this letter marked B I believe to be the prisoner s handwriting also this letter marked F MR BALLANTINE Q How many letters have you received from the prisoner A Several—I cannot say how many—I have not kept any—I have none of his handwriting here—I have at home applications for loans and promissory notes which have been paid but not taken away HENRY FLEAR re-examined This letter marked E I believe to be the prisoner s handwriting—the name of Pitt on this 50l note I believe to be the prisoner s writing notwithstanding its being illegible—it is very illegible—the names of John and Joseph Turner on these 10l and 5l notes I believe to be the prisoner s handwriting with the addresses Cross-examined Q The word Pitt is in your opinion in the prisoner s writing A It is and Drummond-street likewise—I have not perhaps so strong a belief upon that as the other but I believe it very much resembles the prisoner s handwriting—I am nineteen years old—I have been three years in the Loan-office before that I was in a law stationer s office MR BODKIN Q As a law stationer do you necessarily see a good many different forms of handwriting A Yes—I can form no opinion as to the words Euston-square —I believe all the rest to be in his handwriting—the name John Thomas Jones on these three notes the 300l 30l and 5l I believe to be the prisoner s handwriting and the addresses also—this 350l and the letters accompanying it marked B I believe to be the prisoner s handwriting also this letter marked F JOHN WAITE MURPHY I am clerk to Messrs Bush and Mullens I served a notice on the prisoner last Session to produce the two bills of exchange spoken of—I also served one yesterday—I have a copy of the notice Cross-examined Q Were you at the Mansion-house attending the examination A Yes—Mr Duncombe a solicitor attended on the part of the prisoner—Mr Bush attended on the part of the prosecution—Mr Duncombe requested that the prisoner s friends might be permitted to see the forged documents—Mr Bush refused to allow it unless in his presence ind he had an opportunity of cross-examining them—he would not allow them to see them unless they were brought and sworn before the Lord Mayor and examined upon them MR BODKIN Q The bills were then before the Lord Mayor the subject of this charge A Yes—Mr Bush proposed that any witness might see them and be examined as to their belief or not in the presence of the Lord Mayor RICHARD LATHAM ESQ I reside at Queen s-road Bayswater I was formerly a partner in the house of Meux and Co —I kept an account at Robarts and Curtis and have continued to do so up to the present time—the prisoner was in my service about ten years ago and looked after a pony of mine—he has not worked for me siuce—his father has—I understand the prisoner has been driving a cab lately and his father also—the father was employed by me some few months ago and has been for thirty years—at the time the prisoner lived with me I had an account at Robarts s and sometimes drew checks on that house—the prisoner had no opportunity of knowing that—at that time I used to pay all my tradesmen s bills with checks but lately I have not drawn for less than 100l at a time—I never gave the prisoner a check—he did not live in my house—I believe he lived with his father—I do not think I ever sent any of the small checks to the tradesmen by any of my servants—this bill and letter marked C and D are not my writing and were not written by my authority or knowledge—this other letter is not my writing—it is dated from my right address Queen s-road Bayswater—this 350l bill is not my writing nor the letter that accompanied it—it is a forgery—I know nothing of this letter marked F—I never sent any of these bills to Robarts s house to discount for me—I have not given them a bill for the last seven years—I know nothing of this letter marked E—I have lived in Queen R-road Bayswater upwards of thirty years—I had a place in town but the prisoner did not live at all with me there—he was employed at Bayswater—I have a friend named Joseph Smith—I was not acquainted with him at the time the prisoner lived with me—he lives in Gray s Inn—I have been acquainted with him many years but not in habits of intimacy as I am now—he has been in the habit of coming to my house in Queen s-road for the last four or five years I should suppose—the prisoner s father was in my employment at that time Cross-examined Q When the prisoner was in your employment he was a mere lad A He was—I had no fault to find with him—I have not charged any other person with having committed these forgeries—I may have thought others were about me as well—my suspicions have not been excited as to any other person—I have no suspicion of any other individual—I have not charged any other individual in any shape or way—I cannot tell you what has been operating on my mind but I have suspected no one—there were persons that might know my affairs very well but I have not suspected them JOSEPH SMITH ESQ I am a barrister living in Gray s Inn I hare been acquainted with Mr Latham for a great many years—my name to this 150l bill marked C is not my handwriting—I never authorised anybody to sign it for me—I know nothing about it—my name to this other bill is not my handwriting nor written by my authority—I never drew a bill on Mr Latham in my life—I have been in the habit of visiting him at Bayswater frequently—I am not conscious of ever having seen the prisoner before today—I have frequently seen the father there JOHN FORRESTER I am an

the prisoner ever lived in Drummond-street—I have heard so Cross-examined Q You know where he lives now A Yes with his father—I have had these notes in my possession—I have taken them to show the prisoner s handwriting to about three or four persons perhaps more—I do not see any of those persons here today except Mr M Donald and Mr Flear—I cannot say whether the bills and letters have been in my brother s possession DANIEL FORRESTER I am an officer of the City of London On the 22nd of May I saw the prisoner in Bouverie-street Paddington—I stopped him and asked if his name was Thomas Peat—he said Yes —I told him he was charged with uttering three forged bills—he paused for half t minute or a minute and said How do they make out it is me —I had not then given him any particulars of the bills—I told him that his name appeared on some of the notes—he said That cannot be —I told him the bills had been uttered at Robarts and Curtis —he said I never was there —my brother came up just at the time—I then told him who I was and he must come into the City with me—we all came together—I had seen the name of Peat on a note—I cannot say what note it was—I do not think I had made any inquiry in Drummond-street before I saw the prisoner—I had seen this 50l bill which has the name of Peat on it written by Mr M Donald The documents were here read as follows —A bill marked C dated 28th Dec 1844 for 150l at six months drawn by Joseph Smith on Richard Latham Queens-road Bayswater Letter D Saturday Dec 28 1844 65 Queen s-road Bayswater Messrs Robarts —Please to discount the enclosed bill of exchange bearing my signature for bearer and you will oblige yours &c R LATHAM The letter marked E accompanying the 75l bill was similar The 350l bill was dated 27th July 1844 at nine months drawn by Joseph Smith on Richard Latham and the letter enclosing it to Messrs Robarts purported to be from Mr La-thorn Letter F Queen s-road Bayswater Sept 4 1844 Messrs Robarts and Co —Please to return to me by bearer the two bills of exchange discounted for me by your house and bearing my acceptance both being drawn by Mr Joseph Smith one for 75l at six months after date dated 9th March 1844 and one for 150l at twelve months after date dated Sept 1843 As I am about leaving town for a short time I may be out of the way when they become due as the time is so near I should prefer having them before I leave which will greatly oblige Yours &c R LATHAM GUILTY Aged 25 — Transported for Life 
t18450818-1610  1610 EZRA BASS and ELIZA NEWTON were indicted for feloniously forging and uttering a receipt for 44l 19s 2d with intent to defraud Samuel Allen and others to which BASS pleaded GUILTY Aged 19 — Transported for Life MR DOANE conducted the Prosecution FREDERICK JAMES FULLER I am secretary and weekly auditor of the Paddington Savings Bank I remember a person named Henry Mitchell becoming a depositor in the bank on the 7th of Dec 1844—I find an entry of eight deposits altogether—I entered the first myself—on the 9th of June 1845 the prisoner Newton brought Mitchell s pass-book to have 2l entered—I have seen her three or four times at the bank but cannot say when—her face was familiar to me—a notice was given to withdraw the deposits which would expire on Monday the 30th of June—I was on doty then and had the money ready—the two prisoners came to the bank and this pass-book was presented as usual—it was Mitchell s pass-book— we take the signatures of depositors in a book when they first make a deposit and enter where they live their occupation and age—that forms a check against wrong persons coming —Bass signed the acquittance-book Newton standing by him tt the time—upon looking at the original signa-ture I said to Bass You occasionally alter your handwriting a little pray how old are you —he said Twenty-five —that might correspond with the original entry of Mitchell s age which was stated at twenty-four at the time of signing—Newton then turned round and said You are not quite twenty-five recollect —I then said Pray where do you live and directly those words were out of my mouth Newton turned round again and said No 7 Welling s-place which corresponded with the original entry—I said Have the goodness to stand back a little let him answer for himself—she retired a step or two back—I then took a a slip of paper and said Have the goodness to write your name over again as you formerly wrote it —he wrote it twice if not three times which satisfied me as far as that went that it was the person who originally deposited the monies and to the best of my belief I asked bin What trade are you —his answer was A sawyer 11—I then signed my name to an order to the cashier to pay the money—Samuel Allen is one of the trustees of the bank and there are several others—the amount was 44l 19s 2d Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you know anything of Newton A No—I was the party who took the signature on the 7th of Dec —I believe Bass repeated No 7 Welling s-place after Newton—I have stated all that Newton said SASMUEL ALLEN I am one of the trustees of the bank I paid the 44l 19s 2d on this occasion HENRY MITCHELI I am a sawyer and live at No 7 Welling s-place I became a depositor in the Paddington Savings Bank in Dec 1844—this is my book—I made the first payment myself—at that time I was living with the female prisoner as my wife—we had lived together some years—I have entrusted her with the book at times to make additional deposits—I never authorized her to draw out any of the money—I did not authorize her on the 30th of June to draw out 44l 19s 2d nor to sign my name to this book—this signature is not my handwriting—I did not authorize anybody to sign this for me—the male prisoner lodged with me for about three weeks and left a fortnight and two days before the 30th of June—Newton had access to the book—it was left in a drawer in my room which was not locked Cross-examined Q Who do you work for A Mr Biddle in King-street—I have 30s a week for six days but make eight days some weeks and get extra pay—I have not received only 24s a week within the last four years—I may have worked at that rate but always received more—I think it is about seven years since I first became acquainted with Newton—I am not certain whether she was in a situation at the time—shehad been in service at Elizabeth-grove and had just left—I cannot say how old she was at the time—I did not get her away from the place—I cannot say how long she had left—I think it was more than one day—I am certain I did not take her the very day she left—I will not swear it—I cannot swear how many children I have had by her—there were three Q Who left them with the mother was it a sawyer named Mitchell A I believe it was—I never deserted her nor left her at all—I was it home with the children—I swear I was at home when she went out that evening—I did not know where she was going—the children lived at my house—she might have a few shillings or 1l when she left her place—she had no money to place in the bank—I swear I never saw any of her money—she never brought me any Q Has she ever left her home or her children till you cause her to be taken into custody A No she never did and she has always been the reverse to this till this happened—I cannot say that there has been any misconduct between her and Bass—I swear none of the money was her earnings—it was my hard earnings—I represented her as ray wife and believe it did slip out at Marylebone-office that she was my wife—I afterwards told the truth—that was a week after—I have been receiving from my master 38s and 39s a week—I had her and two children to keep—I believe the other child died when it was seven months old—the oldest is five years old—the other I think three years last May—we had a few words about a fortnight previous to this—I never left her I swear nor threatened to leave her or the children—my sister has now charge of the children and my money has been keeping them—I left Mrs West my sister in the house with them a fortnight after the prisoner was in custody—Newton did not go to the police to complain that Bass had robbed her of her money—it was me and Mrs West COURT Q Did she earn anything while living with you A She has not earned anything for twelve months—she never went out to a day s work—she learned the stay business and made some stays—I was at work all day and best part of the night—she attended to the lodgers The receipt was here

t18450818-1625  1625 WILLIAM COLEMAN BALLS was indicted for feloniously forging and uttering an acquittance and receipt for 30l with intent to defraud John Randall and others —Two other COUNTS with intent to defraud George Selby and others MR BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution JOHN RANDALL I am steward to the United Brothers Provident Society held at the City of London public-house Sidney-street City-road—in the beginning of 1844 the prisoner was secretary to the society and bad been so I think about five years—it was the duty of the steward to keep the books of the society—I was steward at the time—it was the prisoner s duty to make the entries in the books—there was a minute—book kept and a depositor s book—this is the minute-book—the depositor s book we have been unable to find—there is a resolution entered in the minute—book on the ht of Jan 1844 in the prisoner s handwriting that the senior steward in conjunction with the secretary should add the interest to the principal in the savings bank—I went on the 2nd of Jan with the prisoner to the savings bank for that purpose and made the necessary arrangements—I think the principal and interest when added up was 52l odd—I saw the prisoner produce the depositor s book at the bank—I believe it was the duty of the steward to take care of that book but the prisoner had always been in the habit of having it—it was returned into his hand at the bank with the minute-book and I have never seen it since—I never asked the prisoner for it—here is an entry in the minute-book of the 5th of Feb 1844* in the prisoner s handwriting J Randall deposited the bank book in the book —there was a conversation with the prisoner afterwards about that entry and he said he must have made a mistake he must have meant box—I never did deposit the bank book in the box—I first found it was not in the box on the 2nd of June 1845—he always had possession of the minute—book—I do not know the exact number of books we had altogether—there were only two required at the bank the minute and depositor s or bank book which is a book of receipt from the bankers—I believe the prisoner is a compositor and printer—I have frequently seen him write and know his handwriting— looking at the receipt for 30l in the bank-book I believe the signature of William Jones to be the prisoner s handwriting—we have a William Jones in our society—the prisoner had no authority from our society to draw out that money—if we had wanted it I should have been appointed to receive it Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q How long had you been steward before the 1st of Jan A That was my first entry—I remained steward three months—it is not a rule that the stewards for the time being should have possession of the books—we never had possession of them—there were other books besides the minute-book and the bank-book but I cannot mention their names—I do not know the committee-book by name—I have known of another minute-book since but not before—we call it another minute-book—we have no right to have two minute-books—this is it— looking of a book labelled Committee-book —lhere is no entry in it after the 5th of Feb 1844—I see here an entry of 18th Dec 1844—we knew nothing of the way in which he managed the books they were done in such a strange way—here is an entry of my going to the bank with him made almost at the beginning of the book—here is an entry— 1845 J Randall Sept 29th 7s 6d ditto 12s &c —that is money I was receiving when 1 was sick—those entries are not made under the direction of the steward—the secretary makes them of his own option—he knows what to put down—the stewards draw the money from the landlord and pay it to the sick members—the secretary gets the account from the landlord s book which we sign for his security—I have seen this book before but never examined it par-ticularly—the other stewards had also an opportunity of seeing it—I believe the minute-book was generally on the table every night of meeting—the books were kept in the box but this book the prisoner had in his pos-session—it has never been kept in the box since 1 have been there—there were three keys belonging to the box in which the bank-book was kept—the prisoner had neither of those keys—the two stewards had each one and the landlord one each for a different lock so that all three keys must be there to open the box—James Andrews was my fellow-steaard and Hume Graddon but he was not a free steward—we always kept the bank-book in the box till it was taken to the bank—our accounts were generally made up and balanced in Dec —this book does not contain the receipts and expenditure it is called Receipts and Expenditure-book —here is an entry Balance to treasurer —we were never aware that this book contained any entry of the sort—it was a larger book in which that was entered—this is the book—this other was expressly for a minute-book—I never examined to see whether it was marked with receipts and expendi-ture—nothing but minutes of meetings had any business in it—I have belonged to the society rather better than five years—here is a minute in the book authorizing me to proceed to the bank Q How often were you in the habit of going to the bank to have the interest added up in order that it might become principal A It used to be done once in six months but lately once in twelve—I am not aware when it was done before Feb 5th 1844—it was not my duty after April to examine any of the books—I do not recollect who succeeded me in office Q Look at that entry does it not follow in the same handwriting and in the same ink as the entry above it J Randall deposited the bank-book in the box A It could not have been so—the handwriting is all one and the ink may have been all one for what I know—I do not think any of us ever looked at the minute-book—we trusted too much to the prisoner—we had a steward s book in which we kept an account against him of what members paid and what they did not pay—the name of William Jones is not in the notice only in the receipt—I believe it to be the prisoner s writing—the W and J are like his—he sometimes signed his own name William and sometimes W only—my attention was called to this receipt some time in June last MR BALLANTINE Q I believe that is a blank depositor s book producing one A Yes—the minute-book was entirely in the prisoner s keeping—I never noticed it before and never observed the words re-ceipts and expenditure on it MR O BRIEN Q Look at that book labelled Committee-book and see whether that is not the minute-book A was never aware we had such a book—this has got minutes in it like the other book—it is in the prisoner s handwriting MR BALLANTINE Q Is this named Committee-book by yon or pasted on by the prisoner A It is a name that he gave it—I believe the whole of this to be the prisoner s writing—this general meeting &c 9th of June was the last writing I saw him make—the name of Jones if in that—it is nothing like the signature to the receipt—it is a different handwriting—I have been in the habit of seeing him write for about five yean—if the depositor s book had been put back into the box after being de-livered to the prisoner at the Bank he would not have been able to get it without the knowledge of the three persons who had keys THOMAS NIXEY In Jan and Feb 1844 I was a manager of the Finsbury Savings-bank—the Birmingham United Brothers Society banked with us—before they took out their money it would be necessary that a notice should be sent—I find such a notice in our Notice and Repay-ment book on the 14th of Feb 1844—we have certain numbers in our book and also in the depositor s book held by the customer—the number referred to tells me whether or not it is a right account—I attended on the 21st of Feb —I find on that date this receipt Finsbury-bank for savings We the undersigned do hereby acknowledge the receipt of the sums annexed to our respective names this 21st of Feb 1844 and under the No 9 are the names William Nash Thomas Bond and William or Willan Jones —three persons must have been present to have signed that or I should not have given the check—we require the presence of all the three parties signing as they do at the Bank for a transfer of stock and upon their signing I give a check which is paid by another person—the depositor s book is essential to be produced—it gives me the clue where to look and also where I am to refer for the amount I have to pay—I then take their names and I have their minute-book before me at the same time to see that the signatures are the same as I have taken—we do not require the same signatures to the notice that we do to the re-ceipt—I do not know the persons signing the receipt only from the minute-book and the Secretary comes—I find their handwriting in the minute-book—with reference to this particular transaction I do not remember the production of the minute-book at all—it would certainly not have been paid unless the minute-book had been shown—there is only the name of Thomas Bond in the notice—I paid a check of 30l to the persons signing the receipt—here are my initials both in the book and on the check—I should not have given the check until I had seen the depositor s book—I personally do every act myself before I part with the check Cross-examined Q You have no recollection of this particular traos-action except by referring to this book and judging of your usual regu-larity A Certainly not—we require the depositor s book both when notice is given and also when the money is paid—as far as I recollect it is invariably present when the money is paid—I cannot say that in no one instance has money been paid without it because I do not pay all the money—I firmly believe I never gave a check without the minute-book being produced—I do not think it is at all possible I should give a check without the minute-book being before me—I did not receive the notice—I do not know whether the depositor s book and minute-book were produced then—I do not recollect any transaction with this Society before—I could not swear that I compared the signatures in this book with those in the minute-book on this occasion—most likely I did—I cannot recollect parti-cularly as to this single transaction but it is the usual practice to do so and I should expect I did so then—I gave the check to one of the three persons who signed—the secretary most likely—he is generally the party who takes it—there is no secretary marked here but I should give it to the one who would call himself secretary although he has not signed u such—there is nothing in this entry to show me to which of the three the check was handed—the depositor s book after passing through the ledger comes to me as having to give the check MS BALLANTINE Q Is it usual for the secretary to sign the last of the three names A Yes—I do not know whether it is usual to describe his office—I merely take the names—the actuary and a clerk are generally present to direct the parties applying how to sign their names COURT Q But have you any recollection of this transaction A Not in particular—I take my turn as one of the managers to attend—I thirik the trustees for the time being and the secretary must be the parties to withdraw the money—I think the secretary must be one but the actuary can explain it better than I can—I acted on these three sig-natures and gave the check—what I require is the depositor s book in the first place to see that it corresponds with the number that I have in our Notice and Repayment-book —I do not myself particularly look at the minute-book—it appears to be the duty of the actuary or the clerk to have examined that previously to see that it is right Q I understood you to say you personally investigated all the particulars before you paid the money A Yes as far as the repayment went—as to whether these parties were authorized to receive it or not it was not my province—it was my province to pay when the proper documents were before me—the first document would be the depositor s book—that would show that notice was given for so much money to be withdrawn—it does not give the names of the parties who are to receive it—the minute-book would give me that—the minute-book must have been before me or I should not have paid the money—having the notice the minute-book and the depositor s book before me and seeing that the number corresponded I should give the check—I should not go to the actuary to ask him any question at all unless I was in any doubt about it—no one of these parties has signed as the secretary—I did not notice that at the time nor do I know exactly that it is necessary—I did not require the secretary to be there WILLIAM BAILEY I am a manager of the pay department in this Savings Bank On the 21st of Feb I paid this check for 30l —this is my entry of it—I have no minute of the manner in which it was paid—it would be most likely paid in gold but I cannot say WILLAM NATHANILE WORTLEY I am actuary of the Finsbury Sayings-bank George Selby is treasurer and a trustee—on the 1st of Jan 1844 the United Brothers had money deposited there—I find a notice in this book to withdraw 30l —I received that notice—it would be the duty of other parties to pay it—the depositor s book would be retained at the bank till the following week that the necessary entries preparatory to the repayment may be made—it is kept in my hands or my clerk s until the party send in their ticket which contains a number for the payment of that number—the secretary of the society is then called upon to produce the minute-hook that I may judge who are the right persons to receive the money—I remember nothing whatever about the payment of this parti-cular money—it is usual for the secretary to come when the money is paid and to sign at the foot of the receipt—the minute-book directs us who to pay—it contains the handwriting of the parties COURT Q Suppose it appeared that three of the members were to sign for the society and receive the money no one of whom was secretary would you require a fourth signature as that of the secretary A If he was present—it would require some very particular excuse to relieve him from attendance but the signatures of the trustees are the essential signa-tures—the signature of the secretary is usually taken for the purpose of identifying the trustees—our discharge is the signature of the persons to whom it is payable—the bona fide nature of the transaction and the appearance of the minute book would be the things we should judge by in that case—I do not know the prisoner—I never remember to have seen him—we have so many thousand depositors Cross-examined Q How long has the United Brothers Society banked with you A Since Feb 1834—I do not know any of the members—I look into the minute-book to see the names of the parties deputed to receive the money—it is invested in the names of the trustees for the time being and the minute-book shows us who are displaced and who supply their places and the genuine appearance of the book is the thing to guide us in the repayment COURT Q Then what check have you upon three persons who may come and represent themselves as the persons to receive A None what-ever except what we obtain from the minute-book—the signatures of the chairman and secretary in the minute-book are the only two signatures we look to—the secretary attends with the parties and says they are the gentlemen authorized to receive the money—they change their trustees every three months and sometimes every six weeks—the signature of the secre-tary in the minute-book would be compared with his signature when he signed at the foot of the receipt— looking at the book called the minute-book —there is no special minute entered in this book—here is a minute upon which a sum of 6l was paid in 1840—I have our book of 1840 here and here is an entry Ordered the sum of 6l by Messrs J Balls and J Coles trustees for the time being Witnessed W C Balls secretary —now J Balls and Coles never signed our book before till the secretary produced them and signed in our book—that was on the 21st of Oct 1840—he signed as the secretary there—that is a more correct minute—when the secretary attends he would sign either beneath or beside the others MR O BRIEN Q Separate altogether from those who receive the money A Yes—there is no entry as secretary in 1844—that was an accidental omission—our managers attend so seldom that they are not acquainted with the full necessities of the business MR BALLANTINE Q From what appears in that entry you cannot tell whether a secretary was present or not A Not merely by looking at that entry—there might be circumstances on very rare occasions when the money would be paid although no secretary was present—we have no previous entry relating to this society JAMES ANDREWS I am a member of the United Brothers Society In Jan 1844 I was steward to the society—I held a key of the chest—I saw the bank or depositor s book on the club evening Jan 1 1844—I have never seen it since—it used to be kept in the box before that time—I saw it that evening and examined it—it was out on the table—it wai not replaced in the box that evenig—it was left out to go to the bank next day—it was neglected or forgotten afterwards—it is only required once a year—the prisoner was our secretary—I know his handwriting—I believe the name of Willan Jones to this receipt to be the prisoner s handwriting—I have been in the habit of seeing him write very frequently for nearly six years Cross-examined Q I suppose he used to send out a number of circu-lars to the members A Yes—the depositor s book was in the box on the 1st of Jan before it was called for—one of the stewards brought it out—I was steward from Jan to March with Randall—we each had a key of the box and the landlord also—I did not examine the box from the 1st of Jan up to the time my stewardship ceased—I believe there were about three books in the box a long book and two others—neither of the minute-books were there—I had not occasion to go to the bank during my stewardship—the secretary always took the bank book from the steward at the time it was required and ought to return it to him on the following Friday night—it is taken from the box by the stewards and the landlord—the steward ought to have it returned to him and to lock it up COURT Q Have you any recollection who had possession of it on the night of the 1st of Jan 1844 A The prisoner—I recollect that—it was his duty to have it then to take to the bank—it was the steward s duty to go with him—they were authorized to go together—Randall did go with him HUME GRADDON I have been a member of the United Brothers five years—I have seen the prisoner write—I believe the signature of Willan Jones to this receipt to be his handwriting—I know the character of hw writing—he did not usually write so badly as that but I believe it to be his handwriting from the character of the W and the J in Jones Cross-examined Q When did you see that book A I cannot tell the date—it was one day at Clerkenwell police-court—Mr Duncombe the solicitor took me to see it—my attention was not directed to that name immediately—I am not a particularly good judge of handwriting—that is the general character of the prisoner s handwriting—I never saw him make a W otherwise— looking at the minute-book I see the W Jones in this hook—I should consider that in the prisoner s usual writing—this William Figgins I believe to be his—it is very seldom he wrote in that way—here is William Hall and William Figgins —the W s there are not written in the same way—the W in this book is his general way of writing—the W s in these two names was an occasional mode of writing—he might have written so for a particular purpose MR BALLANTINE Q Were you present at a general meeting of the society on the 9th of Jan A Yes I saw the prisoner write down the names of the persons who were present—I saw him write this page SAMUEL PEELING I am landlord of the City of London public-house and was so in Jan 1844—I know the prisoner and know his handwriting—I believe the Willan Jones to this receipt to be his handwriting but I speak more particularly to the Wi—that is remarkable—from what I have seen him write I consider that to be his style of writing—he was in the habit of writing such a W J RANDALL re-examined Looking at the committee-book This entry of the 5th of Feb 1844 J Randall deposited the bank-book in chest is not true—I read the same in another book—I cannot say when I last saw this book—it has been in the hands of our solicitor—I have no doubt I saw it previous to Jan 1844 but I did not know what it was—we were not aware of its being the minute-book—it is not the book that went to the bank when I went—the entries are in the prisoner s handwriting—it is not true that the bank-book was ever restored to me nor was I aware of any such entry till the 2nd of June after the book was lost JOHN MATTHEWS I am a member of the United Brothers—I was present at a meeting on the 2nd of June last—the prisoner was also present—our club closes at ten o clock—he went away about ten o clock—after he was gone the box was opened and a search made for the bank-book—it was not found—I went after the prisoner and found him at the Three Kings about half-past ten o clock—I said Mr Balls have you got the bank-book —he said I do not know that I have I will look and see when I get home and if I have I will meet you next day at one o clock at the club-house —I met him next day and he said he had looked among his papers and could not find it—the same day I and some other members went to the savings-bank and then ascer-tained that the money bad been taken out—I did not see the prisoner after that—when I saw him on the 3rd of June he said he had left his books at the Three Kings that he bad bad on the previous night and he would go there and look—I went with him—he looked over his books and said it was not there and I then left him—he did look over some books and papers—the landlord brought them into the parlour to him Cross-examined Q Who was present when the box was examined on the 2nd of June A I cannot say how many members there were—we found two or three books—I cannot say whether we found this committee-book—I do not know the books much—I believe it was there—the stewards opened the chest—I cannot exactly say who the stewards were at that time—the landlord was there—I never heard the prisoner say I know nothing of the bank-book since I gave it to Randall in 1844 —I did not have a long conversation with him at the Three Kings nor next day—I saw him at our next meeting on the 9th and saw him take down the proceedings MR BALLANTINE Q Did you look over the minute when he had made it A No—I cannot tell whether he wrote in the minute-book or not—I believe it was in that book he wrote the commitlee-book THOMAS SILVESTER I was a member of the United Brothers—I believe this signature of Willan Jones to be the prisoner s handwriting—I have often seen him write and have become acquainted with his style—I have seen his writing in our books—that is the reason why I judge of this and seeing him write likewise—I believe it to be his writing—at a meeting on the 6th of Jan 1845 I suggested that our bank-book should be taken to the bank to have our last year s interest added to the stock—the moment this suggestion was made the prisoner raised an objection he said he thought he could not keep the books open for it was past club hours—it was just upon ten o clock—I made the same suggestion on the 3rd of Feb the next club night—he then said we had better postpone it for another night for he wanted to go and meet a party of about forty gentlemen at a raffle—that was between nine and ten o clock during club hours—there was time for the resolution to be passed at that time but it was put off at his instance—I had not seen the depositor s book since the 1st of Jan 1844 Cross-examined Q Were you ever a steward of the Society A Yes prior to 1841 and in Nov and Dec last year—the prisoner was paid by the quarter 4d from each member—there are about twenty members—I do not know where the raffle was to be held—I did not go with him—I saw him the next night of meeting the 30th of March—he remained from eight till ten o clock as usual MR BALLANTINE Q Were your books exhibited that night A No—I asked the question that night when we were to have our bank interest added to the stock and he said we had better put it off till the quarterly night which was the next club night COURT Q Did you meet him the next quarterly night A Yes on the 5th of April—I went into the room a few minutes before ten o clock as they were calling over the roll for stewards which is generally the last thing done—as soon as it was called over I asked the prisoner whether there was anything going to be done abont the society s fund—he said it was getting past the time and it was too late to go into any other business that evening—he closed the books directly and went away—the next meeting was on the 5th of May—I was there and the prisoner also—I said nothing to him about the interest that evening—there was nothing done while I was present—I attended on the 2nd of June—I did not go into the room till five minutes before ten o clock and said nothing then—they were making up the books prior to closing—I heard him say he was going to a supper at the Three Kings in Clerkenwell-close and he begged we would excuse him for the rest of the evening which we did and he got up and went away in his usual hurried manner—I paid my contribution that evening—he saw me before he talked about going to the supper at the Three Kings—I was present when the box was searched and found the bank-book was not there—I was there on the 9th—nothing passed about the interest then—that meeting was in consequence of a general summons issued to get the prisoner to bring the bank-book and other books as he had got the books and we could not get at them—he appeared with these books and that is how we got them the bank minute-book the monthly meeting-book and several others—I call this the minute-book the commitlee-book —these are sick-books—he produced several of these books—I examined the bank minute-book that evening—this is the book that used to be sent to the bank—this is what we considered the bank minute-book—this other is a minute-book of our general meetings when we have anything particular—I am not aware that there was a sort of pass-book in which the monies received by the bank on our account were entered WILLIAM JONES I am a member of the United Brothers and have been sc thirteen or fourteen years—during that time there has been no other William Jones—the signature Willan Jones to this receipt is not my handwriting—I have not been to any meeting these four years Cross-examined Q Have you not ceased to be a member A No—I left the society about twelve months ago for a time and joined it again STEPHEN THORNTON police-constable A 26 I took the prisoner into custody on the 26th of June—a brother officer with me told him he was charged with obtaining 52l odd from the bank—he said be knew nothing about it be thought there was some underhand work the last meeting night and he had been very uncomfortable ever since—he said he should have been as anxious if they had spoken to him about the book to have found it as they were Cross-examined Q Where did you find him A At his lodgings on Thursday night the 26th of June MR O BRIEN called Alfred Punchard tailor No 11 Short s-buildings Clerkenwell-close Thomas Betts ivory-turner No 18 Ironmonger-row St Luke s John Hawkins ivory-turner No 12 Wenlock-terrace City-road and Benjamin Shillingford greengrocer No 1 Lower Smith-street Northampton-square deposed to the prisoner s good character but being examined by the Court stated they were not acquainted with his handwriting GEORGE SPEAR I am a tooth-brush maker and live at No 3 White-street Waterloo-town Bethnal-green I have known the prisoner eight or ten years—he has borne the character of an honest respectable man COURT Q Do you know anything of his handwriting A I have seen his handwriting several times—he has written to me— looking at the signature William Jones to the receipt —I do not know any character in this representing his handwriting—I do not believe it to be his handwriting— looking at the committee-book —this looks more like his than the other—it differs from what I have seen in his handwriting—I would rather say it was not his than that it was— looking at the bank minute-book —this looks a similar hand—I cannot say that either of them are his hand—writing—I have not noticed his handwriting sufficient to say that they are—I cannot say they are not but I do not think they are— again looking at the receipt —I do not see anything in this—I should say the others are more like his handwriting than this—I do not see anything to represent his handwriting here—his handwriting appeared more clear and smaller—I never noticed his W s or J s—I cannot recollect his handwriting being like this—this the committee-book appears more like it—I cannot say whether I believe it is his—this the minute-book appears to be the same hand—they seem to represent his hand more than the others—I cannot say that they are his handwriting GUILTY—Strongly recommended to mercy by the Jury Transported for Ten Years There was another indictment against the prisoner and MR BALLANTINE stared that he had obtained the whole fund belonging to the society 
t18450915-1802  1802 HENRY SHEEN alias Catmur was indicted for feloniously forging and uttering a request for the delivery of 2 reams of paper with intent to defraud Richard Knight and another MR DOANE conducted the Prosecution ALFRED KNIGHT I am the father of Richard and Alfred Knight who carry on business as stationers in Budge-row Watling-street—I resigned the business to them a few years ago—I occasionally go to assist them—I was there on the 23rd of May and saw the prisoner there—he handed to me this order— read— Sir I am very much disappointed at your not sending me my order and hoping that you will by bearer the small hand two reams of double crown to weigh 2lbs each and when you send me the boards send in the bill and I will pay for them and I have sent a little account by the bearer Please send in the boards as soon as possible as I am in want of them for work that must go in directly as it is a country order I am sir for H Catmur No 8 Hollybush-row Bethnal-green-road —when I read it I asked him who Mr Catmur was—he said Mr Catmur was a very respectable man—I said Why does he apply to us Who has he been accustomed to have his paper of or where does he have his paper —he mentioned Messrs Morgan and others—I said Who does he work for —he mentioned Mr Tegg the extensive bookseller in Cheapside and some other persons—he represented Mr Catmur as a bookbinder—I asked why he did not continue to buy the paper where they had been accustomed particularly Messrs Morgan who I thought would supply them with verything they wanted—he said Mr Catmur had been so much disappointed that he was losing his customers for want of getting his goods in proper time—I asked how long he had been in the service of Mr Catmur—he said not a great while not many months—upon this I gave orders for him to have the paper—I saw it delivered to him and a boy who was with him at the time assisting him—eight reams were delivered to him worth 2l 3s —I never got the money for it—I made inquiries afterwards and he was taken into custody Prisoner The first order I gave was sent to my own house in Holly-bush-lane and I called next morning and paid for it he is mistaken about my representing myself as working for Mr Catmur Witness I am sure he did so—he did pay for the first order—it was done as a decoy HENRY CATMUR I am the prisoner s father I live at No 164 Bethnal-green-road and have done so fifty years—I never lived in Hollybush-row—this request is not in my handwriting neither the name nor the body of it—I never authorized anybody to write it for me—I do not know whose handwriting it is—I have an opinion that it is like the writing of my unfortunate son—I cannot deny it—I have seen him write frequently—I think it is his handwriting—I never authorized him to write it—I did not get the paper and never heard anything about it till after this transaction—I am a bookbinder—I work for Mr Tegg—I have bought paper of Messrs Morgan—they very seldom disappointed me nothing worthy of remark—I have not changed in consequence—the prisoner has frequently been in my employment but only occasionally up to last Jan —he was not in my employment in May last—he had left me—I knew he was gone to Holly bush-gardens or row—I knew he was carrying on business there but I have never been to the house MR KNIGHT re-examined The prisoner represented that the paper was for Mr Catmur—he did not say for his father—he represented himself as the workman of Mr Catmur who had worked for Mr Tegg about fifteen years and the prisoner being a young man of course we did not consider him as that person—he brought the order as from Mr Catmur and said Mr Catmur had desired him to refer to Mr Tegg and Messrs Morgan—I afterwards learnt from Mr Tegg that Mr Catmur had another workshop away from his place of residence—that did not influence us with respect to this order—it did afterwards—we did not apply to Mr Tegg on the first occasion Prisoner That order was a request sent by my boy he is not here Witness I think there was a lad with him but I am not quite certain as to that time—he came into the counting-house and I then had the conversation with him which I have related—we made no inquiry at that time—he gave me the account before he had the goods—I did not supply him on the prior occasion—it was a small lot sent down on the preceding day to his place in Bethnal-green-road somewhere—he called to pay for that and said Mr Cutmur wished these goods to be delivered as they were wanted for immediate use—the prisoner did not say who was the writer of this paper—he said Mr Catmur was his employer and that he had worked for him two months—I suppose he brought the note sealed—there is sealing-wax on it—it must have come sealed—I opened the note—he brought it as though from another person and when he presented it to me he brought 1l 10s and told me Mr Catmur had sent it for some goods which had been left at the house the day before—I asked him as the workman of Mr Catmur who Mr Catmur was—he quite gave me to understand he was describing the person whose signature was to this note—I let him have the goods believing they were for the person he was describing—he got the goods by the representations of who sent him and who the person was—I believed I was supplying the goods to the person he described Mr Catmur GUILTY Aged 22 — Transported for Seven Years There were two other indictments against the prisoner who has been previously convicted of robbing his father

t18450915-1816  1816 CHARLES LAUNDER was indicted for feloniously forging a certain deed with intent to defraud Thomas Hagger and others —Other Counts varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS CLARKSON and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution GEORGE NEWTON BROWN I am secretary to the South Midland and Northampton Railway Company—the office of that company is at No 1 Gray s-inn-square—I saw this letter marked A in our office—I do not remember receiving it—this letter marked B is a letter of allotment Letter A being read teas an application for fifty shares in the South Midland Railway Company dated 9th June 1845 and signed Ferdinand de Lisle Devonshire-square merchant and Russell-house Balham-hill referring to Messrs Hankey witness Charles Launder land-surveyor 7 Great Charlotte-street Blackfriars-road Letter B was dated 5th July 1845 directed to Ferdinand de Lisle Esq Russell-house Balham-hill allotting him twenty-five shares and stating that a deposit of 27l 10s must be paid before the 15th instant and the banker s receipt attached MR BROWN The banker s receipt was not filled up when I sent the letter—the party obtaining the letter upon the deposit being paid would be entitled to the shares and would obtain scrip receipts—those receipts are saleable in the market—the prisoner came to our office—I am not quite certain as to the day—he produced this letter marked B —the receipt was filled up at that time—the subscribers agreement was produced to him—this is it—I saw him sign this deed— reading— Ferdinand De Lisle merchant Russell-house Balham-hill —Thomas James Tatham and William Young are the trustees—Thomas Hagger is a director and one of the provisional committee—there are others Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Have you been the secretary from the formation of the scheme A I have been secretary since the 23rd of May this year—that was shortly after the project was started—we have not got an act of Parliament at present—we have not applied to Parliament—the Parliamentary contract is signed by a great many persons—no person can obtain scrip unless the deposit money has been paid—I was present when the defendant came to the office—the deposit money 27l 10s was paid—I was not examined at the police-court—if we do not get an act of Parliament the persons obtaining the allotments would lose a portion the deposit money—I cannot say what has been paid—we have issued prospectuses and advertisements—there are four or five schemes in the field against us—if we are defeated in our application to Parliament the letters of allotment will probably be worthless MR BALLANTINE Q About this time were the shares at a premium A Yes at the time the deed was signed—a person having a scrip paper of this description would no doubt be able to get rid of it at once in the market COURT Q At a premium beyond the amount of the deposit A Yes about 2l at that time—the person selling them would get 50l beyond the 2l 10s MR PARRY Q Do you call the scrip a person obtains a certificate of the share A Yes of the deposit having been paid and when the Act is obtained the person has the shares HENRY STANLEY I am the attesting witness to this subscription of a person to this deed by the name of Ferdinand De Lisle—the prisoner is the person—it is sealed—he came to the office on the 17th of July—I asked him if his name was Ferdinand De Lisle—he said it was—he produced the letter of allotment—I laid the deed before him to be executed and he wrote Ferdinand De Lisle —I have entered under the different heads the words merchant and place of abode Russell House Balham-hill —I got that from himself—he then signed his name—then follows the amount of subscription the number of shares twenty-five and the amount paid 27l 10s —he put his finger on the seal and delivered it as his act and deed—he said he was brother to De Lisle and Co Devonshire-square bankers—the secretary then delivered to him the scrip fur twenty-five shares Cross-examined Q How long have you been connected with railway schemes A The last two years I have been connected with this company since last Jan —it was started about May or June—I am a clerk in the office of Mr Stanley—as applications for shares come in we enter them in a book—a list is made out and placed before the directors—I do not know whether any inquiry was made with reference to this application—I cannot say what inquiries were made—if we do not know the party we should make inquiry—I presume the party signing is the party applying and on that presumption we allot the shares MR CLARKSON Q When you came into the establishment about June had all the shares been allotted A No applications were going on MR BROWN re-examined I believe no inquiry was made at Hankey s De Lisle s or at Russell House after the application was received—the firm of De Lisle and Co were known JAMES SHAW I and my wife take care of Russell House Balham-hill for a gentleman named Wood the landlord—I have known the prisoner about fifteen years—he was in partnership with my sister s husband some time ago—I had not seen him for about ten years till he came to Russell House to see me oh a Sunday evening at the latter end of April or the beginning of May this year—he came into the garden and asked me if there was any name or title to the house—I said it was called Russell House—after a very short time he left—three or four days afterwards my wife received a letter—I never took in any letters myself nor did my wife hand any over to me—she read them to me—I cannot say whether this letter B was one that she read over to me—my wife kept them as far as I know—after some of the letters had come the prisoner came—he said Why good God you almost frightened me to death by sending me such a letter as you did refusing to take in letters —I had written in the envelope that if any more letters came I should return them— Walter Reid Hooper proved the service of a notice on the prisoner to produce all letters and naming this one —I wrote in the envelope that if any more letters came directed to Ferdinand De Lisle I should send them back to the writers—it was that brought him down to my house—I said to him I am not in my own castle and therefore do not like taking in any letters as the landlord might be angry with me for receiving any letters not my own —he said there was no harm in it—he put his hand on my shoulder and said My good fellow do you think I would do you any harm or any one else I never did you any harm nor ever will —he talked me over saying he would do no harm and he was only trying to get in as clerk or something to a business in a railroad—I said I did not like the idea of taking in letters in any other name—he left after that—there were several letters taken in after that by my wife Cross-examined Q Do you know whether all the letters and documents belonging to him have been seized by the police A I have been told so—a letter was destroyed by my children MR BALLANTINE Q Was that a letter received by your wife A It was read to me by my wife—I do not recollect her reading but one SARAH SHAW I am the wife of the last witness I recollect the prisoner coming one Sunday evening to see my husband—I let him in and sent him to my husband—three or four days after that I took in a letter which I read to my husband—it was destroyed by my children Cross-examined Q Are you sure that was the one destroyed by your children A Yes I gave it to them and saw them destroy it MR CLARKSON Q What was in it A My dear fellow since I last saw you there has been several contracts of railways out and by taking in some letters addressed to Ferdinand De Lisle Esq Russell House Balham-hill you will do me a great deal of good as I was once employed by that gentleman and the clerks will answer his letter when they might not answer mine —it was signed Charles Launder —in that letter was an envelope enclosed to forward any letter addressed to Ferdinand De Lisle Esq to Charles Launder No 2 Webber-street Blackfriars-road two wafers a Queen s head and a small slip of paper requested to be sent to the Post-office for them to deliver all such letters addressed thus—my husband received that envelope from me—I saw him write something in it—a letter came three or four days afterwards addressed to Ferdinand De Lisle—I enclosed that in an envelope after my husband had written in it and sent it to the post—the prisoner came two or three days afterwards—I afterwards received other letters directed to the same address—I enclosed them and still forwarded them Cross-examined Q Have you known the prisoner lately A I never saw him till then FREDERICK STAUVA I live at No 1 Gray s-inn-square and am secretary to the Isle of Jersey Railway Company I am acquainted with the family of Ferdinand de Lisle—I was introduced to the prisoner by Mr Fearon—he brought him into my office and introduced him as being Mr Ferdinand de Lisle—the prisoner addressed me directly by the name of Ferdinand—I said My name is not Ferdinand —he said Frederick —I said Yes I believe you are Mr Ferdinand de Lisle —he said Yes —that was all that passed—he then went into the other room to sign the deed Cross-examined Q Are you a solicitor A No—the South Midland the Cheltenham and Isle of Jersey railways have their offices at No 1 Gray s-inn-square—there are others—I do not know their names—it is a sort of railway depot FERDINAND DE LISLE ESQ I am a general merchant and banker and live at No 16 Devonshire-square I do not know the prisoner—the signature to

Blackfriars-road Mr Stauva was in my company—he was asked by Mr Stauva if his name was Launder—he said it was—I asked him if he knew Mr Ferdinand De Lisle—he said yes—I asked if he had signed Mr De Lisle s name to any railway deed—he said he had—when I was searching his apartment he said if he had signed the deed he had no idea he was doing wrong because he knew so many others who bad done similar things—I found a pocket-book on him and a great quantity of letters A certificate of the railway being provisionally registered was put in and read GUILTY Aged 51 —Recommended to mercy

him to Mrs Naylor s house and arranged for him to lodge there—I think he was to pay 9s a week—I saw him there on the Sunday following the 31st of Aug —he spoke broken English—I managed to understand him with great difficulty—he said he wanted a frame or some paper made about 2000 sheets and asked me to get it for him and gave me a pattern for the colour—it was red—it was like this— looking at part of a genuine Norwegian note marked No 1 —he at the same time showed me the piece of white paper produced No 15 —he wanted me to get this sort of paper with the word Lottery on it—it was to be this colour and these marks—I understood him it was to be a frame formed to produce this water-mark—the water-mark was to be like this but it was to be the colour of the other paper—I cannot swear this is the very paper he showed me but it is like it—it is a drawing of the water-mark lines not having a water-mark on it—I will not swear it is the identical paper but it closely resembles it—when he gave mo the order about it I did not exactly understand him and asked whether all these lines were to be in the water-mark as was in the paper—he said it was to be very exact—I pointed to the wordsin German text and he said Exactly —I did not understand the words—they are Norges Bank —he said that was his name—there is the word Lottery here—it is high up and might be cut off if necessary leaving Norges Bank in this little square—I was to get the paper if I could—I took the drawing of the water-mark and the coloured paper to assist me in inquiring about it—at the time I had this conversation with hitn there were drawing materials on his table and several papers—this was at No 34 Gloucester-street—I noticed a piece of coloured paper like this No 16 on the table—I went to the house again on Thursday the 4th of Sept at his residence in Gloucester-street and told him I had not got any information about his paper and the only place I thought he was likely to get it would be at the head manufacturer s or at paper-mill—I appointed to go that afternoon with him to a person whom I dealt with for paper—I returned to him the two pieces of paper I had received from him—I called on him again at three o clock by appointment and took him to Mr Ordish—he did not succeed in getting the paper there—I saw Bull again at his lodgings a few days after—he had called on me and requested me to call on him—he told me he had found out a place in the City where he could get the paper and that he had ordered it—he wanted me to fetch it for him when it was done—it was to be done in nine days—he said it was to be a good bit of money—I asked him how much and from what I could make out it was 9l and 10l and 9s which I understood to be 19l 9s —I called again in about nine days—he was not at home—I called two or three times I taw him at last at the same lodging—he told me he had got the paper—he said he might want me for something else but I saw no more of him Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q What situation does Mr Rentoul bold in the Mint A He is one of the moneyers—I am a workman there—I have been there four years—I was not present at any examination before the Magistrate—I think

showed me Norges Bank on the note and said that was his name—how was I not to know it was his name in foreign language—I knew his name was Bull then—he did not tell roe the name of the paper-maker in

our company besides Bull—I did not know him—I should say he was a foreigner—they were talking in a foreign language—I did not hear hit name mentioned—if he did mention his name it was in a foreign language—I should not know the name if it was repeated to me—they talked entirely in a foreign language and I was some distance between them—I never saw that gentleman again only Bull—that gentleman went into the lodging and saw Mrs Naylor—I thought they were talking about the lodging when they went to Mrs Naylor s ROBERT BENTOUL I hold a situation in the Mint I was at Stockholm last Aug —I left there on Thursday the 14th of Aug for Lubeck by a steam boat—the prisoner Bull was a passenger on board—I had some conversation with him not much—we talked about painting generally—he said he was going to London to paint a large picture for some gentleman there—he said he had painted a picture for king Oscar—we arrived at Lubeck on Sunday the 17th—I stopped at Lubeck six or seven hours and then went on to Hamburgh where I arrived the same night—I saw Bull at Hamburgh several times—I observed that he had about him some English money and a Norwegian note—the colour of the note was pink—I believe the pink colour ia confined to notes of certain value—in consequence of something that passed between me and a gentleman I asked Bull if he would like to change his Norwegian money for English money knowing this gentleman who waa going to Norway would change with him—he said no he would keep it till it returned to his own country—I do not know whether he had only one note—it appeared a small pile—I only saw it in his pocket-book—we left Hamburgh for London by the John Bull steamer on the Tuesday—Bull was a passenger—we had some conversation on the way on different subject—we talked

particular water-mark—he asked me if I could recommend him to an hotel—we had a very stormy passage indeed—we were obliged to put back to Cuxhaven once—it was at night and I only know of once—I saw Bull at hi lodging in Gloucester-street after he came to London—he asked me abotf getting paper made if I could tell him where to get it—I had sent the witness Smith to him—he said he had seen Smith

was connected with the Mint nor anything connected with it—I did not say what I was—I afterwards gave him my address in London—I am engaged every day at the Mint—I have apartments there bat I do not live there—I gave him my address in Wellington-street Strand—I think I never mentioned that I was in any way connected with the Mint unless it might have been on my card—it might have been so—I believe Royal Mint was on the card as well as Wellington-street SARAH NAYLOR I am a widow and live at No 34 Gloucester-street Queen-square—I let apartments there furnished I know the witness Smith—on Wednesday the 27th of Aug last he came to my bouse with the prisoner Bull—there was no one else with them to my recollection—I learned from Mr Smith that Bull wanted an apartment—he took my lower room

came—he slept there that night—there was nobody else with him on the Thursday to my recollection—there was nobody else that had anything to do with my lodging—he occupied my parlour for two or three weeks to the best of my recollection—it wai one room with a sofa bed in it—he then took the upper apartment—about a week after he came or it might have been a few days after he spoke of I friend he expected from abroad—he said very little respecting it at that time further than if he came could I accommodate him with apartments in my bouse—I told him I could not then give him an answer but I probably might be able to do so—I was full at the time—I afterwards showed bin another apartment—he spoke to me again about his friend not above once of twice—I showed him the other apartment it might have been about the 9th of Oct —I cannot call to my memory as to the time—I believe the prisondrt were taken into custody on the 4th of Oct —I think it was about a fortnigty before that that Bull spoke to me about the upper room—I showed bin the room and he consented to take it at 6s per week while alone—tbai was a room in which two persons could be accommodated—I arranged W two bed places to his satisfaction—I never saw him engaged in any drawing during the lime he was in my lower room nor with pencils—he did not keep the lower room still—that was given up—the prisoner Smith was there but two days before he was taken into custody—I remember Mr Rentoul calling on Bull once or twice—Bull named to me one morning when he rang his bell that the witness Smith had not attended on him at his desire to go about some paper—I knew Smith before—Bull asked me when I went out if I would make inquiry where I could get him the paper which he had engaged Smith to get for him as he did not come to hint and he seemed to be very fidgetty about the paper—I said I would endeavour to do so—he told me what sort of paper he wanted and gave me a piece of paper to take with me—it was such a piece as this— looking at one —it was to be pink—he produced a piece of this colour—I think he produced a piece of pink paper on another piece of paper—I believe it was not fixed on the paper—I took it down to Mr Newell and produced it to him—it was like this— No 15 knowing the house of Smith of Long-acre to be respectable I went there to make inquiry—they referred me to Saunders of Cloak-lane and Wilson of St Martin s-court—Bull went with me to St Martin t-court and to Smith s of Long-acre—as we went along to Saunders we saw an iron-wire worker s named Cato on Holborn-hill—before I went to Saundens I returned and gave the prisoner the card of Wilson of St Martin s-court—Smith referred me to Wilson s and Wilson referred me to Cloak-lane—that was the same day I went to Wilson s—I returned to Bull and he went with me—when we got to Wilson s Bull produced this pattern for the water-mark which I have just seen No 15 and the piece of red paper—after putting this into the hands of the gentleman in the shop who went back to consult his employer he returned it to Bull and said they did not make such things but gave us a reference to Saunders and Co of Cloak-lane who he said had paper-mills—we then went home and After dinner by Bull s request I accompanied him to Saunders —on our way we called at Cato s—Bull produced the paper for the water-mark to Cato s man but he did not seem to understand what Bull said—he said he could not do what was wanted—when we got to Saunders we saw a gentleman—Bull produced the piece of pink paper to him and also the other and said he wanted a paper manufactured in pink like that and with these lines showing this piece fdr the colour—I think the word water-mark was used—Bull asked what it would come to—the gentleman said he must call again he could not tell him what it would come to—we left the shop together—I did not go any more—Bull left the two papers with the gentleman—about the lattet end of Sept Bull said he expected his friend in England—he afterwards told me he had arrived—I think that was two or three days before the prisoner Smith came—he said he had come from abroad he did not say where from and he would be at my lodging in a day or two—I believe Smith called at my house one day before he came to sleep in my house but I was not at home at the time—he came on Thursday the 2nd of Oct and slept that night in the up-stairs room in the same room with Bull—he came about the middle of the day—Bull came with him—they came in a cab—Smith had ft portmanteau a carpet bag and a hat-box— looking at the things found hy Forrester at the lodging —this black portmanteau is Bull s and this it his carpet bag and blue hat-box—this other portmanteau carpet bag and leather hat-box are Smith s—soon after Smith s arrival I saw this green dressing-case—one morning after Smith came Bull came down stairs and asked me to dry a piece of pink paper by the fire—he brought it from his room—I believe I was in the kitchen when I was called—I went up stairs into the passage—three stairs lead from the passage towards the kitchen—Bull was on the first floor stairs when he called me but he came down to the ground floor and I met him at the foot of the stairs in the passage—I do not think the piece of paper was so large as the one produced—I think he waited in the passage while I went and dried it by the kitchen fire—I then returned it to him and he went up stairs—Smith was up stairs at the time to the best of my knowledge—he had not gone out to my knowledge—it might have been about ten o clock—their breakfast had been taken up to them—I saw Smith go out a few minutes after that with Bull about ten o clock—during the time they were with me they always went out and returned together Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Do not you know that when Bull came to your house with the witness Smith he had a foreign gentleman with him who came into your room A I have no recollection of it whatever—or of his having any conversation with him in a foreign language—I should be sorry to swear it—I have no recollection of a foreigner coming with Smith and Bull to take the lodging—I agreed for the lodging in the presence of Smith—I made the agreement—Bull talked to me about some paper shortly after coming to the lodging—he did not say he wanted it manufactured in a particular way—he said he wanted a paper for a lottery—the word Lottery was on the paper—he told me it was for a lottery—he went and showed the paper in 8t Martin Wourt and afterward in Cloak-lane—I was present all the time—no foreigner ever called on Bull after he took the lodging to my knowledge—my daughter chiefly answers the door—she is not here—I should have known if any persons had come—it is usual for my daughter to communicate to me who calls THOMAS NEWELL I am foreman to Messrs Saunders makers of bank-note paper in Cloak-lane On the 10th of Sept Bull came to our place accompaniedby Mrs Naylor—he showed me these papers Nos 2 and 15 and told me he wanted some paper made—he wanted this character in the water-mark but the paper to be this colour pink —he asked what it would cost—I said I could not then say he was to call next duy—he left the two papers with me—he came next day alone—I then told him the price 4l 10s for the mould and the price of the paper would depend a good deal on the quantity wanted—hethen gave me to understand that five reams of paper would be required—the mould was to be made of wire—all paper moulds are made of wire—he did not speak of that—I knew at once what was required at I am in the habit of making so much paper—five reams would supply 2 400 sheets 480 to the ream—the order was given in reams—I do not think anything was said about thenumber of sheets—the paper was to be 60s per ream—I told him so—he came next day and paid me 5l on account—he wished to have the paper in about fourteen days—I told him we would lose no time but would put it in hand immediately—we proceeded to make the paper in pursuance of his instructions—this was the first we manufactured No 14 —he came and looked at it—before he saw that he came and said there was an error in the water-mark of the pattern he had given me—the letter O is in the right hand corner of the original—he told me it ought to be C—he made this memorandum as he stoodby my side—directing me to make the 0 into C—we corrected the frame accordingly—he said the paper was useless to him but as it was his fault bewould pay the expense—we had made the v hole five reams—he also said the colour was not quite correct and the paper was too stout—there was another inaccuracy in the small C on the left hand—he brought me on a little piece of paper a C marked which it was to be a copy of—the upstroke of the small Cwas not fine enough there was to be a little stroke left out—he gave me a pattern for that—he came on Thursday the 2nd of Oct alone between twelve and one in the forenoon I believe—he then told me the paper was too thick—he had told me so on the previous day and on that day he renewed his orderfor 1 300 sheets after the alteration of the mould—it was on the 1st of Oct that he discovered about the 0 being wrong Q As you said it would take about a fortnight I suppose he staid away at fortnight A He might call to see if it was done—I will not be certain of that but he called on the 10th of Sept on the 11th 12th and again on the Ist of Oct when he came to speak about the O—on the 2nd he brought me this small piece of paper as a specimen No 21 and with it he brought this piece of pink paper No 20 —he said the small piece of pink paper was the colour and nubitance required and I was to take great care of that piece and return it to him—it was on the 2nd that he ordered the 1 300 sheets and he paid me 10l —he said he wished to have it as early as possible as he wished to send it abroad—we had the mould altered and made a sheet or two—this is one—I do not think he saw it after it was corrected—before the rest was done we heard that he was taken into custody Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Although you could understand him very imperfectly I think you say you knew what he wanted because you are so accustomed to make this special kind of paper A Yes—I told him the paper which had been first made was useless and most be paid for and—he said yes it was—I cannot swear that I said so to him—it is difficult to repeat the alterations made by Bull as I could not understand his words—I only infer it was understood to be useless to him—a communication was made by Mr Saunders to the parties now prosecuting—I do not know when—it was while it was in progress THOMAS HARRY SAUNDERS I am a paper-maker and live at No 8 Cloak-lane On the 1st of Oct I recollect Bull coming to my place of business—Newell was present—Bull pointed out the inaccuracy in the paper which was then made and was ready for delivery—I have been in the trade about eight years and am well acquainted with paper—I consider I understand the difference between the make of different makers—many writing-papers have the makers name on them—I cannot tell positively by seeing paper who it is made by WILLIAM THOROGOOD I live at Hackney I am in the shoe trade—on Thursday the 1st of Oct I happened to be in Cloak-lane City and saw the two prisoners come into Cloak-lane together—I was outside Mr Saunders s premises—I was acting under instructions from Forrester the officer—I saw them both come into Cloak-lane—they were in company with each other—they appeared to be looking about for some house when Bull went into No 8 which is Mr Saunders s—Smith stood outside—Bull was in Mr Saunders s about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—when he came out he joined in company with Smith and they walked away together into Walbrook—I continued to watch them—when about the middle of Walbrook Bull took from his pocket a piece of pink-coloured paper—he held it up and Smith looked through it—Bull held it up as if looking through it and Smith looked through it at the same time as Bull was holding it up—they then stood talking a minute or two—they then walked to the top of Walbrook—Bull then took from his pocket the piece of coloured paper again—they stopped again and Smith took it in his hand and they both looked through it again holding it to the light as before—they then walked into Cheapside got into an omnibus and went to No 21 Norfolk-street Strand—I got on the out-side of the omnibus and went with it Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You say you were watching the parties A Yes from instructions—I did not know Smith before—he had not been pointed out to me—it was the first time I had seen him—I ww him again when he was at the Mansion-house THOMAS NEWELL re-examined When Bull came on the 2nd of Oct I gave him half a sheet of pink paper which he took away with him JOSEPH BALL I am in the employ of Seare and Co engravers 44 High Holborn On the 15th Sept last I received an order from the prisoner Bull to make a block—he gave me a pattern from which I was to make it—the first time he gave it me in pencil—the second time he gave me this pattern No 16 —that was two or three days after be gave me the first—I did not attempt to make anything till he brought that—the second time he came was on the 15th—he did not care what it was made upon anything that would make an impression would do—I proposed to him that it should be made on copper—that is the ordinary way—I told him it would be the cheapest way—it would present a difficulty to anybody not acquainted with the printing trade to take an impression from it—I explained to him if it was done on copper it would be necessary to have a press but it would be about half the price—he said he wanted it so that he could press it down himself and it was agreed to be engraved on brass—I showed him a block of brass something similar to this and asked him if that was what he meant—it had an Oriental pattern on it—he said that would do very well—the price agreed on was 6l —I asked him 3l deposit—he threw down 1l —he said he wanted it directly—I told him he could not have it under three weeks—I gave him a receipt for the deposit on one of ray master s cards—this is it No 17 —I also wrote on this card the price for which the work was to be done 6l —when this pattern was put into my hand I was told to be very particular about the number of lines that were to be put—there were to be thirteen lines on the left-hand corner of the note that is the right-hand corner of the block—he brought this piece of paper with him No 18 and he wrote upon it his name and address in my presence—I did not exactly know whether he said thirteen or thirty lines—I got him to write it down and he wrote the figures 13 —I did not exactly understand the shading of the border in one particular part and he made a sketch of it on the paper to make me understand it—it was by means of the sketch that I was able to understand what the border was to be—he made that in my presence—I took particular notice of his writing when he wrote his name and address—I believe the address on this letter No 22 34 Gloucester-street Queen-square Blumsbrey to be his handwriting—he was to call in eight days to see how far we got on with the block—he waited ten days and then called—that was the 25th Sept —I showed him the state in which it was—on Tuesday the 30th Sept he called again to see the block—he was alone—I showed it him—it was then in a more forward state—he said he must go to Germany and pressed me to get on with it—I promised it in a day or two—he did not call again until the Friday the 3rd Oct between two and three in the afternoon—I showed him the block—he seemed to approve of it very much—while he was looking at it I saw him beckoning to a person at the door which person was looking in at the side window—I did not take particular notice of that person till Bull called him in—it was the prisoner Smith—he came and took the block in his band and looked at it—this is the block and it was in this state on that occasion—Bull put it into Smith s hands—they both together moved to the door each of them looked at it very minutely and Smith nodded his head as if he approved of it and spoke something in their language—Bull was showing it to him—I promised Bull he should have the block in two or three days Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Was anybody present when Bull came the first time about this matter A There was another shopman—nobody else—this is the pattern he presented No 16 —it was in this state that Bull presented it to me except where I have cut it out to work with—this is done in pencil—I told him that would not do and he produced the drawing in ink to make it more perfect—I handed it back to him for that purpose—I observe in holding this up to the light a line where the ink does not catch which cuts the letters in halves—I see a straight line across the letters—the plate is not finished—there could be such a line put—I had no instructions to put one—there is no such line in the copy given me—I do not know whether it is the fault in the printing or not—it might he caused by the impression not coming off perfect—I never saw Bull write except on that occasion—I should say this was similar to the name and address he wrote—I took particular notice MR CLARKSON Q From the attention you paid to the character and manner of his handwriting do you believe what you saw on the letter produced is the same handwriting A I do—there would not be the least difficulty in making the white horizontal line which cuts through the letters on the note—the least thing would do it—a mere scratch through the middle of the letters would do it FREDERICK JOHN WHITEMAN I am an engraver and live at No 19 Little Queen-street Holborn I know Bull—he gave me an order for some engraving in Sept last—he called on me again I think on the 2nd of Oct last some time in the morning—it was Thursday—he was alone—he wished me to make three stamps upon brass—he brought me these three papers Nos 3 4 and 5 as a pattern of what he wanted—I was to make three brass blocks to produce impressions like that—he left 1l with me—in consequence of suspicions I had I thought it right to communicate with the Norwegian consul Mr Tottie—Bull had employed me to do some engraving besides these and on the Tuesday evening previous I gave him something which I had engraved for him—he came to me first on the 27th of Sept and employed me to engrave something and on Tuesday the 30th of Sept I gave him the plate I had engraved wrapped in this piece of brown paper— produced by Forrester —it was a similar paper to this—I will not say it is the same Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Are you able to swear to that paper A I can only say it has every appearance of the same paper—there appears to be the mark of the plate—it—was either this or a piece exactly like it—I could tell better if I had the plate— putting the plate in it —I believe it is the piece—I judge from the plate—it was carelessly folded in the paper—there was also a packet which he said contained paints which I believe I folded up in the paper—it was a packet containing among other things a facsimile of the plate I had to make—the original which I had to copy from—this is it— No 1 and this No 6 is an impression from the plate—this No 7 is the approved one—one of them had been given him before and one I enclosed with the copper-plate—I do not think I gave him more than one—there was a package with the plate which was much thicker than the plate but I could not say it was larger—it was about the same size HENRY RAMSAY TOTTIE I am the younger son of the Norwegian consul I was at Stockholm on the 18th of Sept going to Travemunde by the steam-packet Sweathart which is one of the ancient names of Sweden—the prisoner Smith was one of the passengers—we arrived at Travemunde on Monday the 22nd at three o clock in the morning—we started on Thursday at twelve and were all Friday and Saturday—I went direct from there to Hamburgh—I saw Smith at Hamburgh on the following day Tuesday the 23rd—I addressed a few words to him—I asked how he travelled from Travemunde to Hamburgh—he said he came by the Diligence—he did not tell me where he was going to—I should say he knew I was the son of the Norwegian consul—he addressed me as Mr Tottie but whether he knew I was the son of the consul I cannot tell LOUIS CORNU I am servant at No 21 Norfolk-street Strand which is a lodging-house kept by Mr Culverwell On the 29th of Sept the prisoner Smith came there with a Mr Melsham from whom I understood he had just arrived in England—I knew Mr Melsham before—I believe he comes from Copenhagen—they arrived at the house between ten and eleven o clock at night—their luggage came in with them—on the following morning the 30th I took breakfast up to Smith in his bed-room—when he came down stairs he asked for a commissioner—I asked him what he wanted—he showed me a letter with an address on it—I told him the best plan was for him to take a cab—he wanted to go to the place mentioned in the letter— looking at a letter marked No 22 —I think this was the same direction he showed me I am almost sure—it was the same kind of paper—he took it out of bit pocket-book—he told me to send for a cab and I got him one—the direction on this letter is No 34 Gloucester-street Qveen-square Blumsbrey —I could not swear that was the direction he showed me but I believe it to be the same letter—what brought it to my mind was seeing it in the newspaper two or three days after—I told the cabman to drive him to No 34 Gloucester-street Queen-square Bloomsbury because Smith showed me that in the letter—I am sure I told the cabman to drive to that place—Smith returned the same day—a gentleman visited him that day and dined with him—I believe the prisoner Bull to be the person in fact I am sure—he came back with him and they dined together—I believe Bull saw him once or twice more while he was at our house—he came the next day again—Smith staid three days at our house—he came on the Monday and went away on the Thursday—Bull saw him every day—Bull asked me for Smith s bill on leaving—I made it out—I believe Smith paid it—they were both there—they both went away together in a cab taking Smith s luggage with them Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Do you keep a book in which you enter the names of parties coming to and leaving your house A Yes—I referred to that book to ascertain the facts in reference to Smith—I found an entry when he arrived and when he left—I have not got that book here—I gave the cabman the address I saw on the letter—I will undertake to swear I told the cabman to go to No 34 Gloucester-street Queen-square DANIEL FORRESTER I am an officer In consequence of information and instructions I received I went on the 4th of Oct last with my brother to the house of Mr Whiteman of Little Queen-street Lincoln s Inn-fields—we went into the back parlour by the private door—after we had been there a little time I heard an intimation given in consequence of which I looked round and saw the prisoner Bull in the shop—on that I went out at the private door into the street leaving my brother in the back parlour—when I got into the street I saw Smith looking in at a print-shop window in Little Queen-street within a door or two of Mr Whiteman s on the same side of the way—I saw Bull come out of Mr Whiteman s shop—he joined Smith and they crossed the road together into Great Queen-street leading into Lincoln s Inn-fields—I followed them—they appeared to hesitate which way they should go—Bull appeared to me to take something from his bosom—I crossed over close to him and he had a parcel in his hand—I said to him You have a copper-plate I want —at the same time I saw Smith have a piece of brown paper in his hand—I caught hold of the plate in Bull s right hand—he resisted and in getting the plate from him I cut my hand with the plate—this the copper-plate I took from him—Bull also had these two pieces of paper in his hand— Nos 1 and 7 —I have produced the piece of brown paper—I can scarcely tell whether I took it from the hand of Smith for I thought Smith had the plate at the moment—I caught hold of the paper and let it go—this is the paper—it was given to me at the Mansion House—it is like it in every respect—I searched Bull at the Mansion-house—I found a pocket-book on him which contained these four pieces of paper marked 8 9 10 and 11 —one has Norgea Hank in capital letters another Norges Bank in German text another Control with circular letters on it and the other a crown and a crest of some foreign country—I asked the prisoners where they lived—they were both together—Bull answered but I did not understand Smith s name—that was at the Mansion-House—from something Bull said to Smith Smith wrote on a piece of paper which I produce hit address and Bull wrote under it Ditto ditto — read — Smith 34 Gloucester-street Queen-square Bull ditto ditto —I afterwards went with my brother to No 34 Gloucester-street Queen-square—I took a key from the person of Bull—I believe it was the key of the street door—I found a bunch of keys on the sill of the window in the up-stairs room which the landlady pointed out as the prisoners room—one of those keys opened this dressing-case in which I found this small piece of paper No 2 with the border at the corner taken off also this small piece of paper No 12 — these two documents together with those numbered 1 and 20 formed an entire note—at the Mansion-House they were very anxious to get before the Lord Mayor—they had to wait some time—I said to Bull You must account to the Consul why you got this plate engraved —he said a person of the name of Santag at Hamburgh had ordered him to get it done—I told him Hamburgh was a large place—he said he had met him at a cafe e —that was all the account he gave of him—I proceeded to search the portmanteau identified by Mrs Naylor as belonging to Bull—I found in it this letter No 23 addressed to K Bull 34 Gloucester-street Qveen-square Blumsbrey dated the 23rd of Sept —I found this paint-box at the lodging and in it was this card No 17 —I also found this passport in Bull s portmanteau This was granted to Bull on the 12th of Aug and to be viad on his departure on the 14th of Aug from Stockholm JOHN FORRESTER I accompanied my brother to Mr Whiteman s house and on his going out at the door I remained in the place—I took charge of Smith searched him and found on him a bunch of keys—I took them to the lodging at No 34 Gloucester-street and with them opened the portmanteau pointed out by Mrs Naylor as belonging to Smith—I found in it a portfolio and a pocket-book and in the pocket-book I found this letter No 22 —I also found in the portfolio this bill for refreshment at Stockholm— this bill was to Smith dated Stockholm 31st July—on the back of it in different parts were the names of the five persons signing the genuine note also No 20 202 the number of the genuine note for 100 dollars —also found in the portfolio this paper— this was an undertaking by Bull to pay 210 dollars to Smith dated Stockholm 14th Aug GUSTAVUS WESTEN I am a translator of foreign languages Norwegian among others This letter No 22 has been in my hands for the purpose—of translating—this is a true translation of that into English—this is alto a correct translation of the letter No 23 from Norwegian into English and there it a correct translation of the Norwegian language on this note Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Is the letter in Norwegian or Swedish A Norwegian but there occurs one Swedish word in it—I fully understand it MR CLARKSON Q You have translated the letter in the second person singular thee and thou A Yes because it is so—those terms are never used except in endeared affection or persons are very intimate—it would be considered indecorous under any other circumstances—here is a correct impression from the brass block—the translation of it is precisely the same us far us it goes as the genuine note The letters as translated were as follows London Aug 28 1845 No 22 My dear Friend —At last I have the pleasure to be able to inform thee of my safe arrival at this place which took place on Sunday evening by the steam-boat John Bull My stay at Hamburgh was only two days very pleasant I got thy bill immediately paid The same man inquired if thou wast or soon wouldst go to Norway which I answered and further there was no more said about it The voyage from Hamburgh to this place was very stormy Twice we put to sea and twice we were compelled to put back to Cuxhaven We in consequence arrived fifty-two hours later than we should have done It was only a couple of days after which I really could recover myself and begin to think upon matters and things of which I have as yet not much to communicate to thee Nevertheless I am sure of the result of the case The drawing for the frame I have worked at for two days Yesterday I took it to an iron worker who promised to make it closely after the drawing It is so precisely measured off that not a hair is wanting thereon Now I am at work with the drawing for the letters so soon as it is ready as well as the stamps they shall be ordered Here are plenty of those who make such things when one has only money to pay with but money must not be spared then every thing goes With respect to the paper I shall no doubt be compelled to go to one of the small manufacturers in one of the minor towns however I have found a kind of red paper which is very nearly like We require only to dissolve it and put it in the mould Nevertheless there is much trouble attending it at the manufactories they do it immediately In the meantime I long for and rejoice at as well as it will be necessary for the progress of the case that thou without fail comest here as soon as thou canst Thou must absolutely come dost thou hear I have now a private lodging where my address is No 34 Gloucester-street Queen-sq Blumsbrey If thou goest to Hull and thence travellest by the steam-boat which is much cheaper than by the steam-carriage I will be there to receive thee thou canst have here a lodging at my landlady s a very nice woman by the side of me Thou needest not put up at any hotel which is so cursedly expensive only drive immediately here I have already spoken of it to my landlady This part of the town is very quiet no plays as in the other part of the town Thou needest no passport no one will ask thee about it As yet I have seen nothing here everything however is dear enough although I live as economically as I can When thou arrivest and everything is in order then first shall I derive pleasure from it Here it is very dull and God knows what the Englishmen in fact amuse themselves with They play seldom at cards billi as or any kind of game I find it terribly dull I will now hasten to execute what I have in hand and then leave here again A young Englishman who was on board the steam-boat has requested me that I would paint him for 5l If I can get time I will but however not before everything is brought in order Further I have not to communicate to thee but request of thee to come hither as soon as possible after the receipt of this Write when and by what opportunity I may expect thee Be assured that everything shall go well—that nothing is in the way Live well in the meantime Write soon and be heartily greeted by thy friend HEINRICH KLEMFORD Hamburgh Sept 23 1845 No 23 My Friend —Thy writing of the 28th of August I only received on the 9th of September that is the reason why I came so late to leave Stockholm It pleases me to see that thou art well and that everything goes according to wish I proceed from here direct to London on Friday the 26th by the steam-boat twelve o clock at night Thou must therefore be on the watch for my arrival in order to take me to thy lodgings Yours attachedly HEINRICH KLEMFORD Address—Mr Knut Bull No 34 Gloucester-street Queen-square Blumsbrey London WILLIAM TOTTIE Esq I am vice-consul from Norway This piece of pink paper is in the Norwegian language this was an impression from the block and this white paper is a translation of it— being ready corresponded as far as it went with the original note BRACHMAN FANZEN through an interpreter I am comptroller and secretary of the Bank of Norway—that is the national bank of the country and the only bank These four pieces form a genuine note of that bank—notes of this description circulate in Norway—they are received in payment of taxes and in all the public offices of the state—the notes of the Bank of Norway constitute almost the whole circulating medium of the country—if the word Lottery was cut off the top of this paper the remainder comprises the water-mark of a 100 dollars note of the Norway Bank Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Is the quality of the paper the same A The genuine note is thicker than the others—it is a note in value of ordinary circulation in Norway—it is not very common because it is only people of some property that possess 100 dollars—it is a note of the highest amount MR BODKIN Q What is the value in English money of a specie dollar A About 4s 6d JOSEPH BALL re-examined This plate was finished as it is now on the 3rd of Oct —that was not the time I showed it to Smith and Bull—it had been finished previously to that MR CLARKSON Q It has to have other work done has it not A

to defraud Henry Thomas Timson MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM HUBBLE I am landlord of the King s Head at Clapton—about a week or ten days previous to the 23rd of Dec last the prisoner came to my house—I cannot speak positively to the day—I knew him before—he came for a bottle of brandy for Mrs Tate as he had done before—I gave it him it came to 6s 6d —he tendered me this check for 10l in payment—I gave him the change—he paid me for the bottle of brandy out of the check—I stated to him that there was a bottle or two bottles owing for by Mrs Tate—he asked me who fetched it—I told him Mrs Tate s son—he said the son had deceived his mother—I wished him to name it to Mrs Tate to see if it was correct—he said he would be sure and do so—I kept the check till the 23rd of Dec when I paid it away to Mr Rafferty the collector to Truman and Hanbury s my brewers—I saw the prisoner taken in custody on the 5th of Jan by French the officer at his own house—he was not taken for this check but for another which I cashed for him—I told him the check I had cashed for him that day week had been returned to me as a forgery—he said it was given him either by Mr Timson or Mrs Tate—I said I had been to Mrs Tate and she denied all knowledge of it and it was for him to account from where he got the check—he dressed himself and accompanied me and the officer to the station-house Prisoner Q After you told me of the bottle of brandy being owing for by Mrs Tate was it paid for without applying to Mrs Tate for payment A It was paid when I sent in the bill—it was paid by Mrs Tate and without any dispute—it was not named to me when paid that you had mentioned it—you had been in the habit of coming to my house for brandy many times—I think not so often as once a week—I should think you have paid me six or seven checks for Mr William Timson—I cannot speak at to the exact number—those checks were always paid on presenting them at the bank I suppose—I did not present them myself—I paid them away and heard no more of them—I cannot say whether you had any gin at the time you had the brandy—you might have had—by your saying Mrs Tate s son had deceived his mother I concluded he had deceived her in some way—I cannot exactly say in what manner—that he had got the brandy without orders MR BODKIN Q How old is this boy A Fourteen JOSEPH RAFFERTY I am a collector to Messrs Truman Hanbury and Co —on the 23rd of Dec I received this check from Mr Hubble—I have written across it and my figures are at the back—I afterwards paid it into Messrs Hanbury the bankers in Lombard-street CHARLES BROWNING I am clerk to Messrs Hanbury s the bankers of Lombard-street—this check was paid into our bank on the 24th of Dec on account of Messrs Truman—it was passed through the clearing-house to Messrs Glynn s—I know that by reference to our books—I did it myself—I am the clearing-house clerk—I cannot swear to taking it myself but they send down every half hour to the clearing-house and it might have been sent away CAMPBELL HARDY I am clerk to Messrs Glynn s the bankers of Lombard-street—this check was paid into our bank on the 24th of Dec last—I cashed it myself—here is a memorandum of mine on it—Mr Henry Thomas Timson keeps an account with us—Mr George Carr Glynn is one of the partners—there are several others Prisoner Q How many times have you cashed checks for me A Never that I recollect LOUISA FRANCES JANE TATE I reside at Upper Clapton I am the wife of Mr Monkhouse Tate and the daughter of Mr William Timson—my father is in very infirm health—he is an inmate of Morden College Blackheath—I remember his leaving that asylum about the autumn of last year in consequence of some repairs about to be made there—he was at Clapton for some length of time—not for months the last time—he had been at Upper Clapton previously—the last time he left the asylum to come to Clapton was in June or July—I took a lodging for him near my residence at Clapton—previous to that he had an attack of paralysis—he was in an excessively infirm state of health—the prisoner s wife attended him as a nurse during the whole time of his residence at Clapton—he went back to the College about the end of Aug I believe—she accompanied him to the College then returned home and was discharged—during my father s residence at Clapton he occasionally had the prisoner s assistance—I believe my father employed him to write letters for him—I saw him writing and I believe it to have been letters but I have not seen them—I knew that my father was in the habit of receiving remittances from his cousin Mr Timson of Southampton—they were generally checks as far as I have seen—I do not know that the prisoner was employed by my father to change those checks for him occasionally—I can only imagine so—I have never seen him sent—I did not about the 23rd of Dec last send the prisoner with any check to Mr Hubble—I had done with him long before—I am certain I did not send him at any time in Dec —I never sent him to Mr Hubble with any check for 10l in my life—I know nothing of the check produced—I never saw it till it was shown to me at Worship-street Prisoner Q How long is it since you ceased to employ me A Several months since when I discovered your dishonesty—I never said to your wife about last Christmas that it would be a good job if you were sent out of the country—I do not think it relevant to the case to say whether I deal in tea wine and spirits without having a license—I would certainly rather not answer the question—I compounded with my creditors about three years back and paid 7s in the pound—a Mrs Bell was boarding with me at that time—there was not a quantity of plate and household furniture removed to Mr M Kenzie of Church-street Newington in the name of Mrs Bell—I never gave you a check to get cashed for myself nor for anybody that I recollect—I have not placed a basket with straw in it to encourage my neighbour s fowls to lay eggs in it MR BODKIN Q I believe your husband is still living A He is—he is not in a lunatic asylum—he is insane but in my own house and has been so for eight years—that has reduced our circumstances—he was formerly secretary to the Pelican-office HENRY THOMAS TIMSON I live near Southampton I have an account with Messrs Glynn—I have been in the habit of forwarding checks to my cousin at Clapton and occasionally two or three to Mrs Tate—this check is not written by me—no part of it—I never authorized anybody to draw it or sign my name to it—I never saw the prisoner till he was at Worship-street—I always draw my checks on plain paper WILLIAM TIMSON I am an inmate of Morden College Black heath—in the course of the last year I resided for some time at Clapton—during that time I was waited on by the prisoner s wife as my nurse—I employed the prisoner occasionally—I was in the habit of receiving from my cousin at Southampton checks for small sums very seldom beyond five pounds—this check is not my cousin s writing—I know nothing of this check—I never gave it to the prisoner to get it changed or had anything to say to him on the subject—I never saw the check in my life till I was before the Magistrate—I returned to the college I think on the 18th of Aug —I saw no more of the prisoner after that till the evening of the 13th Dec when he came to the college about six o clock—I was up at the time and my nurse was with me—I inquired how his wife did—he put a half-crown on the table for my nurse—I told her not to take it because it would be more useful to his family and children—she did not take it but left it on the table—he then put a sovereign into my hand and then immediately put in two more—I said I will not accept of this unless you inform me how you came by it or who it is that sent you —he said nothing but closed my hand fixed the money in it and said It is yours and he kissed my hand said there was a cab waiting and off he went—he appeared to me to have been drinking—he took a little gin and water at my place—just before I left Clapton I had occasionally employed him to write a few letters to persons with whom I had formerly been acquainted—he wrote the letters and I signed them myself—they were written to particular friends of my own—Mrs Tate had spoken to me about those letters before I went back to the college and in consequence of what she told me I desired him not to deliver any letters belonging to me or written by me to any of my friends because I was informed that he was an improper man to do it—I told him he was to give any letters or papers of mine that he had in his possession to Mrs Tate—that was the day before I left Clapton—I did not see him after that till the 13th of Dec and had no communication with him in any other way Prisoner Q Was it not through fear of being apprehended by the police as a begging-letter impostor that caused you to leave Upper Clapton in a hurry A I certainly left it the very next day under the apprehension that I might get into difficulties through you—I asked you to take something to drink the night you came to me at Blackheath—it was not a cart that you said was at the door—you have written letters from a copy of mine to friends of mine requesting assistance for me—I should think as many as twenty or thirty—I do not know as to one hundred but you have written I should say fifty first and last at different times—I think not more—they were all to private friends of mine all respectable gentlemen—they were to different persons—I have no recollection how many quires of paper you got from Mr Dawes the post-master at Clapton for me—I was very ill when at Clapton and had medical assistance and I did not pay those before I left—I left no other persons unpaid—I have no recollection of leaving Mr Allen of Morning-lane Hackney upwards of 5l in debt for spirits and wine—I did not leave the butcher between 2l and 3l in debt nor a farthing that I recollect—I did not leave Mr Dawes my landlord in debt for my apartments—I had a bed and a few other necessary things from Mr Morris the upholsterer which I did not pay for till after I left Clapton—they were all paid immediately after—I believe I left 7l odd unpaid for with Mr Reynolds the grocer—that has been paid since except one pound which is due to him now—I never told you that Mr Henry Thomas Timson was compelled to send me from time to time checks for small sums and that it was only that consideration that prevented me from publishing the memoirs of my life showing how my cousin s father in former days had robbed or wronged me of 2 000l —nothing of the sort MR BODKIN Q Was your living at Clapton in the state of health in which you were attended by considerable expense to you A Very great—at the college I have medical attendance free of expense—the letters the prisoner wrote for me he was requested to deliver—all that came to my hands from those letters was 10l from one gentleman who lives at Upper Clapton 1l from Mr Watchorn and half-a-guinea from Mr Fowler the banker of Princes-street that is all ANN NEWMAN I was nurse to Mr William Timson at Morden College in Aug Last and was in constant attendance on him from the 20th of Aug till the present time—I never saw the prisoner there till the 13th of Dec —he came that evening at half-past six o clock—he was much intoxicated—he came in and Mr Timson said Who is that —he said Charles —he sat down in a chair close by the side of Mr Timson got hold of his hand and said he was so very glad to see him and he had come to ask him a particular favour—Mr Timson asked him what it was—he asked Mr Timson if he would give him two or three lines as a recommendation for a labourer on the Brighton railroad—Mr Timson said he would do so and desired me to give him pen ink and paper which I did and he wrote him I should say four or five lines—he read it to the prisoner—I cannot say the purport of it—the prisoner folded it up and put it in his pocket—he then sat down in a chair and made a great deal of fuss with Mr Timson shaking and kissing his hand and presently he took half-a-crown and put it on the table—Mr Timson said What docs that mean —he said It is for your nurse —Mr Timson told him he would not accept of it and he was sure his nurse would not—I did not at the time—Mr Timson told him to take it home to his wife and family for they were more in want of it than I was—he was talking some time to Mr Timson—I cannot say what he said and he went down on his knee before Mr Timson closed his hand kissed it and put a sovereign into it—Mr Timson said What does this mean Charles I shall not accept of anything of the kind unless you tell me for what reason you give it me or from whence it comes —he made no answer—he sat some time—Mr Timson had a glass of gin-and-water and the prisoner partook of it—they talked of one thing and another for about half an hour or better till Mr Timson seemed quite fatigued—he asked Mr Timson to spend Christmas with him he could provide him a nice bed and plenty of everything—Mr Timson said his health was not fit for that he could never come—the prisoner had some gin-and-water and a glass of wine also which I gave him—I left the room for a short time to prepare Mr Timson s bed—I came back in about five minutes and Mr Timson then had three sovereigns in his hand—he opened his hand and said I have got three sovereigns —I said Indeed have you —the prisoner jumped up out of the chair and said Good night God bless you take it it is yours —he said I will not keep it unless you tell me where you got it or from whence it came —he jumped up opened the door and went away saying I have got a cab and a man waiting —that was all I heard Prisoner Q Did you read the letter of recommendation as you call it which he gave me A No WILLIAM FRENCH police-constable N 151 I took the prisoner into custody at his own residence No 16 Margaret-street Stoke Newington on the 5th of Jan about half-past eleven o clock at night—Mr Hubble was with me—I have known the prisoner some time—I believe he has been formerly in the police—I found the prisoner in his bed-room—I called Mr Hubble in to charge him—Mr Hubble said he charged him with uttering a forged check on that day week—he said he knew nothing at all about it he could not charge his memory with anything of the kind for the last month past he had been in the habit of going there but he could not say as to the last time—Mr Hubble requested that he might call on Mrs Tate as we went along—the prisoner wished particularly to know if he was in custody I being in plain clothes at the time—he said if he knew he was in custody he would make us pay for it he would make something out of it—I said I was an officer and if he wished to sue anybody he might sue me I should take the responsibility upon myself—I then took him into custody—he said he was quite agreeable to go with me but he would make the old b—pay for it—he also said he would open a ball before the Magistrate—he said he had many letters at home which he had written for Mr Timson and which I found and which are now in possession of Mr Bush Prisoner Q Did not I tell you where to find them A No—you said there were some at home—I do not recollect your saying they were in the teapot—your wife gave them to me out of a box—I believe you said you had been made a tool of by the old gentleman at Blackheath and that he had promised to give you half of whatever might be realized in the event of your writing him more letters to induce you to do so WILLIAM MATE police-constable N 28 I was at the station when the prisoner was brought there—after he had been locked up a short time he requested he might write to his wife—I furnished him with some paper—he sat in a chair and said Well Sergeant Mate I suppose I shall be fully committed on this —I said I knew nothing about it—he said I have been made a complete tool of for other people and as for that check I received it of Mrs Tate —I said I do not know it does not look like a female s writing —he said As for that I can imitate five or six different handwritings —Mr Hubble and the other constable then came in and it was dropped Prisoner As God is my judge I never made such a remark to that policeman Witness He did make that remark as he sat in the chair—there was nobody else by WILLIAM ATTEWELL I am a hair-dresser and live at Upper Clapton I know the prisoner by his being in the neighbourhood for the last three or four years—I have received a note from him and have often seen him writing at Mr Gibson s—this check is very similar to the note I have in my possession—I have acquired a knowledge of his handwriting by having seen him write—I should judge the check to be his handwriting—that is my belief Prisoner Q Did not you shave Mr Timson while my wife was his nurse A Yes—in consequence of a remark I made respecting her character you came to my shop and assaulted me about three months since—you wanted to know what I had got to say against your or your wife s character—I said I thought neither you or your wife were any better than you ought to be—you began to swear—I told you it was no use kicking up a row with me— you had been there the night previous kicking up a noise —you said you would d—d well shave me and struck out at me but I avoided the blow and put you out of the shop—I got my coat torn in the scuffle—I took out a warrant for you had you up to Worship-street police-office and you were fined 15s for the damage done to my coat—that was at the time Mr William Timson lodged at Mr Dawes—the origin of the dispute was my leaving some combs there and having a great deal of trouble to get them—I have not spoken to you since or you to me COURT Q What opportunities had you of seeing him write A During Mr Timson s stay at Upper Clapton I have seen him there five or six mornings out of the week writing at the table and I have had opportunities of seeing the letters then—it was a very small room—I never read any of the letters he was writing—I had no further opportunity of seeing him write— check read — London Dec 3 1845 Messrs Glynn and Co pay to Mr William Timson or bearer 10l HENRY THOMAS TIMSON William Base clerk to Messrs Bush and Mullens solicitors for the prosecution proved the service of a notice on the prisoner on the 4th of Feb in Newgate that Mr William Timson and Mary Ann Newman were to be examined at the trial Prisoner s Defence I first became acquainted with Mr William Timson on the 24th of Dec 1844 and was employed by him as a messenger he was at that time on a visit to Mrs Tate his daughter it was limited to a week but Mr Timson for purposes which will appear presently was seized with an attack of epilepsy and was unable to return home it was then he employed Mr Garratt of Hackney who will certify that his illness was mostly caused by excessive drink as he has many times told me and Mr Allen will state the quantity of drink consumed by him when Mr Timson found his money nearly exhausted he employed me to write from two to three hundred letters ten twenty forty and forty-five a day to many gentlemen and many to Mr Henry Thomas Timson who he informed me from time to time transmitted him checks varying from 5l to 10l he employed me to cash them I have done so many times but having a severe injury on the head I am unable to recollect the dates—he received on the strength of the letters I wrote from his dictation nearly 100l and a copy of one letter in his own handwriting was in possession of the police together with other letters and a copy of certain bankruptcy proceedings to the amount of upwards of 9 000l which he many times told me Mr Henry Thomas Timson would be glad to get hold of after thirteen weeks residence at Clapton he returned to Blackheath leaving every tradesman in debt he afterwards returned and lodged first at Mr Alby s the ironmonger s who will speak as to the state of Mr Timson while there he had not been there a week before I cashed him a check for 5l at Mr Hubble s he afterwards moved to Mr Dawes the post-master s whose brother William I will call and who received instructions from Mr Timson to deliver to him any letters addressed to Charles Marlow Esq it being agreed to distinguish such letters from my own from private friends in the course of a few days he got me to write sixty letters without any signature as he said he would sign them himself and which I posted directed to different gentlemen he wished me to write again I refused when I found he dictated such infamous falsehoods for the purpose of exciting commiseration he subsequently sent about for another person to write for him he wished me to wait on the gentlemen personally I did so and among them I may mention Mr Alderman Moon with whose son I had an interview I have a list of thirty-four persons whom I waited on but every one of them except two or three expressed the greatest disgust at his conduct and said he was an accomplished old swindler I told him the result of my applications and he wrote another letter to Mr Timson for money which I do not think was attended to as after a sufficient time for an answer he said his cousin ought to do something for him as the money in his cousin s hands ought to be his for his father had robbed him of 200 000l and he said if he did not send him something he would get out of him what he could he afterwards left Upper Clapton indebted to almost every one the two medical gentlemen and even my wife and myself were not paid On the 10th of Nov I received a communication from him enclosing a 10l check desiring me to pay his bill which was due to Mr Hubble I did so and if Mr Hubble or the solicitor for the prosecution would take the trouble to examine and compare time place and circumstances I should be exonerated altogether I beg the check produced may be compared with the begging letters in the hands of the police I assert that every time I cashed checks it has been by the order of Mr Timson or Mrs Tate although Mrs Tate says she never gave me a check to pay bills—I have highly respectable persons to prove she received a check of 10l of Mr Henry Thomas Timson and I can produce the grocer s errand-boy Charles Spinks to prove that since Christmas last he has delivered to me two letters from Mrs Tate at my own house and Mrs Clark will state that I went out for the purpose of waiting on Mrs Tate by her orders I had the check from her to pay for the brandy I have a wife and four children and I too sincerely doat on them to run the risk of punishment and separation from them for the paltry consideration of a few pounds I have been an unconscious tool in the hands of artful and designing persons and I solemnly declare my innocence Mr William Timson says he left Upper Clapton because of my bad character that he was frightened of being apprehended in consequence of my delivering these letters and yet he afterwards gives me a recommendation then again he says I left directly after giving him the money the evening I called on him at Blackheath and the servant says I stopped for half an hour and she did not see what kind of recommendation it was it was no recommendation to the Brighton Railway Company WILLIAM DAWES I keep the Post-office at Clapton I received orders from Mr William Timson to deliver letters directed to Charles Marlow Esq to him—I remember delivering him one letter so addressed but no other KATE SAYER In Aug last I saw the prisoner with a paper in his hand which I believe to be a check but I do not know because it was doubled up in his hand—he said it was a check—it was in his own place—about half-anhour afterwards I saw him with some sovereigns and silver in his hand and a bill that he had been paying as he said from that check—I was not present when anything passed between him and Mr Timson about refusing to write any more letters—I know he wrote a good many letters for Mr Timson—I have seen him sitting writing at his own home and saying he was going to write for the old gentleman MR BODKIN Q Was this at the time Mr Timson was living at Clapton A Yes MARY HURSANT I keep a shop at Clapton—we have two businesses—I attend to one and my husband to the other—Mr Timson was a customer of ours—he had a bill rather over 2l which was paid by the prisoner in the early part of Sept last by a 10l check—I gave the change—I recollect other checks being changed previously but I cannot recollect the amounts—this was the last MR BODKIN Q What enables you to say it was in Sept A By my cash-book—I have not got it with me—it is merely a private memorandum that Mr Timson s account was paid on that day—I have referred to it knowing the question might be asked—I should say it was not at the latter end of Aug —I cannot say what I did with the check—our business is extensive—it went with other checks in payment HENRY THOMAS TIMSON re-examined I remember my cousin s return to the College from Clapton—I think after that I transmitted him a check for 10l —I sent it to him at Morden College and I think I sent him a 5l banknote—I sent a check to Mrs Tate about that time—I sent one check I think for 10l and another I think for 17l 10s or 17l I am not sure—one of the checks was to pay the debts contracted during his illness MRS TATE re-examined Shortly after my father went back I remember receiving a communication from Mr Henry Timson—I did not entrust the prisoner with any part of the paper that Mr Timson sent me—I received no money from the prisoner after my father had gone back to Morden College GUILTY of uttering Aged 30 — Transported for Ten Years There were three other indictments against the prisoner

received this letter from him—it is his handwriting—I know his handwriting having corresponded with him—I never saw an order of the Court of Chancery but he said an order had been made directing us to pay a certain sum into the Bank to the Accountant-General s account— letter read — Southampton-buildings 21st June 1845 Dear Sir On the other side I send you three checks for your signature—the first

General unpaid costs account —this is my signature and I wrote across it Bank of England on account of the Accountant-General —that appears to have been since struck our and Messrs Gosling and Co has been written on it since it was in my hand—I believe that to be Mr Garey s handwriting—when I had signed the check I think I enclosed it to Mr Triston for Mr Foster s signature—Mr Triston is solicitor for Mr Foster my co-trustee and he had been solicitor for me also—this is the letter I sent—between June and the January following I wrote to Mr Foster respecting the money—I do not think I wrote to the prisoner or had any interview with him on the subject between Nov and Jan —I wrote to him requesting a copy of the receipt might be sent down—on the 18th Jan 1846 I received from him this letter

dated 5th Nov 1844 Thomas Jones Bellamy and Charles James Foster have paid into the Bank of England the sum of 2 596l 17s which is placed to my account as Accountant-General and to the credit of this matter the general unpaid costs account in the books kept at the Bank of England and in my office as appears by the receipt of Mr W R West one of the cashiers of the Bank dated 25th inst hereby annexed WILLIAM ROSSSELL A G Receipt London 25th June 1845 Received pursuant to an order dated 5th Nov 1844 of Thomas Jones Bellamy and Charles James Foster the sum of 2 596l 17s which money is placed to the account of William Russell Esq as Accountant-General of the Court of Chancery and to the credit of the matter of the Rev Edward Frank a person of unsound mind The general unpaid costs account in the books kept at the Bank for the suitors of the Court of Chancery For the Governor and Company of the Bank of England W R West—2 596l 17s —entered—F H WARD Q You received this on the 18th of Jan —on Tuesday the 20th did you come to town A I did in consequence of receiving this letter—I went with Mr Foster my co-trustee to the Accountant-General s office I think on the Wednesday the 21st—we made inquiries there—we have since paid the money into the Bank of England to the account of the Accountant-General Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Will you give me the names of the children of the late Edward Frank A Jemima Mary Bacon Frank Edward Bacon Frank and Rodolphus Bacon Frank—I was an attorney twenty-five years ago—I was never in partnership with Mr Triston or any one—I was constituted a trustee for the younger children under a deed—I do not know that that deed is in Court—I think Mr Triston has it—Mr Triston was the attorney for the trustees on the occasion of the drawing of that deed—I think Mr Triston was not the attorney for the trustees in the matter of the petition in Chancery on which the order was made—I think Mr Garey was—the order recites that a counsel appeared for the cestuique trust and also for the trustees—Mr Garey was the attorney employed for the cestuique trust and for myself and Mr Foster but one of the parties wrote me a letter to say that Mr Garey was going to receive the 10 000l —I then wrote up to Mr Triston and I wrote to Mr Garey also and I desired Mr Triston immediately if that was so to retain counsel which he did and that was altered—in the matter of the petition Mr Triston was merely to see that the order was drawn up right—counsel was certainly employed by Mr Triston as our solicitor for that particular purpose and nothing else—we have paid Mr Triston s bill of costs and Mr Garey s also—I think Mr Triston s bill of costs was between 300l and 400l in the matter of that petition—it was sent to me approved of by Mr Garey—those were accounts of the trustees costs—Mr Triston was certainly not acting throughout the whole of that petition as the solicitor for the trustees—I do not know how the 400l was incurred—it was a complicated business—they had to go into the Ecclesiastical Court for there was another will and Mr Garey had the conducting of the whole business—Mr Triston received his costs and Mr Garey said they were correct Q Do I understand you to say that Mr Triston had your authority to give Mr Wakefield a brief to appear on the hearing of the petition A I wrote to Mr Garey and then I wrote to Mr Triston to go to Mr Garey and to see that it was done—I was informed that the order was drawn so that Mr Garey was to receive the money—I said I should have no objection to trust Mr Garey myself but I could not as a trustee and I desired Mr Triston to see that the order was to pay to the trustees and not to him—there were two policies of insurance—I never understood they were to be handed over to Mr Triston as my solicitor—I acted entirely in this case under the advice of Mr Garey with the exception that when I heard he was to receive the money I said No it must not be so it must be paid to the trustees —the policies were got through Mr Garey s exertions—the commission of lunacy was taken out against Mr Frank in 1825 I think—the commencement of his lunacy was declared to be from 1816—his income was about 7 000l or 8 000l a year—in 1817 he made a deed of settlement of the Pontefract estate on his younger children—that deed became invalid in consequence of the commencement of the lunacy being declared to be in 1816—there were two other children living at that time—after Mr Frank became a lunatic an allowance was made to himself and his family—that allowance to the younger children continued up to the time of his death—immediately upon his death the heir filed a bill to set aside the settlement of the Pontefract estate—Messrs Foster Evans and Smith were concerned as attorneys for the younger children in the first instance—in consequence of Mr Frank s death the three younger children had nothing except what their aunts chose to give them—their allowance was taken away the instant Mr Frank died—Foster Evans and Smith were never concerned in the suit in Chancery—Mr Garey was concerned as their solicitor at first I think but I do not know—Edward Bacon Frank one of the younger children had no property of his own—he was entitled to a reversion of one-third of 20 000l on the death of his aunts Catherine and Elizabeth—he told me he had sold that reversion for 400l and I advised him to go to his attorney directly and pay the money and get it back—I thought a court of equity would relieve him from such an imprudent bargain—Mr Garey undertook the defence of this suit for the three younger children—he got an issue at law directed as to the validity of the settlement of 1816—Mr Garey was then in the firm of Low Garey and Sweeting—I believe Mr Garey was the acting man—it was finally decided by a verdict at law that the deed was a valid deed—he also succeeded in getting back the reversion—the proceedings in Chancery connected with both those matters and the proceedings at law were very expensive—Messrs Low Garey and Sweeting behaved remarkably well on that occasion and did not ask the parties to advance much money and immediately afterwards I paid them the whole amount—I do not know that Mr Garey advanced money to go to trial out of his own private funds—I never heard of it—Mr Garey on the part of the three younger children carried on the proceedings to recover the money on the policies—he was concerned for the younger children and for myself at first to avoid expense—he got the offices to pay the policies—it was a very difficult case—it was some years before the offices would pay the policies—Mr Frank died a natural death—it is a question still to be decided whether the offices shall pay the interest on the policies—Mr Garey quitted the firm of Low Garey and Sweeting about two or three years ago when Mr Low died—all these matters of course required outlays of money on the part of the solicitor but Mr Garey might have had any money he liked—before the deed was decided to be valid I should say the younger children were merely dependent upon bounty for their existence—the whole weight of the matter was on myself the contest with the elder brother as to the validity of the deed—I advanced them money before it was decided and would have advanced anything—I went with 400l in my pocket—they asked me for 200l and I gave it them—I would have given them anything—I forget what the proceedings came to—I think we paid 700l as extra costs—the outlay was not so much as I expected it would have been—I think it was under 2000l —the other party had to pay costs—I do not know how much—it was a very heavy concern altogether—sales were made of portions of the Pontefract property—immediately I knew the value of the assistance we had from Low Garey and Sweeting I said of course they ought to do the other business the purchase and they were employed—I think Mr Garey always conducted the business connected with that—the monies upon those sales were paid to another attorney—Captain Mainwaring was my co-trustee and he employed a separate solicitor—I employed Mr Garey because there should not be three solicitors—I do not know of my own knowledge that large sums passed through his hands in the progress of that business—they were paid into Coutts and Co s by Mr Govet—I think there was one sum paid in by Mr Garey and the rest by Mr Govet and one or two by Mr Triston—Mr Garey had the management of the business—he was to send the deeds to Mr Govet for Captain Mainwaring s signature—they were returned to Mr Govet and then Mr Govet paid the money in—Mr Garey did not receive the money from the purchasers—Mr Govet did—he was Capt Manwaring s solicitor and Captain Mainwaring thought it right and proper that he should he did not know Mr Garey—I do not know that much of the money was paid to Mr Garey and by him handed over to Mr Govet—I know that the money was carried to our account as the trustees at Coutts —it may have all passed through Mr Garey s hands but I do not know it and I do not think it did—I recollect that he received some deposits which I requested he would pay into Coutts and he promised me he would—Mr Edward Bacon Frank went with Mr Garey to sell some part of the property and Mr Garey received the deposits—Mr Edward Bacon Frank was Mr Garey s client—I suppose Mr Garey had a bill of costs against him but not on that account—that would tell into the trustees account—I do not know that his bill of costs against the three younger children was as much as 900l in Jan last—that was the trust property—it had nothing to do with that—a bill of costs for 900l was delivered yesterday I believe or the day before—I do not know that a bill of costs is due by the Franks—I had no bills delivered to me till the night before last—I was told in coming to town to go to the office and there was Mr Garey s attorney with some papers saying they were indebted to him 900l —I do not know anything about it—I should say Mr Garey succeeded in getting for the three younger children property to the value of between 30 000l or 40 000l —I should say the Pontefract estate was worth 30 000l or more and the policies 10 000l —the interest on them is considerable—I do not know that Mr Garey advanced money out of his pocket from time to time to Edward Bacon Frank to support him—it is four or five years ago that the verdict at law was recovered—it was a long time pending after Mr Frank s death—I do not know that the Master of the Rolls had pronounced the settlement deeds to be bad before Mr Garey took it to issue—it is not so CHARLES JAMES FOSTER Esq I am a barrister and have chambers in Lincoln s-inn I am co-trustee with Mr Bellamy Mr Triston was my solicitor I recollect in June last his bringing me this letter—I recollect receiving the check better than I recollect receiving the letter—it was immediately after the date of the letter about the 25th of June I should say—the check had at that time been signed by my co-trustee Mr Bellamy—I signed the check—I had an account at that time at Coutts jointly with Mr Bellamy—my impression is that at the time I signed it the words Gosling and Co were not on it—when I had signed the check I gave it to Mr Triston to take it to Mr Garey—I was not acquainted with Mr Garey personally except relating to this trust—he had not been acting for me that I am aware of in any way—in Dec last I received this letter from Mr Bellamy I think it was the 8th of Dec —in consequence of that letter I saw Mr Garey at his place of business in Southampton-buildings—I asked him if he had the office copy receipt of the Accountant-General for the amount of this money—he said he expected to have it in a day or two or something to that effect—I had two or three interviews with him subsequent to this shortly after—I cannot recollect precisely what passed about the money having been paid further than I was given to understand the money had been paid by Mr Garey—I made an arrangement with him that the certificate or receipt was to be sent to Mr Bellamy at Brighton—I recollect Mr Bellamy coming to town about the 21st of Jan on a Tuesday—I accompanied him to the Accountant-general s on the Wednesday I think—in this month I accompanied Mr Bellamy to the Chancery-office Bank of England and the sum mentioned in the order 2 596l 17s was paid by me conjointly with Mr Bellamy Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Who has got the trust deed A I think Mr Triston has it—I became trustee in 1837—there was a deed appointing me trustee—I have seen Mr Garey perhaps a dozen or half a dozen times—I believe the deed of settlement appointed me trustee—he had not been solicitor to the trustees before I became a trustee—there were no trustees before I became one—I am trustee under the deed of 1837 which carried out the former deed—I am thirty-seven years of age—there was a previous deed in which trustees had been named—they died and in pursuance of something in that deed I was appointed one of the new trustees—I have no personal knowledge whether Mr Triston was solicitor for the old trustees—he applied to me to become a trustee—I should say he continued to act as solicitor for the trustees—I was certainly not the active trustee—I always dealt with him as the solicitor—when I signed the check I handed it over to Mr Triston as solicitor for the trustees to take to Mr Garey that was my impression certainly—Mr Triston did not receive the monies on the policies—we received the monies ourselves—we did not hand them over to Mr Triston—I took the check to Coutts myself—Mr Triston acted in the matter as my solicitor as well Q Solicitor for the trustees A I speak according to my own understanding—by Mr Triston s advice I sanctioned Mr Garey s employment to conduct the petition on behalf of the trustees—it was said it could be done in a less expensive way if he appeared for all parties—the petition was if I recollect right to deliver the policies to Mr Garey on behalf of all parties—I am speaking from recollection—the order directs that they should be delivered to Mr Triston as solicitor for the trustees after the cestuique trust have paid off Sir William Cooke s charges—I believe they were delivered to Mr Triston—Mr Triston attended with them at the office when the money was paid MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q I believe Mr Triston is your personal solicitor A Yes—the petition I have spoken of was the petition upon which the order was founded for the payment of the money to the Accountantgeneral—it was a petition by the parties beneficially interested and also by the trustees—I understood that that petition was conducted by Mr Garey on behalf of all parties JOHN HOWELL TRISTON I am a solicitor I was the solicitor of Mr Foster and was also the solicitor for the trustees Mr Bellamy and Mr Foster generally—I recollect receiving this check from Mr Bellamy—I took it to Mr Foster and obtained his signature on the next day and on the next day handed it to Mr Garey—the words Messrs Goslings and Co at that time were not on the check—it was crossed Bank of England to the account of the Accountant-General —in November I saw Mr Garey two or three times I think on the subject of the Accountant-General s certificate and the Bank receipt—on that occasion I said that Mr Bellamy and Mr Foster wished to have the Accountant-General s receipt and to know whether he had obtained it for the money paid in—Mr Garey said he had not got it that it was at the Accountant-General s office—I assumed in my question that the money had been paid in—I did not ask him whether it had—I asked him for the receipt for the money paid in—on each occasion he said he had not had time to send for it or something of that kind—Mr Garey conducted the business of the petition on which the order proceeded Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q How came you to ask him for the receipt for the money paid in A Because the check was paid to him for the purpose of paying in the money—I was to have the receipt at the request of Messrs Foster and Bellamy as their general solicitor as solicitor for the trustees—I delivered a brief at a late stage of the proceeding to Mr Wakefield and for a particular purpose on the hearing of the petition before the order was made—Mr Wakefield s name is mentioned in the order—he was to represent Messrs Bellamy and Foster—I sent in my bill of costs—the petition was pending only a few months I think speaking from recollection—the amount of my bill of costs at that time was 300 and odd pounds—it was a bill of costs running on for business done for ten years—I had not been paid for that time—it was relating to the policies—whilst those proceedings were going on I had not been paid—in the matter of the petition I should say that there was not above 20l due—the next thing that was made on the hearing was the order—I had appeared on the petition in another capacity as representing Sir William Cook the committee of the estate—I had the policy in my hand as solicitor—I represented him when I delivered the brief to Mr Wakefield—he appeared for Sir W Cook—I took the petition to Mr Foster—he perused and corrected it—I cannot say whether it was sent to Mr Bellamy to be looked at—I do not think Mr Bellamy saw it then—Mr Foster corrected it for both of them—I think I did not say anything to Mr Garey on the subject of the receipt before November—I have no recollection of that—I took the check to Mr Garey myself—I recollect seeing him—I only handed it to him—I recollect no conversation but I presume I must have said Here is the check from the trustees —Mr Bellamy was the only trustee in the suit in which Mr Garey was concerned for the cestuique trust—Mr Foster had nothing to do with that suit only Mr Bellamy and Captain Mainwaring—I was only concerned for Mr Bellamy—when Mr Garey took the case up it was considered to be a very difficult one MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q What was the purpose for which you delivered the brief to Mr Wakefield A That the deeds relating to the policies might be delivered to the trustees themselves the original petition as framed by Mr Garey was that the deeds and policies should be delivered to him MR CHAMBERS Q When Sir William Cook s charges were paid off did you hand the deeds over to yourself as the trustees solicitor A No I think I handed them to Mr Foster—he had them latterly for some time—he then returned them—they were handed to me I think for the purpose of production at the insurance office when the money was paid but Mr Foster had them GEORGE STRANGE I am a clerk in the house of Gosling and Co bankers I remember receiving this check at the banking house—at that time Mr Garey kept an account with us—it was paid in to the credit of his account—I gave him credit for it—there is a memorandum on it which I made at that time—it went to Coutts and was paid by them not to me but to another clerk Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Do you keep Mr Garey s account A We have the account and I credited it—I keep Mr Garey s account myself—I do my part—I have credited him with the proceeds of the check and have made an entry of it—it is in my handwriting—here is Mr Garey s account—this is our cash-book—when we receive a check we give him credit for it in the cash-book—when we receive a check or money we merely make a memorandum to whose account it is to be carried—that is the first process and the second is to copy it into the book to carry it into the account—this is my cash-book which I keep—I receive the check over the counter and make an entry in the receipt-book—it would be the duty of some other clerk to look at these books and to carry the entry into Mr Garey s regular account—that is not my duty—the clerk is here who received it—there is no particular clerk for that—this is the original entry of the thing—besides this the customer has his account in the ledger—he never sees this book nor the ledger—he has the copy of it—a copy of his account—the account is posted marked and checked—it is not the business of the house to show this book—he would see it if he applied for it but he never does apply—what he sees is another book which ought to be a copy of this—he has a copy of it itself the pass-book which is a copy of the account in the ledger—there is the folio of the check and the checking which refers to the folio of ledger COURT Q Do you pay Mr Garey s checks A I pay if they are presented to me or some other clerk—the indorsement on the check Gosling and Co instead of the Bank of England looks very much like Mr Garey s handwriting—I should say that it was his handwriting MR CHAMBERS Q Who does keep Mr Garey s account A It is the general business of the posting not the business of one clerk but the buisness of one two or three—we should want the whole of Fleet-street if we had a clerk for every account—the pass-book is kept by first one and then another—I do not keep Mr Garey s account—it may be kept by one clerk or another—it is posted from the cash-book to the ledger FREDERICK STRACHAN I am a clerk at Messrs Goslings—I was so in June last—I took this check to Messrs Coutts—it was paid—I returned and settled my account in the ordinary way Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q I believe bankers will not pay crossed checks across the counter they must come through a banker A Yes—if a check were crossed to the Bank of England it would depend upon circumstances whether it could be cashed across the counter—if a total stranger brought a check for a large sum of money that was crossed to the Bank of England I should not pay it MR WADDINGTON Q Without that had been struck out and the other substituted it could not have been obtained A Through a banker it could without striking out the indorsement of Bank of England and Accountant-General and putting some other banker on it—if the words Bank of England remained there it might have been done if coming through a banker—some would do it and others not—some houses will pay only to the bankers mentioned and some will pay to any banker ALFRED KINNS I am just turned fourteen years old—I was a writing clerk in Mr Garey s office last Nov —I went to his office on the 10th of Nov and left on the 24th of Jan —this paper is in my handwriting— the copy of certificate and receipt said to be forged —it was written on Saturday the 17th of Jan —there are some figures which are not in my handwriting—this 28th of June the 2s 4d in the margin and the word 5th over the second line on the second page—there were no blanks left there by me—those are not in my handwriting—I do not know when they were written—I did not leave them blanks—they have been written since I wrote the rest—I wrote something else which has been scratched out—Mr Garey gave me the piece of paper on which that is written while in his outer office—he brought it to me—when he did so there was this round black mark on the side—when he gave me the piece of paper he told me not to spoil it because it was folded in a particular manner and at the same time he gave me another piece of paper that of which this is a copy which I was to copy it from—I believe that was in Mr Garey s handwriting MR HAYWARD re-examined I served notice on Mr Garey to produce the paper of which this purports to be a copy in Newgate on the 24th of this month—this is a copy of the notice—I served it personally on him and I asked him to let his attorney have the notice as early as he possibly could—he stated his attorney would be there in a very few moments and he would give it to him and as I left the prison I met his attorney and told him I had served it with a repetition of the notice to produce the same writing at Bow-street—I had served him with a similar notice on the 19th of Feb last when he was in company with his solicitor Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Who was the officer employed to take Mr Garey into custody A Inspector Haynes of the detective force—he seized a bundle of papers or letters and when it was found they did not in any way relate to this charge he was instructed to hand them back to Mr Garey immediately and I believe he did so on the same night—I believe he took no others—they were found in his pocket COURT Q You saw them A Yes—I examined them—I did not see the paper now sought for—I should say it was not among them—I did not examine the whole myself—I assisted in the examination JOHN HAYNES I am an inspector of the detective police—I apprehended the prisoner—I took no papers except what he had about his person—I examined them at the police-office Bow-street in the presence of Mr Clark and Mr Hayward—none of them related in any way to the charge upon which he was apprehended and I therefore gave them back to him again—I gave back all that I took from him Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Did you keep them in your peronal possession all the time A They were never out of my sight—no one went inside Mr Garey s house with me when I went to apprehend him—Inspector Shackell was waiting outside with me—I think there were four clerks in the office and his son—there were a vast many papers but I had no instructions to seize them ALFRED KINNS re-examined There was no round mark like this on the Paper I copied this from—it was half a sheet of this kind of paper and a little piece—while I was writing it the prisoner came into the office—I had left a blank for the name William Russell Accountant-General—he wanted to know why I had left it blank and told me to fill it in or else it would not be a copy—before I had finished it I left the outer office and went into his room and he told me I was not to come into his room he would tell me how to do it in the outer office—there was no one in the outer office while I was writing it—Mr Garey had three other clerks—it was about six o clock in the evening—I remember taking some letters to the post that night— Mr Garey s son was in the inner office when I went in —this letter marked A was a letter that I took to the Post-office that night—I know there was a letter directed to Mr Bellamy among those I took that night—Mr Garey told me to see how much the postage came to and to put on the stamps—I ascertained the weight and was obliged to put more than one stamp upon it—I was not in time for the post—I am able to say this is a letter that I took to the post on that Saturday night—I know there was something inside the letter by the feel of it—I left the prisoner s service on Saturday evening the 24th—I gave the paper I had copied to Mr Garey together with the one I copied from SAMUEL PARKINSON I am a clerk in the Accountant-General s office When an order is made for any payment into the name of the Accountant-General at the Bank the solicitor brings the order to the Accountant-General s office and the clerk who takes the order reads it to see what is to be done under it—whatever the order directs to be done the clerk draws—in such an order as this there are three separate sums to be paid into the Accountant-General s name to three separate and distinct accounts—one of these sums requires that the interest of it should be verified by affidavit and then as far as that sum is concerned the solicitor must bring an affidavit of the amount of interest to be paid under the order—from such an order as this the clerk would draw three directions one sum to go to one account one to a second and one with interest to a third—the certificates or directions are then handed over to another clerk to examine with the order—he then draws another certificate which we call in the office a duplicate but it is not exactly a duplicate as the tense is altered—the first direction is to pay it in and the other direction is having paid it in it is a duplicate with that difference—the first direction is taken into the Accountant-General whose order the clerk proceeds to draw and if the Accountant-General finds the certificates are drawn agreeably to the order he signs them—the second certificate is not signed then—it is put by—the first is entered in a book and then delivered to the solicitor who takes it to the Bank pays the money and obtains a Bank receipt—he then brings that receipt back to the Accountant-General s office signed by the cashier which is compared with the duplicate and if found to be correct it is annexed to the Bank receipt signed by the Accountant-General and taken to the office of the clerk of accounts a branch of the Report-office where they are both filed—office copies are then made of them—the originals are filed and kept in the Report-office for the purposes of Court—the office copies are received by the Court as evidence—they are brought to the Accountant-General s office and put into pigeon-holes under letters for the solicitors to take away— looking at the forged document —this is very nearly in the form of such an office copy as I have described but in those the price is 3s 10d and this is 2s 4d —a wrong price is charged for it—they charge so much per folio at the Report-office for copying and the price is always put in the margin—it has nothing to do with the contents of the order—the document itself is in the ordinary form of an office-copy such as I have described—there is no price on the original—the 2s 4d is not a copy of anything—such a certificate as this would not be a certificate under this order because it directs to pay three different sums—the original could not possibly be drawn so this is such a certificate as would be made if there was but one sum Q Do you observe any appearance of a stamp upon that A Yes—it is very faint now—it purports to be the stamp of the Report-office I have not the slightest doubt of it—the office copies issued from the Report-office always bear such a stamp as that—that is the evidence of their being office-copies—I have not the books of the Accountant-General here—I have searched the books all through—I have an original certificate here which the Bank sends to us of a night when the money is paid in—it is the practice for us to receive private intimation from the Bank every night of the money that has been paid in—I have searched every book of the Accountant-General in which entries would be made of this proceeding from the 5th of Nov 1844 up to the prisoner s committal and I find no entry whatever of any proceeding—the direction-book is kept by a junior clerk in the office—entries are made in it of all orders and payments of money into Court—if the order had been brought to the Accountant-General s office and acted upon it would have appeared in the direction-book—I should have seen the direction from the Bank but not the order—the second clerk in the office would have seen that and would have drawn the direction—it would be my duty to examine both very minutely together to see that they are alike I mean the Accountant-General s certificate and the Bank certificate before he signs it—on my laying it before him he signs it—the order could not have passed the Accountant-General so as to get the money into the Bank without my being cognizant of it—it could not have been acted upon without my having seen it—if the money had been paid I should have seen it after it had been paid—there must as a matter of course have been an entry in the direction-book before the certificate is carried to the Bank—the direction-book is one of the public books of the office—I have examined that direction-book minutely from the date of the order to the time of the prisoner s committal—I have no recollection of any circumstance relating to the payment of this sum of 2596l 17s into the Bank but it could not possibly have been paid under that order—it must have been in three separate certificates—it is quite impossible that under such an order there could have been such a certificate as this purports to be a copy of—we could not have told the amount without an affidavit and there is no affidavit there—the original affidavit would be filed in the Affidavit-office and we take the office-copy—I have not searched at the Affidavit-office—the solicitor would take the office-copy away with him with the order Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q What are the letters on that mark which you say purports to be the stamp of the Report-office A I really cannot read it—it is very different now to what it was when I first saw it—there is not a single letter distinctly visible—I think the stamp of the Report-office is as plain as can be—none of the documents are filed in our office—when the sums are to be paid in separately there is a separate certificate from the Accountantgeneral—if one sum has interest to be calculated on it that is to be ascer tained by affidavit—the interest must be ascertained up to the time of payment and they swear the interest two or three days beyond the affidavit so as to give them that time to pay the money in—the certificate certifies that the money has been paid in to the account mentioned in the order—they are both signed by the Accountant-General—we call it a certificate and a direction both—the certificate to pay in is an entirely separate document to the certificate that it has been paid in—one is sighed by the Accountant-General and the other by a cashier of the Bank—they are both in the same certificate—they are distinct documents—they are both annexed to the receipt and filed at the Report-office—I have nothing to do with the Report-office—the Accountant-General s office closed about the 17th or 18th of Aug not so early as the 10th—a direction to pay in money would have been attended to up to the very day of closing—there is generally a great rush of people before the office closes—a great number of orders are brought in for the payment of costs which keeps the clerks employed—the office does not open again till about the 2nd of Nov the first day of term—if the interest is calculated short of the day of payment we could not take the money—the Bank would not take it—the Accountant-General s direction is to pay in on or before up to the date—there is no order that all sums paid to the Accountant-General should be paid in cash and not by check—not one-tenth part of the railroad money has been paid in cash MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You say the certificate signed by the Accountant-General of the money having been paid in is one document and the receipt from the Bank another A Certainly—they are wafered together and deposited in the Report-office—the office copies are made both from the certificate and the receipt in one document on one sheet of paper—it is one copy of the two documents JOHN REID I am in the office of the Clerk of Accounts This paper purports to be an office copy of the certificate of the Accountant-General and of the receipt of a cashier of the Bank—it being dated 25th June the original would be filed in the office of accounts of the Report-office the following day and at that time it would have been brought to me personally by a clerk of the Accountant-General—if it had been genuine but it is a forgery I should have examined it and had it entered by a junior clerk in the journal of that division and then I should myself have examined it with that journal—it would then be handed down to the Report-office to make an office copy—it would then come back to me and remain in my custody twelve months—it would have been in my custody from June till now—I have no such paper in my custody corresponding with this Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q How do you ascertain that A Because I have examined them from the 23rd of May up to the end of Trinity term and from that time onwards till the prisoner s apprehension and there is no such document—I have examined the documents in the Report-office—they are done up in bundles and arranged according to the return—I have searched those bundles since the 22nd of June—the Account-office is a branch of the Report-office—I am a clerk in the office of accounts—that has been established from the time the Accountant-General s Office was established in 1726—there are four divisions and three clerks in each division—William Lambert is the senior clerk—he is called the chief clerk of accounts—the clerk of reports is John Reid my father—he has held that situation from eight to ten years—he performs a great part of that duty himself—he is not able to perform the whole of it—he performed part of it in June and July but was assisted by a younger son—he was at the office every day never omitting one day—the original certificate would be deposited in the Accountoffice not in the Report-office—they are afterwards filed in the office of accounts and after that they become records—I have nothing to do with the office copies in my official capacity—I made the search among the files of certificates the day before I went to Bow-street—they are kept in my custody—I should say I looked over from 3000 to 4000—no one assisted me—I was engaged upon it about five hours—they are not folded but lying open—I turned over each one separately and read the titles of them—I mean to say distinctly on my oath that between June and Feb no money whatever was placed to that account not on account of the trustees in the matter of Edward Frank a lunatic on the account named in the order—the heading of each particular account would give me that information—the heading of this account would be In the matter of the Rev Edward Frank a person of unsound mind —I am quite certain there was no account of the sort—I could not find anything by the name of Frank—I looked at every part where it ought to have been in the book and examined the whole of the others—I examined under the initial of the letter F and moreover had it been paid in and not been in our book we should not have agreed on our annual balance with the Accountant-General—there were not 4000 or 5000 of the letter F but I looked under every certificate that had been filed in the office from the first day of Trinity term till the day the prisoner was apprehended and that included not only those of the letter F but every letter in the division from D to I in which it could have been filed MR BODKIN Q Assuming there had been a genuine document corresponding with that could it possibly have been filed in any other division than that which you have searched A Certainly not FREDERICK REID I am the brother of the last witness and am a clerk in the Report-office of the Court of Chancery—my father John Reid is the senior clerk in that office—I am a clerk under him—he filled that office in June last and was attending there regularly during that month—the certificates of the Accountant-General with the Bank receipts annexed are brought into our office to have office copies made of them—this document is in the form of an office copy but it is not a genuine document because office copies are made with twenty-six lines in a page and seven words in a line except the title and The Governor and Co is four words in a line in a genuine document—the fee here marked 2s 4d is not the proper fee—it would be 3s 10d —it is according to the number of folios—there is something here resembling the mark of a stamp—it is not made by our office stamp—there is a slight resemblance and it looks near upon the same size—it was clearer when I saw it before—I never saw the words Report-office on it—there was a faint appearance of the word office when I first saw it but I could not see the word Report —this is a genuine stamp looking at one —it is not on the same part of the paper—this is lower down—I should certainly say it is a forged and counterfeit document Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Who stamps them A Myself generally sometimes my father with a hand-stamp—the office copies are not always made by the clerks in the office because it would be impossible to do all the work of the office—the work is sent out not to law writers but to persons whom we know whom my father employs—they take them home to do—the solicitors clerks never copy them—I never knew an instance of it not of Accountant-General s certificates—they are not sometimes copied by mere children—they certainly have been copied by women who write a very good hand but they are parts of the families of the clerks in the office and by no one else—they are corrected with the original documents—they are persons whom we know who would copy them accurately—we never send them to any but the families of clerks in the office—there is one other person—I have beeen acting for my father ever since he has been there—I should say there have not been hundreds of instances in which Accountant-General s certificates have been copied by persons unconnected with the clerks families—they are given out by myself to the head writer and then divided among the other writers to each their portion—Accountant-General s certificates are always copied by the clerks because we are particular about them—their families may do it if there is not sufficient other work—it is confined to their families—it is not left to the clerks to copy them themselves or to employ others—I should soon detect that—they are given out to the clerks in numbers and taken away—they must be copied properly and they are hands that work for us all along—I know the hand-writing of all the persons sanctioned by us—I believe there are ten persons employed to copy certificates five in the office and five out—I know their hand-writing—they all pass before me—there is Mr M Keen and his son Mr Sheen Mr Adcock and Mr Hatton in our office—my brother two daughters of Mr M Keen and two daughters of Mr Sheen out of the office—those are all that I am aware of—they always come back in the same hand-writing—if I saw a different hand I should inquire whose it was—I believe we always keep to the same number of words in a line as near as possible—it would be impossible to do so always—there is a rule in the office that office copies are to be made in a general form and I believe it is generally attended to but it would be impossible to count every certificate that comes in—the object is to regulate the payment according to the number of folios—if I were to see anything wrong I should make them copy it over again MR WADDINGTON Q These are sent out by your father s orders to these different people to copy A They are—the writers examine them with the originals before they are given up to me—they are compared with the originals to see if they are correct when or before they are brought back it is the duty of the writer to examine them—they are paid a halfpenny a folio for doing so—I then mark the fee upon them and put on the stamp COURT Q Do you mark the fee on all the office copies A Sometimes they are marked by the writers if they are certain about the date but still it comes to me to see whether it is right or wrong—either myself or my father always put on the stamp—I act as my father s deputy—the originals are kept in the office of accounts twelve months—they are then arranged and labelled and brought to our office and there they remain—we make office copies of them if required—ours is the proper office in which they are ultimately deposited SAMUEL GEORGE SMYTH I am a clerk in the Chancery Office of the Bank of England—it is part of my duty to receive and pay money according to the directions of the Accountant-General—on the production of a form similar to the first part of this document I should receive monies presented at the office—when a party comes to pay money in at the Bank he hands this direction to the clerk with the money—the direction is preserved in our office—when the money has been paid a receipt is handed to the person paying it in—he takes it to the cashier to be signed—the entering clerk also signs the receipt—an entry of the payment is made in the cash-book in many instances by the clerk who receives it but not always—a duplicate is made out of all the payments made into the office during the day and sent to the Accountant-General a duplicate of the cash-book with each item—that is sent by a messenger to the Accountant-General s office the same afternoon—after the cash-book leaves the office to which I belong it is posted into the ledger next morning—this document purports to be a copy of a Bank receipt—the name of the entering clerk is F H Ward and the name of the cashier W R West—there was no cashier of that name in June last nor any such entering clerk as F H Ward—I have the cash-book kept in our office of 25th June last—I made the entries on that day—there is no entry of any sum of 2596l 17s to the account of the Rev Edward Frank a person of unsound mind—I have searched further beyond that day to see if there is any such entry—there are five books each cash-book does not work the same day—this is No 5 and there are cash books numbered from 1 to 5 consequently on the morrow the 26th No I would be in work—I have searched all those books and find no such payment—if it had been paid on the 25th of June it must have appeared in this particular cash book—the entry is always made the same day and about half an hour or an hour after the receipt of the money—the directions which are brought are filed in our office—they are passed to the Ledger-office the day after they are brought about nine o clock in the morning and are returned usually about eleven or twelve o clock—I have searched the files and there is no such direction as this Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q I believe it is the practice of the Accountant-General s office only to receive cash in payment A Only cash—a check would not be received as payment under the Accountant-General s certificate—it would not be received if it was a check from anybody who had an account with the Bank because the drawing accounts are kept in the Drawingoffice and the clerks in the Chancery-office have no means of knowing whether there is cash for such accounts but a check from the Drawing-office would be received—there can be no such thing as a private check of the Accountant-General—it would be a Drawing-office check JOSEPH BOARDMAN I am a clerk in the Exchequer-office of the Bank of England—I keep the ledger—it would be part of my duty to enter into the ledger the sums paid into the account of the Accountant-General—the letter F would be in my department—I have carefully examined the ledger—I have a copy of the account in question relating to the Rev Edward Frank—I have carefully examined it with the book—I got it from the ledger that is under my charge— the check was here read MR SMYTH re-examined We should not receive a crossed check at the Accountant-General s office—we require the money—it is the universal practice to pay money in MR PARKINSON re-examined I have now got the direction-book—I have searched it carefully from the 4th of Nov 1844 up to the present time nearly—I find do entry of any direction or certificate relating to this sum of 2596l 17s Jonathan Wagstaff Bryant Esq Clement s-inn Rev Edward Manners Goldby-hall

t18460330-965  965 WILLIAM CHAFEY was indicted for feloniously forging and uttering on the 10th of Feb an acquittance and receipt for the payment of 1l 1s with intent to defraud John Reeves MR ROBINSON conducted the Prosecution CHARLES CHANTRT I am secretary to the Royal Jennerian Institution and reside in Orchard-street Hackney—I have known the prisoner for many years—he was our collector up to the 12th of Dec 1844—he was then discharged and Mr David Hine succeeded him—it had been his duty as collector to receive subscriptions and to endeavour to obtain new subscribers—our institution is for the purpose of distributing vaccine matter and to vaccinate all who apply to the institution—we had a set of regular subscribers—the prisoner would have a report in his possession containing their names—he was paid a per centage on his collections formerly and 12s a week as all his time was occupied but latterly he was only engaged in collecting—he had no authority to receive subscriptions since Dec 1844—Mr Reeves has been a subscriber of ours for many years—no subscription of his has been paid to me by the prisoner since Dec 1844 —I received none in Feb 1846—this card looking at one affixed to the receipt is not a card authorized by the institution and this receipt is not one authorized by us it is quite a different form—I produce one of the forms we use and which the prisoner was in the habit of using when he was collector—I know Mr Hine s signature—I do not believe the signature to this receipt to be his—I know the prisoner s writing and I believe the body of this receipt to be his handwriting—I cannot swear to the signature being his Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How long have you been the secretary A Between seven and eight years—the prisoner was collector for upwards of twenty years—the institution is conducted by a board of managers consisting of twelve—one of them has a rope wharf—he is not a ropemaker—one is a chemist and one a tailor and Dr Epps is one—we have two stations for vaccination—there is another institution a government one—we have never represented ours as the government institution nor pretended that we had a great many stations for the purpose of getting money—I never heard of such a thing and do not believe it—I was a schoolmaster at Watford before I became secretary to this institution—I left there twenty-three years ago—I have since then held another situation for twenty-two years as school-master at Hackney—I understand that the prisoner was thrown out of a gig while he was in the service of the society—he is crippled—I do not know whether his lameness proceeded from that circumstance or another—after he was discharged he stated that a sum of 41l was owing to him—I have not seen him since his dismissal—he sent in an account for 41l by his wife—I never heard him say that as I would not pay him what was owing to him he would collect the subscriptions and pay himself—I swear I did not hear him say so—I believe he was a very active collector and that he advanced the interests of the institution as far as laid in his power—his brother is a life governor—the prisoner is brother to Mr Chafey the auctioneer at Brighton—I do not know of his getting 500l from a lady of title—500l was bequeathed to the society by a Mrs Wakefield but I do not know that the prisoner was instrumental in that—it came through another medium—we had sent out letters to the subscribers stating the prisoner s dismissal Q Did not you know that be meant to collect before you sent out those letters A We might suppose that he would do such a thing but we could not know he meant to do it—I did not know it—it is usual to send out letters to apprize the subscribers of the change in the collector—we only stated that from irregularities in our former collector we had dismissed him and begged the subscribers not to pay him—this is the letter that was put out MR ROBINSON Q Had the prisoner any connection with the 500l A No—the lady subscribed previous to that and he received her subscription but the 500l was a legacy and came through Mr Trimmer—the national institution does not bear our name—it is called the National Vaccine Institution and is supported by government—this receipt does not bear the name of that institution it bears the name of our institution—his commission on the 500l was the chief item he claimed but the amount he claims for legacies from the commencement of the institution amounts to considerably more—he claims a commission on a legacy of 25l of Mr De Rosa which was left fifteen years previously—I do not know of his making any claim on that account before he left—the 500l was left about 1838 or 1839—the prisoner left in Dec 1844—no claim was made with regard to that 500l or any part of the 41l previous to that time—when he was dismissed he was a defaulter—he acknowledged having received several sums—he deducted those from what he said was due to him leaving a balance of 41l —that was after he was dismissed JOHN REEVES I reside at Clapham—I have been for many years a regular subscriber to this institution—on the 10th of Feb the prisoner called at my house about a quarter-past three in the afternoon—he sent in a card similar to this—I went out to him in the hall and asked him if he had a receipt—he produced one signed the name of Hine I gave him a sovereign and 1s and he left the house—within a quarter of an hour after he was gone Mr Hine the regular collector called and I said I had just paid the money—I believe this is the receipt the prisoner gave me Cross-examined Q How long have you been a subscriber A About seven years—I had paid the prisoner several times before—I had received a circular from the office not to pay the prisoner but I did not recognize him at the moment as he had sent in the card with Mr Hine s name on it—I was at dinner at the time DAVID HINE I am the present collector to this institution—on the 10th of Feb I called at the house of Mr Reeves—he told me he had paid the money and gave me this card and receipt—this is not a card which I am in the habit of carrying—I know nothing about it—this D Hine on it is a forgery and the D Hine on the receipt is a forgery—it is not mine—I did not authorise anybody to sign it—I have been the collector for a year and a quarter Cross-examined Q Do you know the prisoner A No—I never saw him till he was in custody—I was not at all acquainted with the institution before I was collector to it—I was never instructed to clash our institution with the government institution in order to get subscriptions—my business is only to collect MR ROBINSON Q Do you know anything of the other institution A Nothing—there is no Mr D Hine collector to that institution that I know of—I know of no D Hine but myself JEREMIAH LOCKERBY police-constable S 180 From a description I had of the prisoner I apprehended him on Wednesday the 4th of Feb —I asked if his name was Chaffey—he said no it was not and asked why I asked him such a question—I told him I was a policeman and that I apprehended him on suspicion of forgery—he said he had committed no forgery—I asked him if he had ever been a collector to an institution—he said no he had not—I felt convinced that he was the man and I took him to the station—he then gave me this document and said I suppose this is what you mean the Vaccine Institution I am an innocent man they owe me 41l and I will let the public know it —I searched the prisoner and took two other papers from him—I found some receipts—I also searched his lodgings and found this receipt-book some papers and a quantity of books—these are the same sort of forms of receipts as the one in question—I asked him if be lived at No 41 Clarendon-square—he said he did not—he afterwards admitted that he did live there Cross-examined Q It was fifty-one was it not A Yes—he handed me this paper marked A at the station-house and said I suppose this is what you mean the London Vaccine Institution this will prove they owe me 41l —he also gave me this paper marked B—I kept all the papers I found upon him—he said he would let the public know he was an innocent man—two more constables were present when I searched his lodgings and his wife—he was not there—he was at the station-house COURT Q What is the name of the person that keeps the house A I do not know—the landlady told me the part he lived in and the wife also Receipt read— Royal Jennerian and London Vaccine Institution Received this 10th of Feb 1846 of John Reeves Esq the sum of one guinea being a subscription for the year 1846 D HINE collector —The paper marked A was an account of commissions on various sums with deductions leaving a balance of 41l 0s 6d —the paper marked B was as follows We understand that a regular hoax is attempted to be carried into effect in this and other countries by a company pretending to invest individuals not of the faculty with a diploma for promoting vaccination deputing an agent to collect subscriptions for what purpose is best known to themselves and to receive 12s 6d for the grant of each diploma not recognised by Dr Jenner not patronised by government or the Royal College of Surgeons —upon the card was I Hine collector to the Royal Jennerian and London Vaccine Institution MR CHANTRY re-examined Mr John Henry is one of the managers of the Institution—there are twelve on the board JEREMIAH LOCKERBY re-examined I have not kept back any papers that I found upon the prisoner—they are all in court—I have two newspapers that I took from him—he said there was an advertisement in them containing some remarks against him by the company GUILTY Aged 40 — Transported for Ten Years

along she gave me a description—she said it was a tall man with a black frock coat on with sandy hair and whiskers and hair on the upper lip—she did not say what she was to meet him for—we went to Charing Cross and then to the fountains in Trafalgar-square—she said that was where she was to find him if she did not meet him on the road—we went to the fountains—there was no man there answering

the best of my belief this check ii written by him Cross-examined Q I believe your ladyship never saw the person who signed himself Pearce A Not to my knowledge—I have had no personal communication

missed Sullivan from the house after that—I cannot say when it was but I noticed repeated knocks at the door—I met Pearce and told him I wanted to come in to look at the ceilings—he said Mrs Pearce

is a relative of mine—I corresponded with him about a year ago and have done so five or six years—it is only till very lately that I have had correspondence with him—it ii two or three years ago I cannot distinctly recollect how long hot not within a year I have seen him write—I have a memorandum here signed by him on the 7th 17th and 25th of Aug 1843—I saw him write on all those days—these are the documents he wrote be name to—I do not recollect seeing him write anything but his name - - BELL I am a reporter and live in Southwark Bridge-road I am acquainted with Pearce and his writing and believe this check to be his writing—three years ago he was an occasional contributor to various newspapers—I had attended public inquiries for five or seven years previously and have had occasion to see him write 150 times—the last time was about four years ago—previous to that I was in the habit of seeing him write pretty constantly—to the best of my belief this letter marked A is his writing—I believe these also to be his writing— looking at some others Cross-examined Q Had you and the prisoner any difference at any time A Never—it is four or five years since I saw him write or act as a reporter—I believe he has not been reporting since that—we were occasionally in the habit of reading each others reports THOMAS JOHN GREEN I am a newspaper reporter and have known Pearce several years as a reporter I know his handwriting and believe this check and this letter marked A to be his also—I also believe these other letters to be his Cross-examined Q How long is it since you have seen him write A I think about three years—I was not very intimate with him but frequently saw him write and his copy frequently passed through my hands THOMAS WATSON I am a manifold paper-maker I have known the prisoner seventeen or eighteen years—I have frequently seen him write—I believe this check to be his writing—this letter A is his style of writing—I believe it to be his and these other letters as well Cross-examined Q You seem to express a doubt about the letter A I discover a difference in it which creates a doubt—it is a broader writing—he did not generally write so broad a hand—I recollect his writing perfectly well—the check is in his ordinary writing but the letter is broader—the letters are wider altogether—his handwriting is generally close—the words are stretched out—they are larger than his general writing— letter A read— Coton-house 25th of Aug 1846 Mrs Wallace I received your letter and now send you a check on Messrs Coutts and Co for 152 you will let me know by letter

George Edwards and Sarah his wife with intent to defraud the Governor and Company of the Bank of England —Other COUNTS varying the manner of stating the charge MR CLARKSON with SIR JOHN BAILEY conducted the Prosecution ABEL CLIFTON I am one of the principal clerks in the Long Annuity Transfer-office at the Bank of England I produce the ledger and transfer-book in which is an entry of stock standing in the name of George Edwards and Sarah his wife— reads George Edwards and Sarah his wife of Ebury-street Pimlico 3l 10s per annum —that was standing in those names on the 5th of Jan 1842—it is stock which is transferable at the Bank of England—this is the entry in the transfer-book— read I George Edwards of Ebury-street Pimlico gentleman this 5th day of Jan 1842 do assign and transfer 3l 10s standing in the name of myself and Sarah my wife being all our joint interest in the said stock &c to Clement Smith of the Stock Exchange his executors &c —Witness my name—GEORGE EDWARDS—Witness to the identity of George Edwards Thomas Compton —these initials S S L in the book were placed there after the transfer was made Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Here is 1660 and 853 that is put after it is done is it not A It is entered at the time—it is merely a reference to the ledger and no part of the transfer—the figures are put at the time of the transfer—the Initials are put afterwards—the transfer is entered before he signs it—this 2276 was entered afterwards—it is generally done after the transfer is signed—this Entered by A Clifton is done before he signs it—all is done previous to the signature except the No 2276 and the initials— S S Lowe is the attestation and is written by the witness to the execution immediately after he signs it—here is a form for accepting the stock at the bottom—that is for the person purchasing the stock to sign it or not as he pleases—brokers do not sign it SIR JOHN BAILEY Q Is Clement Smith the purchaser of that stock a stock-broker A He is a stock-jobber—the stock was transferred to Edwards and his wife on the 6th of April 1840—it was purchased in their names that day SAMUEL STEPHENSON LOW On the 5th of Jan 1842 I was clerk in the Long Annuity Transfer-office—I am the attesting witness to the signature of George Edwards in this transfer—I witness a great many transfers and hate no recollection of the party making the transfer GEORGE EDWARDS I am a retired coachman—I have lived in Ebury-street Pimlico six years and a half—I am married—my wife s maiden name was Sarah Swift—we were married in 1883—after we were married my wife lived in the service of Mr Handley of Newark—before that she lived with a gentleman named Mowbert—she left there five years ago or more but I am no scholar—at that time I was living in Ebury-street—between her leaving Mr Mowbert s and going to Mr Handley s she came to my lodging in Ebury-street and went from me to Mr Handley s—at that time I had a gold watch and other things—I had saved a little money and she had saved some too—I let her have my watch money and other things—I left her to do as she liked with them—I had some money in the long annuities—I always gave my savings to my wife to take care of—she is alive—I have not had a letter from her for three years—her Christian name is Sarah—the money that I gave her in 1840 she put into the bank before she went into the country—I left it to her where she was to put it—she said she would go and put it into the bank—I left it to her to dispose of as she thought beat—I remember her coming home when she had been out for the purpose—she showed me a paper and put it into a box—I cannot say what year it was in as I am no scholar—I did not accompany her to the bank or any where—this George Edwards in the bank book is not my writing—I did not authorize anybody to sign my name to any transfer or sale of the stock—I never gave the prisoner or my wife or anybody authority to sell it—I did not know it had been sold till I had a communication from my daughter lately—this letter looking at letter A is not my writing nor any part of it—I did not authorize anybody to make a demand on the bank to sell this money without the attendance of my wife or authorize my wife to send the prisoner or anybody else to do it—I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge till I saw him in custody—until these proceedings were instituted I did not know that my wife had left Mr Handley s service—this letter looking at one is from my wife I received it by post I do not know when—I cannot read but it is her writing to the best of my knowledge—in consequence of something that I heard I came up to London—I have not seen my watch since I first heard something about it about September last—I knew nothing about the stock being transferred until I made inquiry about my watch Cross-examined Q You cannot write I understand A I can write my name but not such writing as this—I can write nothing but my name—I can read my name when it is written—I can read my wife s letters if they are very plain—when she did not write plain I did not attempt to make them out—I got a friend to read them for me—all the letters I received were generally read by some other person—this money was not almost all my wife s savings—she had a little but not a great deal—she had my money as well—I never kept an account of the money—I was always giving her money but never asked what she had about her and knew nothing about it—she always took the money of me—we lived on very good terms—I lived with her four years regularly two years at Leamington just after we were married—she then went out cooking and came to me at night—after that we came to London and lived there together for two years—we were always on very good terms—I last heard from her three years ago at Newark—I have had a letter from her since—she said she had left Mr Handley and went abroad—I saw her at Newark for three days—it must be more than half a year since I had seen her before that—I am now living at Coventry—I have lived there five years next Christmas—I left Ebury-street five years ago next Christmas—I lived there for six years and a half before that—I never went to the bank—I let my wife have the money to put in the bank with whatever little she had of her own the same as I had trusted my former wife—I gave it to her to put into the bank—I am quite sure of that—she said she was going to put the money into the bank and I said put it all together—I did not tell her to take care of it in any way she liked but to put it in the bank—I don t know the amount of it—she has had 15l and 10l at a time—she had no money of her own in the bank at that time—what is hers is mine and what is mine is hers—I don t think she had any money of her own in the bank before she put this in—I don t know that she had any money at all when we married—I had a little annuity coming to me and when I got it I always gave it her—I generally paid her 2l at a time just as I got it—I gave her 10l and 15l at two different times MR CLARKSON Q Were you living in Ebury-street Pimlico when you had the conversation with her about going to the bank A Yes I left Ebury-street to go and live at Coventry five years ago next Christmas—we went into business after we married but she did not like it—she then went into service—she went out to cook for a month or two and did not go into regular service till we came to London which was two years after we married—there was no quarrel between us—we were the best of friends—when I gave her the money to put in the bank I did not give her authority to sell it out without my knowledge THOMAS CROMPTON I am a stock-broker and in January 1842 carried on business in Lothbury Mr Alfred Bailey a stock-broker had an office on the same floor—I was in the habit of transacting business for him in his absence—I have acted for him many times—In Jan 1842 his clerk Godin applied to me and I went into Mr Bailey s room where I found a person who I understood to be Mr Edwards—I cannot be certain but I fancy the prisoner to be the same person—I believe him to be so but it is a long time ago—I cannot speak positively—I never saw him before or since till this evening—he wanted to sell 3l 10s long annuities by the request of his wife as the stock stood in their joint names—this paper A was produced to me—I said that was not sufficient authority to do the business without the wife it was out of the usual course to sell stock standing in the name of the wife—both are required by the bank to be present or a power of attorney procured—I stated that to the person—the man said he had come from the country expressly for the purpose and brought this which he conceived sufficient authority to enable him to sell the stock without the presence of his wife it was not convenient for her to come and he thought the authority sufficient—I said it could not be done and if there was any urgency about it he had better make application elsewhere—I believe I took him with me to Mr Smee the chief accountant at the Bank to know if this was sufficient authority but I may have gone alone—I saw Mr Smee who said Let him write a request to make the transfer without his wife —the person attended at the Bank and wrote this request himself on the back of the paper A —I attended at the Bank the same day and sold the stock on account of the person who wrote that request— looking at the transfer I identified the person making this transfer as George Edwards—I took him to be George Edwards on the representation of the young man Mr Bailey s clerk who was under age and the Bank would not allow him to identify—I presumed the young man knew him—the stock was sold to Clement Smith stock-broker and jobber—I received the purchase-money from him which I believe was 43l 15s and which I paid the person I identified and who I understood to be George Edwards—I gave Bailey the commission and rendered him an account of it Cross-examined Q I believe you have some doubt of the identity of the prisoner A It is so long ago and not having seen him before I cannot say he is the man—to the best of my recollection he is—it was a person resembling the prisoner—I really think it was him—the transaction did not occupy two hours—he might have been away an hour of that time—there is no doubt on my mind as far as I recollect that the prisoner is the person—I was shown the real George Edwards and was quite certain he was not the person I identified—I can almost fancy I have seen Edwards before—I am in the habit of seeing a great many people—it is impossible to recollect—it is difficult to distinguish on what particular occasion I have seen a particular person SIR JOHN BAILEY Q Do you recollect going to the Compter in Sept or Oct last A Yes—I was shown eight or nine persons all together—I pointed out the prisoner from among them CARLTON ANTHONY GODIN I am a private in the 31st regiment of foot and have been so seventeen weeks I was formerly clerk to Mr Bailey a stock-broker of Lothbury for two years and two months—I am twenty years old—I was in Mr Bailey s employ in Jan 1842—he is occasionally out of town—Mr Crompton was in the same business and lived on the same floor as Mr Bailey—when Mr Bailey was out of town Mr Bullock transacted the business and when both were out of town Mr Crompton acted for him—I remember a person coming in Jan 1842 to effect a transfer of some stock—to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man—he came to the office when I was there by myself and said he wanted to know whether he could sell some stock without bringing his wife there—that is a very Unusual occurrence when stock stands in the name of man and wife—he produced this note purporting to be from his wife—I am not aware that he told me what the stock was—I read the paper myself—I cannot tell whether he produced a stock receipt—I do not know that he told me why his wife was absent—I fetched Mr Crompton who came into Mr Bailey s room—this paper was lying on the table—I am sure this is the paper—I believe I looked at it while he was conversing with Mr Crompton—he told Mr Crompton he came from the country and was rather urgent about having the stock sold—he said his wife could not come from the country either from indisposition or being in employment I am not certain which—he showed the paper to Mr Crompton—I relieve Mr Crompton said he did not think it could be allowed without laving a power of attorney to do it—at the same time Mr Crompton said he would take him over to Mr Smee the chief accountant—he took him there—I did not go with them—they may have been absent half an hour—I do not think they returned together—the same person came back again to stay till it was finished—it is necessary for the stock-broker to go to different places to sell the stock and in the mean time the man remained at the office with me—I do not suppose he was there more than three-quarters of an hour after that—Mr Crompton returned before the three-quarters of an hour—they went over to the Bank together to finish the transaction but not directly—I do not recollect that they returned after they came from the Bank—I had an opportunity of seeing the man for three-quarters of an hour—the transaction was very peculiar which induced me to take notice of it—I noticed the paper—I noticed the man coming and I thought a great deal of it altogether on account of its being unusual—I did not see the prisoner again till last Thursday week in custody in Newgate—I instantly recognised him—he was shown to me among others—I had a recollection of him before he was shown to me—there was a curious look about his eyes that I noticed and I recollected his having whiskers and he was rather a tall man by the side of me—the prisoner is dressed differently now but looking at his features I have no doubt in my own mind of his being the man—I have no particular doubt but I will not swear as if I had seen him a week ago but on my oath I do believe him to be the person Cross-examined Q He is dressed differently now A Yes—he did not seem dressed quite so respectably as he is now—I have no particular doubt of his being the man but will not swear to him as if it had only happened a week ago—I believe it to be him MR CLARKSON Q Have you gone into the army in consequence of misconduct or was it your own inclination A It was my own inclination—I always wished it CHARLOTTE ARNOLD I am the wife of Robert Arnold a cabinet-maker at Newark I know the prisoner—I was acquainted with him first about five years ago for about a year and a half—I knew him by the name of Henry Barratt—I have seen him write many times—the name George Edwards in this transfer is very much like his writing—this request to the chief accounttant is in his writing and the whole of this note A except the signature is very much like his writing but I am positive the other side is— this was the request to act both being on the same paper Cross-examined Q Which do you say is not his writing A The signature to the letter and this Allowed by the deputy-governor W Smee —I say both the papers are his writing—I said this side was like his writing—it is his writing but he was agitated when he wrote it I can see that—I have not a doubt about this part—on the other side all except Allowed &c is his writing COURT Q What opportunities had you of seeing him write A I lived in the same service with him very nearly a year and a half and knew him a year besides that JAMBS HUNTER I live in Bloomsbury-street—in 1828 I with others set on foot a society called the Royal Standard Benefit Society—in Nov 1835 the prisoner joined the society in the name of Henry Hitchcock Barratt and continued a member till Jan 1842 when he was excluded for non-payment—while he was a member I had communications from him and have seen him write on other matters not connected with the benefit society—I believe this letter A except the signature S Edwards to be his writing—this demand to act on the other side of the paper decidedly is—it is still more apparent—the signature and the whole of it except the memorandum at the bottom is his Cross-examined Q Have you ever seen him write A Not often—I have no doubt of its being his—I have had communications from him some times and acted on them—I have seen him write in connection with a loan society of which he is unfortunately a borrower—I will not positively swear it is his writing but I believe it is his decidedly—I have no doubt of it whatever MR CLARKSON Look at the signature George Edwards in the transfer-book A I believe it to be his writing SAMUEL COULDREY I am a gold-beater and live in Eccleston-street—I know George Edwards and his wife—I have known Mrs Edwards for the last twenty years—her maiden name was Sarah Swift—I have known Edwards since he has been married which was in 1840—my father is a builder—I remember Mrs Edwards coming to my father in the spring of 1840—I do not recollect what month it was—I believe my father went somewhere with her—I knew her when she was cook to Mr Handley—she went there as cook it may be a week or a month after she came to my father—I was then living at Eccleston-street East Pimlico—in Jan 1842 the prisoner called on my father—he told me he was butler to Mr Handley of Newark and had come to bring Mrs Edwards compliments to Mr Couldrey my father—my father is laid up and has lost his sight—the last time I saw Mrs Edwards was on the apprehendsion of the prisoner on the 19th of Sept at Greenwich—the prisoner was with her—they represented themselves then to be Mr and Mrs Jones—the prisoner gave his name Joseph Jones—in April 1845 I saw Mrs Edwards went with her to the bank and took her to Mr Peppercorn a stock-broker to purchase some stock—in consequence of what passed between us Mrs Edwards gave a description of a person to the Bank porter in my presence in consequence of which I went to Mr Bailey s office in Lothbury—I communicated what I heard there to Mrs Edwards and she immediately left the neighbourhood—she left on the Monday following to go to Newark—I saw her off by the train—on the 4th or 5th of Aug this year I saw her again at my house—the prisoner came with her—it was not the first time I had seen him but the first time I had seen them together—she introduced him to me as her husband Joseph Jones—I recognized him as the man who represented himself as Mr Handley s butler three or four years back and came with Mr Handley s compliments—I said Why you are Barratt —he said No my name is Jones I am not Barratt —Mrs Edwards replied This is my husband his name is Joseph Jones —that was all that occurred at the time—I went to Norwood next day—I saw a gold watch in the prisoner s possession last Aug and recognized it as belonging to George Edwards—in consequence of suspicion after Mrs Edwards told me in the prisoner s presence that her husband was dead I made a communication to George Edwards s daughter—Mrs Edwards had told me in the prisoner s presence that her husband had been dead two years and pointing to her finger with a ring on it she said This la the only man that put that on —I afterwards accompanied them to Norwood and Greenwich to look for a beer-shop—in the course of that day Mrs Edwards addressed him by no other name than Jones—sometimes she addressed him as B not Mr B —she merely used the letter B —I did not know what that meant—that was besides Jones or Joseph—I have seen the prisoner write seldom but enough to form a judgment—I received a letter from him on the 28th of Aug this year and acted on it—this signature George Edwards to this transfer corresponds with the writing of the letter I received—to the best of my belief I believe the letter produced A to be his writing except the signature and should say the demand to act on the other side is his The transfer of the stock was here read also the following document A 31st Dec 1841 I authorize George Edwards my husband to receive the amount of stock and interest to the date of such stock being removed I am yours respectfully SARAH EDWARDS On the back of which was I request to sell the amount of 3l 10s long annuities standing in the name of myself and wife without the signature of my wife—GEORGE EDWARDS 5th January 1842 To W Smee Esq MR PRENDERGAST to MR COULDREY Q You have known Mrs Edwards some considerable time A I have and she was living with her husband previous to going to service at Mr Mowbert s in 1835—I knew her living with her husband some time—I visited them when they lived together and was on intimate terms with them—I was surprised to hear of Mr Edwards s death last Aug —I had not seen him for four or five years MR CLARKBON Q Was it in consequence of hearing he was dead and seeing his gold watch in another man s hands that you went to the daughter to make inquiry A Yes—I had no reason to suppose they had ever separated or quarrelled GUILTY Transported for Life 
t18470104-348  348 JOHN HATTON was indicted for feloniously uttering a forged warrant for the delivery of 25 pints of wine with intent to defraud the London Dock Company —other COUNTS varying the manner of laying the charge MR BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution JESSE ELSTON I am a porter and am in the habit of standing at the gates of the London Docks—I know the prisoner On 28th Nov about three o clock I saw him at the Dock-gates—I went with him as far as Maxwell s the Phœnix public-house—I went by this direction to the Dock-Coffee-house and fetched a half-dozen basket containing half-a-dozen wine-bottles—I did not deliver them to the prisoner I kept them myself—I met him again at the Phœnix public-house and he gave me a one dozen basket and this order No 4—he told me to go as I did on the 26th and sample the wine—he said if the cooper asked me any questions I was not to answer him but was to say I came from Dingwell and Co —I went to the proper office at the East-vault London Docks and got the samples of wine—as I was coming away I was spoken to by Clements the officer—I made a communication to him—I was to meet the prisoner at the crescent vault and if I did not meet him there I was to go on to the Dock Coffee-house—I did not go there with Clements as he took me to the Guard-house so that there was some delay—I had never seen the prisoner before I saw him at the Dock-gate on the 26th Nov he then wanted me to go with him to fetch a basket and some bottles and then to go and sample some wine—he then gave me order No 3—I took in into the London Docks obtained eighteen samples pints of wine for it and took them to the Phœnix—the prisoner was with me I left them in the bar by his desire and left him there Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Do you hang about the Docks A Yes—I do not know a man named Dunks—I never heard the name till the prisoner mentioned it at the guard-house—he said I must know Dunks that he had a white waistcoat on at the Phœnix—I said I should not know him—I did see am man there I did not take particular notice if his waistcoat—I have not seen him in the Docks since the prisoner has been in custody—I have been about the Docks since—I left the prisoner and the man both together at the Phœnix when I had deposited the wine MR BALLANTINE Q When was it the prisoner said anything to you about Dunks A The night he was apprehended—he had not said a word to me about Dunks before—the prisoner did not mention the name of Dunks or show me any authority from whom he was acting when he told me to tell the cooper I came from Dingwell and Co —he did not introduce me to the man in the white waistcoat at all RICHARD MICHAELMORE I am clerk at the East-vault London Docks There is wine there consigned to Dingwell and Co —on the 17th of Nov the prisoner produced a sample order No 1 to me purporting to come from Messrs Dingwell—I know it by my initials to it—the name of the vessel and captain is mentioned—it would require some knowledge of those particulars to fill up an order of this kind—I signed the order Sample R M in red ink across the middle and gave it out—that would entitle the cooper to draw the order—I received the sample order on the 21st and order No 2 also from the prisoner and signed it in the usual way Cross-examined Q To whom did you give the order on the 17th of Nov A I received it from the prisoner but cannot say whether he took it back probably he did—I am sure I received it from him because I knew him previously—it took me two or three minutes to sign it—I had to refer to a book—the prisoner had to come to a window—three or four people can stand at the window—I had no conversation with the party—it was merely handed in at the window signed after looking at the book and handed out again—I got the order on the 21st from the prisoner and gave it to the prisoner—I recollect that it being the second order—I particularly noticed that because I knew him—I knew him the first name—I looked at him more the second time because he came for the same quality of wine—people often come for the same quality of wine—he was there about the same time on the 21st about two or three minutes—I had no conversation with him MR BALLANTINE Q Do you mean you often have to deliver samples of the same wine to the same person A Yes—after the third order I made a communication to the Dock authorities—I have frequently seen the prisoner about the Docks and know him to be there tasting and sampling wine BENJAMIN JAMES RANDELL I am cooper s time-keeper in the East-vault London Docks On the 17th of Nov I received the sampling order marked 1 —I received all four orders—I delivered them to Samuel Skey the cooper Cross-examined Q You do not remember who you got it from A Not on the

of the London Dockes On the 17th of Nov I received an order from Randall and on the 28th another—I only received the first and the last—the prisoner was present on the 17th—I had shown him wine several times before I knew him—I delivered the samples to the porter who was with him—on the 28th I delivered the samples to the porter alone—Middleton was the cooper on the 28th—I think his name is

the firm and one of the clerks—there is nobody here but me JOHN CLEMENT I am constable of the London Docks On the 28th of Nov in conseqence of a communication made to me I stopped Elston the porter at the west-end of the Docks just inside the Dock wall—he had a basket and twenty-two samples of wine—I took him to the guard-house—he only remained there a few minutes—he gave me a description—of the party who gave him the order—I did not know him by description—I sent Elston forward to the Dock Coffee-house and went there myself but could not find the prisoner—on the 9th of Dec I went to a public-house on Tower-hill and saw the prisoner—I told him I was an officer belonging to the London Docks and said You have lodged some orders at the east-vault of the London Docks for samples of wine in the name of Dingwell and Co and they turn out to be forgeries —he said i know nothing about them —Walker the cooper was standing at the door of the room and said to him Is this the man meaning the prisoner—he said Yes —the prisoner then said Oh I recollect now you mention the name I had the orders from Dunks —I said I know nothing about Dunks these two men walker and Middleton say they drew the wines for you on the 21st and 26th of Nov and you were present —he said Oh yes I know these two young men they did draw the wine I said There are four forged orders lodged —he said I lodged no orders the porters lodge them I had two orders from Dunks—only two —he said so two or three times Prisoner I never said so Witness He said so three times over that he only had two from dunks—I said Who is Dunks —he said he was in the wine trade and he had known him about three months—I asked if he could tell me where he lived—he said he did not know but afterwards mentioned several places where he thought I could find him—I had been to the places he mentioned as Croft s in the Strand the Dock Coffee-house and a coffee-house in the Minories—I searched him and in his pocket-book found some blank tasting orders and a paper of the particulars of wines lying in the London and in St Katharine s Docks—they were the same sort of orders and might be filled up in the way those are which have been produced Cross-examined Q Are they such orders as wine agents have A Yes—the Company furnish them—they can be obtained on application—if the person says he is in the wine trade they give them—the prisoner said Dunks is in the wine trade I have known him three months and he also added He asked me to get the samples for him and said he supposed they were Dunks wine - - WALKER I am a cooper in the London Dockes—I sampled some of the wine for the prisoner—I was present when the prisoner was taken—I heard him say Dunks was the man—I did not hear him say how many orders he had from Dunks—I did

the Docks four or five times but had never drawn samples in my life—the prisoner never showed me any sampling orders—I do not know Dingwell and Co —I know Dunks by sight—I do not know what waistcoat he wears—I have been to the Dock Coffee-house to make enquiries for him—I dare say they knew him there and the prisoner also—I never used any of the prisoner s orders—I knew the prisoner was in the habit of sampling wine—if I wanted any wine from any wine-merchant I have employed the prisoner to get it—I have only done so twice—I got the orders from ward Brothers and Co —I never tasted any of those wines—I have not tasted wines which the prisoner has got more than five times—I will swear I have not twenty times—when I said twice I meant twice in that house—I have not got samples from any

merchants—I have paid the prisoner 30s altogether—I have paid him 5s at one time—the first time was about four months ago MR DOANE Q He did not sell wine he was a wine agent A Yes—when I wanted him I

Cross-examined Q Have you a shop A No a small private house and perfumery pomatum and lip-salve in it—I make lip-salve—I occupy the lower part of the house—I have never seen the prisoner before—I believe Dunks is keeping out of the way COURT Q When did you hear that A I saw him last Thursday—had no power to take him—I met him in Fleet-street near Temple-bar—I said to him You are going to destroy this young man that was at the Old Bailey last Session —he said what is that to you —we did not walk Arm-in-arm—I parted with him—he turned and walked five or six doors with Me—he said I could often have earned a pound if I had gone down to the Docks with him—I did not go with him Q How do you know he got his living by getting samples of wine out of the docks did you ever see him in the docks in your life Q I have met him at a public-house with samples of wine and he has applied to me to fill up blank forms for him—about six months ago he showed some to me he said he would put 1l In

merely saluted me in the street just for a few minutes—he has passed me several times in the street before that and since this occurrence GUILTY Aged 43 — Transported for seven Years 
t18470104-378  378 THOMAS WARMINGTON CROWTHER was indicted for feloniously forging an order for the payment of 30l with intent to defraud william Dixon and others —2nd COUNT for uttering the same with a like intent —3rd COUNT stating his intent to be to defraud Montagu shearman MR CLARKSON conducted the prosecution MONTAGU SHEARMAN I am an attorney and live at No 14 Duke-street Adelphi I keep a banking account at the house of Brookes Dixon and co Chancery-lane—the prisoner was in my service as clerk—he quitted me on Saturday 5th Dec —no part of this cheque for 30l drawn on my bankers and signed in my name is my handwriting—I believe it to be the prisoner s writing—I never gave him any authority to draw on my bankers in my name Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you pay the prisoner any salary A No—I know him to be of highly respectable connections and the brother of a clergyman—I believe he was articled to an attorney in the country—after being articled he was in Mr Lithgow s office—Mr Lithgow took a partner named Martin with whom the prisoner subsequently became partner as solicitors—I also know that he became involved in Martin s liabilities to an enormous amount—Martin took the benefit of some Act—I afterwards took the prisoner into my employment—he had several business friends and connection who might be important to my business and it was understood that as far as he could he should bring the connection of his partner to me—after a period I proposed to allow him a participation in the profits of the business—it was understood he was to have a share in the business in the interval between the period when he came to me and that period—he conducted himself in a manner that me with my entire approval up to very recently before this transaction—in consequence of his connection with some woman I remonstrated with him and the result of that remonstrance was that he immediately married her—he appeared very eccentric and irritable at my remonstrance—what he was entitled to depended on what he had expended—he had kept my cash and I should have had to go through that to ascertain—I am afraid he would not have been entitled to anything but I am not able to speak with certainty—if he had wanted 20l Or 30l I should have let him have it—after I remonstrated with him I handed him a cheque for 20l for business purposes and in consequence of the exceeding eccentricity of his manner I took it away from him—he occasionally had possession of my cheque-book—I drawn cheques on plain pieces of paper but very rarely—I usually draw them on the printed form—I never spelt Mr Dixon s name wrong—I have not balanced my cash-book yet—the prisoner kept the cash the whole of the time—I had the highest opinion of his integrity and conduct—I had not known him before he got embarrassed with this Mr Martin—he went away the very day I made the complaint which was on Saturday the 5th Dec WILLIAM WALKER I am one of the cashiers at the house of Dixon and Co in Chancery-lane—there are three partners William Dixon Francis Henry Brooks and John Shot Dixon On Saturday the 5th Dec at about four o clock this cheque was presented to me at the banking-house—I do not know by whom—it was the busiest day of the week and the busiest hour of the day—I paid it in the three 10l notes—one of the notes was No 26577 which note I have now in my hand—the writing and signature of the cheque has a resemblance to that of Mr Shearman but in the hurry of business I did not notice it as I should have done—the prisoner never had any account at Dixons to my knowledge—I have been in the house twenty-three years Cross-examined Q Do you mean to represent that there is the smallest resemblance to Mr Shearman s handwriting A Yes—I am in the habit of paying his cheques—I did not notice that the cheque was drawn on Dickson and Co in the hurry of business—Mr Shearman rarely draws on blank paper—to my knowledge he never signed his name without the Christian and surname being joined together—there is a similarity in the handwriting in the word Shearman —I thought so in the moment of business—I should not have paid it unless it had struck me so at the moment—I mean to swearthere is a resemblance in the writing of the surname COURT Q Did you believe it to be the handwriting of the Mr Shear-man who has been examined and who has an account at your house A Yes and U paid it on that account GEORGE SMITH I keep the star and Grater public-house in Sloane-square Chelsea On Saturday the 5th of Dec last I received a 10l note from Catherine Mulcher and gave her change for it—I know this to be the note because I marked it with my initials CATHERINE MULCHER On the 5th of Dec last I was in the service of Mrs Nutt of 35 Sloane-square Chelsea—the prisoner lodged at her house—he gave me a 10l note that day some time before six o clock in the evening and told me to get it changed—I took it to the Star and Garter public-house kept by Smith and got it changed by him—I gave the money to the prisoner the same evening ROBERT SMITH police constable B 72 On Wednesday evening the 9th of Dec I apprehended the prisoner in Solane-square—I searched him and found on him this cheque— producing one MONTAGUE SHEARMAN re-examined I am acquainted with the prisoner s handwriting—I have seen him write as my clerk—I believe this cheque produced

having marked it first with my initials which indicated that the order was to be executed—the amount of the goods was from 50l to 60l —there is no direction on the letter—it came in an envelope—we have a customer named W Jackson residing at the Debenham Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q On what day did you receive the paper A On Saturday the 9th—it came by post—the envelope was destroyed among a variety of others—we do not keep the envelopes—I have not searched for it but conclude I have destroyed it—this mark on the letter is a cross as having been looked out and examined with the order—I

with it—they were directed agreeably to the address here William Jackson Debenham by the three o clock train to Ipswich till called for—were packed in a box which I sent to the Cross Keys by a man named Avery FREDERICK AVERY I am in the employ of Pawson and Co On the 9th of Jan I took a box directed to Mr Jackson Debenham to the Cross keys Wood-street—I have my book here with the entry in it—it

Suffolk—I have my book here with the entry—I sent the box by the three o clock train which stops at Ipswich Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Is this the book you made the entry in at the time A Yes I enter the articles at the time they are brought in—this entry was made by me—after I make the entry I go on the plateform and see my parcels delivered Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Do you know the person you received the box from A The porter who drove the cart from the Cross Keys I think it was Hill but I am not certain as the porters change—I have an entry of a box received directed to Jackson of Debenham—I give my evidence from the entry in my book—I entered the box in the book and the porter put it into a barrow—I know it was put into the barrow and taken to the platform—I know it was forwarded to the train—I myself saw the man wheel them out to the luggage-van—it was one of my porters—he is not here MR HUDDLESTON Q You did it directly you received the box A Yes HENRY PATTLE I am a clerk at the Ipswich station of the East Union Railway On the 9th of Jan I received a box by the three o clock train directed to Jackson Debenham—I do not remember anything else on the direction—I know Lainson—I saw him at the station about five minutes after receiving the box—he came into my office and I heard him speak to Page the porter—when he came in he looked about at the parcels—I heard Page ask him what he was looking for—he said A box addressed to Jackson of Debenham —the porter said If you will wait a minute Mr Pattle will tell you —I looked over the way-bill and there was one for Jackson of Debenham—he said he had come for it from Debenham—I then entered it in a book which I have here and he signed for it—here is the book—he has signed his name J Jackson —I saw him sign it Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Had you ever seen Lainson before A Never—this was almost the work of a moment—we had not many people there at the time—we have generally—there was nobody with him—I saw a great many people that day but they did not all come into the office many did—Lainson s general appearance enables me to speak to him—I should know him anywhere if I saw him—there is nothing particular about him—I have been clerk there four or five months—I cannot speak to all the people who come there JOHN PAGE I am a porter at the East Union Railway On the 9th of Jan I saw the prisoner Lainson at the station—I was wheeling the parcels in my barrow to the twelve minutes after five o clock train—he walked by my side and looked over my basket—I said What are you looking for —he did not speak—I said Are you looking for anything sir —he said I am looking for a parcel in the name of Jackson —I called Mr Pattle and said Mr Pattle is there a parcel for Mr Jackson of Debenham —he looked over the way-bill and said Yes —I took the box into the office and carried it to the Shipwrights Arms not very far from the station—Lainson said he was going to take it to the public-house the Shipwrights Arms and I volunteered to take it—I did not take it into the house—he said he did not want to have it taken into the house that he had a conveyance to take it to Debenham and I left it outside Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q I suppose you had not seen the man before A I had seen him before that day walking about but not to speak to him nor to take notice of him—it was for a very few minutes—I was brought up to Guildhall to fix on the man I had seen—he was in the dock—the moment I saw him I knew him—I knew both parties—nobody pointed him out to me and I had not been there before—I did not know the dock from the other part of the Court—I saw the two prisoners together—I see a great many people at the Ipswich station—I am able to speak to persons when I take particular notice of them—I have to take particular notice when they are suspicious characters and offer to carry boxes for them when they are dressed like gentleman—whether I get anything for my trouble has nothing to do with this COURT Q You say you knew them both when you saw them at Guildhall A Yes—I have seen them together—I have seen Goodenough round by the station yard and close by the Shipwrights Arms—they were both together that day—I have seen them together before ESTHER LAST I am servant at the Shipwrights Arms Ipswich I know the prisoners—I have seen them at our house—on Wednesday the 6th of Jan they came and lodged there and took their meals together and slept in the same bed-room—they went away on Sunday morning the 10th of Jan —on the evening before that Goodenough was in the passage and asked for a bedcandle—Lainson was not with him—I saw a box in the passage by him—I did not notice the direction on it—I saw them leave next morning—they took a box with them which I had seen in the bed-room—it was wrapped up when I saw it the bed-room and so it was next morning when I saw it—the ostler David Green took it to the station for them—there was no canvas round it on the Saturday night when it came—they addressed each other as brothers—they gave me no name COURT Q Do you mean if one spoke to the other he said Brother A Yes Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Tell us anything they said in that way A I do not know that I can—I waited on them a good many times—they did not call each other Tom and Harry—I never heard them say anything but brother —they did not sleep in a double-bedded room—I am the chambermaid—I do not know that I have ever said anything about their calling each other bother before except to the solicitor JOSEPH HEMSLEY I am a ticket-collector at the railway at Ipswich On Friday the 8th of Jan I was in the parlour of the Shipwrights Arms and saw both the prisoners there—Goodenough spoke first—he said to me My brother has not come down yet —just as he was saying that Lainson came down into the parlour—I had half-a-pint of porter—they had some bread and cheese—there were some writing materials—Lainson wrote a letter handed it to Goodenough and asked what he thought of that signature—Goodenough said he thought it would do very well and told me he expected a parcel down by the three o clock train—he said so on Friday but he did not say on what day he expected it—he asked me which way he was to go to work to get his parcel from the station—I told him if there was a parcel addressed to him at the station and he went and asked for it he could get it by signing his name Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Was the conversation about the parcel on the Friday at the time you saw the writing materials or later in the day A I was there from half-past ten to half-past eleven o clock it was during that time—there was no other person there—I was examined before Alderman Farebrother—I was sworn to give evidence—I was there when the other witnesses were examined—my depositions were crossed out—that was a mistake—I believe I said Friday was the day they told me they expected the parcel down and they understood that I intended to say that they expected the parcel down on Friday and that was the reason my evidence was struck out—this subpœna was given me at Ipswich Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When did you get the subpœna A I cannot say—the officer who came down gave it me at the station and said I was to appear here on Wednesday—I believe it was on Monday—I never said to my knowledge that the prisoner said he expected the parcel down that day—one attorney for one party has got it down that I said he said he expected the parcel down by the three o clock train on Friday and Mr Jones the solicitor for the prosecution has got it down that I did not—I will swear I did not say so—I was sent back without being bound over to appear—they subpœnaed me afterwards—nobody was in the room when Goodenough said to me Good morning and said My brother has not come down yet —Lainson was not there—it was between ten and half-past eleven o clock—when Lainson came into the parlour they had bread and cheese together—I had half a pint of porter and a crust of bread and cheese with them—I had drank and smoked with them on the Thursday evening before in the same room but not at their expense—when Lainson wrote the letter he handed it to Goodenough and asked what he thought of the signature—Goodenough said he thought it would do very well—I was as near to them as I am to you—I did not see anything of the letter—did not look over it—there was nobody else in the room MR HUDDLESTON Q Was it paper of this size he wrote on handing him the forged order A About that size CHARLES BURROWS I am a pawnbroker and live at Ipswich On the 9th of Jan between six and seven o clock in the evening Goodenough came to my shop and left a black satin shawl and two handkerchiefs in pledge with me in the name of John Newell—I have the duplicate Cross-examined Q Were you before the Magistrate A No I first mentioned this about it about a week ago—Mr Jackson came and inquired about such articles on Tuesday I believe—I knew nothing about any inquiry before a Magistrate in London—I think I read something of it in the papers but did not know these were the goods—I had never seen Goodenough before to my recollection—a great many people come to my shop—I take down the name and address of people but no description of them—I do not swear that I can recognise half the people who come but I swear to the prisoner—I recollect him well by his countenance—he was there five or ten minutes—several people were in the shop—I wrote a ticket and pinned it on the goods—I swear he is the person COURT Q When did you come to town A On Tuesday evening—I know that because I remember it was Tuesday—I swear the prisoner is the man—I recollect him well—he was in my shop ten minutes and I talked to him RODERICK DONALD FRAZIER I am a pawnbroker and live at Ipswich On the 9th of Jan about seven o clock in the evening Goodenough pawned two cotton pocket handkerchiefs and one black satin handkerchief at my shop in the name of John Newell of Stoke Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did you take them in A Yes—I had never seen him before—I knew him from his appearance the moment I saw him in Court—I see a great many people but generally know the parties—if it is a stranger I take more notice—being in the country we generally know any stranger we notice—when he was going away he asked me the way to Stoke—I said What part do you want to go to —he said Near the railway station and I directed him and know he is the person—I swear to him—I was not before the Magistrate—I told the attorney what I could prove MR HUDDLESTONE Q He had previously given you his address at Stoke A Yes DAVID GREEN I am ostler at the Shipwright s Arms Ipswich I know the prisoners—on the 10th of Jan I took a box for them to the station—the maid-servant ordered me to take it—the prisoners walked before me holding each other by the arm—I did not notice any direction on the box—it was wrapped up in canvass—I left the box on the platform of the railway THOMAS LEONARD GOODING I am a linen-draper and live at Ipswich On the 9th of Jan to the best of my belief between five and eight o clock in the evening the prisoner Goodenough came to my shop—he bought a piece of hessing which is canvass wrapper about two yards and a half long and paid for it—to the best of my belief this wrapper produced is the piece I sold him Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Will you venture to swear any more than that the wrapper is similar to what you sold A I believe it is the same because it is like it and from the manufacture of it—I have not dined to day—I have had nothing particular to drink only what I paid for—I have drunk what I felt inclined to have—I will not swear I have had nothing—it is very difficult to swear to a thing of this sort—I swear to the best of my belief—there is no mark on it GEORGE POCOCK I am assistant to Mr Nash a pawnbroker of No 27 King-street Borough On the 13th of Jan the prisoner Goodenough pledged seventeen yards of checked silk at our shop for 1l in the name of John Newell COURT Q Did you know him before A Yes I have know him by that name about twelve months—he has pledged in that name—I know nothing more of him than from his coming to the shop—I did not know where he lived but he gave his address king-street which is close to us JOHN HOWELL I am assistant to Mr Mill of Blackman-street Borough On the 11th of Jan this piece of silk was pledged at our shop by an old man not by either of the prisoners WILLIAM BOYCE I am assistant to Mr Reynolds a pawnbroker of Stone s-end Borough On the 15th of Jan sixteen yards of silk were pawned at our shop in the name of John Wilkins—I cannot positively say but to the best of my belief it was by Goodenough Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Were you not busy at the time and did not take particular notice A I did not take particular notice of the person WILLIAM ALFRED LINFORD I am assistant to Mr Lawley of Red Lion-street Borough I produce some silk and a shawl—it was not pawned by either of the prisoners GEORGE TREW City-policeman No 26 On the 18th of Jan I took the prisoners in charge at 7 John s-row Church-lane Hammersmith—they were at breakfast in the back kitchen—I sent for Sergeant Lee—I found on Lainson seven or eight duplicates 11s 4d and three keys—I asked him if he had any box—he said he had a box up stairs—I said Show me the box —he went up stairs and showed it me—I took the key from him unlocked the box and found two pieces of silk five pairs of kid gloves two satin scarfs and three shirt collars— producing them —I have the duplicates but they do not relate to this property WALTER ROBERT LEE policeman T 7 I was with Trew and took Goodenough into custody in St John s-row—I saw him searched and a pair of gloves found on him—I produce two black satin scarfs which I found in a drawer in the front room—nobody told me to go that drawer—in a drawer up stairs I found four linen shirt collar DENNIS SHEPHERD I am silk buyer to Messrs Pawsons I saw the letter of the 9th of Jan and selected a portion of the articles sent by the box—all the fancy goods produced form a portion of the articles selected for the box—I know these fancy silks Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What do you know the price by A By the pattern—I put some silks of that pattern into the box—this is my own pattern made to my order—to the best of my belief it is the particular piece I selected that day—perhaps twenty-five pieces of this pattern were made—this is one dress-length—there are four or five dresses in a piece—there is no particular mark on it—the lengths sent were two dress-lengths—these have been divided—we sent four two dress-lengths—this other piece is a single dress-length—I know it in the same manner being my own pattern—no other house has it—twenty of this patern were made—here is another which I know—there were three pieces of black satin sent—one piece was of the same quality as this produced—there is no mark on it—this other piece is of another quality which we sent—I recognize them by the quality and pattern—I can identify the articles produced by Trew in the same way PHILIP JAMES I am in the employ of Messrs Pawson and Co I believe these black and fancy handkerchiefs to be the goods I selected for an order to be sent to Jackson of Debenham—I selected them myself These were the articles pledged at Ipswich Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Do you recollect of the particular articles but selected things of this description A I perfectly recollect the patterns—we have not a great many of these patterns but we have others—I selected goods of this pattern and quality that day HENRY SILVERLOCK I am landlord of the Queen s Head Maze-pond Borough On the 11th or 12th of Jan the prisoners came to my house and staid about two hours—they had nothing with them—they were toghther WILLIAM JACKSON I am a draper and live at Debenham in Suffolk The prisoner Lainson was in my employment—he came to me about the 16th of Nov and left on or about the 29th of Dec —no part of this letter or signature is my writing—I did not authorize anybody to write it—there is no other Mr Jackson living at Debenham—I cannot speak to the handwriting in the letter Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q What persons have you in your employment A Two assistants named Garner and Spinks—I believe only on one occasion one of them wrote an order for me—they have no authority to write without naming it to me—Garner has been with me two years and a quarter and Spink a month or five weeks COURT Q Is this the writing of either of them A I swear it is not CHARLES CLARK I am a draper and live at No 10 Great Dover-road Southwark Lainson was in my employment about seven years—he left last May—I have seen him write many times and know this letter to be in his writing very well all of it Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Had he occasion to write very frequently A I attended to my business myself—he was shopman—I have seen him writing at the desk and have been with him—I know his writing as well as I do not my own—I am quite positive it is his—I do not believe it possible I could make a mistake—he had occasion to write almost daily—I have seen a good deal of his writing—this is not at all feigned but precisely his natural hand—it was first shown to me about ten days since—I was asked by the officer if I knew that writing—I said directly it is a young man s named Lainson who used to live with me before I was told anything about it and before I saw the signature at all—I said to the officer LAINSON — GUILTY Aged

conducted the Prosecution JAMES COPE I am an engraver and live in Frith-street Soho I have known the prisoner about a year and a half—he owed me an account in Oct last and on the 14th of Oct in the afternoon he came to my house and produced this bill of exchange— looking at it —he said he had drawn that bill on Mr Breese as the result of his quarter s account with that gentleman and if I would give him the difference we would square up or something—he said Breese was one of his the employers that he was a coach-plater living in Hart-street Covent-garden that it was a genuine bona fide trade bill and would be met—it had what appeared to be Breese s acceptance on it at the time and he was speaking of that—in consequence of what he said I took the bill—I knew there was such a person as Breese and that he was a respectable person—I gave the prisoner 11l odd—I cannot exactly tell what he owed me but I believe I paid him 11l 9s —the bill is for 23l 14s —he owed me the difference—I think it was 9l 11s I gave him—it was that or 11l 9s but the learned gentlemen are surrounding me so that I can hardly tell which if I had a fair field I could do COURT Q You gave him the balance whatever it was A Yes—I presented the bill to Breese when it became due—it was not paid Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q I believe you are a bill-discounter A Not professedly—I have occasionally discounted bills—I am not manager of a loan society I am employed by one—I have discounted several bills for the prisoner purporting to be accepted by Breese— the bill was here read dated 12th Oct 1846 at three months for 23l 14s EDWARD BREES I live in Hart-street Covent-garden and am a coachplater The acceptance to this bill is no my handwriting—I know nothing of it—I never authorized the prisoner or any person to accept this bill for me Cross-examined Q It is not at all like your writing is it A It does a little resemble it in the name Breese except the E—I have known the prisoner about twenty years but had not seen him for twelve years till within the last three years—he is a master smith—during the three years we have done a little business together—I never accepted but two bills for him in my life—the last was in January 1846—he came to me and said if I would oblige him by accepting a 19l bill he could not exactly tell what time the party would discount it and asked me to leave the date—this is it looking at it and the only one in existence—there never was but one previous to this which was one for 14l and the prisoner destroyed that—the 19l was an accommodation bill—I did not owe him a shilling—I had paid him my accounts Q Was there not an account between you at that time A Nothing but a few jobs—not 1l altogether—I accepted it entirely to accommodate him as he said in three months he could take it up—I did not pay that bill—he gave me a memorandum at the time Q About the first or second week in Oct were you at the prisoner s shop A I don t think I saw him himself for a week previous to this bill being dated—he had done a few jobs for me and I for him but I did not see him—I think I was at his shop the beginning of Oct —I had paid the balance of his account and had his receipt—he wished me to be security to a loan society for him which I declined—everything was paid—he did not at that time speak to me ablut the 19l bill—he came to me and stated that he had lost the 19l bill and would I accept another that was a few days after the 19th Jan 1846—I objected and did not accept another—he said he had given it to a person to give cash for it and had lost it—I said I should like to see the party give me his address —he said he did not exactly know the address it was somewhere about Clerkenwell—he gave me a memorandum that it was lost which I have here Q When he gave you that memorandum did not you accept this 19l bill A No—said the bill was dated the 16th and the memorandum was dated the day he said he had dated the bill but it appears he had cashed that very bill—I am certain I did not accept a bill instead of that—I only accepted one in Jan —he gave me the memorandum to try to induce me to accept another but I did not Q When you called on him in Oct did you not speak to him about the 19l bill you had accepted in the early part of the year A No—I did not know it was in existence—I had accepted a 14l bill previous to the 19l but never one afterwards—the 14l bill was in Cope s hands and became due in Jan —I said nothing to him in Oct about a bill or bills in Cope s hands—I said nothing at all about any such bills Q Did not he tell you the bill or bills in the hands of Cope had not been taken up and if you would give him your acceptance for 23l 14s he would take them up No—there were no bills in Cope s hands—he did not say that or anything to that effect—nothing was said about a 23l bill at all at the interview in Oct Q Did not you say I bad rather not accept a bill of 23l A I never heard anything of it at all and I never was asked a question about it—he did not say he wanted the bill at once and beg me to accept it at once—he said nothing about it nor did I say very well you may put my name to it nor anything to that effect—I have been in the habit of running into his shop at various times on business—perhaps twice a week at that time about trifling articles—I might have been there two minutes or five or six minutes early in Oct —I did not produce any bills of parcels to him—accounts were not produced on both sides—I don t think I have seen him since the 10th or 12th of Oct myself—this bill was regularly presented by cope for payment—he had not presented any other bill at my house—I had no transaction with Cope on my own account—I have been in business there about five years—I was never in pecuniary difficulties MR PAYNE Q Did you on 12th Oct owe him 23l 14s or anything at all A No and never authorized him to put my name tio any bill—I never accepted any bill for him except the 14l and 19l bills which 19l bill he said was lost—I refused to accept any other—I had left the date of the 19l bill fior him to put in JOHN GARY Police-constable C 10 I apprehended the prisoner on 16th Jan and told him I took him for uttering a forged bill to Mr Cope—he said It was no forgery Cross-examined Q You took him in Earl-street A Yes—about a hundred yards from his own house JAMES COPE re-examined Q Have you discounted bills on Breese before A Bills purporting to be accepted by Breese but previous to their coming to maturity the prisoner took them up—I have discounted bills accepted in writing like both these bills MR PARRY called JOHN LINES I lived in Brompton-road but now live at Islington—I am the prisoner s son-in-law I was at his shop in Earl-street Seven-dails early in Oct —it was about the 10th or 11th of Oct Mr Breese came to the shop—I had never seen him before—I think it was rather before twelve o clock—I was standing just by the bellows and seeing him come in I thought I ought to get out of the way not knowing his business—I got up in a conrner—I was taking some bread and cheese and porter—I could hear what passed—they were talking together about five minutes—Mr Breese was about to leave the shop when Mr Johnson turned to him and said in a faint voice What is It you want —Johnson said I want you to do a little bill for me to-day —Mr Breese said he was in a hurry as he was going somewhere but would be back in about an hour or an hour and a half—Mr Johnson said that would not do it must be done directly—the answer of Mr Breese was Well if that won t do—— —I beg pardon Mr Johnson said Will you allow me to sign it for you —the answer was Why yes it will be all the same Q When did Breese say If that won t do A I was going to tell you wrong sir—Johson asked if he would allow him to sign it for him—Breese said Yes that will do I dare say there is no doubt you know that will do —by that Breese left the shop—nothing was said about If that won t do at all—I was going to tell a falsehood I recollected myself—that is all I remember of the transaction John Crow broker of Great Karl-street Seven-dials George Blair saddler of Brewer-street Golden-square George Houghton saddler of prince s-street Soho gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 52 — Transported for Ten years

t18470510-1134  1134 ALFRED WILBEAM and NICHOLAS KERP were indicted for feloniously forging and uttering a bill of exchange for 500l with intent to defraud Richard Fuller and another and JOSEPH ALEXANDER for feloniously harbouring and maintaining the said prisoners knowing them to have committed the said felony —Other COUNTS for forging and uttering an acceptance to the said bill and verying the manner of laying the charge MESSRS CLARKSON and PAYNE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM GERRANRD OHRLY I live in St Thomas s-square Hackney I was a merchant but have retired from business I keep an account at Messrs Fuller s bank—I called there about the 16th of Jan and from discoveries I made this bill of exchange for 500l was shown to me— looking at it —the acceptance is not my handwriting—I never authorized anybody to accept it and do not know the drawer JAMES SIBTHORPE BAKER I am a clerk in the banking-house of Messrs Richard Fuller and another there are only two partners On the 29th of Dec last this bill was presented at our banking-house—it has Received J Brown on the back—I cannot say whether that was written at our house or before it was presented—Mr Ohrly is a customer of ours—I believed the acceptance to be genuine and paid the bill by four 100l notes Nos 67108 L C 62552 65405 and 70102 and two of 50l Nos 10826 N B and 13781 N B —the initials refer to the date—they are a private mark of the back on the notes—I should say the bill was presented soon after ten o clock between ten and eleven—the Bank of England is about 250 or 300 yards from Fuller s bank going out the back way—it is at the corner of Moorgate-street—a few minutes after I paid the bill Mr Higman a clerk of the Bank of England came and asked me something about the notes—I answered him that all was right—he mentioned the four 100l notes but I think not the 50l CHARLES BAWTREE I am a clerk in the Bank of England I produce four 100l notes and two for 50l J S BAKER re-examined I do not any writing on them which I should know them by but I know the numbers—they are the notes I gave for the bill Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q I believe you have no recollection of the person who presented the bill A None at all—I received the bill myself and paid the person the notes for it—the bill was not handed to me by one of our clerks JOSEPH REECE ADAMS I am a clerk at the Bank of England I remember these four 100l notes being brought to my office which is the issue department on the 29th of Dec before twelve o clock in the day—I am not certain of the time—I received them from I think the prisoner Kerp but am not quite certain—I the name of Helen No 3 Bond-street is written on the back of the notes—we require the name and address to be put on the notes before we pay them—it was brought to me with that name and address on it—I could not read the address very well and enquired of the man what it was—he said No 3 Bond-street and I wrote that again—the notes were brought for gold and before I paid them I took them to Mr Higman who left the office at my suggestion to go to Fuller s as I had suspicion and asked the man where he received the notes—he said at Fuller s—here is the name of Jones on one of the 50l notes—I cashed that note at a different time within five minutes before or after—it is No 10826 8th Oct 1846 N B —it was probably changed for the same man but I took no notice of the person then the note being a small one—it might be the same man or another—the N B denotes the date—if the lower part of the note is destroyed this would tell us the date—there is L C on the 100l notes WILLIAM HIGMAN I am principal in the issue department of the Bank On the 29th of Dec between ten and half-past ten o clock in the morning Mr Adams brought these four 100l notes to me as it is not usual to be asked for gold for so large an amount—I made inquiry of the man and noticed his person and am perfectly certain in my own mind it was Kerp—he is the man I have not a doubt about it—I asked him from whom he obtained the notes—he said from Messrs Fuller s—I stepped out at the back door of the Bank while the matter was being arranged—I went to Fuller s and understanding all was right I ordered payment to be made Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Do you hand over the notes or do the clerks under you do that A The clerks under me—I see a great many people—I do not recollect ever seeing Kerp before—he did not wear moustachios I believe—the impression on my mind is that he did not—I will not swear it positively—I swear positively Kerp is the man to my belief—I particularly noticed him and did not notice any moustachios—it was an unusual thing coming for so large a quantity of gold—he was there altogether about a quarter of an hour—I had a good opportunity of looking at him which I did having suspicion something was wrong—I do not know how he was dressed—he wore a hat—I saw him next at Guildhall and pointed him out to the solicitor—he was not pointed out to me—he was standing in the dock MR CLARKSON Q Had you any doubt of him before the Magistrate A None MOSES SAMUELS I live in Strutton-ground Westminster On the 29th of Dec about nine o clock in the morning Kerp came running into my shop—I did not know him before—Brown Wilbeam was with him—he was called Brown then—Brown was dressed wretchedly—they both came in and wanted clothes for Brown—his trowsers and every thing were ragged—here are the clothes he was dressed in and which he left behind—Kerp called him by the name of Brown—I sold them a coat waistcoat trowsers neck-handkerchief boots and hat—Kerp paid for them—Brown out the clothes on and they left—after two o clock Brown came into the shop again very merry and took out a double purse full of sovereigns and said I have got it —I could see through the purse that it contained sovereigns at each end—I asked him from where he got it—he said They young man who came with me who gave me the clothes gave it to me —there might be 100 sovereigns more or less—he said Will you be so kind if the young man calls here for me to tell him to call tomorrow soon after twelve o clock —next day after twelve o clock they both came—I cannot recollect which came in first—Kerp said to Brown What was the matter why did you run away yesterday —Brown said to Kerp I heard the bankers ask you such questions where you got the notes and how you came by the notes and Kerp said I told him I got the notes from Fuller s bank he asked where I resided I said in Bond-street —that is all that passed Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q I believe you had never seen Brown before A No nor Kerp—they were at my shop about a quarter of an hour on the 29th—Brown merely came in the afternoon left the massage and showed me the purse—he shook it in his hand—I have no shopman—there was nobody in the shop except my wife—she was there both times and when they called next day she saw Brown rattling the purse—it was not my business to ask him where he got it—I said nothing to him about it—my wife was in the parlour but saw him—I do not know what he meant by it —they might stay five or six minutes the next day—I cannot say which came in first—I and Mr Samuels were quite silent—Kerp said What did you run away for yesterday Brown said The bankers asked you such a set of question and kept you there so long I ran away —Kerp said I answered them that I got the notes from Fuller s bank I told them where I got the notes they asked where I resided and I told them —they then went away—I did not drink with them on either occasion and did not see them again till they were in custody—I have lived in Strutton-ground seven years—before that I was a licensed traveller with jewellery for three years—I bought jewellery at Birmingham and different places—I cannot recollect the name of anybody at Birmingham who I bought goods of—I have purchased of Davis in Houndsditch—before I travelled with jewellery I manufactured slippers at my warehouse in Houndsdich—I kept men there—I kept that shop a good many year—I do not know how the prisoners came to appoint to meet at my shop—I did not tell the police about Brown having the sovereigns—it was nothing to me—I thought nothing of it Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Both Brown and Kerp were strangers to you A Yes—I could not tell whether it was an honest transaction—I am free from any impeachment—I cannot tell what I thought about it—I have my suspicions now—I did not ask any questions—my business would not go on well of I did—I am not quite a stranger to Alexander—I have known him for two years—I did not see him about this time at all—I will swear that—it was not him who brought Brown to my place—I have never been a friend of Alexander s—I was bail for him once as his own solicitor s son was the first bail—I was not paid for it—I did it from friendship at last out of favour—it is above a year ago—he did not bring me any customers nor deal with me—I got nothing for being his bail MR CLARKSON A Are you a German by birth A A Polander—Kerp is a German Alexander is a Polander Wilbeam is an Engishman COURT Q Had Kerp any moustachios on the morning of the 29th A He had very little—they have grown bigger now WILLAM HENRY EDWARDS City police-constable No 139 On the 6th of Feb last I was stationed near Bartholomew-lane by the London and Westminster Bank between three and four o clock in the afternoon—I saw the three prisoners standing together at the corner of Bartholomew-lane—Alexander beckoned me across—I did not go at first—he beckoned again—I ran towards them and Kerp ran down Angle-court—I ran after him—he was stopped without my losing sight of him—I brought him back to Wilbeam and Alexander who met me some yards up the court—when I got up to them Alexander told me he gave them both in charge—I asked him for what—he said Forgery on Fuller s Smith and Payne s and the Bank of England —I proceeded on with them towards the station-house and as we went along Alexander said to Kerp and Willbeam I have been looking for you the last two or three months and have got you at last —I kept them both in custody and in proceeding on Alexander said to Kerp Your father has gone to Germany with 3000l or 4000l belonging to the bankers and they will rue it when they find it out —at that time the three prisoners were with me—after that some words passed between Alexander and Wilbeam which I did not understand as it was broken English—Wilbeam then said to me that Alexander had got no change against him—Alexander instantly said No I have got no charge against him that is the villain pointing to Kerp—I then said to Wilbeam You had better come along with me —he said he would—I then came through Coleman-street and Fore-street and missed Wilbeam—I proceeded with the prisoner Kerp and Alexander to the station—the inspector there declined to take the charge—I then at the request of Alexander went with Kerp to Messrs Fuller s and there after a conversation Mr Fuller gave Kerp in charge—on the 31st of March I went into a coffee-shop in Victoria-street Little Queen-street Lincoln s Inn-fields and saw Wilbeam—I asked if he knew Alexander—he said he did—I asked if he knew me—he said he did not—I was not in my uniform—I then asked if he did not recollect an occurrence which took place on the 6th of Feb about twenty minutes to four o clock—he said he did—I told him I was a policeofficer he must come with me—in going along I told j-him I did not wish him to say anything to criminate himself I did not wish him to say anything that would be against him in Court as he was talking to us— an officer named Speak was with me —he said he did not care he would speak the truth—he then said that Alexander gave him the order to go to Fuller s to receive change for the check for 500l that he changed it and got four 100l and two 50l notes which he gave to Alexander and he was to have 25l for his trouble Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Did both you and Speck go to the coffee-house A Yes—we were both in plain clothes—I had my uniform on when I saw him in the City—Alexander and Kerp were in custody when I took Wilbeam and had been examined I dare say half-a-dozen times—I had not ascertained from Fuller s that it was 100l notes that were given for the bill—I was told by Alexander what the notes were—Speck and I went to the coffee-shop from information received—Speck had been in the case before—Alexander had been given in charge for stealing a half-crown—we both knew the facts of the case as they had been stated at the Police-court—Wilbeam said himself that he changed the check or order for 500l —they were not my words—we both cautioned him—I told him before he said anything not to criminate himself as it would be used in Court against him—that was in Queen-street—Speck cautioned him immediately after—a man named on was also with us—I was conversing with Wilbeam for about ten minutes on the matter on the way to the Police-court—I have heard that he is a journeyman painter—when Alexander and him were talking on the 6th of Feb I did not understand what they said—I have not said I heard them speaking in a foreign language—I have been in the police eight years—I went with Wilbeam to Mr Taylor of Furnival s Inn—I left him on the landing with my brother officer while I went to inform Mr Taylor I had got him Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Alexander beckoned twice before you went over A Yes—as people frequently beckon to omnibuses I did not go at first—Kerp ran away when I ran over—he got about half-way up the court—I ran after him leaving Wilbeam with Alexander—there was plenty of time for them to get away—I should have had to go a good way to find another policeman—I saw one half way down Moorgate-street but I did not want assistance—the conversation was in broken English—Alexander is a Pole and speak rather bad English—we went to Fuller s bank after going to the station—the inspector said we might go to Fuller s if Alexander thought proper—Alexander said nothing but went with us—after he gave them is charge I put my hands on them both—I then walked behind the two—Alexander walked alongside Wilbeam Kerp was outside Wilbeam in the middle—I kept my eye on the three—some words passed between wilbeam and Alexander in Moorgarate-street and then Wilbeam and Alexander stood talking together—they walked together behind me and I kept Kerp—I did not conceive wilbeam was in my custody then as he said he had no charge against him—I did not say Why you said you had a charge before —I did not see Wilbeam leave—the station-house is about ten minutes walk—I missed Wilbeam about three minutes walk from the station—Mr Taylor is solicitor in this case—I met Alexander at Mr Taylor s once since this but had no conversation with him about this charge—he was in the private room and I in the outer office—I do not know what his business was—I am not aware of a reward in this case MR CLARKSON Q Was it in consequence of Alexander s telling you he had no charge against Wilbeam that your attention was diverted from him A Yes WILLIAM CARTER GATES I am acquainted with Alexander s hand writing— I was his attorney once —the words Received J Brown at the back of this bill I really believe to be his writing but I have my doubts of it—I have strong reason to believe it is—here is the name of J Jones on one of the 50l notes—I really believe that to be Alexander s handwriting—here is the name of Aldridge Millwall on one—I have the same doubt of that as of the name on the bill—it is similar to the writing on the bill but the J Jones 10 Church-street I am positive of—Alexander can write almost any hand— Jones is more undisguised—I believe the other to be his writing also—he was not my clerk Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q You have no doubt about the name of Jones A I have every reason to believe it is his—I only speak to the name of Jones 10 Church-street Trinity-square —I can swear and feel confident that is Alexander s writing—I saw it first before coming into Court last sessions and stated my belief to the solicitor—I have seen him write a great number of times and have no doubt of its being his Prisoner Alexander Q How long have you known me A Since March twelve months—I became acquainted with you at your attorney s Mr Richardson s—I forget where I resided then—I am a solicitor—I was admitted in 1824—I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act sixteen years ago THOMAS RICHARD BEEBY I live in Kirby-row Kingsland I don s know whose writing this J Aldridgs Millwall is on this note—this J Jones Church-street Trinity-square on the other 50l note I believe to be Alexander s writing COURT Q What means have you knowing his writing A I have known him since 1838 and seen him write at least 500 or 600 times—I cannot speak to this Received J Brown on the back of the bill Prisoner Alexander Q What are you A Clerk to Mr Ball attorney Dyer s-hall Dowgate-hill—I have been with him six weeks—I know John Jubilee Spiller—I never was indicted for conspiracy—spiller was indicted for conspiracy and acquitted—I knew Gordon who was indicated with him at the Old Bailey—I have not the slightest feeling against Alexander and have not endeavoured to get people to bring cases against him GEORGE ARTHUR FULLER I am a banker and carry on business with my brother in Moorgate-street On 6th February Edwards the policeman came to our house with Kerp and Alexander—Alexander stated that he had come to give us information that we were forged upon to a large amount by a gang of German swindlers—I asked how he knew a forgery had been committed on our house—he said he had either heard it at Samuels or Samuels had told him of it and if we referred to our books on 29th December we should find that we had paid a forgery for 500l —I knew we had paid a forged bill but could not recollect the date—I called the clerks—Mr Baker brought his book and we found that was the day the forgery was paid—I gave Kerp in charges as Alexander said he was one of the parties—Kerp was in charge of one of the officers in the outer office at the time—Alexander was in the back office MR BALLANTINE to MOSES SAMUELS Q Did you ever tell Alaxander a forgery had been committed on Fuller s bank A Yes three days after he came to my house and I stated it to him and showed him

WILLIAM TRIPHOOK I am in the service of Mr Findlay a portrait-painter in the Strand—he has a brother a tailor at Birmingham—on the 8th if July I presented this check for payment and received 1l for it which I gave to my employer—on a Saturday about a month ago I went with another check of a similar kind I was then told they were forgeries and was detained JOHN LIPTROTT FINDLEY I am a tailor and draper and live in Monmouth-street Birmingham In the beginning of July the prisoner came to my shop and selected a coat and trowsers—he requested the coat should be put by and left a shilling on it—the trowsers he wanted to take away—they came to 6s 6d —he tendered in payment this check for 1l purporting to be drawn by Lord Skelmersdale—he indorsed this one the back of it Pay to Mr Findley C Wheeler —from the smallness of the amount I suspected it was not genuine and I said it was not regular to take these things in business but if he would leave it I would remit it to my brother—he agreed to that at once and he showed me this letter enclosed in an envelope—he called on the Saturday evening afterwards took the trowsers and I paid him the balance 11s 6d Prisoner Q Was there any objection on my part when I brought the cheek to give my address A Not the slightest—it was my proposition that you should indorse it and you agreed to it—I did not sufficiently examine it to know whether the indorsement and the body of the check are the same writing—I sent it up to my brother to get it cashed—I believe your address was found to be correct—I made no enquiry as to who or what you were—I had a young man in my employ who went by the name of Frederick he is not here LORD SKELMERSDALE I keep an account at Messrs Coutts —I have been in the habit of drawing checks for small sums in case of charity—I never saw this check till the day before yesterday—it is not my writing—I never authorized any one to write it—the prisoner received an annual subscription from me for a society

Mrs Wheeler Prisoner Q Has your lordship known anything detrimental to my character during the seventeen years I have belonged to that society A No JOHN NULT SAYER I am a printer—I have known the prisoner seventeen years—I cannot say that I have seen him write—I may have done so—I have corresponded with him and have acted on communication from him in writing—I believe this check to be his handwriting—there are characters in it which very much resemble his writing this L the W and w and b—I should not able to say it was his writing positively but for the reason I have given and the general character of the writing I believe it to be his Prisoner Q In what way did you become a witness A The inspector came to me and asked if I could recognize your writing—I said yes because yours was a very peculiar hand—he showed me some papers and asked if they were yours—I said Yes I should not swear that these checks were your writing—I do not expect any reward for attending here—I was summoned before the magistrate and was bound to appear here JOSEPH THOMPSON policemen 62 F I took the prisoner at Burmingham on the 7th of July—he said it was not a forgery he should be able to make it all right Prisoner Q Did you not ask for a person named Wheeler and did I not say I was the person A Yes I went down to Birmingham on the Saturday and I went to you on the Tuesday—the reason of the delay from Saturday till Tuesday was that Mr Findley had mislaid your address and I ascertained it afterwards at the election committee-room—you first requested me to accompany you to Mr Findley s—you asked me to go before the Mayor and magistrates and said you should exonerate yourself—I refused to go before the Mayor—you asked me for my warrant—I said I had none—you went to the Windsor Castle Inn and called a man named Dan and said to him You saw me receive the parcel and he said Yes —you said You saw me cut the parcel and there were some clothes in it —he said Yes —I said to the man Did you see a check in it —ha said No —I said That don t assist you much Wheeler I told you I had no power to take you before the Magistrate MR BODKIN Q You were sent down from London to apprehend him A Yes—I went down a private dress and said something about the election—the prisoner was a sergeant in the police force at the commencement of the force Prisoner s Defence I am the victim of a conspiracy which I may call secret I wrote to Mr Alderson in London and said there was the annual money due from his lordship and other money that I had the collecting of and he said if I sent the receipt the money would be forwarded I sent the recepts and received back in an envelope these two checks for 1l each I went to the banker s and asked them to cash them they said they would not for that small amount but any tradesman would I then went to Mr Findlay s and left one check for a week it was honoured and then I called and presented the other and that was refused—I deny the forgery but admit uttering the checks his lordship has known me seventeen years the person I sent the receipt to sent me the checks and the officer has taken no steps to find him the man has absconded I am the victim through that man who I consider perpetrated the forgery LORD SKELMERSDALE re-examined I was not indebted to the prisoner—I cannot how long the society to which he was secretary ceased Samuel Ware Esq

t18470920-2117  2117 GEORGE HAYWARD was again indicted for forging and uttering an order for the payment of 140l with intent to defraud Thomas Hallifax and other —2nd COUNT with intent to defraud John Fenton and WILLIAM ALEXANDER as an accessory before and after the fact MESSRS BODKIN and PARNELL conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM THOMAS I am a clerk to Messrs Glyn Hallifax and Co bankers—Mr Thomas Hallifax is one of the partners—there are five others—the check produced was presented to me for payment on the 19th of June—it is for 140l purporting to be drawn by John Fenton in favour of Beresford and Co —I cashed it in two 50l Bank of England notes and 40l in gold—the numbers of the notes are 90858 and 84837 dated 6th Jan 1847—I do not think I should know the person again who presented it—I do not think it was either of the prisoners Cross-examined by MR EVANS Q Did you make the entry yourself A I did RICHARD JOHN SYKES I am a clerk in the issue department in the Bank of England—this 50l note No 84837 6th Jan 1847 was presented at the bank on the 19th of June last just as the clock was striking five—it was the last note I cashed—I gave fifty sovereigns for it—the name of John Fenton is on it—it was not written by the person who presented it—he came in very late and to save time the inspector of notes wrote it Cross-examined by MR EVANS Q Do you know who presented it A It was presented by a boy—I do not know that I have ever seen him since— the boy Constable was here called in —to the best of my recollection it was a buy about his size—I think he had a jacket on at the time WILLIAM THOMAS re-examined That boy is something like the boy who presented the check to me—I certainly would not swear to him—he was about his age—as to his countenance I cannot say JAMES PARSONS MELMOTH I am a clerk to Messrs Glyn and Co —the check produced has been taken out of this check-book looking at one —the number is 877—that is not a number that runs all through the book—the number preceding is 876 and the last in the book is 878—I find the margin of this particular check left in the book—I issued that book from the banking-house on the 19th of June in consequence of a written order—I destroyed the order—it was very similar to Mr Fenton s writing—it purported to be an order from Mr Fenton and was worded Please to deliver to bearer a check-book and oblige yours truly JOHN FENTON Cross-examined by MR EVANS Q Are you sure it was destroyed A I am quite positive of it—I always was so—I never said I thought I had lost it—I told Mr Bush I thought I might be able to find the fragments but I never could—I never said I thought I could find it MR BODKIN Q Did you search for the fragments A No —one of our porters did—I destroyed it at the moment—it was several days after I had destroyed it and thrown the fragments down that I directed them to be looked for—a boy very similar to Constable brought it—I cannot swear to him—the same boy afterwards presented the check for payment—it was presented on the same day within an hour or two afterwards—Mr Thomas showed me the check and I said Yes it is all right it is Mr Fenton s check he came from Mr Fenton s just now and the boy said No Mr Fenton s clerk sent me for it COURT Q What time elapsed before the check was presented after the book was obtained A About two hours to the best of my belief—that did not excite my suspicion at all—it was another circumstance that excited Mr Thomas s suspicion MR EVANS Q Are you quite certain that is the book you issued on that day A To the best of my belief—I am certain by the entry—the entry is my writing and also the number of the check because I register the numbers as well and in that book I find all the numbers in the check-book—they commence from 801 to 901—I made the entry on the 19th of June and my name stands against it COURT Q Have you the same number of checks in each book you send out A No—in some there are 50 in some 500 in some 5000—it entirely depends on the nature of the account MR EVANS Q How does Mr Fenton sign his name A In the same way that this is signed—I am not a cashier but I know his handwriting—I should not hesitate in the least in saying that was his—I am not in the habit of paying checks—I know the writing of all the customers—Mr Thomas applied to me when the check came and asked my opinion upon it—he said It is all right is it not I said Yes it is all right and he paid it upon his own responsibility and mine WILLIAM KING policeman H 83 I found this check-book in Crispin-street Spitalfields in the middle of the carriage-way about a quarter to two o clock in the morning on the 16th of July last—I only saw one person near at the time I picked it up—he was crossing the street—the nearest I saw him was about twelve yards—I could not see who he was exactly JOHN FENTON I am a wine-merchant in Mark-lane in the City I have an account at Glyn and Co s—I know nothing of either of the prisoners—this check is not my hand-writing and I know nothing about it—it is very like my signature—I think I could detect the difference myself but it is a very close imitation—I have never seen this check-book before it is not one of mine—I find my own name on some of the checks—I know nothing about it—this letter looking at one reached me by the post it is signed Charles Smith —I do not know any such person—I sent an answer the following day the 16th of June—I signed the letter John Fenton in the same way that I sign checks—I directed the letter to Mr Smith The letter produced was an inquiry respecting a vessel called the Henrietta and requested the reply to be forwarded to Charles Smith 7 Wormwood-street Cross-examined by MR EVANS Q Do you know whose writing the check is A I do not—I expressed my belief about it at the Mansion-house—it is very similar to the writing of a clerk who was in my employment—that was my opinion—my belief is shaken from circumstances that have happened since MR BODKIN Q There is a similarity in that writing to the writing of a clerk of your A Yes—his name is Hubbard—I have seen him here to-day—that similarity induced me at first to suspect him of being the writer of it—my present belief is that he is innocent—my answer to the letter simply stated that I knew nothing of the vessel the writer inquired after HENRY HUBBARD I was clerk to Mr Fenton—I left him on the 22nd of June last in consequence of this affair COURT Q Were you discharged A I was taken into custody on suspicion on the 22nd of June—I have not yet returned to the employment—my employer did not direct me to be taken into custody—I believe it was the backers—I have not applied to be taken back but I expect to return in the course of a few days—I know nothing of the check THOMAS CRAFFORD I keep a coffee-house at No 7 Wormwood-street Bishopsgate I know the prisoner Hayward—I never knew him by any name until he asked me if he might have a letter directed to him at my house in the name of Charles Smith—I am not positive when that was—I think it was the latter end of May or the beginning of June—it might be somewhere about June—there was a letter came directed to Charles Smith—it was given to him by one of my servants—I saw it given to him—I told her to give it to him Cross-examined Q In what month was that A Either the latter end of May or the beginning of June I am not certain which—I am not positive it was not in May MR PARNELL Q Did you take in more than one letter at your house directed to him A Never since I have been there MR EVANS Q You are in the habit of taking in letters of this kind are you not A For lodgers that I have staying with me—the number of lodgers I have varies—mine is a large house—I let sixteen beds—I have occupied the house fourteen months—I have occasionally a good many lodgers and sometimes only three or four—I never had one of the name of Smith that I know of—I never before had letters directed there to parties who did not reside there—I have had one since for a gentleman named Dixon a traveler to Mr Christy a grocer in Whitechapel—I am not positive when this was it might have been the latter end of May or the beginning of June COURT Q Was it late as the end of June A No I am certain of that ROBERT KENYON I am clerk to Mr Patteson and was so while the prisoner Hayward was in his employment—I cannot swear that this letter is the prisoner s writing COURT Q You cannot form a belief upon it A I cannot Cross-examined by MR EVANS Q Just look at the check can you say whose writing that is A The figures 19 and 47 are precisely like the prisoner s writing—I cannot say as to the writing—the writing appears to be different—it does not appear to be written by the same hand—I cannot answer as to the figures being ordinary clerk s figures—people make figures differently—I do not think that clerks who are in the habit of writing make figures very much alike COURT Q Have you looked at the figures in the amount A Yes they seem to have been written by the same hand—they are very similar to Hayward s figures—I have my doubts about the writing in the body of the check—it is quite different—I should say the figures were Hayward s writing and the body of the check not—according to my judgment the body of the check is not his writing and that leads me to doubt whether the figures are his although they are very much like his WILLIAM BACE I am clerk to Messrs Bush and Mullens the solicitors for the prosecution I served the prisoner Hayward personally on the morning of the 23rd with a notice of which this is a copy This was a notice to produce the answer of Mr Fenton I also served a copy of it on his attorney The letter was not produced JOHN ROWLEY I am employed in the East-India Dock Company s warehouse in Crutched-friars I also act in the evening as check-taker at the Pavilion theatre—I know Hayward and I know Alexander by sight—I remember seeing Hayward on the 21st of June last at the Mulberry Tree Stepney-green—there was a publican s ball there and therefore I know it was on that day—I was there after being at the Pavilion Theatre—I saw Hayward in the ball-room—I was there as one of the company and he also—we left the ball about half-past twelve o clock—he wished me to sleep with him that night and I slept at the coffee-shop—he said he had got a 50l note three sovereigns and some silver about him and he had a gold watch and chain—he said he had given eighteen guineas for the watch—I had known him before by coming backwards and forwards to the Pavilion—I did not see the note I saw the purse—he had the note inside the purse—there was one note I could not tell whether it was a 50l note or not—I saw no appearance o a note but he told me had it—the next morning I went home and got my breakfast came back and went with him to Rotherhithe—I dined with him there—he paid for the dinner—he put his purse on the table and said he had got a 50l note there and some sovereigns—some time after that I think on a Saturday morning about the middle of July about the 17th I saw him again at the corner of the New-road White chapel—he wished me to go with him to the other end of the town—I went to the post-office at Charing-cross at the corner of Trafalgar-square he there gave me a 50l note and asked me if I would be so good as to get 1l worth of postage stamps for his brother—I said Mr Hayward what name must I put on the note your name or mine —he said You can put any name you think proper —he told me to put Spring-gardens as the address or some place in the neighbourhood—I do not know whether that is near the post-office or not—I went to the post-office and presented the note and the gentleman said he could not give me change for a 50l note and gave it me back—Hayward was about twenty minutes before he came back—I gave him the note back—I went with him afterwards towards the Bank towards home Mile End way—he did not say anything more then—I did not get the change—he said it was of no consequence he would borrow 2l or 3l of Charlie—I told him he could get change at the Bank if he thought proper—I merely looked at the note and shut it up again—I had no suspicion that it was a bad one—I just gave it to the clerk at the post-office he looked at it saw the amount and gave it me back—he did not object to it as not being a Bank-note I did not notice anything on the note—I noticed that it was rather a dirtyish note— looking at one —this one is not the right note— looking at another —I can almost swear that this is the one—I saw some writing that looked like that at the top—I am not a good scholar and cannot tell what that writing is but it was like that—I have seen Hayward several times at the theatre—I have known him for the last four months coming backwards and forwards—this boy Constable was the call-boy of the theatre—I have seen him in Hayward s company several times—I have seen Hayward and Alexander together I should say about three or four times within the last four months more frequently within the last six weeks—I never saw them all three together—I have seen Hayward and Constable together but never Alexander and Constable—I have frequently met Hayward and Constable together going to have something to drink—I have met them at the top of the Minories going to have some ale and I have had a drop of ale with them sometimes—I have seen them very late together Cross-examined by MR ECANS Q Did you know Hayward before the ball A Yes two or three months before that he was backwards and forwards at the theatre passing through into the pit—we did not go together to the ball—I cannot leave till the theatre is nearly over—I happened to meet him at eleven o clock and went over to the ball afterwards—we slept together that night—I am married—I left orders that I was not coming home that night because I know I could not without keeping my wife up very late—the ball was not over till half-past twelve then I had to walk all the way to Aldgate—Hayward wished to speak to me and that made me stop—I dined with him next day—he paid for the dinner—there was nothing at all extraordinary in that—I have often had gentlemen treat me to dinners—I saw his purse laid down with a note in it and I likewise noticed a sovereign and some silver—it was a steel purse—it was a 50l Bank of England note that I presented at the post-office—I could read 50l —I can read very little—I can put my own name but I am not scholar enough to read off-hand or read old English—I gave no evidence at the police-office—I have never been examined publicly before with reference to this transaction—I do not know the name of the clerk at the post-office—I have not seen him here to-day—I merely handed the note in at the box—my mistress was the only person to whom I named this—I might have named it to one or two—I mentioned it to nobody else that I know of except the police—I mentioned it to them the very same night—I named it to the solicitor I gave him all the particulars—that was about a week ago Cross-examined by MR METCALF Q When did you first see Alexander with Hayward A About two months ago—I passed them together—I have seen them backwards and forwards for the last six weeks several times before and several times afterwards but not before two months ago COURT Q Have you often seen Constable in company with Hayward A Yes very often about a dozen times or so in the course of the last two months—I did not meet Alexander at the ball SUSANNAH LOUISA REEVE HERBERT I am the wife of William Herbert a tailor—he left this country on the 7th of Aug —he was here in July—he was then anxious to dispose of a general business which he was carrying on at No 1 Boswell-court Devonshire-street Queen-square—he employed a person named Morley as his agent The prisoner Alexander came on the 26th of July and said his name was William Hammond—I heard him say his name was Hammond—he said he came from Mr Morley and he came to buy the business—he said he would take it—he was to give 35l for the business and the shop fixtures—I have a copy of the list of fixtures that we gave to him—he paid the deposit 8l out of a 50l note—this is the note—he was to come again and settle it on Friday the 30th of July—he gave the note to my husband and he wrote on it Mr Herbert Boswell-court Queen-square —I did not see him write it but this is my husband s name and I believe it to be his writing—I saw it was a 50l note—my husband had not got change and he went to Mrs Cover to get change—he came back with change—I was present all the time he was away—he gave Alexander the full amount—he gave him 45l in notes and 5l in gold and he gave my husband a 5l note and two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns—Mrs Cover come over asked the prisoner for his address and he gave William Hammond 11 Baldwin-street City-road —that was at the same time that the change was brought—Mrs Cover came to see who the person was that had brought the note to my husband and he gave that address—I saw him give it to her—he never came again—I afterwards saw him in the pit at the Pavilion Theatre—I do not recollect whether Hayward was with him Cross-examined by MR METCALF Q Did you ever see him before he came to inquire about the purchase A No and never since except on this one occasion at the theatre—he called twice at my shop—the first time he called to look at it and said he had come from Mr Morley and the second time he came to bring the note—I can identify him as the man by his appearance and he wrote that address which Mrs Cover received from him and she identifies the same man COURT Q Look at the prisoner and say from your own recollection whether he is the man or not A Yes he is—I recollect his person MR METCALF Q What was the deposit first proposed A He said I will give you 5l if that will do —I said Yes it will do and after the change was given he said I may as well leave you 8l I shall have less to pay on Friday and he left 8l —my husband has gone to America—I saw him sail in the ship Quebec bound for New York—I told the prisoner when he came that we were in contemplation of going and in consequence of his not purchasing the business I am left to dispose of it MR BODKIN Q I believe you are waiting here till the trial is over A Yes—I shall follow my husband directly I receive his first letter if he writes for me ANN COVER My husband keeps a public-house opposite Mrs Herbert s I remember Mr Herbert s coming over with 50l note for change—my husband was up stairs at the time—he came down directly after just as Mr Herbert was taking the change off my counter—in consequence of something he told me I went over to Mr Herbert to make some further inquiry about the note—I found Mrs Herbert there—Mr Herbert was not there when I first got there—there was a dark young man talking to Mrs Herbert it was Alexander—I am quite positive of him—I did not know his name then—I have heard it since—I went and asked him his address because my husband said I was wrong in taking the 50l note—I had the 50l note in my possession then—Mr Herbert had the change—I did not see him give it to the prisoner—I saw it lying on the table and he was there sitting down on the table—I asked him for his address and he wrote this in my presence as his address read William Hammond 11 Baldwin-street City-road —I left the prisoner there—I saw him again at the Pavilion Theatre with a lot more the pit was full—Mr Forrester took me there—I should say that was three weeks or a month afterwards—I had never seen him on any but these two occasions Cross-examined by MR METCALF Q Did you see him write this A Yes—I waited while he wrote it—Mr Herbert had left the pen and ink there—I saw him put his pen to the paper—he said he was a very bad writer—I am positive of that—I am quite satisfied that the prisoner is the man THOMAS CAPES I am a saddler working with my father I have known the prisoners about five months—I have known Hayward the longest—I have not been much with them—I have seen them together often—I have seen there with Constable several times at the theater in Whitechapel and about there—I recollect being with Hayward at the end of June and having some brandy and water with him—he then said that his grandfather had made him a present of 200l —he showed me about 70l at that time a 50l note and the remainder in gold—the money was in a bag and the note in a purse—he did not talk at that time of what he was going to de in business—he was not then in employment I do not know whether Alexander was—it was before then that I went with him to the Isle of Wight—I recollect about three months ago in the evening being with Alexander and Hayward and two others named East and Penny in Baker s-row—that was before we went to the Isle of Wight—I have known Forrester the officer by sight for two or three months—I mentioned the name of Forrester to them it was about a week after we returned from the Isle of Wight—I said Have you seen Forrester the officer looking about Hayward was standing a short distance off and Alexander was there—they passed it off in a sort of joke they did not say much—I said it to Alexander and the two young men who were with him they were coopers—I said Have you seen Forrester looking about —I had not really seen him—I merely asked them that—upon that Alexander gave the two gents a bit of a nudge and a laugh as much as to say Do you say a word and it was all peace and quietness in consequence—I went away and left them standing there—I saw Hayward again the same night—he said Have you seen Forrester looking about —I said No I have not —he said You must have seen him or you would not have said anything about such a thing or something like that—he told me he had got into a mess and he did not know which way to get out of it—he said If the question is put to you whether you have seen me with a gold watch or a large sum of money be sure and say no say you never saw me with more than a few shillings —he did not mentioned anybody that was likely to put that question—I said Well perhaps you will have no objection to tell me what this mess is —he said No I would rather you would ask me for 5l —Alexander came up at the time and Hayward told him he would speak to him in a moment—the last words he said Be sure you do not say a word or I shall be lost for ever —Alexander could hear that quite well—he was not standing more than two yards off—after they went away together Cross-examined by MR EVANS Q When was it that Hayward told you he had received 200l from his grandfather A About from the 5th to the 15th of June or the 16th or the 20th I am not certain to a day—I do not know what day of the month it was—we started for the Isle of Wight on the 27th of June and it was a week before that—I have always made that statement—we were a week at the Isle of Wight—the conversation about Forrester took place about a week after we returned—I had not seen Forrester before I said that—I thought if I could hear anything by saying that I should—that was all the reason I had for putting the question—if there was anything to be heard I thought it would be as good a question to put to them as any—I only heard what I have just now stated Q What was this about the nudge A As they were all standing together I came up and said Have you seen Forrester and Alexander gave a nudge with his elbow and a wink as much as to say Don t say a word —I think I mentioned the wink before—they did not say a word—it was intended to keep their tongues still I supposed—the conversation I had with him was not by a nudge or a wink—he told it me in so many words—it was about a week after we returned form the Isle of Wight about eleven o clock at night opposite my father residence—I spent about 5l on that trip—I received no money from Hayward and no presents—I did not receive a pair of boots from him as a present—I bought a pair of boots—I swear he did not pay for them—he spent about 12l —he bought a new coat two or three riding whips and also some presents to send to his young lady and one thing and another I do not know what he spent—we spent out riding—we had a horse and chaise for three days—we paid for that between us—it was 10s a day—I paid 15s —we lived at different hotels—I do not know what I spent—taking one day with another I spent about 8s or 10s a day—those were my own expenses—we were not all the time in the Isle of Wight—we were away a week we left London on the Saturday and returned on the next Monday week—of course we had eatables and drinkables we could not do without and a bed—my expenses only came to 8s or 10s a day—we travelled by the third-class—he spent more than me because at the time we were at the hotel be wanted things that I did not care about—I do not know in whose writing this check is—I have seen Hayward write several times and know his writing—I have seen a check-book in his possession but not of this nature not from the same bankers—I cannot swear that this is the one— looking at the one produced —the book that was in his possession had two short names which I mentioned to Mr Bace the clerk of Bush and Mullen s when I first went there—the first names was John —I can swear that—I saw that book about the 10th of July Cross-examined by MR METCALF Q Who was the nudge and wink intended for A For the two coopers not for Hayward—he was standing there COURT Q When did you see Hayward with a book like that in his possession A At the Pavilion Theatre—it was hanging nearly out of his pocket—I took it out thinking he night lose it I turned over a leaf or two and he turned round and snatched it away—that was about the 10th of July after we returned from the Isle of Wight I saw the name I just turned over one or two of the leaves and I observed there was a signature in the book the Christian name was John and the other was a short name—I did not notice the banker s name —I did not ask him what it was—he did not ask me for it he snatched it away from me—he appeared quite offended—he made no observation but walked out of the theatre soon after—that was after the time of the conversation I spoke of with a nudge and wink—it was after he told me he had got into a mess—we had not gone to the theatre together I do not think we ever did but we have met there occasionally—I saw him occasionally after he said he had got into a mess we were good friends nothing had led me to avoid his company I still associated with him—I never heard that he had a banker—I do not recollect what the name of the banker on the leaves of the check-book was—I was very much surprised to find him in possession of a check-book—I did not make any communication about it I kept it a quiet as I could I thought I might find out something more that was my reason—I first left off keeping it quiet about a month back—I did not keep it quiet till Hayward was in custody—I stated it between a fortnight and a week before he was taken—I made that communication to Mr Bush s clerk having seen a reward advertised in the paper I went to them knowing they were gents that prosecute and told all I know—the reward did not relate to this prosecution but to a forgery in the country MR BODKIN Q Did you see that advertisement in a newspaper or against a wall A In a newspaper—I learnt from that that Bush and Mullens were solicitors to the Banker s Association and I went to their office—when this use was made of Forrester s name I was in the street passing the Pavilion Theatre—it was at night—I had not seen Forrester—I had no reason to believe Forrester was looking for him—it was an invention of my own because I suspected him—I made inquiries about his grandfather of every one I thought was likely to know they said he had a grandfather but he was a very poor man ISABELLA HAYWARD I am the mother of the prisoner Hayward At the time this occurred he lived at home with me at No 4 Hope-place Stepney—I remember Forrester coming there—I showed him my son s bed-room—there were some drawers which he opened with a key that he brought—the prisoner has a grandfather living at Scarborough—he has been a ship-builder—he now has a small pension Cross-examined by MR EVANS Q Where were the drawers A In the front parlour—the lower drawer was in my son s possession—he kept books and papers in it—I do not know where his grandfather is at the present time—no inquiry has been made—I have not seen him for some time—I have seen him since my son was taken into custody—the other drawers were locked—his brothers had the key—he has two brothers both older than him—they live and sleep at home—they all have access to these drawers MR BODKIN Q Do you remember Forrester bringing a key with him A Yes—I believe it opened the lower drawer—that was my son s drawer—I was not in the room at the time—the grandfather s pension is about 10l a year—he has expectations of possessing property—I do not know exactly what the expectations are DANIEL FORRESTER I took the prisoner Hayward into custody at the corner of Court-street Whitechapel—Alexander and the lad Constable were with him—I had had my attention drawn to them for some length of time before that day more particularly to Hayward—I had seen Alexander—I cannot say he was in his company with Hayward he was near to him—I had reason to think so but I cannot say because I was at a distance off at the theatre—I have seen Constable in company with Hayward frequently—on taking him into custody I searched him—I found a bunch of keys and these papers on him—I went to his mother s house and opened the lower drawer of a chest of drawers in the lower room—it was locked I opened it with a key which I found on him—I produce some things which I found in that drawer—I found this sheet of blotting-paper—on holding it up to the light the reverse way I can make out the words John Fenton —it is now in the same condition as when I found it—I have compared it with the check said to be forged—it does not correspond with the impression on that blotting paper—I believe they are not the same—it is not impression of the forged one—I have not compared it with all the checks—I took Alexander in to cus-tody at the same time I took Hayward—there was another officer with me—I took hold of both their arms and popped them both into a cab as soon as I could—Hayward asked me what I took him for and I told him he was charged with uttering a forged check on Jones Loyd and Co for 89l odd about the middle of March or something to that effect—he made no reply—I said nothing more at that time—he asked me a question or two to which I did not give him any answer—I think he asked me what the other officer s name was or something of that sort—I did not tell Alexander at that time what he was charged with—at the Mansion-house I told him he was charged with passing a 50l note in taking a shop in New North-street Queen-square of a person named Herbert—he said he knew nothing about it he had never had a 50l note—I received this address W Hammond No 11 Baldwin-street City-road —I made inquiries at the place and found no such person known there Cross-examined by MR EVANS Q The papers you handed to me are what you found in the drawer A No—on the prisoner Hayward s person among the rest I found a 50l note of the Bank of Elegance—I found these papers and letters on his person—I took the key from him—I took him into custody in Whitechapel-road Cross-examined by MR METCALF Q What did you find on Alexander A Nothing that I kept from him—I do not think he had much on him—I searched his lodging and brought away two duplicates that was all—they had nothing to do this case ANN COVER re-examined I should know the 50l note again by my husband s writing—I saw him write on it and likewise Mr Herbert at my bar—this is it looking at it —my husband s initials J C are under Mr Herbert s name—he wrote Mr Herbert s name as well in the corner JOHN ROWLEY re-examined I recognize the note by black ink-mark— looking at one —this is not the note looking at another this is the note with the writing at the top Francis Hayward the prisoner s father No 4 Hope-place Stepney and William Hughes of No 1 William-street Commercial-road gave the prisoner Hayward a good character Alexander also received a good character HAYWARD— GUILTY Aged 19 — Transported for life ALEXANDER—

t18471025-2484  2484 CHARLES CROMWELL HICKS was indicted for feloniously and knowingly uttering a forged warrant for the payment of 7l 10s with intent to defraud Robert Simpson MR PRENDERGAST conducted the Prosecution ROBERT SIMPSON I am a baker in the Walworth-road On Monday the 6th of Sept the prisoner came and asked me to change this check— produced —it is for 7l 10s —he said 3l 10s would do—I had known him for two months—I asked him why he had not got it changed—he said it was too late and he was very much in want of the money—it was about six o clock in the evening—I asked who he had it from—he pointed to the check and said That gentleman is my uncle he is a rich old fellow with about 200 000l if you were to see him in the street you would think he was not worth 200 pence and if he were to see me in the street he would say there is a penny for you and be off with you — check read— London Sept 8th 1847 On demand pay bearer 7l 10s placing the same to the account of R Hicks Esq and believe me your obedient servant C Hicks To S Pratt Esq Messrs Vacher and Sons Parliamentary Agents 39 Parliament-street Whitehall —I could not see which name he pointed to when he spoke about the rich uncle—I pointed to the name of Pratt and asked who he was—he said he was a Parliamentary agent—I let him have 3l 10s —he said I suppose I must put my name on the back of the check —he put this on it—this is it—it looks like H Hicks —he said nothing when he wrote it—he gave it to me and said I might either pay it away or he would give me the money next day—he did not come next day—I sent my wife with a message—she returned with the check—in consequence of that I went to the prisoner s lodging—I was his baker—I did not find him till the Thursday following—I then told him there were no effects to the check and I must give him into custody—he said I did he was a ruined man but he could not be worse off than what he was it would be a charity to do it—I gave him in charge Prisoner Q What was the state of the light when I endorsed it A It was perfectly daylight—I am quite sure you said uncle and not father —I saw your wife at your lodging—it did not rain all day the day after—I did not purpose to you to give security after giving you in charge in my own shop and say that would answer my purpose just as well—the man who accompanied me to the station was not a policeman—he is not here COURT Q Do you recollect what words you made use of when he asked you to give him the money on the check A No but I am quite sure I asked him where he got the check from THOMAS PRATT I am an army agent at 35 King-street Westminster—I lived at 29 Parliament-street at Messrs Vacher and Sons many years and left three years ago—I had chambers there—I never saw the prisoner but twice before—I knew his father very well—he died three weeks ago—I kept his accounts for many years—his name was Raymond Hicks—he was as officer in the army and I received his pay as an agent—I never knew of the prisoner s having an uncle—I had an account of the father in Sept —I had no instructions to pay anything to the account of C Hicks or J H Hicks—I do not know whose writing this check is it is not the prisoner s father s—in the spring of this year the prisoner called on me to inquire after his father s health—I think that was the first time I saw him—I do not think I have ever paid any money to him on his father s account—this check was offered to me and I returned it Prisoner Q Were you my father s agent in 1831 A No Mr Vacher was—I lived there at that time—I am not aware of a sum of money being paid to your father s account at the decrease of a half-sister Miss Harriet Hicks about that time—I do not think that four checks for 60l 40l 15l and 10l passed through Mr Vacher s books at that period by a letter of advice of your drawing—I was told at that time this check was written your father was very ill—I heard that he was not in a condition to have written—I did not see him—I believe he died a few days after you were taken in charge—I am not aware that Mrs Hicks afterwards paid the amount to this cheek JOHN MAY policeman V 281 Mr Simpson gave the prisoner into my charge—he said I will willingly go —on the way to the station he was I should do him justice to take a rope and tie him up to the lamp-post for he was in great distress and he and his wife had had nothing to eat nut bread and water for the last fortnight—he said I received the 3l 10l of Mr Simpson with a view that I should be able to pay it again in two or three days but not being able to realize sufficient money from a book which I am publishing this is the result THOMAS JOHN KING I live in Lothbury I have known the prisoner three years and have seen him write several times—to the best of my belief this instrument is in writing The prisoner in a long address stated that he had been reduced from affluence to great distress and had been compelled to support himself as an author that he wrote the order in question to obtain a sum of money to complete and print a work which he had translated and which was patronized by many eminent persons but that t was drawn upon his father who owed him 10l and not upon his uncle GUILTY Aged 52 —Strongly recommended to mercy by the Jury Transported for Sven Years

his intent to be to defraud Thomas Rance the surviving executor of Elizabeth Griffith deceased MR CLARKSON and SIR J BAYLEY conducted the Prosecution ABEL CLIFTON I am one of the principal clerks in the office of the Three per Cent Reduced Bank of England—I produce a true copy of the account in the Bank books of the stock of Elizabeth Griffith deceased—I copied it myself from the books—on 11th Nov 1828 the amount of stock standing in her name was 4 000l 0s 6d —the next amount after that had been reduced is 3 300l 0s 6d on 11th Oct 1841—381l 15s 9d was transferred on that day leaving 2918l 4s 9d —Thomas Rance as the executor of Elizabeth Griffith was entitled to receive the dividends on that amount after 11th Oct 1841—I presume there was a dividend due on that stock on 11th Oct last but that is not my department—the amount has remained the same to the present time and whatever dividend was due on it Thomas Rance as surviving executor was entitled to receive RICHARD BREADY I produce a certificate of the burial of Elizabeth Griffith—I compared it with the original in the parish of Chelmsford—it is a correct copy— This being read certified that Elizabeth Griffith of Duke-street aged 60 was buried on 5th Aug 1830 —Signed J Hutchinson officiating Minister —I also produce a certificate of the burial of John Rance which I have examined with the original at the parish of Great Baddow in Essex— This certified the burial of John Rance of Hatfield Peveril Dec 21st 1830 aged 62 HENRY ROBERT HOWARD I am a clerk in the Bishop of London s office Doctors Commons I produce from the Consistorial Court of the Bishop the original will of Elizabeth Griffith and also the register-book of the Court for the Diocese of London containing the entries of wills and the acts of the Court—this is the entry in the register— reads The will of Elizabeth Griffith was proved at London 22nd Dec 1830 before the worshipful the Judge by the oath of Thomas and John Rance brothers of the deceased the executors to whom administration was granted The will of Elizabeth Griffith was here read dated 19th Nov 1829 After dividing her furniture plate &c between her niece Jane Rance and her daughter Elizabeth Mary Phipps it conveyed the residue of her personal estate on trust to her brothers Thomas and John Rance to be invested in stock the interest of the same to be paid to her said daughter E M Phipps during her life and after her death the principal to be divided amongst her children JOHN LEWIS I am a clerk in the Consol-office at the Bank of England—I give out warrants for the dividends on the three per cent reduced On 21st Oct I was applied to for a dividend warrant payable on some stock standing in the name of Elizabeth Griffith deceased—this is the warrant I gave out— looking at one —the person who made the application gave a proper description of the stock and the amount of the dividend—he stated that he was the executor Thomas Rance and I gave him the warrant—he signed Thomas Rance to the bottom of it in my presence—I produced to him the dividend receipt-book which I have here—he signed Thomas Rance to that in my presence Prisoner Q Can you swear that I am the person who applied for the dividend warrant A No I cannot tell whether you are the person or not so many hundreds and thousands come for dividend warrants The warrant was here read It was for 42l 9s 11d after deducting the income-tax due on 10th Oct 1847 on the before-mentioned stock signed Thomas Rance The entry in the dividend receipt-book was also signed Thomas Rance THOMAS RAIKE I am a clerk in the Dividend Pay-office at the Bank of England I produce the pay-book containing an account of the money I paid in cashing dividend warrants on 21st Oct last—42l 9s 11d was paid by me on that day to the bearer of this warrant in two 5l notes Nos 36681 and 36682 dated 14th Sept 1847 and 32l 9s 11d in cash—this looking at a note No 36682 is one of those notes Prisoner Q Will you swear I was the person who came with the warrant A I can not THOMAS RANCE I live at Hatfield Peveril near Chelmsford in Essex ✗ and am one of the brothers of the late Elizabeth Griffith—I had a brother named John in her lifetime—my sister lived at Chelmsford she died on 29th July 1830 and was buried there—she left a daughter Elizabeth Mary surviving her who was married at the time her mother died to George Phipps the prisoner—my sister was a widow when she died—my brother died on 15th Dec 1830—at the time of my sister s death the prisoner lived at Enfield in Middlesex and carried on business as a saddler and harness-maker there—I and my brother John were the executors of my sister s will—I have no recollection of proving the will—I cannot recognize my sister s writing at the bottom of this will— looking at it —I think it is hers—when she died she had 3 300l 0s 6d in the three per cent reduced—on the 28th Nov 1831 I as surviving executor gave the prisoner a letter of attorney to receive the dividends—this is it produced —it is my writing—it was to save the trouble and expense of my coming to town—I cancelled that when the prisoner became insolvent and from that time down to April in the present year I received the half-yearly dividends— referring to the letter of attorney —the date of the canceling of this is 18th Oct 1837—I request here that no further act may be done by this power—the prisoner knew that I cancelled it at that time and I continued from that time always to receive the dividends down to April last—I received this letter on 6th Nov 1838— produced —I believe these signatures are those of the prisoner and his wife Elizabeth Mary Phipps—my daughter Louisa was in the habit of transacting my correspondence at that time—the prisoner knew that—she used to write for me to him and receive letters from him— This was directed to Miss Rance Swan Inn Hatfield Peveril dated 22nd Oct 1838 signed by Robert Mattheson the assignee under the prisoner s bankruptcy also by the prisoner and his wife directing the interest of his said wife in the stock in question to be paid to Luke Addington Esq he having purchased her interest in the same and declaring his receipt to be a sufficient authority for the said payments —in consequence of that ntoice I afterwards when I received the half-yearly dividends paid them over to Mr Luke Addington who banked at Coutts and Co s—I paid them to Messrs Coutts on his account up to last April—I have the receipts—I do not exactly know when Mr Addington died but after his death I paid the dividends to Samuel Addington his executor—in 1841 the prisoner applied to me for the sale of 300l a portion of the stock which he represented to have paid on account of the deceased s estate—I took the opinion of my attorney and afterwards of counsel as to my right to do so—I afterwards sold as much of the 3 200l 0s 6d as would repay the prisoner the sum he had advanced—that left 2 918l 4s 9d the sum now standing in the Bank books the half-yearly dividend on which after the payment of the property tax was 42l 9s 11d —I received that dividend in April last—on 26th Oct last I applied for another half-yearly dividend then due and found it had been paid—I did not sign this Thomas Rance to this dividend warrant nor this Thomas Rance to the book—I did not authorize the prisoner or anybody else to go and receive that dividend for me—I did not know it had been received before I went on 26th Oct and found somebody had been there before me—I never had the probate of my sister s will in my possession—my brother John lived with me at Hatfield Peveril—he was buried at Great Baddow near Chelmsford—he was then in his sixty-third year—I was at his funeral Prisoner Q Can you swear you never gave me authority to receive the dividends A Never—I did grant you a power of attorney—I have explained the reason why I withdrew it—I believe I wrote to you in 1837 for you and your wife to meet me in London on a certain day—you met me in London but not on the day appointed I think—I do not recollect your having some business to transact with a gentleman at the west-end—you promised me that you would not receive the dividends—I cannot recollect which dividend it was you received contrary to your promise but I think it was the April one—I went down to Enfield a day or two after and you told me you had taken the dividend—I do recollect the exact words you used—I do not recollect that you told me the reason you received it was because a gentleman came into the City to meet you your wife and me and as I did not come you settled the account with him—you did not show me the receipt that I recollect—I was angry because you took it—you had had an order from the assignees not to receive it—I had received an order to pay the dividend to assignee under your insolvency—before that time you received the dividends SAMUEL WEYMOUTH HOPWOOD I am a clerk in the office of Messrs Hopwood and Co solicitors of Chancery-lane who are the solicitors to the executors of Mr Luke Addington—I produce a deed of assignment dated 1st Aug 1838—I am not the attesting witness Prisoner Q Is that deed signed by myself and Mrs Phipps A I cannot prove that your names appear there WILLIAM MITCHELL In 1838 I was in the office of Mr Lucena and am the attesting witness to this deed—I saw it executed by the prisoner Elizabeth Mary his wife Prisoner Q Did you hear it read over to me and Mrs Phipps A I cannot remember that—I cannot remember that you made any observation at the time—I cannot remember Mr Matheson the assignee or Mr Lucena being there present when it was read This being read was a deed dated 1st Aug 1838 by which the interest of Elizabeth Mary Phipps in the stock in question from 10th Oct 1837 ✗ assigned absolutely to Luke Addington in consideration of the sum of 298l MICHALE WHALE I am shopman to Mr Oliver a boot and shoemaker of 108 Bishopsgate-street without—I have known the prisoner twelve ✗ eighteen months—I learnt from him that he was a saddler and herness maker—I did not know where he liver until this transaction—on 18th Oct last he came and purchased a pair of boots at 6s 3d —he did not pay for them on that occasion—he came again on the following Thursday the 21st and bought two pairs of children s boots at 6s 0 1/2d making 12s 3d —he said he would pay me and asked if I could give him change for a 5l note—I gave him 3l in gold and the remainder in silver—he produced a 5l note—I did not then know his name and asked him and he gave me the name of Wilson of Enfield—this is the note No 36682 —the writing Wilson Enfield on the back of it is my own—I wrote it in the prisoner s presence—I went to Enfield on 29th Oct in company with the two Forresters and there saw the prisoner in his shop at work—I recognized him as soon as I saw him and he did me—I merely paid him the compliments of the morning and he recognized me by the name of Oliver not knowing that I was not Mr Oliver—Forrester asked me in the prisoner s presence whether that was the gentleman and I said it was—Forrester said he had called respecting a 5l note and asked if he had changed a note lately—he said Yes on last Thursday —Forrester said Do you mean yesterday —he said No I mean yesterday week this being on Friday morning—he said Did you change it with the gentleman pointing to me—he said Yes I did —Forrester than asked where he had got the note from—he said he had it of a Mr Emery—Forrester asked Where at Enfield —he said No in the Liverpool-road Islington—Forrester asked how he came to put the name of Wilson on the back of it—he said Mr Emery told him to put the name of Wilson on the if he was asked any questions—Forrester said You must go along with me to Mr Emery and I the prisoner and the two Forresters went to Mr Emery together Prisoner Q Will you swear you asked me my name or the name you should put on the note A I asked you what was your name and when was your address—I swear this is the note you gave me DANIEL FORRESTER I am one of the officers attached to the Mansion-house On Friday 29th Oct I went with my brother and Whale to Enfield and saw the prisoner sitting in his shop there—we went in and I said to the prisoner I come to ask you some questions respecting a 5l note that you passed about a week since pointing to Whale—he said Yes —I then said Where did you get it —he said I received it from Mr Emery at Islington on last Thursday week as a loan —after a little while he said Is that not satisfactory —I said No not exactly your name being Phipps and you put Wilson on the note —he said that Mr Emery told him that he had received it of a person named Wilson—we then proceeded to Mr Emery s with the prisoner—the prisoner pointed it out in the Liverpool-road I think—we found Mr Emery and I said to him in the prisoner s presence Did you lend the prisoner a 5l note on last Thursday week —he said No never a 5l note nor 10s at one time Prisoner I understand you to say that I said I put any name on the note now I did not put my name to any note Witness I think I said so but I meant that you gave that name JAMES EMERY I live in the Richmond-road Islington—I formerly resided at Enfield twenty-two years and kept a school there—I know the prisoner—I never lent him a 5l note—I have lent him 2s or 3s or a half-crown but never so much as 10s at one time—I never told him I had received a 5l note from Mr Wilson of Enfield—I never paid him a 5l note or 5s Prisoner Q Do you recollect my calling on you on 18th Oct at your school-room when you were packing up A Yes and you asked me to lend you 30s —I did not do it—I told you I was expecting to receive a large sum of money—I did not promise to lend you or your wife the 30s —I never saw you from then till you came to my house in the Richmond-road in custody ANN FOSTER I am the wife of Thomas Foster a baker at Enfield—the prisoner has been in the habit of dealing with us for bread—I keep my husband s books and receive money for him In Oct last the prisoner owed us about 14l —we had made frequent applications to him for payment but had not been able to obtain it up to 22nd Oct last—he had only paid 1l previous to that and that was to Mr Foster not to me—he called on me on 22nd Oct I think and said he had come to pay us some money—I am sure it was after 21st—he paid me 3l he said he did not wish it taken off the bill as he did not wish his wife to know anything about it—I tore a slip of paper out of the book and gave him a receipt for the 3l —he said he had borrowed it—he did not say where—he promised to pay me some more and I think on the following Tuesday he paid me 50s more—he did not state where he got that from—he then said in the presence of myself and husband that we were not to take it off the bill as he did not wish his wife to know anything about it LOUISA RANCE I am the daughter of Thomas Rance of Hatfield Peveril—I generally answer his letters—I have had correspondence of that kind with the prisoner and have received letters from him sometimes addressed to me but generally to my father—by that means I have acquired a perfect knowledge of the general character of his writing—the name Thomas Rance on this warrant and in this receipt-book looking at them to the best of my belief is the prisoner s writing Prisoner Q Will you swear positively that is my writing A I would not swear to any one s unless I saw it written MR CLARKSON Q Have you had a great many letters from him on your father s account A A great many STEPHEN LANCASTER LUCENA I am an attorney at Guildhall-chambers and at Enfield In 1838 I prepared this deed that has been put in—I have not had a great deal of correspondence with the prisoner but I have acquired a knowledge of the character of his writing—I believe the signature to the warrant and in the receipt-book to be his writing Prisoner Q How long is it since you have seen my writing A I think eight years until the other day—I should not like to swear positively that this is your writing—I believe it to be yours—I do not recollect in 1838 bringing a deed to your house to sign in the presence of Mr Mattheson and my clerk—I do not remember reading it over to Mrs Phipps I may have done so—I am not prepared to say where it was executed or whether I was present at its execution—my name is not there as an attesting witness therefore the presumption is that I was not—I have no recollection of Mrs Phipps refusing to sign it on finding it was an absolute sale of her life-interest nor of my taking away the deed and bringing another in ten days which she signed Prisoner In 1837 I became insolvent owing to very severe illness of my wife and family my medical bill being upwards of 200l Mr Lucena was employed by the creditors to oppose me in the Insolvent Court and during the time of my incarceration he went down to Mr Rance stating he was a friend of mine and though he had orders to attend the Court told him he could transact the business for him without his coming up after I came out of prison Mr Addington pitied my case very much and lent me 300l to pay my creditors 10s in the pound they all signed the release which Mr Lucena drew up except Mrs Hughes the creditor for whom he had opposed me who would be paid in full 100l which with 159l the amount of Mr Lucena s bill was paid out of the 300l advanced by Mr Addington Witness A great part of what the prisoner states is right—it is substantially correct except as to my going to Mr Rance—I certainly did go to Mr Rance but it was as solicitor to the assignee—I employed Mr Rance as the trustee under the will to pay the money under the estate—I drew up the release by which the prisoner was discharged by his creditors—my bill was 159l and was paid MR CLARKSON Q Is that account producing one in the prisoner s writing A I should say it was but I have not seen enough of it to go into general matters of account LOUISA RANCE re-examined This account is in the prisoner s writing—I have seen it in his possession—he showed it to me in Sept last when he came down to my father s solicitor— This was a statement of the account existing between the prisoner and Mr Addington containing the payments of the dividends from 5th Sept 1844 down to 5th April 1847 at which time a balance appeared due to Mr Addington of 514l 6s 3 1/2d The prisoner in a very long defence entered into a detailed account of the circumstances connected with his insolvency and the assistance rendered him by Mr Addington stating that the deed signed by himself and wife was supposed to be merely an assignment of her life-interest to Mr Addington and not on absolute sale and that matters had up to the present time remained unsettled between himself and Mr Addington s executors Joshua Nunn leather-cutter of Enfield and Samuel Young gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 47—Recommended to mercy by the

the Prosecution HENRY BARHAM I am clerk to Abraham Wildey Robarts and others Bankers in Lombard-street On 11th Sept last this check for 91l 10s 4d was presented at the counter for payment—I paid it with this 50l and 40l notes and 1l 10s in money—Mr Henry Willis of 37 Old Brosd-street keeps an account there—I do not know the prisoner Prisoner Q Had you any suspicion of the genuineness of that check A None whatever or I should not have paid it—Mr Willis sends many checks to us—I do not know your writing—I thought it was Mr Willis s writing—Mr Willis did not give any waning that there might be forged checks presented CHRISTOPHER HENRY WINDLE I am a clerk in the Issue department of the Bank of England I changed these two notes on 11th Sept —to the best of my recollection this Henry Willis 37 Old Broad-street on the 50l note was on it when I first saw it—we do not pay notes without the name of the presenter is written on them—there is no name on the back of the 40l note—we only require the name on one of a parcel—I gave 50l in gold and a ticket for 40l in notes which was to be taken to anther part of the establishment Prisoner Q What time was it A I should think certainly after twelve o clock MR BODKIN Q That is a mere guess I suppose A Yes it was about was middle of my day s work—it depends upon whether the afternoon s work was heavier than the morning COURT Q Do you go away in the middle of the day A Yes for an hour—no other person takes my book while I am away HENRY WILLIS I am a merchant at 37 Old Broad-street I have an account at Robarts Curits and Co s—the prisoner was in my service as clerk for about ten months and left about 31st Aug last—on that day he said he felt poorly and asked leave to stay away—I usually keep my blank check-book in a private drawer in my own room—the drawer was generally unlicked—he was employed in an adjoining office and had access to my room in the course of his duty—I am acquainted with his writing—these notes are both written by him—they reached me after he had left on account of illness—one is dated Tuesday morning and the other had no date—I received them before 13th Sept when I discovered the forgery— notes read— Hackney Tuesday morning —Dear Sir I am happy to say I am much better and trust to be able to come to the office to-morrow morning I have had two blisters on and am much relieved The bearer my sister-in-law will take any message you have to leave John Byron — Dear Sir The doctor strictly forbids me yet to go out I yesterday experienced a relapse in fever and am now in bed suffering very severely I am to be bled in the arm this morning if I am not better by twelve o clock —the signature is gone—they were thrown into a rubbish-paper drawer and there may have been something gone—this check is not my writing nor was it written by my authority—I knew nothing of it till I found it had been paid—the date and filling-up of it are written by the prisoner-the usual part is printed—the signature I believe to be his writing but I cannot swear that—it is a very good imitation of mine—it is the sort of check I use—it purports to be drawn for duty on tea per Boyne—I always express the subject in my checks—the prisoner would know that—this is the check-book I had in use at that period produced —it is marked to contain 150 checks—I have counted it and find it now contains 146—I miss four—those I used I took from the usual place and left the margin—in those I miss the margin is gone also—I see my name and address written on this 50l note—it is in the undisguised writing of the prisoner—he did not return to my service—I did not see him again till he was in custody in the beginning of January—I had two or three other clerks in my employment at the time Prisoner Q Why do you believe the check to be my writing A From the general character of the writing—the n and y in ninety the p in pounds and the S in Sept all these are attempts at disguise at the same time there are strong marks—there is no similitude between your writing and mine—I swear to the body of the check being your writing—when you were taken ill I most likely said you had better go home till you got sufficiently well to attend to business COURT Q Had any clerk authority to sign checks for you A No I never authorized the prisoner to sign any JAMES GEORGE GARRETT I am clerk to Mr Willis In Sept I went with Mr Bacon another clerk to 8 Miles-lane where the prisoner said he lived—we could not find him—I believe this check to be his writing—I know his writing perfectly—this Henry Willis 37 Old Broad-street on the 50l note is also his writing Prisoner Q Is there any similarity between the writing on the check and that on the note A They do not appear to be alike—I am positive they are both your writing—I do not recollect about a week before you were taken ill Mr Willis coming to the office one morning and stating that he had lost his memorandum-book in which were some blank checks—I generally came about ten o clock—that is later than the rest COURT Q Had you ever gone to the prisoner s lodgings with him A No when he first came he wrote in the address-book 8 Miles-lane as his address—I live near Middlesex Hospital DARCY BACON I am clerk to Mr Willis and live in Camden Town I am perfectly acquainted with the prisoner s writing and believe the body of this clark to be his—I have been a clark there seven or eight years and fellow-clerk with the prisoner probably fifteen months—this writhing on the 50l note is also the prisoner s Prisoner Q Do you recollect one morning about a week before I was taken ill Mr Willis coming to the office and stating that he had lost hims memorandum-book out of his pocket on his way from his own house A No I do not recollect asking if there was anything valuable in it and he saying Nothing but a few blank checks JAMES BRADLEY I am a police-constable of the Mansion-house On 4th Jan I apprehended the the prisoner at Newcastle-upon-type—he was is custody there having been stopped by the electronic telegraph HARRIET LITTLE I am sister to the prisoner s wife In Sept last the prisoner and his wife lived in Miles-lane in the City—my sister went away into the country ona visit to her father and I acted as housekeeper to the prisoner in her absence—during that time be frequently slept out—he said he had been sleeping with the head clerk at Hackney on those occasions—I knew he was Mr Willis s clerk—I took a letter which the prisoner gave me to Mr Willis s—I did not see Mr Willis—I gave it to somebody there—the prisoner gave me the letter in Miles-lane—I saw him write it—it was written with a pencil I believe—it was such a note as this one of those produce —I last saw the prisoner in Miles-lane on Sunday 12th Sept —I know a person named George Atkinson—I heard the prisoner tell him on the saturday that he was going to the Custom-house to pay some duty on Monday morning for his master—at that time he had a small bag in his hand which appeared to contain money—he and Atkinson went that night to Madame Tussaud s exhibition—he left the house on the prisoner s wife still continue to him again till he was in custody—I and the prisoner s wife still continue to live in miles-lane Prisoner Q How many rooms had I there A One—I lived there from the time you took it—you did not make it your residence—you said you lived at Hackney—I asked you what the note was about that I took to Mr Willis—I do not recollect saying to you that it was no use dating it from 8 Miles-lane as you never were there—I did not see you in London after 12th Sept—I was led to believe you were in London after that—I cannot say whether the bag contained silver gold or copper COURT Q How long has the prisoner been married to your sister A Five years—she is older than me—the room in Miles-lane was both a bed-room and sitting-room—I do not live there now—I left two or three months ago not long after the prisoner went away—I lived there with the prisoner and his wife together—there was only one room—the prisoner did not sleep at home then—he has two children—they were there also MR BODKIN Q Are you much younger than your sister A Not much—I was there when my sister went into the country—she was gone a fortnight or three weeks—I took care of the children during that time—while I she was away the prisoner slept in the room twice with his children while I was there Prisoner Q Do you know my writing A Yes I think so—I cannot swear that this check is your writing—I have seen so many different writings of yours—it does not look like your general writing—I think this on the note is more like—I think that is like your general writing HENRY WILLIS re-examined In the summer in the warm weather I lost my card-case as I supposed at Fulham—I do not recollet mentioning that loss in the presence of any of the clerks—I might have done so—I generally kept one blank check in the case sometimes two and cards as well—I cannot say whether I was then using this check-book—I do not recollect when I changed my check-book—the check in the case would probably be an old one because I rarely wanted one for my pocket—the first check in this book was drawn on 18th June 1847—I have my Bank-book sent home to me almost daily—the prisoner was a junior clerk—his salary was 60l —I do not allow my clerks to fill up the body of a check for me to sign—while I was away in May I left several crossed checks with the name of Letch and Co to pay insurances and dated them 8th June and in those the money was filled in by Mr Bacon my principal clerk—in my absence he had authority to do it—I have no partner—Mr Bacon never lived at Hackney Prisoner Q Those crossed checks did not belong to this book A No—I made known the loss of my card-case to the toll-collector on Batterseabridge in crossing over the same day but I do not recollect telling the clerks or asking whether I should advertise it—I did not make my loss known to Messrs Robarts—I live about six miles from my office—I supposed that I lost my card-case in crossing Battersea-bridge MR BODKIN Q Does this check bear any letter and number A Yes A 8316 —that is one of the series from this book—each check-book differs in the letter and number—I have no recollection of when it was I lost the card-case except that it was in the summer The prisoner called ANN BISSETT I remember Saturday 11th Sept —the prisoner was at home ill in bed that day MR BODKIN Q Have you been married to the prisoner A Yes—I was married to him on 31st Jan 1847 MR BODKIN to HARRIET LITTLE Q When was the prisoner married to your sister A Five years ago—I was not present—I saw them go to church and come back—the prisoner was courting her for two years I think—they lived together as man and wife after their marriage—I and my sister were living with our friends—we had no parents living ANN BISSETT re-examined the COURT being of opinion that not being the prisoner s lawful wife her evidence was admissible The prisoner was ill for a fortnight and three days—when he went out on Saturday he said he was going to Madame Tussaud s—I do not recollect exactly the time he went out—it was after dinner—I last saw him before he left London on Sunday morning 12th Sept and I next saw him on 6th Oct —he had been away three weeks and a day—during that time I ascertained that he had another wife—this check is not like his general writing—I do not know this writing nor that on the 50l note—I never saw him write like that to me—he was playing at the Royal Newcastle Theatre when he was taken—we sold off our things in London in order to go—we went to Berwick first—I never saw him with any money—he pledged some things in Whitechapel—he had no money to give me on the Saturday night or Sunday morning MR BODKIN Q Where did you first become acquainted with him A At the City Theatre in Bishopsgate-street—I only went there now and then for pleasure—I went alone and he attended there for pleasure not as an actor—I was acquainted with him eight months before we were married—I first knew he had another wife about three days after he left London—he was so ill on the Saturday that be could not get out of bed till four o clock—he did not come home till a quarter to eleven at night—I did not go with him to Newcastle then—I gave no children by him—the last Sunday we were at Newcastle a policeman called and asked for Mr Mason which was the name we went by—I saw him and he asked me some questions—the prisoner was up stairs at the time but he never asked for him MR BODKIN to HARRIET LITTLE Q What time was it that you saw the prisoner on the Saturday A Between eleven and twelve in the morning—I cannot say the exact time—I received a sovereign from him on the Saturday Prisoner Q How do you know that Saturday was the 11th or 12th Sept A Because I had a letter to write to my sister on the Monday—I am sure of the day The prisoner in a long address entered into an explanation of the circumstances which led to his separation from his first wife and his marriage to Ann Bissett stating that her evidence proved that he being ill in bed on the Satur-day could not have been the person who presented the check or changed the notes that in addition to the fact of Mr Willis s losing his card-case every clerk in the office had access to the drawer in which the check-book was kept and that no writing of his had been produced from the office to compare with the check MR WILLS re-examined I had no tea by the Boyne but I had some hemp—she was a hemp ship from St Petersburgh and the prisoner went down to the Docks about it—I cannot discover the place in the check-book from which the four checks have been taken Prisoner It was my duty to attend to the shipping while I was at Mr Willis s and I recollect the Boyne being one of the ships that I had to attend to GUILTY Aged 24 — Transported for Ten Years

Prosecution GEORGE GOODMAN I am clerk to Isaac George Currie and others bankers of Cornhill On Thursday morning 24th Feb this check signed John Ingle was brought to me for payment by the witness Nicholson—he was detained—Mr John Ingle has an account at our bank JAMES NICHOLSON I am a seaman and live at Church-lane Whitechapel I know the prisoner—I first saw him last Thursday at a public-house in Bishopsgate-street—I might have seen him before about the Minories but never had any conversation with him till Thursday—I went into have a glass of ale—I began to talk about losing a pipe which was stolen from my pocket—the prisoner said Well I came up to London a few days ago and was looking round and some one robbed me of a pocket-book a 5l note and all my characters —he said he had been discharged from his master in Plymouth and he had some up to join another gentleman who was going to Paris but he had disappointed him on account of his having an accident and could not go but he said Never mind I have got a check in my pocket that I received from my master that I have lately left for an amount of wages that was due to me and he was going to take it to the bank that morning—a few minutes after that he asked me if I would please to take it for him—he produced the check—this is it—I looked at it and asked where he had it from—he said he got it from his master in a letter—I took the check to Currie s presented it and was detained—Haydon an officer was sent for—I gave him an account of what I knew about it took him back to the public-house and pointed out the prisoner to him and he and I were taken into custody—I was in custody from Thursday till Monday middle day Prisoner Q Did you not see me on Wednesday and treat me to the play A No—I did not say that another man wrote the check for me and that I could manage it MR BODKIN Q Where were you the night before A In the Minories till about ten o clock then I went to a public-house in Whitechapel and got tipsy—I know I was not in the prisoner s company—I was at a shipping-office in the Minories applying for a ship—it is twenty-five days since I was at sea—I have been trying nine days to get a ship—I have not my register here—it is at the station-house MICHAEL HAYDON City policeman 21 On Thursday 24th Feb I went to Messrs Currie s and there saw Nicholson—I accompanied him to the Black Lion in Bishopsgate-street and there saw the prisoner—Nicholson pointed him out and said That is the man who gave me the check —I said to the prisoner Did you give this man this check showing it him—he said Yes —I asked him from whom he received it—he said From John Ingle of Plymouth —I asked him when—he said On Monday or Tuesday last —it was sent to him by Mr Ingle in a letter—I asked if he had the letter with him—he said No it was at home but he could not tell me where he lived—I told him I must detain him—on the way to the station I took him to Messrs Currie s and to one of the firm he made the same statement he had made to me at the public-house—I then took him to the station-house and found on him a key that opened a box which was pointed out to me by Mr Shelton at his coffee-house in Sparrow-corner Minories—I went there in consequence of inquiries not from any information I received from the prisoner—I found these papers in the box produced —I found a register-ticket on Nicholson Prisoner The box was not locked Witness It was and I opened it by this key—I also locked the box with it but when it was locked a portion of the iron-work was loose and it is quite possible it could be opened without a key THOMAS SHELTON I keep a coffee-house at Sparrow-corner Minories The prisoner lodged there and had a box—I pointed it out to Haydon saw him unlock it and take out some papers—it was the prisoner s box Prisoner Q Did he unlock the box A He moved the bold of the lock with the key—he did not try to see whether it was open first—it might have been opened without the key—the key fitted so as lock or unlock it—I do not know Nicholson—I never saw him at the prisoner s lodging JOHN INGLE I reside at Stonehouse near Plymouth and keep an account at Messrs Currie s Cornhill and have done so thirty years The prisoner was in my employment till the end of Aug 1846 as footman for about nine months—he always passed by the name of Powell—I discharged him—some little time previous to that I was at Cheltenham and there missed some checks from my check-book—I charged the prisoner with having signed a check of mine and discharged him after arriving at Stonehouse—I wrote to my bankers and told them that I had missed checks from my book and in consequence of this I changed the colour of my check-book— looking at one of the papers found in the prisoner s box this is part of a check upon Messrs Harris and Co the Nevy Bank at Plymouth where I also have an account—the part that has my signature has been tore off—this is a cancelled check—I signed my checks on that bank in the same way as my checks on Currie s—this is not my writing looking at the forged check —it was not written by my authority or knowledge—the signature is something like mine but the beginning is not—I never saw the prisoner write—I am not a ship-owner at present—I know nothing of Nicholson— The check being read was dated Feb 18th 1848 for 50l signed John Ingle The part of the check was for 268l A paper also found in the prisoner s box was read on which the name of John Ingle was written several times also the date Feb 18th 1848 and the words five pounds pay to Mr Thompson Prisoner s Defence Mr Ingle did not discharge me I left through illness and since that he has given me a character to get another place I am very sorry for this case I did not do it myself I picked up this piece of paper two years ago I did not know what it meant MR INGLE re-examined I gave him warning to quit directly I came home—since he left me he has been driving a cub—I have not given him a character—last May the captain of the hospital at Plymouth applied to my wife to know what sort of a man he was and she by my direction said he was not a man to be trusted in the house but he would do very well for stables GUILTY

was recommended to me by Mr Jabez Moore of New Bond-street—Mr Moore s name was not then on the note—I told the prisoner I did not know sufficient of him to discount it but if Mr Moore would endorse it I would do so—he came again on 6th Aug —the name of Jabez Moore was than on the note—he stated that Mr Moore was a particular friend of his that he had been under obligations to him and he had got his endorsement—I gave him a check for 26l 15s taking about sixpence in the pound discount—I did not see him again till he was taken into custody—on the day the bill became due a letter was left at my house—I do not know the prisoner s writing—I tried in every way to find him and advertised in every paper in London—he gave his address at 43 Davies-street Berkeley-square when he came to me—I called there and he was not known—I afterwards found he was living at a house in the Regent s-park now occupied by Mr Bodkin—I went these last Oct and he had left—I also wrote a letter to him at Wellington-terrace and received an answer—I apprehended him at a chop-house in Woodstock-street—I told him I came to him about a bill of 27l addressing him as Mr Anderson—he said his name was not Anderson but Williams—I said he certainly was Mr Anderson when I gave him the check for 26l 15s and he must recollect Mr Moore of Bond-street—he said No I know nothing of him —I said Then I must bring some person up who can recognise you more clearly —I called up the policeman who was waiting below and gave him into custody—I am certain he is the man—I took him out of a room where there were twenty other parties Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you know him immediately A Yes—I said Your name is Anderson I think —he said No —I said What is it then —he said My name is Williams or Williamson JABEZ MOORE I live in Bond-street I have known the prisoner many years by the name of Anderson—I did not endorse any promissory note for him in Aug 1846 —the endorsement to this note is not my writing—I never gave him or any other person authority to use my name to this bill in any way—he never asked me for my authority to this bill—I never gave him leave to refer Mr Allen to me nor ever recommended him to Mr Allen Cross-examined Q Have you had business transactions with the prisoner A Yes as a customer twenty years ago—I am a breeches-maker—I have never endorsed bills for him—nor ever authorised him to use my name—I saw him repeatedly about July 1846—I know Mr Allen as a neighbour—the prisoner came to me and asked if I knew whether Mr Allen was in the habit of discounting—I said I did not—he said a gentleman named Platt in Maddox-street had told him that Mr Allen was a great discounter of bills—I said if he was I did not know it—he wanted to get a bill discounted by Mr Allen—I did not see him on the matter afterwards to my recollection—I rather think he told me that Mr Allen would not discount the bill on his credit alone—I did not understand that he wanted me to endorse it—I would not endorse a bill for anybody—I should not think he could have imagined from what I said that I authorised him to use my name—he had not dealt with me for many years—he told me he was in the wine trade—I did not consider myself under any obligation to him at this time—he was always friendly giving friendly advice and so on—I expressed myself very much obliged to him for some services he had performed—it was after that that the conversation took place about Allen s discounting the bill—I never expressed myself so as to lead him to believe that he had my authority to sign my name—I had no idea of anything of the kind—I might have said I should be happy to serve him—I do not know that I did—I was very ill at that time and had been for seven years MR PRENDERGAST Q Did he at any time show you any bill or promissory note A He said he had sold some person a pipe of wine and had got a bill for it—I am quite sure I gave him no authority to use my name—be never asked me—I did not see him after that till he was in custody—I never endorsed a bill for him or he for me—I saw the bill in his hand but not so as to read it—that was at the time he spoke about Mr Allen being a discounter JOSEPH RACKSTRAW policeman D 169 I apprehended the prisoner—I was waiting at the door of the chop=house in Woodstock-street and saw him come down stairs with Mr Allen—Mr Allen said he should give him into custody for uttering the note knowing it so forged—I took him to the station—he asked Mr Allen if he could say something to him—Mr Allen said no he had nothing to do with it—he said in the station that the endorsement of Jabez Moore was not on the note when he gave it to Mr Allen and he did not know but what any other person or Mr Allen might have put it on himself Cross-examined Q You were not examined before the Magistrate A I was—he was taken on this charge but Mr Moore did not attend and no deposition was taken JABEZ MOORE re-examined I never employed any one to endorse or accept a bill for me—I was able to write at that time—I do not think the prisoner mentioned the amount of the bill—I never had it in my hand—I am not acquainted with the prisoner s writing GUILTY of uttering Aged 43 — Transported for Seven Years There were two other indictments against the prisoner for larceny 
t18480403-1056  1056 THOMAS SCHUH alias David Bernhard feloniously forging and uttering an endorsement to a bill of exchange for 100l with intent to defraud Lionel Nathan Rothschild and others MESSRS BODKIN and WILDE conducted the Prosecution EDMUND LANE I am clerk to Messrs Rothschild On 31st Jan the Prisoner presented this bill to me— produced —I asked him if his name was Lorentz Weber—he said it was—I afterwards saw him write that name on the bill and I made a communication to Mr Kirchner FREDERICK GEORGE KIRCHNER I am clerk to Messrs Lionel Nathan Rothschild and others I saw the prisoner at our office on 31st Jan —he had spoken first to Mr Lane—I did not see him endorse the bill but I had instructed Mr Lane to get it endorsed—after Mr Lane had told me something I desired the prisoner to walk into a private room—I asked if his name was Lorentz Weber—he said Yes —I told him in the presence of Mr Rothschild that the bill could not be paid at present that it must be left to be inquired into on account of an irregularity and as there was no advice and he must leave his address and call again—he gave his address 118 Long Acre —seeing there was a hesitation in paying the bill he produced this letter No 10 and said Here is a letter I received from my father containing the bill and I have received another on a former occasion for the same amount —he gave me this letter to look at—Mr Rothschild sent for an officer and gave him in charge—I understand German and have made a translation of the letter THOMAS MERCER I am porter to Messrs Rothschild and was at their premises on 31st Jan The prisoner was detained there in the hall whilst as officer was sent for—while there I saw him put a letter into the fire—I took it out while it was in flames and the prisoner said I should burn my hand I put it out—this is it No 10 —I kept possession of it till I gave it to Bryant—I put a mark on it JOSEPH BRIANT City-policeman 82 I took the prisoner in custody at Messrs Rothschild s—he gave the name of Thomas Schuh MARY ANN LLOYD My father keeps the Sun coffee-house 118 Long Acre I have known the prisoner four or five months by the name of Weber—we have received letters for him at his request—they appeared to be foreign letters—I gave them all to him—the letter produced No 10 is one gave him on 31st Jan —it had then been in the house a week or ten days DANIEL FORRESTER I received the documents numbered 1 2 5 6 7 8 11 12 13 and 14 from Mr Hine ANTHONY HINE I am a German and live at 3 High-street Bloomsbury The prisoner lived there in Dec last and until he was apprehended—I know his writing and believe this letter No 11 which I received on 4th Feb after he was in custody to be his—I afterwards gave Forrester the officer the papers he has alluded to—I got them from the prisoner s room—these Nos 3 4 and 9 are the same character—I believe them to be the prisoner s writing—I knew him by the name of Bernhard—I did not know him at all before he came to lodge with me—in consequence of receiving that letter No 11 I sent for Peter Hoffnagel made a communication to him showed him the letter and he afterwards went to Forrester—the papers did not go out of my hands till they were called for—I have not often seen the prisoner write—I saw him write in his room once or twice—I believe the endorsement Lorentz Weber On the first bill to be the prisoner s writing PETER HOFFNAGEL I am the son of George Hoffnagel of Wartsburg in Bavaria In the summer of 1846 I was in London and had a lodging in Goodman s-fields—I have a half-brother the son of my mother by a forme marriage named Lorentz Weber—he came over that year and lived with me about four months—I know the prisoner by the name of David Bernhard he was living there at the same time—he and Weber were together a good deal sometimes for an hour or two—the prisoner is a German and comes from Baden—he and Weber spoke of our family sometimes—my brother expected 300l from my father in Germany—I and my brother have talked about that in the prisoner s presence—my brother went away and went into a situation—the prisoner left before my brother—in 1847 I was in the employment of a baker in Charlotte-street Islington—Weber came to me there twice and the prisoner with him—my brother said in Aug that he was going to America he was going that afternoon to Liverpool and came to wish me good-bye—I wished him good-bye—I have not heard of him since—the prisoner was with him—I have seen the prisoner three or four times since and asked him if he had not heard anything of my brother—he always replied No —I last asked him that at Christmas—I did not write to my father after my brother left in consequence of a little difference between us—the prisoner knew of that difference—I never let my father know that my brother bad gone to America—these letters are my father s writing looking at Nos 1 2 5 6 and 10 and this burnt letter also—I know Lorentz Weber s writing—I believe these two papers Nos 12 and 13 to be his writing Prisoner Q Did you shake hands with your brother A No—he wanted me to pay him some money I had lent him—I heard you advise him to go to America—you said he should go to America—I know tou said many times You had better go to America for it will be better for you —he authorized you to receive 30s he had lent Mr Reswick because he said he could not wait if he went to America—if you got it you were to send it to America MR KIRCHNER re-examined I have made translations of these letters— These being read Nos 1 2 5 and 6 were from G G Hoffnagel of Wartsburg Bavaria addressed to his son-in-law Lorentz Weber relating to various family and business matters and to the remittance of the 200l No 6 enclosed the 100l bill Nos 3 4 and 9 proved to be in the prisoner s writing purported to be answers from Lorentz Weber in which mention was made of his being engaged in the wine trade and of his intended marriage acknowledging the receipt of one 100l bill and pressing for the remittances of the other —the letter numbered 9 pressing for the remittance of the second bill was received with others by our house from our correspondent s bankers in Bavaria—the first bill had been paid before that letter was received it was arranged that the second bill should be sent—this is a translation of No 11 — read—Addressed Mr Hine 3 High-street Bloomsbury Giltspur-street prison Dear Sir —I find myself in a very melancholy situation namely innocently by incautiousness in a prison namely—on Monday I met an acquaintance who asked me to do him a favour to go to a certain house and fetch a letter for him he had some reasons he said for not fetching it himself in this letter there was a bank-note for 100l which belonged to another party he requested me to take the same to Messrs Rothschild s office and to draw the money for the same as I had done the same for him once before I did not hesitate to do it again he gave me the letter and said I had only to sign the name of the party to whose order the bill was drawn and if there was any hesitation to say I had received the amount of other bills the brother of this person is Peter Hoffnagel go to him he lives at 31 Charlotte-street Charlotte-terrace White Conduit-house and explain the thing to him and come here with him to-morrow morning early exactly at ten o clock an arrangement between him and me will place me at liberty do not forget to destroy all my papers which you can find in my room I am to appear to-morrow at eleven or twelve o clock do not fail everything depends upon it when you come here ask for Thomas Schuh and I shall be called and by all means come and bring with you Peter Hoffnagel DAVID BERNHARD —Translations of papers 12 and 13 proved to be in Lorentz Weber s writing were here read in which mention was made of his going to America—the bill was here read Prisoner s Defence I am unfortunately placed in this painful position through misplaced confidence in a person whom I cannot produce in Court to substantiate this statement In Aug 1847 Lorentz Weber with whom I had been long on terms of friendship left England for America but previously informed me and another friend named Thomas Schuh his wishes respecting some property in his father-in-law s hands of whom he spoke in a manner that led me to suppose that he considered him more as an enemy than a friend by keeping him from inheriting some property left him by his real father and proposed a plan by which he thought he could obtain what he was justly entitled to and letters were then written with his knowledge and consent to his father-in-law in Germany by Thomas Schuh before Weber left London and from his confidence in me Weber directed that I should receive his letters and sign any bill or document where his signature might be required and from our total ignorance of law was not aware that any written authority was required I accordingly having met afterwards with Schuh he informed me that he held a letter from Weber just received by him and which he read to me in which Weber described his voyage and other particulars also directing Schuh or myself to receive the 100l from the prosecutor and to take care of it some time afterwards Schuh called again on me with another letter from Weber as he said and also read it in which he was requested to forward the 100l to him also to take the second bill I accordingly paid the 100l over to Schuh who I always believed send it to Weber after we had received the second bill Schuh said as I signed the first bill I ought to sign the second I accordingly took it to the prosecutor and was given into custody and Schuh absconded and I have not heard that he can now be met with as Lorentz Weber I am informed is dead all hope from him is ceased I can only assert my innocence and that if the money is not forwarded to Weber that I was made a victim of by Schuh GUILTY Aged 22 — Transported for Ten years There was another indictment against the prisoner for forging the endorsement to the other 100l bill 
t18480403-1075  1075 JAMES DEWEY and WILLIAM BROWN feloniously engraving parts of a 5l promissory of the Reading bank with intent to defraud Henry Simonds and others MESSRS BODKIN and HUDDLESTON conducted the Prosecution CHARLES JOHN GOVE SPRAKE I am an engraver at 14 Meard s-court Wardour-street Soho—I formerly lived in Pultney-court Golden-square directly opposite a person of the name of Layton On 17th Feb Mr Layton brought the prisoner Brown to my apartment—Brown said he had come to see my work that Mr Layton had been recommending me and he wished to see some specimens of my engraving—I asked him what style he wanted as there were so many—he seemed to hesitate and at last produced this Galverston share note marked A and said he merely wanted some specimens of that sort to show his friend in the country that it was sent him to get the work done—he took three specimens of my work and came again I think on the next Tuesday with the specimen and produced this note of the Reading bank No 57581—I then had a signature—he wished to know what the estimate would be for engraving two plates necessary to produce a similar note—I had not doubt explained to him that two plates would be necessary one for the note and another for the word Five —I told him the expense and what the printing of the notes would be—I had two days before that communicated with Messrs Simonds the bankers—I saw Mr Mullens and acted under his direction—I made these memorandums produced of all that took place between me and Brown—I next saw him on 29th and received from him a verbal order for the plates with a 5l -note—he left the note with me—the signature was cut off as it is now—he was to have brought me 5s but he only brought 4s —he said his friend was in the neighbourhood and he would get the other shilling directly—he returned is less than half an hour with the shilling—he asked the price of half a quire of paper for printing the notes and whether I could get it for him—next day 1st March he called again I inquired how the numbers were to be affixed—an appointment was made for the following Saturday the 4th—he came about eleven o clock brought 10s and promised more in the course of the day—he appeared anxious about getting the paper for the notes—I told him I had not got it there was time enough for that—he called again between four and five and brought another 10s and an arrangement was made for the plate to be ready by four o clock on the Monday—he called and I put him off the next day—he came next day about seven in the evening—I showed him the plate—it was not quite done—I put him off till twelve or one o clock the next day—he came about half-past one and I gave him an impression of the plate I had shown him with the word Five and also a specimen of the paper—he took them away and promised to cell in half an hour or three-quarters with 30s —he said he was going to show them to his friend—when he came back he asked when I would get the two plates ready for making a finished note—he wished to have it on the Staturday—he called again that day and paid 1s 5s —he had promised me 30s —he promised me the other 5s at twelve or one next day—he called the next day and brought me the other 5s and I promised to have the writing of the other plates done by five the following Saturday and the ornament and ruling on the Monday by eleven or twelve—he spoke about the numbering—I advised that they should be put on separately—he said the paper was highly approved of it could not match better—he came again on Saturday 11th March—he gave me a half-sovereign—I spoke about the signatures and the blanks and he gave me a must see the parties and would let me know in a quarter of an hour whether I was to engrave the signatures—he did not say where he was going to but in the neighbourhood—he came back within half an hour and said the parties would decide about the numbering and the signatures on the Monday—he said they wanted the plates on the Monday and would make a fresh agreement for the signatures—he asked me the price of the signatures—I said 30s —I was to make fac similes of the signatures Fulbrook and Simmonds—he had told me that they were being lithographed—he did not show me the other signature then—I have not seen it since the first day—he was to bring me 1l on Monday 13th March—he came and I gave him this plate produced without the ornament—he said he had it to shaw to the party—he returned about four o clock and brought me 6s 6d with the plate—he said he could not see his friend—he called again between seven and eight in the evening of the 14th—he asked if I would let him have the pattern note the genuine note which I had—I had it was at the printer s to have the blue ink matched—I promised to give him some impressions about two o clock next day—he said he wanted them to make money of—he returned in about half an hour with 2s —on 15th I saw him about half-past two—I had arranged with him that everything should then be ready—my wife was gone to the printers—he waited till she came back and I showed him the six impressions she brought—he said the imitation was quite near enough nothing if fact could be better and he was perfectly satisfied and if I would give him them they the parties would turn them instantly into cash and should have my money in half an hour—I refused to let him have them as I did not know him even his name or where he lived—he said he lived in the City—I then gave him the six impressions and the original note—the next time I saw him at the Mansion-house in custody and I there saw these six impressions which I had given him—there are marks on the plates which I see on the engravings—I put them there purposely Dewey Q Did you ever see me at your house A Not that I am aware of—I cannot say how far my house is from Dean-street—Meard s-court opens into Dean-street—you can walk from on e to other in two minutes—my house cannot be seen from Dean-street—I believe the notes produced are the same I gave Brown but the plates have left my possession since and I cannot say COURT Q When did you part with the plates A On the day they were taken into custody—no more impressions had been struck off then—I gave the plates to some one in authority at the Mansion-house—they had been in my custody in the interval DANIEL FORRESTER I was called on to assist in the observation of what was going on at Mr Sprake s and noticed Brown s visits there—I saw him between one and two o clock on the 11th come up the court towards Dean-street in a direction from Mr Sprake s house—he motioned with his hand as he came up the court and I observed the prisoner Dewey standing in Dean-street opposite the court so as to be able to see the motion—Brown jointed him in Dean-street and they went down Dean-street into Compton-street and turned up Frith-street—when I came into Queen-street in Frith-street I only saw Dewey—I stayed there five or ten minutes—Dewey was waiting about from Queen-street to Dean-street—I then observed them both walking along Queen-street into Greek-street across Greek-street up Rose-street and there I missed them—I saw no more of them till the Monday when I saw them both in Wardour-street near Meard s-court—I saw Dewey afterwards standing by himself at the corner of Peter-street and Wardoor-street—Peter-street is nearly opposite Meard s-court at the Wardour-street end—some time afterwards I saw Brown go from Meard s-court up Wardour street into Broad-street and turn into Poland-street where I missed him—I did not see Dewey again that day—I only saw him for a short time—this plan produced is a correct representation of the streets and courts of which I have been speaking—the black mark indicates Sprake s house—on the 15th in consequence of something that was told me I went about half-past three o clock to a public-house in Poland-street about 150 or 200 yards from Sprakes s and met Brown coming out of the parlour-door which is only a step or two from the house door—when he saw me he immediately turned back into the parlour—I followed him and observed him immediately pass something to Dewey who was sitting in a chair by the fire—I made towards the fire-place—Brown caught hold of me—at the same time I saw Dewey throw something on the fire—I extricated myself immediately from Brown and got this parcel of five notes which have been produced from the fire—they were folded up very tight in paper and thrown on the fire in the paper—I marked them at the time—Dewey threw the parcel on the fire immediately it was passed to him—he did not open it—while I had the parcel in my hand I asked Brown whether he could give any explanstion respecting it—I had opened it sufficiently to know what it contained—he said he knew nothing about it—I then asked the same question of Dewey and he said he knew nothing about it—I searched them and found this card on Brown with the name S Fulbrook Aug 1847 scratched on it—I also found some papers of no consequence—I took them both into custody and searched them at the Mansion-house and found in Dewey s coat-pocket part of a cigar-case which contained this other impression and the genuine pattern 5l note No 57581 with one of the signatures cut off—I asked if he could give any explanation respecting them—he stated that a person in the public-house gave him the cigar-case as it was to hold—I asked him the person s name and he made no answer—I also found some certificates of shares in Dewey s pocket-book Dewey Q How far was I from Sprake s house when you first saw me A About forty or fifty yards—I think you might see the door of the house from there—there were several other persons in the room of the public-house—I did not see you at any other place that day before I took you—I cannot say whether you were smoking a pipe—I should think there was about half an hour between the times of my searching you—I do not recollect that you asked me at the public-house what the charge was against you MR BODKIN Q I suppose you had assistance near A Yes two men—I kept the prisoners under my sight between the times of my searching them—they were handcuffed so as not to be able to do anything SAMUEL GILL I keep the Star and Garter 62 Poland-street Dewey was at my house three times within a week or ten days of his being taken—Brown was with him once about two or three days before he was taken Dewey Q What time was it I went to your house on the 15th A Between eleven and twelve o clock in the morning—I did not see you go out at all—I do not know a customer named Evans CHARLES SIMONDS I am a banker at Reading—the firm consists of John Simonds Charles Simonds the elder and myself This is one of the notes issued by our bank—the signature is taken off—it was my signature—this is an imitation of part of it—I gave no authority to any one to engrave this plate—we have never altered our plate—I received a communication from Mr Sprake early in March and communicated with Messrs Bush and Muilens the solicitors to the Society for the Prevention of Frande on Bankers Dewey Q Would you have given cash for that good note in this state A No on one would be imposed on by the imitation in its present state—it has no date or signature Dewey s Defence I got the papers by exchanging five Southampton and Manchester railroad notes for them I sold Brown a gallon of spirits of wine for 12s he was to pay me on Saturday I went with him to Dean-street where he was to receive some money he gave me 7s next Monday I met him by appointment we went to Wardour-street he gave me the remaining 5s the next Wednesday I went to Mr Gill s and dined I was smoking my pipe and a man named Evans came in and asked me to take charge of his umbrella and cigar-case while he went to the closet soon after Brown attempted to go out Forrester came in and seized him and said I took something from Brown but I did not I may have thrown my pipe on the fire but cannot say I asked Forrester what charge he had against me he made no answer if he had told me I had an opportunity of finding the man who gave me the cigar-case his men were drinking at the station and I could have destroyed it having one hand at liberty if I had known there was anything in it DEWEY— GUILTY Aged 57 BROWN— GUILTY Aged 33 Transported for Ten Years Before Mr Justice Erle 
t18480403-1120  1120 JAMES MAYHEW forging and uttering a bill of exchange for 40l with intent to defraud Cuthbert Collingwood Hall—Other COUNTS with intent to defraud Harriet Ann Fisher MESSRS CLARKSON BALLANTINE and HUDDLESTONE conducted the Prosecution CUTHBERT COLLINGWOOD HALL I live at Farnham Royal near Slough Bucks I know the prisoner—I first employed him to negociate bills for me I think in 1843—after having employed him for some time my affairs were put in the bands of Messrs Gray and Berry my father s solicitors—that is rather better than two years ago—I have employed the prisoner on one occasion since that—I never gave him authority to sign my name to paper— three bills were here produced by Mr Martin —this 40l bill dated Oct 26 1847 purports to be drawn by me—the signature is not mine—I was not employing the prisoner at that time—I did not give him any authority to sign my name to it—I have not derived any benefit whatever from it—I did not endorse this bill for 27l 14s 6d dated 1st Oct 1847—I was not employing the prisoner then—I did not authorise him or any one else to endorse it—I know nothing whatever about it—the acceptance to this bill for 38l 15s dated Oct 13 is not mine—I gave the prisoner no authority to accept that bill—I believed I had not been in communication with him on the subject of bills about that time—from having been sued on one or more of these bills I obtained the means of examining them—On 16th Feb last I was at the Rainbow tavern that was on the day I inspected the bills after consulting my solicitors on the subject—I think I examined the 40l bill on that day—I had seen it before—Mr Butler the holder had come down to my house with them and showed them to me on 7th Jan I think—that was first knowledge I had that these bills were out against me—the prisoner came into the Rainbow after I was there—I called him over and said I had a very serious charge against him for forgery—Mr Gray was with me—the prisoner said I confess to it all —Mr Gray said to him that he did not wish to take an undue advantage of him as he had no professional adviser—the prisoner knew Mr Gray—he said he confessed to it all that the two bills for 40l and the 27l 14s 6d were forgeries that the bill for 118l was my genuine acceptance but he had altered the date of the year from 1845 to 1847—the 118l bill was not produced at that time Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q How long have you resided at Farnham A Since 1842—I knew the prisoner in 1842 and had business transactions with him in 1843—when I first knew him he was in the employment of Mr Flint the auctioneer—he left that employment about a year and a half ago—he did not leave Mr Flint to become my agent in London—he has acted in that way in issuing bills for me I mean getting my bills discounted—I was not living on bills at that time I had an income of about 700l a year—I cannot tell how many a week I used to get discounted—I had no business—I had about eight acres of hand then—I was a wine-merchant fifteen years ago and a general merchant as well—I did not tell—I retired from the business—my father paid some things for me on that occasion—I believe he paid my debts at least he paid 1200l or 1400l —I cannot tell whether I should have failed if he had not paid my debts—I am forty years of age next June—the settlement which my father made was in 1846 and 1847 that was done through my solicitors Messrs Gray who are also my father s solicitors—that settlement related to the bills that the prisoner had got discounted for me at various times—there are memorandums of the bills produced in Court—I did not keep what is termed a bill-book I kept a memorandum book—I cannot tell how many bills the prisoner got discounted for me from 1843 to 1846—there were not as many as a thousand or fifteen hundred—I have no idea how many—sometimes I did not get a bill discounted once in a month—the amount my father paid for me in 1846 and 1847 was I suppose between 5000l and 6000l that does not include all the prisoner s transactions—there is only one of his unsettled now—there was an annuity paid off which was included in that—I have not accepted as many as twenty bills at a time and sent them up to the prisoner—there may have been as many as three or four but I think not more—perhaps that has not happened once in a month and it may have been once a week—I cannot tell whether the prisoner had means of his own for discounting bills—I know that he got the bills discounted elsewhere—I paid him for the discount whenever there was an account—he never kept a correct account and I cannot say that I did there was so much put down perhaps 10l or 12l —I presume he used to have that for his trouble—I dare say you have an account—there were no stated payments to him—I did not order wine through him—I did on one occasion it was an acceptance of a party who became bankrupt and he agreed to pay half in wine and half on an acceptance—I never got the acceptance and the wine was very bad—I do not know that I employed the prisoner to transact any other business for me in London—I never saw Mr Carruthers—the wine came from him—I know Mr Wells a wine-merchant—I believe I had two dozen of wine from him through the prisoner not twelve dozen—I do not think the prisoner ever hired a servant for me—I am not fond of the sports of the field—the prisoner purchased a fowling-piece out of the monies he had in hand—I did not order him to buy it for me—I never had it—I was never in the habit of using a gun for sports—I have not frequently sent blank acceptances to the prisoner—the month and year were always included and my signature and the amount—the actual day was not always put in—I was not generally in the habit of leaving it to the prisoner—there may have been one or two such instances never five or six at one time—I was not in the habit of sending the prisoner post-dated checks to cash for me that I am aware of—I do not think I ever did that—I will not aware it but to the beat of my recollection I did not—the check-book will show it is here—I do not know that the prisoner obtained money from Mr Wells on my account on checks—I have paid the prisoner checks to take up bills—I believe those checks were not dated—I will not positively swear it—I think I have not frequently drawn checks on my bankers and sent them up to the prisoner when I was not in funds at the bankers to meet them—my bankers book is in Court—I do not remember without that—I do not know that I have done so—my father did not have the bills that were given up—they were given into the hands of Messrs Gray and Berry they are here they are in my possession and I produce them producing a great number from a bag —I had a transaction with a building society—I remember a transaction with the Eagle Company for 1000l —that was not negociated by the prisoner—I do not think he had anything to do with it—he did not introduce me to the gentlemen—I communicated with the prisoner about it but it was done through another party—I did not place that 1000l in the prisoner s hands for the purpose of bills—a great deal of the 1000l was to meet bills which the prisoner had discounted for me—I do not remember a transaction with a building or loan society in Titchfield-street for 10 5l about July 1845—I swear I know nothing about it—this bill looking at one produced by Mr Parry for 105l dated 19th July 1845 purporting to be accepted by Mr witness is a forgery—I did not pay it not that I know of—it appears that the prisoner has paid it because it is in his possession—it was not presented to me—these are all my memorandums for bills producing them —I believe all the bills that were sent to the prisoner were made payable at his house in London with the exception of one—I do not know that Mr Wells was a director or manager of this society in Titchfield-street—I never had any transaction with that society—this is the first time I have heard of it—I do not know Mr Hoffman—I do not know whether Mr Wells is here to-day— looking at a bill for 49l 10s dated May 2 1844 also purporting to be accepted by the witness —this is also a forgery—you have possession of it and therefore the prisoner has paid it—I know nothing about it—I have not paid it and never gave directions for paying it that I am aware of certainly not if I had been aware it was a forgery looking at another bill for 70l dated May 13 1844 similarly accepted —this is also a forgery—I never saw it before—the acceptance is not my writing and not authorised by me—the prisoner is the drawer—I know his writing—I do not know whose writing the acceptance is—I cannot form any opinion of it it is a trace a feigned hand—it is an imitation of mine—this letter looking at one dated Sept 2 1845 is my writing—it is addressed to the prisoner— this was a letter containing a list of acceptance falling due among which one for 105l was mentioned —that is not the bill there referred to—I cannot tell the date of the bill referred to in that letter—this other letter addressed to the prisoner is my writing— this was dated 2nd June 1844 enclosing a check for 49l 10s to meet an acceptance —that check was not for the payment of the 49l 10s bill you have produced—you will find a 49l 10s bill there but the originals have been paid—you an bringing forward the forgeries now looking at a three months bill for 35l 8s dated 5th Sept 1845 drawn and endorsed by the witness and accepted by John Whatmore selected from the settled bills produced by the witness —I have not paid this bill—I have only seen it in the hands of my solicitors—the acceptance to this bill for 56l 5s dated 9th Feb 1846 produced is not mine—I did not authorise the prisoner to write that acceptance—I have never seen that bill except in the hands of my solicitors—both these bills have been paid COURT Q Can you account for their being paid A Living in the country my solicitor paid all that he supposed bore my name there being the most implicit reliance placed on the prisoner—we never dreamt of a forgery and I never knew anything about these bills until these last forgeries we are prosecuting for came out and then in looking over the vouchers with my solicitor I found that he had paid two or three forged bills MR PARRY Q Did you before your solicitor paid these bills furnish him with an account A I furnished an imperfect account for I could not give him a perfect one—if I have a 120l bill drawn by the prisoner and endorsed by Heseltine and Edwards I will produce it—we have produced every document we have got—I have not kept back any bills—this letter dated 2nd May 1846 is my writing in which mention is made of a 120l bill—I do not know where that bill is—you have all that I had in my possession or my solicitor s— This was a letter to the prisoner commencing I enclose you there acceptance and a list for May twelve in number one of which was for 120l By a list for May I meant a list of bills due in May—I do not know what has become of that 120l bill—it may be in the prisoner s possession for he did not return me the bills regularly I have produced all his papers that I have—from 1843 to 1846 while these bill transactions were going on—I was very anxious to keep the matter from my father—he has expressed displeasure at my conduct and I was afraid of his anger—he now known that I have since been attempting to discount bills with the prisoner—I was once a candidate for the auditorship of a union—I was not successful—I had arranged with the prisoner that if I succeeded he was to transact all the accounts for me— looking at a number of letters —these are my writing except one—I did not enclose that to the prisoner—I never saw it before— These letters twenty-eight in number at dates from Jan 1844 to March 1846 were here read they disclosed on the part of Mr Hall a great variety of bill transactions with different parties requesting the prisoner to transmit him bills for acceptance pressing him to settle with the holders of some over due and to remit him money of the want of which he frequently complains —The prisoner was to satisfy the demands made upon him by getting the bills discounted—I used sometimes perhaps to send him a check for 100l —he had always a balance in hand—he has the accounts—I did not keep accounts in two or three instances—I sent them to him and was to have had them back but never could get them and that threw me all behind—these letters are mine— These were dated 1st June 1847 20th June 3rd and 17th Sept 16th Nov and 20th Oct in the first the witness requests the prisoner to get money from their old friends the usurers &c and in the last presses him to render the account so long promised —This letter is my writing dated July 9 1845 returning three bills of 118l 115l and 120l accepted and requesting an account of the same —my father has expressed to me the strongest disapprobation of my again discounting bills after the settlement of 1846—I bank at the Union Bank—I do not know that it is their custom to balance their customers accounts daily—mine was balanced twice a year—the prisoner has mentioned to me that he obtained the use of other persons names to my bills—I have seen those names on the bills when they have been returned—several of them were perfect strangers to me—I believe he told me that my bills were so stale in the market that it was necessary to freshen them up a bit with new names and I believe that was the fact—I occasionally came to town to see the prisoner—I was not in the habit of meeting him in out-of-the-way places for fear of my creditors—I think only in one instance—I generally met him at Mr Flint s where he was employed—he left there somewhere about Aug 1846 Q Has not the prisoner frequently represented to you the pressure he was under to meet your bills and have not you authorised him to use your name under circumstances of great pressure A No I have not—that I swear—it was between three and four when I met him at the Rainbow—it was not then proposed that the he should go to my father s to explain what matters were still out—I swear that—Mr Gray was present during the whole of the interview until I had the prisoner removed into a private room out of the coffee-room—I was with him in that room about half an hour—I did not then state to him that my father was very angy with me that he had found out I was again in the bill market nor did I suggest to him to go to my father to explain all the matters—that I swear—no one else was present COURT Q Do you mean that after he had admitted himself guilty of forgery you withdrew with him to a private room for half an hour A I do MR BALLANTINE Q Look at that bill is that your writing A It is this was a bill for 49l 10s dated May 2nd 1844 this is the bill referred to in my letter of 2nd June 1844—I met the prisoner accidentally at the Rainbow—I had not contemplated seeing him and taking him into custody at that time—my attorney was with me I had been with him to inspect the bills at Mr Abrahams office—it was in consequence of the prisoner saying I suppose you will take me into custody but I hope will not do so here that I ordered the private room—whilst I was with him in the private room my attorney went over to the Temple to take counsel s opinion—that was the reason the half-hour elapsed—I have not told anything that occurred after that only what occurred in presence of my solicitor before we went into the private room COURT Q Then had you no conversation in that half-hour A What took place in the private room was this he turned his pockets out and said there was no occasion to bring other people into the mess or words to that effect and he then gave me two bills and some notes signed by Fisher—I have the documents producing them and some street papers that he tore up and threw underneath the fire-place MR BALLANTINE Q Look at that bill for 118l is that the bill referred to in your letter of 9th July 1845 A It us—the month and year was to that bill when I sent it to the prisoner—it is now dated 1847 there has been an erasure and the 5 has been altered to a 7—I did not authorize that—this note is in the prisoner s writing— this was dated 29th Sept 1845 enclosing three bills to the witness one for endorsement and two for acceptance —when the prisoner said he had got other persons signatures he did not say that he had signed their names—I have only got into one discount matter since the settlement but it has turned out to be two—on 7th June I sent the prisoner a 100l acceptance to receive the money but I afterwards found there were two bills out against me—they are both my own genuine acceptance—he wrote to me that the bill was on a wrong stamp—I have only one here—it was only one transaction with him—I believe Mr Gray had full authority to settle the whole of the bills out against me—I never authorized the prisoner either verbally or by letter to write my name on the contrary he has been in the habit of sending me down bill to accept and return to him BENJAMIN GRAY I am a member of the firm of Gray and Berry solicitors I was employed by Mr Hall and his son to settle some bills due by the son—I paid several bills for him—a very few were paid personally by me they were paid by our firm—on 16th Feb I went to Mr Abrahams office to inspect the bills and afterwards went to the Rainbow tavern to lunch—the prisoner came in Mr Hall beckoned him to come across to the box were we were and said Mayhew I have a serious charge against you —Mayhew said he would confess all—Mr Hall said Do you know I have had two actions brought against me or I have been sued in two actions one by Fisher and another by Smith —the prisoner then said I confess your names were forges to Fisher s bills but your signature to Mr Smith s bill is a genuine signature but I altered the date from 1845 to 1847 —Mr Hall then produced a paper which I had given him being an account extracted from the declarations in the action commenced against him by Miss Fisher on two bills of exchange and Mr Hall said Tringham s and Lacom s acceptances —the prisoner said I forged them —Mr Hall asked if there were any other forgeries—Mayhew said there were not—Hall then said But Gingell holds some bills of mine which are forgeries —he said he had seen Gingell and Mr Hall would not be troubled on bills that Gingell had—Mr Hall asked if be would give an account in writing of the bills he had forged and took out his pocket-book—the priosner seened disposed to give an account and I said Mr Mayhew you know I am Mr Hall s solicitor and I do not wish to take an undue advantage of anything you may do that was as the pencil and paper were produced—Mayhew said he had done Mr Hall a great injury and he supposed a policeman would be sent for or that he would be given in charge and requested that his wife might be informed—they went into a private room and I went to consult the Counsel for the prosecutor—on my return he was given into custody by Mr Hall Cross-examined Q Did you go to old Mr Hall A No nor did I propose to go to the best of my recollection—I think I have a tolerably accurate recollection of what passed—I did not say You know Mr Mayhew we would not hurt a hair of your head —I was not examined before the Magistrate—I attended all four of the examinations—I dine at the Rainbow frequently and have taken lunch there—Mr Hall never furnished me with an account of the bills that were to be paid—he furnished some account it was an imperfect statement—he said he did not know what his liabilities were—he gave me the names of parties who held bills of his—I paid all bills that were brought to me which I believed were his acceptance or which had his name to them except one or two which are yet unpaid—I have not seen a bill for 140l in the hands of Mr Keen which is yet unpaid—I know Mr Hall stated to me that he had two acceptance coming due in this year—Mr Hall is being sued on some of these bills now in question—we are his sttorneys—we are defending three actions for him two of them on bills now in question and one for rent under a lease of an estate not of Farnham that is Mr Hall s private property but it is mortgaged—I have no recollection of defending any other actions for him but I do not attend to the common law—I never practised at criminal law mine is the conveyancing department principally—I employ Mr Sleap here as my agent—I have had a good many claims sent in against Mr Hall since Feb 1846 but I cannot give you the dates—his father has paid from 4 to 5000l —I paid a bill for 56l 5s dated 9th Feb 1846—I was not aware it was a forgery—I had not shown it to Mr Hall or had any communication with him about it—I had no idea when I paid the bills that any of them were forgeries or I should not have done so—I had barely any communication with him throughout the whole transaction COURT Q Was that discovered since A Yes in Feb last I believe—to the best of my recollection I paid this bill in Aug or Sept last JOHN WILLIAM BUTLER I am an ironmonger in the Edgeware-road and am acquainted with Mr Hall This bill for 27l 14s 6d and also this for 40l I received from the prisoner within three days of the time they are dated—the dates were Oct 1st and Oct 26th 1847 —the endorsement Cuthbert Collingwood Hall was on them both when they were first brought—I held two other bills one I hold now but the other for 100l I passed to Miss Fisher of 66 Cambridge-terrace Cross-examined Q Were you at the Police-court A Yes—I saw Mr Gingell there—he produced billa before the Magistrate and the prosecutor and I heard he was not required to attend any more—his bills turned out to be genuine and they were handed back to him—I gave the bill of 38l to Mr Abrahams and I think he produced it at the Police-court—I saw it put into Mr Hall s hand—I had seen Mr Hall before then I think it was on 24th Oct 1847 I then showed him these three bills and another one—he inspected them COURT A Are you the plaintiff in any of the actions A No—Mr Abrahams is Miss Fisher s attorney I am her agent—she makes a little money in the discount way Mr BALLANTINE Q And she is the Plaintiff on these bills A Yes—I went to Mr Hall at Slough on 24th Oct that was a day or two before the 40l bill became due—I knew the one for 27l would not be due till Jan but I saw him about that one—I saw him on the four—I think itt was about 27th or 29th Dec —I was wrong when I said 24th Oct —I think it was before the bills became due—I swear it was not 7th Jan because it was about the time the bill was coming due—it was on or about 27th Dec —I think I showed him this bill of 26th Oct before it came due—I went down because I was told they were not Mr Hall s acceptances and I took them in my pocket to ask him the question—he said the bill for 40l was not his acceptance—the bill for 38l he thought was his acceptance but afterwards he said it was not—the bill for 100l he said was his acceptance—that his been since paid—he said the bill for 27l 14s 6d was not his acceptance—I should not like to swear that I went down to Mr Hall before the bills were due but I think it was—I heard they were supposed to be forged the evening before I went down—Captain Tringham called on me and told me something—I had the bill in my possession at the time it became due Miss Fisher had given it me—I had it more than two days—I always present them when they are due—I think they were not due when I went to Slough—I think they had not then been presented COURT Q Surely you must know whether you had found any obstruetion to its being paid A I had not that was one reason for thinking it was not forged—they were presented as a matter of course—I am not confident of the day I presented them I think it was before they became due—I certainly presented them after having been down to Mr Hall that I swear—I had but the 40l bill at that time to present—I presented that to Mr Hall at Mayhew s house—I did not see Mr Hall COURT to MR HALL Q How were the bills renewed A With fresh ones—the prisoner sent them down to me two or three at a time for my acceptance—my letters show no acknowledgment that I had received them from him—I never gave him any authority to sign a bill—he has never found funds for the purpose of bills—he always had a very large balance in hand but I never could get an account from him William Kensitt collector of Poor s-rates for the

conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM HUMPHREYS MORTON I am a clerk in the Three per Cent Reduced Transfer-office in the Bank of England I produce an extract from the ledger which I have compared with the original it is correct— this was a transfer of 1070l 3s 11d Reduced Three per Cent Annuities by John Wilkinson and William Shepherd to James Neatby Warner on 6th April 1843 —I produce the transfer-book—here is the transfer of the same amount of stock on that day—I attested the execution of it but have no recollection of the transaction or the parties—I saw them sign the book CHARLES THOMAS JENKINSON I am a solicitor of 29 Lombard-street In 1843 my offices were in Cannon-street—I was first acquainted with the prisoner in Feb 1838—he then lived in Mint-street Borough—I was concerned for Mr Brown his landlord s collector that introduced me to him—he was behind with his rent—he said his son had recently married a lady entitled to some money and he wished me to interfere to induce the executrix of Mrs Faddy to advance a sum of money for his son and referred me to a Mr Rivington who I saw several times but could not succeed until the prisoner s son and his wife became of age—the wife was entitled to the money under the will but the minority of the son was the great obstacle—about Dec 1838 the prisoner paid my bill for the trouble I had had—I hadno further instructions and do not know whether the rent was paid or not—I saw no more of the prisoner till Jan 1843 when he called on me and said he and his co-trustee under his son s settlement were about making some disposition of the fund and would I introduce him to my stock-broker—I referred him to Mr Edwin Newton Bryant and did not see him again till he was in Newgate Prisoner I never called at your office in my life I met you in the street Witness You called at my office EDWARD NEWTON BRYANT I am a stock-broker of 16 Throgmorton-street On 16th June 1813 Mr Jenkinson called on me and introduced the prisoner who said he wished me to sell some stock and he would bring his co-trustee William Shepherd next day—next day I saw the prisoner and the other man at the Bank—I had caused a transfer to be prepared in the Bank-books—it was made to James Neatby Warner—I saw the prisoner sign it—the other party signed William Shepherd —I attested their signatures and identify them—this is my signature—I gave them this check produced for 1 016l 13s 6d I do not know to which of them—here is William Shepherd on the back of it—that was not written at my request —I never saw the prisoner again till a few days ago at Newgate OWEN THOMAS WILLIUIS In June 1843 I was a clerk in Messrs Glvnn s banking-house—Mr Brvant kept an account there—this is the book in which I enter checks which I cash and the mode in which I cash them—in June 1843 I cashed this check produced with a 300l -note No 899929 dated 11th March 1842 two 200l -notes 500l in other notes and 16l 13s 6d in money—I have no recollection of the party—one of the 50l notes was No 08024 dated 8th Dec 1842 WILLIAM WYBURD I am one of the inspectors of notes in the Bank of England In 1843 I was a clerk in the money-teller s department and kept a cash-book in which I entered my transactions produced —this 300l -note was presented to me on 30th June 1843 to be cashed—the person told me his name was Wilkinson which he put on the note as we always require—here is J Wilkinson 26 Crispin-street - - YATES police-inspector M I have known the prisoner since 1830 when the M division was formed—he was an inspector of that division and continued so till 1835 when he went to the E division—he left in 1835 or 1836 quitted the police and kept a fish-shop in Mint-street—I have seen him write and believe the writing on this note to be his a £50 note No 08024 T V dated 8th Dec 1842 with William Gilpin 26 Crispin-street Spitalfields marked on it —this John Wilkinson in the Bank transfer-book is the prisoner s writing and also this signature indorsed on a deposit-receipt of the Gloucestershire Bank JOHN CRADDOCK I am agent for the Northleach Branch of the Gloucestershire Bank—I gave the prisoner this deposit-receipt for 500l —I think he paid in a 300l -note and a 200l -note— read— Cirencester Feb 27th 1843 Recived of John Wilkinson £500 to be accounted for For the Gloucestershire Banking Company Henry Harriss —I procured this receipt from Cirencciter Prisoner Q Whose money did I represent it to be A Your son s—I understood you had placed him in business at Cheltenham JOSEPH HALL I am clerk to Edwin Savage Bailey a solicitor of Berners-street Oxford-street he has transacted the business of Mr Carpenter Smith who became a lunatic three years ago I produce an indenture of settlement dated 14th Dec 1838 between the prisoner s son and Susannah Ann Dixon—it is a post nuptial settlement—the trustees are John Wilkinson and Samuel Shepherd CHARLES RIVINGTON I am a solicitor of Fenchurch-buildings In 1838 I was concerned for Alexander Holfield sole executor of Mrs Judith Taddy—in that year I had several applications to advance money said to be due to the prisoner s son s wife the prisoner came four or five times—I refused to advise my client to make any transfer of money until the execution of a settlement by the husband of the moneys left to his wife on that wife and her children—she was a legatee of 2 000l —I required a post nuptial settlement to be executed by the parties—delay arose by their not being of age—this is the settlement produced —it was signed in my presence by the husband and wife and prisoner in my office and attested by Mr Carpenter Smith—this is his signature—500l was advanced to the parties which was not the subject of a deed—in the first instance the prisoner applied for 100l during his son s minority which was refused and he came in Nov on account of the daughter being ill in her confinement and I gave him 20l and on 14th Dec having invested 1 500l in the Reduced Three per Cents in the names of John Wilkinson and William Shepherd a settlement was executed and the balance about 511l paid over to the prisoner 376l of it by check—l was deducted for law charges—here is a power in this settlement to lend or make a further advance of 500l to the prisoner—it is dated 14th Dec 1838 and recites that the prisoner s son s wife being entitled to 2 000l under the will of Mrs Taddy and that Thomas Wilkinson and his wife having applied for payment the executors had required that the legacy should be settled for the benefit of the husband and wife and their children and recites the purchase of 1 610l 14s 9d Reduced Three per Cents with power to the trustees to lend the prisoner 500l on his bond Prisoner I never signed any deed the witness handed the deed to the prisoner I believe this is my writing but I forgot it my son was not of age then he did not become of age till the next 5th Dec Witness I have a certificate of his being of age WILLIAM SHEPHERD I am a publican of Dudley Worcestershire From 1825 to 1839 I kept the Grapes Black man-street Borough—the prisoner was then night-constable of St Olave s Borough and afterwards inspector of the M division of police and then he kept a fish-shop next door to me—he came there about 1835—we were on intimate terms—in 1837 his son Thomas married and came with his wife to live with him in Mint-street—when his son became of age he and his son asked me to be a trustee—I consented and attended Mr Carpenter Smith s office to execute the settlement—I understood that the son received 500l when the deed was signed—we signed a power of attorney authorising Thomas Wilkinson to receive the dividends—in 1839 I was applied to to sell out another sum of 500l —I agreed and afterwards did so THOMAS ELY I am attesting-witness to this transfer of 540l 10s 10d of John Wilkinson and William Shepherd on 7th June 1839 WILLIAM SHEPHERD re-examined This is my signature to this transfer—the prisoner signed it also—I never transferred or consented to the transfer of any more directly or indirectly—I think the prisoner left the Borough in the same year—I understood he went to Birmingham—I afterwards left and went to Dudley—I saw nothing more of the prisoner until I went to Birmingham in 1842—he was then keeping a butcher s shop in Dale-end there—his son also kept a butcher s shop there at another pat of the town—the prisoner told me that he was going to give up the shop and going to London for he could not get a living there—I believe the shop was closed at the time—I think there was no meat in the shop—I never saw him again till I saw him in gaol at Bristol in April I think—when at Birmingham he took me to see his two grand-children—I saw those childern last Monday at Cheltenham—about four or five years ago I was applied to by Mr Carpenter Smith to transfer a further portion of the fund—I refused to do so—last Christmas I received an anonymous letter—that was the first intimation I had that there was anything wrong with respect to this fund—In consequence of that and from inquiries I made I went to the Bank of England and requested to be made acquainted with the state of the fund—among other things I saw this book—I see the name of William Shepherd subscribed here as one of the parties to the transfer of 1070l 3s 11d —it is not my signature—I know nothing about it—I never authorised the prisoner or any one else to subscribe that—I never had any communication with the prisoner on the subject—I had no communication with him till Christina 1847—I did not know where he was Prisoner Q I believe when you were applied to to sell out 500l to let my son have you said you would not consent to it without I could get him away from London as he was going on at a random rate and disgracing himself A Yes I advised his leaving London and said if he would I would consent to advance the 500l —I blamed you as much as him for leaving him in possession of the money—I was not aware when that settlement was made that your son was not of age CHARLES RIVINGTON re-examined The prisoner produced a document to me about his son s age—before he produced it he told me his son would be of age in Dec 1838—I would not act upon his statement and then either the prisoner or Mr Carpenter Smith produced the document—the prisoner told me his son was of age before he executed the deed and it was on the faith of that that he got my check Prisoner s Defence It is exactly the truth that has been stated it is of no use in me to make a wronng defence there was no intention of fraud one of the executors under the will said that he would throw the estate into Chancery and he would have nothing to do with it as they were married without consulting him of course we did not like that as my son had no means of supporting his wife and I had no means of supporting them I told him to agree to any proposal rather than do that accordingly everything which was proposed was agreed to but the deed required execution before my son was of age if be has been extravagant and spent the money foolishly I can t answer for that this was done six years ago and no person has ever been called upon to repay the money and never will be nothing was done on my part with the intention of depriving any person of their just rights had my son applied for the money I should then have said he had acted in a most rascally manner and it would be an attempt to rob but Mr Shepherd will never be involved in any difficulty nor the Bank of England nor any one— MR CLARKSON stated that an application had been made to MR SHEPHERD for re-paymert —that was entirely without my knowledge I have not seen Mr Carpenter Smith these six years GUILTY Aged 63 — Transported for life

there—my brother Donald was in the shop by my side—the prisoner asked to look at some silver pencil-cases—he selected one at 9s 6d —he then asked to look at some wedding-rings—I showed him some and he selected one at 10s —he took out what appeared to be a 5l note from his pocket handed it to me and asked me to change it—I did not give it him—I suspected it and gave it to my brother—he looked at it and said to the prisoner Will you walk with me as far as Mr Packer s in the Quadrant —the prisoner consented and they went together to Mr Packer s—I followed them—Mr Packer said in the prisoner s presence that he was the same man that had passed a bad 5l note to him on the previous Saturday—my brother then had the note—he gave it to me back—ray brother Packer and the prisoner then went to the Vine-street Police-station which is just opposite—I there took the date and the number of the note and put my initials in pencil on the back—this is the note produced —I gave it the policeman Thomas Mould Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q You are not mistaken about the time A No—I looked at a clock at eight o clock because I do certain things with the books at eight o clock and I know it was not half-past eight because that is the time we shut up shop—there was a young man from Mr Packer s shop before the Magistrate—he is not here—I gave the note to my brother directly I received it from the prisoner DONALD ROWLAND On 22nd May I was in the shop with my brother—the prisoner came in dressed as he is now—I had before that received an account of a person from Mr Packer and had been put on my guard that morning—after the prisoner had agreed for the purchase of the things my brother handed to me this supposed 5l Bank of England note—I looked at it—I walked between him and the door and said You know where you got this note from I suppose and can account for it —he said Yes I can —I said You must come with me if you please to Mr Packer s in the Quadrant —he said he would go and walked towards the door—I said I must take your arm if you please —we then walked down the street together—I said Do not consider yourself in custody because we are only going to have it explained —I was fearful of going too far and having an action brought against me—he said he would not consider himself in custody but if that was the case he thought that he could go without being held—I did not let go of him—I went with him to Mr Packer s who said he was the same man that had passed a forged five on him on the Saturday—the prisoner did not say anything to that—I never lost sight of the note—I had it in my left hand in my pocket till I gave it to my brother Cross-examined Q What time was it A About eight o clock—the conversation I have stated was in the shop and as we walked along—just as we were going out of Mr Packer s door the prisoner said I do not under-stand all this or I do not know what it is about or something of that sort THOMAS MOULD policeman A 123 On Monday evening 22nd May I was at Vine-street station—the Drisoner was brought there about half-past eight o clock by the two Mr Rowlands and Mr Packer and given into of custody—I searched him and found on him 8s 10 1/2 d

there were some metal ones in the window and some bronze ones—he then turned round and said Have you got any table cutlery —I produced some balance-handled ones to him 3l a set—he said I do not like those have you got any others —I then showed him half a dozen at 12s which he said he would take—he asked if I could give him change for a 5l note—I said Yes —he gave me his name and address as Hall Yere-street Oxford-street—I repeated it to him and then wrote it on the note in his presence—I gave him 4l 8s in change—this is the note produced —it purports to be a Plymouth note—it was sent to the Bank and returned as forged Cross-examined Q Is this your writing 6 Vere-street Oxford-street 5 22 48 A Yes this W S is Mr Slark s writing—I gave it to him next morning to pay into the Bank—I asked the prisoner for his address—I had never seen him before—I am confident he is the same person by his dress—a good many gentlemen dress like that—I cannot tell how long he was in the shop—I should have known him if I had met him in the street—I know him by his dress and manner—I knew a person now dead very much like him but he squinted—he came in like a man of business—Ipointed him out at the Police-court from amongst several others—I do not know whether any were dressed in the same way—I only know him by his dress COURT Q When did you see him at the Police-court A Last Friday week I think SIR J BAYLEY Q Did you take particular notice of him in consequence of his likeness to your deceased friend A Yes I did I have not the least shadow of a doubt that he is the man CHARLES PACKER I am a jeweller at 78 Quadrant On Saturday evening 20th May between six and seven o clock the prisoner came to my shop and said he wanted to look at some pencil-cases in the window marked 5s 6d —he took one and asked to look at some wedding-rings—he selected one at 10s —he tendered a 5l note in payment and while I was giving him the change he said I have put my name and address on the back —I had not asked for it—this is the note produced —there is on the back of it Hall Yere-street Oxford-street —I gave him the change—not liking the appearance of the note I went down to the Bank of England the first thing on Monday morning and they stamped it forged —I returned and informed my neighbours and among others Messrs Rowlands Cross-examined Q How long was he in the shop A Twenty minutes perhaps—he did not decide on the pencil-case and ring directly—I have been very much punished by gentlemen taking things—I never saw him before—my young man was in the shop—he went before the Magistrate—he is not here —I can swear to the pisoner by his general appearance and face—he had whiskers then which he has not now—he had them when I saw him the second time THOMAS MOULD re-examined I have made inquiries at 6 Vere-street anderery house in the street and could not find any person of the name of Hall THOMAS IVY I live at Froome in Somersetshire I know the prisoner—his real name is

England These two notes dated Plymouth 16th Nov are forged in everyparticular—there is no water-mark of the Bank of England on them—theyare both from the same plate—this one dated Manchester 16th Feb 1846 is forged also Cross-examined Q Are they good imitations A No—I never heard of the Bank paying a forged note and refusing a genuine one—I do not know whether it has occurred or not—I have been there thirty-five years—the engraving is not like that of a genuine note—it is very badly executed altogether— looking at a note produced by Mr Payne —this is a genuine note—to mypractised eye I have no difficulty in discerning the difference—I see a good many thousands in a day—they might deceive other persons I cannot say GUILTY Aged 29 — Transported for Twenty Years

any resemblance to your writing in it I A It bears a resemblance—no person could have done it but a person conversant with my handwriting or from a copy—it does not appear to have been lined—I can positively say it is not my writing JOSEPH THORNETT I live at No 21 York-street Westminster—I have been a gentleman s servant—I am not in employ at present In April last I put an advertisement into the Times newspaper—I have an aunt living at No 67 Seymour-place Bryanston street—I received a communication from her and went to York-street—on Good Friday evening the 21st of April a person called on me at York-street I cannot say who it was—it was neither of the prisoners—I afterwards received a check from that person in Mincing-lane—I took it to Messrs Lubbock s—as I was going from the place where the person gave me the check to Messrs Lubbock s I inquired of a gentleman the nearest way to the bankers —he said he could not tell—the prisoner Clark came up after me and asked me where I wanted to go—I told him I wanted to go to the Mansion-house—he said he was going that way and he would show me the way—we went along and he was talking about different things—we came together to Gracechurch-street I think it is—he said he was going no further he was going up to the right hand if I went straight along Lombard-street I should see the Mansion-house on the left hand and the Bank on the right—I had not said anything about the Bank before that—I went on there and came back again from the bank after I got the check cashed—I met Clark again in the middle of Lombard-street—it was then five or ten minutes after throe o clock—he asked me if I had done my business right—I said Yes —he said and so had he—we walked together past Gracechurch-street towards Mincing-lane—he said to me

person who had first seen me in York-street—it was in a passage in Mincing-lane I do not know the name of it—I afterwards showed the place to Mr Mullen s clerk—about the time I received the check I had seen Clark come out of the archway—he was not present when I received it but he followed me out—that was before he spoke to me—I took the proceeds of the check that I got from the cashier at the

waistcoat—I received it on 25th April at two o clock in the afternoon JOSEPH THORNETT re-examined A gentleman came to me at York-street on 21st April—I was looking out for a situation—I told him I was the person who had advertised for the situation—he said he had not time to stop and talk then but he would call to-morrow at eleven o clock—he said he wanted me for his brother who lived at Box-lodge Croydon—he called next morning at eleven—he said he had not time to stop and talk with me I might go with him and we would talk as we went along—we went to Great George-street Westminster—as we-were going he asked the wages I wanted—I told him 24l —he said his brother gave 26/ —he said he should have no objection to give me that and he thought I should have no objection to take it—I said No not in the least —he said his brother was a merchant—he said he was going into the City but he was going into an office on the left-hand side for a short time and he said I might go and come back—I went away and came back in half an hour or three-quarters—I then found him on the step of the door—we went on to Downing-street and when we got half-way down Downing-street he told me had to meet a gentleman somewhere and I was to go on to the East India Chambers in Leadenhall-street and meet him there—I went there and waited about a quarter of an hour—he came there—I thought he came across the road—he said Stop a moment I will go in and see if my brother is come to town —he went up the passage through the folding-doors into the East India Chambers—he was not gone hardly a minute—he came back and said his brother had not come to town and that he was sure to be in town that day—he said Come along with me a little way —we went to the corner of Billiter-street and he gave me sixpence and told me to set something to eat—he said his brother had not come and he wished I could meet him again at three at the East India Chambers—he left me and went back in the same direction that he came—I got some refreshment and went back to the chambers about twenty minutes before the time he mentioned—in a few minuter he came—he said his brother had not come to town yet and we went together to Billiter-street—he baid he had got a good deal of business to do and he wanted me to do something for him if I would do it—I told him I would do anything that I could do for him—he said it was a thing of great importance and he should not trust me with it only he knew my aunt—he then gave me this paper looking at it —we went on as far as the Commercial-rooms Mincing-lane—I stopped at the bottom of the stairs in the passage—he went up the stairs leaned over the rails and called me up—I went up and he gave me the check for 434l 16s 8d on a little side-board on the landing—he said I was to take great care of it and when I got the money I was to bring it back to him at the same place—he told me there were two or three cashiers and I was to go to the further one on the left-hand side as I went in at the door and if they asked how I wanted it I was to say four 100l -notes and the rest in cash—he gave me the check and a bill-case to put it in—he told me to put the notes in one side of the case and the gold in the other—the staircase up which I went was in the archway—I came out there after I got the check and turned to the left—I asked a gentleman the way and he said he could not direct me—I saw Clark come out of the archway and he came up to me—after he left me I went to the bank and got the check cashed—I came out and met Clark again—I then went to the Commercial-rooms—I took the money on the landing—the person was cot there—I waited about two minutes and the person came up the same way that I had come— when I had left Clark before I went to Commercial-buildings he went on and I lost sight of him within a few yards of Mincing-lane —he asked me if I had done that all right—I told him yes and gave him the bill-case and the money—he looked at the notes but did not count the gold—he gave me half-a-crown and said he was very sorry his brother had not come to town and he did not think he would be there that day but I was to go to the Golden-cross Charing-cross and he would meet me there—I went to the Golden Cross and got there within five or ten minutes of four—I waited some time and the same person came in—he Said he was very sorry his brother had not come to town but he was going to dine with him on the morrow which was Sunday and he would tell him about me and send to me on the Monday—he did not and I went to Lubbock s and told what had taken place Cross-examined Q What age are you A Twenty-one last April—I saw the party at the Golden Cross—I expected to be engaged in the service and from that time I saw nothing of either of the parties till I saw Clark at the Mansion-house—I am still out of place—I have not been supported by the prosecutors—I have not received anything from them since the prisoners have been committed—before that I received 5s I think it was and a half-crown—those are the only sums I have received—I asked for those—none has been offered me—when I left service I had 2l or 3l and I have borrowed money from my father and my sister—I did not find the prosecutors quite ready to let me have as much as I wanted they refused me once—I do not recollect when that was I think it was about two months ago—I think I asked the clerk at Mr Mullens s—I asked Mr Mullens once and he let me have the 5s —I did not ask Mr Mullens again because I was not in particular want of it—I was not promised anything when this matter was over that I swear—they told me they could not give me any money but my expences would be settled when it was over—they did not tell me how much—I did not tell my father or my sister what I expect to get—Clark walked with me to Gracechurch-street after he came out of the passage—we walked together—I noticed him particularly—I noticed the other person likewise—I should know him again—I gave a description of him and of Clark—I described the other man to Mr Mullens a having sore eves and I gave a description of his height—I have not thought since of what height I and—I do not recollect whether it was five feet ten or five feet nine I will not swear that I did not say it was five feet seven—I will not swear whether it was five feet seven five feet nine and a half or five feet ten—I said he had liiiht hair—I am not sure that I did not say he had darkish hair because what I told Mr Mullens I have never thought of since—I told him he had a light over-coat buttoned round him—I told him it was a darkish colour—I never told him it was a frock-coat—I did not tell what hat he had on—it was on Saturday the cheek was cashed and I told on the Thursday following—I saw Mr Mullens again on the same morning that I saw Clark—I do not recollect seeing him between those times—I saw Mr Mullens in his own office he wrote me a letter—I have the letter at home—he did not tell me he had got the party who gave me the check in custody—I did not allude to the letter when I saw Mr Mullens—I asked him if he had got the man—he said he did not know there were two men over at the Mansion-house and I must go and see if there was any one I knew—he did not tell me that those men whom I was to go over to see had been taken with the notes I did not know that—I was not aware to it till they were brought up before the Lord Mayor—I saw them in the private room at the Mansion-house—I should say there were from fifteen to twenty persons in the room with them MR HUDDLLSTON Q Were they in different dresses A Yes—I identified Clark dirt-etly without any one pointing him out or looking—I have had 7s 6d and been out of service since the 17th April TIMOTHY NEWBOILD I am in service

Thursday I received a memorandum in consequence of which I went to the East India Chambers Leadenhall-street on 20th April—I waited in the passage of the chambers and Bradbury came to me—he asked if I was the young person who was to meet him there at two o clock—I said Yes —he asked me to walk with him to the corner of Lime-street which I did and as we walked he said he wanted me for a gentleman whose name was Bird who resided near Bromley in Kent and who was going on the Continent for six or seven months and wanted a servant to go with him and he thought I should suit him—he said he would go and see if Mr Bird was in town but he was afraid he was not as the day had been so wet—he asked me to go to the Custom House and meet him thereat three and at the same time gave me a shilling to get some refreshment—I went to the Custom House at three and met Bradbury at the first door from Billingsgate Market—he said he had been to see and Mr Bird was not come to town but he was authorized by Mr Bird to engage a servant for him—I asked him twenty-two guineas for wages—he said that was twenty-three pounds but I need not be particular the gentleman was a very liberal man and he would as lief give me 25l as 23l —I told him I should have no objection to that but I should be satisfied with twenty-two guineas—I was to meet him on Saturday the 22nd at eleven—I was there at eleven—he did not come till a quarter-past—he said he was in a hurry and he made an appointment to meet him again at one at the middle door at the Custom House and he gave me 6d —I went at one—he did not come till a quarter-past—we walked round to the water-side—he said he had got business at the Docks business at the Custom House and business in the City—he asked me if I could do the business for him in the City—I told him Yes —he said it was a check and rather a heavy one—he said he had a ship lying off the Docks and they could not get it in till he had got the check cashed—he told me to take it and if they asked me who I came from I was to say Messrs Hunt and Co and if they asked me anything further I was to say Mr Thompson had sent me—this is the check he gave me looking at it —it was in a bill-case—he took it out and showed it to me—it is for 371l 7s 4d —he gave me a paper which had on it Three 100l -notes one 50l and 21l 7s 4d in cash —he asked me how long I should be gone—I told him I thought about half an hour unless they detained me—I went to Messrs Lubbocks with the check—they cashed it and I put the notes into the case—I took back the money to Bradbury at the Custom House against the water-side—I gave it to him—he took the notes out of the bill-case and looked at them and I emptied the money out of my own purse and gave it him—he said he had heard from Mr Bird but he would not be in town till four when he would be at Hatchett s Hotel in Piccadilly—he told me to meet him there—he gave me a half-a-crown 6d to get Bradshaw s Guide and 2s for my dinner—he said I was to be there a little before four but he thought he should not be there till a little after—I went there and he came in a cab about twenty minutes past four—I did not see whether there was anybody else in the cab—he said he had just seen a messenger from Bromley and that Mr Bird while hunting in the morning had met with a slight accident and would not be able to come to town till the following Tuesday or Wednesday—he said he must get me to wait till Tuesday or Wednesday to see Mr Bird—he asked me what would satisfy me to keep me till Tuesday or Wednesday that I night not look after anything else—he said he would give me a half sovereign if that would be sufficient—I said I thought it would—he gave me a half-sovereign and as the cab turned round to go towards the City I took the number of it—it was 2268—in consequence of an advertisement I afterwards saw in the paper I went to Mr Mullens and gave information CHARLES CHETHAM LAWRENCE I am clerk in Lubbock and Co s Bank On Saturday 22nd April I cashed this check for 371l 7s 4d —I paid three 100l -notes Nos 42326 45307 and 36137 all dated 10th Jan 1848 a 50l -note No 4253 Portsmouth 23rd Nov and cash 21l 7s 4d WILLIAM HAWES re-examined This check is not my writing nor my brother s nor written by our authority—it bears the number but is not from our check-book ROBERT NEATCH I was a cat-driver The No of my cab was 2268—On 22nd April I was called off the stand in Leadenhall-street by two persons who I believe were the prisoners but I cannot swear positively to either of them—I was to drive them to Leicester-square—when I got to the Strand and was turning up King William-street the taller one of the two put his head out of the door-window and asked me where I was going to—I told him to Leicester-square—he said I said the Golden Cross Charing-cross but never mind put me down at the corner of the next street —I stopped at the corner of Adelaide-street he got out there and told me to take the other gentleman on to Hatchett s Hotel Piccadilly and to bring him back to the Tap at the Golden Cross Charing-cross—I went to Hatchett s Hotel and set gentleman down—he staid about two minutes and when he came out he was talking to a young man—he got into the cab and I drove him to the Golden Cross where the taller one was waiting—the taller one asked if he had paid me—he said No and he paid me 3s 6d Cross-examined Q Am I to understand you to express your belief that these prisoners are either of the persons A I believe them to he both—they are very much like them—I have not said the taller man had black whiskers—I was taken first to the Compter to identify the prisoners—I did not pick out anybody else—I pointed to somebody else—I said there were two that I thought I had identified—I said there were two that I had never seen before and I thought I had seen the other two—I would not swear to any of them—I said I saw so many persons it was quite impossible for me to recognize them J G HELLENBERG re-examined I am Commissary of Police at Brussels On 25th April I went to the station of the Northern Railway at Brussels—I saw the two prisoners—they took tickets for Ostend—I asked them for their passports—Bradbury said lie had none but Clark had one from Belgium—told them to accompany me to the Police station—I asked Bradbury what his profession was—he and Clark both said they were gentlemen and said they lived in London—Bradbury said he lived in Montague-street Russell-square Cross-examined Q Were these answers given to questions which you were compelled by the laws of Belgium to ask A les—the persons over there are sworn RICHARD MULLENS I am one of the firm of Bush and Mullens solicitors to the bankers of London In consequence of directions I went over to Brussels on 1st May—I was present on 4th May when an examination of the two prisoners took place before some legal authorities—Clark was examined first—before any questions were put to him by the Commissary there a caution was given to him on my suggestion—the Magistrate said Do you recollect what you have already stated about this affair of the bank-notes —Clark said I do —the Magistrate then said I wish to put some further questions to you which you may answer or not just as you please — he spoke in French but there was a sworn interpreter there who translated what the Magistrate said to Clark —the Magistrate stated that in the terms I have used—Clark said he was ready to answer—I have a note here for 50l No 4253 23rd Nov Portsmouth and a 100l note No 24181 18th Aug 1847—these notes were shown to Clark and he was asked if he recognised them as the notes that had been taken from his person at the moment of his arrest—he examined the notes and said they were—he was asked on what part of his person they were found—he said in the inside pocket of his flannel uaistcoat—he was asked why he carried the notes in such a place—he said he had once lost a large sum of money and ever since that time he had always carried his money in a more secure place in the inside of his waistcoat—he was then asked where he got these two notes from—he said he had them from his companion Bradbury—he was then asked what notes he had changed in Brussels out of the notes which were then lying on the table six notes and one 50l they are all here—he said I changed one of these and after looking at them he selected this note No 24180 dated 18th Aug 1847 Newcastle—he said I changed that for 118 Frederic d ors that is my own I changed that at a money-changers —he was then asked if he claimed any of the other notes which were lying on the table—he said No these do not belong to me —he was asked how he became acquainted with Bradbury—he said he never saw him before they met at Dover—he was then asked where he got the 100l -note which iie acknowledged he had changed—he said from a person at Dover to whom he gave small notes for it—he was then shown the Times newspaper of 28th April in which the numbers of the notes appeared including No 24180—after noticing that he looked at the note again and said If that note is in that advertisement I am sure that is not the note that I changed —he was then asked what note it was he would acknowledge to have changed—he said The note I changed was dated 1847 but it was an older note and I think rumpled —he was then asked where he got the notes from which he had given in exchange for the 100l note at Dover—he said I cannot say where I got those notes but I could if I had my book —he was asked where his books were—he said they were at home—he was asked where his home was—he said I will not say where that is because I should disgrace my family —he was then asked whether he knew who the person was from whom he received the 100l note—he said he did not he had met the person by accident on the Quay at Dover—his attention was called to some notes which had been taken from his person but there were other notes produced which were brought by different money-changers in Brussels—Bradbury was then called in and the same caution was given to him that had been given to Clark and translated in the same way by the interpreter—his attention was directed to the whole of the notes that I have produced to-day Nos 45307 42326 36137 38273 2 180 24181—he said I received them from Mr Bullock 114 Yardley-sreet King s-road Chelsea he gave them to me on Saturday 22nd April on the Quay at Dover the property which has been seized by the police is not mine but Mr Bullock s I received them on the Quay and at the same time seven 100l notes these are the notes—that is my writing—I know them by that —the name J H Bradbury was written on several of them—he said The 50l note found on Clark I gave him —he was asked whether the note 4253 was the same—he said I should not like to claim it but I suppose it must be mine —he said I gave Bullock fifty sovereigns for it —he made that observation on being shown the advertisement in the news-paper—the Magistrate asked him whether he had not made a mistake in saying Mr Bullock had given it him and whether it was not Mr Lubbock gave it him—he answered that laughing and said No —Mr Bullock had given it him—he said Mr Bullock was in the Manchester trade that he was then on the Rhine that Mr Bullock gave him the notes to get changed for him and to take the proceeds to England—he said he believed he had something to do in the smuggling way that he himself had been a smuggler for some time—he said he lived in Montague-street Russell-square but would not state the number Cross-examined Q Bradbury was shown the whole of the notes you have here A Yes—these are the whole of the notes that have been found as the result of the forgeries—there is one note that we have not yet found—we know in what quarter it is gone—it is gone up the Rhine—Clark said there was another note—I am not aware of it—one of the money-changers was not sure whether Clark had changed two notes or one—he said he had taken two 100l notes about the same time and he was not certain whether they both came from the same person—3170 francs were given up to Clark—they amounted to about 125l —100l was supposed to be the proceeds of a note changed at Brussels—he was put on board the steam-boat by the Belgium authorities—part of the money was taken from him by Forrester JOHN FORRESTER I am an officer I took the prisoners in custody on 7th May on board the Soho steamer—I found some money on each of the prisoners—I made inquiry for a person named Bullock and I looked for Yardley-strect Chelsea—I could not find any such place or any person of the name of Bullock there or anywhere CHARLES CHADBURY I live in Regent-street City-road Basin I know the prisoner Clark—he went under the name of Perkins when he lived at 20 Wharf City-road Basin ten or eleven years ago Cross-examined Q Are you sure he is the same man A Yes—I do not know what he was—he occupied a house and stable and had a little horse COURT Q Did you ever know him answer to the name of Perkins A Oh yes many a time J G HELLENKERG re-examined Q Did you find anything besides the notes on Clark A Yes some whiskers and some green spectacles—I asked him why he wore them—he said To frighten children if you life up the wig which he wears you will find an eye to hold this hook on these whiskers MARTHA FOX I live at 29 Wharf City-basin I know Clark—he lived twelve years ago in the house I occupy—he went under the name of Perkins William Tunnell a watchmaker at Deptford and John Potts a hairdresser gave Clark a good character CLARK— GUILTY

t18480703-1766  1766 EDWIN SMITH feloniously forging and uttering an order for the payment of 57l 10s with intent to defraud Henry Bosanquet and others MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution EDWARD ALFRKD GRATTAN I am cashier at the Southwark Branch of the London and Westminster Bank—Henry Bosanquet and others are the proprietors—Mr James Dobson of High-street Borough is a customer—on 27th June this check looking at it was brought by the prisoner—I suspected it and asked him from whom he obtained it—he said Mr Matthews sent him to obtain the money—I asked him what Mr Matthews was—he said a builder or a carpenter—I took him into the Manager s room a policeman was sent for and he was given in custody—the policeman asked where he got the check—he said a gentleman over the way at Wallis s coffee-house gave it him to obtain the money and gave him a shilling for his trouble—he said the gentleman had a white waistcoat and he could give no other description of him—he produced a canvas bag which he said the gentleman had given him to put the money in Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q It was some difference in the writing to that of Mr Dobson which marie you suspect it A Yes MICHAEL GROGAN policeman 145 M The prisoner was given into my custody with this check—he said a gentleman with a white waistcoat at Wallis s coffee-house had promised him a shilling to go and get it cashed and take the money back to him—I accompanied him to Wallis s coffee-house and found no gentleman there—I took the prisoner to the station and on searching I found this other check in his jacket pocket Cross-examined Q How do you know it was his jacket A He told me so—he told me where he lived—I searched his office and found it there JAMES DOBSON I am a clothier in the Borough—I keep an account at the Southwark Branch of the London and Westminster Bank—the prisoner was in my service about six months back from four to six months—I have frequently sent him to the bankers to take cash—this check is not my writing nor the slightest imitation of it—on my engaging the prisoner I asked him to sign his name which he did but that was not sufficient for me to form a judgment of his hand-writing—he was requested to write at the Court and from the signature at the Court I should say this check is his writing—it is very like it—when this was first handed to me I said I must refer to my books to see if I could find any corresponding writing—I have since seen his writing which was similar to this but it was written very badly—I have not sufficient information to form a belief abont it—this order for a check-book I can only make the same reply about it is not my writing—I did not desire any person to go for a check-book on that day—the remark I was pressed to make at the Court was unfairly taken from me—I stated I had not sufficient authority to speak to the writing I must see some corresponding writing Cross-examined Q Do you entertain the same doubt about the writing of this other check found in his jacket A The writing of that is similar to this—the prisoner was merely my errand-boy—I had a good character with him JOHN FREDERICK SHERRIFF I am one of the cashiers of the London and Westminster Bank in the Borough On the 26th June this note was brought to the banking-house—I gave the person who brought it a blank check-book No 10063—that number would go through the whole book—I have no doubt the prisoner is the person Cross-examined Q Had you ever seen him before A Yes—my attention was called to this fact on 27th June the day after I gave him the check-book—he presented the check on the 27th—his face was familiar to me he having come from Mr Dobson s before COURT Q Is the check produced a check taken from that book A Yes— check read June 27 1848—London and Westminster Bank Southwark Branch 3 Wellington-street—Pay Mr Matthews or bearer 57l 10s —James Dobson James Knight a chemist and druggist at Stones-end in the Borough gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY of uttering Aged 15 —Recommended to mercy by the Jury — Transported for Seven Years ADJOURNED TO MONDAY AUGUST 21ST 1848

t18480821-1848  1848 ROBERT GORDON feloniously transposing a certain mark used by the Goldsmith s Company —Other COUNTS varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS CLARKSON and HUDDLESTON conducted the Prosecution ALEXANDER HALLEY Esq M D I live at 46A Queen Anne-street Cavendish-square I know the prisoner—in March or April last he kept a shop in Great Russell-street Bloomsbury as a working-silversmith—I employed him to make me the top of a sporran or Highland purse—I ordered it to be made of silver—I went and saw it at his shop before it was sent home—I remarked to him that it looked yellow and said I wished to have the hall-mark on it that I might be certain it was silver—it was brought home about a fortnight or three weeks after—I saw the prisoner when I paid him—I said to him I suppose it is good silver as there are marks on it —he said yes—I have got the bill and receipt—I paid him 4l 10s for the sporran and tassels but he had more as there were various articles—this is the sporran produced —it is worn in front of a Highland dress—I paid for it as silver Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Where did you order it A At Gordon s shop—I did not bargain about the price before it was made—I said I wished the price to be moderate—I have seen the witness Johnson at Gordon s shop—he may have been present at the time the conversation took place about the hall-mark I do not recollect whether he was or not—it came home early in May—the first notice I had of its not being pure silver was from Goldsmith s-hall—they received information and sent to me for it about three weeks or a month ago—this was the first transaction I had with Gordon—I am a Scotchman—he was recommended to me as patronized by the Highland Society JEREMIAH FULLER I am chief assayer of the Goldsmiths Company I received this purse on 2nd Aug for the purpose of being assayed—I assayed it—it is not silver—the ingredients of standard silver are 1loz 2 dwts of fine silver to 18 dwts of copper in the 12oz lb —this is 2oz 18 dwts worse than standard—the Goldsmiths Company would not permit the mark to have been put on such an article as this as silver—it would be base metal—it is the practice if anything of this sort is brought there which is not up to standard to break it to pieces Cross-examined Q It would be one-eighth or one-ninth part less valuable than if it was standard silver A Considerably less than standard—standard silver would be 5s to the ounce and this is about 3s 8d —it is only those persons that have their punches entered at the company who can get the mark put on—I am not aware that the prisoner is one nor Johnson—there are a good many working silversmiths not entered at the company who get a friend who has his name entered to get things marked for them—the company first had information about this on 1st Aug and I went to Dr Halley—I got my information from the solicitor of the company—I do not know where he got his information from—I have not seen Johnson at the hall MR CLARKSON Q When an article is manufactured may it be sent into the world without bearing the mark of the company A No—those who have not punches frequently submit their goods to those who have them to get them marked—I have no doubt of this being a proper mark of the company s COURT Q How long have you been assayer to the company A About eight years—I have become acquainted with the marks—I should call this a mark let in transposed pointing it out —this is not the mark for an article of this description it would be the mark for a spoon—according to the quantity of copper used in the metal it would be more or less yellow JOSIAH SHARPE ESQ I am deputy-warden of the Goldsmiths Company I have examined the rim of the mounting of this purse—it is not such a mark as is used for this species of article but for tea-spoons and other small spoons—the letter I in old English is on it—that letter is used to denote the year in which the article is stamped—that is not the proper letter for the present year—it was used last on 29th May 1845—a different letter is used every year—the proper mark for such an article as this would have been altogether different—part of the marks would have been put on the front of the clasp and part on the back to prevent the possibility of a part of this being made use of and attached to a piece not hall marked and there would also have teen a small mark on each of the mountings of the tassels and all the small movable pieces—the mark on the front would have been the lion passant and the leopard s head—I believe this mark has been let in Cross-examined Q What mark is on it now A The lion passant the letter for the year the leopard s head and the Queen s bead—if it was properly marked the Queen s head and the letter would have been placed on the other side—the lion s head and the leopard s head would be there but all the marks would be differently arranged—an ordinary working silversmith ought to know that this was not the correct mark—if he is in the habit of sending manufactured work to Goldsmiths Hall he must know it or if he was in the habit of making articles of this description—we do not mark very many of these in a year—the prisoner s name is not entered at the hall nor is Johnson s—I knew nothing of them before—it was Johnson who gave me the information COURT Q Do you put the Queen s head on all articles A Yes and the leopard and the letter for the year but the difference is in the arrangement—this mark would not be used for large spoons—tea-spoons are marked by a press at a single blow but such articles as these are marked by punches put on by hand with a hammer JAMES JOHNSON I am a working-jeweller and live at 20 Vere-street Lincoln s-inn-fields I knew the prisoner at Edinburgh and worked as a shopmate with him there—I met him in London about two years ago and since then have at times assisted him in his work—I remember the order of Dr Halley for the sporran—I went into Gordon s shop just after he had got the order for it—he said he was rather busy and would I assist him in making the purse—I said I would—this is it—I got the metal from Gordon—I was in the shop when Dr Halley called about it—it was not then finished—the doctor said that he wanted it made of good silver that he did not think it was silver and he wanted it hall marked—the top part of it was mounted at that time except two little bits at the side—the chasing was on it before it went to be mounted—after Dr Halley had left Gordon said that he would get a tea-spoon and take the stamp from that and solder it in—he asked me to do it—I said I would not do such a thing for 50l —I said he had much better break it up and get a good one at once—I knew at that time that it was not proper metal—I laid it down and went away—that was about six o clock at night—I went back in the morning and the stamp was in it— I had mounted it before that—I made all the silver part of it except the chasing —Gordon asked me if it was not done very neatly—I think I made the same remark that I did before that I would not do the same thing for a good sum of money—when it was finished I accompanied the prisoner to Dr Halley s door and handed the purse to a servant with the bill—I did not get paid for it—about a fortnight after I had a quarrel with the prisoner and left him—it was somewhere in May that Dr Halley called—I took the purse home between two and three days and a week after that Cross-examined Q How long did you remain in the prisoner s employment after taking the purse home A I was never in his employment except just assisting him for a day now and then—I was paid for my assistance—it was while I was working for him that we quarrelled—I think it was about the middle of June—when I had nothing else to do I used to go and help him for an hour or two—that went on for about eighteen months—I never asked for payment till I was entirely out of work—I have not been out of work till lately—I was employed by Mr Mosely of Fetter-lane—I have left him thirteen weeks—I tried to get work after that but was not successful—I have very good references from persons who know me very well—I never was in a court of justice before—I was brought up as a jeweller at Edinburgh—I left there three years ago to better my circumstances that was my only reason—there is a goldsmith s company in Edinburgh—I had no quarrel with them—I was never informed against for defrauding the Edinburgh company of stamps—I was never a pedlar—I was a working-jeweller in business for myself and employed by customers in the country—I went from town to town—I did not go about with a pack I had a box—I did not take out a hawker s licence—I had a plate licence—they asked me about it at Haddington and when I showed it they told me I was perfectly justified in what I was doing—I was not hawking I was supplying the trade—I was not convicted for hawking without a licence—I know a Mr Shanks of Edinburgh—he did not give me some goods to show to Lord Weymess at Gosport-house—I had goods from him and he from me to show at different places—I never pawned any of his goods—I know Mr Boston and Mr Brown jewellers at Edinburgh—I did not pawn any goods of theirs—I had a shop in Leith-street—I did not succeed and became a bankrupt and Mr Shanks and Mr Boston both went and pledged some articles in my name and left me the duplicates of them to take them out if I could—I have got a line from Mr Shanks showing that he received them from my hands—they did it for the purpose of lending me the money—it was at the time my stock was being sold off—I mean that they pledged their own goods in my name to lend me the money— looking at a paper I think this is Mr Shanks writing—I swear I did not get 20l worth of goods from Mr Shanks to show at Gosport-house and undertake they should be returned if not sold and then pawn them—I cannot say that I know these pawn-tickets produced —I see my name on them—they were in my possession—they were the pawntickets of the goods pledged by Boston and Shanks in my name to lend me the money—I never had it in my power to repay them—they got the duplicates from my wife in my absence—my wife is alive now—I have unfortunately had more than one wife—they were not alive at one time—my wife lives with me now and my family at 20 Vere-street—I was not present when Dr Halley gave the order for the purse—I was present when he came and said it was to be hall-marked—I had about 7s 6d for making it not 18s —I do not know a man named Wood— Wood was here called in —I do not know him by sight—I did not bargain with the prisoner and say I would make the purse-top and get it hall-marked for 18s —I did not tell him at any time that I would get it hall-marked for any price—I never offered to get it hall-marked—I cannot recollect the prisoner paying me some money at a public-house in May—I got 13s or 13s 6d from him in his shop one Saturday night and at the time I left I had a few shillings—I had 2s 3s or 4s at other times—I cannot recollect that I ever received 10s at a public-house—I cannot swear I did not—I have been at the Tavistock Arms in Great Russell-street several times—I do not recollect receiving 10s from him there nor did he say This is for making Dr Halley s purse and for Hailing it and as you have received 5s or 6s already I shall settle the balance to-morrow —I do not recollect that that took place at the Tavistock Arms in the presence of Wood who was called in—I do not think it happened—he said nothing of the kind—I have not threatened to shoot or to murder the prisoner—I know Mr Evans a surgeon—I did not tell the prisoner in Mr Evans presence that I would murder him nor did I tell Mr Evans that I would murder the prisoner—there were words on 28th July between me and the prisoner in a public meeting—I might then have said something about ruining him—he did everything he could to injure me—I did not say I would murder him—I have got goods hall-marked in Scotland—I never got things hall-marked for Gordon—I never made up any goods for myself in London nor for any other person—my employers always sent tne work to be hall-marked—I have not seen persons bring goods to Gordon hall-marked—I believe he used to get his refiner Mr Wilby to get his goods hall-marked—Wilby never got anything marked for me—I do not know Anderson silversmith at Edinburgh—I was not employed by him COURT Q Was your quarrel with Gordon about the settling of your accounts A No I was working with him at the time—I left off work that day and went back two days after to settle accounts—the quarrel was about a diamond snap that was brought to the shop by a piper named Mackenzie—I made no demand of money of the prisoner—he electro-plated some few things for me after our quarrel and that took up the amount of money due and left me in his debt 2s or 2s 6d —I have not paid that—I have not had it in my power or I would have done so—I did not communicate this matter at Goldsmiths Hall in order to be revenged on him—he traduced and assailed my character about the town and I made this communication to be revenged on him—there were no other workmen assisting Gordon while the purse was made—it was made in his shop—I got the metal from Gordon—I do not know where it was melted—it was chased before I had it MR PARNELL called CHARLES HERBERT WOOD I am a pearl engraver and keep a house at 20 John-street Westminster I have known the prisoner upwards of two years and a half—during that time he has borne a very good character for honesty and respectability—he has done near 100l worth of work for me as a mounter—I know his shop—a great part of his work he sends out to be done—I know Johnson—I was at Gordon s shop as Dr Halley went out from giving the order for the purse—I was outside the door and came in as Dr Halley came out—Johnson was there COURT Q Can you point out Dr Halley A I cannot because I was not in the shop when he was there—I was going in and when I saw the gentleman in the shop I went outside and remained there because my business was private—I cannot tell whether he was a tall or a short man he was not particularly tall—I think he was rather stout—I cannot exactly recollect for I never saw him before MR PARNELL Q Was there a conversation going on when you went in A Yes between Mr and Mrs Gordon and Johnson—Dr Halley s name was mentioned—I heard Johnson say he would make the purse-top and get it hall-marked for 18s —I was at the Tavistock Arms on Friday 26th May—Johnson and Gordon were there—I saw Gordon pay Johnson 10s Q Did you hear Gordon say This is for making Dr Halley s purse and for Halling it and as you have had 5s or 6s already I shall settle the balance to-morrow A Yes COURT Q What was it that was said A Johnson said I want some money Gordon —he said What do you want —Johnson said What can you let me have —Gordon said I Can let you have 10s you have had some during the week what have you had —Johnson said 5s —Gordon said Then I can let you have 10s and if you will come to-morrow night I will let you have the remainder —that was all MR PARNELL Q Did he say what it was for A Yes—he asked what he had done with the receipt and he said the doctor was not at home but he had left the bill and brought the receipt back—I think he said the 10s was in part payment for making the purse but I will not be positive—he said You have had 5s already on the purse and if I give you 10s will that do —he said Yes and he should have the remainder to-morrow—this occurred at Mr Davis s the Tavistock Arms where we generally go—nothing was said about the mark on the purse at the time - - MR GREGOR I am a sadler and harness-maker at 79 Berwick-street Soho I was with Gordon and Johnson on 26th May at a public-house in Great Russell-street nearly opposite Gordon s shop and as they were leaving I saw Gordon put some money into Johnson s hand—I do not know what it was—I heard nothing said—I have known Gordon about two years—all the transactions I have had with him have been most honorable and I have heard every one say the same John Clark teacher of music 5

conducted the Prosecution THOMAS WEBB GREEN Esq I am a barrister and am one of the directors of the Medical Legal and General Mutual Life-Assurance Society to which the prisoner filled the situation of secretary and actuary from 1846 when it was completely registered—he had been employed previously to that—in consequence of circumstances that attracted the attention of the directors the prisoner was suspended I think on 18th April—I went through the accounts with him on 24th April after his suspension—he had the account of premiums and the interest account—I went through the interest account with him—this is the ledger— produced —at page 136 here is an entry headed Interest on Shares —amongst the entry of paid dividends here is a dividend entered as paid to Dr Chalmers—I do not think I called over these names to the prisoner—I had been through the account previously by myself and I said to him Mr Morris here are several entries here of money paid for interest for which I have no vouchers —he said The vouchers I think are in the iron safe —this paper looking at one is the form of a receipt used in reference to the payment of dividends due on 31st Dec —this account in the book refers to dividends due at that period—this form is a voucher to our bakers who pay it—this came to us as one of the vouchers for the paid dividends—this to the best of my recollection is one of the vouchers which I found in the iron safe—I had possessed myself of them before though the prisoner did not know it—there were other payments entered in the book for which no vouchers were found—there was a further investigation the prisoner s attention was called to it and he resigned—the directors accepted his resignation—the filling up of this receipt is in the prisoner s handwriting and here is his signature to it as attesting witness to its genuineness—the prisoner putting his name would be to attest the correctness of the document and that the signature is that of the person receiving the dividend but not that saw him sign it—this document being taken to Messrs Praed s would be paid as a check and come back to us as our voucher—the bankers would not pay it without the prisoner s signature—here is an account for Stallard 1l 5s T W Fletcher 5l Davies 2l 10s and Richard Hey of 3l 2s 6d —these others are similar documents purporting to be signed in the same way all filled up by the prisoner and witnessed by him Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You have referred to the ledger in which there is reference to half-yearly dividends being paid to Dr chalmers in whose handwriting is it A The handwriting of Nixon the clerk —the name of Fletcher and the whole account is in the writing of Nixon I believe—when I read over the ledger to the prisoner I read the items put in by Nixon—the deed of settlement directs the books to be kept by the prisoner—Nixon was a clerk in the office and he had access to the strong box—it was the duty of the secretary and actuary to keep the key—Nixon would only get it by applying to him—I think there was no counterfoil to these vouchers kept—the prisoner never made a representation to me that there should be a counterfoil—the prisoner did not make the Company—I should think it was made by the medical gentlemen I do not know that he was their agent—when these became vouchers they were filled up and kept in a bundle—I do not know where they were kept in blank—the prisoner was the resident actuary if he were absent Nixon remained in the office—the prisoner went an excursion in Aug 1846—I had occasion to reprimand him once when he was absent a whole day—Nixon remained in the outer office—the receipts were to be made out when they became due if an application were made for them they would be paid if the actuary were there—I do not know that these receipts were left unsigned—I have never known them to be left filled up—an account was made out of who the dividends were to be paid to—I do not know that with the exception of the word witness these forms were left out filled up in possession of any person in the office— Form read — Received the 5th of Feb 1848 of the Medical Legal and General Life Insurance Society 3l 2s 6d for half a year s interest due 31st of Dec 1847 —Signed WILLIAM CHALMERS proprietor Witness R W MORRIS —these receipts never ought to have been given but by the defendant—there was not another clerk under Nixon—there was a messenger called Richard who is in the office now—I never heard that Nixon and Richard had a key of the strong box—they had no authority to have such a key—Nixon left on 2nd May—he was called to account and resigned—his resignation was accepted—he confessed to the directors that he had received a premium which he had not entered—I suppose he pocketed the money—these forms were kept filled up but the witness ought to be put to it only at the time of the application Q Suppose an application had been made to Nixon and the proprietor got this form and left his signature when the defendant came and saw this and believed it to be William Chalmer s signature he would be entitled to sign it A Yes—if he believed it to be his signature—Dr Chalmers would take this to the banker s and there receive the money if it had the actuary s signature to it—I do not know that our actuary has been in the habit of advancing the money instead of giving these orders—I have not sanctioned his cashing these orders he would have no authority to do it—it would prevent there being a check from the banker s—if a customer were to say Will you be kind enough to give me the money for this if he were to do so he would do it on his own authority because we should have the document Q Was he never authorized to issue these with his own name as witness previous to the signature of the proprietor A No but in two instances my mother-in-law and sister could not attend for their dividend I received it for them and guaranteed to the directors the genuineness of their signatures—those were the only two instances—I cannot charge my memory whether the prisoner signed them before I got the signatures of my relations attached to them or afterwards—I did not request him to send one of these documents witnessed to Mr Dolman or to anvbody else—Mr Dolman has a brother residing in London who is a medical practitioner and I made an application that the brother in the country might receive it through his brother—I have not taken any step to produce Nixon here—I have suggested that it was right he should be here—I heard you intimate that he Nixon was probably the person who had committed these acts MR BODKIN Q Do you know that in consequence of that suggestion a subpœna has been issued and an endeavour made to find Nixon A I believe it has—I did not in the instance of those two relations of mine ask the prisoner to put his name before they had signed but he trusted to me—if he did it he did it knowing me to be a director—I firmly believe the signatures of Hey and Fletcher to these documents to be the prisoner s hand-writing MR BALLANTINE Q You have no doubt that the signature R W Morris is his writing A No doubt of that—I have no doubt that the writing of the body of both these documents is his—I am not equally sure about the signatures of the proprietors I speak to it from my belief—I cannot divest myself of the belief that it is his writing—I have not heard that this has been shown to the messenger and that he has declared it is not his writing—these signatures are not the prisoner s genuine writing it is a feigned hand—I believe that from the general knowledge of the character of his writing—I have seen it for two years—it approaches very nearly to his ordinary writing—I have the same reason for my belief in the character of Fletcher s signature—I have the same belief of that from the character of his writing—I should say the D in Davies in this signature is so very peculiar in the formation that I could almost stake my belief on that only—I know that the body and the indorsement are his writing—I am not sure that I did not see him write this indorsement in Mr Hey s case JURY Q You cannot mistake it for Nixon s writing A Oh dear no—Nixon s is a schoolmaster s handwriting ROBERT HENRY WELDON I am an assistant in the banking-bouse of Messrs Praed of Fleet-street bankers to the Medical Legal and General Mutual Life-Assurance Society On 5th Feb I paid the amount of this order over the counter—I do not know to whom WILLIAM CHALMERS ESQ M D I reside at Croydon I am a shareholder of the Medical Legal and General Life-Assurance Society—the signature to this order is not my writing—I did not authorize any person to sign it for me—I executed the deed of settlement—this is my signature to the deed looking at it —the prisoner witnessed the execution of this instrument Cross-examined Q Is this signature to the order like your handwriting A No—anybody who had seen my handwriting would see this was not mine THOMAS WILLIAM FLETCHER I am a proprietor of the Medical Legal and General Life-Assurance Society The signature to this document is not my writing or written by my authority or knowledge Cross-examined Q Is it like your writing A Not at all—I believe the secretary saw me sign the deed of settlement RICHARD HEY I am a proprietor of shares in this insurance office The signature to this receipt is not my writing nor written by my authority—I did not receive my interest till lately—this is not like my handwriting FRANCIS DAVIES I am a shareholder in this insurance office The signature

sign my name could not be deceived by it—I have seen the prisoner several times—I was acquainted with him Cross-examined Q Then he knew your writing perfectly well A I should think he must have done it - - QUAIL I am one of the directors of this institution I am acquainted with the prisoner s handwriting—I have seen him write often—the signature to this receipt in the name of Fletcher I believe was written by the prisoner Cross-examined Q You have had your attention called to the others I suppose you believe them to be the prisoner s too A Not all of them—I cannot say that this signature to Mr Stallard s is the prisoner s writing—I believe it not to be his but I cannot say—I see nothing in it to make me believe it is his and it is further off Nixon s writing than the prisoner s—I do not think it is the writing of either—this signature to this of Mr Davies I believe to be the prisoner s—it has some likeness to what I remember of his writing—I believe it to be his as well as I can judge—I believe this signature to Mr Fletcher s is not his ordinary handwriting—I do not consider this signature to Mr Davies s to be his ordinary handwriting—I have never seen him write a feigned hand—I cannot say anything about this signature of Dr Chalmers s—it appears to be a feigned hand—I have not the least idea that it is his—this signature to Mr Hey s is more like his but I cannot say that it is his—I was never called to give an opinion about handwriting before—I believe I should know my own writing if I saw it WILLIAM JOHN LITTLE I am one of the directors of this company—I have frequently seen the prisoner write—I have a strong belief that the signature to this receipt signed in the name of Mr Davis is the prisoner s writing—I have a belief that this signature to Mr Hey s receipt is the prisoner s writing—I have the same beliet concerning this signature to Mr Fletcher s—I have no notion that any of them are the writing of Nixon Cross-examined Q Show me the receipts of Mr Davis Mr Hey and Mr Fletcher do you believe these to be his writing A I do—I have seen him write very frequently—I have received many letters from him—these are very like his own handwriting—to a certain extent I think them all disguised—I think they are his natural handwriting slightly disguised—I should have no doubt whatever in looking at these signatures that they were his—they are not written with the same freedom as his natural writing—though slightly disguised I have no doubt they are his DR VARLO I am one of the Directors of this Company I have seen the prisoner write—I have received several notes from him—I believe this receipt purporting to be signed by Mr Hey is the prisoner s writing—I have a strong belief that this purporting to be signed by Mr Fletcher is the prisoner s—neither of them resemble Nixon s writing Cross-examined Q Nixon was a clever person A He had a facility of writing some forms of writing—he wrote a heavy hand—I did not observe that he wrote differently—he wrote a good book-keeping hand not a free hand—he was in the outer office and the prisoner in an inner one—if any one came their first application would be to Nixon and he would speak to the actuary—I have received several dividends from the prisoner never from Nixon—I never asked the prisoner to cash one for me—I never knew any one do so—on one occasion when I had to pay a premium I did not pay the full premium but merely the balance of the difference between the interest and the premium RICHARD PARTRIDGE I am a surgeon and am one of the directors of this institution I am acquainted with the prisoner s writing—I believe the signature to this receipt of Mr Hey s is the prisoner s writing and this of Mr Fletcher also Cross-examined Q Are these what you call his natural writing A Not quite—there is some concealment about them but there is a strong character of his writing—I had a letter from the prisoner—it was shown me to-day by one of the witnesses—it brought the subject of the letter I cannot say that it brought the character of his writing to my mind—the answers I have given are founded on my knowledge of his writing THOMAS WEBB GREEN re-examined Q Open the ledger at any part where there is a considerable portion of Nixon s writing A Here is folio 36 which is all Nixon s in his ordinary writing—I have never seen him write any other hand—he writes formally not quickly—it is the handwriting of a schoolmaster—both he and the prisoner left on the 2nd May—the prisoner did not go out of the house that day but he ceased from his office Cross-examined Q Did the prisoner himself make complaints to the Society of the misconduct of Nixon A On one or two occasions he complained of his being dilatory and late—he did not do all that he could to get Nixon turned away to my knowledge—I have an impression that on one or two occasions Nixon s conduct in not opening the office till late and not keeping the windows clean and so on were made subjects of complaint THOMAS DYSON I am an assistant in the Commercial Bank of London in Henrietta-street In Feb last the prisoner kept an account there—on 18th Feb I have an entry to the prisoner s account amounting to 35l 15s —it was composed of different drafts as follows 1l 5s 2l 10s 1l 5s 1l 5s 1l 5s 2l 10s 2l 10s 3l 2s 6d 3l 12s 6d 12s 6d 5l and 3l 2s 6d —these amongst others made up 35l 15s paid in to his credit—I think the whole amount paid in were drafts on Praed and Co with the exception of 3l—these three drafts bear the stamp of our Bank denoting they were paid in there JAMES WHITING I am a clerk in the Commercial Bank Henrietta-street I received cash for those checks at Praed s on 18th Feb The Rev Mr Meakin of Berkshire Mr Ikes an accountant of Clapham Mr Fowler a solicitor of Litchfield and Mr Gifford a supervisor of Excise gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 27 — Transported for Ten Years There were five other indictments against the

and SIR JOHN BAYLEY conducted the Prosecution JOHN HITCHES In Oct last I was barman at Mr Potter s the White Horse High-street Shoreditch I usually go by the name of George—I had known the prisoner by sight for about three months before 25th Oct last—I have seen him at our house several times—on 25th Oct I noticed him leaning against the counter there at nearly three o clock—he was in one of the boxes with which the bar is fitted up—there was a man with him in the same box—they were there when I came down from dinner and about five minutes after that the prisoner spoke to me and said George I want you I have something to show you —he said that gently—I asked him what it was and he said it was a note—I did not see anything in his hand at the time—I asked him what it was about if he could not read it—he said it was a 5l -note and if I would come outside he would show it me—I said I could not come out I had my business to attend to —he then spoke to the man with him and I afterwards explained to Mr Potter who was in the bar what had happened—I then spoke to the prisoner again and I asked him to give me the note and I would take it into the yard and look at it—he gave me three notes and said There is three of them —I took them into the yard to look at them and called Mr Potter—I gave them into his hands and he took the numbers of them—I called them out to him one at a time—he then gave them back to me and I put them into my pocket—I returned to to the bar again—the prisoner was there and the man with him—I asked the prisoner what he wanted for the notes—he said I could have the three for 12l or one for 4l —I asked him where he got them—the man was with him at the time and they both answered at one time and said I found them opposite Bishopsgate Church —I told the prisoner that I did not want them —the other man went out directly after—I asked the prisoner where he was gone to and he said he was just gone outside—he came in again in about five minutes—he went out again in two or three minutes—I asked the prisoner where he was gone and he said he was gone to get some dinner at the cook-shop—I said Is he not come back yet —he said No I will go and fetch him if you like —I said he had better not go perhaps he would be back again—I said I wished him to come back again before I gave him the notes —the notes were quite new clean and folded up when the prisoner handed them to me—they were much cleaner then they are now— looking at them —about ten minutes after the other man went out the second time the policeman Taylor came in and asked me in the prisoner s presence if I was the young man that bad had any notes offered me—I said Yes —I had the three notes in my possession at the time—Taylor asked the prisoner if he was the man that bad offered the notes—he said Yes and he took him into custody and we all three went to the station—on our way there we met police-sergeant Eves to whom I gave the notes—they had not been out of my sight since the prisoner gave them me Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What sort of a man was the man hat was with the prisoner A A short dark Jewish looking man—the prisoner remained ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after he had gone away—he went out and in twice—I cannot say how long it was after that man came into the house that the policeman came—he had been there perhaps a quarter of an hour twenty minutes or it might be half an hour after I came down stairs—I only knew the prisoner by sight—I did not know his name—I do not know that his mother or any relation nursed Mrs Potter—he has been at the house several times—I looked at them both when I asked where they got the notes and both said they picked them up—I never saw the prisoner write JAMES POTTER I keep the White Horse Shoreditch On 25th Oct about three o clock in the afternoon I observed the prisoner standing close to the counter leaning over as though he wanted to speak to some one—there was one man behind him and another drinking a glass of ale at the side—thinking they were waiting to be served I directed Ritches to serve them—he said that they had been served—he came to me shortly after and I asked what the man wanted and he said he had some notes that he wanted to show him—the prisoner could not hear that—Ritches came to me with a newspaper in his hand that the men should not think that he came to speak to me about the notes—I directed him to get the notes to take the numbers and see if they were correct—he got them and showed them to me in the yard they were perfectly new—I took the numbers and dates of them—these three produced are them—I am in the habit of taking a great many notes and I knew that these were not genuine by the paper—in consequence of that I told Ritches to hold conversation with him privately and not pay any attention to other customers till I went for a constable—I told him to keep the notes—I then went into the street and observed five other persons going in and out into the bos adjoining where the prisoner was and two or three others going into the other box and listening over the partition to hear what passed between Ritches and the prisoner—they appeared to watch to see what we determined to do—I was waiting for a constable I had sent for—Taylor came and I communicated the circumstances to him and pointed out the other persons to him but he did not seem to take so much interest in the matter as I considered he would have done—I afterwards directed him to take the prisoner into custody—the other man came out of the door as I was speaking to Taylor HENRY TAYLOR policeman H 91 On 25th Oct last I went to the White Horse—I went into a private box and asked Ritches in the prisoner s hearing if he bad had any notes offered to him—he said Yes and pointed out the prisoner as the man that offered them—the prisoner said he found them opposite Bishopsgate Church and not knowing what they were he came to George the barman to ask what they were as he could not read or write—it had been wet that morning but at that time it was very clean and dry JAMES EVES police-sergeant H 14 On 25th Oct I met Taylor in Shoreditch with the prisoner in custody—Ritches was walking behind and handed me three notes—I took them to the Bauk and delivered them to Mr Higman—Mr Pearson a clerk at the Bank afterwards returned them to me stamped—I kept them in my possession till I took them to the police-court—they were then taken possession of by Mr Freeman—I asked the prisoner his address—he gave it Thomas Hunt at Mr Dixon s across the ruins Crabtree-row Hackney-road —I asked him where he got the notes—he said he found them opposite Bishopsgate Church and a man who had the appearance of a Jew saw him pick them up and wanted them—he did not let the man have them but they went to the White Horse and had a pint of beer WILLIAM HIGMAN I am a clerk in the Bank of England On 25th Oct I received three 5l -notes from Eves—I gave them to Mr Savage the inspector

am inspector of notes at the Bank of England I have seen and examined these notes they are forgeries they are not all from the same plate—there is no water-mark—there is an attempt to give it by

residence of a person named Dixon 9 Greengate-gardens Hackney-road it is opposite Crabtree-row Hackney-road across the ruins—I never saw the prisoner there—I know a person named George Hunt I subpoened him as a witness—he was here this morning I missed him about three minutes after I saw him here—I have since been after him to his house and to every house in the neighbourhood and have not been able to find him COURT to JOHN RITCHES Q Did the prisoner at any time tell you he could not read or write and want you to explain the notes to him A No he did not apply to me for any information on that subject—he said nothing about having found them until I asked him The prisoner s statement before the Magistrate teas read by consent as follows — I am a weaver by trade sir I have not followed it up for eight years come Christmas it was so bad I could not get a living by it I am a labouring man sir and now work on the Quay in Thames-street by the water-side Coming home from my

t18490611-1316  1316 GEORGE RICHARDSON feloniously forging and uttering a promissory-note for 100l with intent to defraud William Dimes and others MR BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution THOMAS THIMELEBY I am a solicitor of Spilsby in Lincolnshire I had a client named William Whittaker and another named George Searby—on 21st April 1846 1 had some deeds at my office belonging to Mr Whittaker—they had been examined and deposited there on the 20th—there was a note and a memorandum with them—I served a copy of this notice on the prisoner in Newgate the day before yesterday— this was a notice to produce the papers in question —on 2d June 1847 I gave up to Searby two papers relative to a mortgage for 79l which I believe had been in the same box with Mr Whittaker s papers—in consequence of something Mr Whittaker said I looked for his papers about 2d May and found the deeds note and memorandum were gone—I went up to London with him about 17th or 18th May went to the Tontine Insurance-office and this note and memorandum were produced to me by Mr Dimes—I believe he is the solicitor and managing director there—on 21st May I went down to Liverpool and found the prjsoner at 1 Sun-street—I asked what he intended to do about his life insurance with the Tontine Company Pall-mall and his note to the same company for 30l and likewise Whittaker s deeds and the note and memorandum of deposit for 100l which Whittaker owed him—he said he did not know what to do at present that he had no money having been a long time out of a situation but that he intended to pay something weekly to the company—I told him he was suspected of forging and gave him in charge of the officer who accompanied me—he voluntarily said Searby gave me the deeds in consequence of my having joined him and a Mrs Thomas in a note for 30l and upwards to get Searby out of Whitecross-street prison —he gave no account of Whittaker s promissory-note or of the memorandum of deposit—this note produced is the one I alluded to—I did not produce it to him—I had seen it at the Tontine-office Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Did he not say Searby gave the deeds and papers to me or gave what you have been talking about to me A He only mentioned deeds to the best of my recollection I should not like to pledge my oath to it—he alluded to the deeds and forged document—Searby has been a client of mine for many years—when the deeds and note were deposited with me I lived at Toynton about four miles from Bolingbroke where Searby lived—Toynton is near Spilsby—became to my office frequently—the box was kept on the floor of my office—I do not swear that the deeds in question were in it—these are Mr Whittaker s papers produced —here are two abstracts and a title—I believe I only gave Searby one deed—I generally put papers which I have not delivered over into a private box until I deliver them to Mr Spence my father-in-law—I hire been a solicitor ten years—I am not likely to give a person what they are not entitled to—I possibly handed Searby one deed two abstracts and some loose papers constituting Whittaker s title—all Searby was entitled to was a single deed—Searby knew Whittaker very well—I cannot say whether he knew his writing—he never communicated to me that I had handed him these deeds accidentally—if they had come into my hands accidentally I presume I should be anxious to return them to the right party—I have never had to refer to them since the day of their date and do not know whether they were there or not—I next saw them at the Tontine office—I charged Searby with stealing the whole of the papers—I did not know the prisoner until he was given in charge MR BALLANTINE Q Was Searby taken into custody A No after hearing his explanation I withdrew the charge—he said if I persisted I must take the consequences—I suppose he meant an action—he was never in my office after I gave him up his deeds GEORGE SEARBY I live at Sandwich-terrace Battersea In June 1847 I settled some accounts with Mr Thimbleby and received from him a mortgage-deed of my own within which was a deed a promissory-note and a memorandum belonging to Mr Whittaker—these are them produced —I got to London in the latter end of June—I recognized to whom the papers belonged a day or two before I came up—I went up expressly to meet the prisoner in answer to an advertisement for a partner—we entered into business together as perfumers at 22 Wellington-street Kingsland-road—the deeds were in my portmanteau at my house 4 Great Cambridge-street Hackney—in Aug 1847 I was taken to Whitecross-street prison—I got out the same month and took all Mr Whittaker s papers to Wellington-street wrapped them up directed them to Mr Thimbleby and put them into a closet—in Sept I went out for the day—I returned and found the greater part of the things removed these papers also—I saw the prisoner a day or two after at the place of business and accused him of taking away the partnership things and also the deeds—I had never told him I had the deeds—I think he denied taking them or having them—it is not true that I handed them over to him as security for his joining in a promissory-note or any of them—I remember the prisoner lodging at 13 Brunswick-square Hackney-road—a person named Tooke was his landlord Cross-examined Q You were in the habit of going to Mr Thimbleby a office A Yes—I am not sure whether I went after I got the papers—I saw him afterwards—I knew they were not mine—I had no reason for not giving them to him—it was in the hurry of packing up in fact—I was not aware they were worth anything at least I was not aware they could be appropriated by any one but the owner—I have got my own deed now—I have never made use of it—I put it and the other papers into my portmanteau and do not know that I looked into it but once afterwards—Mr Thimbleby said I stole these deeds—I gave my explanation as I have to-day—I took them from my house to Wellington-street to send them back—one reason why I did not do so was that I was very scarce of money—I am not aware that I had any creditors at Bolingbroke—I had several debtors—I lived there about ten years—there might be some that I owed a few shillings to—several owed pounds to me—another reason for my removing the papers from my house was that finding two years taxes were owing on the house I determined to leave it and gave the landlord the fixtures for the month I had been there—I moved everything to Wellington-street—I saw the parcel there almost every day—the cupboard was kept locked when I was not there—I was to give the prisoner 50l to go into partnership with him—I was arrested for 40l a month after I came to London at the suit of Wilkinson—it was a debt which I had incurred for business purposes at Bolingbroke—he lived in London—I paid off 16l of it after I came to London—I think I sent the prisoner word that I was in Whitecross-street two days after I went there—he came to me there two or three times perhaps more—I am not sore whether I or Mrs Thomas asked him to become security with her to get me out—I do not think he refused—I had then paid him 39l of the 50l —Mrs Thomas is a cousin of my wife s—she lives at Spilsby—she lived in London then and came to the gaol sometimes with my wife—the prisoner did not refuse to become my security unless I gave him security—I gave him 3l —I had my trunk and papers there—I did not give him the deeds and note as security or offer him them for any purpose—I am now a roaster plumber painter and glazier—I was apprenticed to that business—I had no creditors in London but the prisoner—I think I have creditors still—I am not sure—I was a plumber glazier and coach-painter at Bolingbroke and had some land which I occupied MR BALLANTINE Q When you settled with Mr Thimbleby did you bow what papers he had of yours A I know he had others besides the one he gave me and I believe them to be in his possession now—I have paid the prisoner 49l out of the 50l and gave him 3l besides to be my security—this promissory-note produced for 30l 18s is the one in which Mr Thomas joined—the whole of it has been paid by myself and her—I paid about 12l and she some and my wife s uncle the rest—the prisoner paid none of it—I know of no money having been obtained from the Tontine—I never saw this note and memorandum till they were produced at the police-court—I believe them to be the prisoner s writing some parts especially—I do not know Mr Whittaker s writing WILLIAM DIMES I am a solictor and Managing Director of the Tontine Life Insurance Company 20 Pall Mall About Oct or Nov 1847 a person who I believe to be the prisoner came—I had been in previous communication with him and advanced him 30l on account of the Company-be gave me his own note for 30l and these papers as a collateral security the promissory-note was for 100l with lawful interest to be paid in two instalments of 50l each with a memorandum admitting the deposit of the deeds at security signed William Whittaker—witness John Tooke WILLIAM WHITTAKER I live at West Keal Lincolnshire I deposited some papers with Mr Thimbleby amongst them was a promissory-note and memorandum signed by me connected with some business I had with Mr Spence—this note and memorandum are not my writing—the name of Whittaker is a forgery—I know Old Bolingbroke well—there is no person of my name there—I never had any dealings with the prisoner Cross-examined Q Is that signature like your writing A Something—I have known Searby by living about a mile from him—he never made any communication to me that he had got my deeds RICHARD MATTHEWS I am a manufacturing perfumer and was in partnership with the prisoner—I know his writing—this memorandum and note have not the appearance of being his HENRY MURPHY I am one of the Liverpool police—I took the prisoner and told him the charge—he said he did not understand about the note for 100l —I asked if he got all the papers from Searby which he left at the Tontine—he said Yes —I asked if that was the same 100l-note which he got from Searby—he said it was—I said How comes it to be drawn by Whittaker in favour of George Richardson —he said I can t account for that Cross-examined Q You found him at Liverpool in the service of Messrs Vey the large tea-dealers A Yes—I learnt from them he had been there eight or ten months—I found him at 1 Sun-street LOUISA TOOKE My father John Tooke lived at 13 Brunswick-square Hackney-road—he died in May—I cannot tell whether this is his writing—the prisoner lodged there Cross-examined Q For how long A More than twelve months—I never heard anything against his character GUILTY of Uttering Aged 32 — Transported for Ten Years

clerk to George Leese a shipbroker of Crutched—friars On 16th April between twelve and one in the day the prisoner came—I had never seen him before—he said I am Captain Brandt of the Russia that she was a bran new vessel belonging to Russia that he had left her a short distance below Gravesend that he had on previous occasions employed Messrs Sach Bremer and Co also Messrs Capperdike and Schleudau but was dissatisfied with the manner in which they transacted his business and therefore this time intended to employ Mr Leese as his broker and that he was not anxious to report his vessel that day indeed he could I not as he had not got the certificate with him that his object in leaving the ship below Gravesend was that he would first come to London and place his papers in our hands

cargo—he said perhaps there might be letters for him at Messrs Sach Bremer and Co s and in my presence wrote an order requesting them to deliver to the bearer any letters they might have for him—I sent one of our young men with it and he brought back two letters which the prisoner read and put into his pocket—he asked whether we could recommend him to a respectable man to copper his vessel—we told him we could—he requested our advice as to which dock he should put her into on her coming up which he expected would be the day following—the West India and Commercial Docks were named but nothing was set—tied—he expressed his intention to start for Bristol as soon as possible to see the lady and asked when the next train would go—we sent for Bradshaw s Guide and found it would be two o clock—he then said J want a little money —I asked how much he would require—he said 25l —we are in the habit of making advances to captains—I gave him twenty-five sovereigns the bills of lading and manifest remaining with me I should not have thought of parting with them—I wrote this receipt and he signed it and told me to debit his account with the Bradsbaw s Guide —he shook hands with me and said God bless you —I never saw him again till he was in custody about the 15th or 16th of May—I have searched the official list at the Custom House and find no such vessel as the Russia was at Gravesend during the whole of April Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Have you made inquiries at Graves end A No—I know Sach Bremer and Co perfectly well—there was nothing in his leaving them and coming to us—captains are very changeable JACOB WENDT I translated these two bills of lading and the ship s manifest—they are correct HENRY LENSKO I am living at Poplar and am a merchant of Memel and countryman of the prisoner s his name is Peter Henry Schceffler—I have received letters from him—this C Brandt to this bill of lading for the wheat is his writing and so is this Cruzinski to the endorsement—this name Moxila to this foreign bill of Exchange for 400 golden dollars looking it is his but it is a little imitated and this endorsement of Schmidt also—they are all in German—this acceptance is his writing but it is a little imitated part is his genuine writing I believe the whole to be written by him—there was such a house as Cruzinski and Co in the year 1828 but not now—the endorsement and acceptance of Van Bye and Co to this other bill is also his—it is a little imitated because he would not make them the same Cross-examined Q Did you ever see him write A Yes ten times or so when he has given me receipts for money he has had from me—it is about six years since I saw any of his writing—I do not know such a firm a Bruzinski —I am a merchant and English Consul—I have been away two years and left my wife and family—I did not run away through debt nor mean to do it or I could not have my passport—I have been back to Liebell which is close to Memel—I did not go there my wife and children came to me—I came here on business and have been in Dalston hospital nearly three months—I was not a bankrupt—I paid 50 per cent —I owe the prisoner nothing THEODORE SCHLUTON I am a shipbroker and know the prisoner his name is Peter Henry Schceffler I have not seen him write but have had letters from him—I believe this manifest the bill of lading and the endorsement to be his writing—I believe this bill of exchange for 400 dollars is his writing imitated—I know the writing of the firm purporting to be the acceptors—it a forgery—it is signed Moila it does not look like theirs—this acceptance Van Bye and Co is not theirs but an imitation—I have corresponded with them and know them personally Cross-examined Q Have you had conversation with the prisoner on this subject of any of the letters from him A Yes CHARLES PLAXTON I am a member of the house of Philipstall Plaxton and Co of Kingston-upon-Hull shipbrokers On 14th March the prisoner came and said I am Captain Schmidt of the Frien lying in the Waynfleet roads that is on the coast of Lincoln bound from Windeau to Liverpool and have been obliged to put in in consequence of the loss of my anchor and cable and have come down to Hull to try to raise 60l to refit myself to enable to proceed on my voyage that he had written to Messrs Barr Berens and Co of Liverpool for 60l but his vessel was lying in a dangerous situation and he would feel obliged if we would discount him a bill for 400 golden dollars which had been paid to him by the Elsinore house by whom it had been endorsed—it was endorsed to Captain Schmidt—he said the drawer was a rich merchant at Bremen and the acceptors were a banking-house at Amsterdam—I gave him 65l 7s and he endorsed this bill to me in my presence—63l 9s 3d is the full value—he gave me a memorandum for the balance—he said he expected a letter from Mr Bairnbairn of Liverpool remitting him 60l and authorised us to open it in his absence—it came and we opened it and found we could not get the money—the bill was protested and I noted—I wrote to the supposed drawer Moella and Co and the letter was returned through the dead letter office JOHN NORTHEN I keep a coffee and chop-house in Clifford s Inn passage In April the prisoner came and said he had been there before—I did not recollect him—he remained about four days contracted a small debt which he paid and left me to go to Hoi beach in Lincolnshire—he came again in May and handed me a bill for 1 000 silver roubles and asked if I could get it cashed—I said I would try but heard something about him and gave information—I have seen him write and believe the bill to be his writing and the manifest also—I saw him write the endorsement Asqueth on this bill ADOLPHUS LINDGREEN Jun I am a merchant of Crown-court Old Broad-street Wohrman and Son of Riga are correspondents of mine—the acceptance to this bill for 1 000 silver roubles is not theirs—there is a person named Lampier in that firm but his name does not appear Cross-examined Q Why is that A He was formerly a clerk in the house WILLIAM CURTIS I am a spirit-merchant of Holbeach Lincolnshire In April last I let the prisoner some lodgings io the name of Captain Asqueth—never knew him by the name of Schceffer Schmidt or Brandt—after some time he made proposals to my daughter—she was to have been married to him on the 25th of May—I never lived at Bristol Cross-examined Q Is Waynfleet near you A About thirty miles off GUILTY Aged 31 — Transported for Ten Years

Prosecution ALFRED HUTCHINSON DYMOND I am the son of Henry Dymond a dealer in articles made of gutta-percha at 2 Regent-street City-road About the 8th of Dec Colverd came to our office and stated his intention of opening business in our line—he stated that he was employed at that time by the prisoner Brown—I asked him the amount of goods he would require—he said about 40l would be sufficient—he gave his name and address as Joseph Johnson No 30 Cross-street Islington —he spoke about credit and I inquired his reference—he said his employer Mr Hall would be happy to give him a reference he believed but he would first ask him—he said his wife expected property in about two months and he should then have plenty of money to pay—I said our practice was to require a bill or bills indorsed by some respectable person as security if we gave credit—he gave me a card which I have not been able to find—it was a common business card—the name on it was Benjamin Hall Oil and Colourman or Fish-sauce Warehouse Felix-place or Cottages Liverpool-road Islington —an appointment was made to call on Hall for Colverd s character—that appointment was kept by my father who is not here—when the bills were to be accepted and indorsed I called on Colverd—we had supplied the goods and then my father drew these two bills in my presence—they are dated the 14th of December 1848 at two months—that was for the goods we had supplied—I went to Colverd s with the bills for acceptance—I then went with him to the house of the prisoner Brown and he was introduced to me by Colverd as Mr Hall—he said This is Mr Hill —this was at No 2 Felix-place Liverpool-road Islington—I introduced tie two bills and they were accepted by Johnson at Brown s—these are them—they are accepted Joseph Johnson —the word Accepted I wrote at his request and he wrote his name to them—Brown then indorsed both the bills in the name of Benjamin Hall No 2 Felix-place Liverpool-road Islington -one is for 21l 7s the other is for 22l 8s —after Johnson had accepted and Brown had indorsed them both Brown said Although Mr Johnson is present 1 will say that I feel much pleasure in doing him this service I believe him to be an honest and respectable young man —he also stated that we might I trust him to any amount—the bills were presented and were returned dishonoured and noted—between 14th Dec and 4th Jan we supplied many other goods to the amount of 157l —we have never received payment for them—about 12th Jan I went to Colverd s in Cross-street—I said that he being a young man and a beginner we should be glad to see a little money from him—that was on Tuesday and he promised to let me have 20l 30l or 40l on the following Saturday or at the latest on Monday—he did not keep his promise and I went to his residence on the Tuesday and found he had left the place—I think the front door was open—I looked in but could discover no goods—I then went to Brown s residence in Liverpool-road—I found he was gone and the place was shut up—I then gave information to the police—I these goods were all regularly invoiced—I did not see the prisoners again till they were in custody Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q When he presented the card to you was it printed A It was if I remember right lithographed—it was Benjamin Hall Oil and Colourman and some other articles were mentioned which he sold No 2 Felix-place Islington —that was where went and he represented himself as Benjamin Hall FRANCIS JOHN CONNER I am shopman to the prosecutor I delivered the goods to Colverd s—the name of Johnson was over the shop-door HARRY ROBSON I live at No 6 William-street New North-road-about 10th Oct I resided at No 2 Felix-place Liverpool-road—I had the home and shop to let—the prisoners applied to me about it—they both came together—Brown ultimately took it he gave the name of Benjamin Hall —I think saw the two prisoners together three times before the shop was opened—I cannot say that I heard Brown address Colverd by the name of Johnson but he called him Mr Johnson to the in his presence—on 23d Dec went to the house I found the place shut up and they bad just bolted I away—there was nothing left—they never paid any rent EDWARD TOMBS I am a boot-maker of 121 High-street Islington—I know both the prisoners About Nov last Colverd came to me about taking house and shop at 30 Cross-street Islington—he gave the name of Joseph Johnson —I let it him and he commenced business as a dealer In gutta percha—he put the name of Johnson over the door—about the end of Jan I went and found the shop shut up—I have not received any rent—I saw Brown at my shop—he gave the name of Benjamin Hall Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you never get your rent or anything in lieu of rent A Yes some gutta percha to the amount of 13s 6d and some goods were left at my shop for inspection—I do not know the value of them I have them by me—there was 12l 10s rent due—they gave me no warning—I let the house to Johnson but Hall became security for the payment of the rent FRANCES BURGESS I live at Kingsland—I knew Colverd when he was apprentice to my son—we called him Edward Colverd but his name was Edward Joseph or

Hall A Never HENRY WILLIAM DUBOIS police-sergeant N 14 On 12th June I received information and went to 14 Newington-causeway I found Colverd in a shop—I said to him You are my prisoner —he said What for —I said For defrauding Mr Dymond of a quantity of goods —he said I don t know Mr Dymond —there was a female in the shop and she said Oh yes my dear it is the gutta percha —he then said Ob yes I know I will go with you —I took him to the station—he gave the name of Joseph Johnson —he then turned and said I suppose I had better give my right name —I said If you don t I shall for you —he then gave the name of Joseph Johnson Colverd —while I was in the shop Brown I came up from down-stairs and I directed another officer who was with me to I take him—he gave the name of William Hall Brown at the station and said that was his right name but at the shop I said when he came up That is Brown take him —he said My name is not Brown my name is George Clark —I said I know you your name is Brown

conducted the Prosecution RICHARD WENSLEY I am a licensed—victualler at 339 Strand On Saturday 1st Sept I received this check produced from the prisoner—I held an I 0 U of his and he told me to take the difference or as much as he might want till Monday—I asked him what he should want—he said 4l which I gave him—on Monday I paid the check to Mr Johns clerk to Smart and Buller solicitors Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Was the prisoner alone when he came A I do not know the I 0 U was to remain with me till the Monday and the check also—I gave him 4l till the Monday and my son gave him some more afterwards WILLIAM JOHNS I am clerk to Smart and Buller of Lincoln s-inn-fields solicitors I received a check from Mr Wensley—after that the prisoner called and asked me if a person of the name of Wensley had been there that morning—on my saving Yes he asked me if I had a check of his—I said Yes and he said If you will keep it a little while Mr Wensley will send you up the money for it —in consequence of that instead of paying it through the Bank in the regular way I went and presented it and it was not paid—I did not know the prisoner before MR WENSLEY re-examined I did not send the prisoner to ask Messrs Smart to keep back the check GEORGE MILLINGTON I am clerk to Smith Payne and Smith of Lombard-street I remember an application being made to me verbally on 21st April for a check-book in the name of R B Kitchen—I believe the prisoner may be the person who made the application but I cannot swear to him—he had a pass-book in his hand which I supposed was Mr Kitchen s but I cannot say whose it was—I told him we did not give check-books without an order—he said he was Mr Kitchen s son—I turned immediately to Mr Tessier another clerk and a neighbour of Mr Kitchen s and said Is that Mr Kitchen s son and he said Yes it is all right —the person who obtained this check-book produced No 9174 signed his name to our book before me—this is his signature W Kitchen Cross-examined Q You were satisfied all was right and so gave him the check-book A Yes I believed from what Tessier said that he was Kitchen s son—I cannot say it was the prisoner and I cannot say it was not—I think he may be the man he is like him he is about the same stature and he had a black beard under his chin which made me notice him particularly—I did not like the look of him GEORGE TESSIER I am clerk to Smith Payne and Smith I was present in April when a person applied for a check-book in Mr Kitchen s name—my attention was called to him—I have no doubt it was the prisoner—he had Mr Kitchen s pass-book in his hand—I saw the name distinctly—my attention was called to him as being a son of Mr Kitchen s a family I am acquainted with and he said he was his son—I supposed he was the son because he had the pass-book and said I believe it is all right —I know some of Mr Kitchen s sons but not all—I have no doubt the prisoner is the person—my attention was called to him in a particular manner—he had a check-book given to him—there are no persons of the name of Cotterell and Sons who keep any account with us or Bamfield Brothers—I know no firm of the name of Cotterell and Sons Cross-examined If you had been asked without seeing the prisoner to whom it was you gave the check-book would you not have said it had been given to Mr Kitchen s son A Certainly not I did not tell my brother clerk it was Mr Kitchen s son I said I believed it was all right—I connected together his being in possession of a customer s book and having represented himself as Mr Kitchen s son—I know two of Mr Kitchen s sons well—they are not like the prisoner there is a very slight resemblance if any at all—they do not wear any beard under the chin MR HUDDLESTON Q When was it that you first heard that the check was a forgery A About an hour afterwards—on the Monday after I saw Mr Kitchen and his four sons at Messrs Bush and Mullins s office—it was none of them who came for the cheek-book COURT Q What was there particular about the man who came A Nothing remarkable I knew Mr Kitchen s very particular habits and I took it for granted when a man had got his pass-book and applied for a check-book that it must be his son—he was about five feet six and a half sallow complexion whiskers and about twenty-seven or thirty years of age—I identified him in the cell when there was another with him—he was much taller about five feet ten or eleven and of a very different build altogether—I had described the person who got the check-book as being about five feet five and a half high ARTHUR PUGH I am clerk to Smith Payne and Co I was present on 2l 8th April when the check-book was applied for in the name of R B Kitchen and delivered to a person—I believe the prisoner is very similar to the man who applied for it—I should not like to swear to a person I only saw for a few moments—the check-book was given between eleven and half-past and about half-past twelve or one this check for 140l was presented—I cashed it and gave one 100l note dated oth Jan No 75672 and one 40l note 7th Feb 60535—the check is one of those from the book given out that morning Cross-examined Q I suppose you see a vast number of people at your counter A A great number of all complexions and sizes—I cannot say whether five feet six or seven is about an average height—I noticed that the man was less than myself COURT Q Have you any recollection of the person to whom you paid the check A No not particularly—Saturday morning is usually busy and I should not like to be positive about it—we were not busy when the book was given out—I was engaged in other business at the time in the next division to the party who gave the book out—I noticed the person who had the book in consequence of his announcing himself as Mr Kitchen s son—I cannot venture positively to swear he is the man—I do not recollect to whom I paid the check FREDERICK THOMAS CRUSO I am a clerk in the Issue Department of the Bank of England and produce the two notes from the Cancelled Department—I paid them on 21st April between one and two—they were presented together and paid in gold—the name of Goodwin 14 Kingsland-road is on the back of them COURT Q How came they to be so endorsed A We always require the name and address on a note—I am not aware that the person pat that address on them in my presence ROBERT BETRUM KITCHEN I am a dyer carrying on business at Bermondsey I keep an account at Smith Payne and Smith s—I did not on 21st April send anybody there for a check-book or authorise anybody to go—I went to the bank on that same day about half-past three o clock and on looking at my pass-book I missed from it a cancelled check—the signature to this check produced is not my writing—I did not authorise any one to sign it—on the following Monday I was at the office of Messrs Bush and Mullens with my four sons I have no more—Mr Tessier saw them—the prisoner was not among them Cross-examined Q Nor a bit like them is he A No—he is a stranger to me MR TESSIER re-examined No one in particular had charge of the pass-book any one that happens to be at the receive-counter—a gentleman named Richards was there on 21st April—he is now ill—persons generally give their pass-books to a clerk of the receive-counter—the person who got the check-book might have gone to the receive-counter and given back the pass-book JOSEPH HEDINGTON City policeman 20 I took the prisoner into custody on the morning of 5th Sept —I took him to the station searched him and found in his coat pocket these seven blank checks and four counterfoils produced —they are numbered 9179—I asked if his name was M Creeth—he said Yes —I asked if he had paid a check to Mr Wensley for 12l 7s 6d —he said he did—I said there was some mistake about it he must explain it—he said he had taken it from Messrs Cottereil and Son for a debt he believed they were solicitors but he did not know where they lived MICHAEL HAYDON City policeman 21 I was with Hedington when the prisoner was taken—I asked where he lived—he said 14 Bedford-street Strand —he afterwards said his right address was 4 New Exchange-court Strand and that the first address he gave me was wrong—he said he occupied the second-floor—I went there and found a pocket-book and among other things it contained this check producing it signed Banfield Brothers —the number is 9179—there is also a card with 103 Kingsland-road written on it in pencil and this counterfoil of a check MR MILLINGTON re-examined I have no doubt that all these checks came out of the book that were given to the person who came with Mr Kitchen s pass-book—we never have two check-books with the same number MR RICHARD MULLENS I have made inquiry as to the existence of a firm of J Cottereil and Son —I have not been able to ascertain the existence of such a firm anywhere—there is a Mr W H Cotterville a solicitor whose handwriting I know—this is not his nor anything like it— the check in question was signed J Cottereil and Son GUILTY of Uttering Aged 32 — Transported for Ten Years 
t18491029-1887  1887 JAMES EDWARD GREEN aliasJAMES WENTWORTH feloniously forging and uttering a promissory note for 60l with intent to defraud Henry Reynolds MR PRENDERGAST conducted the Prosecution HENRY REYNOLDS I am a surgeon of Cambridge-terrace On 7th or 8th Aug the prisoner applied to me to take a house of mine in Saville-row—they I asked him for what purpose he wanted it—he told me he was an engineer and wanted it for the purposes of his profession that he was surveyor to the Indian Rail-road and had just returned from Egypt where he had been two years and I should see his survey but he had lost it in its transit from Egypt to England that his father was Godfrey Wentworth of Woolley-park near Wakefield and as his father was so well known he expressed his great surprise that I did not know him that his name was Wentworth and in all probability I knew his relation Lady Augusta Wentworth who was my neighbour in Connaught-place that he was also engineer to the Northern County Coal Company No 10 Agar-street Strand and that he had just returned from Sunderland where he had been making surveys of their mines and if I inquired at any banker s in the City they would know his name well and I should be perfectly satisfied with him—I went into the City and made inquiry of a friend who was well acquainted with commercial persons—I heard that what he said about his father was correct that his father had failed in 1825 but the family was quite respectable—I let him my house—theyhe took possession of it on 15th Aug —he was to pay for fixtures and improvements 125l for which he gave me two promissory notes this is one of them—they read — London 10th Sept 1849 31 Saville-row One month after date I promise to pay Mr Henry Reynolds 60l for value received J Wentworth —I did not see him sign this note but I have seen him sign his name—I am sure this is his writing Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Will you swear he said his name was Wentworth and he was the son of Godfrey Wentworth A Yes—the fixtures were to be paid for on the day he took possession the 15th Aug but he made an excuse that he was short of money in consequence of having paid his sister s milliner s bill his sister having gone to Ireland with the Queen—he said he was a father to his sister—from that time till he gave me these notes I made many applications to him—I do not recollect that I asked him to give me these notes—I pressed him to give me some security—I will not swear that the first proposition respecting these notes did not come from me—from 15th Aug till 8th Sept he remained in possession of the house—I found afterwards from the Court Guide that Lady Augusta Wentworth was my neighbour in Con naught-place—I knew nothing about it before—after three weeks I sent there to inquire whether they knew such a person as the prisoner and the servant s reply was that they did not—the prisoner had resided in the house before I made these inquiries—I had inquired in the City of Mr Whitton of Crosby-square a gentleman connected with commercial affairs—I have never been on intimate terms with the prisoner I received him as a gentleman—I did not ask him to dinner but he has taken tea at my house two or three times—I think I did not give him any supper—he remained with me till two in the morning once—I introduced him to Mrs Reynolds—he spent more than one evening with me—I am a homoepathic practitioner—on those occasions that subject was introduced and that was what detained him so long—there was no discussion—I explained the science—I do not know that the conversation got so warm that I forgot altogether the subject on which the prisoner called upon me or that he was obliged to recall it to my recollection—at the first interview I had with him he complained of a sore throat—I gave him two globules two decilions of paregoric it cured him—he thanked me and I felt further encouragement to speak on my subject—I did not make any proposition to him about entering into my speculation—he was asked to attend a meeting of the Homoepathic Association of which I was not then a member—I do not recollect whether that was the only proposition I made to him—I do not know that I have entered into any other speculation—I once lent a man 1 000l —I have never drawn bills on tenants of mine or received bills from them—I may almost swear that I never received a promissory note from a tenant of mine—I will not swear that I have not—I do not know Mr Brandon—to the best of my knowledge I never did—no one of that name ever took a house of me—I swear I never solicited a former tenant to give me a bill of exchange—the prisoner entered into possession on the faith of the representation he made to me—he did not give me these two notes at my request—I objected to take them—I had requested him before to give me security because I had my doubts about him—Messrs Cubitts called on me to make inquiries about him that first raised my suspicions—I told them I had considered him a respectable man but it was true he had not paid me the 135l and on the following Saturday I urged him to give me the means of identifying his respectability or security for the 185l —he then offered me two bills—he referred me to Mr Vill to Jones Loyd and Glyn and Co —he said They will identify my name and discount the bills —I went to Mr Vill and he said he did not know him—I afterwards got the bills WILLIAM FRAZER I am a tailor and live in Bond-street I know the prisoner—I knew him in 1840 and for several years before that by the name of Green and up to within a very few months Cross-examined Q How long has he gone by the name of Wentworth A About 14th Aug —I might have known him by that name before—I have a memorandum here of July 4th—I believe I knew him by that name then—I cannot say that I did before MR PRENDERGAST Q How did you know him then A He called and said Mr Frazer you know how I am situated I am going to change my name —I said You will find that very awkward —he said No my friends are going to advance me a sum of money and that will do it —I knew he had been in gaol but I did not know that he had then just come out—directly after he got into this house he gave the name of Wentworth—he wrote his name and address about 11th Sept —that was of the house in Saville-row—he wrote it in a book or left a card Cross-examined Q Have you your address-book here A Yes—Ido not see any memorandum on 11th May—the first entry in his writing is on 5th July MR E I JONAS I have known the prisoner twice in custody here in the name of Green—the last occasion was in 1847—he went to the House of Correction in Coldbath-fields for two years—the first time he was in this gaol for twelve months GEORGE HOARE I am deputy-keeper of the house of Correction

ALDRED I am assistant to Samuel Botson Aldred a woolendraper of 4 Victoria-street Skinner-street On 29th Oct a man brought me this paper and card— read 6 1l 2 black doth best you can for lit or 11s 6d T Cook —Card read — T Cook tailor and breeches-maker New Cross near the gate —in consequence of which I supplied him with six and a half yards of black cloth which came to 3l 14s 9d —he then presented me with this check read Messrs Rodgers and Company Pay Thomas Cook or bearer 8l 14s signed Edward Howell —I gave him change for the check Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Do you know Cook A Yet he is a customer of ours THOMAS COOK I am a tailor of New Cross—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—he is a hosier and shirt-maker and I understand has been so a great many years—this order is not my writing—I did not authorise him or any one else to go to Mr Aldred s and get 3l 14s 9d worth of black cloth—the prisoner never worked on my establishment or supplied me with any goods—the card produced is one of mine—I gave the prisoner three or four of them in July and I believe this is one—I do not know Edward Howell—I never had such a check as this—no part of the order is my writing—I believe the body of the check is the prisoner s writing I have teen him write several times Cross-examined Q How many times A Five or six—the signature to the check is a disguised hand but it is like the prisoner s writing—there aro letters in the body just like his ordinary writing—the oo and the k in Cook are precisely like his—the whole of the order is his writing—I swear to them both—I can swear to some of the other letters but am more certain about those—I do not consider the order a disguised writing at all—I have been at the prisoner s counting-house in Size-lane eight ten or a dozen times—I will not swear I have not been there twenty times—I never used it as a place of business—I went there in consequence of a card he gave me about a rich partner he bad got and cash being advanced on all descriptions of property—I should never have been there if it had not been for the card—I think I did write one letter there I will not swear I did not write two—I did not write three or four—I never authorised the prisoner to purchase goods for me from Moses s or Bousfield s or Amos s or anywhere—I know a person named King by seeing him at the prisoner s counting-house five or six times—I never saw him but there—I never wrote a letter in his presence—I once gave the prisoner a bill to get discounted he kept it a great time and I was fearful I should never get it back—I never gave him but one—I have been in my place at New Cross five years—I went through the Insolvent Court five years ago—I have dealt with Mr Aldred about sixteen years—I have dealt with him since my insolvency— card read Burge Chislett and Company Commercial and General Agents 4 Skinners-place Size-lane Bucklers-bury—Cash immediately advanced on every description of property CHARLES EDMINSON I am a tailor and outfitter at 91 and 93 Grace-church-street I know the prisoner s writing—this order is his writing and the body of the check—I cannot swear positively as to the signature—it is similar in appearance it appears disguised Cross-examined Q How long is it since you saw him write A I think it may be fourteen or fifteen years I forget exactly to a year—we did not then part on very good terms—after I had discharged him he brought an action against me—I gave my attorney 100l to hand over to his attorney—I believe the order is his writing the whole of it is his style and character of writing—I was examined at the police-court as well as here after Cook—in consequence of seeing my friend Aldred s name in the newspaper I went to him and asked if I could render any assistance in the matter—he knew that I knew Chislett s writing MR CLARKSON Q Have you any interest in the result of this inquiry A No I have carried on business in Gracechurch-street above twenty years ROBERT FREDERICK PRIEST I am clerk to Messrs Rodgers and Co bankers 29 Clement s-lane—we have no account now at our house to the credit of Mr C M King—the check produced is one belonging to the house—this check-book produced is one of those which we deliver for the use of our customers—it bears a date by which I can tell by referring to a book I have here that it was given out on 25th Aug 1840 to C M King who was then a customer—the check produced has been taken from this check-book Cross-examined Q How long is it since Mr King was a customer of yours A Four five six or seven years—I think he died soon after the delivery of this check-book in 1840 HENRY WEBB City-policeman 258 I took the prisoner on 8th Nov and said I apprehend you for writing some forged orders and obtaining some cloth —he said I thought you wanted me for some boots —at the station he gave his address 11 George-street Mansion-hose—I told him I was going to search his lodgings and asked if he had a check-book in his house—he said No —he did not tell me in what part of the house he lived—I went to the house made inquiry of the landlady Mrs Webster and in consequence of that went to a bed-room on the second-floor in a drawer of a chest of drawers there I found a check-book—in my judgment this check came from that book—the book was produced in Court in the prisoner s presence—he said he knew nothing about it THOMAS TURNER I am relieving-officer of the London Union On 17th July the prisoner received relief from there—I have no independent recollection except by my book—I have a recollection that he has received relief from July to Sept —I cannot fix on the day of the month but I have a perfect recollection of his coming within the last four or five months and receiving relief Cross-examined Q Have you an independent recollection of his having a wife and family A Yes a wife and two or three children—I have not got the number of children down here only that he received three shillings a week and five loaves and afterwards he had a loan of five shillings and then ten shillings RICHARD WILLIAMS I am one of the principal warehousemen in the East and West India Docks In Nov 1847 the prisoner was employed there as a casual labourer and continued there until Aug 1848—I was not aware that he was a commission and general agent in Size-lane and advanced cash Cross-examined Q He was discharged from deficiency of work A Yes not from any misconduct—he had 2s 6d a day—he was introduced to me as having been a hosier COURT to THOMAS COOK Q How lately did you know him A Up to about a fortnight before he was taken he lived at 11 George-street—I have never been there—he gave me the card at the latter end of June or beginning of July GUILTY Aged 49 — Transported for Ten Years There were two other

t18500107-305  305 ALEXANDER WADDILOVE feloniously forging and uttering a promissory note for the payment of 5l with intent to defraud James Nixon and others JAMES NIXON I live at 10 Albany-street Regent s-park and am a partner in the University Loan Society which is held at 3 Gower-street North The prisoner called there some nine months ago and borrowed 5l —he came again about 10th or 12th April and wanted a further loan of 5l —he applied for a form for which he paid 2d and I told him to put down the name of the security and it would be enquired into—he then left the office taking the form with him—he called a third time and brought a man with him who he represented as John Bolton bis security for the loan—the 5l was then granted deducting five per cent interest and Bolton signed the note in the prisoner s presence—this is it produced —the prisoner signed it and handed it to me—the payments were not duly made and in consequence we endeavoured to summons Bolton who had put his name as security—the prisoner then said the real Bolton did not sign the note but he would endeavour to pay the money himself by instalments—he gave Bolton s address as 8 Church-row Camden-town—I endeavoured to find him—there was no such person living there Prisoner Q Do you mean to say I ever had the promissory note in my hand and presented it for the 5l A Decidedly there is your name to it—I went to Thames-street to make inquiry about Bolton about the 16th—I saw Mr Bolton s master Mr Palmer the answers I received were satisfactory Mr Palmer gave me Bolton s address as 18 Church-row Camden-town I went there found it satisfactory and the money was lent—I had not seen the real Mr Bolton before the note was signed—a woman answered the door at 18 Church-row who said Bolton had been gone away about a week—I stated before the Magistrate that the man was present when you signed the note—I can hardly say now what sort of a man he was it is so long ago but I should know him again—he was about fifty years old—I should say there is 10s or 12s paid off the second loan I am not certain except by the books—I witness the signature of the person that signs at the time the money is lent—when the real Mr Bolton was summoned you said it was not his signature and the summons was dismissed—you said it was only a misdemeanor and we could do nothing in it EDWARD LAWSON examined by the prisoner Q About 13th or 14th April do you remember my applying for a second loan I had borrowed one 5l on Miss M Namara s security and applied for a second loan and asked if there was any objection to a respectable lodger as security A I have no doubt if you applied to me in that way I forwarded your words to the committee—I called at Mr Bolton s and made inquiry no one was with me—I called on my return from Blackheath—I went to Thames-street and saw two persons who I supposed to be porters—they said that Mr Bolton was engaged there and I was satisfied—I did not get his private address there—you gave it me as 8 Church-row Camden-town—I went there and finding he did not reside at that house I came away without making any further inquiry—we felt satisfied with his holding a situation in Thames-street—you received the money on the Wednesday evening—I recollect your coming that evening with the person you stated to be Bolton—the gentlemen were all sitting round the room at the time—I do not remember Miss M Namara applying for a loan of 10l and afterwards becoming security for you for 5l —I know she was security for you for 5l —I was not aware that she had half of that loan—I never saw the real Mr Bolton I thought it was the Bolton of Thames-street that signed the note—it was to him we gave credit and not to any other Bolton JOHN BOLTON In April last I was employed in business in Thames-street and resided at 18 Church-row St Pancras-road This A Bolton to this promissory note is not my signature—I never authorised any person to put my name to it—I was never applied to to do so Prisoner Q Do you recollect about March last hearing from your sister-in-law Miss M Namara that I had borrowed 5l and she was security A No she never asked me to become security for 5l —last Nov twelvemonths you called on me in Thames-street and applied to me to accept or endorse a bill—I told you I knew nothing of the transaction I would make enquiry to know if you had been sent—I made inquiry of the party and they said they had never authorised you to call on me—I never saw the bill JOHN JAMES HOWSE I was a partner in this University Loan Society This promissory note was signed in my presence on 18th April by a person calling himself Bolton—he then handed it to the prisoner and he wrote his name on it WILLIAM SMITH policeman E 50 I apprehended the prisoner in Judd-street on 13th Dec —I told him he must consider himself my prisoner on a charge of forging a promissory-note for 5l —he said Very well it was close at home he wanted to go in doors—I said No I can t let you go in doors—he said Oh you need not be afraid of my running away I have consulted my solicitor on the subject and he says it is only a misdemeanor you should apprehend the party who committed the forgery Prisoner The policeman has in his possession my loan society book I have paid 1l 12s and 1l 13s to the society JAMES NIXON re-examined The society has received no money from the sham John Bolton—the prisoner has received three loans two of 5l and one of 7l 10s —he is talking about the instalments he paid on the other two loans not on this one Prisoner s Defence I sent up money at intervals thinking it would be put down in one of the books in March last I became acquainted with Mr Bolton s sister-in-law Miss M Namara she was security for me for 5l I gave her half of it and she agreed to pay 1s 0 1/2d a week with me she was in difficulties at that time and the brokers were in the house my wife went backwards and forwards to work there she asked my wife to ask me if I thought the society would lend 5l more if she got a security I said I thought they would and I got the form-paper filled up with Mr Bolton s name and address as I was informed by his sister-in-law he was accepted as security I knew nothing of him or his address till I had it from his sister consequently I understood that Mr Bolton of Thames-street or Church-row would be the person to sign the note on the Wednesday a man came to my house and asked if I had not made application for a loan for Miss M Na-mara I said I had done so and I believed Mr Bolton her brother-in-law was the party that was to be security he said My name is Bolton and if you will step to the office now I can sign the note I don t know whether my sister is to have half the money I said Yes and he went with me at half-past six and signed the note I went again at eight o clock and got the money I afterwards went to Mr Bolton respecting the endorsement of a bill for Miss M Namara and then I found it was not the Mr Bolton who signed the note I have no idea of the man who signed the note I was not aware that there was anything wrong or I should not have attempted to send to Thames-street for his security JOHN BOLTON re-examined It was last Nov twelvemonths that the prisoner applied to me to endorse the bill long before this loan—he knew me perfectly well by sight as well as he knew any member of his own family

like intent Other COUNTS for forging and uttering an acceptance to the said bill with a like intent and other COUNTS stating his intent to be to defraud Henry Laurence Forest MESSRS CLARKSON BODKIN and HUDDLESTON conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM CLARK I am clerk to Mr Justice Coleridge I produce an affidavit made by the prisoner—I swore him upon it—this is his signature—it was filed at the Judge s chambers upon an application to be bailed— This was dated 19th Dec 1849 and stated that the acceptance to the bill in question was given by Mr Clements to the prisoner in blank while he was a minor to be completed in August 1847 when he would be of age in liquidation of his the prisoner s demand against him for 1700l CHARLES MILLER I am an usher of this Court I swore the prisoner to this affidavit on Wednesday last he signed it in my presence— This was an affidavit made jointly by the prisoner and Mr Jones his attorney dated Jan 9 1850 applying for the postponement of the trial until to-day Friday to afford an opportunity of subpoenaing witnesses from Dublin to prove the acceptance in question to be in Mr Clement s handwriting which acceptance the affidavit stated was written by him in Dublin JOHN MARCUS CLEMENTS I am twenty-three years of age I was twenty-one on 27th July 1847 at that time and for some time before I was a lieutenant in the 13th regiment of Light Dragoons—I was entitled to landed property in Ireland on ray arrival at my majority—during my minority I had several money transactions with the prisoner who at that time I believe had a place of business in Dublin—I think I first commenced transactions with him in Dec 1846 or Jan 1847 but my impression is that it was in Jan 1847—he used to come to my rooms in barracks—he brought pictures musical-boxes and jewellery and lent money upon bills—when I was approaching my majority I made a communication on the subject of my affairs to Mr Pullman—I think that was in April 1847—it was also communicated to my guardians one of whom was Mr Murdock a partner in the banking-house of Bouverie and Co of London—after that communication I placed my affairs in the hands of Mr Pullman and my guardians—I gave Mr Pullman authority to arrange any claims that the prisoner had on me—I first consulted Mr Pullman I think towards the end of April and at the latter end of June I think it was the whole of these matters were placed in his hands—in consequence of information I received on 21st Nov last I went to the office of Messrs Davies Son and Campbell of Warwick-street London where this bill for 1 000l produced was shown to me—I had never seen it before—the acceptance is not my handwriting—it was not written with my authority or with my knowledge in any way—I never accepted a bill for 1000l in my life—I have never accepted any bill since I became of age—I never accepted a bill in blank Q Did you in the month of July 1847 make an arrangement with the prisoner the terms of which were that if he would abstain from legal proceedings against you in Dublin you would give him your blank acceptance on a stamp large enough to cover the sum of 1000l and he might fill it up as a bill of exchange for 1000l in the month of Aug when you would become of age A No I did not—no such arrangement or proposal was the subject of conversation between us on any occasion whatever—my affairs at that time were in the hands of Mr Pullman—I was not aware before Dec last that proceedings were being taken to recover this bill as against me—I knew before that the bill was in existence—I first learnt that in Aug at the time the assizes were held at Croydon—I learnt it from Mr Pullman—I authorised Mr Pullman to take such proceedings on that occasion as he might think advisable—I never tried to evade any process supposed to be issued against me for the recovery of this 1000l -bill Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q At what age did you enter the army A Seventeen I had 300l a year then besides my pay—my allowance was increased to 400l a year I cannot quite call to mind when I rather think for the last two years that I was in the army I had it but I cannot speak positively—I do not remember whether it was for two years or one year I should say it was not for three years my impression is it was for two—it was paid from the Court of Chancery through Messrs Bouverie and Co —I drew on Bouverie and Co for the amount of the allowance—I was first a cornet for about three years—my pay as a cornet was a little over 100l a year I cannot say exactly I think it was somewhere about 8s a day but I cannot say—the agents of the regiment in England were Messrs Cox and Co of Craig s-court—I first served in England—the regiment went to Ireland in 1845—I was four years in the army—Armit and Buroughs of Dublin were the Irish agents we drew our pay through them—my pay as a lieutenant was an increase of 1s a day upon the cornet s pay somewhere about 120l a year I think I cannot state positively—I never took the trouble to ascertain the amount of my pay per annum—I used to draw on the agents when my pay was out—the last year I was in the army my income amounted to a little over 500l —I purchased the cornetcy and the lieutenancy—840l was the price of the cornetcy and for the lieutenancy I think the difference I had to pay was 1200l but I will not be perfectly certain about that—the amount was paid by my friends the money did not pass through my hands—I had no declaration to sign as to the amount paid I do not remember signing any paper—the money was lodged and I was gazetted—I certainly signed no paper declaring that I had not paid more than the regulation price I was not asked to do it—I first communicated with Mr Pullman in April 1847—he did not I think immediately go over to my guardians—Mr Pullman was then in Dublin he is a barrister he did not come to Dublin to see me—he was there as the friend of Mr Denny a brother officer in the regiment—that was the way I made his acquaintance—I do not know that he was there to arrange Mr Denny s affairs—I met him as a private friend—I never heard that he was there to arrange Mr Denny affairs Mr Pullman did not tell me so—he was introduced to me by Mr Denny—to the best of my belief it was about the latter end of April that I communicated with Mr Pullman—I cannot tell how much money I owed at that time I did know then I cannot tell you now I should say 5000l would have covered it I cannot speak within 1000l I am certain 6000l would have covered my debts—I put that as the outside—I had not borrowed much money—I scarcely know what you call much—I did not get much money—it is difficult at this distance of time to say how much I got—we endeavoured to ascertain how much I had had when I put my affairs into the hands of Mr Pullman and my guardians we could not do it precisely—I should very much doubt if I had 1000l in cash my belief is I had not more—my debts consisted of about 3000l worth of bills and I certainly put down the remaining 3000l as the very outside of what my tradesmen s bills would come to that was for goods supplied my friends and I in conjunction got in every account we could from every person who claimed any debt against me—it is out of the other 3000l in bills that I say I had not more than 1000l in cash—I had four bill crediton when I came of age Mr Joel Mr Harris Mr Rubenstein and Mr Marcus—Harris is a person that follows the same trade as Mr Joel I believe he lends money and sells jewellery—I am not aware that he is a jeweller he goes about with cases of jewellery in his pocket to the officers rooms—he has rooms in Dublin—I have frequently seen him at the barracks—a Mr Waterhouse was a creditor of mine he is a jeweller—he has not lent me money—he has sold me jewellery—I am not aware that he has any acceptance of mine—he had a check which I gave him and which I paid—I do not remember ever giving him a bill—I will not at this distance of time upwards of two years swear it but it is my belief that I did not or a promissory note—I have owed him as much as 125l —my firm impression it that I neither gave him a bill or a promissory note—the lapse of time makes it just possible that it might escape my memory—I do not think it is very likely that I could have given him a promissory note for 113l 10s and have forgotten it it is barely possible I do not think I ever did I will not swear it—I believe I did not give it him in payment for articles of jewellery purchased from him on 26th May 1847 I will not swear it—I believe I gave him a check which was paid—Harris had bills of mine—I have no recollection when I gave them to him Q Can you tell me how you paid Harris A Harris got a verdict against me in a court of justice in Ireland—he has been paid the amount of the verdict which he got—my impression is that he was paid about 300l or something under 400l that is since I was of age—I heard that Harris had sued me on certain bills of exchange— MR CLARKSON objected to the witness stating what he had heard from other parties MR CHAMBERS contended that the conduct of the witness upon hearing what was communicated to him was legitimate evidence to enable the Jury to judge of his credit and accuracy and upon that ground the COURT allowed the inquiry to be pursued —I did not do anything on hearing that an action was brought against me—it was in the hands of my friends—I did not go to look at the bills I never saw them—I said that two of them were forgeries and so I say now—I have never seen those two—Mr Franks of Dublin was my guardian s attorney in that action—I was in Dublin at the time and heard the verdict was given against me—will you allow me to explain I said there were two bills that were forgeries—there were three that were forgeries—I cannot tell the amount of those bills—no doubt it was told me then—it was considerably more than 100l —I should guess it was somewhere about 400l —I mean the forged ones—the total amount was I think about 840l on which Harris brought the action—I was informed of the total amount upon which Harris sued me—I understood that he first of all made a demand of 1 100l and odd but I was told by my friends that he brought the action for about 840l —I have no doubt I was told at the time upon how many bills the action was brought—I cannot recollect but my impression is it was on about five bills—I was told how many of those bills appeared to be dated before my majority—there two dated after—how many were dated before I cannot precisely say—I was told at the time—I have now forgotten but my impression is about three—two out of those three were forged—I believe those two amounted to a little above 300l —I cannot swear as to the sum—I knew I was not liable on the bills accepted during my minority—I know that minority was the defence made as to a portion of those bills—there was of course the defence of forgery upon the other three—there was the double defence of forgery and minority to one—I do not know what has become of the two bills that were alleged to have been accepted after my majority—I have never had an opportunity of seeing those three bills that I stated were forgeries—I never endeavoured to see them—I endeavoured to get them impounded my friends did—I was not present by my friends I mean Mr Pullman Mr Murdock and Mr Markcomb my guardians Q You have stated to the best of your belief that you did not on 26th May 1847 give a promissory-note to Mr Waterhouse for 113l 10s to refresh your memory look at that handing a paper to the witness A Very well Sir I said to the best of my belief—this appears like my writing I believe it is—all I can say is that I suppose I did not give Mr Waterhouse a check—I know I gave him some money—it must have been this instead of a check—my impression was that I gave him a check—I suppose I owed Mr Waterhouse 113l 10s on 26th May 1847 or I should not have paid it him—I suppose this note is proof of it—I know that about that time I bought a diamond of him which I paid him for and I fancy I gave him a check but it was this note—this has been paid I suppose—I should say if I owed him 113l 10s my friends have paid it—my affairs have been so much in the hands of my friends—I will swear this that in the spring of that year I owed Mr Waterhouse 100l or it might have been 110l or 113l and I paid him—I fancy with a check it might have been this bill but I know the document I gave him was paid—I believe the money was lodged at Armit and Buroughs and it was paid when it became due—I do not say it was that document—I believe the paper I gave Mr Waterhouse was paid—I do not believe I owe him that sum now—this may have been the document I gave him—I will not undertake to swear that it was or was not— this paper was numbered 1 —I believe this to be my handwriting the whole of it—I do not mean the whole that is written on that paper—I mean the bill is my writing—of course these signatures and other notations upon it are not mine but three months after date I promise to pay all that is in my handwriting—the body of the paper is mine—I gave Mr Waterhouse the paper in his shop—whether it was a check or bill I cannot say—my belief is that this is the paper but I cannot swear it—I presume it is the paper it is about the sun—I will not swear whether I gave him a promissory-note or a check Q When did you actually sell your commission A I was gazetted out in Aug I think but when I do not quite know—Mr Gold purchased my commission—I believe the money was lodged at Cox and Greenwood s previous to my selling out—I have no means of knowing that myself—those things were so much in the hands of my friends most likely they lodged the money—I had nothing to do personally with Cox and Greenwood from the time the regiment went to Ireland—I drew one bill upon them—I did not know whether Mr Gold would lodge the money at my private banker s or at Cox s—I knew he would lodge it in London—I did not know where the money had been lodged to purchase my own lieutenancy I had nothing to do with it I never inquired—I wrote to my friends to lodge the money—I believe it was lodged at Cox and Greenwood s—I left Dublin on 14th July 1847—Mr Pullman came down to Kingstown and saw me off—I came straight to London and remained in London from 15th July till toward the middle or end of Aug —my impression is I then went to Windsor—I must have been there upwards of a month or five weeks—that was after I bad left the army—I staid with my guardian Mr Markcomb a canon of Windsor—after that I went into Yorkshire to visit an uncle—I think I was there six weeks—I then went to visit Mr Markcomb again at his rectory at Great Halkesley near Colchester and was between there and London until Dec —when I used to come to London I staid with Mr Pullman at Shore House Hackney—I went to Spain after that—I think I started for Spain towards the latter end of Dec —I came back I believe in Aug 1848 to London and in Sept I paid a visit to my estate in Ireland and came back again to England and was either at London or Great Halkesley—I was backwards and forwards between those places—I should say I was in London as much as a week together with Mr Pullman—I was at an hotel the first two or three days—I must have been in Ireland about ten days—I went straight through Dublin up to County Leitrim to my estates—the greater part of in fact I may say all the winter of 1848 I was going backwards and forwards between Mr Pullman s and Great Halkesley stopping a week ten days or a fortnight at either place—I was visiting between those places until the spring of 1849 when I staid with Mr Murdock my guardian some little time—I had a lodging near his house up to about May but I was going about chiefly between Mr Pullman s and Mr Markcomb s—I forgot to mention that I was in Ireland when Harris brought the action—that must have been in Nov 1848 and I went to visit a cousin of mine in the county of Cavan—I stayed there some time and came away about the middle of Jan 1849 I think and from then until May I was visiting between Mr Pullman and my guardian s—in May I took a lodging at 17 Pall Mall—that has been my lodging ever since—I visited Mr Pullman when I came to town up to May and communicated with him about my affairs—I know that they have remained unsettled up to the present day and I know why—I do not know of any other claims than Joel s being left unsettled in the spring of this year—my affairs remained unsettled up to the spring of 1849 because we could never get a proper account from Joel and others—Joel sent in accounts which I had the means of checking and I knew they were not correct—Mr Marcus s account is still unsettled—he holds one bill of mine for 100l —I am not aware that any tradesman s bill was left unpaid from that period—I know a person named Meyer of Kilkenny—I have no account of his—I do not know that I owe him anything—my friends managed it—I never saw Meyer—I know there was an arrangement with him—I do not owe him 200l —the circumstances were these Mr Meyer backed a bill for me my friends thought it was very wrong of him an old man to back a bill for me when I was a boy and consequently they decided that only so much of the bill was fairly owing and so much they paid—what amount Mr Meyer may have lost by the bill I do not know I have not troubled myself about it—I know the bill is settled—I believe Mr Waterhouse is paid—I paid the money for the check—I knew when I was in Dublin in 1848 that Harris s action was going on—I went over on purpose for the action—I was first informed that Harris had sued me on the bill when I came back from Spain in 1848 not before—all Mr Pullman s letters missed me except just that one which I luckily got and which bronght me back as quick as possible—if I had not received it I might very possibly not have come back then—I went over to Ireland first about my affairs and then about Harris s action—I owed a Mr Dillon some money—he became bankrupt—he was requested to send in his account and I have been to his attorney s—his bill is still owing—I should say there cannot be much else unsettled with the exception of Joel s of course Q You have mentioned that jewellery was furnished to you by some of the parties whose names you have mentioned who called at the barracks what did you do with that jewellery A Some of it I swapped away to the same persons some of it I have kept—I never remember selling a single article of jewellery—I have changed things away to other persons than those who have supplied them to me but I never remember receiving any money for articles of jewellery—I gave very little away if I did any—I remember giving a chain to a man but of very trifling amount—I believe Joel supplied that chain to me—I do not believe I gave any away supplied to me by Marcus or Waterhouse—I took some diamonds to Mr Waterhouse which he allowed a certain sum for in part liquidation of his bill—I had those diamonds from various persons—I have no doubt I had some from Harris—I do not know how many there were—I probably had some from Joel—there were also two rubies I had them from Captain Holden—when I got the diamonds from Harris and Joel they were in trinkets I took them out of the trinkets to dispose of to Waterhouse—I cannot tell how long after I got the diamonds from Joel I disposed of them to Waterhouse—I got them at various times—I cannot tell how long it was after I had got die last from Joel—I should not think it was the very day after—I could hardly have had time to take them out of the trinkets and sell them—I cannot tell whether it was the day after—I rather think Mr Waterhouse allowed me about 80l upon the diamonds sold to me by Joel—I cannot tell how long it was after I paid Harris s demands that I took them out of the trinkets and disposed of them to Waterhouse—I cannot tell whether I did so the very day after—I believe that Mr Waterhouse allowed me 80l upon the whole paper I took—I had them by me for some time out of their settings—goodness knows why I took them out—I can tell you partly why I had a pair of scales and I took them out to amuse myself by weighing them and partly to see how they looked out of the setting—I was not of age then—I do not know what became of the setting the gold part it was not sold certainly—I rather think it went to Captain Holden—I know he had a crucible in which he used to melt up gold and he had a little marble of gold—I think I handed it to him to melt but upon my word at this distance of time I cannot tell—I had the rubies from Captain Holden I rather think not in trinkets my impression is that he had them unset—I think he bought them in a ring at Storr and Mortimer s in London—I was not with him but he brought the ring home one day when we were together in London and showed it me—my impression is that it came from Storr and Mortimer s—I had a jewel-case pretty full—I have some of them now not in my own possession—I delivered them to my guardians or Mr Pullman—I never gave anything that I bought of Mr Joel to a female or Harris or any of those gentlemen—I gave her some that I bought of somebody else—I gave her about twenty pounds worth of jewellery as near as possible I should say that would cover it—that was in Ireland—I was not residing with her—I was residing in barracks—I visited her constantly for about two months—I made her very few presents—I gave her small sums of money—I should say not more than 2l a week—I cannot say for how long—something under six months I should say or under four Q Besides this did you game at all A I only played once when I was in Dublin—I went to Dublin at the end of the autumn of 1846 and was there till the next July—it was at some hotel the Brunswick I think down on the quays—I was only there once in my life—I played at hazard—I neither won nor lost—I played in London when first I went into the army—the last time I played was in Dublin—I have not played at all since I became of age—it was in the spring of 1847 that I played at Dublin—I have played at gambling-houses in London in 1845—I did not go into a gambling-house at all while I was in Ireland except a booth in the races where I lost 2s 6d —I have not been in gambling-houses in London since 1845—I cannot tell how many times I have been into gambling-houses not very often I played at hazard—it was at the time I was at the Army and Navy Club and generally speaking a party of us used to go down to one of these gambling-houses—I could not afford to play high I had not the money and I never gave bills—I was not in the habit of going to gambling-houses and playing hazard—I went a few times that was while I was a cornet Q Do you recollect about Sept 1849 meeting Mr Joel in Regent-street A No I do not I have not the the least recollection of it—I am very shortsighted—he may have passed me—I swear I did not meet him and have a conversation with him—I met him by the Opera Colonnade in the summer of 1849—it must have been in July I think—he came up to me as I was going home—he did not ask me for my address nor did I refuse to give it him—he asked me if I was stopping in London I said Yes —he asked me to settle his claims upon me—I told him I could not myself do it that I would have nothing to say to it personally but if he would go to Mr Pullman of 5 Essex-court Temple he would arrange it—he said Mr Pullman would not settle he only insulted him—I said I did not think that was probable from what I knew of Mr Pullman—I do not say there may not have been something more passed but that is my impression of the conversation—he did not ask me where I lived—he might have followed me if he liked—I was close at home—probably he did know where I lived—he was by himself as far as I saw—he came up to me by himself and I saw nobody near—I did not see him again to my certain knowledge till I saw him in custody at the police-court—I did not in 1846 represent that I was of age—I did not give a treat to the men on the occasion of my coming of age—that was attempted to be proved in Dublin—it was on the occasion of my getting the lieutenancy the year before I left the army JOHN PULLMAN I live at Shore-house Hackney and am a barrister In the year 1847 I was in Dublin—I was there introduced to Mr Clements in 1846 or the beginning of 1847—in 1847 I was requested by Mr Clements and his guardians to investigate his affairs—I had previously had some conversation with Mr Clements as to the state of his affairs—he called on me at my hotel and asked me to assist him—I declined doing so till he would permit me to mention the matter to his guardians—in consequence of that I had a communication with one of his guardians and subsequently with both—I afterwards went to Dublin for other purposes and at that time was requested to investigate his affairs and I did so as a friend at that time—I had authority from the guardians to pay the debts that were due—I afterwards communicated to Mr Joel the authority I had and the terms upon which I was to settle Mr Clements affairs—I think I saw Mr Joel at the latter end of July—I called on him in Dublin—I believe he was then residing in Dame-street—it was about 26th July—I requested him to let me have his account with Mr Clements—he promised to send it me—I told him I wished to show it to Mr Clements guardians—I introduced myself by telling him my name and telling him that I had called as I think I said at the request of the guardians of Mr Clements to ask him for his account in order that it might be settled and paid—I do not remember anything else—I afterwards received from Mr Joel this document produced —it is dated July 30th 1847—I was then in London and I believe it was sent to me by post—I have seen Mr Joel write—I believe this to be his writing—I acted upon it with him—I saw him afterwards upon it and referred to it— read— 55 Dame-street Dublin July 30th 1847 —Sir in accordance with your request I hand you annexed a list of the bills passed by A Clements Esq 13th Light Dragoons with me I am sir your obedient servant Lewis Joel May I beg as early a settlement as possible of those overdue —J Clements s acceptance bill overdue July 3rd 100l July 8th 100l July 14th 50l due Sept 1st 100l 4th 300s 13th 100l 20th 100l 29th 250l Oct 6th 500l Oct 12th 450l all payable at Sir E Burrows and Co Army Agents Dublin —I do not know whether I was in London when that letter came or whether I was at the Assizes at Bridgewater—at all events the letter was sent me by post—the prisoner called on me on 20th Aug at my chambers in Essex-court Temple—he requested to know whether that account was satisfactory or not—I said it was not inasmuch as the consideration for which the bills were given did not appear—it was merely an account of bills not such an account of the transaction as I had requested him to give—he then gave me a verbal account as he said of the transactions—he stated there was what he called a book account—I requested him to give me the account in writing and he promised to call with it on the Tuesday following—it was to be an account of the whole of the transactions between him and Mr Clements—on 25th Aug I received this letter from him by post I believe—I have no doubt it is in his writing—I saw him afterwards upon it—here is a memorandum I made at the time of receiving it— Received Aug 25th — letter read— Mr Lewis Joel presents his compliments to Mr Pullman and apologizes for his want of punctuality but business of some moment which caused his return to Dublin prevented him keeping his appointment with Mr Pullman Mr Joel returns to London on Wednesday evening and will meet Mr Pullman at any hour he may please to appoint on Thursday A line addressed to 49 Strand stating Mr Pullman s time on Thursday will meet with punctual attention 55 Dame-street Monday evening —I saw the prisoner on Thursday or Friday at my chambers—he brought with him this account produced —I looked over it in a very cursory manner and saw there was a bill credited to Mr Clements for 36l —I asked for information with reference to that—he gave me the information—I said Be good enough then to put it in writing and he made this note at the time giving the explanation which he had before given me verbally viz that that 36l bill was included in another bill of 10th May—I believe I only called his attention to that item—these observations that are written at the bottom of the account were not made then—there are some marginal notes the whole of which with the exception of two were written by Mr Clements—I laid it before him for information with reference to it and he made those remarks— read— J M Clements Esq

he had spoken of was not there and I requested to have that also so as to have the whole of the transactions between them—I told him I wished to have the whole of the transactions between them—I ultimately received this other account from him I believe that same evening but at all events a very short time after—I have a distinct recollection of meeting Mr Joel in a cab as I was leaving chambers with this—it is in the same handwriting as the others— read J M Clements Esq in account with L Joel Dublin —Debtor —June 29th demi-chain 12l guard chain 16l ruby and ring 22l diamond 21l gold

was the whole of the transactions between himself to and Mr Clements—I never had any other statement of an account of any transaction between Mr Clements and Joel—I saw him perhaps four or five times on the subject of the accounts between him and Mr Clements once in London and I also saw him once or twice in Dublin—on neither of those occasions was the bill the subject of this indictment ever mentioned to me or spoken of—the first time I ever heard of the existence of such a bill was just before the Midsummer assizes at Croydon last year—Mr Campbell called on me I went down to Croydon on a subpoena from Mr Campbell—I was there ready to be called as a witness—I did not see the bill—Mr Campbell said he had not seen it himself—I sent a letter to Mr Clements when I heard of the bill and he came up to me from Windsor—I had told Mr Joel in the course of conversation that the guardians would pay anything for which consideration was shown and six per cent interest and at one of the interviews Mr Joel said he would give up a very large number of bills for I believe somewhere about half their nominal value if I would settle with him—I said I would not be a party to any compromise that I had no instructions to compromise any matter that he should have the full amount of any consideration that was shown and six per cent interest—that was on one of the occasions at my chambers—that was without any question of minority at all—any bill he could show a consideration for—this produced is the 1000l bill—I have seen it before—I do not think the acceptance is in Mr Clements writing Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Will you allow me to ask your age A About forty-seven—I have been called to the bar five years—I was a student before that with an Equity draftsman—I was a student for about three years—previously to studying the law I carried on the business of a woollen manufacturer at Donniford near Taunton in Somersetshire—I carried that on from 1830 about four or five years—I was not unsuccessful in it—I paid my creditors in full—I gave up the business and took to the law—I was brought up as a manufacturer it was my father s business—he retired and I took it from him—my brother took to the business after I left it—I think I have lived at Shore House Hackney about five years—I was with Mr George Simpson of Lincoln s-inn the Equity draftsman and conveyancer—I practise both at the Common law and Equity bar but my attention is more directed to real property law—I attend the Equity and Common Law courts in my wig and gown—I was called to the bar in Hillary Term 1845—I was a good deal at Dublin in 1846—I do not know at what time I went—I never arranged the affairs of any other gentleman of the 13th Light Dragoons or for any other human being but this gentleman—I know Mr Denny he had consulted me or rather his relatives had with reference to his affairs—I was in Dublin with reference to a suit which had been for a long time pending in the Court of Chancery there and I was then watching it in the Master s office for Mr Denny s uncles—I could not of course practise as a barrister there but I was watching being interested in it for them as a barrister certainly—I had a power of attorney to act and was to be paid the fees of a barrister for watching this suit which was a very troublesome one in the Courts and in the Master s office in fact there were three suits there—I believe I went there for that purpose in 1845 a few months after I was called to the bar—the first time I was there on Mr Denny s affairs was in April 1845—I was there previously and on my way from Kerry to Dublin I received a letter from Mr Denny s relatives to meet them in Dublin which I did—I had gone to Kerry about the affairs of Mr Denny s uncles the Blennerhasetts—it was not at all mixed up with Mr Denny s affairs—I was first employed in their affairs and then about his—I am not aware that Mr Denny had any debts or that he had borrowed any money or that he was in any way involved—he was a ward of the Court of Chancery for a considerable time—there was very great difficulty with reference to the management of those affairs in Chancery and I was requested to investigate the matter in Dublin which I did—the uncles affairs were also in the Court of Chancery and I was watching for both—I was paid barrister s fees for that—one of those suits is wound up the other is not on account of the administrator of Mr Denny s father having died and his accounts not being rendered—I became acquainted with Mr Clements in the winter of 1846 or the beginning of 1847—I think he first mentioned his affairs to me at the latter end of May or the beginning of June—I was then in Dublin—I had often met him before—I communicated with other creditors as well as Joel with all who I believed to be creditors in Dublin—I called on them—Mr Clements first called on me and gave me a verbal account—he then gave me an account of his creditors in writing it was after that that I applied to Joel—I am not aware that he kept a shop—he was lodging in Dame-street in a room over a fruiterer s or greengrocer s shop—I called on him saw him and requested him to send in an account which he promised to do—I said nothing beyond that that must have been a day or two before I left Dublin—his letter followed me to London—I have no doubt I gave him my address either at my chambers or my house—I have lost the envelope of that letter—he showed me no bills when I called on him in Dublin—I do not recollect anything more passing than I have stated—I had seen Mr Clements guardians before that I saw Mr Murdock at his bank in the Haymarket—I had been to London and returned before I saw Joel—I do not remember when Mr Clements gave me names of his creditors—it was before I came to London to see his guardians for I came to London to tell his guardians what he had told me—that was the first time I had seen Mr Murdock—it was somewhere about 13th July—I immediately returned to Dublin again and I believe that same day called on all the creditors in Dublin who I knew to have any account not the same day I returned from London but the same day I saw Joel—I took no bills or accounts with me to the guardians I had not received any then I am quite certain of that—I returned to London again to go on the Western Circuit which I joined at Bridgewater and there or in town I received Joel s letter of 30th July—I was at Bridgewater a week or thereabouts—I believe I only found one account waiting for me on my return—that was Harris s dated from Dublin Aug 2nd—it was forwarded to me at Bridgewater I believe—I believe I saw Joel on the subject of his first account within a day or two after the Somerset election—that was at my chambers—there was no one present but him and me—I made a memorandum of what passed at that interview—this is it produced —I made it at the time—it is a correct memorandum of what passed with the exception of some letters here in blue ink which were added afterwards when I endeavoured to test his verbal statement with the account that was afterwards sent in—there is no date to the memorandum only Half-past six Tuesday evening address 49 Strand —that was the address Mr Joel gave—Mr Joel was sitting with me at the time I took this down—I told him he had better send in a written account—he told me exactly what is on this paper—the interview must have lasted some considerable time—I frequently went to Armit and Burroughs in Dublin after this interview with reference to Mr Clements affairs—I have shown this memorandum to Mr Clements—I called on Cox and Greenwood once—that was subsequent to Mr Clements having left the army—it was in Sept —it was merely to pay over the balance to Messrs Bouveries—I think I saw a gentleman named Howard the clerk who attended to the 13th regiment—I have seen accounts at Cox and Greenwood s with him—I requested to have their accounts which he forwarded to me—I have not ceased to have anything to do with his affairs yet—I believe Mr Murdock was the acting guardian—he will know more about Mr Clements pecuniary affairs than I—I know nothing about them—I have never had any pecuniary affairs with him in any way whatever—Mr Joel called on me with the second account I believe on the Thursday—I have no memorandum of that interview—I believe nothing occurred beyond my requesting him to make that note in the corner in explanation of the item of 36l —my impression is that the interview was very short—it was at my chambers—I told him that the account was not satisfactory and requested him to give me a further one—this is what he afterwards gave me which he called the book account—I think I first saw the bill in question in Nov at Mr Campbell s—he showed it me—I subsequently called at Mr Clements and he saw it—I did not afterwards show it to Mr Netherclift—I never saw it but in Mr Campbell s hands—I first saw it by myself and then with Mr Clements and Mr Humphreys—I have not seen Mr Netherclift here I do not know him—I do not know whether he was at the police-court—I never saw him in my life—I do not know that the bill has been shown to Mr Howard—I do not know the name of any of the clerks at Armit and Burroughs —I saw several clerks there on Mr Clements affairs—I am not aware that Mr Howard was in attendance at the police-court—I should not know him if I was to see him—I do not know how long I was looking at the acceptance before I formed my opinion upon it certainly not more than a few minutes—I believe it is not his writing—I am confident of it—I should say I first saw him write in 1847—he signed his deposition at the police-court—I was at both the examinations there—the prisoner was taken into custody at the Bankruptcy Court in my presence—I was there in my wig and gown—I did not point him out—I heard that he was coming up on that day—I attended as a barrister instructed by Mr Humphreys to watch the case in reference to the bankruptcy—I had a regular brief—I think Joel was taken into custody when he was in the box if I am not mistaken as the officer did not know it was positively him till he heard him give his name—the officer was Sergeant Moone from Vine-street—I was in attendance there perhaps an hour and a half before Joel was taken—I am not aware whether there was any one there who knew Joel except myself—I did not hear him give his name nor see him taken into custody—I was sitting at the counsel s box—I did not tell Mr Jones Joel s attorney that I was there engaged in the next case—I do not believe I ever spoke to Mr Jones in my life—if he said anything to me it was as a perfect stranger—I certainly have no recollection of seeing him but as to saying I was engaged in any other case I most distinctly deny—I did not as soon as Joel was taken into custody take off my wig and gown and follow to Marlborough-street—I waited a considerable time—I went to call on Mr Clements and we went to Marlborough-street together—he was at an hotel in Basinghall-street—we first went to my chambers—the only person that I am aware of who was then at Marlborough-street to look at this bill was Mr Clements Q Did you after the communication from Mr Campbell take any steps to apprehend Joel until he actually appeared at the Bankruptcy Court A Yes when the bill was as I understood about to be produced upon the trial at Croydon Mr Clements was down there and his solicitor instructed counsel to move that the bill should be impounded in order that a prosecution might be instituted—Messrs Wright and Kings ford of Essex-street were Mr Clements solicitors and their managing clerk was there and gave those instructions—I was concerned in the arrangement of Harris s matters with regard to Mr Clements bills—Harris has never been taken into custody except when he was bound over to keep the peace having threatened to do me some personal injury—I am not aware that he has ever been taken into custody for forgery—in the account produced there is a bill for 500l stated to have been drawn or accepted by Lieutenant Williams—I did not refuse to pay that in the first instance—Lieutenant Williams did not threaten to chastise me if it was not paid—the bill was dishonoured and Lieutenant Williams was threatened with an action—he told me so and showed me the letter from the attorney—the reason the bill was dishonoured as I believe was that there was a mistake with reference to the date—I saw this gentleman and said to him Inasmuch as you had 100l of this bill and no more as I understand if you will pay 104l namely the interest upon the 100l you had I will deposit the remainder with Annit and Buroughs —I paid in 396l and with reference to its not being there that was not the fault of Mr Clements but the 104l was lodged and the 500l was then made up—it was dishonoured in the first instance—there was no dispute about the consideration of it—there was a little delay about the amount being made up—it was not refused on the ground of any charge of forgery—it was paid in two or three days I believe— looking at the second account I made this erasure on the back either in July or Aug —I made a memorandum upon this which ought to have been made on another and then scratched it out—I have had a great many opportunities of seeing Mr Clements writing—that was after I was engaged in his affairs—I have no recollection of having seen any bill that is signed before he became of age with the exception of one which he drew in my presence for 160l —I have seen his handwriting on bills which purported to be drawn before he became of age but I had not until he became of age seen his handwriting upon any bills—there were two bills which purported to have been accepted after he became of age which I have seen—I did not see him write those—I do not think the acceptance to the bill in question is a disguised hand—I think it is very much like Mr Clements writing but I do not think he wrote it inasmuch as there are peculiarities about it which I have not seen before—the only peculiarity it with reference to the s and the t —they are not at all like anything that I have seen Mr Clements write—there is no stroke to the t and here is a flourish at the end of the s which I do not remember seeing in Mr Clements writing—here is a peculiarity also about the C in Clements still it is very much like his writing— looking at a paper marked Z this is very much like Mr Clements s writing but it is not written as that is—I think it is his writing—it is very much like it— looking at one marked Y I cannot tell as to this—I should say J M Clements is very like his but the word Lieu t is very unlike what I have seen of his—I should think it is not his—a portion is like and a portion is not Looking at another paper marked X I should say looking at this that it is very much like a copy of the signature on the 1000l -bill—I do not think it is his handwriting— this was the 1000l -bill in question but handed to the witness in an envelope a portion of which was cut out so as to render the signature only visible —the words Lieu t 13th Light Dragoons are very like his writing but really I should say it does not appear to be written with the same ink as T M Clements is or at the same time Looking at a paper marked W I think this is Mr Clements s writing—I see the words Lieu t 13th Light Dragoons here—I think that is his—I have seen the three bills that were in Harris s hands which were alleged to be forgeries—I saw them at Dublin—the last time I saw them was in Nov or Dec 1848 in Court at Dublin and I had seen them before that when they were brought into the Master s Office for inspection—they were produced by Mr Bloomfield Harris s solicitor upon a motion for their inspection—when I saw them in Court they were in the hands of Harris where they still remain I believe or in the hands of his attorney—that was the last I saw of them—I saw Harris in Court he was there when the verdict was returned—I have not spoken to him since—I saw him at the Bankruptcy Court here and once at the Imperial Hotel where I was staying—I have not seen him at all since Joel was taken into custody—the last time I saw him was perhaps two months ago—when I saw him at the Imperial he was in the coffee-room with some officer upon some bill-transaction—that was six or seven months or more after the trial—I had nothing to do with Mr Clements debts—I have paid every claim that I am aware of that has been sent in—if any party has a claim against him I will pay it now—we are quite ready to pay every farthing—the matter is not finally settled—I have not paid Joel a single farthing and he has never asked for a single farthing—I have endeavoured to ascertain what amount in actual cash and what amount in real value of jewellery he has furnished to Mr Clements—I have only made these inquiries from Mr Joel and Mr Clements—I have been to Armit and Buroughs to ask them for their account and I have got it—I have no idea who the clerk was who gave it me—my account with Mr Clements and his guardians is not yet settled—I am to be paid thus I was requested to make this investigation and I then stated that I was not an attorney and I could make no charge whatever—they said if I would go to investigate the affairs I should have the fees which a barrister was entitled to while I was away—I would make no terms whatever with Mr Clements in any way or have any transaction with him—I stated so distinctly—I have been paid something by the guardians but am not entirely settled with—everything was done from communication with the guardians MR HUDDLESTON Q Why has Mr Joel not been paid A I have not had an opportunity of seeing him since Oct 1847 nor have I heard from him—I have never yet been able to get the bills which he alleges should be paid brought before me and have had no opportunity of investigating it—I found that he was not entitled to anything like the amount he claimed—the action that was brought at Croydon was not tried—Mr Joel saw me there—Mr Clements told Mr Campbell in my presence not to part with the bill—I never heard of the bill before I had the intimation from Mr Campbell—the memorandum I have produced was taken by me in Joel s presence—he stated that certain bills were in the Carlow Bank and certain bills were in the hands of Mr Bevan I think of the Old Jewry—he did not say a word about a 1000l -bill—I had this memorandum in my hand at the police-court to refresh my memory and read from it—Mr Joel told me when he gave me the first account that that was all the transaction between him and Mr Clements with the exception of the 80l book debt and then when he gave in that he stated that that was the whole of the transaction— Looking at a paper marked E I believe this to be Mr Joel s handwriting—I believe the endorsement to the bill in question to be in his writing—I have no doubt of it—I have never seen him write except that memorandum in the corner of the account but this is the same writing as his letters to me upon which I have acted JOHN MARCUS CLEMENTS re-examined by MR CHAMBERS I have seen the account of certain bills of exchange which was given to Mr Pullman—he also showed me this second account detailing the consideration for the bills—I made some memorandums on that account they are there now—the account was given me on purpose that I might make any observations upon it—they are in black ink—the last debt in this account is May 10th 1847 32l cash —I will not swear I did not have that—I will not sweat I did not have 210l cash on 1st May—I will not swear to any of these bills—I know I had not this amount of cash but what I had exactly I cannot tell—I will not swear I did not have the three diamond studs or the emerald ring on 10th May—this account was brought down to me at Windsor in Sept I believe—I will not swear that I had not the emerald ring—it is rather difficult to be extremely accurate in matters of jewellery—I do not know that I did not have 32l in cash in respect to the bill of 4th May—I did not know at the time this account was brought to me what cash I had received and what I had not—I cannot tell whether I had 210l in cash in respect to the 300l bill—I have made every endeavour to find out and surely such a large sum of money would have been lodged at my banker s or something of that sort—personally I tell you I really cannot tell—my impression is that I had not so much money but I will not swear that I had not—Armit and Buroughs were my agents—I do not know whether one of their clerks is here I have not seen one—I will not swear I did not have 87l on April 29th in respect of a 100l bill—there is only one bill that I kept any account of and that was one for 500l —I cannot swear as to any of the others—I will not swear I did not have the 322l on 9th April in respect to a bill for 450l or a diamond pin and two rubies for 60l —the rubies must have been the two that I spoke of before—I believe I had that—I believe I gave him the two rubies to mount and he supplied the diamond—I cannot say whether that was the diamond I abstracted and disposed of to Mr Waterhouse I rather think not—I do not know what became of that diamond—Mr Waterhouse has got the rubise—I cannot tell whether that ring was melted up by Captain Holden—I cannot say whether I had a diamond ring at 200l on 26th March—there is no memorandum of mine against that item—I will not swear I did not have it—there is no objection made to a set of studs at 16l or a watch at 35l —I had a set of enameled diamond buttons and studs on 17th March but he charged them at 100l instead of 75l —I am sure I did not have the opals which are charged at 25l —my first transaction with Joel was on Nov 20th with regard to five pictures—I dare say I had the diamond ring for 40l —I have put no mark to that—here are the words Harris has these —that refers to the three diamond studs charged at 100l —I did not take them out of the setting and sell them to him I merely swapped them away—this credit for 40l returned refers to two studs which Harris charged me 80l for and for which Joel allowed me 40l —I can swear I did not have the opal studs I will not venture to swear with regard to any of the others—I have not put any objection to cash 335l on Feb 3rd —I made a note of that bill at the time or very soon after and the account here given does not in the least tally with my note of it—I will venture to swear this account of it is incorrect—this is the note I made of it produced —I cannot say whether I received any cash from Mr Joel in respect to that bill I will not swear I did not—I know this was the agreement on which the bill was drawn because there was always an agreement on all these bills as to what was to be in cash what in jewellery and what was to be the commission—I never drew a bill without that arrangement—I should say this memorandum was not made in Joel s presence—I have no means of knowing whether I personally received any cash on that bill—I know there was 100l cash paid on it which Lieutenant Williams had whether I received the remaining 150l I cannot tell—it may have been dishonoured at first but it was paid eventually—my affairs were then out of my own hands and I was away—I cannot swear whether I got the three stone diamond ring charged at 85l my impression is I did not if there is no memorandum of mine on the margin I suppose I did—I sold that diamond to Waterhouse—there is a note of it—I cannot say when I sold it him—I know the stones did go there eventually but when I cannot recollect—Lieutenant Williams did not come to me about the bill after it had been dishonoured—I was in England when it was due—I do not remember receiving any letter from him—I have never seen him since—he was aid-decamp to the Lord-Lieutenant and I believe he is so now—I know what accepting a bill in blank is—it is writing your name across a blank piece of paper—I never saw the two bills of Harriss that have been mentioned—I was not in the Court at Dublin—I was waiting at Morrison s Hotel while the trial was going on—Mr Franks of Dublin was my attorney—Joel used to come to me at barracks as you will see by his accounts every now and then—the bills were drawn and accepted in my private room there—no one was present when I gave any of the bills—of course you would not have two in your room at once—I think Joel came to me in June and July 1847—I cannot tell the date but it was after I had signed the last bill in this account—it may have been the beginning of July—he was a very short time with me it was in my barrack-room—he did not ask me to make any payment on account—he asked me to renew two bills—I do not recollect which they were but he said two bills would become due and he asked me to renew them—he did not show them to me—they may have been over due or coming due I do not recollect which—the conversation perhaps might have lasted five or six minutes—we were the only two persons present—I refused to renew the bills—I did not give him any reason I said I would rather not—he did not ask for a reason—he said he wished I would renew them and wished me to write a letter saying that all his transactions with me were fair and I declined doing either Q Did not he ask you why you refused to renew them and did not you say because you were a minor A No decidedly not because I was a minor then and it could have done him no good to renew those bills—I do not recollect anything passing about my being a minor—I will not swear it but my impression is there was nothing—he did not threaten to take proceedings against me he was very civil he said nothing of the sort—I do not recollect his saying I had disputed other persons accounts and said I was a minor—I do not recollect that I had disputed any accounts—I was not told as early as April when I consulted Mr Pullman that the defence of minority was a good one—I may possibly have had conversation between May and July 1847 with persons about my being a minor when I accepted bills and very possibly with creditors—I do not remember telling anybody that I was not bound by those acceptances because they were given when I was a minor—I do not recollect any such conversations—I say it is possible there may have been such conversations but I do not recollect it I do not deny that there were—I saw Harris when I had dealings with him at the barracks and accepted bills of exchange for him—I will swear I accepted no bills of exchange in blank for him—my impression is that I gave him five bills—I will not swear it was not more—I kept no account or memorandum of any bill but the one for 500l —when I became of age I had a very good idea of the general amount of bills against me and I could guess the number but I did not know it—Joel went away from that last visit without my agreeing to make any arrangement with him with regard to his claim against me—I went down to Croydon with Mr Pullman and I believe a clerk of Messrs Kingsford and Wright counsel I understand had instructions in Court to impound the bill if it was produced but it was not—I did not see Joel there—I did not go into Court—I was staying at Windsor when I first heard of the bill and I came off I think almost the next day—I passed through London—I may have gone to Kingsford and Wright s offices I cannot say—I know that there is an action now pending against me upon that very bill—I believe that had been begun long before Joel was taken into custody—I had heard of it before that—I came up to London from Yorkshire the moment I heard there was such an action and that the bill was likely to be forth-coming—I went to Mr Campbell s and that was the first time I saw it—I did not believe it was my signature decidedly not Q That being so were you called upon to write your name twice and did you write your name twice at Mr Campbell s A I did sign some things declaring it to be a forgery whether it was two or one I am sure I do not know—Mr Campbell did not call on me to give a specimen of my writing by writing my name—whether Mr Pullman asked me to do it or not I do not know it is so slight a thing to write one s name—I knew the bill was a forgery directly—I was certainly not asked by Mr Campbell to give a specimen of my writing—I do not remember being called on to write my name except signing those documents I then signed my Christian names at full length—I sometimes sign at full length and sometimes with my initials only—if I am signing a letter I generally put my initials if I was signing a power of attorney or a thing of that kind I should do it at full length—bills of exchange I used to sign with initials—it was usually Accepted Messrs So-and-so J M Clements Lieu t 13th Light Dragoons payable at Messrs Armit and Burroughs —I usually wrote accepted payable Saturday January 12th MR BODKIN Q In the observations you made yesterday upon one or two items in the second account did you confine yourself entirely to that of which you had an accurate recollection A Yes—I have never personally or through the medium of any other person denied that I have received considerable sums of money through the prisoner but I do deny that this account is correct—I have denied the amounts I am not now in a condition to say to what extent—this memorandum which I made with reference to Lieut Williams s bill does not enable me to say whether I had that 250l in cash—it enables me to swear that the statement of it here is wrong and to state the nature of the arrangement that I then made with Mr Joel—it was a bill for 500l with the additional security of Lieut Williams—Joel was to give me in cash 250l to take up two bills which he had given to Mesage the print-seller for 67l which he did not do to take out in goods 83l and interest at the rate of 60 per cent the bill was drawn for four months that would be 100l —in my other dealings with bills with Joel I always made a similar kind of bargain but I took no memorandum of any other bill because I was the only party liable but this bill was chiefly for Lieut Williams s benefit—Joel generally paid the money advanced on the bills into Armit and Burroughs—I have received small sums from him in barracks—I took his word for paying the cash into my bankers—I had no means of examining my account there before making my observations on this account at Windsor—we had the account I believe at Windsor—I cannot swear that I had seen it I do not think I saw it before I returned the account Q with respect to the jewellery about which you have been examined did you want the jewellery or was it part of the consideration given for the acceptances proposed by Mr Joel A In very nearly every case it was part of the bargain—sometimes I may have taken a fancy to a thing and taken it as a fancy thing but I did not want all this jewellery—I should think it was some of those articles which I did not want that I sold—since I was examined yesterday I have found Mr Waterhouse s account— upon MR BODKIN proposing to put this into the witness s hand to refresh his memory MR CHAMBERS objected MR JUSTICE TALFORD was of opinion that the witness could not be permitted to refresh his memory from a document in the handwriting of another person —I am now prepared to state that I gave Mr Waterhouse a check for 100l —his claim was satisfied to the extent of 100l —I was in Spain when I first heard of the action brought by Harris—that was by a letter which I received I think about July 1848—that brought me immediately to England—I went over to Dublin on the trial—I was first of all staying near Dublin with Lord Leitrim—I was in Dublin altogether perhaps three or four days or a week—I was staying at Morrison s Hotel there—I did not see Joel during my stay there—I believe Harris was an acquaintance of the prisoner s—I do not recollect having seen them together—Harris was in the habit of coming to the barracks the same as Joel—I was told the particulars of Harris s bills which I say were forged both by Mr Pullman and Mr Markcomb who were in Dublin with me—with respect to the first of the three I was told that Mr Gold s name was at the back of it as well as at the back of another which was a genuine bill—I knew he had only backed one bill for me and in Court he swore that the signature to the other was a forgery—I was told that—I was also told that the date of that same bill had been tampered with that the date had been scratched out and a fresh date put in—I was told what the date was but I do not remember it now—it was not a date after I became of age—I was told that the other two bills were signed and dated after I became of age—I concurred in the defence of minority and forgery made to Harris s action—I was then informed of the forgeries of those bills—no communication was made to me on the subject of this 1 000l bill while I was in Dublin or the neighbourhood—I went to Mr Campbell s office to see the bill—it was not intimated to me at the time I was asked to write my name that it was with a view of being compared with any other writing of mine—Mr Campbell requested me before he showed me the bill to sign my name to a document that it was a forgery—before he showed me the bill he said he should require me if it was a forgery to sign a declaration to that effect and said he would prosecute Mr Joel—neither Mr Campbell or anybody else suggested to me to write my name as I ordinarily wrote it on bills of exchange—the interview between myself and the prisoner at the barracks in July 1847 was not very long before I left Dublin I cannot remember exactly how long I should say it might have been a week before—that was the last interview I had with him on the subject of business with the exception of the short conversation at the Opera Colonnade—I have a sufficient recollection of what took place on that occasion to be able to state positively that nothing was written between us—he made no other proposal to me than to renew certain bills that were coming due and to give him a letter stating that all his transactions with me had been fair and just—that was all that passed—I am perfectly certain of that—I did not know at that time that he had been in communication with Mr Pullman—I cannot say whether Mr Pullman was then in Dublin but my impression is that he was—I know that he went to London about that time to see my friends—I saw him soon after this interview because I detailed it to him MR CHAMBERS Q Since last night have you been asked any questions or have you made any communication to any person with reference to what you said upon cross-examination A I have not—Mr Pullman handed me over Mr Waterhouse s account to look at but I had no conversation—I walked home part of the way with Mr Pullman and he expressly declined to enter into conversation with me on the subject—he said it was not right—he handed me the account in his chambers and said You had better look over Waterhouse s account and that was all he said—I have had no communication whatever as to the evidence—I have no recollection of having made a drawing of the diamond and ruby ring for the purpose of having some trinket made by Mr Joel—I will not deny having done so I do not remember it is very possible I might—I did not break it up and sell it the very next day my impression is that I did not but I cannot swear it COURT Q Had you yourself any notion of the value of rubies and diamonds and articles of that kind A No certainly not or I should not have given the price I was charged—I had purchased jewellery before I went to Dublin—not to any great extent—I had no idea of the value—I was about seventeen when I entered the army—I served not quite a year at Hounslow—I think I joined in Sept or Oct and marched away in the spring—I was not twenty when I went to Ireland—I was first in the south of Ireland for some time in Kilkenny and Limerick and then went to Dublin—I had connexions in Dublin but no very intimate friends—I am an Irishman—I have friends and connexions both in Ireland and England—my property when I became of age was all landed property—there were the savings of my minority—my father died when I was about eight years old and my mother when I was twelve—I was born in London—my father was an Irishman JOHN THOMAS CAMPBELL I am a solicitor This 1000l -bill has been in my possession—I produced it before the Magistrate—I brought an action on it against Mr Clements—the action was commenced in May and it is now pending—I commenced it a day or two after Mr Clements had called on me and pronounced it to be a forgery but I am not positive whether the writ was issued previously or not—I attended at Croydon in Aug 1849 where the action was to be tried—my firm brought the action—at that time we believed the bill was in Mr Joel s possession—we brought the action against Joel for Forrest—he was the manager of the London and Dublin Bank—we did not bring the action in his name as a public officer—I believe the bill was discounted by him in his own name—the action was brought to recover a large debt that bill being a portion of the amount—the London and Dublin Bank are our clients in the action against Mr Clements—Forrest is the plaintiff in that action—he has left the country emigrated as I understand he left a power of attorney before he left the country—I saw him about a week or two after the assizes at Croydon about the middle of Aug 1849 and never since—I do not think I have seen Joel since the action was commenced except before the Magistrate—I saw him on the subject of the action before I commenced it Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q What firm are you a member of A Davies Son and Campbell—I have been admitted as an attorney I think four or five years—Mr Davies has been in Warwick-street more than half a century—in the action at Croydon our firm acted for the London and Dublin Bank—the day was fixed for the trial I think before a special jury—I think about the day before it was coming on Mr Joel made a communication through his solicitors that he wished to arrange the action—an appointment was made and Mr Joel came to our office with his solicitor and I then told him that Mr Pullman had informed me that no such bill was in existence and if such a bill was in existence it was a forgery—I told that distinctly to Mr Joel and he consented to give us a judgment for the debt that was claimed—we told him we would listen to no terms unless he gave us a judgment and gave us back the bill he had got from Mr Forrest—this was on 13th Aug —I then went out of town and on 23rd Sept I saw the bill in our office—I think it was with some papers relating to the business—Mr Pullman was subpoenaed by our firm—it was our intention to call him as a witness if necessary in that action—Mr Pullman and Mr Clements called to inspect the bill—I think that was after I had written a letter relative to it—we made inquiries and afterwards went on with the action—Mr Clements wrote his name twice in my presence in Warwick-street Q Having seen him write his name did you look at the signature to the bill and have you formed any belief or judgment as to that being his handwriting A I have a very strong belief it is his handwriting it only goes to belief of course—I have seen a good many bills with his signature to them—that is a reason for my coming to that belief—my judgment upon seeing him write would not be so strong because he signed bis name in full and the signature to the bill is in short—I believe it to be his writing—I am now speaking as to the general result of my investigation—I could not have formed a belief if I had not seen those other bills—the action is now pending—it was stayed on the question of security for costs because Mr Forrest was out of the country and when Mr Clements brought forward this indictment we thought we might stay the action and see the result of this indictment—Mr Humphreys or Mr Pullman I am not certain which I think it was Mr Humphreys told me that a warrant was out against Joel—that was a very short time after Mr Clements and Mr Pullman had called to see the bill—I think I communicated with Mr Jones Joel s solicitor the day or day after I had that information—I think it was about a month after that that Joel appeared at the Bankruptcy Court—it might be a week after I cannot exactly recollect—I have no interest whatever nor has my firm in this matter beyond our acting as attorneys for the Dublin Bank MR CLARKSON Q Look at the writing on the back of the bill it appears to be wholly erased was that the state in which it was when you first saw it A Yes—I think I spoke either to Mr Pullman or Mr Murdock about Mr Clements s address—there was no hesitation on their part in acting upon it—Mr Humphreys agreed to accept process immediately—there appears to be the name of Forrest on the bill under the name of Lewis Joel next to it—it may not be Forrest it looks like Forrest—it was there when I saw it first—we have a clerk named Reeve he told me he had made a copy of the bill—I saw that copy the other day for the first time—I have not got it—I have no doubt Reeve has got it with him—when Mr Clements signed his name twice it was to a duplicate memorandum—before I showed him the bill I asked him if he would have any objection to state in writing after he had seen it whether it was his signature or not—he said Oh certainly not —I showed him the bill he said It is not my signature and I wrote out that memorandum which he signed—I did not get the signature from him for the purpose of a comparison of his writing—I have not got the duplicate memorandum with me this is one of those that Mr Clements signed produced —I think I was requested to give security for costs for Forrest the moment Mr Humphreys was enabled to apply for it—I think he applied for it as soon as he was entitled after the issuing of the writ—perhaps it was a fortnight or three weeks after—I cannot tell whether it was on 10th Dec looking at a paper handed to him it must have been on 10th Dec —we commenced the action on 23rd Nov just two days after Mr Clements had been to inspect the bill—it must have been at the end of Sept that we made inquiries after Mr Clements had stated it was a forgery before it came into our hands and therefore as soon as it came into our hands we made inquiry—I told Mr Jones Joel s solicitor that I was informed there was a warrant out against him—that must have been a day or two days after Mr Humphreys told me—it must have been two or three days but it was not more than that HENRY JAMES REEVE I am a clerk in the office of Messrs Davies Son and Campbell On 10th Sept I received a bill from Chignell—I believe this is the bill looking at it —I made a copy of it at the time—this is it handing it in —as far as my memory serves me this is an exact copy of the bill—I really do not remember whether the endorsements were scratched out at the time or not—I believe that is the bill—refreshing my memory with the copy I made at the time I cannot say positively whether the endorsements on the bill when I made the memorandum on it were visible or not but I think they were HENRY CHIGNELL I am messenger at the house and office of Messrs Davies Son and Campbell In the month of Aug or Sept I saw the prisoner in the office—he wanted to leave a memorandum or bill of exchange with me to give to one of the firm when they came—he did not tell me the amount—this looking at the bill may be it but I cannot swear whether it is or not—whatever he gave me I gave to Mr Reeves the clerk Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q How many hundred papers do you receive in a day from parties that call at the office A Not many hundreds I may have received a good many—I do not read the papers that are given me—I merely got a slip of paper without knowing what it contained and handed it over to one of the clerks—the prisoner gave me a paper or bill of exchange and I gave it to Mr Reeves—I cannot tell how many other papers I delivered on that day to Mr Reeves it might have been many or few MR CLARKSON Q Did you deliver over any other paper from Mr Joel to Mr Reeves except the memorandum or bill of exchange or paper you have referred to A Certainly not—I gave the prisoner a memorandum for it COURT Q Does your memory serve you to know what sort of paper it was whether it was a slip of paper in the form of this or whether it was a different sort of paper A It was a slip of paper in the form of this and I believe that is it but I really cannot swear—it was that sort of paper in length and breadth SAMUEL JARMAN I am one of the assistants of Mr Humphreys the attorney for this prosecution On Monday 7th Jan at Marylebone Police Court I served a notice on the prisoner of which this is a copy produced Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Do you know Mr Netherclift A Yes he is a lithographer—he has been taken to see this bill I think about ten days ago—I am not certain as to the date—no other persons that I am aware of have been taken to see it—I hare not been to Cox and Greenwood about it—there has been no communication about it with Armit and Burroughs of Dublin—I have not had any communication with any of Bouverie and Co s bank clerks about it—I have not been to Mr Dight—I have not subpoenaed Mr Netherclift to attend here on the part of the prosecution—he is not here—he was here yesterday—he was not in Court he was in the lobby—he was not here under a subpoena for the prosecution—I was at the Bankruptcy Court when Joel was taken into custody—I went by myself—Sergeant Mount accompanied the officer who took him—I did not direct him to be taken into custody he was in the box and Sergeant Mount went up to him with a warrant—I delivered Mr Pullman the brief—it was not a blank sheet of paper—the appointment at the Bankruptcy Court was I believe for two o clock I was there about that time—some cases were in the course of investigation before the Commissioner and I believe about three or half-past I saw Joel come in—I heard him called Lewis by some one who was speaking to him a friend I believe—he was then walking about the Court—he was standing in the witness-box when the officer spoke to him—Mr Pullman did not make any application to the Court he was instructed to watch The notice being ready was to produce a memorandum given by Chignell purporting to be a receipt or acknowledgment for the 1 000l bill the subject of this prosecution COURT to HENRY CHIGNELL Q Recollect as well as you can what it was the prisoner said when he came A He asked whether either of the partners were there I said it was before the office hours—I believe he then said he wanted to leave a paper and would I take it as he wanted to go to Brighton by the rail—he said it was a bill he did not say for what sum or describe it further—I am sure he said it was a bill and he asked me to give him a memorandum for it which I did and he left the paper with me—I did not read the paper at all Q Then how could yon give a memorandum for it A I gave a memorandum for a paper left with me in fact I had no glasses at the moment and could not see to read it—I merely gave him a memorandum for a memorandum given to me to give to one of the partners merely a memorandum that he had left a paper with me—that was all the information I received from him—my eyes did not without my glasses enable me to look and see the particulars of the paper—I did not look at it after he was gone and before I gave it to Mr Reeve—I put it into my desk and when Mr Reeve came I took it up and said Mr Reeve here is a paper left by Mr Joel for you will you take it and I gave it him—I really believe it was a paper of this description but I could not say what it was—I did not receive more than one paper from Joel which I gave to Mr Reeve— MR CLARKSON requested that the witness might be permitted to look at his deposition to refresh his memory as to what passed at this interview MR CHAMBERS objected if a contradiction was sought to be proved that could only be done in the case of an adverse witness and as to refreshing the memory of the witness that could only be done from a document in his own writing MR BODKIN said it was a matter entirely in the discretion of the Court MR JUSTICE TALFOURD thought that he should best exercise his discretion in not allowing the deposition to be used for this purpose Q Can you now recollect whether the prisoner when he brought you the document described it in any way or stated it to be anything A I believe he said I wish to leave a paper or a bill of exchange I do not recollect the words and that I believe ought to be in my evidence before the Magistrate—I said I did not know—I believe this to be the bill but I cannot swear it— the bill was here read HENRY JAMES REEVE re-examined by the COURT I believe this to be the paper I received from Chignell and gave to Mr Campbell—I have no doubt about it—I took a copy and it tallies with that copy—I received no other bill at any time from Chignell for 1 000l in which the parties were the same nor did I deliver any other bill to Mr Campbell of this description and amount JOHN THOMAS CAMPBELL re-examined by the COURT I had no other bill but this for 1 000l in my possession purporting to be drawn by the prisoner on the prosecutor—I think I showed this bill to the prisoner on two occasions when he called to pay a portion of the debt or rather the costs—he said it was a genuine bill and he could prove Mr Clements signed it—he did not make the slightest question about that being the bill he had brought to our office JAMES GORDON MURDOCH I am a partner in the house of Bouverie and Co bankers and was one of Mr Clements s guardians—I have had frequent opportunities of seeing him write and knowing his handwriting—I have carefully examined the acceptance to this bill—I do not believe it to be his handwriting—it resembles it—I must have first seen it in Nov 1849—it was shown to me by Mr Campbell—I believe I said it was like his writing—the arrangements that were made by Mr Pullman with respect to Mr Clements s embarrassments were made with my sanction—down to Nov last when this bill was shown to me by Mr Campbell I had never heard of any bill for 1 000l accepted by the prosecutor—yes I heard of it in Aug at the Croydon assizes—that was the first I had heard of it—I received this letter produced from the prisoner—it is dated Friday —I cannot say when I received it—I am not personally acquainted with the numbers of bills that Mr Joel made a demand upon—I had no communication with the prisoner on receiving this letter—I sent it to Mr Pullman—I received it before the Croydon assizes Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Are you in the habit of paying money over the counter on checks or bills A Yes I have paid drafts of Mr Clements s and several of my clerks also—I have occasionally paid them personally—the cashier Mr James would usually do that—he is in my employment now—he is not here—he has been in the habit of paying Mr Clements s drafts ever since he had an account at our house which was when he first entered the army I think—if this bill had been presented over the counter and 1 had not heard anything about it previously I should not have paid it if I had been there both on account of the largeness of the sum and a doubt of the handwriting—I think the writing would have prohibited me—I do not know whether it has ever been shown to my cashier—I was not a witness at the Police-court or before a Grand Jury—I gave authority for the arrangement of Mr Clements s affairs—I heard his statement on the subject of this bill before I saw it—my mind was prepared to suppose it was a forgery Q You say you employed Mr Pullman was that on your solicitation or on his A He objected to act at all without the sanction of the young man s guardians—we did not employ him as an agent but merely as a barrister—he was to be paid as a barrister—the terms on which we were to employ him were five guineas a day when he was employed on these affairs only if in Ireland—it was not positively stated how much he was to have in England—we have not come to a settlement there may be one other clerk in our house besides the cashier who knows Mr Clements handwriting—I have not directed the employment of Mr Netherclift to examine this signature—I never heard of his being employed—I think my answer to Mr Campbell when he asked me whether it was my ward s bill was It is like his handwriting —it was after that that the action was brought COURT Q Have you been the guardian of Mr Clements from the time of the death of his parents A Yes previously to going into the army he was with a gentleman at Liege a sort of military academy—he had been to school before that—he has been in the habit of corresponding with me from time to time in his boyhood when he was at Liege and since he became an officer not very frequently—I think Cox and Co negotiated the purchase of the cornetcy and lieutenancy—they did so under my sanction—and when he sold out also— Letter read 49 Strand Friday to Mr Murdock Sir I have taken the liberty of writing to you as Mr Clements guardian to beg that I may have an immediate settlement of my claim upon that gentleman I would not be so urgent but have 450l of his overdue bills and there being another due to-morrow for 300l which I do assure you I have not funds to meet and as I am but a few years in business the return of such a bill and my inability to meet it the consequences to me would be almost ruinous it cannot possibly make any difference to Mr Clements whether I am paid now or in a week hence and to me it is a matter of vital importance I merely ask that Mr Clements will act as fairly by me as I did by him begging that you will favourably consider what I have written and that I may be favoured with an early reply I am Sir your obedient servant LEWIS JOEL COURT to MR CLEMENTS Q Look at the signature and the body of that bill in whose handwriting do you believe them to be A I have not the least idea it certainly is not mine—the signature Lewis Joel is the prisoner s writing—I never accepted a bill in blank—I never wrote my description Lieutenant 13th Light Dragoons on a blank stamp—neither that or the name are in my handwriting GUILTY of Uttering Aged 25 —

t18500408-767  767 WILLIAM BAXTER feloniously and knowingly uttering a forged 5l Bank of England note with intent to defraud the Governor and Company of the Bank of England —2nd COUNT with intent to defraud George Compton MR CLARKSON and SIR JOHN BAYLEY conducted the Prosecution GEORGE COMPTON I keep the Crown in the Edgeware-road On 27th Feb about twelve o clock in the day I was in my bar parlour and saw the prisoner standing at the bar—Mrs Compton was serving—the bar is divided off into two departments a bottle department and a public department—they are divided by a partition from the wall to the counter—there are separate doors of entrance to each department—there is a smaller door to one and a larger door to the other—the prisoner was in the small department the bottle department—I heard him ask for a glass of wine and a cigar—he paid for it with a shilling—I heard him ask for something—I got up directly and said to him What is it you want —he said Will you oblige me with change for a 5l -note —I said Certainly and he laid a note on the counter—took it up looked at it and said Not for this this is a bad one and I said to a man named Wheeler Shut the door he did so—the prisoner said It is of no consequence I know where I took it —I told Wheeler to keep the door closed till I came back—I then went out at the other door and went to the station in Molyneux-street for a policeman—I took the note with me—I saw Beck gave him the note and told him to come back with me—he went in at the other door and I went to the door that was fastened—I knocked at it and Wheeler let me in—I went in and the prisoner said You will suffer for this —Beck then came in with the note io his hand and said to the prisoner Where did you get this note from —I asked him myself where he took it from and he said I took it from Mr Ellison of Spring-gardens —he hesitated a minute or two and then said Charing-cross —then Beck came round and asked him again and he said I took it from Mr Ellison 6 Spring-gardens Charing-cross mentioning the number—I then said That is the name that is marked on the back of the note — this is the note—I know it by this writing and also by the name of Clutton Bristol on it—Beck asked the prisoner where he came from if he had travelled by the railway as he bad a bag with him and he said I came by the railway from Birmingham giving us to understand that he had come from Birmingham that morning by the railway and a minute or two afterwards he said it was eleven years since he was at Birmingham—I cannot exactly say what he said that gave me to understand he had come that morning from Birmingham by the railway—Beck said By rail —he said Yes —I should say he gave me to understand it by his bag—he named Birmingham—he had a small bag with him and an overcoat on what is called a sack and a thickish scarf round his neck—I did not notice his under coat—he did not undo his overcoat while at my place—Beck took him to the station HILL BECK policeman D 127 I was at the police-station in Molyneux-street Edgeware-road about half-past twelve o clock on 27th Feb —Mr Compton came there with this 5l -note in his hand—I observed the name of Ellison Spring-gardens on it at the time and Clutton Bath-street —in consequence of what he told me I accompanied him back to his house—I went in at the large doors looked round the partition and saw the prisoner—I had the note in my hand I held it up and said Where did you get this from —I did not wait to hear his answer but said Wait and I will come round into the bottle department —when I got round I found the prisoner—he had this carpet-bag with him—I took it from him—I asked where he got the note from—he said a party gave it to him to come in and get change—in going to the station he said that two men had given it to him and afterwards he said a Mr Ellison of Spring-gardens Charing-cross gave it him—I did not ask where he lived—nothing was said in my hearing about Binningham—I searched the prisoner and found on him 6s 10d in silver and 3d in copper—I opened the carpet-bag in his presence—when I got him to the station I asked where he lived—he said at 196 Kent-street Borough—he was taken before the Magistrate and remanded—I took the note to the Bank and brought it back in the state in which it is now stamped Forged —I went that same evening to 196 Kent-street I did not find anything of the prisoner there—I went to 296 two or three days afterwards and found that the prisoner lived there with his father—I went to make inquiry at Spring-gardens the next day—I could not find any such person as Mr Ellison at No 6—I also inquired at No 7 and several houses and could find no such person Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did you make inquiries at all the houses A No not at every one WILLIAM ROBIN SELWAY I am clerk to Mr Burton the architect of 6 Spring-gardens I have been in his service upwards of fifteen years—during that time no person named Ellison has resided there JAMES WESTMORELAND policeman C 27 I have made inquiry in Spring-gardens after a person named Ellison—I have been to every house—it was last Wednesday—no such person was known at any house Cross-examined Q Did you say what your object was that it was about a forged note A I did at several places JOSHUA FREEMAN I am inspector of Bank-notes to the Bank of England This note is a forgery in all respects paper plate and signature—there is no water-mark—there is an attempt by pressure—this other note produced is also a forgery in every respect Cross-examined Q Have you ever known an instance of the Bank paying a forged note and refusing their own and afterwards finding it was a good one A No I never heard of it—I have heard of it in Court I never knew it happen—I have been thirty-nine years in the Bank—I can ascertain clearly that this is no water-mark—it is a note that might take persons in THOMAS DALE I assist my father who keeps the Marquis of Cornwallis in Marchmont-street Brunswick-square On Tuesday evening 26th Feb between eight and nine o clock the prisoner came to our bar accompanied by a servant in the neighbourhood who often comes for beer—I have since learnt that her name is Emma Diprose—she is here—she had been in the habit of coming to the house for supper-beer for a neighbour—he had a carpet bag with him—I have no doubt the one produced is the same—I saw it again on 12th March and knew it at once—they asked for two glasses of port wine I served them—my attention was then drawn off by other customers—I afterwards returned to them to get payment for the wine—they asked me if I had change for a 5l -note—I think the prisoner spoke first but I cannot be positive but the girl spoke out and said Can you change me a 5l -note —I heard him say something but I cannot swear what—I saw a 5l -note on the counter—I took it up and just looked at it I did not examine it—his coming with the girl altogether deprived me of suspicion because I had given change to the girl before for her mistress—I went to my desk and found I had not enough to do it with—I put the note on the counter and said I had not got change—the prisoner took it up—just at that time Holland the pot-boy came in for some beer and the girl said to him Oh here you will get me change and she took the note from the prisoner and passed it to the boy and he asked me if he should go—I said Yes you may go and see if you can get change for them —whilst he was gone I saw two sixpences lying on the counter close to where the note had laid—I said Is this your money —the prisoner said Yes and the girl said Yes two sixpences —the two glasses of port wine came to 8d —I gave them the difference—I did not notice who took it I think it was the prisoner—I have not the least doubt of it—I think I remember seeing him take it up but I should not like to swear it positively—Holland returned with the change—it consisted of four sovereigns and some silver—I said Here is your change —the prisoner took it up directly and they went away almost directly—when they first came in she said This is a brother of mine —the next I heard of it was on 6th March when I found the note Holland changed was a forgery—I cannot swear that this is the note—I know it is the note that was brought back to me by Weller Mr Beaumont s barman where Holland got change—I had not sent Holland out for any other 5l -note Cross-examined Q About the young woman saying the prisoner was her brother have yon recollected that to-day for the first time A No I do not know whether I named it before the Magistrate—I should say the prisoner was in my place near ten minutes—there were a good many persons there—I never saw him before—I believe I should have known him anywhere if I had met him—I do not know that there is anything particular about him—I had no doubt about him when I saw him in the House of Detention—I was sure it was him the moment I saw him—Holland did not express considerable doubt about him—he passed the cell and I said You had better look again —I had said the same to him previously when he passed another cell very quickly—I thought be had not time to look at the prisoner sufficiently and the second time he looked he said Yes that is the person —the young woman who came in with the prisoner is outside MR CLARKSON Q Look at the prisoner now and tell me whether you have any doubt that he is the man A No he was dressed in a dark-green coat cut off what is called a Newmarket and a great coat which he unbuttoned—he was in the same dress before the Magistrate WILLIAM HOLLAND On 26th Feb I was in the service of Mr Dale Between eight and nine o clock that evening I came out of the tap-room and saw the prisoner at the bar with a young woman—she asked me to go and get change for a 5l -note—my master gave me the note—I took it to Mr Beaumont s and asked Weller the barman to change it—he put the note on the desk and wrote master s name on it—I did not see what he wrote but I saw him writing—he put it into the desk—a young woman who came out of the parlour gave me the change four sovereigns and the rest in silver—I brought it back and placed it on the counter before the prisoner and the young woman—I did not see what became of it Cross-examined Q When you went to the House of Detention did you pass by the prisoner without recognising him A Yes at first my master said Look well at him —the first time I went by him very quick—I looked at him again and knew him—I looked at him two or three minutes the second time—I looked at his cell the same as I did at the others but my attention was not attracted till my master said that to me MR CLARKSON Q Did your master say that to you at any other cell you passed by A Yes he said a good many times Look well at them JOHN WELLER I am barman to Mr Beaumont of the Red Lion Guild-ford-street On the evening of 26th Feb Holland came for change for a 5l -note which he handed to me—my master s sister gave him four sovereigns and 1l -worth of silver—I wrote on the note Mr Dale Marchmont-street —this is it—master was about to pay it away on 6th March and the clerk detected it to be a forgery Cross-examined Q Had you changed any other 5l -note that day A I do not know we change them very frequently—we always put on them the name of the person we take them from—I changed no other for Mr Dale that night GUILTY

t18500408-770  770 ALBERT MERMINOD feloniously forging and uttering a bill of exchange for 150l with intent to defraud Solomon Cahn and another —2nd COUNT with intent to defraud Angela Burdett Coutts and others MR COOPER conducted the Prosecution The prisoner being a foreigner and unable to speak English had the evidence interpreted to him HENRY WILLIAM HODINOTT I am a cab-proprietor living at 20 Great Blind-street Dover-road On 20th March I was on the stand in Upper Thames-street—the prisoner came up to me and asked whether I could speak French—I said I could not—I took him to a friend of mine Mr Unsworth on Fish-street-hill—he there took a little pocket-book from hit side pocket took from it two pieces of paper and asked for pen and ink having spoken some words previously—he laid the papers down on the counter took the pen and wrote about eleven or twelve words looking at the bill —It was something like this that he wrote—when he took his hand up I saw an S —I cannot say that I saw him make all the words—he was writing on the paper—he put his pen in the ink and wrote some words and when he lifted up his hand I saw the letter S —I should say that his pen made marks by the way he was writing—I was standing close by him—I cannot swear that the S was not there before—I should say he was writing—he was moving his hand and when he had done he took it up and looked at it as if to see that it was done correctly and he handed them to Mr Unsworth—I did not notice whether the ink was wet or dry—after this was done I was told to fetch a cab and the prisoner and Mr Unsworth got in—I drove them to Messrs Coutts bank in the Strand—I there got off my box to let them out and I saw the prisoner give Mr Unsworth two pieces of paper which Mr Unsworth took into Messrs Coutts —the prisoner remained in the cab—after Mr Unsworth had been the bank a short time somebody left the bank and came to me—in consequence of which I remained by my cab—after about a quarter of an hour Mr Unsworth came out—the prisoner came with him—he had gone into the bank to Mr Unsworth—they got into the cab again and I drove to Copthall-chambers Prisoner Q How long after I spoke to you on the rank was it that you took me to Mr Unsworth A I should say not two minutes—you got out of the cab before it arrived at Coutts —I should say you waited quite a quarter of an hour in the cab before you went into the bank JAMES UNSWORTH I keep an eating-house at 37 Fish-street-hill On Wednesday 20th March the prisoner and Hodinott came to my house—the prisoner asked me for pen and ink which I gave him—he then pulled out his pocket-book took out two papers and put them down on the counter—he then took the pen and ink but what he wrote I could not tell—I could not swear that he even wrote upon it—I was some distance away—he then gave me the bills to look at—I do not remember anything that was written on them I did not take any notice I was looking to see where he wanted to go by the bills—I did not notice whether the ink was fresh or not—he told me one was for 150l and the other 100l and he wished to go to Coutts bank—he asked if I had got any money as he had no money of his own and I lent him 5s —we then went in the cab—when we got about half or threequarters of a mile from Coutts bank he told me to stop the cab which I did and he got out and went into a stationer s shop—he stopped there about two minutes—I was afraid he would be too late at the bank to get the notes changed and went in to fetch him—he came out with me and we then proceeded to the bank—on the road he said I might take the change in what money I thought proper either in gold or notes—on reaching the bank he gave me the two bills out of his pocket and I took them into the bank and presented them both at the counter—these produced are them—on presenting them the clerks began to whisper one to the other and refused payment—I asked them to have the kindness to go and not let the cabman go away—in about a quarter of an hour the prisoner came into the bank and asked for Mr Cahn s address—nothing occurred there to make him ask that—nothing was said about Mr Cahn—the address was given and I left the bank with the prisoner—I told the cab man to drive to the address which the banker s clerk had given me and the prisoner pressed me to go to Mr Cahn s—we went and saw Mr Cahn—I gave him the two bills which I had kept in my possession—the prisoner was by at the time—Mr Cahn examined them and said he should keep them he should not deliver them back—the prisoner immediately said if Mr Cahn would pay him his passage there and back to Paris he would be satisfied Prisoner Q Did I mention to you the name of Mr Cahn A You did you explained to me why you got out of the cab—you did not ask me Mr Cahn s address in the cab but immediately you came into the bank—when we came out from the bank you said I had misunderstood you as regarded presenting the bills—that was in the cab—when we arrived at Mr Cahn s I cannot recollect whether I spoke English or French but I suppose I must have spoken English MR COOPER Q Are you certain that he told you to present these bilk and get them cashed in paper or gold A Yes COURT Q But did he tell you to present them at Coutts A He did—he asked me for Coutts and Co at my house before we went—I looked it the bottom of the bills to see to whom they were addressed—he told me by word of mouth to drive to Coutts SALOMON CAHN I am a merchant in partnership with my brother at 3 Copthall Chambers The endorsement Solomon Cahn to this 150l -bill was not written by me or with my authority—it was brought to me by Unsworth and the prisoner—I told them that the bills must either have been lost or stolen and I should detain them—we expected such bills from Cahn Brothers of Paris relations of mine—I asked the prisoner particularly whether he had been to Messrs Coutts to get the money—he said No —I looked at the back of the bills and saw that our signature had been forged—I immediately suspected that he must have been to Messrs Coutts to get the money because the bills are acquitted—that is the usual acquittance—it is in French but that makes no difference they would have paid it just the same—in order to obtain the money from Coutts when bills are so directed it is necessary to write that—I asked the prisoner again to tell me whether he had been to Messrs Coutts to get the money and then he said he had been there to find out our address—that was not very likely—then Mr Unsworth who had not said anything all the while said to me That is the biggest lie that was ever told because we went up to Messrs Coutts in the cab and he told me particularly to get the money for him either in notes or in gold —the prisoner afterwards said when I asked how he became possessed of the bills that he was taking a walk in Paris and met a young man who bad these bills in his hand and he was going to tear them up that he went up to him and told him it was a great pity to tear those bills up he would go over to London I do not exactly recollect whether he said he would deliver them or get the money for them but he said something to that effect—I then gave him into custody Prisoner Q Did not I tell you I was innocent and that the young man wished to give the bills back to Messrs Cahn and Co of Paris A Yes something to that effect—you may have said you begged the young man not to burn them and you would undertake to bring them to London and doubtless we should indemnify you for your journey—you said at first that you would go to Paris to fetch the letter that was missing and immediately afterwards you pulled out the letter with the half of a 300l bank-note which was also missing—you said those were the rest of the things that the young man had given you and they would prove you to be an honest man—you said we should receive an assurance from abroad with some papers in connection with this affair which would prove your innocence—I have received two letters from you since you have been in prison and one from Paris FREDERICK GEORGE I am a clerk in Messrs Coutts bank On 20th March two bills for 150l and 100l were brought to the bank—these produced are them—they were presented and refused—we had had notice to reject them Prisoner Q Did Mr Unsworth make any observation to you when he delivered the bills A Yes not to let the cowman go away—that was after they were refused—he did not make any observation as he presented the bills—it was not to me he spoke I was engaged in another part of the bank at the time ROBERT TAYLOR City-policeman 144 I have produced the bills they have been in my custody ever since I received them at the station—I took the prisoner into custody and found on him this pocket-book a half-franc part of a letter with the signature torn off containing half of a 300l -note and two passports Prisoner Q Did you find the letter containing the bank-note A No you produced it from your pocket previous to my searching you and gave it to the prosecutor—as I was taking you from Guildhall to the prison you were addressed by a gentleman from the Swiss Consul The prisoner read in French a long defence which was interpreted to the Jury and in which he stated that on 19th March he met a young man with whom he was intimately acquainted in a coffee-house in Paris who stated that he had found the papers in question and after some hesitation admitted having forged the signature of Messrs Cahn to the bills that he advised him to restore them to Messrs Cahn Brothers of Paris but he refused to do so and declared to intention of starting at once for London that he the prisoner after in vain remonstrating with him offered to bring the bills to London but that his sole object in doing so was to deliver them up to Messrs Cahn in the hope of receiving some remuneration for his honesty that he received from the young man whose name he had sworn not to divulge the passports and papers found on him and came to London for that purpose that his only object in going to Messrs Coutts was to obtain Messrs Cahn s address and that all he had done to the bill at the eating-house was to rectify the date GUILTY of Uttering Aged 20 — Transported for Ten Years

t18500506-908  908 ZADOC FADERMAN SAUL LAURIO and BERNARD GORDON were indicted for that certain foreign undertakings for the payment of money of the empire of Russia were made issued negociated and circulated in the said empire and that the prisoners did feloniously engrave and make upon 4 plates 4 several parts of an undertaking for the payment of money purporting to be parts of an undertaking of the said empire of Russia without the authority of the said State There were 29 other Counts in some of which the instrument was called a promissory note and in others an order and in some the engravings were set out with translations and in the last 6 Counts not The ATTORNEY-GENERAL with Mr CLARKSON and Mr BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution This case originally came before MR JUSTICE WILLIAMS at the last Feb Sessions when MR HUDDLESTON with MESSRS PARRY and METCALFE on behalf of the prisoners demurred to the indictment the argument was then partly heard and at the suggestion of the learned Judge the matter was reserved for the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal that Court however being of opinion that it had no jurisdiction in cases of demurrer the point now came on for argument here MR HUDDLESTON first called the attention of the Court to the last six counts which were framed under 2 & 3 Wm IV c 123 s 3 and contended that that Act did not apply to such an offence as the present but to cases of forgery only See Reg v Harris 7 Car & Payne 429 and with respect to the counts generally he submitted that the original instrument parts of which the prisoners were charged with engraving should have been set out in the indictment together with a translation so that this Court or a Court of Error might see from the nature of the instrument itself whether it came within the meaning of the Act of Parliament The word purporting used in the Act of Parliament and in the indictment showed the necessity of a reference to the instrument said to be imitated for in no other manner could the Court see that the parts in question purported to be anything there being nothing in them to show to what country or what coin they had reference and that the mere averment in the indictment that certain instruments were current in Russia was not enough for that purpose References—2 Chitty s Crim Law 1040 Mason s case 2 East s Pleas of the Crown 975 Lyons case 2 Leech 608 Lloyd s case 2 East 976 Gilchrist s case 2 East and Reg v Goldstein 7 Moor p 1 MR PARRY followed in support of the demurrer and as the reply was arranged to be confined to MR HUDDLESTON he was also heard upon the question as to what the judgment of the Court would be if the demurrer was overruled He argued that the prisoners should be allowed to plead over in as much as the demurrer did not amount to a confession of the fact but only to a request to the Court to express an opinion whether in point of law there was anything to call on the prisoners to answer That this course had been generally permitted not perhaps on principles of pleading but upon principles of humanity was evident from the following authorities Archibald s Crim Pleading 87 2 Hale s Pleas of Crown 256 and 225 Reg v Purchase Car and Marshman 617 Reg v Phelps ditto and Rex v Adams 297 ditto Gray s case 11 Clark and Finelly 427 Reg v Odgers Moody and Rob Reg v Bennett 1 Car and Kir 504 Reg v Duffy 4 Cox s Crim Cases 24 and Reg v Serva 2 Car and Kir 53 and 2 Cox s Crim Cases 439 MR METCALFE with reference to the last point contended that the judgment should be respondeat ouster and that a demurrer did not involve a confession it being an acknowledged principle that nothing could be admitted in a criminal case and with respect to the first question in addition to the arguments already adduced he urged that the law of Russia applicable to instruments of this description should also appear on the face of the indictment that the Court might see whether that which prisoners were charged with imitating as well as that which the prisoners had done came within that law See Storey s Conflict of Laws 527 Trimbey s case 1 Bingham s new cases Rothschild v Currie 1 Queen s Bench Reports Benham v Earl of Mornington 3 Common Bench Reports 133 and Astley v Fisher 18 Law Journal 59 and 6 Com Bench Reports The ATTORNEY-GENERAL maintained that the last six counts which were framed under 2 & 3 Wm IV c 123 in connexion with 1 Wm IV c 66 were sufficient to support the present charge and with respect to the remaining counts he denied the necessity of setting out the complete instrument it might be that no such complete instrument was in existence as for instance where a foreign State issued a notice that on a given day notes of a particular character would be put into circulation and where in anticipation of that event documents were forged intended to be substituted for the genuine ones it could not be contended that that would not amount to an offence or that in such a case any complete instrument could be set out with regard to the present case the averment that such instruments were negociable in Russia was sufficient for if the instrument were set out and the slightest variation between it and the forged plates were detected it would vitiate the indictment it was enough if on the face of them they purported to be that which they were intended to represent With regard to the last question he contended that the judgment must be final the demurrer being in reality a confession of the fact and that the instances quoted where prisoners were allowed to plead over applied to capital cases only when that course was permitted in favorem vitae MR HUDDLESTON was heard in reply THE COURT took until the next morning to consider the points when MR BARON ALDERSON delivered judgment He stated that the Court was of opinion that the demurrer must be overruled and for the purpose of overruling it it was quite sufficient that any one of the counts would sustain a judgment in case the prisoners had pleaded and been convicted under it The first question to be ascertained was the meaning of the word purporting and it appeared to the Court that it must be construed in this way that if the instrument in question were a complete one then it must appear on the face of it that it purported to be as it was described but where the word was applied to part of a bill note &c it could not be construed in the same unlimited sense seeing that part of a bill note &c could not purport to be anything but it must mean that it was part of the thing which if completed would purport to be that which was described in the Act of Parliament and that must be shown not by setting out the instrument on the face of the indictment but by averment and extrinsic proof Here the parts were set forth as they were proposed to be proved with averments which if true showed that they were parts of an undertaking current in Russia and in the opinion of the Court the first batch of counts was sufficient to sustain a judgment of that kind The last six counts in the opinion of the Court were not sufficient on the ground that they did not come within 2 & 3 Wm IV c 123 that Act being confined to indictments for forgery and to complete instruments With respect to the more difficult and important question namely the judgment to be given upon the demurrer being overruled the Court had taken time to refer to the older authorities on the subject this being a question which had seldom arisen in modern times and it seemed to them that the judgment must be final It appeared clear when the matter was fully investigated that any plea which was in confession and avoidance of the felony if adjudged against a prisoner subjected him always to final judgment The principal authorities on the subject were to be found in cases of appeals in felony It was clear that there were many dilatory and declinatory pleas which left the question of guilt or innocence unconfessed it was the practice in those cases to plead not guilty and a declinatory plea together those pleas as mentioned by Lord Hale were not held bad for doubleness as it was allowed in favorem vitae and this was the solution of all the difficulties which apparently existed on the subject There was distinct authority to show that if any plea in confession and avoidance of the felony was determined against a party he was not allowed to plead over but judgment was then final and a decision by all the Judges to that effect would be found in the Year-book of 14th Edward IV c 7 placitum 10 It seemed to the Court that the rule which was applied to the cases of plea governed demurrers also where the plea was dilatory alone such as a plea in abatement or a plea to the jurisdiction which might well stand with a plea of not guilty there if judgment was against the prisoner on his dilatory plea he was permitted indeed he had a right to be tried on his plea of not guilty but where the plea was in confession and avoidance of the felony the real and true judgment of the law always was a judgment final and it was only by the indulgence of the Court that the party was afterwards allowed to plead not guilty If that was so it was decisive of the present question because here there was nothing on the record except the demurrer there was no plea of not guilty pleaded with it neither could there be The Court was therefore of opinion on the whole case this being a general demurrer that it did contain a confession and that judgment must be final The modern authorities referred to appeared to be only dicta at Nisi Prius hastily given and were not entitled to the weight which would have attached to them if the learned Judges had had the opportunity now afforded to the Court of consulting the authorities on the subject MR PARRY appealed to the Court to extend its indulgence to the prisoners and allow them to plead over but the Court did not accede to the application The prisoners were sentenced to be Transported for Ten Years

t18500610-1152  1152 FRANCIS JOHNSON feloniously forging and uttering an acquittance and receipt for 1l 18s with intent to defraud Robert Warner and others —Other COUNTS with intent to defraud our Lady the Queen MESSRS CLARKSON and ROBINSON conducted the Prosecution HUGH LAWRENCE I am a clerk in the Post-office I produce a Post-office order CHARLES BUSWELL I am an ironmonger and reside at Lutterworth I deal with Messrs Warner—on 15th May 1848 I owed them 2l 2s 7d —I sent them a Post-office order that day for 1l 13s —this produced is it—the discount reduced the amount to 1l 18s —next day I received this acknowledgment for the order—I never paid 3s 9d off that account—I never sent up any old metal to Messrs Warner Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Is there anybody in your establishment that might have sent up old metal without yout knowing it A No we send our old metal to Birmingham ROBERT WARNER I carry on business with my two brothers as brass-founders and engineers in Jewin-crescent The prisoner has been in our employ some years as junior clerk in the counting-house—he was in the habit of keeping No 1 Ledger in which Mr Buswell s account is entered—it was his duty to receive money and to hand it over to me or the cashier— looking at the ledger —on 16th May 2l 2s 7d was owing from Mr Buswell—if he paid cash the discount would reduce it to 1l 18s —if a Post-office order was sent up and received by the prisoner it would be his duty to hand it over to me or the cashier and make an entry of it in this book—there is no such entry—this letter is the prisoner s writing and also the writing on the Post-office order— Received the above John Warner and Sons —that is the name by which the firm has gone for some years—it is not for John Warner and Sons —he never had authority to sign my name or the name of the firm—we invariably send Post-office orders through our bankers—this order has not got the bankers receipt—there is no entry in the cash-book of any Post-office order about that date—there is an entry on 15th Aug 3s 9d cash received of Charles Buswell of Lutterworth —by that entry the prisoner charges himself with 3s 9d —that would import that the 3s 9d settled the account and that it had been handed over to me or the cashier—it is our custom to receive old metal from our customers and make an allowance for it—here is an entry on the credit side of Mr Buswell s account in the prisoner s writing on 25th March of 25lbs of metal 1l 18s 10d —if that was properly entered it would be got from the old metal book and there is no entry there of any metal received from Mr Buswell—this entry of 3s 9d is in my writing—I got that out of the rough cash-book—the entry there is in Arm field s the cashier s writing—that 3s 9d and the 1l 18s 10d makes 2l 2s 7d so that those two entries appear to balance that item—it is a false entry altogether—my brothers are here Cross-examined Q The prisoner of course had authority to sign receipts A For us just in the same way as he signed the order—the correct mode is to sign For John Warner and Sons so-and-so—that has always been the practice of clerks in our firm—they are all aware of our practice—we give him power to acquit our debtors if he receives the money MR ROBINSON Q Do you know any instance where the prisoner in my legitimate transaction has signed your name without also putting his own A Never WILLIAM WHITE I am a clerk in the Money-order Office in the Post-office When money is paid into a branch office a letter of advice is sent up to the Post-office—the letter of advice would be kept twelve months and then destroyed—it would contain the name of the person to whom the order is to be paid—the order itself does not contain any name—I paid this order—the name of John Warner and Sons was on it at the time I paid it—I cannot tell who presented it—I know that name was put on it or else I should not have paid it Cross-examined Q If it had been signed John Warner and Sons F Johnson you would not have paid it A Certainly not—this order has not passed through a banker—it was paid at the window ROBERT WARNER re-examined The order must be signed by us before it is sent to our bankers —the prisoner would have no right to sign his own name for John Warner and Sons and then pay it through our bankers —I should object to that because he had no authority to do it—the receipt to this order is not the writing of or written by the authority of any member of our firm—the letter containing the order must have been opened by the prisoner as he acknowledged the receipt of it—he has received very large sums of money—he could not believe that he had authority to sign my name—I never led him to believe so quite the contrary MR BALLANTINE in addressing the Jury contended that this only amounted to an excess of authority on the part of the prisoner and not to such a false making as constituted a forgery The RECORDER directed the Jury that if they were satisfied that he did the act in question without the authority of the firm and with an intention of defrauding them they might find him guilty GUILTY of forging and uttering Aged 29 — Transported for

other—on Thursday 18th July this letter produced came to the counting-house by post I opened it—it contained this check produced —we had at that time an account with Miss Sarah Hawes—I think the signature to the check resembles hers—I directed some inquiries to be made about it—we did not pay it JOHN BONCEY I am barman to Mr Watts who keeps the Victory tavern in Trafalgar-road Greenwich I know the prisoner by sight—I did not know him by name—on 17th July he came to our house and showed me this check—he asked me to write him a note—I told him I could not I was so busy—he said it would not take me a minute to write what he wanted—I said I could not—he then said the evening would do so as to save the morning s post—he then gave me a sheet of note-paper and this check—this is the paper he gave me and I wrote on it what he directed—I wrote the exact words he told me and he desired me to sign my name for John Johnson—I did so—I wrote it in the evening after my work was done—he left the paper and check with me about half-past two o clock—he then said if Mr Rivers was at home he would cash the check for him without troubling me to write—he did not say who Mr Rivers was—I knew him as the lieutenant of Greenwich Hospital—he did not return that evening—I acted entirely on what he told me—after writing the note I enclosed it with the check in this envelope sealed it and directed it as it is now directed according to the prisoner s direction and put it in the post next morning—he had directed me to do so—next evening 18th this letter produced was brought to my master s house by the postman—I went to the hospital and inquired for the prisoner by the name of Johnson—I could not find him by that name but I saw him sitting in the ward and told him a letter had come for him—he said he did not expect it so soon—he came with me—the postman gave him the letter and he signed his name for it J Johnson —he was then taken into custody— check read— Lubbock bankers

principal officers at the Mansion-house On the evening of 18th July from information I received I went to the Victory tavern Trafalgar-road Greenwich and took the prisoner into custody—I found this letter in his possession also this tobacco-box containing this draft for 8l on Messrs Lubbock with a receipt-stamp pinned to it this other draft on Lubbock and Co for 150l and this order for 60l and other papers—I told him I had to take him into custody for sending an order up to Lubbock s the bankers—he said he had sent it but he had found it in this box among the other papers and the reason he sent it was because he thought Mr Lubbock would give him something for finding it—he gave his name as John Johnson Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was it after you got to the Victory that the barman went to fetch the prisoner A Yes COURT Q At the time he told you he found the papers in the tobacco-box had you found the box on him or did he produce it A I had searched him and found it on him THOMAS HARDING I am a clerk in the house of Lubbock and Co —this 8l check was presented to me as cashier about two months ago—I do not know by whom—I refused payment and returned it to the person who brought it—it was rather a young man Cross-examined Q You pay checks A Yes I should not have paid this 100l check at the same time I say it bears a considerable resemblance to Miss Hawes writing—I never knew Miss Hawes write Lubbock bankers —I never paid her checks on plain paper—she has a check-book— I cannot make out whether the signature is L or S Hawes or whether it is either of those—it may be E MR BODKIN Q Is that a check of Miss Hawes that has been paid produced A Yes and paid by me—this is written Fifty pond and 5 put where 50l ought to be—I saw that but paid it—the figures 50 were added by myself—I should not have paid it to a stranger—Hawes and Co have an account at our house—we have no other individual account in the name of Hawes MR PAYNE Q Do Hawes and Co ever sign checks with a single name A They do but they are placed to the debit of the joint account—the account was opened by Thomas and William Hawes and we answer the checks of either JOHN KEOGH I am boatswain of the

he was a mate there—I understand he was removed from there on account of illness and then placed as a common man in my ward—I got him from the Infirmary—the mates have a great deal to do—I heard of his being placed in confinement—I did not see him there because he did not belong to my ward at that time COURT Q As far as he came within your observation within the last month did he appear to know

expenses for going and give you something for your trouble —Mr Markham remarked that being Saturday the banking-house closed at three o clock and it would be closed before I could get up there—the

there—I keep an account at the house of Lubbock and Co and am in the habit of drawing checks upon them—this check is not my handwriting nor was it written by my authority—the signature resembles mine—I never wrote a check on blank paper I always have an engraved form CHARLES CUTHBERT I am a corn-dealer and live at Kennington-cross I know the prisoner well—he was a fellow-servant of mine for twelve or thirteen years with Messrs Hawes the soap and candle-manufacturers in Lambeth—I know his handwriting—I believe this check for 100l to be his writing and also these for 150l and 8l —he left

The following written statement put in by the prisoner before the Magistrate was read — My Lord your humble petitioner is a poor wornout seaman being many years fighting for his country during the late war which the Lords of the Admiralty for my services that I done for my country sent me down to that noble asylum Greenwich My Lord I was in the battle with Nelson when he lost his life I am now turned seventy-one years of age I have been sorely wounded in the head that I am at times in a deranged state of mind My Lord I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge I have only been six weeks discharged from the strong-room in the Infirmary of Greenwich Hospital which can be proved by Sir John Liddell the doctor of Greenwich Hospital I trust in God my Lord you and my prosecutors will show me mercy and send me down to Greenwich and they will keep me confined at the hospital I have an only daughter I am afraid it will break her heart if I am sent to prison I hope my Lord you will show me mercy for God s sake as we all expect mercy from God I can assure you I know not what I have done or what has been done —Your humble petitioner Dixon Dawson My Lord and Gentlemen your most humble petitioner states that it is upwards of sixty years ago since I first went to sea the first engagement I was in was the landing of the British troops in Egypt in 1801 when Sir Ralph Abercrombie lost his life the next was in the year 1803 in cutting out of Cape Legat a large armed schooner full of Spanish and French troops and I received many severe blows on the head which caused me to be in a deranged state of mind now I have advanced in years and at times to be very troublesome I likewise was on board the Victory in the battle of Trafalgar with my Lord Nelson when he fell wounded I likewise was wounded at the same time and fell close to him on the quarter-deck of the Victory on that glorious day 21st Oct 1805 and in 1807 I was in Gaeta in Italy when the French army stormed the fort I was in and there I was slightly wounded in four places and was at the taking of the Island of Capua the mouth of Naples Bay from there went to land Generals Moore and Fox on the Calabria shore and beat the French army back into Naples from there I was sent with Sir Samuel Hood to take Madeira which we did succeed and was engaged off Guadaloupe in the West Indies with two frigates French and seven batteries on our ship for two hours and forty minutes and likewise burning two frigates belonging to the French and taking the island of Martinique in 1809 came home to England and was sent on board the Fatale Minotaur seventy-four guns I was one of the first men on board the eleven Danish gun-boats that our ships destroyed by fire under the batteries of Copenhagen In coming to England our ship was lost and 600 men with her I had to swim three miles and was two hours and three-quarters in the sea before I got on Camperdown made prisoner-of-war of and sent to France remained nearly four years in Valenciennes half-starved and when the French were in full retreat from Moscow we were marched 600 miles in that dreadful winter in 1814 through frost and snow and almost naked and nearly starved My Lord I was never in prison in my life for any crime till now I hope and trust in God that some humane gentleman will come forward and plead my cause and snatch two human beings from the brink of ruin the daughter from a broken heart and the father that will never be able to look up any more through disgrace if Mr Hawes is in Court I call on him to be so kind as to give me a character since 1816 to July 1850 and I will for ever pray for all My Lord and gentlemen I hope you will help me in the means of procuring a gentleman of the law to plead for me I am afraid if I am found guilty of losing my home for life Witnesses for the Defence MART DAWSON I now live at 48 Roupell-street Lambeth and get a precarious living by washing and ironing—the prisoner is my father—I have heard him say that he has received wounds in his head—on 23rd February I received a letter from him an invitation and went down to Greenwich and met him at the terminus—he said he had been waiting since ten o clock—he threw his arms round my neck said God bless you and began to cry —I felt ashamed and endeavoured to soothe him—I had seen him two or three weeks before—I went with him to the hospital but could not prevail on him to sit or stand still a minute—he said he had been very bad since he saw me he had a burning pain in his head and he had not been to bed for three nights and that they had kindly accommodated him to sleep on the benches as he could not sleep in bed and as it was cold they had been kind enough to light a fire at five o clock to make him more comfortable—he said if the pain in his head continued he should go out of his mind—he got very much worse in the evening and I felt very much alarmed—he said he was so sorry he could not go with me but he could not hold his head up he sat on a bench resting his head on his hand—I do not remember seeing him again before 11th March my business would not allow me to go down—on 11th March I received this letter from him— read— Greenwich Hospital March 11th 1850 My Dear and only loving Daughter —I am happy to inform you that the Lord of Hosts has been pleased to hear the prayers of a poor penitent sinner the Lord has

confidence for the salvation of your soul and my soul and the forgiveness of our sins for ever O my Father in heaven never let us be confounded in our hopes for Jesus Christ s blood s sake that was spilt on Calvary for the redemption of our souls O my soul praise the Lord My dear I do not stand in need of a schoolmaster nor a physician I have applied to the Great One To Miss Dawson No 24 Roupell-street Cornwall-road Lambeth Surrey —at the time he wrote this his hearing and sight were not restored—he is deaf now I have been obliged to get permission to have him close to the rails of the prison to make him hear—a fortnight or less after writing that letter he came to my house and said he was quite in want of refreshments he had come up for four days and mast be nursed like a baby and I must do it—he raved so for different people to be fetched that I thought it best to send for them and when they came he scarcely spoke to them—I tried to get him home at the end of the four days but he would not go—he went out for an hour or two to go to Chelsea and lost himself and did not come home till six o clock at night next day he was so much worse his face was so red that I was afraid he would go raving mad and got him out—he said he had met with an omnibus-man who would take him down to Greenwich for 3d —I wanted to see the man and he got in a passion and set out to go by the train then he said he would walk—I got him to a public-house in the Kent-road and when I told him he must go home he stamped and raved and the police came he went through the public-house out at the other door—I got him a good way down the Kent-road and he would go no further and I was obliged to go to Walworth with him to see a person to get him borne and we went by the train to Greenwich-Hospital I was from eleven o clock till four getting him home—shortly after he came to me again and said he had come for four days more—I was very much surprised as I knew if he had his senses he would know I was not able to keep him he came on Wednesday and staid till Thursday afternoon—he made this paper out at my house produced it has the name of Mr Rivers on it he is a lieutenant—I thought it was a forgery and sent it to Mr Williams at the Discount-office and told him to take no notice of it he said he would not—that was about the middle of May—he once sent me two looking-glasses and a pair of plated candlesticks and said that he should come home with his pockets full of gold and then how I should smile— Mary he said you will never believe me but you will see what I shall give you I will take a farm what would you like —should you like a farm we can get one for eighty pounds a year and you shall have a servant to wait on you and nothing to do but to ring the bell for you have worked long enough and hard enough —at that time I am sure we could not produce five shillings between the two of us—when the man brought the glasses I said I have my bonnet on now to get him confined at Greenwich take them away do not let him see —I went to Mr Williams again and got the loan-paper to take to Greenwich to show that he was not in his right mind but was too late to get it—I was told I must send him down by a policeman for they could not interfere—I did not do so because I was afraid he would be worse—I came home and found him stretched out in the passage across the doorway with his hat doubled up under his head and he wanted to stay there all night—in the morning I persuaded him to get up at seven o clock and get off and I understood from him that he was called before the council but he came back the same day one of the neighbours ran to tell me he was in the streets again—I ran after him got him home and kept him that day and part of the next—he kept wandering from one doctor to another saying What a dreadful state my head is in all faces coming before my eyes —after chapel on Sunday evening I heard he was driving about in a cab—I conld not find him—I went to Tower-street station and told the police to take him up and take him to Greenwich—they sent for me and I found he was started off to Greenwich—I followed and found him in the guard-house he had been away all Saturday Sunday and Monday night Whit-Monday —I saw him again on the Sunday after—he said What a while you have been coming have you got the money if you had only let me stop in town I should have got the money —he said to Mr Williams who was going to London Will you send me the money —Mr Williams said Yes —at the time he wrote the paper proposing the repayment in two months he had not the slightest means of repayment—on the Sunday week after Whit-Monday he begged me to give him some money I gave him twopence—he seemed thoroughly rejoiced and said Now I have got money —next day he sent me a letter but I did not take it in I knew there was nothing of importance in it—I asked him afterwards what he sent the letter for he said he wanted some money—three weeks after I had him confined I found him standing in my street in a pouring rain looking for me he went wandering about to see if he could get some money—I never knew him signing people s names before he got bad in his head a stricter honest man never was he used to take my clothes home—this letter produced is his writing it is from another loan-office the Waterloo —I sent to them and told them he was insane but they took his money three shillings and told me they should give me in charge of the police if I insisted on having it back—I never knew him apply for money before he got bad in his head—he was very contented and when he obtained the situation of mate in Nelson s Ward he rejoiced because he could help me Cross-examined by MR BODKINS Q Your father has always behaved affectionately to you A He was a very good father—he has been at Greenwich about twelve months—he was in Christchurch workhouse before that I used to go and see him there—he spoke of his mates coming from Greenwich to me with him but I never saw any one—I found that what he said about his resting in the galley and having a fire lighted for him was quite true—he was in the full office of mate when he was so bad and when he spoke of wanting money—it was just after the 11th of March when the letter was written that he began to have a desire for money—when he came out of the Infirmary he was reduced from the office of mate and sent into the other ward—he had not been addicted to drinking for the last few years—I never saw him in liquor but once in three years that was when he was first-mate I saw him not quite sober and reproached him with it—I can judge between drunkenness and madness—when be was put into the strong-room I spoke to a medical gentleman connected with the hospital—my father only came to me once after that—he never told me and I had no reason to expect that he was writing checks on Lubbock s RICHARD SWAN I am a butcher of Cross-street Blackfriars-road I have known the prisoner twenty years—since he left the workhouse and went to Greenwich I have seen a great change in his manner—three or four months back he came to me and said he had plenty of money coming to him as he had been kept out of it so long—once he came and wanted a joint of me and once to borrow a half-crown or 5s —I was cautioned by his daughter as he was not right in his mind not to let him have any—he was sober but looked very wild about the head and eyes which were staring almost out of his head and the same when he wanted the joint—on Saturday nights when he had a little drop of beer he had a little wilder appearance he had always a peculiar way of acting—if he had had a glass of beer he would speak his mind pretty freely Cross-examined Q I suppose like most seafaring men he was fond of drink when he could get it A I never saw him drunk in my life—since he has been at Greenwich I have observed more wildness about his eyes than before JAMES WILLIAMS I am in the Surrey and Metropolitan Loan and Discount-office Stamford-street About the middle of May the prisoner came there he said he wanted a 100l and bow was he to obtain it—I told him he must give three securities—this is one of our forms produced —he took it away and afterwards brought it back filled up—I think I saw him about four times other clerks saw him besides—he had not said ten words before I discovered he must be insane for I have lost a wife insane and have seen a great deal of it—it is usual to charge 2d for the form but I did not ask him for it not wishing to irritate him—he brought it back drew his pen through the word Rivers and said he would put another and I found he had put his own name so that he was to be one of the securities himself—I said I would give it every attention—he came about four times once he said Well have you attended to that I said Being so far off business has prevented me —he said quickly You could not let us have a sovereign on account could you —he asked if a young woman had been there about him—I said Why do you ask —he said My daughter will come about me but take no notice of her for she is as mad as a March hare —he appeared to me to be not in his right mind—the form has never been filled up properly JOHN GEORGE EAGLE I am a shoemaker and have known the prisoner fourteen years—I have seen him within the last few months—he applied to me for money to make a deposit to get loans with and promised to set me up in business when he came into his money that he would take two houses and turn them into one—I never found that he had the means of doing it this was about two months ago—he used to come and sit in my place wishing me to give him money Cross-examined Q He told you it was necessary to pay something to obtain a loan that was correct A Yes I gave him 2s CHARLES BIGNELL I am boatswain of Nelson s Ward The prisoner was mate in that ward he absconded on the 17th and was away eighteen days without leave—he came back on Friday about half-past nine o clock—he was taken to the council and broke from being a mate—I was on duty when he was brought down by the police in a fly and was taken from the Infirmary to the strong-room for insanity by order of the assistant-surgeon who is not here Cross-examined Q Is the strong-room a place where they put persons who are disorderly and drunk A That is one but this was in the Infirmary—there is one for drunken and one for insane men—the prisoner was not drunk when he came down from London—I have not seen him tipsy—they do not let men get drunk at the hospital—I have not known them go away and have a frolic for two or three days—they are all helpless in my ward and cannot run away I cannot say about any other—I have been there three years COURT Q If men in the college get drunk have they not another dress put on them for a punishment A Yes it has yellow sleeves and a yellow waistcoat—the prisoner never wore it —M Kay I am master of St Saviour s Union Workhouse The prisoner was there three years previous to going to the College and he afterwards came frequently to visit the men but I saw nothing strange in his conduct till about the beginning of May—he called one evening between eight and nine o clock about the middle of May and asked if I would be kind enough to allow him to speak to a woman whom he named—I said it was rather late—he said he wanted to see her particularly as he wished to tell her something about her future husband—he said he was appointed captain in the Royal Navy and had a great deal of property coming to him—I did not believe that—I sent for the woman—she came and said Do you want me Dawson —he said Yes I am appointed captain in the Royal Navy and want a wife and know no one I should wish for more than yourself so put your things on and I will make you a lady —I said That will do Dawson you had better go home —my first impression was that he was the worse for liquor but I saw him several times after in the same state—I do not now think he was drunk but that he was not right in his mind—I would not allow him to take the woman away—he said Tell West to put her clothes on and come with me never mind what they say —on several occcasions after that I received small notes written on slips of dirty paper—I put them into the fire thinking them of no consequence—one of them said that West was to come to a certain place directly if she wished to see her husband alive Cross-examined Q How long did he stay the first time A Not above ten minutes I got rid of him as soon as I could—it was when he was going away that I thought he was not in liquor—I know his habits and never saw him the worse for liquor—my impression is that he was not drunk—I refused to let him come in when he came again—the daughter subpoenaed me here to-day—she came to me and told me if I saw him again to give him in charge of the police and a few days afterwards I saw him in custody—that was about the middle of May SIR JOHN LIDDELL I am a physician and medical-inspector of Greenwich Hospital Mr Littleton was the gentleman in attendance when the prisoner was brought down—I did not see him for four days after his arrival—he was then in the strong-room which would be appointed for a madman but it is a ward like the others—I questioned him repeatedly—he said his father had left him 500l —he said nothing about 40 000l —it would be very difficult for me to give an opinion whether the evidence given to-day indicates insanity upon some one point because the whole of it might have been produced by intemperance—if he was proved not to be intemperate then I should have a greater suspicion of insanity—I cannot discover any wounds on his head but they may have existed previously Cross-examined Q It was reported to you on the authority of the daughter that he was out of his mind A No she did not say so she said he behaved so wildly that she was afraid of him and had brought him down to me—I placed him in a part of the building which would give me facilities for watching him it is a case of daily occurrence in the hospital—I saw no indication of his having suffered from delirium tremens—it would not be apparent except when the paroxysms were on him—it is the result of protracted intemperance generally and from accidents—I had not known him before in the hospital—if he had had any attack of any kind he would have been brought to me—I discharged him from the Infirmary MR PAYNE Q Are persons insane sometimes on one topic and quite rational on all others A Yes if a person said he was a captain in the Navy and wanted to marry a pauper I should have great suspicion of his sanity but he might have some object in view—I am not able to say whether at his time of life delirium tremens might come on in consequence of previous intemperance which had been since abandoned—it generally results from intemperance that has been continued for a few days but I should not say above a week—when it has once got into insanity it would be liable to break out at times again—a man is always liable to its recurrence COURT Q Supposing he was deluded with the notion that he was made a captain when he was not would not that indicate that his mind was not right A It would—intemperance is a very common cause of incurable insanity—the receptacles for insane persons are half filled with persons who owe their condition to their intemperance and more especially as respects naval insanity—I think drinking porter and ale much more likely to cause it than spirits—if a man had led a drunken life up to three years ago that would not be likely to produce a want of health in the mind now if his health had been in a state of integrity up to that period GUILTY Aged 71 —Recommended to mercy by the Jury in consequence of the great length of time he had been in the service and his extreme age — Transported for Ten Years

t18501021-1728  1728 AUGUSTUS ROBINSON feloniously forging and uttering an order for payment of 20l with intent to defraud Charles Keyser MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution CHARLES KEYSER I am a stock-jobber On 30th July the prisoner was in my service—it was a part of his duty to keep a book as a check to the bankers pass-book—this is it produced and here is the bankers pass-book—it was his duty to fill up checks overnight previous to the settling-day for me to sign in the morning—it was his duty to get from Lubbock and Co my bankers a blank check-book when I wanted it—they were in the habit of returning cancelled checks every week—it was the prisoner s duty to fetch the passbook with the cancelled checks and to check them with the entries in my own duplicate pass-book and tick them off—on 30th July I am debited in the bankers pass-book with 20l which is not entered in the prisoner s book—that book is in his writing—the check appears to have been drawn on self—I drew no check in favour of self for 20l on 30th July—I never authorised the prisoner to draw sign or receive any such check—if any such check came to his hands either paid or otherwise it would be his duty to account for it in the book—I obtained these two 5l -notes produced horn my bankers somewhere in Sept —one has on it R H Cooper July 3lst 1850 Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q How many clerks do you keep A Only the prisoner—other clerks have not fetched cancelled checks for me from the bankers since the prisoner has been with me—I may have employed the clerk of a friend on the Stock Exchange to go to the bankers for me but if any clerk went to the bankers for me it would probably be at the prisoner s request—I draw a great many checks in the course of a day—I may have drawn fifty but that is not the average it is from ten to fifty—I draw them on a desk in the Change—each clerk has his seat—I may draw checks in a hurry—I never omitted to enter one for any time together—every single check which is drawn is dealt with by me afterwards and put to its proper account—I keep books myself and should find out whether I had entered it—I do not recollect ever omitting to enter one—the checks are written as fast as they can be and immediately handed over to me—my check-book is at the Stock Exchange—to the best of my recollection I have not signed blank checks since the prisoner has been with me which is two years—he could get a check-book whenever he thought it was wanted without any verbal or written order from me—the bankers had general authority to give it to him— I keep my check-book in a drawer in a desk in the Exchange—the prisoner had the key and would leave it in the drawer for me if he had to go away—there are about 800 persons in the Stock Exchange—I hare bad two checkbooks at a time I do no think I have had three—the prisoner had no authority to sign checks for me—he had to fill them up every day for me to sign—an entry is made in the margin at the time the check is drawn—the prisoner is seventeen or eighteen years old—his salary was 100l a year—he was recommended to me by Mr Ricardo who is a friend of his—there is great noise and confusion in the Exchange at times MR CLARKSON Q What would a check on self denote A That it was drawn for my own private expenses—the prisoner took the cheek-book home once a month but brought it back next morning—I keep the checks after I have examined them with my pass-book and destroy the counterfoils—if in the ordinary course of business I drew a check on self on 30th July I should have the check itself—I am sure I never drew one—I enter every check in a book which I keep myself THOMAS BRIGGS I am a clerk at Messrs Lubbock s There is a partner named Sir John William Lubbock Bart —there are others—Mr Keyaer keeps an account there—on 30th July I paid a check for 20l to the prisoner over the counter—I gave him two 5l notes 78407 and 78408 both dated 1st July and 10l in gold—this is one of the notes looking at it —it is the custom to return paid checks to the customer—it was the prisoner s custom to receive his master s pass-book each week with the paid checks Cross-examined Q Do yon hand cancelled checks back A Yes when the pass-book is asked for the checks are put into the pocket but not by me they pass through three or four hands before they are returned—they are entered in the pass-book by the juniors—no one but the prisoner ever received Mr Keyser s pass-book to my knowledge—I do not always hand it back there are four cashiers I am one—when check-books are asked for I generally give them without any order in writing—I take no signature from the parties for them—if any one beside the prisoner asked me for a cheek-book for Mr Keyer I should not give it to them not even if I knew him to be the clerk of a person on the Stock Exchange unless he brought an order—the entry is 20l paid clerk —I am certain I paid it to the prisoner but have no recollection of it independent of the entry in the book COURT Q When checks are paid over the counter what is done with them A They are placed on a file and the pass-book is made up from them they are then placed behind cards in a box with the name of each customer and three or four days afterwards are taken out—when the book is wanted the ledger-keeper takes the checks from behind the cards and compares them with the ledger they are then placed in the book sideways not in the pocket but for the junior clerk to write them off on the debit side place the checks in the pocket and give them to the ledger-keeper to compare the book with the ledger—after the ledger-keeper has compared the book he places it in a drawer for the cashier to give up when it is inquired for JOHN FARRELL I am junior clerk at Lubbock s On 30th July I find in this pass-book Self 20l in my writing—I made that entry from the check itself and then put it into the pocket of the pass-book Cross-examined Q Have you any recollection of the matter except from seeing your writing there A No—1 find the check placed in the book with others—the person who places it there gets it from the voucher-box—it has already been entered in the ledger before it comes to me—after I have made the entries I put the checks into the pocket and it goes back to the ledger-clerk to see whether it corresponds with the ledger—it it then put into the drawer for the cashier to deliver up MR CLARKSON Q Has the ledger-clerk anything to do beyond examining your entry with the pass-book or has he anything to do with the check at all A Not unless I enter it wrong—it would remain in the pocket till the customer sends for it EDWARD CRUTTAELL STRINGER I am a clerk hi the house of Heron and Co wholesale druggists 95 Bishopsgate-street Mr Robert Hawkins Cooper a chemist was a customer of ours in July last This 5l note has on it my writing R H Cooper July 31 —I received 20l from him on that day of which this note formed a part—the firm have no other customer of that name Cross-examined Q Are you positive about that note A I have no doubt about it ROBERT HAWKINS COOPER I am a chemist of 20 Royal Exchange On 31st July I owed Heron and Co 20l I paid them that day—the prisoner was a customer of mine and owed me 2l 1s —he paid me on the same day and I believe this must be the 5l -note he gave me—I handed it to Mr Stringer—I had no recollection of the manner in which I was paid when first asked Cross-examined Q Did not you say you thought yon were paid in gold A I did rather incline to that opinion at that time but at Guildhall I said I thought it must have been a 5l -note and when Mr Keyser told me he had traced it to me I had no doubt of it—I said two or three times I thought he paid me in gold—I said I had no recollection of receiving a 5l -note from him—I knew him by a different name because I was treating him for a delicate matter—it was two or three weeks afterwards I saw Mr Keyser—I said I had no recollection of whom he was speaking—a gentleman did call on me and say Tell me the honest truth was it gold or not —and I said I believe it was gold —if the note had not been so clearly traced to me 1 should still say he paid me in gold CHARLES PILL I am one of the clerks in Messrs Lubbock s house I know the prisoner as Mr Keyser s clerk On 9th July I delivered him a blank check-book—I have a memorandum of it in my own writing July 9th No 33—150 checks Charles Keyser —this is the check-book produced 110 of them are gone counterfoils and all only forty remain CHARLES KEYSER re-examined I never destroy the counterfoils while the check-book is in use JOHN WALTER HINLEY I live at 42 Hernmingford-terrace Islington The prisoner lodged with me in July and afterwards—a policeman came in Sept and searched the prisoner s lodgings—I saw him examine a dressingcase which was brought up from the prisoner s sister s room—he produced a key and unlocked it—I saw him find a check-book in it ROBERT TAYLOR City-policeman 144 On 31st Aug I took the prisoner—I got some keys from him at the station and on 6th Sept went to Mr Henley s and opened a dressing-case with one of them and under a secret bottom which was let in and which I had great difficulty in getting out I found the check-book produced—as I took him from Guildhall to the Compter that day he said I believe you are going to search my lodgings —I said How do you know that did you hear the Magistrate tell me —he said Yes don t let my sister go up with you into the room —I said Are you afraid 1 shall find any checks there or Have you any checks there I forget which—he hesitated a moment and then said I had a check but I think I destroyed it —I found on him no check for 20l of 31st July Cross-examined Q This is the first time you have mentioned that conversation A Yes the Magistrate remanded the case for the purpose of the prisoner s lodging being searched—the Magistrate called me on one side and asked me if I had searched it not loud enough as I thought for the prisoner to hear—the prisoner said Don t let my sister go up into my bed-room —there were some medicine bottles there WILLIAM HENRY POLLARD I am one of the clerks to Mr Hobler the attorney for the prosecution On 18th Sept during the last Sessions I served on the prisoner in Newgate a notice and on 22nd Oct during this Sessions I served him with another a copy of the former—this is a copy produced Cross-examined Q Did you serve the notice last Session personally A Yes but the one this Session I gave to the turnkey at the door These being read were notices to produce upon the trial a check for 20l dated 30th July 1850 and all other documents in his possession relating to the case MR PARRY submitted that the notices were bad the first as it did not call on the prisoner to produce anything at the present Session and the second because not served personally on him but left at the gaol while he was a prisoner and therefore unable to take any steps towards its production further he urged that secondary evidence could not be given of the contents of the check it not being clearly traced to his possession which it ought to be before he could be expected to obey a notice to produce it MR JUSTICE ERLE was of opinion that the objections must fail the evidence supported the fact that in the regular course of business the check would come into the prisoner s possession and the notice served on the prisoner in gaol entitled the prosecutor in the absence of the document to give secondary evidence of its contents for although the prisoner was not a free agent he had the means of communicating with his legal adviser and through him obtaining it a notice was as binding upon a prisoner as it would be if served on a party bed-ridden or incapable of moving MR CLARKSON to MR KEYSER Q What was the signature to the check to the best of your recollection A C Keyser MR PARRY Q And it was paid by you with the belief that it was drawn by Mr Keyser A Yes GUILTY of Uttering

of Austria MR SOLICITOR GENERAL MR BODKIN and MR HUDDLESTON conducted the Prosecution LAURENCE LEE I am a lithographer and engraver at 245 High Hol-born the business is partly mine and partly my father s On Monday 2nd Sept the prisoner came to our house—he spoke to me in English—he showed me one of these notes and asked me what I would do 3 000 of them for—this produced is one that he produced to me—I replied that they would be 2l 15s and then observing a water-mark I asked if he wished to have that done—he said Yes —I said that would be 10s more—they were to be lithographed and to be an exact copy—when I said it would cost 10s more he said he did not care much about that if we would do them at a reasonable price he did not want to bate us down but he wanted them done as reasonably as possible—there are two impressions on the note made with dies the prisoner asked me what we would engrave those two stamps for—I said I would tell him next time he called—I told him I should require a deposit—he said he was not prepared then but he would call next morning with it—I am not certain whether the first time he came he explained the nature of the notes but he did either the first or second time—he came next day and gave me a sovereign—he then said it was a ticket by which miners or labourers could get anything they wished in the shape of provisions or clothing and that they were paid by the proprietors of the land—I do not understand the Italian language—he asked when he could see a proof of them—I said in two or three days—he did not give me any name he said he lived in Brook-street that is near our house—he mentioned the house in Brook-street but I forget it—when he came the second time I told him the dies would be a sovereign each—he seemed to think it rather high and said he would see himself about it—I told him he would probably find somebody in Clerkenwell that would do it for him—I began the work—during the progress of it the prisoner called almost every day during the week he saw it in progress and seemed very well satisfied as far as we had gone he repeated the injunction which he gave us first to do them well—I communicated with my father on the subject on 3rd Sept the morning after the prisoner came— after he had called several times and seen the work in progress he produced to me this other note looking at one for 60-lire —I believe that was on the Thursday I am not exactly certain of the day it was about a week after he first came—I had previously shown him a proof of the 5-lire note as far as it had gone—when he produced this 60-lire note he asked what would be the price for 1 000 of them printed back and front—I said they would be 5l 10s with the water-mark—he agreed to give that—he did not give any description of that note to me—I did not require a further deposit on that new order he gave me another sovereign on the old one—he afterwards called to see a perfect proof of the first note—that was on Tuesday the 10th he examined it and said it would do very nicely—he wished me to get on with the other as fast as possible as he was going out of town on the Sunday—I understood him to say he was going to Birmingham but I am not very certain about that it was promised on the Saturday—I have not got the proof I showed him of the first note—this produced is a proof of part of the second note that I showed him—he expressed himself satisfied as far as it had gone and wished it finished and he would come on the Sunday to see a proof as he had to go out of town this is a finished proof—it is a proof from a lithographic stone which I made in pursuance of his directions—I promised that the 3 000 of the first notes should be done on Thursday—he said be would call but he did not—he came on the Saturday about eleven o clock in the morning—he said he had called for the labels which he had ordered—I do not know whether he used the term labels or tickets but I rather think it was labels as he had called them labels before—I said they were ready and I would fetch them—I went up stairs and brought down a packet containing the 3 000 of the first notes and delivered them to the prisoner—he opened the parcel and examined the notes—he said some of them were a little pale—he paid me a balance of 1l 5s he had paid me 2l before—he took away the 3 000 notes with him in the packet I had given him—before he left he saw a proof of the 60-lire note he had seen it before partly finished—he expressed himself satisfied and said he would call the next day—at that time I was aware that Forrester the officer was in waiting in the neighbourhood—I believe my father had been in communication with Forrester on Tuesday 3rd Sept Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When did you first see Forrester A I do not think I saw him till the day the prisoner was taken or the day before—I did not myself see any one on the subject of this engraving except the prisoner—I gave it into my father s hands and he saw about it himself—nobody had come to our place of business on the subject of what we were doing at any time before 2nd Sept —the first intimation of any desire to engrave or make any ticket or label I received on 2nd Sept —nobody that I am aware of had been at our house before that—nobody came I think for about a week when some person came to see the prisoner some one connected with the officers it might have been a week or ten days—I believe it was Mr Goddard—nobody else came that I recollect—I believe Goddard did not see the prisoner at that time but he saw him afterwards—I was not at home then—the first intimation I received on the subject of any engraving of this kind was on 2nd Sept and the prisoner was the first person I saw—I saw no foreign gentleman nor any one else—I have never seen any foreign gentleman about it MR SOLICITOR-GENERAL Q What did Goddard come for A The first time he came to identify the prisoner if he saw him GEORGE LAURENCE LEE I am the father of the last witness and carry on business with him as a lithographer and engraver at 245 High Holborn—my son made a communication to me with respect to a note of this description looking at the five-lire note —that was some time on Tuesday 3rd Sept —he showed me this note and left it with me—I made some inquiries and afterwards got an Italian dictionary—I do not understand Italian—I made use of the dictionary and translated it—I afterwards put myself in communication with Forrester I saw him at the Mansion-house—I first saw the prisoner about the Thursday or Friday the 5th or 6th at our house—I then had a proof of this five-lire note I showed it to him he said it would do very well—I understood him to say at that time that it was a miner s ticket and that it was given in lieu of money for provisions or clothing—one of the impressions was lying in the shop-window—he said he did not wish it exposed that some of his countrymen might come in and notice them—I saw him again one day in the beginning of the next week—at that time he brought the sixty-lire note and gave it me to do I was to lithograph it—he said it was to be exactly like this—I am not aware how many he ordered—my son was present—the prisoner subsequently said they were lottery-tickets—he said he did not wish them to be seen—he said he would be a good customer if I did this to time—a lithograph of this was made in my establishment Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You say you saw Forrester at the Mansion-house A Yes I had not seen him previously I am quite sure about that or any one from him—I had had no communication from him of any kind—I went there of my own accord—it was not Forrester who found me out I am certain of that—I found Forrester out not Forrester me—I made the first communication on this subject to the officer—I had received no communication from anybody previously—no inquiry was made of me—I never had a matter of this kind to do before—I lithograph documents of this kind COURT Q Is the water-mark you speak of the waving line on the pink ground A No if you hold it up you will see it—I do not wish to tell how it is done—it is not exactly in the line of a lithographer—this is the original he gave me—that has a real water-mark the other is not a real one JOHN FORRESTER I am a police-officer of the City of London I received a communication from Mr Lee I think on 4th Sept —he came to the Mansion-house to me and made a communication to me and that communication I made to Mr Bush—I employed Goddard—he went with me on the morning of the 14th—I was not aware of his going to Mr Lee s in the interval—he went with me on the morning of the 14th and we saw the prisoner a little before ten o clock—he went into Mr Lee s house and stopped there I think about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—he then came out with this parcel—I followed him down Holborn into Warwick-court and then took him into custody and took the parcel from him—I took him to Bow-street station—when I got him there I undid the parcel before him and told him that they appeared like the parts of an Austrian note—he said that all he knew was that a gentleman in France had given him an order to get these things done and he supposed them to be lottery-tickets—that was all that passed between us—I afterwards went to his house—he gave his address at the station—it was 13 Little Brook-street Holborn the George public-house—I went there and in his room I found this passport produced and other papers—there are two or three letters addressed to him by his name—I also found two more of these Austrian notes— These were stated to be genuine notes of sixteen and thirty lire Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q I understand from your evidence that the first intimation on this subject that came to your knowledge was at the Mansion-house A Yes from the elder Mr Lee I think that was on 4th Sept —I had no knowledge that anything of this sort was in progress before Mr Lee called on me—the communication I received was from Mr Lee the elder—it was not a communication made to the Magistrate at the Mansion-house it was a private communication to me—I knew Mr Lee before—the first time I knew him was I think two years ago—I had never put him in motion or he me on the subject matter of such a transaction as this before I saw him on 4th Sept —I became acquainted with him by some persons who were convicted here going to his house to buy some stones for printing notes—that was in a Russian ease and he was a witness in the ease—I think it was about two years ago it was the case of Friedeburgh I think—Mr Lee had not given any information on that occasion I think the information went to Mr Peachey—I think Lee was the person that made the communication—I did not take any advice of any of the authorities at the Mansion-house before I proceeded to Mr Bush—I went to Leadbetter first—he has something to do with the Austrian Government and the Commissioners were over here—we talked the case over and we went to Mr Bush together—part of the gentlemen who are here now were in this country at that time—I cannot tell how long they had been here—I only knew of their being here a day or two before 2nd Sept —I had not seen anything of Mr Bush on the subject before 4th Sept nor had Leadbetter that I am aware of—Leadbetter knew nothing of it till I acquainted him of it—I had not seen the Commissioners before 2nd Sept I understood they were at Birmingham on a case there—I did not go to the Austrian Consul it strikes me that somebody else went I forget now—I went to Mr Bush because these gentlemen came and wished to have advice about it and that was the reason I went to Mr Bush with them—I did not have any communication with Mr Bush until I had seen the Commissioners—I went to Mr Bush the next morning after receiving the communication from Mr Lee—I think Mr Bush was the first person I saw after I had seen Mr Lee—if you will allow me I think I can now recollect—there was a person of the name of Netherclift who came to Mr Bush to give some information about some man—I only know that because when I went there I saw Mr Netherclift he is an engraver—I never saw anybody on the subject of this transaction until 1 saw Mr Lee and then I directly went to Mr Bush Q I want to know as at that time you had seen nobody and knew nothing of the transaction why you went to Mr Bush A Because Mr Netherclift had been to Mr Bush the day before—Mr Bush sent to me to tell me about Netherclift and then I stated to Mr Bush that there was another man of the name Lee giving the same information—I had the message from Mr Bush the day before I saw Mr Lee Q If you had had a communication with Mr Bush before how do you reconcile that with your seeing Mr Bush for the first time after you had seen Mr Lee the elder A I saw Mr Bush but not on Mr Lee s information at all—Mr Bush sent for me because Netherclift had come to give some information on the same sort of thing and when I went the next day I said that Mr Lee had been—I think it was on the 3rd I was sent for to Mr Bush—I said I knew that the Commissioners were then in London—I think it was 2nd Sept —I had not seen Mr Bush before I knew that the Commissioners were here Q What I want to know is how it happened that Mr Bush had anything to do with the matter A Because when Leadbetter came we thought we would advise with him and he was recommended to the case—when Leadbetter came to me we thought we would advise with the Commissioners and recommend Mr Bush to the case—Mr Bush has these sort of cases and understands them and I thought he was a very proper person to advise with—I had no particular reason for going to Mr Bush without communicating with my superiors—what I did was for the best—I and Leadbetter and the Commissioners all went together to Mr Bush to advise with him—I did not see the Commissioners before I went to Mr Bush—the first time I saw them was on the 5th I think about two o clock—they came to the Mansion-house and then from there to Mr Bush s—I expected to see them at the Mansion-house through Leadbetter—I think I saw Mr Bush before I saw the Commissioners I have not a doubt about it—it was through Nether-clift the thing was mentioned—I went to Mr Bush the day after Mr Lee made the communication to me I do not know what time of the day I went I think it was in the morning about twelve o clock—I did not employ Mr Bush at that lime—I went to Mr Bush because he sent to me because Netherclift had given him the information and when he had told me that and Lee gave me the information I went and told him of the circumstance—I had no communication with any person whatever on the subject of this transaction until Mr Lee came to me and made a private communication to me at the Mansion-house—I did not have any communication with anybody else until I saw Mr Bush—it was on the 4th that I had a communication from Mr Bush not on this subject—it was perhaps five o clock it might be four I am not sure—I had seen Mr Lee about twelve in the morning—when I saw Mr Bush at four or five it was at his own office—I had not had any communication with him before that about any subject of this kind—I went to Mr Bush because he sent to me when Netherelift was there COURT Q As I understand Mr Bush had something told him by Mr Netherclift that had something to do with something like this and then Mr Bush sent to you A Yes—in the meantime I had seen Mr Lee the elder and when Mr Bush told me what Mr Netherclift had told him I said that Mr Lee had been to me about the same thing MR CLARKSON Q Just let me understand you once more had you had any communication with either Mr Bush or Mr Netherclift until after you had seen Mr Lee the elder A No I had not—I did not know there was anything of this description with reference to the prisoner or any other man until I saw Mr Lee—I went to Mr Bush in consequence of a message I swear that it was a message on the subject of the person who went to give him the information Q You told me a while ago that you and Leadbetter had agreed to recommend Mr Bush is that so A I do not know about recommending—we took him because he is a person understanding this particular affair or things of this sort and the Commissioners I and Leadbetter went over together to consult him—we went over as much as anything because we knew that Mr Bush knew that Netherclift had been giving some information—it was afterwards that I went with the Commissioners—I went to Mr Bush in consequence of the message I received it was not about Mr Lee—I cannot tell who brought me the message—I did not say just now that I went to Mr Bush of my own accord I do not think I said such a thing—I am positive I went to him because he sent for me in consequence of Mr Netherclift being there MR SOLICITOR-GENERAL Q You have been asked about these Commissioners what were they here for do you know A They were here as I understand about a case they were prosecuting at Birmingham—I never saw them on that account but I knew that Leadbetter had to do with the Austrian Government and I sent to him to come to me directly and when I knew the Commissioners were here I thought they were proper persons to advise with JOHN BUSH asq I am a member of the firm of Bush and Mullens we are conducting this prosecution On Monday 2nd Sept I received a communication from a person named Netherclift it had reference to the 5-lire note on the table—I immediately took that note and communicated with Messrs Rothschild and Co who are the bankers of the Austrian Government—they referred me to the Baron Kohler the Austrian charge d affairs and I went to him immediately—I received an appointment to see the Baron Kohler next day—in the interval Forrester came to me and showed me a similar note different from that which I held—I had sent to Forrester on the Monday evening to say that I wished to see him—he came next day and brought Lee senior with him—he brought with him another note for 5-lire similar to that which Netherclift gave me the day before—I saw the Baron Kohler next day and received directly from him my first instructions to communicate with Mr Develthensal the Commissioner on this case from whom I have since received all instructions—Mr Develthensal is one of the twenty-four principal Commissioners of Police for the Austrian Empire and he is now in Court—he was here I believe on a prosecution at Birmingham JAMES SHEPHERD I keep the George public-house in Brook-street Holborn I know the prisoner he was lodging at my house at the time he was taken into custody for this offence—he came there on Sunday Sept 1st—I had known him before for twenty years—I knew him in business in Edinburgh as a glass barometer and thermometer-maker—I knew him there till I left fifteen years ago—he was in business there five six or seven years to my knowledge—I did not know him in business anywhere else—I had not seen him in London till Sept 1st—I always understood him to be an Italian but I have no knowledge—I always beard he was an Italian—I hare not heard him say what countryman he was—I did not know him in business in London—I have only lived in Brook-street six months—I recollect Forrester coming to my house I pointed out to him the room in which the prisoner lodged CHARLES GALLIEA I am a barometer-maker and live at 68 Hatton-garden I have known the prisoner about twenty-five years he is an Italian—I know he can read writing and printing but he is not much of a writer—I do not know that he speaks very good English I have heard him speak English—I knew him when he was in business in London—he was in business in Edinburgh and he was in partnership with others in London—I knew him in business in London up to about ten years ago—he has been away from England since he gave up business Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How do you know he is an Italian A He calls himself an Italian—he says he was born close in the neighbourhood of Como—he has not told me so but we all know he was born at such a village—I cannot tell you how I know it—he has never told me that he was an Italian nor where he was born but I know the place where he was born MR SOLICITOR-GENERAL Q Have you ever heard him talk Italian A Yes his language is not Italian it is the patois of Lombard he talks that language like others coming from that part GUISEPPE GUATZAROLI I am a looking-glass manufacturer at 106 Hatton-garden I have known the prisoner nearly twenty-five years—I know him to be an Italian because I know the village where he comes from it is Copiango near Como—I have had conversations with him in Italian Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q During that time I suppose you have known nothing against him A No I do not know how long ago it is since he first came to England I think he was in England before me—I came in 1826—he was then at Manchester—I do not know anything about these notes in Lombardy—I was in Italy last March and there is this money there—it is two years ago since they began to introduce these notes since 1848 I believe—there is an objection to taking them because I think we can go into the market and buy them for twenty centisimo less—the Government themselves object to take them and if they receive them for taxes you must have half in notes and some persons will not take them—there is a great objection to them among the peasantry because they are not acquainted with them—they will take them but I think they would prefer money MR SOLICITOR-GENERAL Q But do they circulate A I believe so—I cannot say much about it because I was not there long—I did not take any of them PAUL PRETSCH through an interpreter I am the appointed overseer of the Royal Printing Office at Vienna which is under the direction of the Imperial Minister of Finance Baron Grousse—the two notes produced are genuine—they have been printed at the institution to which I belong—these others are not genuine—Montecuccoli whose signature is to the genuine notes is the Plenipotentiary of his Imperial Majesty in Italy—his Majesty s Christian names are Francis Joseph Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Is there any writing of Montecuccoli s on any of the notes A None it is all printed—the signature is printed at the same time with the other part at the Imperial Printing Office at Vienna GUISEFPE TSCHEIRTSCHER through an interpreter I am General Paymaster in the Lombardo Venetian Provinces of Austria His Majesty s title there is King of the Lombardo Venetian Provinces—it is called The Lonbardo Venetian Kingdom —it belongs to my functions to issue the paper money of Austria in that country—I receive these notes from the centre administration or treasury at Vienna in order to distribute them afterwards to the other branch treasuries under my direction—it is my duty to know whether notes are genuine or not—these two notes for 5 and 60-lire are perfectly genuine—I receive them so from Vienna with the signature of Montecuccoli printed on them—these others are false—the genuine notes are received as ready money not only by the treasuries but among the public generally—they are received according to their nominal value without reduction—if 5 they are received as five if 60 they are received as sixty—every one is bound to receive these notes instead of the Convention currency or coin—the 60-lire note carries interest with it—the party bringing this note when it is due receives so much interest on it which is marked on it in coin—the 5-lire notes are the lowest of all—these two stamps which are on the note are printed at the same time at Vienna—the smaller note has a Vienna stamp and the large one a Vienna stamp and likewise a control stamp affixed in Milan by the Imperial Stamp Office in order to avoid falsification and to be a sort of evidence and to prevent a greater number being put into circulation than is appointed by the Government—there is such a coin as a lire circulating in that country each lire contains 100 centissimos Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q By what law is it that the people of the Lombardo Venetian Kingdom are bound to take these notes A By the proclamation of the Emperor issued in March 1849—the interest on a 60-lire note is paid in coin WILLIAM FREDERICK BEKEM I am a translator I have made a translation of this 5-lire note— read— 1st April 1849 A Lombardo Venetian Kingdom—5—Treasury note Five Austrian Lire The present note of 5-lire is taken in payment as hard cash at the central treasuries and at all the public treasuries of the Lombardo Venetian Kingdom The Imperial Commissary Plenipotentiary Montecuceoli —the 60-lire note is Como—Number 113 496—1st April 1849—D—Lombardo Venetian Kingdom—60—Treasury note—Sixty Austrian Lire The present note of 60-lire and the amount of the interest due thereon at the rate of the indication on the back hereof are taken in payment as hard cash at the central treasuries and at all the public treasuries of the Lombardo Venetian Kingdom At the expiration of one year the interest will be paid in cash at the central treasuries against the issue of a fresh note Imperial Commissary Plenipotentiary Montecuceoli —at the back there is a calculation—the words are a beading to a sort of table on the amount of 60-lire— Interest will be paid reckoning from 1st April 1849 at the rate of 1 centessimo for every two days—on the following table is specified the complete amount due as stated —I believe these the forgeries to be to the same effect as the others except that she 60-lire note has nothing at the back GUILTY Aged 48 — Transported for Seven Years

this 14s 7d was put by the clerk—I did not pay the prisoner under the impression that he was Halliwell—it is customary to pay the time-keeper for those persons who are discharged—it was not my duty to pay the men themselves—the timekeeper presents these orders more often than the men—I bad very few orders of this kind about that time—this was not discovered to be forged for some days it was not so long as a week or ten days—the prisoner was the only time-keeper for the carpenters—when he was away Mr Cole was his successor he is there still—there might be twenty or twenty-five other time-keepers—I paid another order the same day which was another case of this kind—this signature is very much like Mr Lovell s writing MR BODKIN Q IS this paper your writing A Yes part of it I make these memorandums at the time I make the payments—fourteen or fifteen men might have been paid off that day—I have no doubt the prisoner is the person to whom I paid this 14s 7d —the check-clerk was present—if this had been handed to me without the initials I should have said Take it to the check-clerk —I am quite sure the prisoner did not bring in another man to receive the money HENRY SWEETAFPLE OLDEN I am a clerk in the cashier s office it if my duty when an order is brought in for payment to see that the sum demanded is accurate On 2nd Jan the prisoner handed this paper to me for payment—I checked the accuracy of the calculation—the sum of money on it was 14s —I found the party was entitled to 7d more—I made the alteration put my initials to it handed it to the prisoner and he presented it for payment to Mr Hall—Mr Hall called my attention to the signature being Mr Lovell s—I was busy at the time—I did not look into it minutely—I said Yes I believed it was Mi Lovell s —the prisoner was there—I believe he was near enough to hear it Cross-examined Q Did you notice to whom Mr Hall paid the money A No I do not recollect that another man was brought in EDWARD LOVELL I am in the employ of Messrs Fox and Henderson as foreman of the carpenters The prisoner was employed under me as time-keeper from 18th Nov till 27th Dec —I had not discharged him but I never saw him after—he was paid 3s a day—if a man was discharged he would get his wages by an order like this with my signature to it—a man named Halliwell had been in the employ a month to the best of my recollection—the prisoner would know that—this order speaks of four days and five hours work and being on 2nd Jan would be subsequent to 27th Dec when the prisoner ceased to attend—Halliwell has never quitted the employ he is at work for me now—the 2nd Jan was on Thursday—the time-sheet had been last sent in on 27th Dec by the prisoner—the name of Lovell is not my signature nor written by my authority or knowledge—I have seen the prisoner write and believe the body of this order to be his writing—I do not know whether he has seen me write he has seen my signature in my books—I allowed him to sign John Watson for Edward Lovell Cross-examined Q How many papers of this sort did you write on Thursday 2nd Jan A None I did not write one that week I had no man left that week—I have not the control of the sawyers only to order what wood is wanted to be cut—it is very seldom that I write an order of this sort—I generally go down to the office take the time-book and give the man s time in and let the man receive the money—I never receive it—I acted as time-keeper that week myself it being Christmas week—I had about fifty carpenters and twenty-three labourers—I do not know that they have opportunity of seeing me write from time to time—the men do not see me write in the book when I put down their wages they have no check upon me it is supposed that the work is put down right—I have been employed on the works ever since Oct —I know the prisoner was not there that week I considered he was ill WILLIAM HALLIWELL I live in Smith-street Chelsea and am a carpenter I have been employed at the building in the Park about eight weeks and am working there still—I have never left the employ from the time I began—I know the prisoner and he knows me by my working under him he was time-keeper and took down my time weekly—I was paid at the end of the week regularly with the exception of Saturday night 4th Jan —I went as usual for my week s pay and was to receive 19s 6d —I did not get the money some inquiry was made and on Monday morning they paid me—I had lost half a day that week and they paid me 17s 10d not 19s 6d —I have been paid regularly ever since——I know nothing about this paper—I never saw it till I was before the Magistrate Cross-examined Q Used you to account for your work to anybody A No but I used to give in a ticket at morning and at dinner-time to show that I was there—the dinner ticket proved that I was there after dinner—I always gave in my own ticket—there was one half-day the prisoner offered to give in my ticket for me to represent that I was there when I was not—I was not found fault with about it afterwards—that was the only occasion—I was absent that half day—I used to go to receive my own money on Saturday night MR BODKIN Q What passed about this ticket A I told the prisoner I was going to lose half-a-day on the following day and be told me he would square it for me—I never asked him to get an order for the payment of my wages in the week JAMES BROWN DOUGHTY policeman T 269 I produce a certificate of the prisoner s conviction at this Court— read—Convicted August 1849 Confined one year —he is the man GUILTY Aged 22 — Transported for Seven Years

t18510203-541  541 WILLIAM DANIELS feloniously forging and littering a receipt for 5l with intent to defraud Thomas Fuller MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution THOMAS FULLER I am a sharebroker I had a partner but have not now—I had no partner on 12th Dec —on 10th Dec I received this letter looking at it —in answer to it I wrote so much of this letter looking at another as is subscribed Fuller and Co —in reply to that I received this other letter looking at it —in consequence of that I went on 12th Dec to the Old Bell in Holborn—I saw Mr Bunyer the landlord and tendered him a check for 50l —he refused to take it—I returned to my office and sent my clerk Charles Grinter with 50l in cash in return for that he brought me this document looking at it —I did not receive this letter of my own with the receipt subscribed as it is now—I never received it directly from the landlord myself—I believe one of the officers received it—it was left in the hand of Mr Bunyer—I believe I saw it two or three days afterwards—the assignment and transfer I sold to a mining sharebroker—it afterwards turned out a forgery—I replaced a genuine share at the time so that by these means I have lost 50l —there was a duplicate of the paper—they were both handed to Mr Jones Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT JONES Q When did you last have a partner A I think it was last Oct —it was some time after that we got the dissolution advertized—I had no partner in Dec —I carry on business in the name of Fuller and Co —there is no one but myself CHARLES GRINTER I am clerk to Mr Fuller On 12th Dec I took 50l to the Old Bell in Holborn—I gave it to Mr Bunyer s daughter in his presence—she wrote this memorandum by her father s desire and handed it to me—I took it back to Mr Fuller and gave it him and also this other paper which I received from her WILLIAM BUNYER I am the landlord of the Old Bell Holborn The prisoner came to my house early in Dec —he left his address William Davey Boaxe if any letters came for him—on 12th Dec two papers similar to these were handed to me by the prisoner—he said he was to receive 50l for them—this acknowledgment at the foot of this letter was written in my presence by the prisoner—I saw Mr Fuller afterwards I think it must have been four or five days afterwards—some gentlemen came together—I afterwards received 50l from Grinter—I desired my daughter to write the memorandum and I saw her write it—I delivered to Grinter a paper similar to this to take to his master—on the same evening I saw the prisoner or the evening afterwards I paid the 50l into his hands and he wrote the receipt on this letter looking at it in my presence Cross-examined Q Am I to understand that you first saw the prisoner in the early part of Dec A Yes I think I might see him for a week after he first came—he did not stay at my house he called—I cannot say that I saw him every day—I saw him three times or more—I have not the least doubt he is the man WILLIAM DAVEY BOAXE I am a solicitor and live at Liskard in Cornwall I at one time possessed a share in the Wheal Mary Anne Mine—I had it from the prisoner—I had disposed of that share I think two years before last Dec —I am acquainted with the character of the prisoner s writing—this letter dated 10th Dec purporting to come from a Mr Boaxe is not my writing I believe it is the prisoner s writing I did not authorize him to write it in my name—it is offering the share for sale—this second letter agreeing to accept the 50l is the same writing it is not mine—I did not authorize the prisoner to take 50l for a share—I was not at that time the owner of a share—this transfer bears the signature of William Davey Boaxe—it is not my writing—I did not authorize the prisoner or any one to sign it—it is an imitation of my writing—I cannot say whose it is—the body of this assignment is like the prisoner s writing—I believe this other letter and this receipt to be the prisoner s writing Cross-examined Q Do you know the prisoner s writing well A Yes I have seen him write three or four times in the course of seven or eight years—I have seen him sign his name and write various matters—his name is not to any of these documents—I employed him to write a valuation of a share as a broker which he called himself—I saw him write it and I saw what he had written—I have not the slightest doubt about this being his writing—I have known him eight or nine yean in Cornwall never out of it—he was at one time the purser of a mine the man who receives the money and keeps accounts—I had rather not say anything respecting his character—I have had business transactions with him some time ago—I lent him 120l four or five years ago—I think he repaid roe 35l in money—he also transferred the share that I have spoken of as a further reduction of the debt—I had to pay a call of 23l due on it in which he deceived me—he did not make over to me a claim he had on the Plymouth and North Cornwall Railway for 180l nor a claim on the North Cornwall for 132l —he gave me a power of attorney to see the parties for those sums of money—I was to repay myself and make over an account—he owes me more money I believe—some proceedings have been taken In those matters—if the two sums were paid the balance due to the prisoner would depend on the amount of costs—I think it was in Oct or Nov he gave me the power of attorney—I did not tell him on receiving it the shares should be his again and he might do what he liked with them nothing of the kind—I had no share in my possession at that time—I have not had any share in a mine for two years—I have not received either of these sums—I have not taken proceedings to recover them—my agent was employed in the matter—I do not think he has received anything CHARLES THOMAS GAYLOR City policeman 346 I took the prisoner on 3rd Jan at 18 Little Knight Rider-street Doctors -commons —I told him the charge—he said be knew nothing about it and he was not in town at the time—Mr Dennett another broker who was with me told him the time—after his committal I took him to Newgate—going along he said as it regarded Mr Kitto s affair he knew nothing about it and previous to this transaction he had not bad a stain against his character and that he went to one of our men to give himself up as he could not leave the country till he had made it known to Mr Boaxe Cross-examined Q Was any one else present A No I told Mr Fuller of this a few days ago Letters read — 10th Dec To Mr Fuller Sir —I am the holder of a share in the Mary Ann Mine in the parish of Liskard in Cornwall with which I presume you are acquainted which I am disposed to part with my interest in I will thank you to sell 105th share for me if possible to-morrow the cash being wanted immediately Please send me word if you can conclude the affair with me If you require a reference I am well known to some of the brokers indeed I believe to most of them from my having been purser of the Haresfoot Mine near Liskard I presume you will be able to get 50l or guineas for it W D BOAXE — Dec 11th 1850 Sir —Yours duly came to hand and in reply beg to state we will give you 50l for one share in the Wheal Mary Ann Mine and will dispose of it according to your instruction An answer will oblige — Dec 11th 1850 To Messrs Fuller and Co Gentlemen —I regret that I was out when your letter

Prosecution JAMES THOMAS EDWARDS I am a wine-merchant in Harp-lane Tower-street In Feb last I had a part of my house to let in offices—the prisoner came to look at them—he gave the name of R H or R M Holmes—he did not put any name up—I did not enter into any agreement with him—he had a paper put up in my office All letters addressed to R M Holmes and Co to be left with Mr Edwards —we had frequent conversation in the course of his coming to and fro as regards business and he said that he was about to open a sherry house that he had a great deal of property coming to his wife and that his uncle was connected with Spain that he should only ship sherries and he wished me to supply his customers with other articles—that was the agreement we were about to enter into and he was to receive a commission upon them—on 22nd Feb he said to me I was at Woolwich yesterday calling on my different customers and among others Mr Richards of the Castle Inn Woolwich do you know Mr Richards —I said Yes —he said Richards was a purchaser and asked me to let him have samples to show to Mr Richards—I let him have the samples—next day he said that he had sold Mr Richards a pipe of the port and a hogshead of the sherry and wished me to take out the warrants—I did so these are the warrants produced —I endorsed them to Mr Richards—I at the same time gave him this invoice— read—This was made out—Mr W J Richards to J T Edwards dated Feb 22 —the wine was standing at the Docks in my name and would not be delivered without these warrants—they are the same as bank-notes—the prisoner told me that Mr Richards usually paid cash but he was a little uncertain whether he would but if not he would give a bill at three months—I told him I had no objection to that as it was a matter of doubt whether Mr Richards would pay cash or give a bill he requested me to give him a blank stamp—I gave him 3s 6d stamp—I saw him again the next day or the day after and on my asking him if he had seen Mr Richards he said he had been to Woolwich that Mr Richards was not at home and he had left the warrants making an appointment to call the following day to receive the money or take a bill—I saw him again on the 27th or 28th—he then gave me this bill produced —I looked at it and said Holmes this is not Richards acceptance —he said No I will explain to you how that is —he said that Mr Hallows upon whom the bill purports to be drawn kept the Britannia another house at Woolwich that Hallows was related to Mr Richards by marriage and the reason why it was Hallows acceptance was to keep the two accounts distinct but that Richards bought the wine it was all one affair—he represented that Mr Richards was the owner both of the Castle and Britannia and that Hallows conducted the Britannia for him—he said the wine was for the Britannia—he left the bill with me—I did not take it in payment—I said I must have Mr Richards acceptance in lieu of this and moreover I could not take a bill drawn by him upon the parties that the bill must be drawn direct by me—he said he would get Richards acceptance—he asked me if he should endorse the bill and he endorsed it in my presence—I sent the bill to the County Bank—I went down to Woolwich a few days afterwards inquired about a Mr Hallows and found no such person—I saw the prisoner the following day and gave him into custody—I never knew him by the name of

to be a set off for what he owed me and the pipe of port I paid for 30l —7l was a low figure for the sherry—he said it was worth a good deal more but he said as he had kept me out of the money so long he he would give me that over—he did not say whose property the wine was—I have no one connected with me of the name of Hallows—my cousin keeps the Britannia—I and my brother placed her there and to secure ourselves we have it in our name—my cousin s name is Emma Wallis—the prisoner knew I had some connection with that house—nothing was said between me and the prisoner about a person named Hallows—I know nothing about this bill—the prisoner did not give me this invoice—he gave me these two invoices producing them —he wrote them in my presence—I know his handwriting—the name of Holmes and Co to this bill I should think was his writing but I should say the body of the bill is not his—I cannot pass any opinion upon the acceptance—I have lived at Woolwich thirty odd years—I know of no person named Hallows there WILLIAM STONE ROBINSON I am a post-letter receiver at Woolwich and have been so twenty years—during all that time I never knew such a person as William Hallows spirit merchant or any other trade there CHARLES HUNT I am clerk and ledger-keeper at the London and County Bank—no person named William Hallows keeps any account there—I do not know this acceptance Prisoner Q I believe it is not unusual for persons residing in the country to remit sums of money to meet their acceptances which are made payable in London A No it is not MR ROBINSON Q When that is so you always get advice A Yes—I cannot say whether any advice was received of such a bill as this JOSEPH GURNET SALTER The prisoner traded in Savage-gardens under the names of Thomas State Holmes and Co —I have known him not quite three months I was in his employment that time—I knew no person but himself in the concern he said his uncle was who lived at Brighton—the prisoner was at Savage-gardens when I went there JOHN HORTON I have known the prisoner about fourteen years—I never knew him by any other name than Clement Robert Mowbray The bill was here read it was dated Feb 26 1851 drawn by R M

acceptance was given to me by a Mr Hallows who was about opening a wine and spirit-business at Woolwich on account of goods sold by me and that acceptance I gave to Mr Edwards there was no demur on his part at first to taking it but as soon as he raised an objection to it I told him I would get him Mr Richards acceptance but instead of giving me the opportunity of doing that or doing anything be

Lucas—I received this letter produced from him on Monday 14th April and in consequence of that I told my landlady in the prisoner s presence that I expected to receive a letter in the morning and it would contain a Post-office order for half-a-sovereign and I asked her to keep it for me till I came home—I went out at ten o clock next morning and returned at ten at night—I inquired about the letter and was told something about it—the prisoner was not there then—I endeavoured to find him but did not succeed—he came home between eleven and twelve that night very tipsy—I got a policeman and then asked him if he had received a letter for me he said he had not—I asked him again and he said No —I gave him into custody—he was searched and this letter produced was found in his

from there to the party requiring to forward the money—I sent an advice to the Receiving-house at Bloomsbury where the order was payable—this is it CHARLES WYATT MURRAY I am shopman to Mr Palmer of Broad-street Bloomsbury He keeps a receiving-house—we pay money-orders—this letter of advice arrived at the office in due course—it would authorize me in paying 15s to James Weir—on 15th April about eleven o clock a person applied for payment of that 15s —he signed the name of Davis and I refused to pay him—he went away taking the order with him and in about three-quarters of an hour returned with the prisoner—the prisoner then presented the order—I asked him the name of the party that sent him the money he said Scott —he then signed the order James Weir 30 Drury-lane Charles-street and the 15s was given him—some inquiry was soon after made and I gave a description of the persons to the police Prisoner Q When I produced the order to you did you not say it was not payable to me A I said so to the first man that came—you were not the first man you are the second man I am sure of that and that you signed the name of James Weir—I paid you the money and saw you take it—you stated your name to be James Weir WILLIAM FRAPWELL I am in the employ of the keeper of the Receiving-house at Bloomsbury I was there on the morning of the 15th when two persons came together—the prisoner is one of them—I did not see the first man that came—the prisoner signed the order and received the money—I handed him the pen with which he wrote the signature—I am sure he is the man that received the money Prisoner Q You saw me sign the name of William Davis A No I did not see the first man sign I did not see the order after you signed it but I saw you write it in the presence of another man—I did not notice your receiving the money—you brought the order over to the other side to receive it BRIDGET M DONALD I lodged at 30 Charles-street Drury-lane On the morning of 15th April there was a knock at the door—I got up to open it and the prisoner opened it before me and the postman said Is there a man here of the name of James Weir —the prisoner and I both answered Yes and the postman handed a letter to the prisoner—I said Thank God the poor fellow s money is come at last —he turned the letter over looked at it and put it into his pocket—he then went up-stairs and in about five minutes went out—I did not see him again till twelve at night when he was with the policeman and Weir—I said to him You had better give the man his money or his letter before you get into trouble and he said Don t say anything more about it —he was given into custody—Weir said I won t have anything to do with you if you will give me my money or my letter Prisoner Q Is M Donald your name A Yes it is no odds to you what the name of the man is that I am living with now WILLIAM JACKSON policeman F 78 On the night of 15th April I went with Weir to 30 Charles-street—we saw the prisoner there and Weir asked him whether he had received a letter in the morning—he said No and I took him into custody—on going out of the house I saw the prisoner endeavouring to put his hand into his left breast-pocket—I pulled it away put my hand in and brought out this letter from George Lucas of Manchester—I was about to ask him a question and he said Mind what you are about because I know your duty as well as you do for I have been a police-constable myself —I have ascertained that he has not been in the police— the order was here read Prisoner s Defence I am not the man that signed James Weir I only signed William

HUDDLESTON conducted the Prosecution JOHN THOMAS GEORGE DODD I am clerk to Messrs Coutts and Co of the Strand the firm consists of Edward Majoribanks and other persons Mr J Tomlin kept an account there previous to his death for many years—I received this letter of 13th Feb produced by post at the Bank on 14th Feb 1851—it was handed to me for the purpose of sending him a bill—in consequence of this letter I prepared instructions for a Bank post-bill for 50l payable to the order of John Tomlin Esq —these are my instructions to the Bank to prepare the bill for that purpose—Messrs Coutts and Co had to pay the sum of 50l to the Bank and Mr Tomlin s account was debited with the same the same day ALFRED BENNETT I am clerk to Messrs Codd of Fludyer-street they have been agents to Captain Poynts for three years I know the prisoner s handwriting and believe this to be it Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Were you before the Magistrate A I was not I have acquired a knowledge of the handwriting of the prisoner by having been the corresponding clerk to Messrs Codd who had an account with the prisoner from 1845 to 1848 but we had correspondence with the prisoner on other subjects after he left our agency up to the close of last year—I have seen him write on one occasion certainly that was March 18th 1848 but not since that time—I am sorry to say I have no doubt about its being his writing for I had from seventy to a hundred letters from him—I have heard he is the son of an admiral in the navy who is dead—I do not speak from my own knowledge—I have no doubt on the subject— letter read 13th Feb 1851 To Messrs Coutts and Co Post-office Birmingham Gentlemen —Be good enough to send me by return of post a Bank post-bill for 50l I remain yours obediently J TOMLIN THOMAS FRANCIS ARMISTEAD I am a clerk in the Bank Post-bill Office Bank of England I received these instructions from the Bank of Messrs Coutts and Co dated 14th Feb 1851 in compliance with which a Bank post-bill No 3006 B was prepared payable to the order of John Tomlin for 50l value received by Messrs Coutts and Co Cross-examined Q Did you see the Bank post-bill yourself A No the cashier delivered it—I did not see it before or after it was made out MR BODKIN Q Have you in your hand the instructions of Coutts house for the issuing that bill A Yes these are the instructions received with respect to a Bank post-bill on that day—I have made a memorandum—here is the number of the note in my writing—I took the number from the cashier s book—the bills are entered numerically and against the instructions to make a post-bill out for John Tomlin Esq I put the number which is in the cashier s book COURT Q Are any Bank post-bills made out without your orders do you give instructions for all A No not for all post-bills I did not do so on that day—I cannot tell who else gave orders—it is a large office—there are fourteen or fifteen clerks—there is a list kept—to the best of my knowledge it is impossible that any other Bank post-bill to John Tomlin Esq was made out that day MR DODD re-examined I have no doubt this is the bill I sent—I cannot swear to it Cross-examined Q Did you send that bill A I cannot from memory say it was No 3006 I only sent one bill at that time—I sent a bill to John Tomlin Esq on 14th Feb but you ask me to swear to the number and that I cannot do GEORGE AUGUSTUS BRYANT I am a clerk to Messrs Coutts and Co This is the letter-book produced —I copied in it this letter to John Tomlin Esq of Birmingham—I posted it— William Base here produced a copy of the notice

March a gentleman came there—I cannot swear to his being the prisoner it is so long ago—I sold him a silver gilt watch with a silver dial—I cannot say whether this is it produced —this has a gold dial—I made the bargain with the person—he produced a bill—I never looked at it but delivered it to my master JOHN AARON I am a jeweller of Birmingham I was sent for by Pyzer my shopman with respect to the sale of a watch—I saw the prisoner there—he said his name was Captain Stanhope he did not say of what regiment—there are barracks at Birmingham—he did not say where he was living—I took this Bank post-bill from the prisoner and gave him 40l the change between the amount of the watch and the bill— John Tomlin was on the back of the bill—he wrote on it E H Stanhope —this watch has the appearance of the one I sold but the dial has been gilt Cross-examined Q Is that watch what is called a Birmingham A It is a Geneva watch—I have no doubt it has a number I have not looked to see very few are made without—I speak to it to the best of my knowledge from its appearance—I handed the paper myself into the prisoner s hand when he wrote on it—my sister was present—she is not here—I had nothing to do with the transaction except giving change—it was not purchased of me the sale was by my servant—he was not before the Magistrate but I was MAGNUS BOLK I am a watchmaker living in the Western-road Brighton In March last I received this silver gilt Geneva watch from the prisoner—he gave the name of Captain Poyntz—it had a silver dial—I gilt it for him Cross-examined Q Are you sure

original it was returned by the post-office—this letter marked K arrived at the Bank on 16th July— This was a letter signed J Tomlin and dated 15 July to the Governor and Managing Company of the Bank of England repeating the substance of the former letter and begging early attention to it —in consequence of that by arrangement with Mr Mullens another letter was sent by the deputy cashier Mr Elsey but I did not see it Cross-examined Q Did you send this Bank post-bill A Certainly not it would not be in my department—I do not in the least know who sent it WILLIAM FLETCHER I am the manager of the Branch Bank of England at Liverpool On 3rd Sept 1851 this letter marked M arrived there by the post— This was dated Sept 1 1851 addressed to the Branch Bank of England at Liverpool requesting them to place the amount of the Bank post-bill for 50l to the writer s credit at Cocks bank Charing-cross they being duly authorized to receive the same and signed John Tomlin —in that letter there was one enclosed marked L —read— Bank of England Sir —I am in receipt of your letter of yesterday a letter was sent to you addressed to the Post-office Liverpool and returned here again as it had not been

it was the first time you discovered that it was not safe to send Bank-notes by the post A Not the first time—we only send them when they are asked for BRYAN O ROURE I am an Irishman and get my living by going on messages in Liverpool I remember being sent to the post-office at Liver-pool for a letter by a gentlemen who met me and asked me if I wanted a job and I said yes—I do not know who it was—I do not know the name I asked for I am no scholar—I got a letter—I do not know the gentleman who took it of me but he gave me a shilling—after I came from the post-office a policeman from London spoke to me and came and stopped in my room some time—it was Whicher—while he was with me I thought I saw the person who sent me passing my door but I cannot say it was him for I am very short-sighted and it was across the street—Whicher followed him very quickly THOMAS BLOOM I am corresponding clerk in the house of Cocks and Co bankers These letters marked N and O dated Sept 1 and Sept 11 were received by me—I cannot say on what dates Cross-examined Q You were not before the Magistrate A No The first letter was dated Brighton 1st Sept addressed to Messrs Cocks and Co signed John Tomlin and

gave it to her Cross-examined Q Is Mary here to-day A Not that I know of HENRY FIELD On 11th Sept I was in company with Sergeant Whitcher of the detective force—I saw a woman come out of 5 Cunningham-place—I followed her to two or three tradesmen s shops in the Edgeware-road and then to a post-office 116 Edgeware-road—she entered the shop and to the best of my knowledge got some postage-stamps—she came out with a letter which she posted in the box outside—I gave information to Whitcher Cross-examined Q What are you that go about following women A I am an agent of the police—that is the way I get my living—those who employ me pay me—when I am employed by the Commissioners of Police they pay me—I am not employed by them—only one woman came out of the house that morning to my knowledge—it was 2 or 3 o clock in the afternoon probably it was not 4 because we were in the City something like 4—it was somewhere from 2 to half-past 3 or as near to 3 as I can say JONATHAN WHICHER I am a sergeant of the detective police I was instructed to go down to Liverpool on this matter—I left London on the 16th—on the 18th I saw O Rourke at Liverpool at the post-office—I saw him receive a letter—he spoke to a person—I followed him to his lodging and remained there some time and saw the prisoner pass—I was called up to the neighbourhood of the Edgeware-road in Sept last in consequence of information given me by a man named Field who is engaged in matters frequently in the country when applications are made for detective police and he is sent down by the Commissioners and is paid by the parties who employ him—in consequence of what he said I went on 11th Sept to the post-office 116 Edgeware-road and saw a letter taken out of the letter-box addressed Captain Poyntz 25 Foregate-street Chester it was then posted to go with the rest—there were a great many other letters in the box—I went down to Foregate-street Chester that evening and found the prisoner there—I told him I was an officer and apprehended him on suspicion of forging the endorsement to two 50l Bank post-bills in the name of John Tomlin—he said I know nothing about it —I said You have received a letter this morning what have you done with it —he said he had thrown it out of window—I searched the room and found this duplicate produced—dated July 9th 1851 for a gold watch and brooch 5l 10s in the name of Mary Britten Cross-examined Q Are you sure you have told us all he said A Yes all that transpired at the time of his apprehension that related to the case—I did not broach the case at all to him—he did not say I intended no forgery —he said he knew nothing about it—he denied all knowledge of the transaction and said I know nothing about it EDWARD WILLIAM STANLEY I am one of the cashiers of Messrs Contts I knew the late John Tomlin he kept a banking account with them—he was the only person of that name who kept an account there—I am well acquainted with his writing—I should certainly say these letters A and D are not his writing nor are the others CHRISTOPHER BRASCODEMAR I was valet to the late Mr John Tomlin three years and nine months—I remained till his death—he died in my arms on 16th Oct at the York Hotel Brighton—I was always in close attendance on him—he was in a very weak state of health he could not be weaker—I had never seen the prisoner during that time nor heard his name till I saw it in the paper about 13th Sept I cannot say exactly but it was two or three days after we arrived from Brighton—on 18th Dec 1850 I left London with Mr Tomlin—we went to St Leonard s and stopped there till 3rd June when we went to 35 Chapel-street Belgrave-square where we remained till 15th July and then went to Warwick-lodge 1 Addison-road Kensington—we then left and came to St James s-street stopped there four days and then gave up the house and went to Brighton where he remained till he died Cross-examined Q Were you with Mr Tomlin when he had an establishment in Leicestershire A He never did keep an establishment in Leicestershire—I do not know whether he went to hunt there—he never went there while I was with him—the only time I left him while I lived with him was for two days at St Leonard s and his brother was along with him at the time—I had a room of my own at his house—it was not my business to open or shut the door JONATHAN WHICHER re-examined There were three or four remands in this case—I cannot tell the days—it spread over a month GUILTY Aged 36 The prisoner was further charged with having been before

of Addison-row Kensington I became acquainted with the prisoner in 1834—in 1844 he called on me at my residence Ryder-street St James s and I lent him 15l —I did not see him again till June last year when he came to my offices 3 Parliament-street and said he was in very great distress and was endeavouring to effect the sale of some property he was possessed of at Wakefield through his solicitor there and until that was done he had no means of living and for the last two days he had had nothing to eat and if I would give him a few shillings he would pay me when he had his remittance from Mr Westmore-land at Wakefield and he would pay me what he owed me—on 17th June a few days afterwards he called again and said Mr Westmoreland had sent him a bill in part payment and it was of no use to him as be had no credit anywhere and if I would advance him a few pounds it would be of great service to him—he handed me a bill and put his address on it 5 Berwick-street Oxford-street —I gave him 1l which he asked for and he gave me a memorandum putting down the 15l the 10s and the 1l making 16l 10s —the following day he came again and I gave him 2l on 13th July another 1l and on 30th July another 1l —he afterwards called and said he was going down to Wakefield and wanted money and I gave him a check for 8l —when the bill came to maturity I sent it to my bankers and in due time it came back to me—I wrote to the prisoner and to the drawer to Norton the acceptor and the endorser—the letter to the drawer Wilson was returned through the Dead-letter office—at the time he passed the bill the prisoner said Naylor and Co were respectable manufacturers at Wakefield—I knew the name connected with Wakefield—the prisoner put the endorsement John Staples on it at my request—it is his writing—I sent my clerk to the address on the back of the bill but heard nothing Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q He told you he had some land at Wakefield A Some building-ground—I have since heard that that is true and I believe it is—I know very little of his son I never saw him to my knowledge I know nothing to his credit or discredit—I do not think the prisoner mentioned the name of Norton at the time he gave me this bill I have no recollection—I advanced the money at seven different times—I had no hesitation whatever WILLIAM BROOK NAYLOR I am one of the firm of John Naylor and Co cloth-merchants at Wakefield—there is no other Naylor and Co in our trade at Wakefield—I never put my name to a bill for the prisoner—I have never accepted a bill since we have been a firm—this bill is not mine or any of my partners Cross-examined Q You knew that the prisoner had some property at Wakefield A I never knew anything about him till this time—I know nothing of his son JOSEPH WILLIAMS WESTMORELAND I am a solicitor of Wakefield I have been in practice there fourteen years—I have no personal knowledge of the prisoner—I never conducted business for him or had any transaction with him—I never saw this bill till the policeman called on me Cross-examined Q Do you know the prisoner s son A No I live at Wakefield—I have heard that there is property there in which the prisoner has some interest but it is only from rumour—I do not want you to cross-examine me for I am sure the interest I shall speak to will not avail you in any way JAMES M DONALD I am chief constable of Wakefield On 27th Sept I caused two of my officers to take the prisoner—I told him the charge—he said be knew nothing about it he had never uttered such a bill to Mr Ross—on a subsequent occasion he requested to see the bill—it was shown him—he looked at the signature J Stead and said That is my name but it is not my writing I deny the charge in toto Cross-examined Q Is Mr Westmoreland the attorney in this case A No he has no connection with it—I only know by rumour that the prisoner has property in Wakefield—I have heard that he has a son Bill read— Wakefield 17th June 1850 two months after date pay to my order 49l 15s 6d value received W Wilson Accepted George Naylor and Co cloth-merchants Wakefield payable at Messrs Glyn and Co s MR ROBINSON called GEORGE BEARD I am a musician and live in Crown-court Covent Garden I have known the prisoner two years—in June 1850 two gentlemen called at my house—I heard the name of one of them was Harrison—they said they wanted to see Mr Stead—he had an office at my place—they went up to it—the prisoner resided with me till about five weeks ago—he was very well known and had an excellent character—he paid me 20l a year—I have seen him with detective officers at a house which I use myself next door to the station Cross-examined by MR SEYMOUR Q Does any one else lire in your house A Yes it is let out in lodgings—there are ten rooms in it—the prisoner lived as under-tenant in my first-floor front-room as a single man about one year and seven months—he lived there before June 1850 and resided with me till about five weeks ago EDWARD MORRIS I am a tailor of Berwick-street In June 1850 as near as I can recollect the prisoner asked me to take in letters for him Cross-examined by MR SEYMOUR Q How long did you continue to take in letters for him A For several months—I do not know where he resided—he used to come for letters—he used to come to a lodger of mine named Martin and then he asked me to take letters for him JOSEPH WAINWRIGHT I am a solicitor and reside at Wakefield The prisoner had some property there till very lately—I advertised to sell it for him about three years ago—the purchase of it was completed about five weeks ago—to the best of my recollection the produce of the sale was 95l —the prisoner has a son and from documents that I have seen I know the son tried to sell the property and stated that his father was dead Cross-examined by MR SEYMOUR Q Have you got those documents here A No the property was copyhold— the prisoner completed the sale to Mr Thomas Avison—I know that Mr Avison went and paid a mortgage off the deeds and received them—I saw them afterwards in his possession—I think the deeds were deposited for 60l —I believe 60l and something more for interest was deducted from the purchase-money and the rest was paid to the prisoner Joseph Berridge of Swithin s-lane gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY of Uttering Aged 53 —Recommended to mercy by Mr Ross — Transported for

t18511124-31  31 ROBERT FORTESCUE MACKRILL was again indicted for feloniously forging an order for the payment of money MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution JAMES COLQUHOUN I carry on business as a stock-broker at 1 Shorter s-court Throgmorton-street The prisoner was my clerk—on 17th April I had occasion to sign a check for 5l —it is the practice in my business almost invariably for my clerk to prepare the check for the purpose of my signature—when this check looking at it was produced to me for signature it was not in the state it is now—it was for 5l —this is the counterfoil of the check which is in the prisoner s writing—I believe the check was prepared for his own salary—I am quite certain that on 17th April I gave bin no check for 25l —when I signed it it was for 5l —I was not aware of this circumstance till the prisoner was apprehended—I took the prisoner myself and delivered him up at the station at Whitechapel—this check it in the prisoner s writing and when brought to me was for 5l the twenty which is now in it before the word five I believe is the prisoner s writing—I have no doubt of it whatever looking at five other checks —these are entire forgeries signatures and all—on this 10l bank-note produced is the name Robert F Mackrill which I have no doubt is the prisoner s writing COURT Q In whose hand-writing are those five checks A I believe the prisoner s—I have no doubt of it whatever Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q When did the prisoner enter your service A I believe about Aug 1850 and continued till the 28th or 29th Oct last—he was the only clerk in my office with the exception of a young man I had on trial for a few days in April—I had a character with the prisoner—he was in the habit of filling up the body of the checks and when he presented them to me I signed them—it might happen that I had a great many checks to sign in a day—I generally signed them in my office—the prisoner filled up the body of the check handed it to me and I signed it looking generally at the margin except it came from another member of the house and that was a crossed check generally which had been filled up by the prisoner for another member of the Stock Exchange—on these occasions I had not an opportunity of examining it with the counterfoil—this check was for 5l I know that by looking at the counterfoil and besides I never gave the prisoner a check for 25l for himself—this is made payable to himself the word Salary is on it Q How is it that in the counterfoil the figure seems to have been erased A That may have been a mistake in the number—the counterfoil is made to correspond with the check—I did that a few nights ago at my own house and I did it in blue ink that I might know it—no doubt he had filled up a wrong number—I had no idea that the check had been altered I never was indebted to him 25l and never gave him a check for 25l for himself—I have given him a check for 25l for other parties—I was in some difficulties in May—I did not go out of town I remained in London—I did not go to Glasgow at that time—I might go after the temporary difficulty I was in—I have no recollection of it in fact I don t remember going there at all—I was often in Glasgow this year but I don t remember being in Glasgow in May—it was not while I was in difficulties that I went—the prisoner was at my place—he never drew a check for me—the prisoner drew my checks under a special provision—I gave him authority to draw for James Colquhoun signed Robert F Mackrill but signed by Mr Lermitte another member of the Stock Exchange without which they were not to be paid—he had authority under these conditions—I think that was during the latter end of March or the beginning of April—it was necessary that some one should give checks COURT Q Did you tell him that they would not be paid by the Bank unless they were signed by Mr Lermitte A Yes I directed him to get the signature of Mr Lermitte—he had authority to sign the checks and there were instructions given to the Bank not to pay them till they were signed by Mr Lermitte MR RIBTON Q That was a sort of check on the prisoner A Yes there have not to my knowledge been complaints by the bankers of difference between the pass-book and the cash slips of paper—the prisoner would frequently take those slips to the Bank and frequently I have taken them—I never made any erasures in the cash-book or the banker s book—this erasure in the counterfoil was done a few days ago because the numbers did not correspond—it may have been an error or a figure badly made that I have put right—I am not in the habit of letting my books go for some considerable time without looking into them—I generally do it once a fortnight and oftener if I can find time—no one has ever complained of my not examining my books or letting them go a long time without examining them—no one had a right to make such a complaint—I have not offered that if a certain sum of money were handed to me that I would forego this prosecution—I know Mrs Harris—I have understood she is the prisoner s aunt—I have not made such an offer to heir—I made no offer if I could get money to stop the prosecution MR CLARKSON Q Had you placed implicit confidence in the prisoner A Most unbounded confidence—I give a great many checks—it was the prisoner s business to fill up the checks and put the amount in the counterfoil—the alteration I have made in the check-book is the alteration of the number and that was done since the prisoner has been committed—that alteration would not alter the date nor the sum—this sum of 5l has not undergone the slightest alteration—there is no other sum of 5l or 25l dated 17th April—my transactions in a day very often amount to thousands JOHN PRINCE LEMMON I am clerk to Martin Stone and Martin bankers Lombard-street Mr Colquhoun banks with that house—on 17th April I paid this check for 25l —I gave 15l in money and a 10l —note No 99530 dated 10th Jan 1851—this is the note looking at it RICHARD ADET BAILIE I am in the accountant s office in the Bank of England—I produce this 10l —note cancelled—it is signed Robert Fortescue Mackrill EDWARD SHERIDAN policeman K 286 I received the prisoner in custody from the prosecutor—I searched him and found these five checks in the left sleeve of his coat Cross-examined Q Did you hear the prosecutor offer to forego this prosecution A He did not say he would forego the prosecution he said if he restored his property he would have him dealt with as leniently as the law would permit The checks found on the prisoner were here read three were dated 16th Aug and were for 2l 10s 5l and 4l 13s 9d and the other 23rd Aug for 10l and 27th Aug for 7l 10s all signed Jas Colquhoun COURT to MR COLQUHOUN Q What was the prisoner s salary A 50l a year—it was not so much at first and it has been reduced lately—I never saw these five checks at all till they were found in the prisoner s sleeve—I am satisfied they came from my check-book—I find the counterfoils torn away in several places The prisoner received a good character from Mary Ann Parry and Elizabeth Harris GUILTY Aged 19 — Transported for Seven Years 
t18511124-60  60 THOMAS ROBERT MELLISH and JAMES DOUGLAS feloniously forging and uttering a receipt for 4l 10s with intent to defraud MESSRS CLARKSON and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution FREDERICK HALE THOMSON I am by profession a surgeon I purchased a share in a patent for silvering glass Mr Varnish was my partner In the autumn of 1849 I engaged the prisoner Hellish for the purpose of carrying out some views I had some methods of making glass for the purpose of employing the silvering process—I had strong recommendations with him and believed he understood perfectly the directing the making glass at Powell s glass-works—I knew nothing of engraving or staining glass and Mellish was engaged to superintend that part of the arrangements to overlook the men engaged in that portion of the business—there was an agreement in writing The agreement was here produced by Mr Cookney the attesting witness it was dated 26th Dec 1849 between Messrs Thomson and vanish and Thomas Robert Mellish by which Mellish engaged to give his services to them in the business of silvering glass they agreeing to pay him 6l 6s per week for the same as long as he continued to employ himself in the business eight hours a day —after that agreement Mellish came and took the sole control and management of the glass-cutters and mounters—he engaged them and paid them their wages he arranged their rate of wages entirely—I never saw them until after they were in our employment and I knew nothing of the rate of wages he engaged them for—I engaged Douglas at Mellish s particular desire about April 1850—he said he wanted a clerk to be under his care in his office and he knew a most desirable young man for it in Birmingham and he would send for him—he fixed the rate of wages that Douglas was to have without reference to me and when he had done that he told me he had concluded the arrangement and produced Douglas—I believe he told me the amount of Douglas s wages but I do not recollect what the exact amount was—it was between 25s and 30s a week but some months afterwards he raised his wages I cannot speak positively—the premises where the work is carried on are in Wells-mews at the back of Berners-street and the establishment where the articles are sold is in Regent-street—the glass-cutters and mounters engaged by Mellish were placed by him in shops on the premises and he employed for various purposes several outdoor workmen who I did not even know by sight—I was not acquainted with the proper rate of wages for articles of that kind and I engaged Mellish on that account—Douglas and Mellish had at first one office between them with a large double desk at which they sat side by side—some months afterwards an inner room was prepared by Mellish what he called his own room a large table was got and it was fitted up as his private room—he had boxes made for the purpose of keeping the vouchers and bills in as he said when they were returned to him—I have frequently been through the room in which the double desk was when Douglas and Mellish were both there—I have done so daily from July to Sept but more frequently even than that—I used to go and see how the work was carried on—Mellish was continually at the desk and Douglas likewise—I saw the wages-book constantly on Mellish s desk—he had the workmen s names entered in it and the rate of wages—this is it produced —I have seen it daily on the double desk—it was the rule to enter in that book the amount of wages earned by the out-door servants and the in-door likewise—my instructions to Mellish were that as he undertook the sole management of the wages-book and paying the wages he should be answerable to me for the accounts and documents which he undertook to be—I used generally to go up the first thing in the morning and inquire how he was getting on what return he was likely to have for the men who were in considerable numbers at work and what return the business was making—he invariably told me the business was going on most satisfactorily be only wanted time to carry on the thing and if I would leave the matter to him till the World s Fair opened I should have ample remuneration for what we were doing and I left it entirely to him—I have remarked to him that the accounts were very heavy that a great expense weekly was incurred—he always said it was essential that such expenses should be incurred before returns could be expected and I should be satisfied if I left it to him—I do not recollect that I spoke to him about the vouchers—I did not know of there being a couple of bills made out by the men who work out of doors I knew nothing at all about it—I am speaking of the first period when Mellish was in my employ the second period was after it was discovered that frauds had been committed—I had not been informed of the two bills up to the time Douglas was given into custody Cross-examined by MR MONTAGUS CHAMBERS Q You say you are a surgeon A Yes I have been in considerable practice—I was very much engaged in professional business until I embarked in this silvering of glass—I then gave up my practice to a considerable extent but was still engaged in it at 48 Berners-street Oxford-street closely adjacent to the premises—I made an agreement to carry out the patent with a man named Thomas Drayton about Oct 1848—I had commenced working the patent and had silvered a great many things before I was introduced to Mr Mellish—the cause of ray introduction to him was not some ink-bottles or inkstands being sent to me by Mr Lund of Fleet-street it was my speaking to Mr Powell the owner of Whitefriars glass-works telling him I wanted a man to carry out the silvering—that must have been in the summer of 1849—I recollect Mellish bringing some inkstands from Mr Lund to be silvered that was previous to my entering into a written agreement with him but he had been with me a good deal in my silvering-room—I learned afterwards that a person had suggested the idea of silvering inkstands and that Mr Lund had an interest in the patent—I did not learn from Mellish that Mr Lund had made him a present of his interest—I have not silvered any ink-bottles myself of that construction my first experiments with Mr Lund s inkstands were perfectly successful as far as the silvering went they were perfectly silvered but the ink being poured in upon it took off the silver—Mellish did not invent the plan of a double glass—I took out a patent for that very purpose that was not the patent in which I had purchased an interest in the first instance—I never knew Mellish make any experiments in putting the silver between two glasses he took my directions to make glass suitable for my patent which I had been at work at months before I knew there was such a man as Mellish in the world I hired him for the purpose of going to Powell s glass-works and making hollow glass for the purpose of the patent which I had been at work at for months—the first patent in 1848 was for silvering glass and other surfaces—I got the second patent for introducing silver between two glasses in Dec 1849 two months after Mellish had worked for me—previous to getting out that patent I had tried the experiment and had shown it it was perfectly well known—Mellish was engaged in making those experiments before I took out the patent—the inkstands sent by Mr Lund were not with a double hollow—I do not remember that a second set of inkstands were sent by Mr Lund when the silver was introduced between two plates of glass so as to prevent the operation of the ink—Mr Varnish was the active man and looked after the mercantile part but had nothing to do with the silvering he knew nothing about it—I knew something about it I was the only person who did I patented it—I suggested after conversing with Mr Varnish that we should take out a second patent to protect the silver entirely by hermetically sealing it from the atmosphere introducing it between two coatings of glass but I want to explain to the Court if I were to take this inkstand silver it and then drop this little glass-holder into it it would be an inkstand silvered between two coatings of glass but that is totally distinct—preventing the air from getting to it is what I call hermetically sealing it—I took out a third patent in the conclusion of 1850 in my name and that of Mellish—it was for improvements in staining and cutting glass for the purpose of silvering cutting it in a peculiar manner—I did not make articles under that patent—I am not aware that any were in the Exhibition I exhibited some articles of double hollow work of every description—Mr Deane has got the list of articles exhibited from our firm—Mellish had no joint-interest in any manufacture connected with the silvering of glass that I am aware of it was never carried out—I saw the patent that I and Mellish took out the agent who took it out for us was Mr Cartmell—I believe I and Mellish saw him previous to taking it out we asked him his opinion it was in the autumn of 1850—I cannot swear which of us described the patent to Mr Cartmell it was taken out conjointly—it was described as a patent for cutting staining silvering and fixing articles of glass—I cannot speak to the very words—I believe I understood the invention thoroughly when I went to Mr Cartmell—I thought I did at the time—I had gone through the matter myself—I do not know that anybody told me what it was—I swear Mellish did not tell me the whole process he might have suggested some portion of it and I believe he did he suggested some portion of the cutting as a practical man—he had not been engaged in the silvering of glass for eighteen months he had nothing to do with the scientific part—I did not direct Mr Cookney to draw up a paper and present it for the signature of Mellish the matter was talked over by Mellish myself and Mr Cookney but I am not aware that I gave any special instructions on the subject—Mr Cookney did draw up a paper for Mellish to sign after I bad got the last patent Mellisb refused to sign it—I did not tear it op I believe it is in Mellish s possession—I did not present it to him I cannot say whether Mr Cookney did—Mellish eventually refused to me to resign his interest in that patent after telling me two or three times that he would—I was present when the agreement was presented to him but whether it was tendered to him to sign I do not know—I was not present when it was thrown on the fire—I did not say I had thrown it on the fire—it was about the spring of 1851 that he refused to relinquish his interest in the patent it was at Berners-street—I think it was in May this year that he left my service about a month or six weeks after he had refused to relinquish his interest—after he bad refused to sign a paper in Berners-street I believe another paper was drawn up for him to sign—I really do not recollect whether that was presented to him for signature or whether be refused to sign it—I do not remember being present when it was presented to him—I believe a second was presented two or three weeks before he was discharged—the second paper was not prepared with a view of my taking Mr Cookney in as a partner in that patent not that I am aware of no such understanding ever came to my knowledge—Mr Cookney had an interest in the glass silvering long before that patent—I never made any proposal to take him in as a partner in the patent which I and Mellish had taken out but I believe it was understood thus that as he had an interest in the patent of the silvering he must have an interest in the patent now—it was not proposed that Mellish should relinquish his interest in the patent of Thomson and Mellish and that Cookney should be introduced—it was not arranged that as soon as Mellish relinquished his interest Cookney should be a partner I know nothing of it—Cookney had an interest in it previous to the two prisoners being taken up—I never heard of its being proposed that when Mellish relinquished his interest Cookney should become a partner in Mellish and Thomson s patent—it was not proposed that Cookney should come in at all—it had long before 1851 been understood that if a partnership was drawn up that Mr Cookney s name would be included with mine and Mr Varnish s—I never heard that it was proposed in 1851 that we three should become partners and get the relinquishment of Mellish s right in the patent of Mellish and Thomson—Mr Lund has two shops one in Fleet-street and the other in Cornhill—he spoke very well of Mellish to me—he said he had known him some considerable time and he was a very painstaking man—Mr Powell of Whitefriars glass-works recommended him to me as a man who would carry out what I wanted—I do not know where Mellish lived at the time be entered my service in Oct —I believe he had workshops in Great Portland-street at the time he first came to me—I have been to them two or three times—I believe he continued to have them the whole time he was with us and that was one of the grievances why I wished to part with him—I never went there latterly—I understood that workmen were sent by him from the one house to the other—I do not know how many workmen he had at one time he had between thirty and forty on the premises at Berners-street—I am not speaking with certainty—there was not a steam-engine erected—he brought a great quantity of machinery when he came into my service and put it up at my expense—he afterwards employed a carpenter to erect some machinery for the glass-cutters Mellish attended to the account —a shop was also taken and Mrs Mellish was sent there to keep it—I really do not know exactly when that was—Mellish and his wife managed the shop—it was not me that made that arrangement Mr Varnish I believe can tell you all about it—the shop was kept in the name of Mrs Mellish—I used to send glass there invoiced to her and she and some assistants attended to keeping the accounts and selling the goods at the Regents-street shop—Mellish lived there he went there in the evening—I do not know that when he undertook that his wife should go there on my account that he relinquished his residence in Great Portland-street and sold off his furniture—the real accountant in the business was Mr Deane Mr Varnish attended to the mercantile part he went to mercantile men about the shipping and the sales—Mellish regulated the cost and selling-price of the goods he put a profit on as the selling price that all belonged to his department I believe he consulted with Mr Varnish on the subject—I do not recollect his going three times to Paris in our service—he was absent a fortnight in Paris once I believe—I cannot say whether he went twice or three times I believe he went twice I am uncertain about three times—he was absent about a fortnight each time—Mr Varnish was with him once I believe—Mr Deane the accountant kept the books in Berners-street—I cannot positively swear that I know the cost-price book when I see it I believe I do—the books were not in my department and I did not examine them—I believe I can tell the sale-price book when I see it—I must have looked into the books—I am convinced that I did occasionally—I can swear I looked into the book where the entries were made of goods that went abroad to different people—that was during the eighteen months Mellish was with me—there are so many books that I cannot say whether that was the only one I looked into—it does not belong to my department to look into the books mine is the scientific department—Mr Varnish conducted the commercial department assisted by the clerk—it was not my duty to examine the books till I discovered the frauds—it was about four or five months after Mellish left that I caused Douglas to be taken into custody—I swear I heard Mellish say he wanted a clerk—I believe Mr Varnish was present—I am not aware that Mellish was in ill health from his attention and labour at the time Douglas came—I am not aware that he had worked for us continually day and night and that his health was affected—it was not proposed then by me and Mr Varnish that he should have assistance not in that department—I will not swear it was not said to Mellish—I am not aware of it—I am not prepared to swear that I proposed it or that I did not—Mellish proposed Douglas as his clerk—I had not proposed that he should have assistance not as a clerk—I should say Mr Varnish was present when Mellish spoke about Douglas I do not positively recollect but he was there every day—it was at Berners-street that Mellish mentioned it—I cannot recollect in what room—I suppose it must have occurred in my library or in Mellish s room—I believe it must have been in my library that is my impression—I cannot say whether it was night or day it was some weeks before Douglas came—I left it to Mellish to make inquiries as to who Douglas was and I believe Mr Varnish left it to him—I think Mrs Mellish was keeping the shop at the time Douglas was spoken of but upon my word I cannot be positive on that point—I do not recollect having a conversation with Mellish about his health about May 1851 just before he went away—I do not remember his saying he did not feel inclined to sacrifice his own and his wife s health any longer by remaining—I cannot swear distinctly that he did not—I believe just before he went he desired me to send some person to take charge of the stock in Regent-street on the following Monday morning in consequence of which Mr Varnish and Mr Deane sent somebody to take charge of the stock in Regent-street—I believe that conversation was at Berner s-street—I believe his wife left on the following Monday—I do not know the exact day for I did not go near the place Mr Dean and Mr Varnish were the persons—I know they left about that time but I cannot say it was on a Monday Q Was the wife ever paid for her services for keeping that shop in her own name and having the goods invoiced to her A She was paid by having the house-rent free and coals and candles—I do not know that they had removed their goods on the Saturday from Regent-street to a lodging in Great Portland-street—I do not recollect going to Regent-street on the Saturday previous to the Monday I know Mr Varnish did—I do not recollect hearing him say Well Mellish then you have made up your mind to go —I will not swear I was not at Regent-street with Mr Varnish when he said so—I do not remember hearing Mr Mellish say Yes people are better parted that cannot agree —I do not remember Mellish saying to me Mr Thomson have you anything more to say —I remember no conversation of the sort—I do not recollect being there on the Saturday before Mellish left with Mr Varnish or being there that day at all—I do not recollect anything at all on that Saturday—I did not see the scattered furniture of Mr Mellish nor did I say This looks shocking —I did not hear Mellish say in my presence If it shocks you what must those feel who have suffered so much by their connection with the business —before Mellish left I had a conversation with Douglas about Mellish s patterns Mellish used to draw the patterns for the glass —I may have said to Douglas that now Mellish was going he would see a great improvement in the patterns I do not remember it—I spoke continually to Douglas of course—I have no doubt I said there would be an improvement—I am not aware that Mellish said If so you shall begin afresh for yourself and shall not have my patterns or sketches to work with and throw them into the fire—to the best of my belief nothing of the kind passed—nothing certainly was said about Mellish s patterns they were not his they were mine and if he had thrown them into the fire I should have given him into custody—I afterwards improved upon those patterns very much indeed—I said three weeks before be went that I should have a scientific person to improve the work and that he was incapable of it—it was one of the great causes of his leaving that I required a higher person to carry out the thing in a higher grade of art—I believe that might have been after his refusal to sign either of the papers—persons did not pass through his private room to go the workshop only through the office where the double desk was—I occasionally went into his private office—persons used to see him there and in the office—he used to be attending to the workmen during the day continually—he occasionally worked with his own hands some of the finishing in a very slight degree—I never saw him in a working-dress—one of the artists worked in that private room for a few weeks before Mellish left—he placed him there—I believe a carpenter on the premises made the boxes for Mellish—he told me he had had them made to keep the bills and vouchers in—that was months before he left me—they were left behind when he went and Douglas took charge of them—Dean came in the spring of 1850 some time after Mellish had been there—before that Mr Varnish used to do the business of the accountant—he hired Dean by my consent—Mr Varnish directed the office business—I used continually to go into the room where the double desk was to see the work as it progressed day by day under Mellish to see what quantity was done—as the workmen finished it they brought it to Mellish—Mellish had a large mahogany table with drawers in it in his private room—he was very frequently at the double desk—I saw him examining books in which diagrams and patterns were kept and the wages book—those were the only two books I saw—I first looked into the wages book when it was first established which was in the beginning of 1850 soon after Douglas came Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Was Douglas a clerk under Mellish A Yes he was entirely under his control and direction—it was Douglas s duty to obey implicitly any directions Mellish gave him he had no option—he had 25s or 30s a week at first and afterwards Mellish raised him to 35s —Dean the cashier was under the control of the firm Mr Varnish especially—I believe the cashier gave the money weekly to Douglas to pay the men—it was Mellish s duty to see that the vouchers for the wages were correct that was what he was hired for—Mellish purchased glass for us at Messrs Powell s the large glass-dealers Q Do you know that Mr Douglas by any steps he took was the means of reducing your expenditure at all A I know he has checked Powell s bills and after Mellish left he did the same and he reduced the bills certainly—we dealt in a small way with a person named Sago—I cannot say whether or not that it was at Douglas s suggestion that we should save a considerable percentage but we did get some things there and saved a considerable percentage—I do not know that we got them seventy per cent below the price we were paying Powell s but it was considerably less—Douglas had no authority to reduce the expenditure while he was under Mellish but after Mellish left I remember an instance of his checking a bill of Powell s when there was a mistake of 20l and it was immediately allowed and I believe he was the means of reducing other expenditures after Mellish left MR BALLANTINE Q The first agreement do you know anything about the destruction of that or is it still in Mellish s custody as far as you know A I know nothing about it I believe it is in his custody entirely and I believe a copy of the second agreement proposed is in Mellish s possession and a copy in Mr Dean s—Mellish was discharged a few weeks after that last negotiation and when he had been discharged four or five months we gave Douglas into custody—that had nothing on earth to do with Mellith—at that time we did not at all contemplate giving Mellish into custody but a few days afterwards one of my assistants brought me some bills with Mellish s initials to them which I found had been altered to a very great extent before they were paid and after that we gave Mellish into custody—we had not the most remote intention of doing so before—the papers were vouchers of accounts which had been altered—I gave Douglas into custody after receiving a letter which I have got and after examining the books—the expenses which Douglas saved us were all after Mellish bad left—he did not save any to my knowledge before Mellish left—the firm paid the expense of putting up the machinery and also of the journeys to Paris—the patterns belonged to the firm—he did not bring them with him when he came—they were drawn in the office after he came into our service WILLIAM BENSON LEE I am an engraver on glass and live in James-street Kennington I know Mellish and have known him fifteen or sixteen years—I formerly worked at Mercian s the pencil-case makers not on the premises—I lived in the country then—at the time I worked for them Mellish was a traveller for the house—that is more than twelve years ago—in consequence of something I heard with reference to Messrs Thomson s establishment in Berners-street about two years ago I went to the premises in Wells-street—I there saw Mellish and he employed me to work for the prosecutors—Mellish arranged the price of the work that I was to be paid—I never saw Mr Thompson on the matter until this job happened—when I did the work I took the bill in with it and was paid—I only took one bill in but I signed another which was made out for me afterwards—I was asked to do so by Mr Mellish and Douglas as well—I believed it to be the system of the firm—I believe Douglas made out the second bill upon every occasion—I expected it was the system of the firm to have one to remain in one room and the other to go to the counting-house—the other remained with Mr Mellish I expected but I knew nothing of their arrangements—Mr Mellish gave me directions to make oat two bills I cannot say when—I have not done any work for the firm for above a year—it was upon each occasion for about three months or something of the kind which was about the extent of the time I worked for the firm—on 14th Sept 1850 I carried in an account to Wells-street—this produced is it—it is for 1l —if this was the last account it was delivered by my son to Mr Mellish—I went on Monday and Mr Douglas paid me the money—this account is in my writing—it is dated 14th Sept —I had no further demand on the firm on 14th Sept but that pound—when I went on the 16th to Wells-street I saw Douglas in his office where the desk was—I went up the steps on the outside—Douglas told me that Mr Mellish said the work was not done as it ought to be and he would not pay me for it—Douglas said he would willingly pay me but I had better go and see Mr Mellish—I then went to Regent-street to see Mr Mellish—I saw Mrs Mellish but not Mr Mellish—I did not see Mr Mellish at all on the subject matter of that account—I returned to Wells-street and saw Douglas—I asked him to go and fetch the pattern he had shown me and compare mine with his and say which was the better—he said certainly he must say mine was but Mr Mellish said it was bad and he had no voice in it—Douglas paid me that pound—before he paid me I signed a second account besides the one I had brought with me—that was at Douglas s request—the signature to this account for 4l 10s is mine but when I signed it it was for 1l only—that second account does not contain the items—I did not write the second account it was written for me and I signed it—after signing it I delivered it to Douglas—I first saw it was for 4l 10s at Messrs Thompson and Varnish s manufactory seven or eight weeks ago—the initials T R M are upon this account—they were not there when I signed it—I never authorised Douglas or anybody else to alter that account from 1l to 4l 10s nor was I aware there bad been any such alteration made until I saw it seven or eight weeks ago at Messrs Thompson s—I never received any such money—I never received more than li at any time—that was the greatest amount I ever received from them at any time—I received 1l on two occasions and never more than that—this account of 30th July 1850 for 8s is in my writing—I took that to Wells-street—I took all the others but the last one and I saw Mr Mellish and Mr Douglas on all other occasions—I was paid 8s on that occasion—the prisoners were both present at the time I was paid—I also signed this second account—it was then for 8s —it is Douglas s writing—I signed it the same as on all occasions it was put before me and I signed it—I cannot say either the one or the other requested me to do so—Mr Mellish was present when I signed it—it is now an account for 2l 18s —there are the same initials to this account as the former one—they were not there at the time I signed it—I never received any other sum than 8s in respect of that account either at the time I was paid or at any subsequent time—I delivered these two accounts to Douglas in Mellish s presence—this account of 17th July for 1l is in my writing and signed by me—I handed it to Mr Douglas or Mr Mellisb I cannot say which they were both there—this second account was prepared for me by Douglas on that occasion which I signed—it was then for 1l —it is now for 4l 10s —I never received more than 1l in respect of that transaction or ever claimed more—the same initials are on that account and also two that I never saw before—Mr Dean s is one—these initials T R M were not there when I signed it—on 19th July 1850 I carried this other account to the firm—it is for 8s —it is in my writing—here is a second account in Douglas s writing—I signed that—it was then for 8s —it is now 2l 18s —that account has no initials on it except Mr Deane s—I never claimed or received more than 8s in respect of that account—on 27th July I carried iq this account for 10s in my writing—Mr Mellish and Douglas were present when I presented it—I signed a second account on that occasion—this is it—it was for 10s when I signed it—it is now 2l 10s —that was prepared by Douglas—I received my money in the presence of Mellish and Douglas—I never authorized anybody to alter that account in my name to 2l 10s nor did I claim or receive more than 10s upon it Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q As far as you know had Mr Mellish the control of the business there A Yes I know nothing as to whether he was a partner in the firm—I was not led to any idea that he was or was not he appeared to have the general control and management for what I knew he might have been a partner—I had known him for some years—I did not know him in reference to this business until I heard they were busy and applied for work—he had not to my knowledge been previously connected with the trade—I had not known Douglas at all before he was there—I am not a Birmingham man Q Are you at all aware of this circumstance that at times when certain workmen have been employed and either gone away from illness or others substituted for them that the wages have been entered to the names of the first men that were employed A No I know nothing of that—I worked out of doors—I never worked on the premises MR THOMPSON re-examined The initials T R M on the second of each of these three accounts of 14th Sept 30th July and 17th Aug are Mellish s writing—I am well acquainted with his writing—I have seen a great many bills BENJAMIN DEAN I am clerk and cashier to the prosecutor—I became so after Mellish was employed—it was my duty as cashier to pay the amount of money necessary for the wages—for the purpose of ascertaining the amount that would be required a wages book was produced to me it was the custom to have the wages book produced this is it produced —Douglas was in the habit of producing that book to me he paid all the workmen—this book includes both the in-door and out-door workmen Douglas paid them both I gave him the money to pay with—the book was handed to me after the money was given—I gave the money on Saturday and the book was produced on the Monday or Tuesday probably—it is in Douglas s writing—I suppose it would be Mellish s duty as general manager to look over it and see that the men were paid properly—I have never seen him looking over the book—I sat in another office in a different part of the building—the book was produced to me with vouchers the receipts from the different persons— looking at the receipts produced I find here a receipt for 4l 10s on 16th Sept —I can tell that that was produced to me it has my initials on it it also has Mellish s initials to the best of my knowledge that is to certify that the voucher is correct—I should not have passed it without his initials after July or Aug 50—previous to that time the accounts came up I thought rather loosely and either Mr Thompson ordered the initials or it was done at my suggestion I cannot now recollect which but for regularity s sake I said I would rather the manager signed them first—I cannot recollect whether I said so to Mellish but after a particular period I would not pass the bills without those initials without inquiry—that 4l 10l is entered in the book as paid—I have seen all these receipts except the one of 30th July for 2l 18s that has not passed through my hands or it would have the folio of the wages book upon it which it is my habit to put—I find in the wages book the sum of 4l 10s entered on 16th Sept in Douglas s writing—it is charged as having been paid to Lee—on 17th Aug I find 4l 10s charged as having been paid to Lee and on 27th July 2l 10s all in Douglas s writing—on 19th July 2l 18s is charged as paid to Lee—I do not find 2l 18s on 80th July entered in the wages book—I am not able to point out that item—the other items were paid by me to Douglas included in a lump sum—I never saw any of these other bills for the smaller amounts the only vouchers produced to me contained the altered amounts Cross-examined by MR CHAMBBRS Q Are you the accountant to the firm now A I am I first became so at the beginning of April 1850 there was no accountant previously I believe—I believe one of the partners had acted as such I occasionally used to sign vouchers—I did not put my initials against any vouchers or bills except as to their examination not as to their correctness only in comparing the bill with the book—if Douglas brought me a bill not vouched by Mellish I should return it and ask why it was not so—there are two accounts here which do not bear Mellish s initials—they have been passed and paid by me my initials are upon them as having passed them—one is dated 19th July and the other 27th July 50—I put my initials to them because they agreed with the wages book which Douglas brought to me finding they agreed with that I put my initials—I cannot recollect the circumstance of passing these two or when I paid them—I have no recollection of having done it—I have put my initials to several others which had not Mellish s initials previous to a certain date upon finding that it agreed with this book—I put my initials for my own satisfaction to vouch that it was a correct payment as represented by Douglas that it agreed with the book—if I had had any idea that there was anything wrong in the representation or in the book I should certainly not have put my initials to the vouchers—I did not keep that set of vouchers in the counting-house when I had looked at them and compared them with the book I returned them in the book—in consequence of the irregular way in which the accounts had been kept a new arrangement was made somewhere about July or Aug 1850—I did not keep or attend to the cost-price book—Mr Mellish did and the sale-price book also—those books are here—I have not looked at them lately it is not my business to look at them I have seen them but not examined them they were left behind when Mellish left the service—I do not know enough of the business to know how the entries are made in the cost-price book—I should think the mode of doing it is to know the cost of the labour and what has been paid—I cannot recollect who was present when the new arrangement was made about July I cannot recollect the circumstances of it I have tried to do so Q Was it not arranged that Mr Mellish should have a set of detailed accounts so as to make out the cost-price book A Yes they were kept back for that purpose I believe—he kept back one set of the detailed accounts to make out his cost-price book COURT Q I do not quite understand this what was to be kept back A One copy for the price-book I believe the arrangement was that two sets of Touchers were to be mode out one a detailed account MR CHAMBERS Q Was not Mr Mellish to have the detailed account to make out the cost-price book A That was what he kept the account back for—there was a detailed account and a bill delivered COURT Q Was it pursuant to an arrangement made on behalf of the firm that there should be two sets of documents kept for every workman s bill a detailed account and a general account A That was Mr Mellish s arrangement MR CHAMBERS Q Was it in July that Mr Mellish made that arrangement A Either July or Aug —he said he was to keep back one of those accounts for the purpose of making out the cost-price book—one of the accounts was handed to me as a voucher—the one in a lump sum was sent to me—I believe this small account is a detailed account such as it was arranged Mellish should have delivered to him Q Is not the other one that has had the figures altered the general account which it was arranged should be delivered to Douglas to pay on A it was the arrangement of Mr Mellish he stated that he would do it in July—I always received the general accounts from Douglas in settling the books with him from the commencement—the double accounts were put there before that time it was only regarding the initials I spoke COURT Q How early were the double accounts A I think almost from the first commencement of my term—the double account was not an arrangement made in July or Aug that was merely the initials to be put on MR CHAMBERS Q Then from your first coming was that the course of business A I believe so from the beginning—the only alteration made in July was that Mellish was to put his initials to the general account to certify its correctness—Douglas used to bring me the book with these general accounts I used to look at them to see that they tallied with the book and then return the book with them in it to him—Mellish had the general management—the moneys I gave Douglas I considered were sent to Mellish—he received his own wages from me Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q You say that Douglas was the person to whom you delivered the money is that so A Yes on account of Mr Mellish on account of that department which was under Mr Mellish s control and management—I treated Douglas as Mr Mellish s clerk—I used to apply to Douglas on the Thursday and Friday to know what money would be required for the wages for out door-work on Saturday in order to make up my accounts and what I call the lump amount was the whole amount that was required—here is the entry in the wages book of Lees 4l 10s on 14th Sept pointing it out —I believe this is in Douglas s handwriting—all the entries are in his writing—this entry is dated 21st Sept here which was the Saturday the wages were always paid on the Saturday—this contains the wages of the prior week—I could not tell the exact amount I paid Douglas in a lump on that occasion perhaps it might be 50l or 60l that week—there are a great many entries on 21st Sept relating to the wages of the week ending on that day—there may be thirty-five or thirty-six entries on that day—I gave the money to Douglas in a lump and he furnished me with a written memorandum or I O U for the lump sum—that was destroyed on the Monday when he made his book up—he would sometimes have a balance to pay back to me out of the lump sum that would depend upon the amount made up in the book—I did not examine the vouchers before I gave him the lump sum—I did not get the vouchers till the following week—Douglas did not give me forty fifty or sixty vouchers at a time perhaps there would not be above half-a-dozen of these vouchers in a week—these are out-door accounts—I had no vouchers for the men s wages except the book—I have never been present at the payment of the wages—my office was in the same establishment but in front of the house—I had the entire control of the cash—it was not to me that Douglas pointed out an error of 20l as against my masters—he has never pointed out any errors to me—I was not under Mr Mellish s control at all—I did not retain the vouchers—they were returned back to that department in the book to Mellish I consider—they were delivered to Douglas as Mellish s clerk—I am aware that from time to time advances have been made to the men out of the ordinary payments—there used to be a certain sum of money advanced on the Wednesday for that purpose and then on the Saturday we made up the full lump sum—I advanced that sum on the Wednesday to Douglas to be advanced to the men as a portion of the Saturday s moneys—it was 10l or 15l or something of that sort—I took an I O U from Douglas for it which was afterwards destroyed Q Do you know whether Mellish has ordered money to be paid to the workmen by way of bonus sometimes A I see by the wages book that gratuities have been paid to the workmen from time to time I believe by Mellish s order—those gratuities came into the wages book—we employ a number of men from week to week—some of the men would sometimes go off work from illness or other causes Q Have you known when that has been the case and men have supplied their place that the wages were entered to the names of the men gone off work A The wages of the men have been entered to the names of the men during the time of their absence—if four men went off and four others came on I never noticed that the wages were entered to the names of the four men that had gone off work that has not occurred to my knowledge I have not heard of anything of the kind—I do not know that Douglas has been in the habit of advancing wages to the men himself nor that Mellish has—after Mellish had left I remember Douglas calling my attention to deductions in Powell s account I do not recollect to what amount some-where about 20l —there was a mistake of that sort—if he bad not called my attention to it I should have paid it not to him but to Powell s—it was an overcharge—he could not have got the money it would be paid direct from me to Powell—he has not to my recollection called my attention to any other errors as against my employers—I confine my attention solely to the cash and the books MR CLARKSON Q You have been asked about arrangements did you know of anything in the nature of an arrangement either about the two accounts or in respect of the mode of keeping them except what Mellish himself told yon A Certainly not—when I spoke of an arrangement I meant what Mellish told me he should do—it was Mellish s duty to tee that the accounts that were brought to me by Douglas were correct before Douglas brought them COURT Q What was said and by whom as to the initials being put to the accounts before they were paid you say after July and Aug you would not have paid unless Mellish s initials had been put on the bills A Yet for regularity s sake—something was said by me to Mellish on the subject—I cannot recollect what or whether it was by Mr Thompson or myself it was said by one or the other—it was explained to Mellisb that it was for for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of the accounts MR CLARKSON Q Was there any person to your knowledge whose duty it was to see that the accounts Douglas submitted to you were correct before Douglas brought them A Yes Mellish—that was his duty at all times both before and after July hut after July he was required to put his initials indicative of it—I know nothing on the subject of gratuities except what appears in the wages book—if Mellish paid gratuities I should not inquire about them I had no means of knowing whether Mellish or Douglas had paid them except from what appears in the wages book—I never inquired how it happened—my duty was merely to see that they were in the wages book—I know nothing of absent workmen being substituted by others—I always paid Mellish his wages six guineas a week EDWARD VARNISH I live at Hyde-park-villas South Kensington I was at one time in partnership with Mr Frederick Halle Thomson—I was present when Mellish was engaged—I know of the agreement which was afterwards entered into—Dean came some time after Mellish was engaged—I think a wages book was had then for the first time—I am not aware of one before—I have seen Mellish both at the desk and table—I think I have seen the wages book there when Mellish has been there—I have earnestly and anxiously inquired into it and have very little doubt I have seen him with the wages book—I have a doubt about it—I think that it was Mellish s duty decidedly to see that the wages were correctly entered in the wages book because he stipulated to have the whole and sole control over that department—he has not said anything about my interference he has as to Mr Thomson he said he had no business with the workmen the glass cutters if he had any questions to ask he ought to ask them of him Mellish and not of the men and said If I find you interfering with my men any more I will throw up my situation —they were all in-door men—I have seen Mellish at times with a pencil in his hand at the desk drawing different patterns such as were required in the business—I am not positive whether I have seen him with any book before him Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q On many occasions has he had quarrels with Mr Thomson or only once A Two or three times—I recollect Mr Thomson had some machinery erected in the fore part of the house where Mellish had no connection but he accidentally went up and saw it and complained of its being a breach of the engagement with him in giving him the sole control of the business—that was about six weeks or two months before Mellish left he left early in May—I had just joined Mr Thomson in partnership when Mellish came—Mr Thomson was in treaty with him when I entered into partnership and concluded it afterwards—Mr Cookney was in partnership with us at the same time that was about 15th Oct or thereabouts in 1849—Mr Cookney is an attorney—I knew of the patent being taken out by Thomson and Mellish together Mellish as our servant proposed that a certain patent should be taken out I think it was in my name—I can hardly tell when that was—it was before I went that he failed in silvering the inkstands for Mr Lund—I know that Mellish afterwards succeeded in doing so that was in consequence of the glass being inverted in such a way that it presented two surfaces and the solution of silver was put in Mellish at my suggestion tried the experiment and was successful and that was the reason my name was put in—I think some of the inkstands of Mr Lund were done so but I suggested a mustard-pot or cream-jug—Mr Lund had a patent for the inkstands which failed—I think Mellish had an interest in them with Mr Lund—afterwards at my suggestion we found we could put silver on inkstands of this description by making the double glass it was perfected and you may see them to-day—I believe the patent was taken out in my name I am not quite sure—I know nothing of the glass trade—Mellish had no interest in it he carried it out for his master he was not one of the patentees—I think it was in the name of Thomson and Varnish but the patent will show—Mellish may have suggested or carried out something but I do not know that he had any interest in the patent—I never consented to any Q Did you instruct Mr Cookney to ask him to sign a paper relinquishing his interest in the patent A I think it was proposed for the sake of avoiding any future difficulty—I was present when he refused to sign it—Mr Thomson was there and Mr Cookney too it was in Mr Thornton s library—I cannot tell the date I think it had been lying over several weeks before this thing came on the tapis and Mr Mellish went to his house for the paper which he had left at home he brought it back and said he would never sign it for this reason that Mr Cookney s clerk had put it down that in consequence of his poverty he could not carry it out himself—I do not know what was done with the paper I believe Mellish carried it away with him—I do not recollect a second paper being prepared and presented to him or his refusing to sign it or any paper being burned—I recollect Mellish going away from Regent-street—the shop there was kept in the name of Mellish his wife managed the business in consequence of his absence at the glass-works she was always in the shop—she had the shop about a twelve-month—they went away on a Monday—before that I think he bad told me that he had made up his mind that he should leave—he said the business was not managed according to his views he did not see that anything of a profitable nature to him could arise to make it worth his while to stay—I was not present when he said it was too much for his wife s health and his own or when he said anything about sending to Regent-street for a person to take charge of the goods—I did not go on the Monday to take charge of them myself—I cannot recollect going on the Saturday when Mr Thomson was with me—I might have done so—I think the furniture was removed in the course of the Monday—I was there a few minutes Mr Thomson was not there on the Monday I think I went alone on Monday—Mr Thomson has not spoken to me since he was examined about what he said nor has anybody else—I have been outside in Mr Clark s room—I went to Paris two or three times with Mellish the last time was just before Christmas last—we went from Brussels to Paris and were absent a week—the second time was April or May 1850 we were absent rather less than a week because we were never absent on Sunday—the other time was in the year before we went to make purchases of glass—I am not quite positive but I think we went three times we went to the first establishments in Paris—purchases of glass abroad were very small in comparison of purchases of Messrs Powell—I did not transact the business with Messrs Powell they sent in their accounts and were always paid by check of the firm—I went to France the first time to take out a patent there for the double hollow work—I attended at the police-office on two examinations there was a third—I do not think I was at the first—I do not think I was there when Mellish was charged the first time—I was not there when he was allowed to go away on his own recognizances alone Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Do you know where Douglas lived A I know from Mellish that he was to come from Birmingham—he said he knew a young man there who would suit the situation MR BALLANTINE Q Can you tell whether it was after or before the first examination that these receipts were found A No I was quite taken by surprise by Mr Thomson telling me they had been found—that was after the first examination—I attended without a subpoena—I am not a partner now I left on 3rd May—Mellish had no beneficial interest whatever in the patents—we discovered frauds after Mellish left but they were supposed to have been committed before he left—I cannot tell whether any frauds have been discovered committed since he left MR THOMSON re-examined The books have been examined with a view to ascertain whether there have been any frauds committed on our firm since Mellish left and we find that frauds have been committed since in the wages book MR VARNISH re-examined I have seen the accounts in which the alteration of amount is—I believe the alteration in the figures in this account of 14th Sept to be the alteration of Douglas—these second accounts of 27th July and 19th July appear to be in Douglas s writing—he writes a freer hand than Mellish—I hardly know what to say about this one of 17th Aug —the figures are very much like Douglas s but hardly so free as his—my belief is that they are his and this of 30th July also Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Just take the one of 16th Sept in your hand A I know it well without looking at it you have the other bill showing you the correct price—the alteration from one to the other appears to me to be in Douglas s writing because he has a freer hand and less cramped than Mellish—I have not a doubt that these initials T R M are Mellish s—they mean Thomas Robert Mellish Q Look at these initials and look at these figures and I call your particular attention to the ink in which they are written do you still adhere to your belief that the figures are in Douglas s writing A I do I think it is a different ink but the handwriting I am well satisfied with—this 30th July appears to be in the same ink as the T R M and the altered figures—the T R M I have not the slightest doubt is Mellish s signature—the figures I still have my impression are Douglas s—I have had them shown to me before WATKINS I am superintendent of the works at Messrs Thomson and Varnish s Douglas was taken on Saturday 4th Oct and on the Monday afterwards I discovered some vouchers in the boxes in Mellish s private room and others in the table-drawer which was locked—I employed a locksmith to force it—I showed them to Mr Thomson and they were in my possession some time and were handed over to Mr Wakeling—these vouchers were amongst those I found Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Did you mark the papers A No I first emptied a box I put the papers into it again until I had an opportunity of looking at them carefully—the box was opened with a key which Douglas gave up when he was taken—it has been in my possession ever since—I went to the box again the same day to put in the documents which I found in the drawer in the large table—when the box was opened the papers were all carefully sorted—the papers relating to Lee s payments were found in the box MR CLARKSON Q Look at those and tell me whether those are the papers which amongst others were found in the box A Yes I believe they were all found in the box JAMES HENRY KEYS I am in Mr Thomson s employ Mellish was the managing man—my wages were paid me by Mr Douglas at the desk in the office—sometimes he and Mellish were together when I was paid sometimes not—I have seen books on the desk but not very often—I have seen Mellish there when the wages book has been there looking at the wages book along with Mr Douglas—that was usually on a Saturday previous to my being paid my wages before Douglas went for the money—I have seen them looking at the wages book Saturday after Saturday both last year and this—I recollect on one occasion when Douglas was going out of the room Mellish called him back and said Tell Mr Dean I shall want a check for so and so I cannot exactly say the date—I have seen him go on other occasions with the wages book leaving Mellish at the desk and return with the wages book and a bag of money which he would lay on the desk Mellish being there at the time Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Were you examined before the Magistrate A No I was there but was not called—I was about to be dismissed by Mellish last April he said I was too long going into the city—I was afterwards continued up to the present time JOHN BLYTH I am nineteen years old and have been employed at Mr Thomson s sixteen months—I know the wages book—I have seen it on the desk in the office where the prisoners used to sit—I have often seen Mellish looking over it particularly on Saturday before Douglas went to Dean to get the money after he has looked at it Douglas has gone for the money but I never saw Mellish there when Douglas came back—I have teen Mellish looking over the wages book three times—I never heard him ask Douglas any question about it—I have heard Mellish say to Douglas Get 70l of Mr Dean —I have only once heard him name the sum Douglas was to get—Mellish generally went away on Saturday before six o clock or before the men were began to be paid—I have not heard anything pass between him and Douglas on Saturday—as he was about to leave on one Saturday I heard him say Send round word if any thing happens —I used to have to go to Regent-street of a night after I left—Douglas sent me to Mellish with a parcel once after he left on Saturday night —it was about six months ago it was a little parcel Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q You were not examined before the Magistrate A No I am a porter—I can read and write—I do not think Mellish attended to any books I never saw him with any—Douglas had the wages book—I never read it—there used only to be the wages book and book of patterns on the desk—I never sat down at the desk—I used to be about the office MR CLARKSON Q Should you know the wages book if you were to see it A Yes this is it looking at it WILLIAM MITCHELL MOORE I am a glass-cutter I was employed by Mellish he paid me once but generally Douglas paid me on a Saturday—I have only seen this wages book once— the receipts were here read as follows 14th Sept 1850 Varnish and Co to W B Lee four green goblets engraved at 5s 1l Received the above W B LEE —Annexed to the above 16th Sept 1850 Messrs Varnish and Co

t18520405-419  419 CHARLES CLIFFORD feloniously forging and uttering a receipt for 60l with intent to defraud MESSRS CLARXSON and ARCHIBALD conducted the Prosecution JOHN SAUNDERS I am a pay cashier in the London Joint Stock Battle and have been so for twelve or thirteen years I did not know the prisoner before his apprehension—I am aware that he had an account at the bank—I cannot say when it was opened—it is usual to give a pass book to customers—this produced is the prisoner s pass book—this check produced was presented to me at the bank on 4th Dec 1851—I paid it—I did not look at the prisoner s account before I paid it—I did afterwards when it was reported to me in the evening that the account was overdrawn by the payment of this check I found only 5s 5d to his credit—I reported that to the manager of the bank—I was cashier at the bank in 1850—I never received a sum of 60l from the prisoner in Oct or Sept —I never under any circumstances received any money from the prisoner or any person sent by him—here is an entry in this pass book on the credit side on 1st Oct 1850 of cash 60l —that is not my writing—to the best of my belief it is not the handwriting of any clerk in the bank—that is the last entry on the credit side—no cashier in the bank has left since 1850 Prisoner Q Have any of the cashiers died since 1850 A I believe not I am certain of it—there are about nine persons acting as cashiers—r am familiarly acquainted with them—I did not receive 60l on 28th or 30th Sept —I am not aware that there have been any complaints made as to any errors in the entries in the ledger about the end of Sept or beginning of Oct —I cannot remember whether any of the ledger keepers have left the bank since Sept or Oct —it has never been known that a cashier has willingly or knowingly made a false entry in any pass book since I have been there—no clerk has been dismissed since Sept 1850—I have no knowledge of the handwriting in which this entry of 60l is made—there is an entry of 15l on 26th Sept 1850—that is the writing of Mr John Burton COURT Q Is that the entry immediately preceding A Yes he is now a cashier—at that time he was a ledger keeper—it is not my duty to receive only to pay—when money is received the entry of it in the pass book is not always made by the clerk who receives it in fact that is the exception—if the customer wishes it entered in the pass book at the time that is done by the clerk who receives it but if the book Is left the entry is made by the ledger keeper—the cashier and the ledger keeper are the only persons authorised to make entries in the pass book Prisoner Q Is the entry of the 15l made by the ledger keep Q Yes I did not see the pass book in the house at the end of Sept or any time during Oct 1850—I have nothing to do with the pass books and therefore cannot tell whether your pass book was asked for in Oct —there is no writing of mine in this pass book—when a customer pays in money it is put into the till and the pass book is left and made up by the ledger keeper—if the money paid in is notes they could be folded up and pinned together and the name of the party paying them in would be written on them—I did not know your person COURT Q You say you paid this check inadvertently A Yes bankers do allow customers to overdraw their accounts—I have sometimes paid checks under such circumstances by express permission this was paid in error JOSEPH HALL I am a solicitor of 28 Moorgate-street On 4th or 5th March last the prisoner called on me at my chambers on business—he asked me if I would allow my son to leave his pass book at the London Joint Stock Bank—I said Certainly and sent him with it—I believe this is the book—I never bad it in my hand but it is like it Prisoner Q How many times have you seen me for the last two or three months previous to my being taken into custody A Perhaps two or three times in a week—I had no difficulty in finding you when I wanted you I have seen you about the Exchange when I have passed that way—I did not know where you lived—when I have asked for you I hare heard of you—I have seen you above perhaps two or three times within the last month before you were taken—I never knew any actions brought against you for debt I brought an action for you once and I have written two or three letters for you MR CLARKSON Q Was his place of business called the Hall of Commerce A Yes he was a share dealer JAMES EDMUND HALL I am a son of last witness On 4th or 5th March j took the prisoner s pass book for him to the London Joint-Stock Bank—he did not assign any reason to me why he could not take it himself JOHN LEWIS PATON I am a cashier in the London Joint Stock Bank This check produced was presented there on 11th March by a woman and was refused the account being previously overpaid to the extent of nearly 12l —I had compared the pass book with the account before this check was presented—no complaint was ever made by the prisoner that any money was omitted in his account—I did not receive 60l from him in Oct 1850—this entry of 60l in the pass book is not my writing nor to the best of my knowledge is it the writing of any clerk cashier or ledger keeper in the house—I have been a cashier between eleven and twelve years Prisoner Q Did you ever receive any cash from me A Not to my knowledge not at any time—I have no knowledge of seeing your pass-book about the end of Sept or beginning of Oct 1850 I know nothing of its having been inquired for—there is no writing of mine in it—I cannot say in whose writing this entry of 15l is—I do not think that any clerks have been dismissed since I have been in the bank—I have no idea how many have left—some have left within the last eighteen months—I do not know the handwriting of all the clerks in the bank—no clerk baa been taken up for any fraud committed in the bank since I have been there—no clerk has ever been known to keep back the pass book of a customer—I am not prepared to say who made up your pass book in 1850—there appear to be several checks entered at the beginning of 1850—the checks are invariably returned to the customer with the pass book—I do not know how many checks we have of yours ROBERT ALEXANDER BENTHAM I am assistant to Mr Pollard the manager of the bank This produced is the form of letter written to customers whose accounts are overdrawn—about 5th Dec 1851 1 became acquainted with the fact that the prisoner s account had been overdrawn in consequence of that I went to make inquiries after him among other place I went to the Hall of Commerce—that is the place to which he referred—I could learn nothing of him there—I also went to the Auction Mart and to Garraways to inquire after him—I hardly know what he was but he was generally about the Stock Exchange—I made inquiries about him altogether for about two months from time to time but could learn nothing of him—I could not obtain his address—he has a brother—on 11th Dec I gave this letter to him for the prisoner—I applied to the messenger at the Hall of Commerce for his address but could not learn it—I saw the prisoner s brother after I had given him the letter and he told me what he had done with it—I never heard of any complaint made by the prisoner that 60l had not been entered to his credit or that he had 60l credited which had not been drawn I never heard any such suggestion Prisoner Q What situation did you hold in the bank in 1850 A The same as I do now I had nothing to do with the pass books—I did not receive any cash over the counter that I am aware of I cannot say positively because if I saw anybody waiting probably I should come forward—if I did receive any I put it to the account of the person who paid it in—if required I should enter it in the pass book at the time it is very often required—sometimes the customer takes the pass book away with him and sometimes be leaves it—money is often paid in by one person to the account of another—I do not make up the pass* books—I do not know whose handwriting this pass book is last made up—I know the handwriting of very nearly all the clerks those who have been there seven years certainly—one or two clerks have left in the last two years perhaps more—I know their writing—I believe this entry of the 60l is not the writing of any clerk in our house—is not the writing of any person I know—I do not recollect any mistake similar to this occurring since I have been in the bank—a sum may appear is a pass book which has been questioned but this was twelve months before it was questioned—there may have been a complaint by a customer that money has been paid in on his account and not credited to him—I do not recollect any charge of dishonesty against any clerk since I have been there—I never recollect taking any money of you—I am not aware that I have ever seen you in the house MR CLARKSON Q Have you ever received any money either from him or any other customer which you have not made a proper entry of after placing it in the till A Never we are not always free from errors but no error of the kind alleged has been a month without being pointed out and corrected JAMES JOHN AMOS I am clerk to Messrs Tilson solicitors to the London Joint Stoke Bank In consequence of instructions I issued a plaint against the prisoner on 13th Jan last for 11l 14s 9l the balance of an overdrawn banking account—it was given to the officer of the Sheriffs Court in London to serve—I afterwards applied to the officer who said he could not serve it—I afterwards made inquiries for the prisoner at the Hall of Commerce and in the neighbourhood but could not hear of him and they could not give me bis address Prisoner Q Where did you inquire after me A I inquired of one or two persons in the neighbourhood of the Hall and of the messenger—the persons I asked said they did not know you—the messenger said I believe be is a member that is I believe his subscription has not yet expired but I have not seen him here for some months —I did not ask the secretary to look in the book for your address—I did not inquire for you anywhere except at the Hall of Commerce because they told me you had no place of business you were only a member of the New Stock Exchange not then existing—the summons was never served on you we could not find you WILLIAM EDWARD HARRINGTON I am a receiving cashier in the London Joint Stock Bank This entry in the pass book of 60l on 1st March 1850 is not my writing—it is not the writing of any cashier or ledger keeper in the bank that I know of—I did not receive that or any sum to the prisoner s credit on 1st Oct 1850 Prisoner Q Did you on 80th Sept receive any cash from me or on my account A No I do not recollect seeing you at the bank at all—I have been there ten years and three quarters—there is no writing of mine in this pass book—I do not know when I last saw this book in the bank—tow entry of 15l is Mr Burton s writing—I occasionally make up the pass books—i did not do so about that date—we have an accountant in the bank—I have no knowledge of any inquiry after your pass book in 1850—I do not know the writing of every clerk in the house MR CLARKSON Q Do you know the handwriting of the receiving cashiers A Yes and the paying cashiers also this entry is not the writing of any of them—the cashier s books are made up every night—an error of 60l would be detected at once WILLIAM EDWARD HAMILTON I am a clerk in the London Joint Stock Bank These three entries on the debit side of the pass book of 10l 5l and 12l were made by me on or about Tuesday 9th March 1852—I made them from the checks themselves—they were given to me to enter in the book—if the book had been in the bank the entries would have been made at the checks were paid Prisoner Q When did you enter the 15l A I did not make that entry I have only been six weeks in the bank HENRY THRUPP I am a ledger keeper in the London Joint Stock Bank I kept the book containing the prisoner s account producing it —it is my duty to agree the pass book with the ledger—I made up the prisoner s pass book from this account in the ledger—there is no entry in the ledger of 60l to the prisoner s credit—the other entries correspond with the pass book—a tick is placed against each item as it is agreed both on the credit and debit side—then money is paid in and the pass book is produced it is entered at the time if the party wishes it—this entry of 1st Oct in the pass book is not my writing I do not know whose it is—I should say it is not the writing of any clerk in the bank—I am quite sure it is not the writing of any cashier or ledger keeper—I discovered this entry of the 60l directly I opened the pass book—I was in the bank on 30th Sept 1850—I did not receive any sum of 60l I never received any money at all—I have never been a cashier Prisoner Q Have you any knowledge of having seen me in the bank A No I do not recollect your pass book being asked for in Oct 1850—this entry of 15l is Mr Burton s writing—that was paid in on 26th Sept 1850—that appears in the ledger—I cannot say whether the pass book was left with it at the time I should say not from the circumstance of the entry being in the ledger keeper s writing—if entered at the time it would he in the cashier s writing—there are one or two ledger keepers who occasionally assist in taking cash on busy days—no one has a right to make an entry in a pass hook but a cashier or ledger keeper—I cannot tell bow many clerks have lift the bank in the last two years probably six or seven—they left of their own accord—no cashier or ledger keeper has left—none of the clerks who hive left attended at the counter on busy days—we have three cheeks of yours in our possession MR CLARKSON Q You see some entries on the credit side of the pass book of 10l 5l and 12l A Yes from those entries not being made until 9th March last and the payments being in 1850 it would indicate that the pass book was with the customer in the interval and not with us—I had no idea that the pass book was in the bank till it was brought by young Mr Holl on 4th or 5th March last JOHN BURTON I was one of the ledger keepers in the London Joint Stock Bank in the autumn of 1850 I kept the prisoner s account at that time—this entry of Cash 15l in the pass book on 26th Sept is my writing—I cannot tell when this pass book last came into my hand—it was some time between 26th Sept and the end of the year 1850—I know that because the book is not balanced and if it had been in the house at the end of 1850 it would have been balanced—if the pass book is left one day it is our practice to make it up the next—the fact of the three entries not being made till 9th March 1852 show most positively that the book had not been in the bank till that time—they would be put into the pass book from the ledger as a matter of course—such an omission would be almost impossible—it it usual to balance our books half-yearly and this was not balanced either in 1860 or 1851—I am now one of the receiving cashiers—this entry on the debit side of the pass book of 60l on Oct 1st 1850 is not my writing—I received no such sums from the prisoner or from anybody on his account on or about that date or at all—it is not the handwriting of any clerk in the bank of whom I have any knowledge—it is not the handwriting of any cashier or ledger keeper—all the same cashiers are now in the bank that were there in 1850—if a customer desired a cash payment to be entered at the time it would be done by the cashier if not by the ledger keeper next day—there are sewn receiving cashiers besides myself—they are all here—I have looked through the books and find no entry of 60l about that time to the prisoner s credit Prisoner Q Did you ever receive money of me A No I never saw you till you were in custody to my knowledge—this entry of 15l is my writing I cannot say when I made it—I was a ledger keeper at that time—it was not customary at that time for a ledger keeper to receive cash of a customer over the counter—I was appointed an assistant receiving cashier in 1850—I did not receive the 15l over the counter I am quite sure of that—I do not know the handwriting of the entry of the 60l —I did not see the pass book this year before I saw it at the Mansion-house—I know of no inquiry being made after your passbook in Oct 1850—I cannot say how often this pass book was made up in 1849 and 1850 I cannot say how many clerks have left in the last two years—none have been dismissed on any charge of embezzlement or making false entries—no cashier has left—I think one ledger keeper has his name was Barker he left of his own accord—the entry in question is not his writing—I swear that—it is not the writing of any person I am acquainted with in or out of the bank—any clerk in the house can have access to the pass books—I have no knowledge of a pass book being misplaced and not able to be found JOHN COOTS STURT I am the chief receiving cashier at the London Joint Stock Bank I have searched the books to ascertain by whom money was received at the end of Sept and the 1st Oct 1850—the names of the receiving cashiers are Mr Stoke Mr Widdle Mr Harrington Mr Rackstraw Mr Legg myself and Mr Gibbon—I did not at the end of Sept or on 1st Oct 1850 receive 60l of the prisoner or on his account—the entry of the 60l in the pass book is not my writing or the writing of any of the gentlemen I have mentioned—to the best of my belief it is not the writing of any clerk in the bank—certainly not of any cashier nor of any ledger keeper to my knowledge Prisoner Q Have you ever received any money of me A I should say I have very often—I am acquainted with you as a customer and have a strong recollection of having done business with you several times—I have no recollection of receiving such a sum as 60l from you—this entry of 15l is in Mr Burton s writing—I have no knowledge of your asking me for your pan book about Oct —I have no recollection of seeing you in the house about that time—no clerk in the house asked me if I had seen your pass book about that time—I have no knowledge of seeing it it was not in my department HENRY RACKSTRAW I am a cashier in the London Joint Stock Bank I did not at the end of Sept or 1st Oct 1850 receive 60l of the prisoner or on his account—this entry of 60l in the pass book is not my writing—I is not the writing of any of the cashiers or of anybody that I know Prisoner Q Did you ever receive any money of me or on my account A No I never saw you before to-day to my recollection—I bad been a cashier about five years in 1850—I do not recollect ever taking your pass book from you at the counter—I have no knowledge of any one asking me for your pass book—I do not know the handwriting of all the clerks I do of all the cashiers not of all the ledger keepers—clerks are sometimes called to attend at the counter when there is a good deal of business going on—that it done by the chief cashier it is generally the ledger keepers who are called—I cannot tell how many ledger keepers have left in the last two years or year and a half more than four or five—if a customer comes and pays in cash it is put into a box and he enters it in the counter book and next morning it is entered in the pass book by the ledger keeper it is sometimes entered at the time if the customer requires it—I do not know the handwriting of all the clerks in the bank MR CLARKSON Q Has there been any ledger keeper dismissed on any charge of fraud or other misconduct during the last year and a half A No I cannot enumerate the names of the ledger keepers in Oct 1850—I should lay to the best of my recollection about six or seven of them have left—Risden is one and Barker Cooper Holly comb and Lyon—Lyon has been gone about five years COURT Q You cannot have attended to the question you were asked whether any ledger keepers bad left within the last year and a half A Barker has left recently and Risden I do not recollect any others MR CLARKSON Q When did Risden leave A He died about Sept this entry in the pass book is not his writing or Barker s I am quite certain of that THOMAS STOKES I am a cashier in the London Joint Stock Bank I see this entry of 60l in the prisoner s pass book to his credit—I received 60l about that time but not on the prisoner s account—this entry is not my writing I cannot identify it as the writing of any cashier ledger keeper or clerk in the house—it is not the handwriting of any person I know Prisoner Q Who did you receive the 60l from A It was on account of gentleman named Gold—it was paid in checks and notes I think 30l In checks and 30l in notes referring to the cash book —it was a check of 80l and 30l in notes on 1st Oct to the credit of Mr George Gold—I cannot from memory say whether I have received any money from you on your account—I cannot recognise you as a customer—this entry of 15l in the past book is Mr Burton s writing—I cannot tell you whether he received the money over the counter I should say not by its being in his handwriting—the ledger keepers do occasionally receive money over the counter on press of business—I am quite sure the 60l entry is not the writing of any one in the house or of any one that I know—I have no recollection of being asked for this or any pass book in Oct 1850 or of saying J could not find it but I could not say for certainty at such a distance on time—when the pass books are completed we have a particular place for them and when they are not—complete they are put in a rack immediately behind the cashier—it may be put into a drawer or somewhere by mistake—I have no knowledge of such a thing happening about Oct 1850—I should not have identified you as a customer—when a customer pays in money if he wishes it it is entered in his pass book at the time by the cashier be puts the notes in one drawer the cash in another and the checks he hands behind to a clerk who enters them and the pass book is put on the counter to be made up MR CLARKSON Q How long have you been in the bank A Nearly fourteen years I never received any money from the prisoner or anybody else without making an entry of it MR GIBBON I am one of the cashiers of the London Joint-Stock Bank Here is an entry in this pass hook of 60l to the prisoner s credit—it is not in my writing nor to my knowledge in that of any of the clerks—I do not know whose writing it is—I received no such sum in Sept or Oct 1850 Prisoner Q Have you ever seen me in the house A No I have been there seventeen years—no inquiries have been made for this pass book to my knowledge—I do not know that I ever saw it before I came here—I do not know the writing of all the clerks in the house—I know the writing of all the cashiers I should say this is not in the writing of any of them—I cannot say whether it is in the writing of any of the ledger keepers—it is writing which I never saw before—I was cashier in 1850—I cannot say whether I received any money for this account—I do not know how many clerks have left the bank in the last year and a half—ledger keepers occasionally assist at the counter they receive money—I never received a sum of 60l about this date of any one—I first heard about the 60l in the past book just before your apprehension—no inquiry about it was made of the clerk the manager said nothing to me about it—the manager would be made acquainted with such a case as this undoubtedly but I do not know that he was—I see no writing of mine in this book—I can fix upon the names of the clerks who wrote particular sums in it—I know the writing of the first sum but cannot at this moment remember the clerk s name—I am prepared to swear they are all written by clerks in the employ of the bank except the entry of 1st Oct which is in quite a strange hand I do not know it at all RICHARD WILLIAM LEGO I am a cashier in the London Joint Stock Bank This entry of 60l in this pass book on 1st Oct is not in my writing and I believe it is not in that of any of the clerks or ledger keepers in the bank Prisoner Q How long have you been there A About fourteen years I do not remember seeing you at the counter except when you were apprehended—I do not remember receiving any cash from you—J do not know any person whose writing this 60l is like—I have been cashier about six years—the senior cashier asked us if we knew the writing—I presume every* body was asked—if there is any mistake between the customer and the bank it is made known to the manager immediately—this case was made known to the manager I do not know who by—this balance is brought forward in the writing of Burton the ledger keeper—he was not acting as cashier on 25tb or 26th Sept —in some cases an amount is entered in the morning as haying been paid in on the day previous if the pass book is in—a ledger keeper named Barker has left within the last month—I know the handwriting of all the clerks in the house but do not know this writing at all—I knew Risden before he died—it is not his writing COURT Q About how many clerks does the establishment consist of including cashiers A 75 I know the writing of them all tolerably well—I do not believe this to be the writing of any of them or of any who have left MR WIDDLE I am one of the cashiers of the London Joint Stock Bank—I see this entry of 60l in the pass book on 1st Oct —I received no sum at all from the prisoner about that time—I received 60l on 2nd Oct from John Wilson—this entry is not my writing I do not know it Prisoner Q Whose handwriting is this 15l in A Mr Burton s a ledger keeper—it was made on 26th Sep 1850—he did not act occasionally as cashier at the counter—I am quite sure of that—if money was paid in this afternoon it would be entered by the ledger keeper the following morning—the date inserted is the true date not the date of the entry—I believe this 40l On 21st Aug 1848 on the debit aide to be my writing—I know the writing of all the clerks who were in the bank up to the time in question —I can speak to the names of the clerks who made most of the entries on the credit side but some of the writing on the debit side I cannot speak to—I never received my money from you—I do not recollect making any entry at all for your account—I know that such a person had an account there—I do not know of toy check being presented for payment when there were not sufficient funds—I do not remember receiving instructions not to pay a check of yours—there might possibly have been such instructions about a month back or about the time the account was first overdrawn—I cannot say whether there had always been sufficient funds to meet your checks previous to that—half a dozen clerks may have left in the last two or three years—they have left of their own accord—I do not recollect their handwriting well—they were not my of them cashiers there was one ledger keeper Walter Barker and one has gone to keep the private ledger he had nothing to do with customers accounts MAST EAST I am the wife of John East of Grange-rood Bermondsey The prisoner and his family lodged at our house about four months as near as I can say—he paid one month s rent and 10s off the second month—I have applied to him for money from time to time but have not been able to get any more Prisoner Q Who took the lodging A Mrs Clifford she ha promised to pay several times—you had six children living with you EDWARD FUNNELL City policeman 32 I am one of the detective police—On Thursday afternoon 11th March I was sent for to the London Joint Stock Bank—I went to Mr Pollard s room—a female was brought in about a minute afterwards—this cheek of 11th March for 15l was produced in her presence and in consequence of something that passed between her and the manager I went with her in a cab to go to the prisoner s lodgings—as we went down Duke-street Tooley-street she pointed and said There is my husband waiting for me —I saw the prisoner waiting there got out of the cab and told him I was a police-officer and Wanted him to go the London Joint Stock Bank with me through a check which he had sent his wife there with and told him he had overdrawn his account—he said it was a mistake he would go with me and see Mr Pollard and he would pretty soon set that light—I allowed the female to go home and went back to the bank with the prisoner—Mr Forster the chairman of directors said to him You have sent a 15l check here and you have already overdrawn —he said he bad not—Mr Foster asked him if he had not bad a letter to that effect—he said he bad received a letter took this letter produced from hit pocket-book and banded it to the chairman who read it to him and asked him if to did not think that required a little attention—he said he complained of the way in which he had received it stating that he received it from his brother who was on bad terms with him and had been for two years—the pass book Was lying on the table but was not opened—the prisoner said it was quite right he paid the money in himself—he was asked to whom—he said he did not know which of the clerks he paid it to—he was then given into my custody—he was asked how many days the pass book had been brought into the bank—he said he thought about Friday by Mr Hall s son—he was asked about the payment of the money—he said that required a little recollection —he stood about a minute hesitating but said no more—I took him to the station went to Mrs East s in Grange-road and found Mrs Clifford and six children—they appeared to be in great distress—there was a bed in the front room on the floor and a little bed in the back room—on 15th March I went again and found seventy-three duplicates for wearing apparel of every description some as low as 6d and some as high as 1l 15s which appeared to have been accumulating since 1850—here are ten in Oct last two in Sept and up to the present time Prisoner Q Did Mr Forster ask me how long after the letter had been delivered to my brother I received it A I do not recollect your wife handed the duplicates to me in Mrs East s presence—a great many of them are in your name but not all The check was here read it was for 15l payable to Mr East or bearer dated 11th March 1852 signed Charles Clifford Letter read— London Joint Stock Bank 11th Dec 1851 Charles Clifford Esq Sir —As your account appears to be overdrawn I think it right to call your attention to the fact in order that any error on your part with the bank may be rectified Signed GEORGE POLLARD manager MR BENTHAM I know Mr Forster—his name is George Oldgate Forster—he is one of the proprietors of the London Joint Stock Bank—we find no entry of this sum in the cash-book ledger or waste-book WILLIAM COUTTON I am a tavern keeper The prisoner was a tenant of mine six years from 1845 I think to 1851—before April 1851 there was three quarters rent due to me—he pledged some things to pay me one quarter and gave me a memorandum to pay the rest before 26th June following—I never received the other two quarters though I made repeated applications to him—he told me he had no means to pay it and could not promise when he should ENOCH RICHARD I am potman to Mr Southam of the Kent-road In 1850 and 1851 I supplied the prisoner with beer—he owes me for beer and spirits 2l 8s or 2l 9s —I have made repeated applications to him without being able to get it—I pay the landlord for the beer I take out—it is my loss MILLS I am a butcher In 1851 I supplied the prisoner with meat he owes me 5l or 6l I have applied to him but have not been able to get it Prisoner Q How long have you served me A About four years previous to the bill running up which has been eighteen months or two years—the bills were paid regularly before that I never had to send to the house for a bill before this—you used to come to my shop occasionally and pay me once a week—your wife came first to order meat—you never ordered any before which you did not pay for—you have never been to the shop to order any of the meat contained in this bill MR CLARKSON Q Have you ever applied to him for payment of this bill A Yes and he has said he would pay me as soon as he could—he never denied owing me the debt Prisoner s Defence I am charged with knowingly uttering a forged accountable receipt with intent to defraud this bank which I most solemnly declare to be false placed as I am it is not in my power to produce any witness but you must be well aware that any man having an account at a bank and paying money in has no receipt or anything to show for it the bank clerks have sworn positively that they never received the 60l I positively swear that I paid it in on 30th Sept or 1st Oct in four 10l -notes and twenty sovereigns I had no occasion after that to draw any check till the Nov following when I drew one for 10l and another for 5l my passbook was left at the bank at the time the money was paid in I called for It four or live days after and was told by the clerk that it had not been seen for long time I said Nonsense I left it with the money the other day lie went to the back part of the bank returned to me again and said I have had some difficulty in finding your pass-book it is not ready it has been misplaced I called for it about a week or a fortnight after and it was never sent to the bank again till March last as I had been doing no business and had no occasion to draw checks and therefore I made no complaint to the house as to there being anything wrong in respect of the 60l I had no notion of there being anything wrong in the book the prosecutors have raked up things against me which have nothing to do with the case as to the duplicates some of the things were very likely pledged with my knowledge hot the bulk of them were not as to the money haying been paid into the bankers I solemnly declare I paid it in myself if it was the last word I had to utter if such evidence as this is taken no man is safe I have always paid 20s in the pound I never took the benefit of the Act or been a bankrupt or compromised for 5s or 2s 6d in the pound though unfortunately others have done it too much towards me GUILTY Aged 45 Strongly recommended to mercy by the Jury in consequence of his poverty — Transported for Seven Years 
t18520510-478  478 WILLIAM CLEMENTS was indicted for feloniously forging and uttering an order for payment of 10l 10s with intent to defraud MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM ROBERTSON I live at 130 Aldersgate-street—my nephew is a baker there On 17th March the prisoner came to my house with a check between 6 and a quarter before 7 o clock—he said he came from Mr Rutherford a baker in Barbican and he wanted change for the check—he said it was for a very particular customer and Mr Rutherford would be very much obliged to me if I would change it—this is the check produced —it is dated 17th March 1852 for 10l 10s drawn by Thomas Cureton on Messrs Praed and Co —my housekeeper was in my shop at the time—I saw her take the check out of the prisoner s band and she handed it to me—I took it in the parlour looked at it and brought it in the shop and told him Mr Rutherford ought to put his name to it—he said Mr Rutherford would have put his name but he was not certain that I had the cash—I went up stairs and brought down nine sovereigns two halt sovereigns and 10s in silver and gave him the ten guineas for it—I sent it to the bankers —the prisoner was dressed as a baker with a flannel jacket and a white night cap such as bakers generally wear and his face was dabbed with flour as if he had left work without washing himself—I took particular notice of him because I thought I might know him being a baker—I had not seen him before—I saw him afterwards when I went with the officer to his lodging—he came down in his shirt sleeves—I identified him—the 17th was on a Wednesday and I think it was on the Thursday week following that I saw him again—I had given a description of him before I saw him again—the officer called on me and I gave him a description of him Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q How soon afterwards did you give a description to the policeman A It was several days after—I did not keep an account of the time—I sent the check to the bankers the next morning—there was only my housekeeper in the shop when the prisoner first came—I was in the bakehouse—I do not remember having seen him before—I did not see him again till I was taken by the policeman to his lodging—he then had black trowsers on and he was in his shirt sleeves as far as I can recollect—I could not see what trowsers the person had on who brought the cheek the counter was between him and me—I saw his jacket and I took particular notice of the man—when he was taken he went and dressed himself—he then had on a black coat—his dress did not correspond in any respect with the dress the person had on in my shop—I took particular notice of his features—I have not the least doubt that the prisoner is the man—I looked particularly at the man to see if I knew him—I did not say on another occasion that I thought the prisoner was the person who presented the check MR PATNE Q Looking at him now what do you say A I am certain he is the man ANN WILSON I am housekeeper to Mr Robertson I remember being in his shop on 17th March—the prisoner came in with a check and asked if Mr Robertson could oblige Mr Rutherford in Barbican with change for it—Mr Robertson was not in the shop—he came in and I gave him the check—he said Mr Rutherford ought to have put his name on the back—the prisoner said Mr Rutherford would have done so but he was not sure that he had got the change for it—Mr Robertson went up stairs and brought the money down—I saw him give it to the prisoner—the person was dressed as a baker with a flannel jacket and a nightcap—the prisoner is the person Cross-examined Q He had a nightcap A Yes and light trowsers all flour dust and his face and all—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—I never saw him again till I saw him at the station—I recognized him directly PETER HENDERSON I am a master baker in Pitfield-street Hoxton The prisoner was in my employ—I have seen him write—to the best of my belief this check is his writing Cross-examined Q How long is it since the prisoner was in your service A On Christmas Eve 1846—since then he has been out of my employ—he was about three months in my employ—he came into my employ in the middle of Sept —it is three or four years or perhaps five years since I saw him—he had to serve a few customers and I saw him keep memorandums and I received a letter from him in March 1847—I cannot find that letter—I do not swear positively to this check being his writing—I simply say I believe it to be his writing—there were reasons which induced me to watch him narrowly when he was with not—I took notice of everything about him and there was a stiffness about his writing—he was very fond of writing almost every day he was borrowing an inkstand and pen—I am induced to say this is his writing from the stiffness of the character and the general appearance of it—there is a particular thickness about the down strokes and a thinness about the up strokes GEORGE EVANS I know the prisoner very well—I have seen him write and know his handwriting—I swear to the best of my belief this check is his writing Cross-examined Q What are you A lam at present out of business—I did keep a beer house—I have been out of it about four months—I was in it two years and a half—the prisoner was a customer to me about twelve months off and on—his brother had a raffle at my house and his brother not being able to write so well as him he got him to write a great many names down which I saw him do and another time there was a little bit of a dispute between him and me and he said Give me the pen and ink and I will put it down —he put down figures and writing—I have not it in my possession now—I cannot tell what became of the raffle paper—he wrote twenty or thirty names at different times—there is a peculiarity in his writing—this word self is peculiar—his writing is one that I could recollect—there is a peculiar character in the letters and a stiffness in it—I never saw Mr Henderson before to-day—we have had some talk about this trial—we were not looking at this check outside the door—I never saw it before—I told him there was a peculiar stiffness in the prisoner s writing WILLIAM SMITH City-policeman I got a description from Mr Robertson of the person who uttered the check and I took Mr Robertson to 5 Eagle-court in the Strand which is the residence of the prisoner—this was on a Thursday I believe it was a week and a day after the check was uttered—I knocked at the door—there was glass in the door and I saw the prisoner turn and go up stairs—I went to the side door which was open—I went in and saw a female in bed on the ground floor—I asked if John Clements was in—she said No he has been gone out about an hour —I said I wish to see him —she said If you call in about an hour perhaps you may see him —I said No I wish to see him now it is on business very important —I asked her to give me a light and she gave me one—I went down in the cellar and looked over some dirty things and found this flannel jacket—I then went up to the first floor I found nothing there—I went up to the third floor and found two females in the room one of them refused to let me in—I told her I must come—I went in and saw the prisoner in bed covered with bedclothes and this pair of trowsers was lying outside the bed—I told him to get up there was a gentleman wished to see him—he said he would be d—if he would get up for me or any one else and he wanted to know what gentleman it was—at last he came down—he put on these trowsers at first—he asked me to allow him to wash himself and he did—he then put on a pair of black trowsers and a black coat and waistcoat—I took him down and took him outside the house Mr Robertson saw him and said That is the man —when I first saw this flannel jacket it was in the cellar—when I had taken the prisoner I looked for it again and it was not there—I afterwards found it in a cupboard behind the door on the second floor Cross-examined Q Were you in uniform A No he knew me—I did not tell him I had a charge against him for uttering a forged check—I induced him to go down to see a gentleman—when I took him down and he was identified I told him what the charge was—he said I don t know anything at all about it —I left him in charge of another officer to whom he made some resistance—he denied that the other jacket and trowsers were his property THOMAS PEATY policeman K 107 I received the prisoner from the last witness—the prisoner struck me and said he would run a knife through me and give me a crack over the bead with the poker he struck me three times and tried to get away—I was down another constable came to my assistance Cross-examined Q Were you outside waiting with Mr Robertson A Yes the prisoner was brought down—I was in the hall while the search was going on—there was a fireplace and a fire—I did not take the prisoner by the neck till he ran at me—he said it was unnecessary for me to treat him in that manner but I never used any violence to him MR PAYNE Q Did you lay hold of him till he made an attempt to get away A No he was going out and I laid hold of him and then it was that he said he would give me a crack of the head HENRY OSBORNE CURETON I live at Pentonville I was formerly in business in Aldersgate-street I do not know any person of my name living about there—there is no Mr Cureton a baker there—I have not any account at Praed s the bankers and never had—I never saw the prisoner till he was at Guildhall WILLIAMWILSON BARN I am clerk to Messrs Praed s No person of the name on this check keeps an account at our house JAMES RUTHERFORD I am a baker in Barbican I never gave the prisoner this check to get change for me—I have heard of the name of Thomas Cureton in Aldersgate though I was not known personally to him there is no other Mr Rutherford a baker in Barbican Cross-examined Q Have you many persons in your employ A I have two men and a boy—one man has been with me twenty years the other about six months—there are not two other bakers shops in Barbican—there is one in Beech-street kept by a very respectable man—I think he keeps three or four men—I am not aware that his men are personally acquainted with the men in my employ—I am not aware that journeymen bakers meet at a house in my neighbourhood GUILTY The prisoner was further charged with having been twice before convicted JOSEPH COOTE policeman N 170 I produce two certificates which I received at Mr Clark s office—read—Central Criminal Court Jan 4 1847 John Clements convicted of embezzlement and confined three months August

t18520510-523  523 JEAN JEROME EXUPERE EDWARD BREQUE feloniously forging and uttering an order for the payment of 42l 10s 6d with intent to defraud MESSRS BALLANTINE and PARRY conducted the Prosecution JOHN JACOB SCHWEITZER I am a varnish manufacturer and live at 28 Poole-street New North-road The prisoner was in my service up to 17th Jan 1852 when I discharged him—he had been with me under an agreement from 20th Jan 1851—it was an agreement for a year—his position was as clerk and traveller when required—he understood English very well—he is a native of France—it was his duty to correspond with some of my French customers—on 20th Dec 1851 I left home with Mrs Schweitzer about half past 4 o clock in the afternoon I was going out with her—before leaving I told the prisoner that two letters would come in during the day and they were to be answered by return of post one was from an agent of mine named Fellme in Paris and the other from a customer named Audient of Verdun—I gave him on rough paper a sketch of what was to be the purport of the reply—I intended to remain until he had completed the letters but my wife came in just at the time these directions were given she beard part of them and she urged me to go out—I said I cannot go at this moment because the foreign post is not off —she said Is there much to do —I said No not particular except letters and the instructions are already detailed —she said Can you not sign them at the bottom and be off and at her instance I committed this nonsense I put my name to the bottom of the two papers in blank—this produced I believe to be one of the half sheets of paper I so signed—it was a similar paper to this—I signed two blank sheets and directed the prisoner to fill them up with the letters to my correspondents—I then went out with my wife—I returned about six in the evening—I saw the prisoner I asked him whether he had dispatched the letters in time for the post of that day—he said he had—his pay was up that day he asked for it and I gave it him—it was 4l 6s 8d his salary was 52l a year—I did not authorise him to write this letter—the body of it is his writing the signature is my own it is addressed to my bankers at Rouen Messrs Jullien—the prisoner was aware that I did business with them—I remember saying at the police court that I did business with them and that the prisoner was aware of it upon which he said You need not call that witness I have had the money and I can account for it —this is the letter— translating it— London 11th Feb 1852 to Messrs J B Jullien bankers Rouen We acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th of the current month which replied to mine of the 5th the traveller Mr Breque will find himself in your town to-morrow or the day after and we shall feel obliged to you to count him over the sum of 42l 10s 6d calculated at the exchange of that day in your town in French money this sum is due to him by us by way of settlement of accounts if in case you have not this sum to our credit in cash of which to cover yourselves with if you can count him the sum over on the bills which will become due to our credit the present with his receipt which we beg you will ask of him will serve you as a guarantee as you do not know the person if you require it you may accompany him to Mr Foubert a solicitor in your town who will recognise him and in case you should not pay him this sum oblige by letting him have this letter back receive our salutations &c —here follows I O U the sum of 42l 10s 6d 11th Feb 1852 —that is in English and then comes my signature—that is a correct translation—the prisoner s year was up in Jan —he had left my service at the date which the letter bears—this envelope bears the post mark of 11th Feb —the direction is in the prisoner s writing as well as the letter—I afterwards received information in consequence of which I went to Paris and to my agent there Mr Fellme—I did not go to Mr Oudinet at Verdun but I have a letter from him—in consequence of the inquiries I made I got these two letters one from Paris and the other from Verdun in the prisoner s writing which were sent by him instead of those which ought to have been sent—this is dated 22nd Dec 1851 and is addressed to Mr Oudinet coachbuilder Verdun—I received that by post from Mr Oudinet—this is a letter written in accordance with the instructions which I gave the prisoner on the evening of 20th Dec —this other is the letter which he wrote to Mr Fellme which is in accordance with my instructions it is dated 22nd Dec instead of 20th—at the bottom of this letter the prisoner writes If you should have to name the date of this letter you would have to state the 20th because I ought to have written on Saturday but I forgot it oblige me in this in order that I may not get scolded —the prisoner said nothing to me before leaving about having written this order—when I paid him his wages on 17th Jan I asked him to give me a receipt as usual and he said I do not want any money to-night as my time is not up —I said Never mind give me your receipt and I will pay you —he then made out a receipt and I paid him—that was up to the 20th—after I gave it him I said Now you understand our agreement is at an end —he said Yes I know it —I said Therefore I have no further occasion for you —he made no further claim on me—this produced is his receipt Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q I observe that these letters which you have got from Paris and Verdun are signed by procuration A Yes it was not the prisoner s habit to sign my business letters by procuration I will swear that except on special occasions by special order that did not occur perhaps twice in three months—I am sure it was on 17th Jan that I discharged the prisoner—I believe I first heard of this order about 29th Feb —the prisoner was taken up on 9th March—I suppose that was about a week after an action had been brought against me by the prisoner because the letter from Verdun was on 25th it was more than a week it was a fortnight—the action was on one of these papers—the prisoner had been with me altogether about six years—during that time I had perfect confidence in him so far as I know—I know nothing against his character—I was not embarrassed in my circumstances in 1851—previous to signing these papers I was not embarrassed—I did not repeatedly borrow money in the course of that year—I have borrowed money perhaps twice altogether it may be 150l —not of the prisoner but of my father-in-law—I never owed any man anything that I did not pay I never borrowed a penny of the prisoner I swear that—my wife was before the Magistrate but was not examined—when I had signed the papers in blank the prisoner held up one of them and said This is a dangerous thing to do I might rob you by this a great deal —I treated it unfortunately with contempt and laughed—there was no notice required to be given to the prisoner our agreement ended on 20th Jan but still I did give him notice before witnesses—he came to my house several times after I had discharged him to know whether I could not give him any farther employment MR PARRY Q You have been asked about an action was the action brought on that alleged agreement producing a paper A Yes this is one of the sheets of paper that I wrote my name to—the body of it is not in the prisoner s writing—I never saw it before we obtained an order from the Court of Exchequer to examine it—there is an attesting witness to it G H Grellier of 4 Leicester-square —I never signed that paper in his presence—I do not know him and never saw him—this paper was not written by my authority or with my knowledge it purports to be an agreement for me to have the prisoner s services for two years at 90l a year—I was never in embarrassed circumstances in my life MARY SCHWEITZER I am the prosecutor s wife On Saturday afternoon 20th Dec I went to him at his office and heard him instruct the prisoner to write two letters one to his agent in Paris and one to Mr Oudinet—he signed two blank sheets of paper by my interference for that purpose and left them—the prisoner held one of them up to me smiled and said I might ruin you with this Mrs Schweitzer —I said Oh you would not do that I am sure GEORGE EMILE POIDEVIN through an interpreter I am clerk to Messrs Jullien bankers at Rouen On 14th Feb the prisoner came there and said Have you received a letter from Mr Schweitzer ordering the payment of a certain sum named some thousand and odd francs —Mr Jullien produced this letter and told him if he made out the receipt he would pay him the money named in the letter—the prisoner then wrote this receipt across the letter— translating it—Received from Mr G P W Jullien the sum of 1 062 francs 13 centimes 13th Feb 1852 —Breque —that money was paid to the prisoner—I received this letter myself on 12th Feb at Rouen it came by post—Mr Jullien offered to pay the prisoner in bank notes he objected and said he would rather have it in cash—he said there was not sufficient cash in the house but he might no doubt get it by applying to M Foubert—the prisoner said he was going from there to Lille and thence to Belgium travelling on the business of Mr Schweitzer WILLIAM FOSTER I am post-master in the New North-road Hoxton This letter was posted at my office on the evening of 10th or morning of 11th Feb it bears the General Post mark of the 11th Henry Arthur Matthews boarding-school keeper Louis Manjeau hotel keeper Haymarket Conrad Michel hotel keeper New-street Covent-garden and Thomas Vielle wine merchant 24

Charles Massey a tobacconist of 164 Oxford-street—he keeps a betting list—on Tuesday night 13th April about 10 o clock the prisoner came there—my husband and I were sitting in the parlour adjoining the shop having our supper—I went out to attend to the prisoner—he wished to back a horse named Nancy —I think for the Chester cup for 10s —I called my husband who came to the counter and went to the desk to write a ticket—the prisoner handed me a 5l note—I took it next door to ask for change which they had not got and while I was there my husband came in took the note from me and sent me home to mind the shop—I found the prisoner waiting there—he said if he had known the difficulty we had to get change he could have got it himself by getting a glass of ale which I advised him to do as Mr Massey appeared so long gone and he said something about being so delayed that he had better have brought his nightcap—my husband returned in about twenty minutes with an officer Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q You took the note into your hands first I believe A I did I did not know that we had not got change but I did not like to change it being so late—I went out with it in my hand momentarily—my husband saw it before I went out and handled it—we did not say anything to each other about it the prisoner could have heard us—I said I will go next door and get it changed and went out—I did not object to the look of the note I merely thought it was late and I did not know the party passing it—Mr Massey did not tell me not to change it—I was not gone a second before he came after me and sent me back—there were two or three other customers in the shop besides the prisoner but no one connected with the shop CHARLES MASSEY I keep a tobacconist s shop at 164 Oxford-street and have a betting list there On Tuesday 13th April whilst sitting with my wife in the parlour the prisoner came in—my wife went out to serve him and when I understood his business I went to him—he said he wanted to back Nancy for the Chester Cup to the amount of 10s —I went to my desk to make out a ticket—the prisoner laid a 5l -note on the counter my wife took it up and asked if she should go and get change—I looked at it and not liking the appearance of it I said Yes go and get it changed —she went and I followed her into the next door took the note from her and sent her back to the shop—I then took the note to a neighbour s and compared it with a genuine note—I was satisfied there was a difference and took it to the police station in Marylebone-lane to ask their opinion of it—I gave the note to Roberts the officer after putting my initials on it—this is it produced —I then returned to the shop with an officer—I said to the prisoner I have nearly got into a pretty mess I have been charged with trying to pass a bad note —he said Who has done so —I said Come along with me —he said Very well and he walked with me and the officer to the station the officer was in his uniform—I did not give him into custody—the inspector asked him his name and where he lived—he said his name was William Ward and he lived at 14 King-street Soho at Mrs Williams s that he occupied two rooms and that he was a journeyman painter and had been out of employ some months and had lived on his money—he was asked how he became possessed of the note and he would not tell them—he said he did not know he could not account for it it was his business—the policeman asked him if he had got any more of them—he said something to the effect that he had got more notes at home—I did not understand him to mean more bad notes but more money Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q How long were you gone for the change of this note A About twenty minutes—I did not try at all to get it changed I merely showed it at two places to ask the people s opinion upon it—I did not want change because I had plenty of change in my pocket—I did not express any suspicion of the note in the prisoner s presence—I did not converse with my wife about it—she gave it me in his presence—I told her to get it changed and said it would require my name and address on it—I did not express my opinion of it by my manner—I must have appeared to him as if I was anxious to get it changed—there were no other persons in the betting room and when I returned there was no one there but my wife and the prisoner CHARLES ROBERTS policeman D 107 On 13th April between 10 and 11 o clock at night Mr Massey came to the station with the note—I took it and put my initials upon it—this is it—I went across to a confectioner s and compared it with another note to see whether it was good or not and while I was gone Mr Massey went back to his shop and returned with the prisoner and an officer—I told the prisoner the note was a bad one and he must consider himself in my custody—I said Where did you get this from — Oh he said that is my business I have got plenty more of them — Oh indeed I said—the charge was then taken by the inspector—we asked his name and where he lived—he said William Ward 14 King-street Soho and he was a painter—I took a cab immediately and went to 14 King-street Soho—I found no Mrs Williams there or any person lodging there named Ward Cross-examined Q Was Mr Massey present at the time you took the prisoner A Yes TIMOTHY CONNELL I am a tailor and live at 14 King-street Soho I have lived there for the last fourteen years—I let a portion of the house—I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge—I never had a Mrs Williams lodging with me Cross-examined Q Are there any ladies lodging at your house A Not single ladies THOMAS RICHARDS policeman M 10 I have known the prisoner from eight to ten years—his name is William Hall—I do not think he has been doing anything particular for the last two years—before that I have seen him serving behind the bar of his father s public house—I saw him not long before this charge was made against him—I never knew him by the name of Ward or living at 14 King-street Soho Cross-examined Q Where did his father reside A In Old Gravel-lane—he kept the George for many years but has been away from it these two years SARAH RICHARDSON I am the wife of Henry Richardson of 39 Hall-street City-road I have a brother named Gascoigne a butcher at 108 Curtain-road Shoreditch On Saturday night 10th April the prisoner came to my brother s shop about 9 o clock—he asked for a leg of mutton—he was shown some—he said they were all too large for his family and he chose a leg of lamb instead—it came to 3s 11 1/2 d —he gave me a 5l note—he said the leg of lamb was to be sent to 27 Worship-street—I said The boy shall take it directly —when he gave me the note I told him I was afraid my brother could not give change—I gave my brother the note he gave the prisoner change and he left—the leg of lamb was given to the boy George Cunningham to take home—I should think the prisoner was in the shop ten minutes I cannot exactly say—on the Monday week following I went to the House of Detention and there saw and recognized the prisoner—he is the person that came for the leg of mutton COURT Q I suppose you are very busy on Saturday night A Yes it is always a very busy time in a butcher s shop—the shop was very full—I did not bestow more time on his leg of lamb than was necessary—I attended upon other customers Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q When you gave the note to your brother did you go on attending to other customers A Yes a policeman fetched me to go to the House of Detention—he told me that the prisoner was in custody for uttering a 5l note in Oxford-street—he did not say that the man was in custody who had passed the 5l note to me—he said there was a man in custody for passing a 5l note—the prisoner was not pointed out to me at the prison—I am quite sure of that—I saw him in a cell by himself—the policeman was not with me—the young man at the shop was with me—he is not here—he could not recognise the prisoner—I felt sure he was the man—I had some hesitation at first but I saw him again at Marlborough-street And was confident then—I had not the same confidence at first that I had when I saw him at Marlborough-street—I told the police that the young man could not recognize the prisoner and they did not bring him as a witness—he went there for the purpose of recognising him MR CLARKSON Q What was the opportunity and how was it exercised of your seeing the prisoner at the House of Detention A I was shown several prisoners I should say eight or nine or it might be more—one of the officers showed me round—he opened the different doors and told me to look in and asked if there was any one there I knew—I said yes there was one there who I suspected was the man but I could not swear to him positively then WILLIAM GASCOIGNE I am a butcher of 108 Curtain-road Shoreditch My sister was at my place on Saturday 10th April—in the course of the evening about 9 o clock I think a man came in for a leg of mutton—it was the prisoner—he at last selected a leg of lamb to be sent to 27 Worship-street—my sister who was taking the money handed me a 5l note for change and I gave the prisoner 4l 15s 11 1/2 d out of it—I put the note into my purse and placed it in the till—I had no other note in the house—the prisoner said The boy can go with me —I gave the boy the lamb and told him to take it to 27 Worship-street and he went after the prisoner—Worship-street is the next street—the prisoner went that way when he left the shop—I think he was in the shop altogether rather more than ten minutes—I noticed the note when I received it and held it up to the gas light and looked at it—I observed the name of Smith written at the back and also some figures—this is the note produced —the boy came back shortly afterwards with the leg of lamb and made a communication to me—I then took the note out of my purse looked at it and replaced it again—I kept it there till I went up stairs to bed that night and then placed it in a secret drawer in my bedroom—on the Monday I took it to Messrs Pocklington and Lacy in Smithfield and showed it to Mr Lacy—it did not go out of my sight—I then put it into my pocket and at 6 the same evening I took it to the police station in Featherstone-street and gave it to Evans the policeman—before doing so I put my name at the back—on the Thursday following I went to the House of Detention—I there saw twelve or fourteen prisoners and among them was the prisoner—he was the last one I saw—I did not want to see any more—I believed him to be the person Cross-examined Q Did you go with your sister A No she went a few days after me—Roberts the policeman came for me—he did not tell me they had got the man who had passed the note to me—he said they had got a man for passing a 5l note in Oxford-street and I was to come and see whether that was the same man—I went through the cells—they opened twelve or fourteen I should think COURT Q Did you before your sister went tell her that you had been there A Yes and that I had seen the man—I noticed that the man who passed the note had a very full eye a thin face and a peculiar action of the neck—he stood by my side—I am rather deaf and he kept putting his head forward—we had several customers that night MR PARRY Q Did not you speak of the party as a man resembling the prisoner A I did I said at the police court that the resemblance was most striking and I say so now—this is my deposition looking at it —Mr Bingham asked me Do you believe the prisoner to be the man and I said I do the resemblance is most striking —those were my words—I also said the resemblance was very great GEORGE CUNNINGHAM I occasionally assist Mr Gascoigne I remember a man coming there on the evening after Good Friday—he wanted change for a 5l note—he bought a leg of lamb—the prisoner is the person—he gave the note to Mr Gascoigne s sister—I heard the prisoner say the lamb was to be taken to 27 Worship-street—it was given to me and I followed the prisoner with it—I went towards Worship-street—he joined another man like himself and walked fast up the Curtain-road—I went oh to Worship-street—I found two No 27 s—I took the lamb to both of them they would not take it in at either—I brought it back and told my master—some time afterwards I think it was last week I came to Newgate and was shown about a dozen prisoners—I pointed out the prisoner among them Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q How was it you did not go before the Magistrate A I do not know I was told to go to Newgate—my master and mistress had not told me that they had seen the man that passed the 5l note they said nothing about it they asked me if I knew where Newgate was and I said no and they said Ask the policeman —I went by myself to Newgate—I had not heard them talk about having been to the House of Detention or about the man that passed the note—I knew that a man had passed a note because I saw him give it—I heard my master tell the man that it was a bad note—I did not hear him say that he had seen the man that passed it and that he was in Newgate—I knew what I was coming to Newgate for—I did not know the prisoner s name—I did not know that my master and mistress had been before the Magistrate—I was first spoken to about going to Newgate last week the day on which I went—my master told me to go and see if I could recognise the man that passed the bad 5l note—I went and saw about twelve men walking round the yard—Roberts was not with me nor any policeman only the turnkey—I pointed out the prisoner MR CLARKSON Q You were to have gone with Roberts but missed him is that so A Yes I went by myself—I told them what I came for—they showed me round and I pointed out the prisoner MR PARRY Q Before you pointed out this man did not you point out another A Yes they told me to be sure—I only pointed out two that one and the prisoner—I pointed to the other one because I did not particularly look at this one—I was looking at the twelve men to see which was most like—I saw one that was like and then I thought I saw another that was more like this one was more like than the other—after pointing out the prisoner I did not go on looking at any more—I was told that he was the man MR CLARKSON Q Was that after or before you had pointed him out A After when I saw this man I felt sure he was the man—I feel sure about it now COURT Q I suppose when you saw the first man you were sure too were you not A No I said I thought he was the man—they said Be sure and then I looked at some more and said That is the man —they did not tell me to be sure then they said he was the man JOSHUA FREEMAN I am one of the inspectors of bank-notes at the Bank of England I have looked at these two notes one No 94650 dated 2nd Sept 1850 and the other 23432 dated 4th July 1851 they are both forgeries in every respect paper plate and signature one is pretty well done—they are not from the same plate and I do not think the paper is the same Witnesses for the Defence CHARLELS WARD I am a printer On Saturday evening 10th April last I was at a public house called the Falcon I believe in Old Fish-street from about ten minutes or a quarter past 6 till five or ten minutes past 10 o clock—I was drinking some ale at the bar with a gentleman named Hughes and the prisoner—it was proposed that we should have a game at cribbage and we went into the parlour and played—I and a Mr Williams the prisoner and Mr Hughes played—I can swear that the prisoner never left the room from the time I went there till after 10 Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Who do you work for A Mr Dick opposite Mrs Coghlan s who keeps this public house—I think the sign is the Falcon—I have known the house for the last seven or eight years—I believe it has been kept by the same landlady—Mr Williams is not here to day—Mr Hughes is he kept a public house some time ago in Bermondsey-new-road—I do not know how far that is from Gravel-lane I do not know Gravel-lane—I had never seen the prisoner before the night I speak of the 10th—I think it was the 10th it was the Saturday before Easter Sunday—I was not before the Magistrate—I nodded to the prisoner when I came into the witness box because I saw he was the gentleman who was in my company on 10th April—I had not seen him since until to day—swear that MR GIFFARD Q You were subpoenaed here this morning I believe A I was nothing was said to me by the prisoner s solicitor before I came in about recognizing him—I looked at him because if I could not have sworn to him I should not have taken my oath COURT Q You say you were playing cribbage together that night A Yes we commenced about half past 7 o clock or near upon 8 and the prisoner never left my company till past 10—that was the first time I had ever seen him in my life and the last time until to-day—I did not give him my address—Mr Hughes called on me about this I have known him some years—I do not know whether he knew the prisoner—it is often the case that you go into a public house and play with persons you never saw before—Mr Hughes was my partner and the prisoner and Williams—Mr Hughes and I won the whole of the games I believe it was four games we played for a pint of ale each we won four pints and the prisoner and Mr Williams played off—I sat looking over the prisoner and telling him what cards to throw out—the landlady charged sixpence too little in the reckoning—the prisoner told the landlady of it and paid it—I parted with the prisoner about ten minutes past 10 by Mr Calvert s printing office going towards Black-friars-bridge MR GIFFORD Q Was there not a person of the name of Rowker that although he did not play A Yes but he was only there till something like half past 8 or a quarter to 9 o clock—we were together—I left work about 6—we make a practice of going over to this public house on a Saturday night to have a glass of ale WILLIAM HUGHES I have been a publican I was at the Falcon on 10th April last I think I went there five or ten minutes before 6 o clock and I left about five or ten minutes after 10—Mr Ward was there—a person named Rowker and a person named Williams and the prisoner—I am sure the prisoner was not out of my company from ten minutes before 6 till I went away Cross-examined You say you have been a publican A Yes I cannot say that the dogs used to fight in my place—I did not have dogs fight there twice a week never in my life—the sign of the house was the Moulders Arms in Red-cross-street Borough—queerish company came there now and then—I cannot say whether thieves sometimes came I never asked them—I know nothing about forged notes—I never saw one that I am aware of—I do not know the market price of them—since I gave up the Moulders Arms I have been looking after another public house—I have not left the Moulders Arms above four or five months—I am now living at 3 Bermondsey-street in the front parlour—I have two rooms—I am married but have no family—I have lived there ever since I left the Moulders Arms—the landlord s name is Clark—I pay perhaps 4s a week—I left the Moulders Arms because it did not suit me—I did not fail the house failed—a person named Rawdon succeeded me—it is not a small house—I left the furniture there the incoming tenant took it at a valuation—I have been living on part of the money—I sold it for 250l —I cannot say what I owed—I paid what I owed as near as I could—I have known the prisoner these eight or ten years his father kept a public house in Gravel-lane that was where I first knew him—I cannot say what he has been doing since—I was not particularly intimate with him—I went with him to this public house this night from my house—he came there as we were having tea—I used not to see him very often—perhaps a fortnight previous to that I might see him—I saw him sometimes once a week or once a fortnight—I cannot tell where he lived—it was somewhere by the Elephant and Castle but I cannot tell where—I believe his father now keeps a house at Rotherhithe—I think he is here to-day—I think I have seen the prisoner since 10th April—I am not certain—I have not been to see him in Newgate—I do not know how he got his living—I do not know where he was on 13th April—I was not before the Magistrate I was subpoenaed here I think yesterday by Mr How the solicitor—I cannot tell when I first heard of his being in trouble or who I heard it from COURT Q On what day had you last seen him before 10th April A I cannot exactly say—it might have been one day in that week very likely—I cannot exactly say whether I have seen him since 10th April or not—I have not seen him since he has been in trouble—I remember this occurred on Saturday 10th April because I expected to get some money from one of the workmen that evening which I had lent him and he paid me 10s and the prisoner happened to be with me which made me notice it and it was the Saturday before Easter Sunday—I went into the Falcon with the prisoner—I saw Ward there—he came in perhaps a quarter of an hour after we had been there—I think Williams and Rowker came in with him—we were talking and conversing in front of the bar from six o clock till 8 and then it was proposed that we should go into the parlour and have a hand of cards which we did—we played four games of cribbage I and Ward were partners and the prisoner and Williams—we won three games and the others one—we played for 3d a corner a pint of ale each CHARLES ROWKOR I am a printer I went to the Falcon on 10th April about five minutes past 6 o clock—I staid there till five or tea minutes past 9—I and two or three of my shopmates were standing at the bar for some time and then we went into the parlour—the prisoner was there and I sat in the parlour with him till nine or ten minutes past 9 and he never left my company—I then went away COURT Q Did you leave him behind A Yes they played cribbage—I was not playing with them and I cannot tell who were partners—I was playing at all fives with a shopmate—the others played I think for some ale and I think they had some gin and water—I did not notice who paid for it—I had some—I was in the parlour all the time I was there GUILTY Aged 23 — Transported for

Cross 33 Barbican I have a brother a carpenter who lives at 21 Gerard-street Soho—the prisoner Grover had been in my brother s service—I had known him about two years—on Saturday 17th April about 4 o clock he came to my house before the bar and called for a pint of porter—he said How do you do Mr Salway —I said I am very well thank you what are you doing now —he said Nothing —he stood there for some few minutes and then put his elbow on the counter and whispered to me Have you ever taken any bad money since you have been here —I then said Well what has been brought I have been very fortunate I have detected it —he then put his hand into his trowsers pocket pulled out a shilling and said he served butchers and bakers and publicans with this sort of coin at 1s 6d per dozen—I then asked him how long he had followed that profession—he replied About a month after I left your brother as I had neither money nor clothes —he then took the shilling up off the counter and went away as he saw me going towards the private box I suppose he thought I was coming out to him—after he had gone I told the sergeant of police—I saw no more of Grover until the Saturday following when he came about 10 in the morning—he asked me if I could change him a 5l or a 10l note—I asked him was it genuine or how he came in possession of it knowing the capacity he was in before—he said It is we fell across it or tumbled over it in Drury-lane —I then said Well bring it and let me look at it —he then said What time shall I come —I said At 5 o clock —he said he would come at 7—I said I shall be busy at that time come at 5 —he agreed to do so and went away—I went to the police station and told them what had occurred and about 4 in the afternoon Bull and Packman came and waited there up till 11 at night—Grover did not come and they then went away—on the Saturday following 1st May about 7 in the evening Grover came in company with Donoghue—they came together—I was at the bar—Grover said I have brought these notes can you change them for me —I then did as the police constable had told me invited them into the parlour and went into the parlour to them—I first sent my barman over for the police—Donoghue pulled the notes out of his pocket—they were two 5l and one 1l note—I did not look at them at that time but I did when I took them into the kitchen—I said What do you want for them —he said 17l —Grover was in the room and within hearing—I said I suppose you would take 16l would you not —he said No not less than 17l look at them —I did not look at them—I put them into my pocket and went out—I told them to wait a bit and I would bring them the change—I went out of the parlour to the back door expecting to find the police—Costigan an officer was there—my barman had fetched him—I took him to the parlour and said Stop these men don t allow them to move out of the parlour —before that as I was coming out of the parlour I heard Grover say to Donoghue It is all over with us —I think he saw Costigan—he was in his uniform—I then went into the kitchen with the officer Banks who had come in afterwards—I showed the notes to him and told him what had transpired—I then returned to the parlour with Banks and said to the prisoners These gentlemen will give you the change —the policemen took them into custody—I handed the notes to Banks Cross-examined by MR DEARSLEY Q When Donoghue showed you the notes first he took them out of his pocket A He did they were not wrapped up in anything—they were folded up when he gave them to me—there was no one in the parlour but ourselves—I had never seen Donoghue before—I was well acquainted with Grover—I have seen him on many occasions in the workshop—I did not know his name—I never saw him in company with Donoghue—Donoghue did not say that Grover had asked him to ask 17l for them I am quite sure of that—I asked what he wanted for them and he said 17l —that was all he said—I did not give Grover in charge to the police on the 24th April when he offered me the bad money at 18d a dozen—I told the police-sergeant what had occurred—I remember my house being burnt down—it was insured in the Sun Fire-office—I got the insurance for it I swear that they did not for a considerable time refuse to pay it—I have been about twelve months at my present house—before that I was at the Crown and Cushion—I have never been in any other business—I am a seafaring man by profession—I left the sea about three years back—I have been in the public line ever since Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q Who was in the room besides you and the prisoners A No one there were no persons outside the parlour door—there is a glass window to the parlour—there were no persons outside that window—it opens into a passage which leads into the kitchen or into the bar or the street—I was examined before the Magistrate—the Magistrate misunderstood me—there were people outside the street door who came with the prisoners who were in the same party with them and there were people at the bar but not in the passage—I believe this is not the first time that I have stated that Grover said It is all over with us —I believe I stated it at Guildhall ROBERT PACKMAN City policeman 133 On Saturday 24th April about 4 o clock in the afternoon I went to Mr Salway s from information he sent and remained there till about a quarter past 10 with Bull—nothing occurred that night GEORGE BANKS City policeman 153 On Saturday 1st May I was on duty at Barbican near the Redcross public-house—Mr Salway called me over and gave me some information on the subject of notes—when I got there I found Costigan there—I went with Mr Salway into the kitchen and he produced these three notes to me looking at them —I then went with him to the parlour—I found Costigan at the door and the prisoners in the parlour—I told them they must consider themselves in custody—Donoghue asked what for—I told them to accompany me to the station and I would explain it to them—I took Grover and Costigan took Donoghue to the station in Moor-lane where I handed the notes to sergeant Watson—he asked the prisoners their names and addresses—Donoghue gave his name as Garrett Donoghue of 72 Carlisle-street Westminster and Grover gave William Grover 15 Denzel-street Drury-lane —inspector Joy came in shortly afterwards and the notes were handed to him—he asked the prisoners if they could account for the notes or throw any light upon them and said I can tell you they are all forged notes —Donoghue replied When the man comes down to charge us we will tell you —Mr Salway was sent for—he came and the charge was taken—the prisoners did not then give any account—they were searched—on Grover was found a book and two duplicates and 2d in copper and on Donoghue a knife a key and an old half-guinea—I went to 15 Denzel-street but found no such person as Grover known or living there—I also went to 72 Carlisle-street—I found no such name as Donoghue there—I received the notes back from Mr Joy the same evening—these are them—I put my initials to them—they were never out of my sight from the time I received them from Mr Salway Cross-examined by MR DEARSLEY Q What charge did Mr Salway make against them A For offering two 5l and one 10l Bank of England forged notes it was not for having stolen notes I swear that MR DEARSLEY to MR SALWAY Q When you gave the prisoners into custody to Banks what was the charge you made A Having the notes I did not know whether they were stolen or forged or what they were—I do not think I said it was for having stolen notes in their possession—I did not know whether they were stolen or forged—I did not use the words stolen to my knowledge—I cannot swear one way or the other—I had not examined the notes DANIEL COSTIGAN City policeman 140 examined by MR DEARSLEY I am not aware what charge Mr Salway made against the prisoners—when I entered the house he said Don t let them go —at that time they were in the parlour—I stopped there till Banks came

warrant and other COUNTS charging them with forging the acceptance to the said bill MESSRS CLARKSON and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution MR CLARKSON previous to opening the case stated his impression that the evidence was so slight with respect to the prisoner Birch that he should not press the case against him At the close of his address he proposed to take an acquittal at once as to Birch and call Him as a witness MR PARRY objected to this course of proceeding he having requested all the witnesses to be out of Court and Birch having been present during the opening He was not aware of any rule that would prevent his being examined but under these circumstances he hoped the Court would give a direction to that effect MR JUSTICE CRESSWELL could not take upon himself to do that nor in his opinion was there much ground for the objection as MR CLARKSON had in fact opened an acquittal of Birch BIRCH— NOT GUILTY HENRY BIRCH I have surrendered here to day—I live in Belgium—when in London I live in Ranelagh-street Pimlico—I know both the prisoners—I have known Gurney about six years probably—I have not always known him by that name—I have known him by the name of Norton—I have known Coleman since the latter end of May last—on 24th July last Gurney had a counting house at St Mary-at-hill—I was at his counting house that morning—I repeatedly called in for he had written to me on a certain matter of business—while I was in conversation with him Coleman came in—Coleman asked me whether I could get a bill discounted—he said it was a bill from Nicaragua—he told me that Mr Bottin had gone out to Nicaragua and had left his signature on blank to be filled up—I told him that I had met a Mr Tucker the day before who had asked me whether I had any bills to discount coming through my hands and I told Coleman I would name the bill to Mr Tucker which I did the same day—I afterwards called on Coleman on 26th July at his own office—that was in Mark-lane—I am not able to say the number—I found him at home—he asked me whether I was going into Eastcheap—I said I was—he said Here is the bill if you call in passing Gurney s he will endorse the bill —he produced this bill to me looking at the bill which was marked A —it was in the same state it is now when he showed it to me then except having the signature of Gurney and Co —he had shown it to me before on the 24th—it was then in blank—I cannot say it was this identical bill—it was similar to this but without any writing whatever upon it—I had been a round on the morning of the 26th and it was in my way to call on Mr Coleman—I then called on Gurney—I saw him and he endorsed the bill in his office in my presence-after he had endorsed it I took it to Mr Tucker s—Coleman had not told me previously to that how much money I was to raise on the bill—Mr Tucker s ffices were closed when I went there—I did not see him afterwards respecting the bill—I never showed him this bill at all—I afterwards went to a Mr Sturm s offices on that same day the 26th—that is No 6 Bennett s-place—I showed him the bill—he did not discount it—I then took it to Mr Isaacs in Jeffrey-square St Mary-Axe—Mr Isaacs name had never been mentioned to Coleman by me at all before that—J knew of a connection subsisting between Mr Isaacs and Coleman—I left the bill with Mr Isaacs that same day the 26th—on the following day I called on Gurney and told him where I had left the bill—I requested him to give me a letter to state that a certain amount would be taken for the bill—he gave me this letter marked B

Nicaragua upon and accepted by Coleman and Bottin Mark-lane London Gurney and Co —I believe Mr Coleman got to know where I had left the bill on 26th July—he asked me Have you given the bill to Mr Isaacs —I did not answer him directly but I said When you pass a bill from your hands you do not know whose hands it gets into —he said he knew it was in Mr Isaacs hands—I said that Mr Isaacs had promised to give money for the bill—he said I want the bill I will not take money from Mr Isaacs he is my greatest enemy —I said Mr Isaacs had promised to give money for the bill and it was in his hands and I believed that he would do so—that was all that passed—I saw Mr Isaacs again the following day—I never got the bill back from him Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Who introduced you to Coleman or Coleman to you A Mr Sturm—I believe he is a friend of Mr Isaacs—he goes there whether he is a friend or not—I know him very well—I have known Mr Isaacs about seven years—I do not recollect whether I ever took a bill to him before I know that bills have been—I never before had a forged bill in my possession that I took to Mr Isaacs—I never that I know of had in my possession a forged bill upon Messrs Armitage of Huddersfield nor had Mr Isaacs to my knowledge—I have had bills passing in my business from parties in Huddersfield—I never had a forged bill in my possession upon Messrs Armitage of Huddersfield—that I swear—nor had Mr Isaacs to my knowledge—no such bill was ever in my possession or attempted to be negotiated by me or Mr Isaacs to ray knowledge—I may have taken a bill to Mr Isaacs at one time but I cannot call it to my memory upon Mr Spalding here—I think he had a bill once—I have got bills discounted—I know a man of the name of Clarkson—I was never in partnership with him—I am not aware that he is a bill discounter—I have had some connection with him unfortunately for me—I have heard that he is a notorious bill stealer—I did not go and apply to Coleman for a bill he applied to roe—I was not instigated by Mr Sturm or Mr Isaacs to endeavour to get a bill from Coleman—the names of Coleman and Bottin were over the door in Mark-lane—it is about six years since I resided in England COURT Q Do you mean you have been in England six years A To and fro I have business that calls me here—I have not resided here for six years I have resided abroad MR PARRY Q You come backwards and forwards A Yes I have never had any trading transactions with Mr Isaacs never—I once carried on business in London under the name of Birch Son and Co —I think that is about six years ago—that business was a failure—I left England not in consequence of my heavy debts—I was in England after that—I was out of England about six weeks then—I was never in partnership with a man named Rondall—I went on the Continent with him—that was not at the time that he ran away from his bankruptcy that was only within this twelve months and this occurred in 1845—I was never a bankrupt—I went abroad with him at the latter end of 1845 or the commencement of 1846—I am not ware that he had been a bankrupt at that time—his bankruptcy was within this six months—I do not know a person of the name of Williams—I was never entrusted by a Mr Williams to sell large quantity of flannel for him—I bought some flannel for Mr Williams Q I thought you told me just now that you did not know a Mr Williams A I understood you to mean a party in London he is a Welshman—I beg your pardon I forgot the transaction—I was not entrusted hy him to sell it I bought it for him—it amounted to about 500l —he received two-thirds of the money I swear that he received it from me—he never charged me with absconding with the flannel that he had entrusted to me to sell to the amount of 300l or 500l or with the proceeds—no such charge was ever made against me nothing of the kind—I was once given in charge for another offence besides this and Mr Clarkson I believe had the management of it—that is about six years ago—I was not then indicted with Mr Sturm Mr Isaacs friend for conspiring to defraud persons of goods to the amount of 500l —that was not the charge—must I answer what the charge was —it was made by a Mr Degatur for placing goods out of his possession not for taking goods out of his possession—for placing goods that never came into his hands for money that I wanted from him—he made a charge against me—he stated that he was my employer and that I had defrauded him to the amount of 400l or 500l —it was not me and Mr Sturm together no charge was made against Mr Sturm that I am aware of in reference to that transaction in fact there was not—I had not clothes or goods of Mr Degatur to the amount of 500l —Mr Degatur ordered goods from the country through me—those goods came into my possession—they were to the amount of about 400l —Mr Degatur never paid for them—I did not pay for them—I was not committed for trial upon that case Mr Degatur never came forward Cross-examined by MR DEARSLEY Q How many years do you say you have known Gurney A I think four or five years or it may be more than that—I knew him by the name of Norton—I have known him by the name of Gurney probably six months—I do not know that he was formerly a cheesemonger—I have heard him say so—I do not know that he failed—I was told by Mr Isaacs to get this letter he did not dictate the letter to me before I went to Gurney—he stated that I must get a letter to state that such an amount would be taken—I stated that to Gurney and then Gurney gave me the letter MR BALLANTINE Q You have said that you saw over the office door the names of Coleman and Bottin did you ever see any person of the name of Bottin in your life A Never I am an export merchant at Antwerp in the provision line—I export eggs and butter to this country—I have been doing so for the last six years—this letter marked C on the fly-sheet in written by me and that on the other part by Gurney—I gave that for Gurney to take to Mr Isaacs but from a word that transpired from Gurney I went along with him for I was very much engaged that day and he wrote this in Mr Isaacs office ELIAS ISAACS I have offices in Jeffrey-square St Mary Axe I am a solicitor and have been so for upwards of half a century On 26th July last Birch came to my office with this bill of exchange it was then in the state it is now with the exception of an initial of the Lord Mayor s clerk who marked it at the Mansion-house—it was presented to me by Birch for discount—I gave him some directions as to writing in consequence of which this letter D was written—I received the bill from Birch in consequence of my statement to him enclosed in this letter—I observe on the bill the endorsement of Gurney and Co —from what passed between me and Birch on the subject of the discount of the bill I entertained suspicions about it—in consequence of that I gave Birch some directions with reference to Gurney and Co the endorsers of the bill—after giving him those directions I received from him the letter signed Gurney and Co that has been put in—he brought me that letter on the same day that he called with the bill—he also brought me this letter marked E —in consequence of those letters I received signed Gurney and Co I detained the bill for a while and made excuses from time to time for not discounting it—I afterwards received from Birch this letter dated the 28th marked F and also this of the 29th G this was left at my office in my absence but I received it MR CLARKSON to HENRY BIRCH Look at those three letter E F And G did you receive those three letters from Gurney A I did not receive that letter G it is Gurney s handwriting MR CLARKSON to MR ISSACS Q You say you received a second letter from Birch purporting to come from Gurney on that same day the 26th A Yes Q Had you expressed dissatisfaction as to the first letter A I did say to him that I ought to receive some instructions Letter marked E read — To Mr H Birch of Antwerp July 26 1852 Dear Sir —The enclosed bill of 187l 18s 9d is upon Messrs Coleman and Bottin drawn by Francis Bottin and Co at ninety days sight which we authorize you to negotiate and hand over the proceeds to as according to the arrangement between us —Gurney and Co —this is the same bill that was enclosed in that letter Letter marked F read — 28th July 1852 Dear Sir —If any use is made of the bill I think an undertaking should be given to bear me harmless when it becomes due and as Coleman and Bottin hold a bill drawn by me and accepted by themselves for 169l I ought to endeavour to get that out of their hands before they know anything respecting the bill with Mr Isaacs I shall be at the Blue Anchor 164 Fenchurch-street this afternoon to meet you as proposed at half past 3 —J Gurney —I never saw anything of the bill for 169l — Letter marked G read — To E Isaacs Esq 29th July 1852 Sir —We hereby give you notice that a bill dated Nicaragua for 187l drawn by Francis Bottin and Co in our favour and accepted by Messrs Coleman and Bottin of 59 Mark-lane has been fraudulently obtained from us without any consideration and you are hereby cautioned from making use of such bill in any shape whatever —Joseph Gurney and Co —the day after the receipt of that letter Birch called upon me MR CLARKSON proposed to give in evidence what passed between the witness and Birch Birch having been shown to be the agent of Coleman MR JUSTICE CRESWELL was of opinion that Birch must first be shown to be the agent in this particular transaction MR CLARKSON to HENRY BIRCH Q Did you go to Mr Isaacs on 80th July or some day near then to request back that bill A Yea I was requested to go—Mr Sturm had left a message at Eastcheap—I had not seen Coleman on the subject or Gurney—I did not produce to Mr Isaacs the letter signed Gurney —Gurney was with me the second time I went for the bill that was on 30th July—we saw Mr Isaacs then MR CLARKSON to MR ISAACS Q Had you more than one interview with Birch on 30th July A Yes the first interview was with Birch alone—I had a second interview on that same day with Birch and Gurney together Q Was it on that occasion that that letter signed on one side by Gurney and on the other by Birch was presented to you A It was signed by Gurney in my presence this is the letter marked C —they requested me to hand over the bill and I said that Mr Gurney should write a receipt for the same—he did so in my presence letter C read — To E Isaacs Esq 30th July 1852 Sir —You will please hand over to Mr Joseph Gurney of Joseph Gurney and Co their bill of 187l 18s 9d purporting to be drawn by Francis Bottin and Co of Nicaragua on and accepted by Coleman and Bottin Mark-lane London which I handed over to you for the purpose of discount and this is my authority for your so doing Henry Birch On the other side of this letter was written as follows — 30th July 1852 Received of Mr Isaacs the bill in question for 187l 18s 9d left by Mr Henry Birch for the purpose of discount Joseph Gurney Q At the time you took that memorandum of Birch and the receipt of Gurney did you at all intend to deliver up the bill A Certainly not they requested me to do so and I said I shall not give up the bill and I shall give both of you into custody —an officer was in my office and I gave them both into custody—I afterwards learnt where Coleman was and sent an officer after him—I had previously sent for Coleman to come to my office to receive his bill but from the place where Birch stated he was waiting he was gone—I intended to give him in charge—I then sent the officer after him and he took him—I know Coleman s handwriting—he is a connection of mine by marriage—his brother married my daughter unfortunately—I believe this acceptance to the bill of Coleman and Bottin Mark-lane to be Coleman s hand writing—the body of the bill I also believe to be in his writing—I cannot speak as to my belief of the signature of the supposed drawers Francis Bottin and Co that is a disguised hand—I cannot form any opinion or belief upon that—I cannot say whether the endorsement is Coleman s writing Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q You have seen Coleman write I suppose A I have I think I first saw Birch about twelve years ago—he has never brought bills to me before nor anything of the kind—I have had business transactions with him professionally—I never had any trading transactions with him—I am not in trade—he has never brought any bills to me before—he never sold me any bills nothing of the kind—I simply knew him professionally about twelve years ago—for the last five or six years I had not seen him or heard of him until the day he brought this bill—I never intended to discount this bill upon his asking 100l for it I felt satisfied there was something wrong and I took these steps for the purpose of detecting the wrongdoer—Coleman and I have not had any quarrel whatever Q Did you say to Birch at the time you gave him into custody or about that time that you did not care about him and Gurney all you wanted was to transport Coleman A I have no recollection of ever saying anything of the kind to the best of my memory I never said so—I cannot say whether I could have said such a thing and forgotten it—I never remember any such conversation—my belief is I did not say so—I am upon my oath—my impression strongly is that I never made use of language to that effect Q Have you not said repeatedly since the charge was made that Coleman would be transported and that at last you should convict him A I have no feeling about it except to do my duty—I never said that I would manage to convict him—I have no feeling whatever on the subject beyond doing my fair duty and giving my evidence as the facts occurred—I could not have said that Coleman would be transported and I should be glad of it—I never have said so Q Has it ever happened to you to have any other forged bills in your possession or bills alleged to be forged A Never to my recollection I swear I never had a forged bill in my possession before—when I say that I mean of course as far as my knowledge went—if a bill was passed and paid I knew nothing of it—I do not know the names of Messrs Armitage of Huddersfield—I never heard of their names before in any way—I have no ill feeling whatever towards Coleman Q Have you not complained that he gave information about your possession of some brandy warrants A I certainly complained of the villanous misrepresentations I have had some brandy warrants in my possession to the value as far as my memory carries me of about 150l not 800l —I sold some brandy warrants to Messrs Hart and Co —that must have been eight or nine months ago—I never heard that Mr Sturm and myself were to be indicted for conspiracy for obtaining those brandy warrants—I heard the impudent insinuation indirectly—I did not offer to give a bill for 100l to settle the matter MR PARRY proposed to put the witness s deposition into his hand and then to ask him whether he would venture to swear that he had never made the offer referred to MR JUSTICE CRESSWELL had known that course sometimes permitted but he believed Lord Campbell had recently refused to allow it MR O BREIN as amicus curiae stated that the question had been reserved by Lord Campbell and it was finally decided that it could not be done without giving the right of reply I say that I never did offer to give a bill for 100l to settle it nor any sum of money—I know Mr Brough Q Is he attorney for Messrs Hooper the wine merchants A He said he was not the attorney but the personal friend—I was invited there by Mr Hunter about the brandy warrants and I went there in consequence of the invite—I went there twice—I swear most positively that during those interviews with Mr Brough I never offered money or bills to settle the matter Q At the time you went to Mr Brough s office had you heard the impudent insinuation that Messrs Hooper and Son were going to indict you and Mr Sturm for conspiring to get these brandy warrants A Certainly not I swear that—the prisoner Coleman did not state in Mr Brough s office that I and Sturm had conspired by fraud to get those warrants I will swear that—Coleman made no charge at all against me certainly not of fraud Q In your interview with Mr Brough will you swear that you never heard at all of any indictment or proceedings against you for fraud of some kind or other about these brandy warrants A Mr Brough told me they insinuated it and he repudiated it most strongly knowing I could not be guilty of such a thing—that was his statement to me after they were gone—Mr Brough has known me for forty years and he made that declaration to me—I have been to Mr Brough s twenty times—I will explain how I came to go there about these brandy warrants Mr Brough requested me to endeavour to get Sturm to remove an attachment that he had lodged against the goods of Hooper and Co —it had nothing to do with the brandy warrants—I certainly never had any conversation with Mr Brough about the warrants or about settling it or anything of the kind—he applied to me to speak to Sturm to remove the attachment that was lodged against Hooper and Co s goods and stating to me how much he had lost by Coleman or something to that effect and I did in consequence of Mr Brough s solicitations do all I could to render service to his friends—I had never sold brandy warrants before and I should not have had anything to do with those it was my son-in-law that induced me unfortunately—no bills alleged to have been stolen have ever been traced into my possession it is all invention Q Then there is no truth whatever I suppose in the suggestion that Louis Napoleon s bills were found in your possession A How do you mean found in my possession my own property that I gave the money for and he paid it when due it is not a fact that two bills alleged to have been stolen from Louis Napoleon were traced to my possession I swear that most positively it is all invention—some parties were tried here in reference to those two bills—I was here and instructed by Louis Napoleon to assist his prosecution—I swear that I was instructed by Louis Napoleon—I was not acting as his attorney Messrs Lawford were his attorneys and Messrs Bush and Mullens prosecuted for him but I aided Louis Napoleon at his request and was paid for it by his attorney—those two bills had not been negotiated by me—the bill I had of Louis Napoleon s was paid when due—I was a holder of one bill of his for 500l which was regularly paid when due Q You unfortunately had a charge made against you some years ago I believe but the parties never appeared against you A That is not true I am not bound to answer whether I was ever charged with any offence but I will do so between forty and fifty years ago I was indicted for perjury the attempt was to extort money from me I was tried for it and of course acquitted and I prosecuted the parties and punished them—no other charge has ever been made against me without it was behind my back I do not know what you are talking about Q Has any other charge been made against you you seem to answer No rather faintly has any other charge been actually made against you of fraud or anything of the kind A No I have no doubt about it I mean distinctly to tell you that by No I mean no—my Lord am I to be thus treated it is really very painful— MR JUSTICE CAREWELL thought it would be introducing an inconvenient extension of cross-examination if a general question of this sort were put without pointing it to something Q Besides being an attorney I believe you are a bill-discounter as well we understand that A No indeed you understand very wrong if you have been told that—I have done such a thing occasionally Cross-examined by MR DEARSLEY Q Did you ever see Gurney more than once A Never except before the Magistrate ALFRED JAMES SHOTTER I am in the employ of Messrs Niessen and Parker engravers at 43 Mark-lane I know the plate from which this bill of exchange was taken—I received orders for engraving that plate—to the best of my belief the prisoner Gurney was one of the two who ordered the plate—it was on Thursday 24th June I think—they gave the firm of Coleman and Bottin as the parties from whom the order came—I had not to be printed from the plate—I cannot say whether they were delivered at the counter or at the offices in Mark-lane but they were delivered—I know the paper upon which this bill is printed—it has been in our possession—I selected the paper upon which the bills were to be printed and this is a portion of it—the name of our firm is not on the bill—we generally put our name unless ordered to the contrary—the gentlemen who gave this order directed that the name of the engraver in the imprint should be left out—our name was engraved upon the plate and I ordered it to be erased in consequence of the orders I received from the parties—I know Coleman by his being introduced to our shop a day or two afterwards as Mr Coleman of the firm of Coleman and Bottin—he was introduced by another man who I have not seen in custody—he called on the 28th to see a proof of the plate—I cannot say for certain whether I showed him one—here-quested six copies to be sent on immediately and the rest were forwarded on the Monday evening—I cannot say whether the six first were sent or delivered over the counter—I have seen Coleman in Mark-lane once or twice since 28th June—I went to the address given me to get paid the balance for the plate—I saw a clerk in the office—I do not recollect seeing either of the prisoners there—I was not paid anything on that occasion—we were paid 2l on account a day or two afterwards by a man who is not in custody—when the order was first given I showed them different samples of paper and the one they chose had the maker s name Turner in the water mark and that they requested to be left out of the bill—when the paper was cut up into the shape of bills that mark would appear in about one in ten Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Do you generally execute these bills without a water mark if you can A It does not matter to us at all—we do unless ordered to the contrary—I believe we have been ordered to execute them without a mark—I have never taken an order of that kind before myself —we are respectable engravers and did as we were requested to do without any doubt or hesitation—Mr Niessen is here—I had only been there four months at that time—a person came in reference to these bills who was not brought up at the Mansion House COURT Q And that same person paid you the 2l A Yes HILARY NICOLAS NIESSEN examined by MR PARRY It is not at all unusual to have the engraver s name taken out from a bill—we are constantly in the habit of engraving bills of this description without our names—there is nothing at all unusual in taking out the water mark in engraving what appears to be foreign bills—we are in the habit of engraving bills in London which bear on them the names of places very remote in all parts of the world—all the respectable engravers in London are in the habit of doing the same GEORGE JERWOOD I am in the employment of Mr Abraham Tozer of 59 Mark-lane—I know the prisoner Coleman—on 16th or 17th June he took a counting house on our second floor—he continued to occupy it about seven weeks—I am the housekeeper there—the names of Coleman and Bottin were put but Mr Bottin I never saw Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q You were not actually present at the taking of these rooms and do not know who actually took them of your own knowledge do you A Excuse me but you have got Mr Tozer s agreement and that will tell you that Mr Coleman is the gentleman that took them—I was not present at the taking of the rooms—Coleman has been out on bail—he has not been to the counting house above once during that time—he occupied it up to the time of his being arrested JAMES ALLAN I am clerk and cashier of the Strand branch of the Royal British Bank I know Coleman—he had an account with our bank—it was not closed in 1851—there was a balance of 6s 8d debtor on the account—on 30th June 1852 he opened a new account in the name of Coleman and Bottin—on opening that account I asked him for his signature—I took it in the signature book—he signed the name of the firm Coleman and Bottin I told him it was customary to get the signature of both partners—he said he was the only one that signed checks and it was unnecessary to give the name of the other partner—the signature of Coleman and Bottin to this bill is Coleman s writing—I cannot say in whose writing the body of the bill is—I have no opinion or belief about it—Coleman opened the new account with 7l Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q How long had he had an account with you when the balance of 6s 8d was left was it twelve months or so A Only one month—I do not recollect how much was paid in I have the ledger here and can refer to it—I think it was about 105l —that was not the whole amount paid in there were several hundred pounds I think 500l or 600l paid in in the ordinary way and then taken out MR CLARKSON Q What was the balance When the second account was closed A 2s 4d there is that balance at present standing in our books to their credit HENRY FOSTER I know the prisoner Gurney by the name of Norton he lived in Victoria-street Pentonville—I lived in the same house—he lived there in the name of Norton up to about eight weeks ago which was about the time of his apprehension—Mrs Snoxall was the landlady COURT Q How long had he been there A About four years I believe—I knew him there two years Cross-examined by MR DEARSLEY Q Do you know that he failed about two years ago and afterwards changed his name from Norton to Gurney A No I do not MARY SNOXALL I am landlady of the house in Victoria-street Pentonville where Gurney lodged four years with me and went by the name of Norton all the time—he left me six or seven weeks ago EDWARD TUCKER I am bill broker of 4 Birchin-lane On 24th July I saw a person of the name of Birch at our office he produced a paper to me—I cannot swear positively whether he produced this identical bill or a copy I rather think it was a copy—it was of the same amount as this one produced and precisely in the same terms—I did not entertain it in consequence of the names not standing in the Directory STEPHEN ISAACSON TUCKER I am the son of Mr Edward Tucker I was in his counting house on 28th July when Coleman came there and asked me whether I had a bill drawn by Francis Bottin and Co on Coleman and Bottin—I told him I did not recollect having seen such a bill—I did not recollect it at the moment—he said Birch had told him we had had it upwards of a week—I believe he said it was for 180l odd JOSEPH NETHERCLIFT I am a lithographic artist and printer I have been much accustomed to the examination of handwriting—I have seen the bill produced—I am able to form a judgment when a document is before me whether it is in the same or in different handwriting—I know nothing at all about the handwriting of the party by whom this bill was prepared MR CLARKSON proposed to ask the witness the following question Look at that bill and tell me to the best of your judgment is the body of it the name in which it is drawn the name of the acceptor and of the indorser who is also the drawer one and the same handwriting or not MR PARRY with whom was Messrs METCALPE and DEARSLEY objected no such question had hitherto been allowed to be put to a witness as it would in fact place him in the position of the Jury and be a usurpation of their functions See Doe v Suckamore Russells Evidence vol 2 page 819 and Hex v Shephard 1 Cock s Criminal Cases p 237 MR CLARKSON contended that this case differed from those quoted inasmuch as it was not a case of comparison of writing the document before the witness being in evidence in the case but that it was a question of the competency and right of the counsel for the prosecution to put a particular question to the witness MR BALLANTINE on the same side maintained that the best evidence should be given on the subject and that the best evidence in this case was scientific evidence a scientific opinion could be applied to writing as well as to any other branch of evidence there could be no restriction as to what was scientific evidence and this case did not differ from one in which a butcher might be called to prove the manner in which an animal had been ad up or a surgeon to prove that certain wounds were produced either by the same or by a different instrument in which cases the Jury might have the same opportunity of examining the animal or the wounds as the butcher or the surgeon yet would be allowed to have the assistance of a scientific opinion and further that a case might arise in which it would become necessary to call Mr Netherclift to prove that the same pen inscribed the whole of a document which would yet be matter for the Jury to consider The COURT was of opinion that the evidence could not be received that the question involved neither more nor less than a comparison of handwriting ANTONIO MARTHAY I am a native of Spain and am acquainted with the State of Nicaragua in South America I have resided there at several periods and have been familiar with the State during four or five years—I resided personally in the State last year for four months—the capital of the State is at present Leon I last came from Nicaragua in the month of June and arrived in this country in the middle of Aug —I had been there six weeks at that time—I am connected with a house in Liverpool as a merchant—I never heard of such a firm as Francis Bottin and Co —I am connected considerably with the merchants of that place—if there had been such a firm there I think it is very likely I should have heard of it COURT Q Is there any city called Nicaragua in the State A Yes but the Government call it Rivers I am not familiar with that place I have been there Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q What is the length of voyage between here and Nicaragua A By the West India steamers it is five or six weeks you land at Great Town and go up the river in boats or crafts—it takes from a week to a fortnight to go up it depends on the state of the river and the weather—a sailing vessel to Great Town alone would take six or seven weeks six weeks I should consider a good time from an out-port in England JOSEPH WALLOD policeman I took Coleman into custody on 30th July—I took this paper produced from his pocket-book which was in his pocket THOMAS BALCHIN City policeman 618 I took Gurney into custody on 30th July—I took these four papers from his desk in his office at 38 St Mary at Hill—he had given me his address there—I found a key on him with which I opened the door of the office—the desk was unlocked MR ISAACS re-examined These two papers are in the writing of Coleman—this third I believe to be in Gurney s writing and the fourth in Coleman s Letters read H 25th July 1852 Dear Sir —We are in receipt of a letter from Mr Birch of Antwerp and will feel obliged if you will favour us with a call Coleman and Bottin — I To Francis Bottin and Co Nicaragua Mr Coleman is the son of the late Mr Coleman of the firm of Coleman and Chapman of Liverpool — J July 29th 1852 To E Isaacs Esq Sir —We hereby give you notice that a bill dated Nicaragua for 187l 18s 9d drawn by Francis Bottin and Co in our favour and accepted by Messrs Coleman and Bottin of 59 Mark-lane has been fraudulently obtained from us without any consideration and you are hereby cautioned from making use of such bill in any shape whatever Joseph Gurney and Co — K 26th July 1852 Mr Henry Birch Dear Sir —The inclosed bill for 187l 18s 9d is on Messrs Coleman drawn by Francis Bottin and Co at ninety days sight which we authorize you to negotiate and hand over the proceeds to us according to arrangement between us Yours truly Joseph Gurney and Co COLEMAN— GUILTY GURNEY— GUILTY Aged 60 Transported for fifteen years 
t18521025-1036  1036 WILLIAM MARTIN and EDWARD GRAVES forging and uttering a request for the delivery of a few pairs of bracelets MR ROBINSON conducted the Prosecution JULIUS WILLIAM MARTINS I am clerk to Messrs Wild and Robinson I know the prisoner Martin—he was in the employ of Messrs Wild and Robinson—he was errand boy there and he likewise used to sell goods and put the sales in the book—we had a customer named Troup—Martin would have the opportunity of knowing that Mr Troup was a customer and of seeing his handwriting—we were in the habit of furnishing goods to Mr Troup on orders similar to this produced —Martin left in June last—on 28th Sept I saw the prisoner Graves about 4 o clock in the afternoon—I am not quite sure that that was the first time I had seen him that day—about 11 that day this order was presented to me—I believe by his general appearance it was Graves who brought it but I cannot swear whether it was him or not—I gave the order to Mr Wild and he gave the bracelets to the person who brought the order—I am acquainted with Martin s handwriting—both these orders looking at them are in Martin s handwriting to my best belief Cross-examined by MR PULLEIN Q You were well acquainted with Martin s handwriting A Yes I saw him write nearly every day—it depended on business whether he wrote much—he wrote in the day book and the approbation book—he had not to write letters—he wrote very small orders to merchants in town—there was other writing besides figures in the day book—there were articles that were sold such as six bracelets so much and so on—sometimes there were large orders—besides writing in the day book and approbation book he wrote little letters to merchants in town—he was not a clerk—when I went there Mr Wild called him errand boy—when this order was presented I called Mr Wild and gave it him—I did not read it—I knew it was an order because the person who brought it said From Mr Troup —I called Mr Wild and gave it him—I was busy—on my oath I did not read it—I rose from my desk and wont to him and he said From Mr Troup I called Mr Wild who was in the adjoining parlour and gave it him—I had it from the person who brought it and kept it till Mr Wild came—on my oath I did not read the order—I have been in the employ of Messrs Wild and Robinson one year—I kept the day book and approbation book—I wrote in the day book and Martin wrote in it and Mr Wild and Mr Robinson also—I do not lock that book up—no one writes in the ledger except me—I keep the approbation book the ledger the cash book and day book—there is only one errand boy there at a time—Martin was there—he and I were very friendly—I never called him clerk and he never called him-self clerk—I called him by his name—I treated him very friendly—I never had any quarrel with him that I remember—I had not repeated quarrel with him—in business I sometimes told him not to do this or that but I did not quarrel—I did not order him about—I can say on my oath that Mr Wild or Mr Robinson never told me that Martin was to have my place when I left—Martin was once talking about it—I do not know that he was to have my place when I left—he could not he cannot speak German—I cannot tell whether I was permanently engaged by Messrs Wild and Robinson when I entered there—I was paid by the week—neither Mr Wild or Mr Robinson ever told me that I was engaged there merely to make up the books—I was generally engaged there—I found Martin there when I went—I remained there till he left in June—I was there from Oct last year—no other person stood between Martin and my employers except myself—there was no other clerk or shopman—before I went there Mr Robinson kept the ledger—I am a native of Poland I have been in this country about two years and a half—I had been in various situations before I got to Messrs Wild and Robinson s —I had been interpreter at an hotel and I gave lessons in French and German and I was barman at a public house in Turamill-street Clerkenwell Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q This order was presented about 11 o clock and you would not swear that Graves brought it A No I was brought to Union-court about 4 and I saw Graves—I shook my head and walked away and I did not appear the first time before the Magistrate—on the second occasion Graves s mother did not tell me but Graves told me to come MR ROBINSON Q Why did you shake your head A Because I was not quite sure it was him—I said I shall send for the boy —my wages were much more than Martin s—he was in the habit of writing the sales in the day book and it would be his duty to enter orders at times when I was away CHARLES WILD I am a partner in the establishment of Wild and Robinson Martin was in our service up to last June—before be left I received a communication from a policeman and I made a communication to Martin—I recollect this document looking at the order being brought on 28th Sept —I believe ft is Martin s writing—the name on it resembles Mr Troup s writing but not the other part—this was delivered to me by Mr Martins our clerk—I did not see him receive it but I heard the door go and the party asked for some bracelets for Mr Troup—I selected the bracelets myself and gave them—I had no doubt at the time that it was Mr Troup s order—I could not swear who brought the order but from his general appearance I believe it was Graves—it was a person of his general appearance and his size—the value of the goods I delivered to him was about 7l —our errand boy was in the shop at the time he is here Cross-examined by MR PUELLEIN Q You had no doubt about it being Mr Troup s order A No I executed it immediately—I did not make a memorandum on the back of it—I could not say whether there was writing on the back of the order or not—I did not take further notice of it—I had not the slightest doubt it was for Mr Troup nor had I after executing the order—I first noticed the order about 1 or 2 o clock the same day—I could not say whether there was then any writing on the back of it I looked at the front of it—I do not recollect whether I looked at the back—I can swear I looked at the front—that was the first time that I believed it was not Mr Troup s writing—when I executed the order I had no doubt of its being Mr Troup s writing—I had been in the habit of seeing Martin write sometimes in the day book and sometimes in the approbation book according to business—I suppose he is about eighteen or twenty years old—he had been in our service about three years and a half—we paid him at first 5s a week—he could not write well at first he improved in his writing—I did not examine his writing every month—my attention was directed to this order about 1 or 2 o clock I and Martins my clerk talked the matter over—we did not look much at the entries in the day book—we looked at ones at the writing to compare it—Mr Martins had not the slightest doubt about the writing and I had no doubt about it myself when we found that the order was forged when we found that the bracelets had not been for Mr Troup—I had no great conversation with Mr Martins—he said That is our boy s handwriting and I agreed with him—I thought so myself—Martin had asked for an increase of wages and we granted it—he had at last 10s a week—he came at 9 in the morning and left at 7 or 8 in the evening according to business—on some occasions he has stopped till 12 at night—sometimes he had a great deal of outdoor work—he sometimes had a great deal to do at the Custom House—there has been no dispute at all at the Custom House about our entries—we sent Martin to the Custom House to be careful that the goods were not broken in taking out and in—he did not pass entries our broker does all that—he asked for an increase of salary and it was increased—he asked once more before he left for something beyond the 10s —that was not immediately before he left to my recollection—I hardly can say when was the last time we raised his salary I believe it was last year—I could not say exactly the time he asked for an increase I believe a mouth or two before he left MR ROBINSON Q You say when you first saw this order you believed it came from Mr Troup how was it you did not find out that it was not his writing at once A I did not examine it at once it is generally done in business—I delivered the goods without examining it—after I had examined it I had no doubt about it—my judgment was not formed from what Mr Martins said to me DAVID BRICKLEY I am errand boy to the prosecutors On 28th Sept I recollect this paper being brought—I believe this to be the one looking at it —the prisoner Graves brought it—I have no doubt whatever that he was the person—it was given to Mr Martins and he gave it to Mr Wild—I never saw Graves before—I saw him again about 4 o clock that afternoon I recognised him again as soon as I came close upon him Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q You are in the service of Messrs Wild and Robinson A Yes and have been about eight weeks before that I was an errand boy in Whitechapel—this order was brought between 11 and 12 o clock—I was in the back part of the shop as far as I am now from you—I was on one side of the counter and Graves was on the other—I was directly opposite him—I never saw him before—I cannot describe his jacket—I know he had a blue striped shirt on and a grey sort of cap which came on one side—Mr Wild was in his parlour—I saw him speak to the person and I saw him give him the bracelets—from the time Mr Wild came from the parlour and executing the order he was about a quarter of an hour—he only asked him who he came from and told him to sit down—I afterwards saw Graves at Union-court about 4 o clock—the officer Green took me there—the officer came to Mr Wild s for Mr Martins first and when he came back he came for me—the officer told me he was taking me to recognise the prisoner he took me to the court—Graves was sweeping the court with a cigar in his mouth—Mr Martins told Mr Wild that he could not recognise him and then the officer took me to recognise him—he told me I was going down to recognise him MR ROBINSON Q Mr Wild asked him who he came from what did he say A From Mr Troup NELSON RICHARDSON I am in the employ of Mr Troup 36 Hatton-garden he is a jeweller and watch maker This order is not his writing nor mine nor anybody s in our establishment—this other order is not Mr Troup s writing Cross-examined by MR PULLEIN Q Are the orders sent by Mr Troup indorsed in any way A They are not JOHN TROUP I carry on business in Hatton-garden These documents are not in my handwriting—I did not authorise any person to send for these things Cross-examined by MR PULLEIN Q Are all your orders signed by you A No by the clerks in general and they put their initials on them—I have live persons in my establishment—I have not had more than eight or nine fox the last two years—my errand boy does not send orders—he is deputed to fetch orders in but not to write MR ROBINSON Q In your business who would have authority to send orders A The last witness chiefly when orders are given in my name they write For John Troup in full or J Troup and then their own initials COURT Q Would any person who has been in the habit of signing orders for you be aware that this was not the proper form A Yes I think so DAVID CURRIE I am clerk to Mr Keller 88 Hatton-garden On 28th Sept about 12 o clock a person presented this request—I believe it was the prisoner Graves—I have no doubt he is the person—I had never seen him before—he brought the order in and we were engaged with another customer—I took the order myself—he said he came from Mr Troup—I told him we would send the goods—he said Send the goods immediately there is a customer waiting to see them —Mr Keller was not quite satisfied and he went to Mr Troup s Gross-examined by MR RIBTON Q You believe it was Graves A Yes I have no doubt of it—I never saw him before—I saw him again at Union-court the same day—I went at the request of Mr Green the officer—he asked me if I could recognise him—when I saw him in Union-court I saw his side face and I could not recognise him—I went for Mr Wild and he was not at home—I saw Graves again at the station the same day and then I could recognise him—I expressed a conviction that it was him but to swear positively without shadow of a doubt I could not—I had no doubt—when I looked him full in the face I considered it was him COURT Q Tell us what opportunity you had of seeing him in the shop A I was standing directly opposite the door when he came in—I took the order from him and turned to Mr Keller and asked him if we had not better send the goods as we were busy and he said Yes —I was about two feet and a half from Graves the width of the counter—he was there three or four minutes—the window is at the end of the counter—I cannot describe his dress particularly I know it was a cap he had on LEOPOLD KELLER I am a jeweller and importer and live at 88 Hatton-garden—I received this order on 28th September about a quarter past 12 o clock—it was brought by a person similar to the prisoner Graves—I believe be is the person—I could not swear positively—I was at home when the order was brought I had very shortly before come into my house—just before I came in I had seen the prisoner Martin standing at the corner of Hatton-garden and Cross-street I knew him perfectly before—he might be about eighty steps from my door—when I got within about twenty steps of him he saw me and turned his back—when I got past I turned and looked at him—he was looking towards Hatton-wall in the direction of Wild and Robinson s—it might be about a quarter of an hour after I saw him that this order was presented by Graves Cross-examined by MR PULLEIN Q When did you first mention about seeing Martin A At the Police-court at Bagnigge Wells—I bad before mentioned it at Messrs Wild and Robinson s and to my clerk—I mentioned it first about 2 o clock—I went to Messrs Wild and Robinson s when I found my order was forged—I there saw Mr Martins—they were not talking about these things—I asked them if they had received a similar order and the order was fetched—I will swear it was on 28th September about 2 o clock—the time I saw the prisoner Martin was about 12—it was about a quarter past 12 when the order was brought—I saw Martin about twenty steps before I came to him—I did not take particular notice of his dress—I merely looked him in the face—I believe he had a blue coat on I am not quite sure—he did not say anything to me he turned round—I had known him about three years and a half I had not been in the habit of speaking to him—I have sometimes asked him how Mr Wild was—I used to nod to him—I did not nod this time because he turned round—I have no ill feeling against him Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q You cannot swear it was Graves A No COURT Q Had you ever had any dealings with Mr Troup A Yes I knew Martin before—he used to bring the newspaper to my house almost every morning—I knew him as errand boy to Messrs Wild and Robinson—he had brought messages from Messrs Wild and Robinson—he never brought orders from Mr Troup—this was on a Tuesday CHARLES AYRE I am errand boy to Mr Keller I was in the shop on 28th September—I saw the young man bring a paper and he said he came from Mr Troup—I am almost sure that Graves is the person Cross-examined by MR PULLEIN Q Do you know the day of the week A I asked the young man what day of the week it was and he said it was Tuesday—it was raining—I do not know that it poured with rain—I am not sure whether it rained all day—people were running about with umbrellas and some standing up at the houses Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q How long was he in the shop A Three or four minutes—I walked round the side of the shop by the counter and looked up at him—I saw him afterwards at the police-court—I went to Mr Wild and said Shall I go with you to the police-court to see if I can recognise the man —and I went with him—I saw Graves at the police-court—he was called and I saw him come in and I said it was him MR ROBINSON Q Did you know him directly A Yes I said I thought that was him—it was raining fast the day he came—no one would stand outside by choice JOSEPH GREEN police-sergeant G 90 I know the two prisoners—I have seen them together before June I should say about five or six months—I had seen them together about a dozen times during that time—I had never seen Graves near Messrs Wild and Robinson s premises—I have known Graves the last five or six years—I had seen the prisoners together about a week or a fortnight before I took them in custody—I pasted over this order at the back by order of Mr Robinson the solicitor because it was torn—I do not recollect what was on the back of this order—there was some small writing something similar to what is on the back of this other order—on the back of this here is L Keller Cross-examined by MR PULLEIN Q You have seen the prisoners together since June A Yes I saw them together eight or ten days before I took them in custody—I know Martin to be the associate of Graves—I had seen him with him before—I did not have a row with Graves in April a personal squabble—I might have met him in April in Union-court—I was engaged to find out these prisoners—I went to Martin s parents and turned over their goods and things—his father and mother are respectable persons in Fetter-lane—that is in the city—I had not any warrant with me—I had a City policeman at the door—I opened one box—I believe his mother to be honest I took her word for the rest—I found this one book which I have had ever since producing it MR ROBINSON Q What is Union-court A A low neighbourhood—I have seen the prisoners together at Graves mother s she is married to a man named M Donald MR RIBTON to CHARLES EYRE Q You told me you recognised Graves at the station how many times did you go to the station house A Two or three times I could not be sure which—I did not recognize him the first time—I was not sure—I was taken by the policeman to Clerkenwell-green to a place where prisoners are brought—I was shown Graves—he was not pointed out to me by the policeman—the policeman did not go up with me the turnkey did—the policeman did not tell me I should be sure to recognize Graves by means of his white buttons—he said to me Are they white buttons on his waistcoat I said I am not sure and he did not say any more—the policeman said to the turnkey that I had come to recognize a prisoner—the policeman did not say I should be sure to recognize him—he asked me if I could and I said yes—after I had been to the prison I was brought to the police station—I went to Bagnigge-wells the next day and I recognized that the man I saw at the station was the same man I had seen at the prison at Clerken well—I saw two little boys and another person like a Frenchman and the fourth one I said was him—I did not notice his buttons I knew him by his face COURT Q Those persons at the prison were shown to you separately A Yes they were in a little place the turnkey said to me Is that him —is that him —he asked me that of each of them JOSEPH GREEN re-examined Q What dress bad Graves on A A kind of grey cap a blue surtout coat and a check shirt I think it was blue stripe THOMAS JONES policeman G 165 I

t18521122-38  38 DAVID LEWIS alias Allen see page 19 feloniously and knowingly uttering a forged note with intent to defraud the Governor and Company of the Bank of England MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution THOMAS SAUNDERS I am foreman to Mr Harris a stationer at 39 St John-street Clerkenwell I have known the prisoner fifteen or sixteen years but had lost sight of him for very nearly two years—I knew him first by the name of Watson and afterwards by the name of Allen—he has been a schoolmaster—on 4th Oct about a quarter before 9 o clock in the evening he came to Mr Harris s shop—I saw Tripcony the shopman serving him—I made out an invoice of the goods be ordered—they consisted of copy books slates and various spelling books three of each kind as if he was going to open a school—I asked him if he was going to open again he said Yes and he wished me to bring him up some maps—I asked him where and he said To the old place —I asked where did he mean Castle-street he said Yes —I knew him to have carried on business in Castle-street as a schoolmaster—I do not recollect the number I think it was 36—I asked him if I should bring the parcel home he aid Never mind —he said he wished to give us a turn as we had lost a good deal of money by him—I asked him what name he said Oh Allen —I knew him by the name of Watson in Castle-street—I think the goods came to about If 1s 10d —after I had made out the invoice and whilst the goods were being packed he asked me if I could change him a 5l note—he had got his hand in his pocket at the time junking some money—I said to Tom one lad who was serving him You have not change for a 5l note have you —he said No I have not Sir —upon that I told the prisoner I would get him change—he said No never mind I have got money —he had the note in his hand and I fancy he put it in his pocket again—I supposed it was a 5l note but I did not take it out of his hand to look—just at that time Mr Harris came in—the prisoner said How do you do Mr Harris I am going to open school again and I wish to lay out a little ready money I know you have lost a little by me before and I wish to lay out my ready money with you —he said Have you got the difference of a 5l note Mr Harris said Yes certainly —the prisoner then gave him a 5l note this produced is it—he handed it to Mr Harris and he gave him change—the prisoner had ordered some maps we had not those maps in stock and I said I would bring them to him on the Thursday or Friday—when the parcel of slates and books was made up I said I would send them up next morning he said Never mind I must take them myself —he said he was in a very great hurry and he should want them very early in the morning—on receiving his change he took the parcel and went out—in three or four minutes afterwards Mr Harris thought he had made a mistake in the change and sent Tripcony after him—he was absent about ten minutes and then returned without the prisoner but with the parcel which the prisoner had taken—I did not see the prisoner again until he was in custody—on the following day I went with Archer the constable to the house in Castle-street where I knew the prisoner had carried on business—I did not find him there he was not living there—I made inquiries and could not find anything of him WILLIAM HARRIS I am a stationer of 39 St John-street Clerkenwell I have known the prisoner sixteen or seventeen years—on 4th Oct near 9 o clock in the evening I came in and found him in my shop—after some conversation he asked whether I had change of a 5l note I said Yes certainly —I went behind the counter and he produced the note out of his pocket and laid it on the counter—I asked him what change he wanted and I appealed to my foreman who is my half brother he said You are to take 1l 1s 10d and I gave him 3l 18s 2d —this is the note—he took the parcel wished me good night and went away—I put the note into my pocket—I had no other 5l note by me at that time—as soon as he was gone fancying I had given him a sovereign too much I sent Tripcony after him—he returned in about ten or twelve minutes with the parcel but without the prisoner—in consequence of what I learned from him I marked the note—this is what I wrote on it David Allen Oct 4 1852 —I believe that is the prisoner s correct name—next morning I sent the note to the Bank and it was returned to me stamped Forged as it is now—I then delivered the note to Archer the constable and gave him a description of the prisoner—I saw nothing more of the prisoner until 2nd Nov at 7 in the evening when I went to the Bagnigge Wells police station and found him there—I there charged him with uttering the forged note I said Mr David Allen you are caught at last —he said that misfortunes had been showering upon him so thick that he did not care what became of himself—next morning previous to going before the Justice the prisoner sent for me—I asked him what he wanted with me he said Will you be satisfied if the amount of the note is made up to you and Shepherd s bill and not prosecute —I said What do you mean have you got the money he said No but I can give you good security —I said That will not do that is quite enough —he said Will you hear what I have got to say for I declare to God that when I planted that note upon you I was almost starving —nothing else passed—I then went before the Magistrate Prisoner Q How long have you known me A Sixteen or seventeen years—I cannot say that your dealings with me have always been strictly honourable—there was nothing dishonourable about Shepherd s bill COURT Q Then except that transaction was his dealing always honourable A Well he owed me money before that and told me he had passed through the Insolvent Court—I did not take the trouble to ascertain about that Prisoner Q At the time of Shepherd s bill did not I voluntarily offer to pay you what I was in debt to you at the time and did not you deduct that sum from the amount of the bill A Yes that is correct—you did not take Shepherd s bill on my recommendation—I told you I had known Mr Shepherd for many years and he was a highly respectable man—you had had the bill in your possession a month before you made the inquiry of me—I believe you have come to me since then when you wanted stock and laid out your ready money with me THOMAS TRIPCONY I am shopman to Mr Harris I remember the evening of 4th Oct when the prisoner came for some goods—in consequence of instructions from Mr Harris I went out after him and overtook him facing Nicholson s distillery in St John-street—I tapped him on the shoulder and said Mr Allen Mr Harris thinks he has made a small mistake in your bill will you be kind enough to step back with me —he said Yes —he then said Have you got the bill —I said no I believed he had got it in his pocket or else it was in the parcel—he turned round to return with me—he asked me to carry the parcel it was rather heavy—we had not got a dozen steps before he asked me that—I took it from him and we went on as far as Compton-street he then said to me Just wait here one minute while I go round the corner to ease myself —I waited perhaps three or four minutes—he went round the corner—finding he did not return I went round the corner to seek after him and found he had disappeared—I waited altogether perhaps ten minutes and then went back with the parcel to my employer and communicated to him what had happened Prisoner Q When Mr Harris was at the till about to give me my change and he passed the note across the counter to you where did you take it A He did not pass it to me—he did not send me out of the shop with it—I did not go out of the shop till after you went out—I did not leave the shop while you were there GEORGE HENRY COOPER I live at 36 Castle-street Oxford-street I have lived there about eight months—the prisoner has not lived there at any part of that time or carried on any school there—I never saw him till this day JOHN ARCHER policeman G 217 No 36 Castle-street is the house I went to JAMES BARTON I am one of the inspectors of notes at the Bank of England—the note produced is a forgery in every respect the paper the engraving the stereotype and all Prisoner s Defence written On 4th Oct I went to the shop of Mr Harris with whom I had dealt seventeen years for the purpose of purchasing some school stationery I gave Mr Harris a 5l Bank of England note to pay for the things which he put into his trowsers pocket He went to the till to get change which he opened but before he began to count it out he took something out of his trowsers pocket and handed it to the shopman Tripcony which I believe to be the note I gave him who went out of the shop but did not return during the remainder of my stay which was five or six minutes After I had left the shop bearing somebody running behind me I turned round and observed Tripcony he said Mr Harris thinks he has made a mistake in your change I said Has he I do not think he has I turned back with him intending to go to the shop when we arrived at the corner of Compton-street having occasion to leave for a minute or two to attend to nature s call I requested Tripcony to hold the parcel I found that the bill contained my change and it was quite right and then remembering how I became possessed of the note the thought momentarily struck me that it might be a stolen note or something wrong about it accordingly through fear I did not return but proceeded homewards as to its being forged I had not the slightest idea of such a thing as I was not aware there was such a thing in existence and I having given change for it How I came possessed of the note was as follows on Saturday 2nd Oct I went out for the purpose of purchasing some school fixtures and took with me five sovereigns two half sovereigns and silver I met a person who was formerly a lodger of mine we went into a public house in the Borough and bad some refreshment we were nearly an hour and a half there during which time I got into conversation with some men who were standing drinking at the bar one of them asked me if I could oblige him with change for a 5l note he took from his breast pocket a pocket book out of which he took seven or eight notes and handed one to me saying he should feel much obliged to me if I would I replied Certainly and gave him four sovereigns and two half sovereigns in change for it which I should not have done had I been sober but I was intoxicated I partook of something to drink at his request I wrapped the sovereign in the note and asked Mrs Wilson my old lodger for a pin she gave me one and I pinned it in my watch fob we finished what we had and left the house Mrs Wilson going her way and I mine Had I known the note was a forgery is it likely I should have taken it to a person that had known me so long and who I might be sure would recognize me and recollect the transaction I do not know that the note produced is the same I gave to Mr Harris if it is it bears the marks of the pin holes if it does not it is not the same Mr Harris swore at the police court that he compared it with ten or fifteen others and is it not likely it might have got changed MARY WILSON I am a married woman living with my husband I know the prisoner his name is David Allen—I have known him by that name—I lodged with him in Castle-street Oxford-street just upon twelve months—it is about two years ago—he was then a schoolmaster—on 2nd Oct I met him about 9 o clock in the evening in the Borough—I went with him to a public house at the corner of Mint-street—I staid there about an hour and a half—I was drinking with him—I had one or two glasses of brandy and water—there were two or three men at the bar standing close by us—they got into conversation with the prisoner and they asked him if he would give them change of a 5l note—he said he would do so and he took four sovereigns and two half sovereigns out of his pocket and the man took a pocket-book out of his pocket and gave him a note and he gave them the money the four sovereigns and two half sovereigns—he asked me if I would give him a pin I did so and he took another sovereign out of his pocket wrapped it inside the note and pinned it inside his waistcoat—we had a glass of brandy and water with the men and came out—I wished him good night and came home Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q

upwards of two years by the name of John Gerrard—I was here at the Feb sessions of this Court—the prisoner was here then before his Lordship MR PARRY submitted that the way to prove that the prisoner

No 19 George-street Blackfriars-road my husband was Dr Wood he died at Christmas 1850 I knew the prisoner previously and after my husband s death he called on me commiserated my situation being without friends and offered his services to befriend me in any way he possibly could which I gladly accepted—I was entitled to 84l from a policy of insurance which my husband had effected at Glasgow—the prisoner received that for me I authorized him to do so—my father was a member of a merchant s house at Glasgow and I tried for an annuity of 20l under the merchants fund—I never exactly knew whether I was on the funds of that house the prisoner told me at one time that I wife on and at another time that I was off but he enclosed me 10s of the last quarter s money and until then I never knew positively that I was on the house—I cannot say whether he has paid over the whole of that sum to me for I never could get a reckoning with him—he has given me money in small sums from 1l down to 6d —I cannot swear altogether what he has given me but from 3rd Jan 1852 down to 5th Oct when he sent roe 10s received from the merchant s house I have received of him 14l 5s 10d —that was the last money I received of him—I was also entitled to some property in Bishop-street Glasgow it was coming to me from my grandfather and father I was unwilling to sell it as I did not know whether my brother was dead not having heard from him for three years—the prisoner seeing that I was in such poor circumstances said that if I would sell the property and purchase an annuity with it it would add considerably to my small income—I told him I would not do so as long as I did not know that my brother was dead and some two or three months afterwards he sent me a little scrap of paper in consequence of which I afterwards saw him and he said I could now sell the property to purchase an annuity—that was the sense of what he said I cannot exactly repeat the words—he said he saw a person in the Strand who told him he saw my brother die in New York—I think he said that by word of mouth—I arranged with him to sell the property he said the likeliest person to buy it would be the person who held two-thirds of it already and he sent a note for me to go to his chambers one day to sign the deed of sale—I went to his chambers signed some documents and 214l was paid over to me by the person who went away with the papers—after he went away I rolled up the money and was putting it in my reticule to take it home until he could look for an office for me to get the annuity—he said Oh don t do that it is very unsafe you may either lose it or the house may be on fire or anybody might know you had so much money —I said What shall I do with it —he said Put it into the bank he recommended the Commercial Bank I went there with him 210l was lodged there in the joint names of Wallace Harvey and Catherine Wood and 1 kept 4l for my immediate use—he said it must be secure because he could not take it out without my signature and I could not take it out without his and it would be my whole subsistence to depend on—when we came to the Temple gate we bid each other good bye and he asked me for the loan of one sovereign which I lent him—I gave the prisoner no authority to sign my name to any checks I knew nothing of his withdrawing the money till I went to the Bank—the signature Catherine Wood to this check is not my writing I never authorized the prisoner to sign my name to that check—this ft a good imitation of my writing— the check being read—dated 31st July 1851—Drawn on the Commercial Bank of London in favour of ourselves or bearer for 85l Signed W Harvey Catherine Wood —I did not give him authority to sign this other check for 25l dated 28th July or these of 8th Aug for 30l 9th Aug for 5l 16th Aug for 5l or 24th Sept for 5l making 210l nor were they drawn by my authority—I have received money from the prisoner which I thought came from the merchant s house but I was not aware that any portion of this money was withdrawn from the bank till I was there in July 1852—I owed some money to Mr Griffiths and it was in consequence of something communicated to roe by him that I went to the Bank Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q How long before your husband s death had you known Mr Harvey A About two years he was the only person who followed my husband to the grave—before my husband s death we only had what he earned to live upon—the prisoner has been in the habit of advancing trifling sums to me—I one day received 4d —I never heard my husband say he received 5s from him he never got more than half a crown from him—we had no claim on the prisoner—to me he never gave hut that one 4d in my husband s life time—as to my husband he got it himself and not I the small sums that he did get—my husband had known the prisoner many years and was medical attendant to his father s family—I do not think my husband received sums of the prisoner amounting to more than 1l that I was told of—I do not know that the prisoner was constantly in the habit of giving money in charity to my husband for us to live on—Dr Jordan said that my husband died of delirium tremens—the prisoner did not go to Scotland after my husband s death for me he was going to get married and he said since he should be there he would transact my business without charge—he did not pay for the funeral of my husband it was paid by 5l being borrowed of Mr Self and 5l of Mr Andrew Tennent of Glasgow—the prisoner did obtain money for me by way of charity from friends of my husband but he never handed it over to me—my husband died at Christmas 1850 since when I have over and over again received moneys from the prisoner—I never received money from the merchant s house in Glasgow the prisoner used to receive it for me but I never knew till this last time that I was on the house—the letter from the merchant s house is dated 4th Oct 1852 this is it— produced —when I received it I was certain that I was on the house—I got it from Mr Harvey enclosing 10s Q Just look at that book have you not repeatedly gone through these accounts with the prisoner A No I never saw this book before never till this time—I did not receive 1l from the prisoner on 5th Feb 1852 looking at another book —this book is where I dotted down the sums I received of the prisoner I put down everything I received of him from 3rd Jan last—all these sums of 1l that are down in this book from Feb to April I never received until you come to June when I received 1l which I is down in my book—it is from Mr Bain of the York Hotel and I received it pf the prisoner—I did get money up to June but in smaller sums to the amount of 14l 5s 10d —I used to receive money just when be chose to send—I had no other means of living except what he sent—I am sorry I did not keep any exact accounts of what I received from him in 1851 but he promised from week to week and from month to month to settle my affairs—I could not have got more than 12s a week from him in 1851 but I cannot swear to it—I mention 12s a week because of his saying always that I should not exceed that—I had no agreement with him at all I just got it as it suited him to send it—I am not aware and never was that the prisoner was in the habit of giving money every week to my husband that I swear—my husband was always earning something he used to write for magazines and articles of literature—I know Mr Arnold s girl named Charlotte she was in the habit of bringing me money I cannot say every week—she did not to the best of my knowledge bring money and give it to me before my husband s death but she has since if there were any money-matters between my husband and the prisoner it was between themselves and Charlotte did not bring it—I authorized the prisoner to receive the money from the merchant s house in Glasgow for me but I always understood he would send me a receipt to sign—I never signed any receipt I never authorised him to sign my name I expected to do that myself—he told me the merchant s house in Glasgow refused to let me have any money on account of my drunken habits—my habits are not drunken I never was a drunken woman—I was not intoxicated at the time of my husband s death for three nights I never had my clothes off my back waiting on him—when the 214l was paid to me the prisoner said it would fetch an annuity of 12s a week—he did not agree to pay me an annuity of 12s a week for my money he cannot produce any such agreement neither was it in words—his having to advance the annuity for the whole year was his own fault not buying the annuity at once—I swear I never did agree that he was to have the money and allow me 12s a week Q When Charlotte brought you the money after your husband s death did not she very often tell you that it was the annuity Mr Harvey was allowing you A No I do not suppose the girl knew—on 7th March 1851 I went down to Chiswick where the prisoner was residing I did not ask for 2l on my annuity—I went down on my landlady s account I did not get 2l I got 18d and a bottle of wine to give to my dying landlady COURT Q Did you see the prisoner when you went to Chiswick A I did it was on a Sunday—I asked him to come and settle with my landlady who was dying and raving about the money—he said he could not do it on the Monday but as sure as God made him he would settle my whole affairs on the Tuesday and I could settle with Mrs Griffith as I liked MR PARRY Q Do you know Mrs Hefferman the housekeeper to Mr Harvey A Merely by seeing her there—I did not tell her and the girl Charlotte that I had allowed Mr Harvey to use the money on condition that he was to allow me 12s a week would I talk to his servants —I never spoke to the woman about my affairs—on my oath I never saw this check of 24th Sep 1851 before it was presented at the bank—I did not before it was presented write with a dry pen over Catherine Wood nor to any document—whenever I put my name I put it with a penfull of ink—I did not deny to the clerk at the bank that I had ever signed my name there was a mistake about it I gave Mr Harvey no signature—I did not in general terms give him authority to sign my name to all checks and documents which were required except when he was at Glasgow he sent me the papers to sign but I never gave him authority to sign my name never— when I said I never gave him authority except when he was at Glasgow I meant I gave him authority there la transact my business—I do not know that he frequently signed my name to receipts from Glasgow I did not even know that I was on the house—I did not tell Charlotte on more than one occasion that I and my husband would have died of starvation if it had not been for Mr Harvey—I understand you now perfectly MR HUDDLESTON Q Just look at that letter of 13th Feb 1851 produced —did you receive that from Glasgow enclosing a paper for you to sign A Yes I signed it and sent it back to him letter read— Glasgow Feb 13 1851 My dear Mrs Wood I received your letter on Tuesday afternoon last and would have left on Wednesday had it not been that I thought by staying a day or two I should be able to settle your affairs I have been sadly put about for the last two days by Andrew Tennent having told me on Wednesday that he would be obliged to charge a professional account for the business he and his brother has done for you and Dr Wood I told him that both from what he himself had told me previously and from what Dr Wood and you bad always under-Stood nothing was to be charged for any business of the sort and that it would be a cruel thing to deprive the widow of the slender means which were now left to her I have consulted one of the chief writers here to day and I have taken certain steps which will prevent Andrew Tennent from getting payment from the Insurance Company of any money which he might charge in the way proposed There is one thing which I advise should be done at once with an authority from you I could get the Insurance Company or Dr Mackenzie to make an advance of as much money as would enable you to pay the debts which are standing owing to Mr Self Dr Beattie Mr Griffiths &c and if you would send me this authority by return of post without fail I would bring the money to London on Monday night If you do not do this I fear that Mr Andrew Tennent when I go away will try some scheme or other to defraud you of some portion of the money but if the Company first makes an advance to you of a portion of the money then Tennent can do nothing You had better ask a third of the reversion namely 84l 10s for you will require something considerable to pay off the various sums you owe and have something remaining and it is better to get as much as possible from the hands of the Company at once As to myself I will never charge you anything for any trouble I hare been at in doing anything for you and I can assure you that everything which I have at any time done for your husband or yourself has been done out of the purest feelings for your welfare I shall try and bring the title-deeds of the property in Anderston also with me I can tell you you have no one here who would do anything for you but myself I have got your name put on the Merchants House list of applications for a pension and I have got some of the first merchants here to speak for you and you are certain of getting on at the first meeting on the 5th of March 20l a year I found it unnecessary to send you any papers with reference to it I shall go to-morrow to Oswald-street to look after the old lady you mentioned You must sign the enclosed and forward it to me by return of post without fail else I shall be obliged to leave this without any money for you and you will not get it yourself by writing Don t fail Yours truly WALLACE HARVEY —P S I shall bring your things from Edinburgh —The prisoner has told me that he has received 84l 10s from the Insurance—I was to get 5l a quarter from the Merchants Fund but I understood it was not permanent—it was in 1851 that I first understood that I had got on the House I beard of hit getting the first 5l in June 1851—he said he had received 5l on my behalf but that from Mr Andrew Tennent speaking ill of me I was again off the House—I never heard again of his receiving any money for me from that fund till this last quarter not a farthing of it—I then received 5l —he wrote to me on 4th Oct —this is the letter produced which I received enclosed in another with 10s read— Glasgow 4th Oct 1852 Dear Sir —On my return from the country to-day I have found your favour of the 30th inst and I beg to hand you an order on Messrs Glynn and Co for 5l to be paid Mrs Wood The period of my holding office in the Merchants House expires to-morrow when a new election takes place and in future your letters will require to be addressed to my successor in office James Hannan Esq who will be chairman of the Merchants House during the next two years and in the mean time I shall band him your letter Signed J F CONNAL —After I received that letter I received 10s Front the prisoner—I had at that time discovered that he had withdrawn my money from the bank—I conceive my money was drawn out in July last—I saw nothing of the prisoner between July and Oct —I could not find him—I looked for him I went to his chambers constantly and many persons were staying there waiting for him—I did not write to him—when the 10s was brought with that letter I could not tell where he was—the girl Charlotte brought it I did not ask her where he was on that occasion I had previously asked her and she could not tell me—what I received in 1841 could not be more than 12s a week—out of the money he received for me from the Insurance Company and the Merchants Fund he did not pay me more than 12s a week for 1851 and t think I must have received 50l in 1852 I do not believe I have received more but I never summed it up—I never received any money from him for the 210l nor did he ever make any observation to me about paying me money for it COURT Q Who paid your rent during 1851 A I was indebted to my landlady for it and Mr Harvey out of the 84l 10s was to have paid her all off—he said he would see it paid hut he did not and I owe her 12l 10s for lodging as near as I can say—I and my husband together paid her 4s 6d a week it has been 3s 6d since bis death it was 3s 6d during 1851—if it was paid by anybody it was paid by the prisoner and should all along have been paid by him—when my husband died I owed I think about 20l —I do not know that Mr Harvey paid that because he paid by instalments EDWRD LITTLE I am cashier at the Commercial Bank of London in Henrietta-street Covent-garden In July 1851 the prisoner came to the bank—I can tell by the check what day it was looking at it it was the 26th Mrs Wood came with him—a joint account was opened in their names and a sum of 210l was paid into the bank on their joint account—Mrs Wood was present at the time it was paid in—do paying that sum in they left the bank—I next saw the prisoner I think about two hours afterwards—he presented this check for 25l purporting to be signed by himself and also by Mrs Wood—it had been arranged that both their names should appear on the checks—I produce several other checks—this one for 35l I also paid him and here are others for 85l 30l and three for 5l COURT Q You do not know who you paid them to I suppose A I can only say positively with regard to the first check for 25l that I specially marked in the book—they were all paid at our bank MR COCKLE Q Look at that letter did you receive that from the prisoner A I believe this letter came to the bank from the prisoner I did not receive it myself—I know the handwriting it is the prisoner s read House of Detention Monday night Gentlemen —My mind is in the greatest anxiety as you may well imagine with respect to the position in which I am placed Relying as I do upon your desire not to prosecute me I trust on being able between this and the day of trial to make arrangement with Mrs Wood for the reimbursement of the 210l To the lost moment of my existence will I feel the effect of what hat occurred with all my accounts scrupulously correct every item of them provable I have not from Dec 1851 to the present moment defrauded Mrs Wood of a farthing and all that I have now in hand is 5l 7s 6d besides the 210l The landlord says I owed him 10l but I am security by note of hand for him for more and I cannot owe him anything till I am released from the security As I told you before this case of alleged fraud about the checks arose from the simple fact of my expecting to be married the day before the very first of then was made payable and I did not know it would be called a new account Oh God how unfortunate a wretch I have been —I think these three letters produced are written by the prisoner— read—no dale—postmark Aug 25th 1851 Chiswick Monday morning My dear Mrs Wood —I have been confined to the house for the last two days but am now better I shall be up to see you to-night or to-morrow morning and call with some money I hope you are well Tours in haste W HARVEY —P S The annuity is now settled and only requires your signature — 9th Sept 1851 Middle Temple My dear Mrs Wood —I shall be over to see you to-morrow evening and you will require to come out the following day to settle up the affairs of the annuity I will pay you the balance of the 5l from the Merchants House I have not been in London for five days Yours truly W HARVEY — 13th Sept 1851 My dear Mrs Wood —I enclose half a sovereign which will do you till the beginning of the week when I will come over I will tell you some news when I see you the affair of the annuity is all now settled and only awaits your signature Yours truly W HARVEY Cross-examined Q Was this an account current or was it a deposit account A An account current the usual account when money is paid in and checks drawn—I do not recollect that Mrs Wood when this charge was preferred denied to me that she had ever signed her name at the bank—I saw her after the charge was made but I never beard her say so COURT Q When did you first see her after 26th July when the account was opened A I think a few weeks before the prisoner was taken into custody I do not know when it was it was in Sept 1852—that was the first time I had seen her since the account was opened at that time the money was all gone PATRICK MADDEN I am an occasional messenger at Clement s-inn—I have been employed by the prisoner to go on errands for him—I have taken checks from him to the Commercial Bank in Henrietta-street—these two checks for 85l and 55l I took to the bank and received for him and brought him back the money Cross-examined Q Have you taken money to Mrs Wood from time to time A I have I have not taken Post-office orders to her—I have taken several Post-office orders from the Money Order-office in the Strand snd I believe a portion of those money orders were for Mrs Wood—I have taken the cash from money orders to Mr Harvey and he has enclosed it in an envelope or letter and then I used to take and put them in the post—I have taken cash to Mrs Wood in 1851 and 1852 as well I believe— to the best of my recollection the first day of 1852 I took I think it was 3s or 3s 6d —it was all in small sums such a thing as half a crown—that was the first money I ever took MR HUDDLESTON Q What was the largest sum you ever took A I cannot say the largest sum I ever took—I have taken sums enclosed in a note—the largest sum I know of was about 3s 6d —of course I could not tell what was sealed up GEORGE GRIFFITH I am a lighterman and live at No 19 George-street Blackfriars-road—Mrs Wood lodges with me and has done so between five and six years—her husband died at my house—since his death I have seen the prisoner frequently at my house—daring that period I have received money from him on behalf of Mrs Wood s debt for lodging—I cannot exactly tell the sum but I suppose I have received something about 24l or 25l altogether—that leaves now due to me on account of Mrs Wood about 11l 3s or 4s —in Aug 1851 I was going to meet the prisoner at the Temple by appointment—he had made that appointment by letter—I went to his chambers he was not there and on my way back I met him in Fleet-street—he had some papers in his hand—I asked him for some money—he said Well I have not any but I will try to get you some —we went into a public house in the Strand and had a pint of ale—he then went and borrowed as he told me half a sovereign and he said I shall come and see you at 4 o clock I am coming over to see Mrs Wood for I have got the papers in my hand —in fact he said I have nothing more to do now than to get her signature to invest the money in security for her to buy an annuity —he had the papers in his hand and he said he was going to prepare what was necessary and at 4 o clock he would come over and let Mrs Wood know so that all that was required than was her signature for the purchase of the annuity—nothing was said about the money in the bank or about her drawing money from the bank—I do not think anything more was said about her signature to anything else—I cannot charge my memory with whether the prisoner said where he was going at that time—I believe he did say something about where he was going but where I did not ask him—the fact is I did not know at that time or until some time afterwards that Mrs Wood had any money in the bank Cross-examined Q Besides the 25l had Mr Harvey become security for 10l or 15l for you in reference to the debt or was that a private matter A That was quite a private matter—he merely knew me as the landlord of Dr and Mrs Wood—he used to come to the house occasionally prior to the death of Dr Wood—I did not know at all of his having frequently advanced money to Dr or Mrs Wood I knew nothing of their transactions—I cannot say that I can answer whether Mrs Wood was a person of temperate habits or not for I do not pay much attention to their general manners WILLIAM POCOCK policeman F 14 The prisoner was apprehended in Oct last by another constable I had been looking for him several days—I was not present when he was apprehended—I was present when he was brought to the station—the constable who apprehended him searched him—I produce a receipt—I found it at No 4 Apollo-court Fleet-street where I found the prisoner s two servants I found it with a number of other papers on the first floor—there was very little furniture in the room barely anything they had not a bed to lie upon MR LITTLE re-examined I think this paper is in the handwriting of the prisoner— read London 26th June 1851 I hereby acknowledge the receipt of the sum of 99l sterling being part payment of the sum of 230l sterling for which amount I hereby bind myself to sell and convey to Mr James Morrison of No 16 Bishop-street Anderston Glasgow that third portion belonging to me of the tenement situated there of which tenement the said James Morrison already owns and possesses the remaining two-thirds it being further hereby understood that the remaining amount of 131l sterling a fter deducting the costs of the charges for drawing up deeds of conveyance and searches for the validity of title by Messrs Marshall Hill and Hill writers West George-street Glasgow be transmitted to Mr Wallace Harvey my legal adviser here immediately upon the execution of such deed of conveyance Signed—CATHERINE WOOD JAMES BROWN policeman F 142 I apprehended the prisoner on 8th Oct at the Chancellor s Head public house Carey-street Lincoln s Innfields—I afterwards went to his lodging in Apollo-court Fleet-street with Pocock—he said he knew the prisoner had some acquaintance there—when I took him into custody I told him he was charged with forgery on the Commercial Bank Covent-garden—he said I deny it I know nothing about it MRS WOOD re-examined The signature to this receipt is not my handwriting—I never authorised the prisoner to put my name to it—the first time I saw it was in Pocock s hands after the prisoner was taken MR PARRY Q Did you not wish at this time in June 1851 to get an advance of about 100l on your property and did not you so state to Mr Harvey A No that I swear—nothing of the kind ever passed between me and him—I swear I did not authorise him to make any application or to try to obtain that sum in advance Witnesses for the Defence CHARLOTTE ARNOLD I was in the service of Mr Harvey I have been in his service three years last Oct In March 1851 I remember Mrs Wood coming to Mr Harvey s house—I was present when she came—it was in New Weston-street—Mr Harvey rung the bell—I answered it and he told me to tell my aunt to come up and be a witness to what passed between him and Mrs Wood and I was to come up too—I fetched my aunt and we came into the parlour and Mr Harvey then said This is a bank letter that I have received from Glasgow —he then signed his own name to this letter—and he signed Mrs Wood s name too—he then wiped the pen and gave it to Mrs Wood and told her to trace the dry pen over her name she did so and she remarked to my aunt that trouble had made her so nervous that she could not sign her own name and that she had given Mr Harvey power to sign her name and receive any moneys that came for her and that Mr Harvey was going to allow her an annuity of 12s a week and that she was going to lend him her money—she mentioned the sum 210l —she said she was going to lend him 210l and she said she wished it was thousands instead of hundreds for his being so kind to herself and her husband and that had it not been for him they should have starved—I remember Mrs Wood calling on Mr Harvey in Sept 1851 it was at his chambers COURT Q Were you there A Yes I used to go there and clean his chambers and do anything MR REED Q Have you any particular reason for remembering the month of September A Yes I remember Mr Harvey saying to Mrs Wood that the Exhibition would soon be closed and that he should take her to it—that was on this occasion COURT Q Just tell us what happened when she called A Mr Harvey took a book out of his writing desk and said to Mrs Wood This is the last 5l of the 210l she had not said anything before that nor had he that was when she came in—he was at home when she called—she went in to him—as soon as she came in he said How do you do Mrs Wood —she said Quite well I thank you Sir how do you do —he told her to be seated and he then sat down and produced this book and said This is the last 5l out of the 210l —she said Very well Sir —he said I will draw it out—he then wrote his own name in the book and he then said to Mrs Wood Shall I or you write your name Mrs Wood —she said No write it yourself as you always do —he then wrote Mrs Wood s name in the book wiped the pen and gave the book and the pen to Mrs Wood and told her to trace the dry pen over her name she did so—Mr Harvey then said to me You are a witness to what has passed between me and Mrs Wood —I said Yes —he then tore a leaf out of the book and put it in his pocket—that was the leaf he had been writing on—and he put the book back in his desk MR REED Q Do you know if that was a check book A Yet I have heard since it was COURT Q What happened when he had put the book into his desk A He asked Mrs Wood if she would take a glass of wine—she said she would—he told me to wash the glasses and he gave Mrs Wood a glass of wine and took some himself he then went out—Mrs Wood went out with him to go home MR REED Q Have you by the direction of Mr Harvey ever called on Mrs Wood A Yes I first called a few days after I came to Mr Harvey s that was in Oct 1850 that was when her husband was alive—I went to take a message for Mr Harvey a letter and some money in it I do not know what money it was—I gave the letter to Mrs Wood—from that time up to Oct in the last year I have been frequently by the direction of Mr Harvey to the house of Mrs Wood I have been on every occasion to take money and letters I have been three or four times a week—I mean regularly three or four times a week sometimes I would go for two days together and them I would not go for two days more—I always went three or four times every week—I took money on each occasion—I told Mrs Wood by the direction of Mr Harvey upon what account the money was given—I Used sometimes to say that it was her annuity at other times I took it and said I had brought it from Mr Harvey she used to say Tell Mr Harvey I am much obliged to him —I remember in June 1852 purchasing a receipt stamp—that was by the direction of Mr Harvey—I do not remember what year it was in exactly—I do not know what month it was in yea it was in June but I do not remember what year looking at the receipt I believe this it the stamp that I fetched it is just the same sort of stamp—I know for what purpose it was obtained—Mrs Wood came into the Temple in June I am sure it was June it was not last June it was the June before—Mrs Wood came to Mr Harvey s chambers it was about 2 o clock in the day I was there—the usual salutations passed and Mr Harvey said Now about this annuity I will send Charlotte for a stamp I went out fetched the stamp and brought it back Mr Harvey then took it and wrote something on it and Mrs Wood then signed her name to it and Mr Harvey then said he would give her the annuity of 12s a week—Mrs Wood told Mr Harvey to hurry the people in Glasgow to sell the property as soon as possible and Mr Harvey said very well he would—I remember taking a check book from Mr Harvey to Mrs Wood—that was in August 1851—he told me to tell Mrs Wood to look over the accounts and that I would call for it in the morning I delivered that message Mrs Wood said would I wait for it then—I said no I would call for it in the morning—she said Very well —I called for it next morning I saw her and she said I was to tell Mr Harvey that she had counted over the money and all was right—I remember on one occasion Mrs Wood lending Mr Harvey a sovereign—that was in July 1851 it was just by the Temple gate—I was there—I was waiting for Mr Harvey at the Temple gate his chambers were in Middle Temple-lane—Mrs Wood and Mr Harvey came through Temple Bar and when Mr Harvey saw me he said to me Oh I suppose you want some money —I said Yes he then said to Mrs Wood Lend me one of those sovereigns to give to Charlotte and I will go back to the bank and draw out 25l or 30l —Mrs Wood said Very well —she gave me the sovereign wished Mr Harvey good bye and went down Middle Temple-lane Mr Harvey went upstairs I went up to fetch a basket and saw Mr Harvey sit down and write something in a book and tear out a leaf and put it in his pocket—I returned the sovereign I went over to Mrs Wood with it the same afternoon—we were living at Chiswick at that time—it was my custom to come down to him for money if I had none at home and I had to go to Mr Harvey to bring some things down to Chiswick Cross-examined by MR COCKLE Q Where have you been living for the last few months A I have been living at No 3 Hampstead-street for this last month—since July I have been living most of the time in Apollo-court I do not know where Mr Harvey was living during that time—he was not living in Apollo-court with me and my aunt he used to come in of a day—he used to come in sometimes and stop for an hour or two—he was not to say living there he used to come in of a day—he did not sleep there I think he had his chambers for about two years—he has not given them up that I recollect—I was in the habit of going to his chambers I last saw him there about a month before he was taken into custody—I do not recollect when it was—I have seen him there since July I saw him there about a month before he was arrested—I have been there very frequently without finding him there—I have gone there to fetch letters which I have given to the prisoner after fetching them—I used to meet him at different places—sometimes he would appoint some street to meet me sometimes he would appoint by Waterloo-bridge and sometimes by Temple-bar—his chambers were in Middle Temple-lane—he never told me why he did not go himself I never asked him Q What wages did you receive from this man A 4l a year—I was to have received 4l a year—I last received money on account of my wages about a week before Mr Harvey was taken into custody—I did not then receive all that was due to me—he does not owe me money for anything else besides wages—my clothes are not in pawn for him—there was some of mine and my aunt s clothes in pledge—they were pawned for my aunt and myself—the tickets were found upon Mr Harvey I believe—I gave them to him—Mrs Wood has never asked me since July for the prisoner s address or where he was—I have never refused to give her his address she never asked me—I have never told her that I did not know where he lived or did not know his address—my aunt is here—I saw the name signed to the check in March 1851—I saw the prisoner put a name to it—at the time the prisoner was taken into custody my aunt had not a black eye—I did not see the prisoner taken—I did not hear anything said to my aunt about a black eye in the prisoner s presence by the officer or any one else MR PARRY Q As to these pawn tickets did you give them to Mr Harvey yourself A Yes that was for the purpose of redeeming them for me RHODA HEFFERMAN In 1846 I became housekeeper to Mr Harvey—I had previously lived as cook and housekeeper in various families in noblemen s families—I remember about 1849 Mr Harvey becoming acquainted with Dr and Mrs Wood—I knew the habits of Dr and Mrs Wood as regards temperance—I knew Dr Wood personally—I have frequently seen him—I have known Mrs Wood from that time—I have seen them very frequently come in an intoxicated state to Mr Harvey s and likewise in Essex-street Strand—I have repeatedly seen Mr Harvey supply Dr Wood with money and food in 1849 that was very frequent—the girl was employed to take it but I frequently made the parcel up—I have only taken it myself on one occasion—I remember about a sum of money of about 210l coming to Mrs Wood I always understood it was 210l —Mrs Wood has spoken to me of Mr Harvey s kindness to her—she told me that but for Mr Harvey they would have been starved and she particularly requested me to give her Mr Harvey s mother s address that she might write and say what a good son she had to keep them from starving but I did not do so Q Have you ever had conversation with Mrs Wood about some money that she had lent or advanced to Mr Harvey A I have it was in the Temple—it was about three weeks after I went to Chiswick which was on 9th May 1851 it was about the commencement or sometime in June I cannot speak exactly to the date—she told me she had lent Mr Harvey her money that she had placed it in his hands to act as he thought proper with and he was going to allow her 12s a week as an annuity and when he failed to do that he was to return her the 210l —nothing more passed at that time—she was always speaking of his kindness towards her and so forth—the property she was entitled to was at Glasgow Q Do you remember at any time being called by Mr Harvey to witness any signature A I do that was in Weston-street—I know it was in March and it was after Dr Wood s funeral and Mr Harvey then went to Scotland—I perfectly recollect that it was in March 1851—the young girl my niece and myself were called into the little back parlour—Mrs Wood and Mr Harvey were there—Mr Harvey said I wish you Mrs Hefferman to be a witness to a transaction between Mrs Wood and myself he then produced a letter and wrote her name in it—he then wiped the pen gave it into her hand and said Now Mrs Wood trace your name over what I have written —she did so observing to me at the time Mrs Hefferman the troubles I have had has made my hand shake so and so nervous that I cannot write and she said From this time I give all my affairs into Mr Harvey s hands as I consider it safer in his hands than in any one elses —he then said Charlotte you and your aunt are both witnesses to this Q At that time did you know whether Mrs Wood had disposed of her property or no A Not at the time that this paper came there—Mr Harvey told me it came from a merchant s house in Glasgow—to the best of my knowledge the property was disposed of in July Q You mentioned just now that in a conversation you had with Mrs Wood in June about her property that it was sold A That I am not aware of only she told me at one time she was going to sell it and then she told me that she had disposed of her property and that Mr Harvey was paying her 12s a week as an annuity—it was in June 1851 that she first told me she was going to dispose of her property and the property was disposed of in July I know that—I heard of its being disposed of in July and saw the money—I cannot recollect the exact date when she told me the property was sold but I think it was about the second week in July—we remained at Chiswick nine months—we went in 1851 and left finally on 11th last July—I remember Mrs Wood coming to Chiswick between May 1851 and July 1852 it was on a Sunday—the girl opened the gate—she said Charlotte your long-expected visitor is come at last —I was in the garden—I came and spoke to her and she said to me Do you think Mrs Hefferman that Mr Harvey has plenty of money to day for I want him to advance me 2l 8s for a particular occasion I require it for out of my annuity —those were the words as well as I can recollect—I lived in Weston-street at one time—that was before I went to Chiswick—Mrs Wood has to my knowledge frequently come to Mr Harvey to write letters for her and she has frequently left letters and small packets and said Ask Mr Harvey to open these and write letters for me in my name as he has done before and make them as much like a female hand as possible—I was not a witness on the occasion of her asking Mr Harvey to sign a check upon Glynn s—the girl told me she was a witness—I have frequently seen Mr Harvey give money before the death of Dr Wood—he has left money with me to give him at his chambers Q Do you remember a Captain White from Leith at any time calling at Mr Harvey s at Chiswick A I do he called and asked if Mr Harvey was at home—Mr Harvey was in town but I expected him home early—he remained about an hour and a half and on leaving he told me to say to Mr Harvey that Captain White had called that he had made all the inquiry he possibly could in the business that he wished and the only information he could obtain was that David Baine had left England and gone to America and that he was believed to be dead—I gave that message to Mr Harvey and he said Mr David Baine was Mrs Wood s brother —this was about the middle of July 1851 it was during the Exhibition—it was in July I know Q Have you at any time seen this book just look at it Holding up the one shown to Mrs Wood A I have I know it from this distance well it is a little book in which Mr Harvey used to put down the amounts he gave to Mrs Wood—I cannot tell when I first saw that book for I have seen it so frequently in his hands and when he used to send the girl with money he used to be putting down the sums—I could not swear that I ever saw it before Dr Wood s death but I think I did—I frequently saw it after his death—I have seen it from time to time in the prisoner s hands—I have seen him and Mrs Wood in the room and this book on the table when they have been speaking—I have seen that on several occasions Cross-examined by MR COCKLE Q Do you happen to know where this man has been living since last July A I do not I only know that he has had lodgings but I never was at his lodgings—I was his housekeeper and servant during all the time—some part of the time between July and his being taken into custody he was in the Temple—I went to see him in the Temple—the last time I went to see him in the Temple was last July—that was the last time I know of his being in the Temple and just the first week in August—he was living in town during August and September except one week that he was in the country COURT Q When he was in town do you know where he was lodging A Well Sir the fact is I never was at his lodging—he told me he was lodging near Bond-street at first and afterwards that he had taken a lodging in Catherine-street Strand but I never was there MR COCKLE Q Was he living with you in Apollo-court A Never he was never living at my house there—he was not in the habit of coming there every day—he was not lodging in such a place as that—he did not come there every day but he would come almost every day or every second day—I had not seen him for three days before he was taken into custody until that morning—he used to come to give me money to get food with—he used to come every day or every second day up to the time he was taken iuto custody except the time he was out of town—he came up to the time he was taken into custody—Apollo-court is a very short distance from Middle Temple-lane just opposite—my niece was in the constant habit of going from Apollo-court to the Temple every day for letters—sometimes she brought them to him there and sometimes he would say Charlotte go and get my letters and meet me with them Q How many times has Mrs Wood applied to you for the prisoner s address A For his address Sir I can only say she never asked me for his address she always knew where to find him it was for his mother s address she asked me she never asked me for his address that I can swear—I refused to give her his mother s address I never refused to give her his address—I refused the mother s address without the sanction of Mr Harvey—I told him of it afterwards and he said I did right Q You have said you are his housekeeper and servant when did you last receive any wages from him A Oh that was a matter I always trusted to Mr Harvey—he has given me money as I have required it to purchase clothing but I always believed in Mr Harvey s honesty of intention towards me that when he got on in his profession he would pay me for all—I was constantly in the habit of receiving money from him for clothing and food up to the very morning he was taken—I have never had any regular wages from him—I have received some pounds from him I always left it in his hands—it was an understood thing I was not pressed for money exactly—I received some money from him on the very day before he was taken into custody that was for food and clothing—I have received pounds and pounds from him in the course of six years—I have not been in the habit of lending him money lately not within the last six or nine months—I have not had it in my power if I had if it was thousands I would have lent it to him or given it to him—I have not lent him money within the last twelve months—I have applied to him for money within that time when I required it—I repeat the answer that if I had thousands I would lend it to him or give it to him if I had it at this moment Q Why have you not accused him of ruining you A Oh never —ruining me never Q Answer yes or no—Have you never accused him of ruining you by his drunkenness and extravagance A Oh words which might have been spoken when there was words between me and the girl and he took her part COURT Q The question is Did you ever say so A I might possibly—I am of a warm disposition and I might have said it MR COCKLE Q You might have said that he had ruined you by his drunkenness and extravagance A I might have said such a thing I do not always stand upon what I say when I am warm Q Did not you charge him with breaking your bonnet A Oh that is nothing perhaps I might have made a claim upon him for breaking my bonnet and knocking me down—it was my fault the young girl was impudent to me and Mr Harvey came in at the time I obstructed his passing out and he pushed me I deserved it I know—I swear positively that was the occasion of it—the policeman asked me some questions and if he is in Court he can tell you the same there he is I know him—I told him that I obstructed Mr Harvey s going out—I had no black eye it was merely a push he gave me I told the policeman I had had a push—when he asked me who gave me the black eye I told him that I had obstructed Mr Harvey in going out at the door and he pushed me Q Did you say anything about your refusal to sign papers for him A To sign papers for him —well let me recollect do not be in such a hurry you ask me so many questions—yes yes I know perfectly—I will answer you Q Did you tell the policeman that it was because you refused to sign a paper for him A It was just that—I offended him because he made out a lot of scribbling papers and said Sign this and I said No I will sign no such stuff put it in the fire —it is possible I might tell the policeman that—I did not tell him that was the reason I was struck and my bonnet broken—I certainly did not tell the policeman that the reason why I had been assaulted and my eye blackened and my bonnet broken was because I had refused to sign some papers which the prisoner wished me to sign—I could not say such a thing—the night before this occurred he pushed me Q What did you mean then by saying just now that there was a parcel of papers which you would not sign A Well I say a few—nothing but papers of our own it was wages and his own affairs and he was writing all this stuff down and I accused him of cruelty—I was certainly angry because he pushed me—I refused to sign a paper about my wages COURT Q Let me understand—Were you asked by him to sign a paper about your wages A I was and I refused to sign it—it was not then that he struck me that occurred the night before he did not strike me he pushed me MR COCKLE Q Did you see the person who came to give information about Mrs Wood s brother s death A Yes that was the only day I ever saw him—he told me that Mr Harvey knew his address where to write to him MR PARRY Q You say that you had some dispute with the prisoner and that you are rather of a warm disposition A I am Sir very warm—the prisoner has always dealt most honourably by me—I think I should know Mrs Wood s handwriting I have seen her handwriting—sometimes she was in the habit of having other persons to write for her HENRY JOHNSON I am a grocer and teadealer residing at No 152 Surrey-street Blackfriars I do not know Mrs Wood—I have not got any Post-office orders here—I was not desired to bring them they are not in my possession—here is the notice I received producing it the books in which they are entered are in actual use I could not bring them The witness was desired to fetch them HENRY JOHNSON re-examined I have brought the books— looking at a book on 25th Oct 1851 I paid a Post-office order from the office No 254 Strand for 5s —on Ist Nov another for 4s —one on 4th Nov for 15s —one on 8th Nov for 1l —one on 15th Nov for 4s —one on 17th Nov for 3s —one on 29th Nov for 4s and one on Dec 11th for 4s COURT Q Does your book show who received it A The orders are all signed Catherine Wood —the entry in my book is Catherine Wood she would not sign the book but the order MR PARRY to CATHERINE WOOD Q Have not you taken at least twenty or thirty orders to Mr Johnson s A I cannot say to the number I took a good many—I do not recollect whether I received 1l by Post-office order from the prisoner on or about 8th Nov 1851 or 15s on the 4th or 15s on 11th Nov 1851—in Sept 1852 I received 15s COURT Q Have you received between 6l and 7l by Post-office orders A I have Q Some time in March last year 1851 when the prisoner was living in Weston-street did you go to his house and in a room in which Mrs Heffer-man and the girl Charlotte were present hear the prisoner say to you This is a bank letter I have received from Glasgow and sign his name to the letter and yours too and did he then wipe the pen and give it to you and tell you to put the dry pen over the name A I never was in Weston-street nor were those women in my presence in any business transaction with Mr Harvey Q In Sept following were you at the chambers of Harvey when he took a book out of his writing desk in the presence of the girl who is here and said This is the last 5l out of the 210l and did you say Very well and did he then write his name in his own book and say to you Shall you or I write your name in the book and did you say No write it yourself as you always do A Never such a thing never passed—I never signed the receipt which I have already spoken to I do not know for what purpose it could have been drawn up—I did not tell the housekeeper about 1st June that I had placed my money 210l in Mr Harvey s hands and that he was to allow me an annuity of 12s a week never Q Did you go one Sunday to Chiswick and tell Mrs Hefferman you wanted Mr Harvey to advance you something out of your annuity A I never saw Mrs Hefferman that Sunday—I never went to Mr Harvey and asked him to write letters for me and ask him to make them as much like a female hand as possible I can write my own letters John May a surgeon William Matthew Shepherd a surgeon and Edward Enfield Ballard physician of St Thomas s-street Borough gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 30 — Transported for Fifteen Years There were other indictments against the prisoner

t18530103-197  197 WILLIAM MARKS feloniously uttering a forged 5l Bank of England note with intent to defraud MESSRS CLARKSON and BAYLEY conducted the Prosecution JOHN EDWARD COCKRELL I am assistant to Messrs Bull and Wilson cloth merchants of St Martin s-lane On Friday 17th Dec about half-past 5 o clock in the afternoon the prisoner came there there were very few other persons in the shop most of them were at their tea—the prisoner spoke to me in an obsequious manner as if he knew me—I had never seen him before—he asked me how I was first and then produced two patterns of cloth and ordered two yards of each of them—he purchased five yards of cloth and a remnant besides I furnished him with them they amounted to about 3l 10s —he tendered a 5l note in payment—I asked him to endorse it with his name and address in full—I brought him a pen and he either wrote or pretended to write on the note—I have no doubt that he wrote the name which is here J Johnson 37 Great Queen-street but I did not take any notice of what was on the back—I saw that the back was written on and here is a name above it—I handed it to our cashier Wipple—I did not notice whether the ink was dry—the cashier gave me some change I gave the prisoner the difference of the note and he went away after saying he should return shortly to purchase some farther articles—I afterwards went to Newgate by the direction of the detective officer to see a man who was in custody for a similar offence it was not the prisoner but Badoski see page 236 —I afterwards went to the Mansion-house I think it was on a Tuesday and after I had been there some time I observed the prisoner enter I followed him at a small distance and stood by him some time alone to assure myself that it was the same man and being perfectly satisfied I procured the assistance of a detective officer and we together stood by him and watched him for an hour or upwards—I observed him noticing me he was casting his eyes in a sidelong direction at myself and the officer without directly gazing at us and he was leaving the Court when I gave him into custody Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did anybody else from your establishment go to the Mansion-house with you A No—it was three or four days after the prisoner came that I went to the Mansion-house I cannot speak positively—I had communicated with our principals about him and gave them a description of him—I do not recollect speaking to other persons about it I will not swear I did not—I had been at the Mansion-house half an hour before I observed the prisoner enter—I went there by the advice of the detective officers as Badoski s case was expected to come on before the Lord Mayor it did not come on while we were present I believe it did afterwards—I went into the body of the Justice-room among the spectators—the prisoner came in at the usual door and put himself at the furthest end of the Court—I went there after him—I was standing near the door when he entered—he did not exactly pass me because I was right at the end of the wall where the door was a few yards further up towards the Judge s seat—the person was at our place a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes when the note was uttered MR CLARKSON Q Did you go more than once to the Mansion-house A No and on that occasion I found the officer Monger—there are counters running up and down our warehouse—I was at one corner—we have two doors exactly opposite each other—I was not nearest to St Martin s-lane but at the back part—there were many pieces of goods between that counter and the back part CHARLES WIPPLE I am the cashier at Bull and Wilson s On Friday 17th Dec the last witness gave me this note—this indorsement on it 17—12—52 is my writing—at the time I wrote it I observed the words J Johnson 37 Great Queen-street upon it which I copied into my book—I could see that it had been written a minute or two but the ink was dry—I gave change to the young man but I do not recollect the exact amount—I was at some considerable distance from where Mr Cockrell was Cross examined Q If the ink was dry how did you distinguish whether it had been written two minutes or an hour A It looks a great deal lighter ANTHONY WILSON MONGER City policeman 564 On 23rd Dec I was at the Mansion House in the course of my duty and saw Cockrell in the body of the Court—a foreigner named Badoski was to be examined for uttering forged notes that day—I saw the prisoner in Court he was at the further end of the Court when I first saw him—Mr Cockrell called my attention to him—he was in my view a little better than an hour I should think—I and Cockrell were standing together some part of the time and the prisoner looked at us several times and got shifting towards the door I was in plain clothes —he kept shifting along a little and at the end of one case which was being heard there was a little bit of a bustle in the Court and he made a rush towards the door—I went up to him caught hold of his arm and said I want you —he said Which station are you going to take me to —I told him I was going to take him to Bow-street police station—we got into a cab by the Mansion-house when we got part of the way up Cheapside I asked him if he knew what he was charged with he said No —I then told him he was charged with uttering a forged 5l Bank of England note at Bull and Wilson s in St Martin s-lane he said Oh I know Bull and Wilson s very well I have had dealings with them —we then went there for the young gentleman to come and press the charge against him—I searched him at the station and found a petition to the Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police in his pocket and asked him what it was he said it was a petition to the Commissioners of Police as he was desirous of getting into the police force and the reason he was at the Mansion House was to see how business was conducted—he afterwards said he went there to get some gentlemen to sign the petition—I found several papers upon him and among others this book produced in which I find the name of Johnson written in two places Cross-examined Q And you find the names of Keys Sears and Gatehouse A Yes I did not tell the Magistrate about the name—when I stopped the prisoner going out of the Court I did not tell him he was charged with uttering a forged Bank of England note before he asked me what station I was going to take him to The witness s deposition being read contained the words I told him he was charged with uttering a forged 5l Bank of England note and he asked me which station I was going to take him to When that was being read over to me by the clerk of the Court I stopped him and said I beg your pardon I did not mention anything about the note until we were half way up Cheapside and he said It is immaterial —I do not know the clerk s name it was at Bow-street—I told the Magistrate that the prisoner said he was at the Mansion House to see how business was conducted as he meant to go into the police and I said I had found several papers in his pocket—I did not tell the clerk I had stated it and that he had not put it down—Pocock told the Magistrate that the prisoner said he went there to get some gentlemen to sign the petition—I did not tell the Magistrate that among the things there was a book with the name of Johnson in it MR CLARKSON Q Had your attention been called to the names in the book when you were before the Magistrate A No I have examined it since THOMAS RICHARDS I am the tenant of the house No 37 Great Queen-street Lincoln s-inn Fields I do not know the prisoner I have never let lodgings to him—I have been the housekeeper two years and do not think he ever lodged there—no person named Johnson or Marks ever lodged in my house THOMAS HONEYMAN I live at No 37 Great Queen-street I Lincoln s-inn Fields and have done so two years—no person named Johnson has lived there since I have been there—I never knew the prisoner to be there—I never saw him before to my knowledge MR WYBIRD I am one of the inspectors of bank notes to the Bank of England—this note is a forgery—it is not Bank paper is very bad paper—the name of Parish appears on it as cashier there is such a cashier at the Bank CHARLES WIPPLE re-examined The note was presented to me in the same state in which it is now with the exception of the date—I wrote down in my book Johnson No 37 Great Queen-street 17—12—52 Cockrell and I made an entry of the number of the note MR PAYNE called the following witnesses for the Defence JOHN SMITH I am a draper and live in Bermondsey-street The prisoner has been in my employment for the last three or four months—I have seen him with a book like that which has been produced in his hand in our shop—I have known him for the last thirteen years—I have some papers here in his writing—I am acquainted with his handwriting— looking at the forged note I do not believe this J Johnson 37 Great Queen-street to be his it is not at all similar—I remember Friday Dec 17—I met the prisoner in Lambeth-walk about 2 o clock that afternoon—I was with him about an hour—he came to me for a shilling which was his usual custom he had 1s every day and we settled the rest of his wages on the Saturday night—he used to sell for me on commission—I did not see him again that day after that not after 3 o clock—I saw him next morning when he came for another shilling Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Are you in trade on your own account or do you carry it on for somebody else A I carry it on for my sister I manage the business for her—I employed the prisoner for my sister—he was in her regular service—the first week s wages he received was 9th Oct and he was in her employ up to 17th Dec —he did not leave then—he remained until he was taken into custody—these papers that I have in my hand are the orders that he brought in and the last is on 22nd Dec —they are the prisoner s writing—he worked for my sister up to 23rd Dec —the last shilling he had was on the Thursday morning I think that was the 23rd Dec —he had been selling goods on commission—he went round to different customers and got orders from them for drapery or he brought them to the shop—we gave him a shilling for each customer—he did not bring any customer on 23rd Dec —I cannot tell whether he brought one on 17th without referring to books—he was in our service on 23rd and had one shilling about 11 o clock in the morning—I did not see him after that time he said he was going into the City and asked me if he could do anything for me it was a wet day—he had earned all the money he wanted to earn that week we could not afford to pay him more than 6s or 8s —I collect for my sister besides selling for her—I get 2l a week—my sister carries on business at 273 Bermondsey-street—she is a widow—she saw the prisoner on 23rd Dec I do not think she is here—a young woman who serves in the shop also saw him she is not here—I was not acquainted with Mr Levitt till I saw him at Bow-street at the last examination—this is my handwriting looking at the deposition —I never saw Mr Levitt till I saw him at Bow-street that was on the Thursday—I live with my sister at 273 Bermondsey-street—I do not lodge in Kennington-lane and never did—I am in the habit of going to Kennington-lane about once a month on a Friday—I go to several houses twenty thirty or forty—I can give you a list of them if you like—I do not know whether Mr Levitt lives in Kennington-lane—I will swear that—I have seen in the deposition that he lives in Cardigan-street Kennington but I have never seen the house MR PAYNE Q How long have you known the prisoner altogether A Thirteen years—his name is William Marks I never heard of his going by the name of Johnson—he has borne a very good character MR CLARKSON Q When did he come out of prison last A I never knew that he was in prison—I have heard that he was in prison in default of bail—I have since heard that it was for beating his mother—I heard that before I came here to give him a character—I do not know how long he was in prison—I have been in prison myself in Horsemonger-lane twenty years ago it was on strong suspicion of debt I was there about a week—I was never in any other prison on my oath never in my life—I have been at a station house—I have been taken into custody MR PAYNE Q You have been asked as to the prisoner s being in prison was that in default of bail for having assaulted his mother A I have heard so since—it was not on any charge of stealing or any dishonesty—I never knew any charge of dishonesty against him—I was never accused of or tried for any charge of dishonesty—I was in prison for debt twenty years ago MR CLARKSON Q Will you swear you were never in a station-house charged with any crime A Yes I have been charged with crime it was for embezzlement—I was never charged with any other crime on my oath—that is about four years ago—that was not when I was commission agent for my sister—on my oath I was never in custody charged with any crime except the occasion on which I was in custody for embezzlement and that was settled and paid MR PAYNE Q How long wereyouin

ox head to pieces that I had bought it was not a prize ox it was one that came from the cattle show—he said My God Uncle what are you going to do with all that —I said Some of it I am going to salt and some I am going to stew to make soup of —he then went to writing at the end of a chest of drawers in my room until it was dusk and he could not see to write any more—I had done what I was going to do with the meat and we sat down and played at cards together the whole of the evening—we played at cribbage—he and I had supper by our two selves—the female part of the family were gone to bed by the female part of the family I mean my wife and my wife s sister—they are here—he and I had some of the head stewed for our supper—I attended before the Magistrate—the prisoner never left my house that evening Cross-examined Q How much before 4 o clock did he come in A It may be ten minutes he was too late for tea—I was then cutting up the ox head—he said Good God uncle what are you going to do with all that —I told him I was going to salt some of it and some of it was to be stewed directly to make soup of—I finished what I was about with the meat and he went to his books as he usually does till it was dusk—I should think he wrote for about three quarters of an hour and then we sat down to cards—I have not got a clock that will go—he went out once to fetch a little porter from a public house about 100 yards away that might be about 10 o clock in the evening—this is my handwriting to this deposition— read— This deponent Joseph Levitt on his oath saith as follows I live at No 3 Cardigan-street Kennington—I am a carpenter—the prisoner is my nephew—on the Monday I believe that this note was offered to be passed he was at home by dusk I will say 5 o clock and he had tea with me when I came home from work—I cannot speak as to any other day that week—the prisoner s name is William Marks I was his godfather and he was named William he has gone by that name ever since —I have never been in custody in my life MR PAYNE Q Just explain in that depositionyouspeak of the Monday on which you believe the note was passed A I was given to understand by the officers that it was on Monday—that was the officer that told me 80 pointing to Pocock —I understood him to say Monday and my evidence before the Magistrate applied to Monday alone—to-day I have been speaking of Friday—I know the prisoner s writing— looking at the note I do not believe the J Johnson on this note to be his writing ANN LEVITT I am the wife of the last witness The prisoner is his nephew—I remember Friday

it is a usual thing for them to play together of an evening when they come home—it was a little before 4 o clock when the prisoner came in—I only judge of the time we had an early dinner and tea together—he had no tea we had our tea—he did not drink tea with my husband I am sure of that that I swear MR PAYNE Q Had you had your tea on the Friday before the prisoner came in A Yes we had dinner

was no ironing going on that evening—the prisoner and Mr Levitt were playing at cards—I cannot say what time we had tea that day but we had it very early—from 4 o clock till I went to bed the prisoner was there with the exception of his going for some porter Cross-examined Q Were you in the house the whole day A yes—the prisoner s mother is my sister—we dined and drank tea together that day as we do in general when we are washing—there was no ironing going on that day COURT Q Who drank tea together that day A Me and my sister Mrs Levitt—Mr Levitt drank tea too we three but not the prisoner I am quite sure of that MR CLARKSON called WILLIAM POCOCK police-sergeant F 14 I went with the other officer to Levitt s house—whilst we were there he asked what day he passed the note and my answer was I did not know for I did not know at that time COURT Q Did the other officer say on what day the note was passed A No I am quite certain of that JURY to CHARLES WIPPLE Q You said that you took the number of the note what was it A 56045 producing his book —we bad not more than five or six 5l notes on that day—I do not know the name of the shopman that gave me the note—I generally account for my cash at 6 o clock—I wrote on the note the name of the person I received it from and here it is Cockrell JOHN EDWARD COCKRELL re-examined I did not hand any other 5l note to Mr Wipple that day GUILTY

Dulwich with Mrs Goulding as her companion she is unwell and very aged she does not usually see persons who call only very intimate friends On Sunday 7th Nov about the middle of the day perhaps 2 o clock the prisoner called and asked me for change for a 10l note—I said I would see if Mrs Goulding could give him change I came back and told him we could not we were very much troubled to get small change up the Hill and it did not suit to give him change—he said he wanted it because he had a new situation in view and he was engaged— I had before that given him money from Mrs Goulding —I did not change the note or send him anywhere to get change—I did not know that he was going to get change—he left and within an hour afterwards returned and said he would pay 2l towards the debt he owed Mrs Goulding which he paid to me Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How near is Mrs Goulding s house to the Half-moon public house A About a quarter of a mile or not so much—I have not known the prisoner long—he is not a relation of Mrs Goulding—I do not know that he calls himself so—Mrs Goulding s Christian name is Elizabeth—she has not also the name of Paulina she has no other name—she is a very old friend of mine—I do not know that the prisoner has been to sea I have heard so—Mrs Goulding knew the prisoner s grandfather who was a relation of hers but we do not consider the prisoner a relation—his grandfather was Mrs Goulding s cousin—the prisoner first came to Mrs Goulding s in the middle of the summer it might be July—he came to ask for money and borrowed some of Mrs Goulding MR CLARKSON Q What age is Mrs Goulding A On the 5th of March she will be ninety she is not bed-ridden but she does not come out at all—I never saw the prisoner before July when he came to ask for a little money for a situation he was going into and I gave him 1l from Mrs Golding—he afterwards called again and had 4l more—when he came on Sunday 7th Nov he said if I would give him change for the note he would pay off 2l of the debt he owed WILLIAM JOHN WEBB I keep the Half-moon at Dulwich On Sunday 7th Nov between 3 and 4 o clock in the afternoon I was in my bar the prisoner came in and asked me if 1 could change a 10l note for Mrs Goulding—I told him I could— Mrs Golding lives near me and is a very charitable lady making gifts on Sundays —I gave the prisoner nine sovereigns and two half sovereigns and he put this note on the counter—I asked him to put his name on the back of it and he wrote this P Goulding on it—he had a glass of ale and a cigar for which he changed one of the half sovereigns and then left—I paid the note into the Excise-office next day Monday and on the following Saturday it was returned to me stamped Forged —the prisoner was dressed quite differently to what he is now he was quite respectable then and wore a black coat waistcoat and cravat—I wrote nothing on the note but can swear that this is the signature he put on it Cross-examined Q You change a good many Bank notes at the Halfmoon A Yes I examined the note more closely after the prisoner left and did not like the appearance of it still I paid it to the Excise—I had not known the prisoner before—this was on a Sunday—people dress differently on a Sunday in my neighbourhood WILLIAM PARTRIDGE I keep the Windmill public house Claphamcommon About the beginning of the second week in Nov between 9 and 12 o clock in the morning a person very like the prisoner but differently dressed came and asked me to change a 5l note—I have no doubt in my own mind that the prisoner is the man—he had the note in his hand I said Who for —he said For Mrs Gassiott over the way —I asked him to put Mrs Gassiott s name on it and got him a pen and ink inside the bar he wrote G Lomax on the note and I gave him five sovereigns I think for it—this is it produced this is the person s writing on the back there was no other writing on it at the time—I kept it till 12th Nov and then paid it to Mr Haddock Messrs Young and Bainbridge s collector and it was returned to me on 16th with Forged printed on it—I was standing behind the bar saw the man coming in and thought it was Mr Gassiott s butler and looked particularly at him because Mr Gassiott s butler wears a white neck handkerchief and the man who came wore a dark one—it was not Mr Gassiott s butler and I have no doubt in my own mind that the prisoner is the man Cross-examined Q How long was he in the place A Five or six minutes he was a long time writing the name MARGARET WRIGHT I keep the house No 21 Sherborne-street Paddington The prisoner lodged with me up to about a fortnight or three weeks of his being taken with a woman who I believe to be his wife and a child—they occupied the front kitchen—I understood from him that he had been a sailor and an omnibus conductor—during the latter part of the time he was in my house he had no occupation—after he left the officer Pitt came and I pointed out to him the prisoner s lodging it was about 12 or 1 o clock in the night—the prisoner was a weekly tenant he gave me no notice of his going away JOHN BAKER I lodge at No 12 Shouldham-street I remember the prisoner coming there on 13th Nov about 11 o clock in the evening—he lodged in my rooms and slept in the same bed with me—he lodged there three nights altogether—he dressed in black—I was present when the police officer came—the room the prisoner lodged in was the top room back ELIZABETH GASSIOTT I am the wife of John Peter Gassiott I never saw the prisoner before and never gave him a 5l note to get changed for me LIBERTY PITT policeman D 181 In consequence of information I obtained I went on Saturday 20th Nov to the Windsor Castle in Churchstreet Edgeware-road about half past 7 o clock in the evening and saw the prisoner in front of the bar—I asked him if his name was not Allen he said it was—I asked him if he would step outside just for a moment—he came out and I asked him if he had not some friends living in the neighbourhood of Camberwell or Dulwich he said he had—I asked him if he had not been there and changed a 10l note—he said he had about two Sundays ago—I told him it was a bad one that I was a policeman and took him into custody for it— I was in plain clothes —I told he must come to the station with me he begged me to let him go—I told him he must come to the station and the inspector could do as he liked I took him there and the inspector desired me to take him to Dulwich—I did so and the landlord identified him directly—I took him back to Camberwell he was locked up till the Monday and then taken before a Magistrate where he made a statement he was then remanded till the Monday afterwards and committed for trial—I searched his lodging at Mrs Wright s No 21 Sherborne-street on Sunday morning 21st Nov about 1 o clock after I returned from Dulwich—I went into the kitchen by the direction of the landlady and found on the dresser a pocketbook and this card with George Gordon Lomax on it produced —when I took him he had on a black coat and trowsers a black satin necktie with long ends and Wellington boots—I afterwards saw him in prison he then had no waistcoat or under coat on only a top coat which was a worse one the black satin tie was gone and he had a red handkerchief—his dress was quite different to what it was when I apprehended him—about the beginning of Dec nearly a fortnight after I apprehended him I searched the other lodging in Shouldham-street I had not found it out before that time—this paletot pair of trowsers boots and shirt were handed to me by Mrs Pradhall the landlady of the beershop as belonging to the prisoner—Mr Baker was present—in the pocket of the coat I found a shirt front and these two copies of the Police Gazette part of one bears date 9th Nov and the other 15th Nov Cross-examined Q You took him at one place and found these things at another A Yes I said to the prisoner Have you been at Dulwich lately —he said Yes two or three Sundays ago —I said Have you any relations there —he said Yes an aunt —I said Did you change a 10l note at the Half-moon —he said Yes —I said it was a bad note and took hold of his arm—he said Let go my arm you will find I am a very different person from what you take me for I said I shall not let go of your arm till you go to the station —as I was riding with him in the cab he said he was heir to 30 000l at Cambridge JOHN BAKER re-examined The prisoner slept with me for some nights—I saw this shirt front produced in his room and asked him if I should get it washed for him as he was from his home—he said no he would take it and get it washed at his laundress s—the coat produced is the one he used to wear—I was present before Mr Elliott when the prisoner made a statement Cross-examined Q How do you know the shirt front and coat A I have looked at them before—I know the front by its being buttoned in this way there are no initials on it—there is no mark on the coat but the lining is torn just by the sleeve—that is not an unusual thing The prisoner s statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows — About three weeks and a half ago I went to see Sir Joseph Douglas who is a friend of mine in Duke-street Adelphi to get a berth on board a steamer to go to China he called at my house previous to that but I was not at home and as I was coming back in the Strand I met a gentleman I thought I knew his face was very much tanned and I thought he had been abroad and that I knew him I ran after him and said Is your name Dyer he said Yes but I have no recollection of you I asked him if ever he had been on board the Hercules at China and he said he had and since then he said he had been captain of the Rajaremri he said What is your name and I said Allen and he shook hands with me and knew me he was chief mate on board the Hercules and I was second mate ten years ago we had several glasses together and got three sheets in the wind and I was with him all that day and the next and he asked me if I was not going out to India again and he said he had come home for his health I told him I had not got money for my outfit and he gave me this 10l note and told me he was going to the North to see his friends he took my address and said when he came back if I wanted 5l or 10l more I could have it WILLIAM WYBIRD I am inspector of notes to the Bank of England I have examined this note it is a forgery in every respect and the paper is bad—this other note is also a forgery and is of the same description as the other and is the same kind of paper MR PAYNE to LIBERTY PITT Q Did Mr Partridge in your presence say he could not identify the prisoner from two other persons who were there A No I did not say That is Allen and Cook the gaoler did not then say I am ashamed of you when I bring a party out to identify him you point him out —he said to the prisoner You have seen my face before —he made no answer and I then said That is Allen MR CLARKSON Q Was that after Mr Partridge had said to the prisoner You have seen my face before A Yes I believe it was Prisoner He was at a loss to identify me you pointed me out and Mr Cook said you ought to be ashamed to do it William Squib tobacconist of No 37 Princes-street Jeremiah Keeble a painter of No 23 Exeter-street Lisson-grove and M Gee Pratt oil and colourman of No 85 Lisson-grove

went to the woman—there were then two at the top and two at the bottom of the counter—the male prisoner then went down to where the woman was and asked me what the best whisky was a quart—I told him and he said he would take a pint—I served him with it and he said Put a pint of the best gin in a bottle —I did so and altogether it amounted to 4s 6d —he tendered me a 5l note which he took out of a small pocket book—I looked at it and not liking the appearance of it I took it to my master in the bar parlour—he said it was a bad one—he came to the counter and asked the male prisoner where he got it from—he said he got it in change of a ten—my master asked him where—he said At an hotel —he was asked what hotel—he said he had been spreeing about and had just come from New York and bad got between 50l and 60l at the hotel—by my master s desire I fetched two policemen who were passing the front door and while I was speaking my master ran out and caught the man just by where I was standing with the policemen—he told the policemen that that was the man that had offered him the note and he was brought into the passage and eventually given into custody—I am positive that the note I received from the prisoner was the one I gave to my master Wilson Q Did I pay you for the quartern of gin and glass of noyeau I had when I came in A Yes I cannot recollect exactly in what coin you paid me I do not know whether it was half a crown but if you gave me any silver I gave you the right change you were three quarters of an hour I should think in the house before you offered me the

had spent all the money and only had this 5l left—I asked him where he came from and he told me New York—I asked him about the hotel—he could not tell what hotel it was or where it was—he said he was out for a spree and spent all the money and that was all he had left—I asked him where he lived—he said anywhere wherever he could—I said it was a bad note—he said If it is a bad note I had it out of change for a 10l note and said to my barman Let me look at the note —I said When you tell me your name and where you got it from then I might let you look —I told the young man in his hearing to fetch a policeman—Wilson said I will see you d—d first or some such expression I will go and fetch one and turned to go out—he went out at the middle door—I went as fast as I could out of the other door took hold of him just as he came on to the pavement and pointed him out to a policeman and poked him into the passage—up to this time I had not seen the female prisoner—the policeman Wilson and myself then went into the coffee room—we searched Wilson but only found a purse and a knife—the female prisoner then came into the coffee room sat down and asked for a cup of coffee—we do not allow females in the coffee room—I ordered her out of the house and she left—I gave Wilson into custody with the note Wilson Q Did not I walk round to meet you when you walked round the bar instead of trying to get away A There are two doors and you took the wrong turning and did not think to meet me—I did not show the note to my mistress she was not down—she did not take another note out of her pocket and compare the two—I did not show it to any woman—I took it to a pawnbroker s with one policeman while the other took care of you in the coffee room—the pawnbroker said it was a bad note and the

SYLVESTER policeman A 441 On 29th Dec between 5 and 6 o clock in the evening Mr Thomas gave Wilson into my charge with this note produced —I know it by the initials and by the name of Thompson and of Davies written on the back—I noticed that at the time—I kept possession of the note and left it with the sergeant on duty—I took Wilson towards the station—the female prisoner followed him caught hold of his arm and said if we locked him up she would be locked up too—Wilson said Get away from me you b—y w—e if it was not for you and your pals persuading me to do this I should not have been in this trouble now —when we were opposite Poplar Church he threw me on my back on the ground and stuck his knees in my throat and his feet in my chest and kicked me several times—he escaped and Martin K 441 who was following behind me pursued and apprehended him at a distance of 300 or 400 yards—we took him to the station and he was locked up—I searched him at the coffee house and found a duplicate of a pair of trowsers on him—next morning I saw the female prisoner at the Thames police court in custody of a constable charged with being drunk—she was discharged and was then taken into custody again Wilson Q When you took me into custody did not you ask me where I had the note from A Yes you told me you had been drinking about on the spree—I asked you if you knew it was a bad one—you said No —you said you had come from New Orleans—I asked you how much money you had when you came home—you did not tell me you had 56l —you did not tell me you landed at Hull—besides the duplicate I found on you a few halfpence and a pocket book—I did not see the mistress of the house come out take a note out of her pocket book and show the difference between the had note and the good one with a sovereign wrapped up in the middle of the good one nor did I say there was a material difference—as we went along I told the other policeman to keep the female prisoner from you—I did not get my hand into your handkerchief and say You b—r I will show you how to fasten your collar —I did put my hand in your handkerchief after you made your escape—I did not say You b—r I will show you how to pass bad money

GEORGE MARTIN policeman K 441 On Wednesday night 29th Dec about 6 o clock I saw Sylvester with Wilson in his custody going in the direction of Poplar station—I followed about live or six yards behind and saw the female prisoner go up and catch hold of Wilson s arm—she whispered something to him which I could not hear and I told her I could not allow her to do that—she followed a short distance behind with me—it was a mile within a very few yards from where I first saw her with Wilson to the station—she followed over three quarters of a mile during which time she went up to the male prisoner again and he shoved her away and said something to her—Sylvester had hold of him at that time—I afterwards saw him look round towards me and the female prisoner who was following behind upon which she dropped her victorine from her neck—I picked it up and she asked me to tie it on for her which I did—she got a few yards further and said her boot lace was untied and asked if I would be kind enough to tie it for her she put her foot up on the railings of Poplar Church I stooped down to tie it but told her she had better tie it herself—as I said that I heard a hallooing noise from the other constable and Wilson and before I could reach them Wilson had escaped—I left the female and ran after him for about ten minutes and overtook him in Kirby-street Poplar over a quarter of a mile from the Church—I had my staff in my hand and he said Don t strike me I will go quietly with you if you had done as I have you would try to get away the same as I have done —Sylvester and Mr Thomey came up at that time—at the station Wilson gave the name of John Williams he was asked where he lived and he said Anywhere —on the following morning he was taken to the Thames police court and while I was there with him I saw the female prisoner there in custody on a charge of being drunk I told Mr Thomey and he gave her in charge for this transaction—I told her she was charged with being concerned with a man in uttering a forged 5l note she said What me I have no notes about me I was out all day drinking yesterday —she asked if she might be allowed to see the man she was charged with I told her she would after she was searched—I did not search her—there was nothing found on her relating to this charge—I took her into the waiting room where the male prisoner was with a constable she said she had never seen him before Wilson Q What time did you take the female prisoner into custody A It might be 11 o clock or more she was not drunk—it was a few minutes past 6 o clock when I took you—I did not strike you on the side of the head or anywhere COURT Q Was Thompson at all intoxicated when she was walking along the night before A She had been drinking REBECCA HOULTON I live at No 147 Royal Mint-street and let lodgings—I know both the prisoners Thompson has lodged with me about a twelvemonth last May and Wilson six or seven weeks but I never knew his name we always used to call him Mr Navvy—Thompson had apartments to herself Wilson Q Was it a month I was in your house A I cannot say how many weeks it was but I think you came some time in Nov —I know that you were drinking the next week and I knew you to have a good bit of money—you paid me every night before you went to bed—you were extremely drunk one night and I took care of your pocket book—you asked me for the money the next morning—I went out with you and got half a sovereign and two half crowns which Mrs Keeley had—you were drinking the next day and the morning after that you asked me for some money and I told you to take a sovereign out of the book but I do not know what you took—I asked you how you were getting through your money so fast—I gave the book into your possession before Christmas—I think you had some drink before you left my house on the morning in question—I did not see you bring a bottle of drink into my kitchen—you had something in a jug on Christmas-eve—you slept in a four bedded room there were four men in the room MR CLARKSON Q In what name did the prisoner come to you A He never told me his name you cannot tell people s names when they come and ask for a night s lodging—he had a bed to himself and there were three other beds in the room—that was the case all the time he was at my house I never knew anything to the contrary WILLIAM LATIMER I live at No 1 Royal Mint-street I knew the male prisoner by the name of John Clark but Mr Navvy was the name he was occasionally called by—that is an abbreviation of the word navigator an excavator Wilson Q Did I ever tell you my name A Yes I told you I did not know what name to address you by and you said your name was John Clark—I heard you called by the name of John occasionally PHILIP CRELIN I am out-fitter of No 128 St George s-street St George s in the East On 8th Sept between 7 and 8 o clock in the evening a man came to my shop—I am not able to say whether Wilson is the man—I am short sighted—I sold him one dozen shirts for 335 —he gave me a piece of paper purporting to be a 5l note I gave him change took the note into the counting-house and laid it on the table—after he was gone I went to fold it up and thought the paper did not feel exactly like what I had been accustomed to and I put it by very carefully—this is it produced —I know it because I wrote my name and address on it and then took it to the Bank of England—I received it back stamped as it is now—this blue writing was on it when I took it Wilson I never saw the man in my life FLETCHER PAPE I am foreman to the last witness On 8th Sept a person whom I believe to be the prisoner came and asked to look at some shirts—I saw him lay something down on the counter which bad the appearance of a 5l note but I was on the opposite side of the shop—six weeks or two months afterwards I went to Newgate for the purpose of recognizing the man who passed the note—I saw ten prisoners brought out into the yard and I recognized the last one in the file as they were marched round the yard—it was the male prisoner Wilson I never saw the man and never had a dozen shirts in my possession Witness It may have been about four months afterwards that I saw the prisoner in Newgate it is about a fortnight since WILLIAM WYBURG I am one of the inspectors of notes to the Bank of England This note first produced is a forgery in all respects paper and print and it wants the water mark—this other note is also forged it is not Bank paper and there is no water mark only the imitation of one—they are both from the same plate COURT Q But one note is headed London 1852 and the other is Leicester June 21 1852 A The Leicester is placed lower down than the London but the copperplate engraving is the same if you place the two notes together you will see that all the engraving comes on the same line and there is space enough for London Leicester or Manchester to be put before—a note at the Bank of England is made from one plate and London Leicester or whatever place it is is put in in the type afterwards Wilson s Defence My master went to Australia and I went across to New York and went into Mr Burns s office he gave me 10l in notes and the remainder in gold and silver amounting to 56l I came over here and landed in Hull on 28th Oct I went spreeing and drinking about I came up to London and met a policeman on Tower-hill who directed me to Mrs Houlton

MESSRS BALLANTINE PARRY and HOLL conducted the Prosecution HERMAN CHRISTIAN TURCK I am a member of the firm of Collman and Stolterfoht foreign bankers carrying on business in London and Liverpool I know Mr Pries—I have known him between six and seven years—he carried on business as a commercial agent—he was not a speculator in corn that I was aware of—I was in the habit of making advance of money to him to a very considerable amount lately during the last year—I have at times advanced him above 50 000l —I have not got in my possession an accountable receipt for corn on 23rd Oct it was here produced —I know this document—I received it from Mr Pries—it is dated 23rd Oct 1852—I advanced him money upon that—he owed us largely at that time—he deposited this with me either the day it bears date or the day after—it is signed Brown and Young read — By order of R F Pries we have this day transferred into the name of Messrs Collman and Stolterfoht 759 quarters and four bushels of wheat and other quantities by various ships entered by R F Pries and now lying at our granaries Bermondsey-wall The wheat is insured against risk of fire by us Corn Exchange 23rd Oct 1852 Brown and Young THOMAS YOUNG I am one of the firm of Brown and Young—we warehouse corn—we call ourselves lightermen warfingers and granary-keepers The signature to this document is neither that of myself or my partner or signed by our authority—my partner is here—goods are warehoused at our granaries by persons having the legal title to them in this country on their arrival—if after goods have been warehoused they are sold and require to be transferred a similar document to this is issued if it is required COURT Q If sold you would give a similar document by the order of the persons that lodged the goods with you to the vendee A Yes MR BALLANTINE Q According to your custom do you or not hold yourself responsible for goods that are represented by that document A Certainly COURT Q TO whose order would you deliver the goods which would be delivered upon that document if it was genuine A To the order of Collman and Stolterfoht Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q Sometimes I understand you do not give a document of this description at all A Never unless it is required MR BALLANTINE Q Do you give a document of that kind when it is required A Whenever it is required not otherwise—in the event of it being required the corn remains ready for delivery to the parties to whose name it is transferred—we do not give any other document than this when we are requested to give any not when we give a transfer of this kind it is one similar to this—it may not be in the same words MR HUDDLESTON submitted that this document was not an accountable receipt within the statute it must first of all be a receipt this was a document evidencing the possession or transfer of goods but not a receipt it merely amounted to an assertion on the part of Brown and Young that upon a certain day they admitted the transfer of property from A to B and whether the document were given or not the warehouseman would equally be answerable to the real owner in support of this view he cited Harvey s case Russell and Ryan 227 Clark and Newsam 16 Law Journal Exchequer Reports 296 Reg v West and Clark v Chaplin Exchequer Reports 26 were also referred to MR BARON ALDERSON was clearly of opinion that the document in question was an accountable receipt it implied in substance that the goods had been received by Brown and Young from Pries for the benefit of Collman and Stolterfoht and would be delivered to them or their order if that were so it was surely a receipt of goods on the part of Brown and Young which they would account for to Collman and Stolterfoht or their order it implied that they had received the goods and that they would be accountable to them for them it was true the word receipt was not named but it was of necessity so implied that no one could see the one without implying the other MR BARON MARTIN entirely concurred JOHN DEWDIN BROWN I am in partnership with Mr Young The signature to this document is cetainly not mine nor authorised by me in any way COURT Q Were there in your possession goods of that sort of Mr Pries at the time A I should think very likely not I do not attend to the granary department my partner attends more to that than myself MR YOUNG re-examined There were no goods of the kind in our possession HERMAN CHRISTIAN TURCK re-examined by MR PARRY At the time I received this document from Mr Pries I knew there was such a firm as Brown and Young Q I believe though you did not actually advance money upon that document yet having it in your possession you afterwards continued your advances to Mr Pries A I did COURT Q On the faith of that document A Yes MR PARRY Q Do you know the handwriting of the body of that document A It is the prisoner s the whole of it except the signature that I cannot speak to COURT Q Is it all written or partly printed A It is all written MR PARRY Q Do you remember about 30th Dec Mr Pries coming to you A Yes and it was agreed that we should give up this document on his repaying us our advances at that time he was indebted to us about 50 000l —I gave him this document back—he said he wanted it to get an advance of money from other parties—I gave it him and endorsed it—here is my endorsement across it—it is Retransfer the within to Mr Robert F Pries that was my order of retransfer to him when he stated that he wanted it for the purpose of raising money—his signature is now underneath it it was not there when I gave it him back Cross-examined Q I think after that 31st Dec when you re-transferred that document he paid you as much as 20 000l A Yes upon this retransfer and another—that left a very large balance still due to us about 50 000l —he reduced it from 70 000l to 50 000l MR BALLANTINE Q When did he reduce it A I delivered this document on 31st Dec and on 1st Jan he paid 10 000l and on the 4th 10 000l more—I parted with another document at the same time—that leaves a balance due to us of about 50 000l EMILE ADOLPHE HERMAN I manage the business of Mr Holford I received this document on 1st Jan from the prisoner—I knew the firm of Collman and Stolterfoht and seeing their name to it I did not hesitate for a moment to take it there was also another ware housekeeper s receipt—I advanced 18 000l on the two JOSEPH HUGGETT City policeman On 8th Jan I received information that the prisoner had absconded in consequence of that information and inquiries I made I went to the station of the North Western Railway Company Euston-square about a quarter to 9 o clock in the evening—the 9 o clock mail train to York and Newcastle was about starting—I was accompanied by a gentleman from the house of Messrs Monto and Co who was acquainted with the person of the prisoner—I found the prisoner in a first class carriage he had got a shawl round his neck his coat buttoned up and a skull cap on I took him into custody—he had 101 sovereigns and 11s 9d upon him—I told him I was an officer and I must trouble him to go back to the City with me—I did not mention the charge—he said nothing whatever to me—he had a carpet bag which was full of new clothes and he had also on him a railway ticket to Newcastle-upon-Tyne MR HUDDLESTON to MR YOUNG Q Would you have given a document of this description signed Brown and Young if you had not had goods in your possession A Certainly not it makes all the difference whether we had goods or not in our possession MR BALLANTINE Q You would not have given a document of that description unless you had the corn in your warehouse A No GUILTY Aged 31 — Transported for Life There were other indictments against the prisoner 
t18530404-504  504 HARRIET BROWN and SARAH WELLFARE were indicted for feloniously uttering a forged 10l Bank of England note with intent to defraud in other COUNTS Brown was charged as an accessory after the fact MESSRS CLARKSON and BAYLEY conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM LAURIE I am an assistant to Messrs Sewell and Cross drapers in Old Compton-street Soho On 12th Feb the prisoner Wellfare came into our shop about a quarter or half past 3 o clock in the afternoon—she purchased a few articles amounting to 1l 10s 7 1/2 d —I made out a bill of parcels and a duplicate of it—this is the duplicate which I made out looking at it —I retained it she gave me a 10l Bank of England note in payment—I gave it to the cashier Clewet and he gave me a check for 5l and gold and silver in exchange—this check produced I believe to be the one he gave me—I gave the same check that I received from Clewet to Wellfare—another of the assistants named Stocks was near me when the purchase was made—I heard him offer to send the parcel and I heard her say No thank you I ll take it myself and I think she said that she lived close at hand in King-street—something was said in reference to living in King-street—I heard the words King-street —she then went away and took the parcel with her Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Then this remark about King-street was not addressed to you was it A It was to Mr Stocks there is a King-street I believe somewhere in the neighbourhood of Old Compton-street—I think the woman was in the shop about half an hour I cannot say exactly—I did not have a good deal of conversation with her—we did not converse upon other topics besides business I am quite sure of that—among the articles she purchased was a black cloth mantle some stockings and some corded skirts—I believe the mantle was for herself—she did not look at a great many things before she bought—I will not state any particular time that she was in the shop—our customers are principally ladies—I cannot recollect whether I showed her gowns and other things—I think I showed her nothing else except what she wanted MR CLARKSON Q Should you know the mantle again if you were to see it A Yes I think I should— a mantle was here produced this is it ALFRED SMITH I am an assistant to Messrs Sewell and Cross I know a lady named Lowe by serving her—I received a check from her and I have no doubt that this is it—the date corresponds—it was on 12th Feb that I received it and about 1 o clock in the day—it is drawn on Cox and Biddulph for 5l —after receiving it from Mrs Lowe I took it to the cashier Clewet to get it changed—at the time I received it from Mrs Lowe this endorsement of the name of Proctor was not upon it—Mrs Lowe wrote the check in my presence—there was no writing on the back of it then Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Are you quite positive that that is the same check A I would not swear to the paper but from the circumstance of its bearing the same date and knowing that Mrs Lowe was only there once that day and also knowing that she had an account there and that she never pays checks except she buys goods for a friend I have every reason to believe it is the same CHARLES CLEWET I am cashier at the house of Sewell and Cross On 12th Feb I remember receiving a check for 5l from Mr Smith—I did not notice the name of the drawer—I put it in the till—in the course of the same day I received from Laurie a 10l Bank note—I gave him for it this check for 5l and the rest in gold and silver—I put the note in the till—that was between 3 and 4 o clock—it is the practice of our house that I should account to one of the partners for the cash I receive during the day after 5 o clock—I accounted to Mr Bacon one of the firm for the cash I received that day—I gave to him the same 10l note that Laurie had given to me Cross-examined Q Are you the principal cashier in this establishment A I am the only cashier I am quite unable to swear to this note—I am sure that the note I received I handed to Mr Bacon COURT Q Had you more than one 10l Bank of England note to give to Mr Bacon that day A No WILLIAM BACON I am a partner in the house of Sewell and Cross I remember Clewet the cashier accounting to me on 12th Feb somewhere about 5 o clock in the afternoon—among other moneys he handed me a 10l note—this is it—I recognise it by the endorsement that is upon it—it is dated 12th April 1852 and is numbered 65059 Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Do you positively swear to that note A I do by the endorsement—I recollect it and it is the only note I had at that time—I sent it to our bankers WILLIAM STOCKS I am an assistant to Sewell and Cross I recollect the prisoner Wellfare coming to our shop on 12th Feb last between 3 and half past 3 o clock in the afternoon—she purchased some goods—I saw her give Laurie a 10l note and saw him go to the cashier and return—he gave the prisoner the check and some gold—I did not notice the check further than seeing him give it her—I cannot say that this is the check I did not notice it—I asked Wellfare if we should send the parcel home for her—she said No thank you I only live in King-street —on 3rd March I went in company with a policeman in search of Wellfare—we went to Porter-street Coventry-street or Cranbourne street—it was about 7 o clock or half past in the evening when I went there—I waited for about two hours—I then saw Wellfare coming down the opposite side of the street where I was standing—I was at the corner of Porter-street—she was in company with a young man—I walked past her to see if I could recognize her as the same person that I had seen—I saw that it was and told the policeman—he and I then walked up to her—before we went up to her she turned back as soon as she saw me—she saw me watching her and threw her veil over her face—we told her that we wanted her to go with us and we took her to Bow-street—I did not hear the constable say anything to her—she wanted to know what we wanted her for—I did not hear her say anything till we got to Bow-street—she was there charged with passing a 10l note—she said Not to my knowledge I did not —she afterwards said she recollected passing a 10l note but she was not aware it was bad—she said that a friend of hers gave it to her of the name of Johnson whom she had been in the habit of meeting at a night house—the inspector asked her what she did with the check that was given her and she said Was it the piece of paper with a picture on it —the inspector said that it was—she said that she gave it to this Mr Johnson one morning when he came up to her she was in bed at the time—she did not say what morning—I was at the police office when she was remanded—I do not recollect the date—I saw her look at the other prisoner and say I never saw that woman before Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Were you by all the time that she was in the shop A No not quite all the time—she was not there so long as an hour—I should think it was about half an hour—I did not show her anything—I did not see any one do so besides Laurie BARNABAS ALDERMAN policeman F 123 On Thursday evening 3rd March I was in company with Stocks in Porter-street Leicester-square—a little before 9 o clock I saw the prisoner Wellfare and a young man of the name of Garcia—we followed them into Rider s-court Leicester-square to the bottom of the court—they there stood and looked into a bonnet shop in Cranbourne-street at the corner of Rider s-court—Mr Stocks went out of the court into Cranbourne-street to the window where they were standing and went by the side of Garcia—I saw Wellfare look under the man Garcia and she said something to him and she then turned up the court and pulled her veil down—they passed roe and I stopped them—I said to Wellfare I want you —she said What for —I said For uttering a forged 10l Bank of England note at Messrs Sewell and Co s 44 Compton-street Soho the said Me —I said Yes you —she said Me again—I said Yes —she said Not to my knowledge —I said You must go with me to the station house —we went down the street—she said Do you think it is a bad one —I said Yes I think it is a very bad one by the look of it —she said I know I passed one but I was not aware it was a had one —on the road to the station she asked me several times if I thought it was a bad one and I repeated to the same effect that I believed it was a very bad one—she was searched at the station and 8s 4d was found upon her—she was asked where she got the note from—she said a friend of hers at Birmingham had sent it to her—she said she had known him for the last two years and she saw him the night that she received the 10l note—she said that she had slept with him two or three nights—she gave her name Sarah Wellfare and her address No 20 Porter-street Leicester-square—I handed her over to Mackenzie the inspector— MR CLARKSON proposed to ask the witness what he knew of the person in whose company she was with a new to show his connection with certain matters at Birmingham but MR JUSTICE ERLE was of opinion that unless it could be proved that the prisoner knew of that connection the evidence was not admissable it was not pursued —I afterwards went that same evening to search her lodgings—among other things which I found were these two letters in these envelopes producing them —I found them in a chest of drawers in the front room first floor at No 20 Porter-street—the house belongs to a lady in Frith street—Miss Catherine Chance is a lodger on the ground floor—I also found in the same drawer this bill of parcels and twenty-eight duplicates one in the name of Harding—I was at the police court after the apprehension of Wellfare when the two women were placed together—I heard Wellfare say that she did not know Brown that she had never seen her before Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Was Stocks with you whilst all this conversation was going on A Yes I cannot say whether he heard all that took place at the station house—I was obliged to be out in the yard and I left him in the station—I did not hear her say that a friend of hers named Johnson gave her the note whom she was in the habit of meeting at a night house—very little was said before we got to the station—I dare say Mr Stocks might have heard her say that she got it from Johnson and the greater part of the conversation in fact more than I did—I believe the house where she was lodging is not principally occupied by young women—I found a letter there beginning Dear Sarah —at the time I said the note was a very bad one it was stamped Forged as it is now but I should have known it had been a bad one if it had not been stamped—I should have known it directly EDWARD CROCKER I am cashier to Messrs Johnson and Matthie of Hatton-garden gold and silver refiners On 14th Feb the prisoner Brown came to my shop—it was about the middle of the day I do not recollect precisely—she asked for one ounce and a half of gold—it was served her—she paid for it—she gave me a 5l check and two sovereigns—I believe this check produced to be the same—I asked her what name—she said Proctor the name and address written at the back of the check —I believe she said the address but that I will not be positive of—she said Proctor and I believe also stated the address but J am positive she said Proctor the name and address at the back of the check —I believe when she said Proctor she also said 6 Charles-street City-road —I referred to the back of the check and saw P Proctor written 6 Charles-street City-road —I paid her the difference and she went away—the check was afterwards paid into our bankers Messrs Williams and was duly honoured—I believe she had on a black bonnet and a mantle—it was a dark mantle I could not tell the material—I do not think I should know it again Cross-examined by MR BIRNIE Q You asked her no further questions A No I did not ask how she came by the check—she gave the name Proctor quite readily as any other customer would PETER PROCTOR I live at No 6 Charles-street City-road and am a goldbeater—the endorsement on this check Proctor 6 Charles-street City-road is not my writing it was not written by my authority—I know nothing whatever of it—I know nothing whatever of either of the two prisoners they are perfect strangers to me MR PARRY to WILLIAM STOCKS Q Something was mentioned about Mr Johnson do you remember whether the girl told you that the man went by the name of Harry Johnson at Jessop s wine-rooms that it was a nickname he went by A I do not recollect that she said that a Mr Johnson gave it to her a friend of hers whom she met at a night house—I do not recollect anything further than that—I heard her say that Johnson sent it to her from Birmingham—I cannot say that I heard all that the policeman did I heard part of what she said—I have heard him give his evidence to-day—I did not hear anything that she said to him in going to the station—what I heard was at the station—I heard Jessop s wine-rooms mentioned—I do not recollect who mentioned them—I did not hear anything about the nickname of Harry Johnson JURY Q Was it the check or the note that she said she received from Johnson A The note she received from Johnson and the check she afterwards gave to him CATHERINE CHANCE I live on the ground-floor at No 20 Porter-street Leicester-square and have done so for ten years In the month of Oct last the prisoner Wellfare came to reside in the front room on the first floor—she lived there until she was taken into custody—I know Brown by sight she came to live there about six weeks before her apprehension—she occupied the same room with Well fare Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Were you examined before the Magistrate A No I am still living at the house—I have no doubt about this matter DANIEL KIRTON I have seen the two prisoners together at No 20 Porter-street WILLIAM SMITH I am a tailor living at No 11A Berners-street Oxford-street I know the prisoner Sarah Well fare—I had a relative of the name of Tapley—I knew Wellfare living with Tapley—Tapley had an uncle named Harding—I remember after Tapley left her her going to live in Porter-street—on Wednesday 23rd Feb this letter produced was brought to my house by the postman—the postage was not paid and 1 refused to take it in—it is addressed to Miss Harding at Mr Smith s tailor 11 Berners-street —it was brought again the next day the 24th—I then took it in—on the following night the 25th Wellfare came to my house—she asked if I had received a letter from Harriet Brown—I said I did not know who the woman was that it was sent from but there was a letter for her and I produced the letter and put it down on the counter—she took it up opened it in my pre-sence and I suppose read it—she looked at it and put it down and made some observation—the policeman John Baker had been to my house that night to make some inquiry about a letter—I told Wellfare of that—I after-wards gave the letter to the policeman Baker— Baker here produced the letter —I gave it to him directly he asked for it— MR CLARKSON proposing to read this letter MR BIRNIE objected there being no proof that it was written by Brown MR JUSTICE ERLE would not receive it as evidence against Brown but in the nature of a conversation addressed to Wellfare MR PARRY submitted that it could not be receivable on that ground but upon looking at the letter did not press the objection and MR CLARKSON withdrew the evidence The following documents were here read —The endorsement on the note J M Glover 16 New-street Walter s Hotel the bill of parcels dated 12th Feb containing several articles arhong others a mantle and amounting in the whole to 1l 10s 7 1/2 d the duplicate of the bill of parcels the 5l check dated 12th Feb 1853 drawn by Georgiana Lowe and endorsed P Proctor 6 Charles-street City-road and the two following letters found in Wellfare s room the envelope was addressed to Mrs Wellfare 20 Porter-street Leicester-square London and bore the Birmingham postmark of 9th Feb and the London postmark of 10th Feb — Birmingham Wednesday My dear dear Sally —I beg you ten thousand pardons for the shabby way I left you but the fact is my love I lost all my money at play the last night you saw me and was obliged to borrow 1l to take me home I felt ashamed to come and tell you particularly as I knew you were a little distressed for money but however my darling I have made amends I hope by sending you the half of a 10l note Let me know by return that you have received it and I will send the other Mind and pay your rent and get your things out with it and be a good girl till the 27th when you will be again troubled with your sincere and affectionate friend J M GLOVER —the other letter was addressed in the same way bearing the postmark of 11th Feb —11th Feb 1853 Walter s Hotel New-street My dear clear Sally —I have just returned from Rugby and am very angry at your not sending me a letter How am I to know whether you have received the first half Even if you could not write some friend would have done it for you but I cannot be angry with my pet so I have sent you the other half I have written my address upon it If it should be lost the fault is not mine and on my word I will not send you any more for two months Be sure and pay your rent and get your things out of pledge with it and be sure to keep a good girl until I come up at the end of the month I must now conclude to save the post and with kind love my dear Sally remain your affectionate friend J M GLOVER P S I will send you a Valentine next week — One of the duplicates produced was also read it was for a shirt pledged on 30th July 1852 at Mr Walters s Mount-street Lambeth in the name of Ann Harding Allen BARNABAS ALDERMAN re-examined Among the duplicates I found in the drawer in Welfare s room there was one in the name of Johnson and another in the name of Harriet Brown—these are them These being read were both in the name of A Johnson MR CLARKSON now proposed to prove a subsequent uttering of another forged 10l note by Brown MR PARRY submitted that there was no precedent for such a course and that it could not touch the question at issue which was the mind with which they uttered the note on 12th Feb MR JUSTICE ERLE referred to the case of Reg v Skennett and another 2 Car and Payne for joint uttering of counterfeit coin as the nearest in point MR PARRY contended that there was no such evidence of joint uttering in this case this was entirely different from a case of slander or libel where what is said after publication might be received to show the mind with which it was published here it was sought by proving a subsequent uttering by one prisoner to prove the mind of the other prisoner at the first uttering for it was only upon that principle that the evidence could be admissible MR JUSTICE ERLE was of opinion that it was receivable to show co-operation for a common purpose that was the cote suggested by the prosecution If that were made out the act of each vat the act of both and upon that principle the first uttering would be the act of Brown the second that of Wellfare Taking the different items of evidence proved—the living together their denial of each other the disposal of the check &c coupled with the fact about to be proved that both notes came from the same plate there was reasonable evidence of co-operation to go to the Jury at the same time he cautioned the Jury that unless they were of opinion that both the prisoners co-operated in the uttering on the 12th the forthcoming evidence was not to be taken into their consideration as against Brown WILLIAM SAMUEL MARSHALL I live at No 20 in the Strand and carry on a grocery business there On 19th Feb at 3 o clock in the afternoon the prisoner Brown came to my shop—I have a shopman named Scott—I heard the amount of what she called for but did not take notice of each item—the amount wat 6s 11d —she tendered in payment what purported to he a 10l note—this produced is the note I marked it at the time Scott handed it to me—I did not lose sight of it from the time it was produced by Brown until I marked it—I looked at it und in consequence of the opinion which I formed of it I told the prisoner it was a forgery and sent for a constable—she handed me two letters and said that was how she had received it—these are the letters read both addressed to Miss H Brown 41 Bedfordbury Covent-garden London 17th Feb My dear Harriett —I am at present fortunately in a position to help you out of your present difficulty but really have so many calls now upon my purse that if I do not economise I shall be rained I enclose you half of a 10l note and will send you the other as soon as you acknowledge the receipt of this Do not expect any more from me before April I have put my address on it and with the hope you will turn steady believe me yours affectionately THOMAS MORGAN Walter s Hotel New-street Birmingham — Birmingham 18th Feb My dear Harriet —I am unexpectedly called into the north and leave here to-night consequently I cannot wait for your answer but have enclosed the other half of the note for you which I hope will arrive safe Pray keep your resolution of getting into service again anything is better than the life you have been leading lately Let me only see you steady and I will do all I can to assist you but not otherwise I shall not be in London or here before April so do not write to me until you hear from me again and until then believe me yours affec tionately THOMAS MORGAN Walter s Hotel New-street Witness She said she had been in distress and met a gentleman that she bad known three years before in St Martin s-lane and he gave her a sovereign and told her he would do more for her when he could and that he took her into a public house and gave her some brandy and water—she said she had received the 10l note from him from Birmingham that was the next thing she heard—she received the one half of the note in the first letter and the other half in the other—she also stated that she had answered one of the letters—she was taken to Bow-street on the same day and she there produced these two notes and the envelopes Cross-examined by MR BURNIE Q Had you ever seen Brown before A Not to my knowledge—I believe she had not been a customer at my shop—she produced these letters at once—when I turned to her to tell her it was a forgery she had the letters in her hand ready to produce—the envelopes were in the same state as they are now with the postmarks—I looked at the note two or three minutes before I told her it was a forgery and also spoke to a gentleman in the shop and asked his opinion about it and when I went to tell her it was a forgery she had the letters all ready in her hand WILLIAM WYBIRD I am one of the inspectors of Bank notes in the Bank of England—it is never the practice of the Bank to issue more than one note of the same amount and date—this note uttered on 12th Feb is No 65059 dated 12th April 1852 and purports to be signed by a cashier named T Parish—it is a forgery in every respect—this other note uttered on 19th Feb is also a forgery in every particular—it purports to be signed by T Parish—it is also dated 12th April 1852 and No 65059 the same as the other—both are for 10l —they are fac-similes—I have no doubt they are from the same plate—one of them is endorsed J M Glover 16 New-street Walters Hotel and the other Thomas Morgan Walters Hotel New-street BROWN— GUILTY Aged 22 WELLFARE— GUILTY Aged 22

CHAPMAN ESQ I am a partner in the house of Messrs Gurney Overend and Co money dealers in the City On 14th April last I received this letter by the post containing these two bills read MESSRS Gurney Overend and Co Bradford Yorkshire April 13 1853 Gentlemen —Having to meet some rather heavy cash payments on Friday next for wool purchases in the neighbourhood of Liverpool I have taken the liberty of enclosing two bills of Exchange one upon Messrs Armitage Brothers for 474l 18s and the other on Messrs James Acroyd and Sons for 388l 10s 9d I need scarcely say your kindly remitting me the cash for the same to the Stork Hotel Liverpool will be deemed by me a great favour and I am com pelled to beg of you so to do by Thursday s post having to pay the same on Friday morning I feel that I am requesting a great favour at your hands but in excuse I can only urge the difference of discount charged here and in London Signed John Adamson and Sons — The bills were both at two months purporting to be drawn and endorsed by John Adamson and Sons and accepted by the parties stated in the letter —I know a firm of Adamson and Sons they are in the wool trade at Bradford—I am not aware that we had ever done business for them but I happened to know them because they are the agents of Mr Joseph Pease who everybody knows and who is a great friend of myself and Mr Gurney—when I received these bills I paused I did not like them—I wrote a letter as desired directed to Mr Adamson at the Stork Hotel Liverpool and also sent a letter to Messrs Harris bankers at Bradford—that was for the purpose of ascertaining whether the bills were genuine or not—this produced is the letter I sent to the Stork Hotel EDWARD ADAMSON I am one of the firm of John Adamson and Sons We carry on business in the wool trade at Bradford—there is no other firm there of that name—no part of this letter or of these bills is in my handwriting nor in the handwriting of any of our firm or of any person in our establish-ment—neither the drawing or endorsement of these bills is the writing of any of our firm—we had no occasion to draw upon these acceptors—both the transactions were quite unknown to us— looking at two other letters neither of these are written by any person connected with our firm Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q How may partners are there in your firm A My father myself and a younger brother—my father s name is John—both my father and brother take an active part in the business—neither of them are here—I never had any transaction with the prisoner—I know nothing whatever of him—I have never seen him in company with my father or brother HENRY ACROYD I am a partner in the firm of James Acroyd and Sons manufacturers and merchants at Halifax The acceptance of James Acroyd and Sons to this bill is not mine nor is it the handwriting of any of our firm or of any person connected with our establishment—I do not recollect ever having had a single transaction with Messrs Adamson—I am not aware of any other firm of our name at Halifax Cross-examined Q How many partners are there in your firm A Two myself and brother—my father is not living—I know nothing at all of the prisoner GEORGE ARMITAGE I am a merchant carrying on business at Hudders field I have three partners—the firm is Armitage Brothers —the accept ance to this bill is not mine or either of my brothers nor is it the writing of any person connected with our establishment—there is no firm of our name at Huddersfield besides ours—we have no account with Messrs Adamson Cross-examined Q You know nothing of the prisoner I believe A Nothing whatever HENRY THOMAS HITCHINS I am acquainted with the prisoner—I have seen him write often—I am well acquainted with his handwriting—these two bills are his handwriting the whole of them—I believe the acceptances are his writing as well as the rest and the endorsements also—I say the same of this letter and also of these two other letters COURT Q Where does be live A I do not know—I knew him in London Cross-examined Q Where do you reside A I am at present at Hake s Hotel Duke-street Manchester-square—the prisoner is related to me by marriage—I have had quarrels with him—I have never expressed a determi nation to get him out of the country if I could—these bills are in the ordinary handwriting of the prisoner without the slightest disguise and the letter also—I assisted the prisoner in endeavouring to procure him an appointment abroad but I have not in any other way tried to get him out of the country—I have not since I heard of this matter said that this was a good opportunity of getting him out of the country—I swear that Q Did you go to Messrs Gurney to see these bills A I went to Messrs Gurney to ask if they could do anything in letting him off—I saw the bills there—I did not go there for the purpose of seeing them—I after-wards saw a woman who calls herself the prisoner s wife—I am not aware that she is his wife—I have not the least knowledge that she is his wife—I should not call her a gentlewoman—I never told her that I had seen the bills and that they were not in the prisoner s handwriting—I deny it on my oath—I never told her anything of the kind MR OVEREND Q For what purpose did you go to Messrs Gurney A To see if there was any opportunity of getting this man relieved from the horrid charge against him GEORGE FREDERICK GOODMAN I live at Grove-terrace Chiswick I know the prisoner and am acquainted with his handwriting— looking at the docu ments produced I believe this letter to be his writing the second letter like-wise also the memorandum the drawer s name and the endorsement and the same with the second bill COURT Q Do you mean you believe this Bradford Yorkshire to be his handwriting A No I do not—I cannot say that the body of the bill is his—I do not think it is—I cannot speak to the body of either bill—I have no doubt whatever as to this letter nor of these other letters Cross-examined Q Have you ever seen this gentleman write more than once A No T have not and then only to sign his name but I have since received a letter from him—it was in Dec 1851 that I saw him write—I know Captain Hitchins—he did not find me out to give evidence of this handwriting—I believe it was Sergeant Whicher—I saw him here this morning—I have seen Captain Hitchins a dozen or perhaps twenty times but only upon matters of business—Whicher did not come to me with a message from him—Captain Hitchins has not asked me to come here and prove this matter not in any way MR OVEREND Q When was it you received a letter from the prisoner A Referring to it It is dated Aster House New York 5 Jan 1852 —I am able from that to speak with confidence as to the handwriting COURT Q Did you afterwards communicate personally with the prisoner as to the contents of that letter A No MR OVEREND Q Did you do anything in pursuance of that letter A Yes I have had no opportunity of communicating with the prisoner since about what I did MR BARON ALDERSON did not think under these circum stances the witness could refer to the letter EDWARD COULSTON THOMAS I keep the Stork Hotel at Liverpool On 15th April I received this letter read To Mr Thomas Stork Hotel Liver-pool 14th April 1853 Sir —Having been unexpectedly obliged to alter my usual journey I find I cannot be in Liverpool as I had appointed Should therefore any letters arrive at your house which I am in full expec-tation of addressed either to J Adamson or J Adamson and Sons I shall esteem it a very great favour your causing the same to be immediately trans-mitted by return of post addressed to me at Morley s Hotel in London I enclose six postage stamps to cover the postage of the same and remain yours faithfully John Adamson —after the receipt of that letter I received a second letter which I re-directed according to the instructions in this—this is the letter the one sent by Mr Chapman —I directed it to Morley s Hotel Cross-examined Q You do not know the prisoner at all A I do not JAMES MACLEAN I am a street-sweeper in Palace-yard On 16th April last between 10 and 11 o clock I was in New Palace-yard at my crossing on the Parliament-street side—the prisoner came up to me and asked if I had any objection to do a bit of a job for him—I said no—he gave me a note and told me I was to take it to Morley s Hotel Charing-cross and get some letters—he gave as a reason for employing me that the porter was not in the way at the hotel—I did not ask him what hotel—I asked him where I was to deliver the letters and he told me at the King s Head—there is no Such house—there is the King s Arms—I thought he might have made a mistake—he came out of the King s Arms and I thought he meant that—I went with his letter to Morley s Hotel and delivered it—the porter told me no letters had arrived that morning for Mr Adamson—this is the note I took—I then came away and went to the King s Arms—I inquired if Mr Adam-son was there and they did not know such a person—I then went to Fendall s Hotel and made inquiry there and then I went to my crossing—after I had been there some little time a person who had Been the prisoner send me with the letter came up to me and gave me some information in consequence of which I went to the passage by St Margaret s Church and there found the prisoner—he was standing in the passage—I went up to him and told him that I had been to the hotel but could not see him there and I said There were no letters for you this morning Sir but the porter told me there might be some in the afternoon —he asked me if I would go in the afternoon—he told me it would not be convenient for him to meet me there that I was to meet him in front of the Horse Guards in the open space on the park side—he gave me 1s for my trouble—I offered him the note back and said Here is the note Sir and he said Take the note if you go in the afternoon —I afterwards gave the note to the policeman—I had it in my possession when I was taken to Scotland-yard Cross-examined Q How long have you occupied this crossing A About fifteen months—it is the crossing from Fendall s Hotel to Westminster Hall—I am occasionally sent on messages for papers by gentlemen connected with the courts and also from the House WILLIAM BLACKER policeman A 213 On Saturday 16th April I was watching near Morley s Hotel—about half-past 10 o clock I saw M Lean go in and afterwards come out again I followed him to the King s Arms Bridge-street Westminster—he then went to another house and afterwards to his crossing—I subsequently saw him go across to the passage between the garden and the Abbey and there I saw the prisoner—I saw M Lean go up to him and they stood there together for about a minute or two apparently in conversation—I saw the prisoner with some silver in his hand I saw him give M Lean something I could not say what it was and M Lean came away—I then went up to the prisoner and asked him if his name was Adamson—he said it was not—I asked him if he had sent that man pointing to M Lean to Morley s Hotel for some letters addressed to Mr Adamson that he expected from Liverpool—he said he did not send him there—I then told him that he must consider himself in my custody upon a charge of forgery that he had committed in Yorkshire—he said Oh and was very much agitated Cross-examined Q I suppose you generally find persons not very well pleased when you take them into custody A I should say they were not—I was not in plain clothes—I put these questions to him before I told him what the charge was I thought that was right—I had seen him speaking to M Lean—I had spoken to M Lean before that and when he left the prisoner I made a motion to him and he said That is the man —I put the questions to him for the purpose of taking him into custody COURT Q Had you any communication with M Lean at an earlier part of the day A When he came out of the King s Arms I went and spoke to him GUILTY Aged

ABRAHAM BAUER I am a banker residing in Leadenhall-street I know the prisoner I recollect his calling on me about the 20th or 22nd Dec —he called to inquire whether we could discount some foreign bills of first class drawn on bankers—I told him the first requirement was to inquire about the parties and after a knowledge of the bills being on respectable persons we would not object—he left this bill with me to make inquiries about it—he called again in perhaps three or four days afterwards but in the mean time we had not got sufficient knowledge of the parties he came two or three times between his first call and 1st Jan during which time we had made inquiries—he said he was very much pressed for money that all his money was run oat and he wanted at least 40l for his private use on account of the bill——he drew a check on my bank and I paid him 40l in sovereigns in part payment of the bill—we had reason to believe the bill was not in order and on 5th Jan I wrote him this note Sir your bill has been returned from Paris please to call at our bank —the prisoner spoke broken English—before he came to me I sent to him again about the 14th or 15th Jan but I had heard from him—he sent two or three messengers for the balance of the bill—I told them that he must come himself and on the 15th Jan I sent a clerk of mine to desire him to call and I received from him this answer written in French which has no date to it—I can swear I received it about the 15th Jan — Sir I have only received this instant your card I regret that indisposition retains me from coming to you I shall be glad if you will inform me whether you are satisfied with the inquiriesyouhave made and whether you will be satisfied with a friend calling on my account that I may authorise somebody to receive for me to avoid myself going out should however my presence be indispensable I will do my possible to come to you —I wrote to him again on the 17th— Sir the inquiries about Mr Lamache are satisfactory but the bill of exchange is not yet negotiated the object of my writing was to get him to come—I meant that the bill was not gone out of my possession Mr Lamache is a man in good circumstances and it would have been satisfactory if the bill was not a forgery—the prisoner did not reply to this letter after the 17th the first that I heard about him afterwards was on the 18th Feb when he was arrested by Monteaux the bankers in Cornhill JOHN SPITTLE City-policeman On 18th Feb I took the prisoner into custody at Messrs Monteaux Brothers bullion dealers Cornhill—Mr Shuloff gave him in charge for uttering two forged bills of exchange each for 5 000 francs—I told the prisoner through Mr Shuloff who interpreted what he was charged with—the prisoner said he first wished to go to Mr Bauer to pay him 40l he owed him—I found on him two pistols loaded with ball and capped one in his right hand trowsers pocket the other in his left breast pocket of his coat—a pack of playing cards fifteen duplicates a passport a purse containing 9s 7 1/2 d and various papers two of them are letters JEAN ALFRED MAHIEU I live in Cherbourg I am a merchant and discounter There is no other merchant and discounter in Cherbourg of my name—this is not my signature to this paper as drawer of the bill—I know Mr Lamache of Saint Vaast he is a banker I know his writing I have seen him write—this acceptance is not his writing—supposing these signatures of the drawer and acceptor were genuine this is a properly drawn bill according to the law of France Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Do you sign your bills J Mahieu A No Alfred Mahieu —I am known rather as Alfred than Jean—Mahieu is not a very common name—there are other Mahieus—Mr Lamache is an old man—he does not do these things by his clerks—no other persons sign for him—he is not very old he is about seventy—he is not able to travel he is a weak man he has not good health—none of the clerks in his house are here MR RIBTON Q The name of Mahieu is not a very common name A No there are others—there is no other Mahieu who is in a situation to be a bill discounter—I know one Mahieu who is a shipbuilder but his name is B Mahieu—I know his handwriting I have seen it several times—the other Mahieus are in low situations—persons that work for their money—I do not sign my first name in full I put Alffor Alfred and drop the Jean—I taw Mr Lamache on 5th May—I have no doubt about this not being his signature HENRY ROUGEMENT I am a merchant and live in Winchester-buildings I recollect the prisoner calling on me in March 1852 at that time he went by the name of De Fontaine—he came to get me to advance money on some bills—these are them—there are six of them—the amount of them is 700l odd sterling—he represented them to be bond fide on some property he had sold—they are all drawn by Debris and accepted by Lamache—I advanced him 270l on them—I will not be sure but I think I did not advance that on the first occasion—the prisoner called to receive some more money on them but I had received information which prevented my giving it—he called another day I told him I had received information that they were forgeries—he said he would call again to pay the money—I have never been paid these bills—I am not acquainted with the drawer or acceptor or the handwriting of either of them I sent one of these bills and it was sent back—it was not due when I sent it—I ascertained that the whole lot were forgeries JEAN ALFRED MAHIEU re-examined None of the acceptances on these bills is Mr Lamache s writing GUILTY of uttering

it up JOSHUA MONKTON police inspector C On 19th March Barker came to me at the station and I went back with him to Mr Stocken s shop—I saw the prisoner there—I had the note with me—I showed it to the prisoner and asked him if it belonged to him—he replied Yes and said that he had received it in a bet—I noticed the number of the note at the time and also the writing upon it—this is the note—I marked it—it is No 94 650 HENRY COOK I am a tobacconist at No 9A Mortimer-street Cavendish-square On Saturday 12th March last between 8 and 9 o clock in the evening the prisoner came to my shop for a box of cigars—I showed him several sorts—he took one and smoked it and sat in the shop—he approved of it—the price was one guinea a box—I asked if I should send them—he said Yes and wrote his address

them on and kept them on and left his old ones—he told mo to take them to his lodgings and a bottle of waterproof varnish as well—he gave me a 5l note in payment—I went into the counting house to make

days afterwards I gave the note to Lovett our porter—I had in the meantime kept it in a desk in the counting house—I had looked at it several times—on the Wednesday night when I found it was a forgery I went to No 43 Essex-street Strand—I could find no such person as Charles Clifford there—I took the note to the Bank of England and it was returned stamped Forged Prisoner Q Did you ever tee me before I entered your shop on that day A Not to my knowledge—I did not askyouif you would have a pair of boots like the last pair you had of us—I asked if yen were a customer there before you said you had only had one pair before at oar shop—we worked for a party of the name of Clifford that was why I asked you COURT Q How long was he in the shop A About twenty minutes or half an hoar to the best of my opinion—there was no other customer there at the time—a niece of Mrs Baun s was in the shop—I am certain the prisoner is the person JOHN LOVETT I am a porter in the service of Mrs Baun In March last Mrs Baun s nephew gave me a 5l note to get changed—I did not take any notice of it I merely took it in my hand and ran over to get change JAMES M CARTHY re-examined I saw the note handed to

partnership with my brother as hosiers at 31 Piccadilly On Wednesday evening 16th March between 5 and 6 o clock in the evening the prisoner came to my shop and wished to see some dressing or morning jackets—I think I had served him on a former occasion—he did not choose any—he gave his name and address Charles Watson 12 Abbey-place St John s Wood where I was to send some for him to look at on the following morning—he wrote down the name in my order book in pencil and I afterwards inked it over—here it is producing the book —before he left the shop he said he wanted some once-round scarfs—he selected two—they came to 10s 6d each—he gave me a 5l note to change and I gave him 3l 19s —I put the note in my till that night—there were no other notes there—about middle day on Thursday I sent it

COURT Q You did not mark the note before sending it out to be changed A No I had not received any other 5l note in the course of the morning—that was the only 5l note in the till—I am quite certain

PRICE I am in the service of Messrs Drew On the evening of 17th March I took a parcel to 12 Abbey-place St John s Wood—I inquired for Mr Watson—I could find no such person—afterwards on that same day

the shop about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I was serving him WILLIAM WTBIRD I am an inspector of notes at the Bank of England This note with C Clifford in the corner is a forgery in every respect—the paper is not genuine the signature is a forgery—the No is 94650—the other 5l note is also a forgery it bears the same number as the other—in my judgment they are from the same plate the two are identical—the dates and signatures are alike—there is an attempt to represent the water mark—this third 5l note is No 94659—that purports to be signed by a cashier named Bark it is a forgery in every respect—I believe the number is printed—we fill in the number after the note is engraved—this fourth 5l note is also a forgery in all respects that is No 66045—this 10l note is also a forgery in the same respects as the others—it is No 65650—it is not the practice of the Bank to issue two notes of the same amount number and date Prisoner I have nothing to say GUILTY Aged 19 — Transported

BODKIN and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution FREDERICK JOHN WHITEMAN I am an engraver and printer of No 19 Little Queen-street Lincoln s Inn-fields On Saturday 11th June about the middle of the day the prisoner Broese came to my shop he gave me his name Buray but not on that occasion —he said he wanted a plate made exactly like a tracing and produced a small piece of paper which he had back from me with the proofs—I have not seen it since this is it produced —there were two pieces of paper one was the tracing and the other was a piece printed in red ink—he said he wanted a plate made exactly like the patterns and inquired the price I told him about 25s or 30s —he said he did not think the person it was for was particular to 4s or 5s but he would ask him first and call again—he said he should very likely want a great number done perhaps 1 000 but he should want 200 at first—he then took both the papers away—as far as I can recollect of the piece he took away it would correspond in size with the piece cut out of this note produced —I should think it would have fitted into it—I returned him the tracing and the little bit of paper that was to show me the kind of margin there was to be to it—he said he wanted it exactly like the tracing and the small piece of paper that was printed in red ink and to be very particular to do it in every respect like the red printing—at 6 o clock on the same evening he came again with the same small piece of paper he left the papers with me requesting me to execute the order he had given me in the morning—I asked him his name he wrote it down on a small piece of paper—this is it I think produced Mr Burai was written on it he wrote it except the first letter—I asked his address at first he seemed surprised and did not seem willing to give it—he did not give it and I did not press him—I told him it was usual for strangers to leave a deposit I should require 12s 6d —he left 5s and said he would call again on Monday and bring the remainder of the deposit and some paper that he wanted printed—he wished the paper printed from the plate—this is the paper that he brought produced —he brought it on the Monday or Tuesday evening about 6 o clock and said he should want it printed from the plate which I was to make—he also brought a piece of paper with some writing on it this produced is it it was brought that I might make out some of the words more distinctly—they are the same words on the tracing and on the paper they are more legible on the paper—the letters are extremely small on the tracing—he said he should want 200 done and should want the proofs first to show this other person—he said he would call on the following evening Tuesday for it he gave me another 5s as a deposit and left—on the Tuesday evening between and 7 o clock he called again the plate was then partially engraved it was engraved from the tracing with the assistance of the letters on the paper—he examined it and said he thought we were doing it very well—he asked when he could have a proof I told him I would endeavour to let him have one on Thursday—on the Monday I had called on the Dutch Consul and made a communication to him—in the proceedings I took afterwards I acted by his directions—on the Thursday Broese called about o clock in the evening and asked if the proof was ready—I told him we had not finished the plate and we would have one ready on the Friday evening for him—he left the remainder of the deposit 2s 6d and called again on the Friday evening and asked if the proof was ready—I had about a dozen of them printed and gave ten of them to him—he examined them and pointed out one or two necessary alterations—he said he must show them the other person and took them away—he returned almost immediately and asked for the small piece of paper printed in red ink I gave it to him and he left saying he would call again that evening or early the next morning—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I have got the plate I engraved it is complete with the exception of the alterations which the prisoner directed me to make they were not made—the ten impressions I gave him were impressions from the plate—he spoke to me during the whole of the time in English and seemed to understand my answers very well—I understood him very distinctly—I thought he spoke English very well for a foreigner DANIEL FORRESTER I am an officer of the police of the City In consequence of a communication from Mr Whiteman I went with him to the Consul-General of the Netherlands on 13th or 14th June—I received instructions from the Consul and on Thursday 16th June went to Mr Whiteman s shop about 7 o clock in the evening—I was secreted in the back parlour and saw Broese in the shop—I remained on the spot till he came out and then followed him out and saw De Leenu standing still at the bottom of Great Queen-street near Lincoln s-inn Fields—he was just on the move almost standing still and looking about him about thirty or forty yards from Mr Whiteman s shop—Broese went in that direction but proceeded along Lincoln s Inn-fields—De Leenu followed and when they came near Turnstile they joined company—I followed them they walked together apparently in conversation—when they came to the Globe Insurance in Cornhill Broese turned to the right towards London-bridge and De Leenu went in the direction of Whitechapel—I followed him and missed him near Gulstone-street—I went again on the Friday evening to the same neighbourhood with Inspector Shaw and an officer named Williamson—we took up our position so that we could see Mr Whiteman s shop—about 6 o clock I saw Broese coming along and pointed him out to them—he entered Mr Whiteman s shop and further up Little Queen-street towards Holborn I saw De Leenu standing on the right hand side of the way and drew Shaw s attention to him—he was about forty yards from the shop—I saw Broese come out of the shop and go towards Holborn towards where De Leenu stood but he suddenly turned back again and re-entered the shop of Mr Whiteman and at that time De Leenu came towards the shop towards Great Queen-street—he continued to advance but I lost sight of him for a short time because I kept my eye on the door till Broese came out again which he did in a minute or two and turned into Great Queen-street towards Long Acre—I went into the street and saw the prisoners on opposite sides of the way both going westwards—I think Broese came over to De Leenu and then they walked in company together till they got into Long Acre when we took them into custody—I took hold of De Leenu and took this pocket book from his hand in which I found one of Mr Whiteman s cards and the card of another engraver in Holborn also a note of the Bank of the Netherlands with a piece cot out of the margin also this list produced —I believe it is in Dutch— this being interpreted contained the following list of articles with their prices a screw 1s 8d a file 5d a leather 9d paper 7d paint a small piece 8d pens 6d pencils 6d paper for notes 2s plate 1s printing 1s coupons 7s changing a note 2s ink and pumice stone 2d gum and lead 3d —I also found this paper produced on which is the tracing of part of a note this being read had 1000 on the upper part and 40 at the bottom —the prisoners were then taken to the station house—I told Broese he was charged with having a plate engraved to represent an Amsterdam bank note and asked him by whose order he got it done—I told him he was not bound to answer me without he pleased—he told me that a person of the name of Smith living in John-street employed him to get it done—I could not make out who he meant by Smith of John-street and he pointed to De Leenu and said That is not the man —he did not tell me what John-street or give me a description of the person—he declared that he did not know De Leenu and that he had never seen him before—I asked him if he was quite sure of that—he said Yes —that was in De Leenu s presence—as far as I could understand him he said he was asking De Leenu to direct him to some place and that he was directing him and De Leenu at the time they were apprehended said so also—one of them gave the address No 10 Tenterden-street Whitechapel they both said they lived there—I went to Whitechapel—I could not find Tenterden-street but found Tenter-street—I could not ascertain correctly that Broese lived there but I ascertained that De Leenu did—I went into a kitchen of that house which was used as a bedroom also and on a chest of drawers there I found this parcel produced tied up in this way in which I found three Amsterdam bank notes and this glass frame—I cannot say whether it might be used for taking tracings it is a pane of plain glass not looking glass—in the same bundle I found some crow quills some black lead pencils a knife a piece of wax three pieces of pumice stone three pieces of red paint some black chalk Indian rubber some gum arabic a small fine brush a piece of white paint and a piece of Indian ink—I also found a plate pierced for water mark produced and some paper on which are tracings of parts of these notes—I have not been able to find out Broese s residence I have used all the diligence I can respecting it Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Were the two papers that the interpreter read found in the hands of De Leenu in the pocket book A Yes there was what I understand is a genuine note in the pocket book and also this tracing paper and these two cards—there was no partition in the kitchen—De Leenu and his wife and three children lived there I believe—I saw no hesitation as to his giving me his address—I should think he understood English very imperfectly—he expressed himself very imperfectly he did not say much—I mean to say he was able to speak to me about asking the direction—this is my signature to my depositions—I cannot say why I did not mention what De Leenu said to me before the Magistrate—I say on my oath that he did say that HENRY ADLARD I am an engraver and have had a good deal of experience for many years in these matters I have seen the genuine note found on De Leenu—the papers given to Mr Whiteman are all fac-simile tracings of the note copies of parts of it—the plate produced by Mr Whiteman would not produce this genuine note FREDERICK SHAW police inspector I took some papers from the person of Broese produced —I was in company with Forrester HENRY ADLARD continued I have no doubt that these ten notes have been taken from this plate and are as far as they go imitations of the genuine Amsterdam note but the genuine note is not produced from a plate but from type—this piece of lead produced is what we call the stencil plate if this is put on a piece of paper and rubbed with sweet oil or any greasy substance it produces the imitation of a watermark—I have no doubt that it has been traced from the watermark on the genuine note—this piece has been cut from the genuine note—this glass produced the crowquills red and white paint and Indian ink are all materials for making fac-similes of documents or bank notes—the glass is used to put slantways to put a strong light in order to make the tracing easy—this is tracing paper which we make fac-similes with FREDERICK JOHN WHITEMAN re-examined I gave a card of mine to Broese—that produced is one of my cards—these are nine of the notes I struck off the plate by Broese s direction CATHERINE GARNER I am a lodger at No 10 Tenter-street Whitechapel I know De Leenu—I have known him three weeks yesterday—he occupied the kitchen of that house—he has not occupied it more than two months I think—he was there when I went his wife lived with him—I cannot say whether they had any children living there Cross-examined Q Did not Broese lodge there A I cannot say that he lodged there I have frequently seen him in and out as though he had a right to come there and I saw him on the Thursday morning before he was apprehended on Friday sharpening a knife with a stone about a quarter or half-past 7 o clock MR BALLANTINE Q Did you hire a lodging there A Yes of Mr De Leenu—the front room up stain JOHANNES ADRIAAN HINSBECK through an interpreter I am chief cashier of the Netherlands Bank at Amsterdam This is one of the notes of that bank—such notes circulate in that country—these other three notes are forgeries—such notes circulate by the authority of the directors of that bank Cross-examined Q Is that a private bank A It is a company of shareholders the Government is in connection with it there is a decree of the King—the shareholders divide the profits among themselves by way of dividend like a railway company—these are the notes they issue to their customers MR BALLANTINE Q Is there any other bank in the Netherlands that issues such notes A No they are received at the Government offices through the whole country—there is not a national bank besides Broese s Defence I am not guilty of committing any forgery I had the plate engraved by order of Mr Schmidt it was merely an errand that I executed and I was paid for it the articles found at the house of De Leenu were not my property but were given into his wife s keeping by Schmidt and he gave me directions to fetch him from the railway at London-bridge he accompanied me and gave him all that is contained in the handkerchief saying Take care of this till to-morrow morning I will then fetch the proof he told me on the same evening Thursday that he would come to fetch the proof which I was to get from the engraver on Friday evening I went to fetch the proof and was taken into custody I have been very much deceived by these people BROESE— GUILTY Aged 41 — Confined One Year DE LEENU— GUILTY Aged 53 — Transported for Ten Years HENRY ISAACS

the daughter of John Wilson who keeps the Grapes public house in George-street Minories On 27th April about 4 o clock in the afternoon the prisoner came there—I was serving at the bar—he called for a glass of ale I supplied him with it it came to 2d which he paid—I knew him before as the steward of a ship—after paying for the ale he presented a piece of paper to me and asked if my father could oblige him with change I did not look at it—I handed it across to my father who was sitting behind the bar—I knew an acquaintance of the prisoner s of the name of Marshall he was the mate of the ship of which I understood the prisoner was steward—the prisoner asked if we had heard from Marshall lately I said no we had not—when I handed the note to my father he was going to mark it and the prisoner said that it was marked or that his name was upon it I do not know which—my father gave him five sovereigns change and he then went away JOHN WILSON On Thursday 27th April I received this 5l note of my daughter in the prisoner s presence I gave him five sovereigns for it and was going to mark the note when he said I have marked it pointing to this endorsement John Clark ship Carolore or some such name 25th April 1854 —I put the note in my pocket—he said Will you have a glass of ale Mr Wilson —I said No thank you not now and he went away—I paid away the note on the next Saturday in part payment of my quarter s rent it was returned to me on the following Tuesday by Mr Lambert Jones s clerk—I knew the note again by the writing on the back—this produced is it COURT Q Are you quite certain that the prisoner is the man A Yes I knew him before but not his name—he had been the mate of a ship the present owner of which uses my house JAMES BARTON I am one of the inspectors of notes at the Bank of England—this note is a forgery in every particular JULIA BAILEY I am barmaid to Mr Neale at the City Arms Millwall Poplar On Easter Monday 17th April the prisoner came there between 7 and 8 o clock in the evening—he came to the bar and asked if I could give him change for a 5l note—I told him I could not as Mrs Neale was not in the way I had known him between two and three years—he said he thought I might oblige him if I could—he had something to drink wished me good evening and went away—he paid for what he had—he returned in about half an hour in company with another man—they went into the parlour after they had been there a little while he came to the bar and asked if I could give him change and seeing Mrs Neale sitting by me he said I know that Mrs Neale will oblige me —he handed me a 5l note I handed it to Mrs Neale—she said in his hearing that she did not like the appearance of the paper—he said It is all right I got it from Tindal s office this afternoon —Mr Tindal is the ship owner in whose employ I supposed the prisoner to be—Mrs Neale then said if he would put his name on the back of it she would give him change—I handed him the ink and a newspaper to put underneath the note while he wrote but he rejected the newspaper and laid a white handkerchief of his own under it—he then took the pen and pretended to write he began to write his name upon it as I supposed—he said he had been drinking and he was all on the move and he could not write—he made a mark for a J I suppose and said There John that is what I was going to put upon it my name —he handed me back the note and I gave it to Mrs Neale she went into the bar parlour and brought him out the change—I think it was four sovereigns a half sovereign and 10s he paid separately for what he had to drink—my mistress put the note in a book along with other notes where they are always kept—the prisoner stood at the bar for several minutes in conversation and said that he was not in want of a 5l note he could get fifty 5l notes if he wanted them but they were not his own he must own that they were his wife s—he said he should see us again before he left England he then left—I saw the note again next morning when it came back from the bank it was then stamped forged as it is now—I observed upon it the J which the prisoner made Prisoner Q Did I never come to your house for change for a 5l note before A I do not know that you did—I do not know whether you had change for five or six 5l notes on Saturday nights when you were on board the Ariel—you may have come there frequently of a Saturday night—most likely you have had change for a 5l note before—we were in the habit of changing notes for you I do not know whether I have done so Prisoner The mate of the ship used to give me notes to pay the men and I generally used to get them changed at this house and at Mr Whiskins at Millwall—as to saying that I had fifty notes and they were my wife s you are speaking very false Witness I am quite certain that he used those words JAMES BARTON re-examined This note is also a forgery in every particular I should say it is from the same plate as the other the paper is identical GEORGE PAIN I keep the Duke s Head public house New-road St George s in the East On 18th April about a quarter to 8 o clock in the evening the prisoner came in and called for a glass of ale—I had known him for about three months as a customer—shortly afterwards as I was very busy at the beer engine serving customers he beckoned to me at the other end of the counter—it is a very long bar—I did not go directly and he beckoned to me again—I then went to about the middle of the bar and he said Can you oblige me —I said What with —he said With change for a five —I said I dare say I can Sir —he then took out a piece of paper I think from his waistcoat pocket it was folded up he gave it to me folded up—I unfolded it and held it up to the gas—it appeared to be a 5l note—I believe this produced to be the same note—I noticed this dark part of it on the outside as if it had been worn by carrying it in the pocket—I went to the bar parlour and got my cashbox put the note into it and took out five sovereigns which I gave to the prisoner—I said If you want 1l worth of silver you can have it —he said No that will do very well —he asked if I would take a glass of ale with him—I drew a glass and drank a portion of it—he paid for it in copper—I was then called away to serve other customers and whilst I was serving them he went away—I put the note into the bottom of my cashbox—there was one other 5l note there that had been cut in halves and pasted together again and I had endorsed it with the name of Dr Broadwater of whom I had taken it—those were the only two notes I had in the cashbox—I paid both those notes away and nine sovereigns to Fanny Cosham on the Thursday following the 20th—I did not endorse this note FANNY COSHAM I am the daughter of Mrs Cosham a baker of No 16 New-road St George s in the East On 20th April I went to Mr Pain s and gave him 19l worth of silver for two 5l notes and nine sovereigns—one of the notes had been cut in halves and pasted together with a piece of paper at the back of it and this is the other one—I gave them both to my mother and I saw her pay them to Mr Woodhouse the solicitor for Mr Mumford the miller—I saw Mr Woodhouse put my mother s name on the notes—here it is on the face of this note—I had not parted with the notes from the time I received them from Mr Pain till I gave them to my mother and she paid them at the same time to Mr Woodhouse—he was in the shop when I returned with the notes—he was paid five other notes besides these but they were all marked at the back with the name of Mr Bath a carman in Prince s-square—I am sure this is one of the notes that she paid FREDERICK WOODHOUSE I am a traveller for Mr Mumford the miller I see my writing on this note—I received it from Mrs Cosham on 20th April—Miss Cosham came in while I was there and I saw her hand two notes to her mother—I cannot swear that this is one of the notes because I took four others as well and I marked them all with Mrs Cosham s name—I did not notice whether the name of Bath was on the others JAMES BARTON re-examined This is another note from the same plate differing only in the numbers the numbers are altered—it is a forgery COURT Q Do you suppose that they are printed without the numbers A No I apprehend that they do it altogether—it appears to me to be stereotyped done from the block they only change the figures JOHN RATTON I am the son of John Ratton who keeps the St Katherine s Dock Hotel Upper East Smithfield I was at home on 24th April about 10 o clock at night—I had occasion to go to the bar and found the prisoner there drinking a glass of half and half—he had been a customer of ours for several months—he beckoned to me and I went to him—he produced this note looking at one and asked if I could oblige him with change for a 5l note—I said I dare say I could—I held it up to the light and examined it I did not like the appearance of it—I took it to my father and asked his opinion upon it—in consequence of what he said I asked the prisoner to put his name to it—I handed him a pen and ink—he said Will you be kind enough to write it for me I have been drinking and am rather nervous —I did not know his name and asked him what name I should put upon it—he gave me the name of William Edwards of the ship Caroline—I wrote those words on the note—I then took it back to my father and he gave me five sovereigns—I gave them to the prisoner and he went away—this is the note he gave me—here is my own handwriting upon it Prisoner Q Did not I tell you that I belonged to the Eliza Thornton and that I got the note from the captain for wages A No you told me nothing of the kind JAMES BARTON re-examined This is a forged note in every particular and it appears to me to be from the same plate as the others Prisoners Defence All I have to say is that I never knew of the notes being forged till the night previous to my going to Mr Fairey s after I went into Mr Fairey s and changed the note there the party that gave me these notes told me after I came out Don t go a nigh the places where you changed those notes any more for they are forged notes I never knew that they were forged till he told me I gave him part of the money and he gave me three bad 5l notes I took them home and placed them under a dressing case in my room and concealed them and never said anything to my wife about them next morning I was going down to the docks about a

living at No 3 Avery-row Bond-street On Tuesday evening 20th June about 7 o clock I was in Hanover-square the prisoner came up to me and asked me whether I could take a note for him to Mr James of No 10 Wardour-street—I said Yes he gave me the note either in the square or in George-street which is close to it—this is the note produced —after giving me the note he walked down with me to No 16 in George street and told me I was to bring an answer back to No 16 George-street—he said he would give me 1s for my trouble—I left him at No 16 George-street and went with the note—I went to Mr James it is an oilman s shop in Wardour-street—I handed the note to a shopman he took it to Mr James I did not see him open it but he came to me with the note in his hand open—he had some conversation with me and I then went back to George-street—I did not find the prisoner there—on the following Saturday I accompanied a policeman to Leicester-street near Leicester-square that was about 3 o clock—while I was there with the policeman I saw the prisoner he was walking in the street—I did not see where he went to—I afterwards went into a coffee shop in Leicester-street—there were two men in the room the prisoner was one of them—I then came out of the coffee shop and went back to the policeman—I did not return with him into the coffee shop Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q You had never seen this man whoever he was before you met him in Hanover-square had you A No it was only a few days afterwards that I saw the prisoner at the coffee shop I saw him first walking up and down Leicester-street—the policeman was not with me at that time—the policeman sent us to see whether we could see him—there was I and another boy named Marlow—the policeman sent us to see if we could see the man that had given us the notes—I knew what I was going for—I had no chat with the other boy about it because we went at different times—we did not go together he sent me first and the other boy afterwards—I had no conversation with the other boy—the policeman sent for both of us and told us to go and see whether we could see the man—he told us to go to Leicester-street to see if he was walking up and down—when I got to Leicester-street I saw two men walking up and down—Marlow was not with me then—he was not with me at all when I saw them walking up and down—I do not know whether he saw them walking up and down I believe he did Q When you first saw Mr Coyle walking up and down you had some doubt about him had you not A It was a side glance—I had no doubt about him—I said at first that I had a little doubt about him because it was a side glance—I told the policeman at first that I had a doubt about him—I did not say anything about a little doubt I said I had a doubt Q Has that doubt become fine by degrees and beautifully less has it become diminished A Yes I understand what you mean by that quotation—that doubt has not diminished since I have come here it diminished the same day—I did not look at him above half a minute when he was walking up and down the street—I did not stare at him I only walked past him once—I then returned to the policeman—I walked by his side on the same side of the way—he did not meet me face to face we were both going the same way and I walked by the side of him—I then went and told the policeman that I had some doubt—the policeman told me that I must be sure about it—he did not say or else you will be of no use —I then went to the coffee room to see him the policeman told me to go and see if he was there—he was there—then all my doubt vanished—I looked at his face more—when the policeman told me to go and see if the man was in the street he did not tell me that I should see a man walking up and down—I did not expect to see a man walking up and down—I did not think anything about where I should see him—I was only told to go and see whether he was in Leicester-street—I saw him and said I had a doubt—I was afterwards told I must be sure and to go to the coffee house I did so and became sure—I have remained sure ever since MR BODKIN Q Where was the other man walking A By the side of him—they were walking together—when I passed the prisoner I passed the other man also—I only looked at him as I went by—when I afterwards went into the coffee room both the men were there that I had seen walking in the street—I then had an opportunity of seeing the full face of the prisoner—I have no doubt of his being the person GEORGE JAMES I reside in Wardour-street On 20th June the boy Hatchman brought me a note—this is it and the envelope—this cheque was contained in it—I have a customer of the name of Ferguson—I did not think fit to comply with the request contained in the note—I went with the boy and saw Mrs Ferguson that same evening— note read Mrs Ferguson will feel greatly obliged to Mr James if he will send her change for the enclosed cheque immediately by the bearer 16 George-street Hanover-square Tuesday evening — The cheque was for ten guineas on Coutts and Co dated 20th June 1854 drawn by Eliza Armstrong payable to William Ferguson Esq or bearer with a stamped receipt on the back on which was written Received M A Ferguson June 20 1854 —Mrs Ferguson lives at 16 George-street—the name is on the door so that any person in the street would know that Mrs Ferguson lived there ALBERT MARLOW I live in Pulteney-court and work for my father who is a shoemaker On a Saturday in June I remember being in St James s Park about twenty minutes or half past 9 o clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner there—he asked me if I was in a hurry I said No —he asked me if I could take him a letter to Panton-street I said Yes —he said Come along and he took me along Spring-gardens to Dr Cross s door—he was standing at the end of Spring-gardens—the name of Dr Grass is on the door—he then gave me a letter and told me to take it to No 8 Panton-street—this is the letter and envelope produced —he told me when I got the answer to come back again and I should see him at the same place that he would be walking up and down he said that I was not to ring his bell—I wont to No 8 Panton-street with the letter and delivered it to Mr Bowen—it is a tallow chandler s shop—he opened it and said something to me—I then went back to Dr Cross s—I did not find the prisoner there he had gone—on the Saturday afterwards I went to Leicester-street—the policeman took me to Lisle-street and he pointed over and told me to go into the coffee room of a public house and told me to go in there and see if I could see anybody—I went there and saw two persons in the coffee room—they were both men—I went in by myself—I saw the prisoner there Cross-examined Q Had you gone to see for him in Leicester-street A Yes—I saw him first outside—I and the other boy did not go to Leicester-street together—we did not both go back to the policeman together the other one went back first—I did not know the other boy before I know him now—we have not been playing together since we have met together—we have not talked this matter over—I have never been a witness before—it is rather an important event in my life—I have not talked about this matter with the other lad whether the prisoner was the man or no—we have said a word we have talked about it Q You knew that there was some question whether he was the man did you not A I knew he was the man—the other boy did not tell me that he doubted his being the man—I heard of his doubting when he came back to the policeman—that was not when I went back to the policeman it was before I went to see—he said he had a doubt—he said he could not get to see him—I did not go to the coffee room with the other lad—he waited outside—we went together afterwards—we went together to the door—we went in at separate times—we did not go in together—the policeman came in along with me and I saw Mr Coyle there sitting down—the other man that was with him was a very stout man—they were not talking or sitting together—Mr Coyle was sitting by himself and the other gentleman was sitting at the other side of the room—I then selected Mr Coyle as the man who had given me the note on the Saturday before—I recollect the other boy coming back to the policeman and saying that he had some doubt—the policeman did not say to me and him You must be sure about him not that I am aware of—I did not hear that—the policeman told me that I was not to say the wrong man I was to be sure and say the right man—he told me that the first time when I went to the public house to see him—he did not tell me that I should see the man in the public house he told me to go in there and see if I could see the man who gave me the letter—I and Hatchman walked together as far as the door of the public house—I only said as I went I will go in first —we had not talked at all about it as to whether he was the man or no—I know that Mr Coyle denies being the man—I have not talked that over with the other boy—we have said we were sure he was the man not over and over again about once or twice—I said I was sure he was the man because I was sure—I said to the other boy that I was sure—I said just now that I had talked it over with Hatch-man and both of us had said that we were sure he was the man COURT Q Did you and Hatchman talk it over together whether he was the man or not A Yes I said I was sure he was the man and he said Yes he was quite sure it was him—there was nothing more MR PARRY Q Did you talk this over more than once A Yes about twice—I do not mean by that three times I mean twice—there was not any doubt expressed—we both told each other we were sure—I said I was sure he was the man without his saying anything to me first and then he said he was sure and nothing else—we said it twice on the same Saturday—it was half-past 9 o clock at night that I saw the man MR BODKIN Q Was it daylight A No it was dark—the gas was lighted—I first saw the policeman on the Saturday when he came to my house—Mr Bowen where I took the letter knew where I lived—it was about the middle of the day that the policeman came to my house I did not go with him directly—he came for me at night—I saw the other boy Hatchman on the Friday night—I went to Lisle-street along with the policeman and he was there—I went twice—I went first on the Thursday night and Mr Coyle was not there I went to look for him—I saw several men in the street that Thursday night I did not see one that I recognized—I went again on the Friday about 7 o clock I did not see any one then that I recognized—I went again on the Saturday night and then I saw him—I first saw him in the street he was standing up talking to another person—I knew him then—that was before he went into the coffee-room JAMES BOWEN I am an oilman in Panton-street Haymarket On Saturday evening 17th June last Mprlow came to my shop with this note containing this cheque—I have a customer named Dr Cross—I did not comply with the request in the note—I detained the note and the cheque— note read Dr Cross will feel obliged if Mr Bowen will send him change for the inclosed cheque by the bearer 20 New-street Spring-gardens Mr Bowen 9 Panton-street Haymarket The cheque was dated 17th June on Messrs Coutts for 11l 11s drawn by Matthew Frost payable to Dr Cross or bearer and contained the words Received Dr Cross upon a stamp WILLIAM EDWARDS I am in the employment of Mr Burnett a linen-draper of Covent-garden—I was in Bury-street St James s on 21st June between 6 and 7 o clock in the evening and met a person who spoke to me—it was the prisoner—as I was crossing the road he said Here Jack will you take a note for me to No 11 Jermyn-street I said Yes —I was to wait for an answer and to meet him at the step of Mr Pearce s door No 10 Bury-street—it was in Great Ryder-street that I saw the prisoner that is close by—I saw the house that he referred to as Mr Pearce s—I am not sure whether there was a name on the door—he said I should have a shilling—this is the note that I took—I came away without an answer Mr Pearce came with me—when I got back to Mr Pearce s I did not find the prisoner there he was gone Cross-examined Q You do not know the other two boys at all do you A No—I first saw Mr Coyle afterwards at the police court—he was in the dock before the Magistrate I thought it was the Judge—at first when I saw him I did not think he was the man—the magistrate ordered him to put his hat on and then I recognised him—it was a black hat—I did not notice anything remarkable about the hat—when I first saw him I said I did not think he was the man—that was while I was in Court before I was examined—I am not sure exactly what the policeman said to me I think he said You must be sure it is the man but I will not be sure what he said—I said he had on a grey sandy-coloured alpaca coat a sort of mixture—I remembered principally the coat of the man I saw the coat that he had on—I did not see any alpaca coat while he was in the Court—I gave my evidence last—I did not hear the other boys examined I was in the passage at the time they were examined not in the Court—I was aware that they were being examined—I saw them in the passage—I do not think the policeman told me anything about the boys—I was talking to the boys about it I told them where I met him and what sort of coat he had on and then they said to me Yes that was the sort of coat that I saw him in —I do not recollect very well what I said then or whether they said any more—that conversation took place before I went into Court—they went in afterwards and gave their evidence before me—I do not recollect their telling me that they were sure about the man MR BODKIN Q Did you have this talk with the other boys after you had been before the magistrate or before A Before—neither of them had been before the Magistrate then—there were some gentlemen standing about the same part of the Court as the prisoner when I was asked to look round for the person there was no person in the dock with the prisoner at the time—I will not be sure whether there were persons standing between the prisoner and me when I looked at him I do not recollect whether there were—when his hat was put on I believe all the people put on their hats—I do not remember any person standing between me and the prisoner—I remember going round to where the prisoner stood I went round behind and then I pointed him out—I went through some other gentlemen before I came to the prisoner—they had their hate on RICHARD MULLENS I am solicitor for the prosecution—I was in attendance at the Marlborough-street Police-court when this matter was inquired into—Mr Hardwick was the Magistrate—I was present when the last witness was examined—the prisoner was standing in the dock which is towards one end of the Court and immediately at the back of which the spectators stand—I think there were from twenty-five to thirty persons standing there—a rail separates the dock from the public part of the Court—there is a bar in front as well as a bar at the back—it is a simple wooden rail and the spectators stand immediately at the back of the rail not in the same space as the dock—the prisoners stand between two rails and the spectators at the back and at the side—I remember Mr Hardwick directing the persons to put on their hats from twenty-five to thirty persons put on their hats—there was no other person in the dock COURT Q Has the lad described truly what you saw A Yes except that he has hardly described that he went into the body of the crowd and then he pointed out the prisoner Cross-examined Q Do I understand you that he did not point out the prisoner until his hat was put on A Certainly not—he saw him but not above three or four minutes before his hat was put on just while I was examining him—I was sitting to the left of the witness box—the person who stands in the witness box is not elevated I think the box is level with the floor—I was never in it and do not know—the dock is barred off from the spectators but not from everybody—a prisoner generally has several police officers standing by his side GEORGE NISBETT I am a wine merchant in Jermyn-street I remember the witness Edwards bringing me this note—it contained this cheque— read— Mrs Pearce will feel obliged to Mr Nisbett if he will send her change for the enclosed cheque immediately by the bearer 10 Bury-street St James s Wednesday evening To Mr Nisbett 11 Jermyn-street The cheque was on Coutts and Co for 13l 12s drawn by Henry Arbuthnot payable to Mr C Pearce or bearer with the words Received M A Pearce on a stamp —I have a customer of the name of Pearce at No 10 Bury-street and he happened to be in my shop at the very time this note was presented and went with the boy CHARLES PEARCE I reside at No 10 Bury-street St James s I am acquainted with Mr Nisbett—I happened to be at his house on 21st June when the boy brought this note in—it is not my wife s writing—I know nothing whatever about it—I accompanied the boy back to Bury-street with a policeman but did not see anybody there—I think some man came to the door and knocked and made some inquiry—I asked the lad if that was the man and he said No it was some stranger EDWARD WILLIAM STANLEY I am a cashier in the house of Coutts and Co bankers in the Strand Neither of the parties purporting to draw these three cheques have any account at our house MARY EGGINS I live at No 2 Lisle-street Leicester-square and let lodgings The prisoner and his wife lodged at our house in the early part of June—he was in debt for rent—at the time he left it was 11l that was on 14th June—at the time I had some conversation with him about a cheque he owed me 8l or 9l I suppose—I pressed him to pay it—that was about the end of May—he showed me a cheque on Messrs Coutts bank for 15l —he said it would be cashed on 12th June and then he would pay me or before then if he could get it cashed—it was an engraved form of cheque like these produced—I did not notice the name of the person drawing the cheque—I think it was payable to William Coyle or bearer—in consequence of that I waited until 13th June—I then went up to his room again on the subject —he rang his bell for me—he showed me the same cheque again—he gave it into my hand and said You see it is written on Cannot be paid until the 22nd —I saw those words written on the right hand side of the cheque at the bottom—I said I did not understand cheques or bills I would take it down to my brother and show him—I was about to leave the room with it for that purpose—I had got as far as the door and had got the door open and called to my brother when Mr Coyle took the cheque from me and both he and his wife said No —they would not allow their cheque to be taken down stairs—I said I would bring it back immediately—he took the cheque from me and ran and put it into the fire—I called my sister who came into the room immediately—I said He has burnt the cheque take it out of the fire —it was not all burnt at the time—she was going to the fire and he caught her by the neck of her dress and held her fast and his wife took the poker and poked the cheque into the fire so as entirely to destroy it—they left the lodging next day the 14th—they left an empty trunk behind them and a few articles in a hat box which the police took possession of Cross-examined Q I believe you were not examined at the police court in this matter A No—the prisoner had lodged with me from 17th Nov last—the rent was paid weekly it was 13s a week—Mrs Coyle said that he was doing business and he said he was doing business for several noble-men and their money came in in large sums therefore they could not pay every week—I do not know whether he was a betting or sporting man—I do not know a brother of his a celebrated sporting man—I did not know the prisoner before he lodged with me—I did not know that he or his brother were connected with sporting or racing or betting—I have heard that he has a brother but I do not know him myself ROBERT MARTIN policeman C 86 I took the prisoner into custody on this charge in Leicester-street Leicester-square in the coffee room of a public house—I produce a box that was found at his lodging it contains gambling instruments Cross-examined Q Did you know that he was waiting there when you sent the boys A I did not at the time—I heard that three or four parties that he knew were there—I had made inquiries—I do not know whether he was there of his own accord MR PARRY to MISS EGGINS Q Had the prisoner paid you about 9l of rent altogether A He paid two sums of 4l 7s and 2l 12s which led us to have confidence in him GUILTY Aged 45 — Transported for Fifteen Years

t18540918-1009  1009 STEPHEN RESTIEUX feloniously uttering a forged 5l Bank of England note with intent to defraud MESSRS CLARKSON and GIFFARD conducted the Prosecution MR ROBINSON on behalf of the prisoner objected to MR CLAMOR opening to the JURY evidence of the uttering of forged notes subsequently to the one in question MR CLARKSON stated that he offered it as proof of guilty knowledge and that it was the constant practice to do so The COURT having consulted MR JUSTICE ERLE was of opinion that evidence could be given of a subsequent uttering occurring about the same time as that in question and as in this case the subsequent uttering being within a fortnight of the former one the evidence was receivable HANNAH BANFIELD I was lately assisting Mr Brown a baker of No 3 High Holborn as shop woman it is a post—office as well On 27th July a little before 9 o clock in the morning the prisoner came and I served him with a penny loaf which he paid me for with 1d —he then said This is a post-office I will take 1l worth of stamps if you will give me change for a 5l note —he gave me a note folded which I took into Mr Brown who came into the shop and gave the prisoner the change and I gave him the stamps—he said he would take 30s worth of stamps and I gave him an additional 10s worth—I have not the least doubt that the prisoner is the man—I saw him next in the cell at Bow—street with many others and picked him out Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Were you told that he was there A No I understood that he was at the station from Brown who said he had apprehended the prisoner the day previous—it was on a Wednesday in the beginning of Aug that I saw him—nearly a fortnight after I saw him in the shop—I had never seen him before—I do not know Franks—I had never seen him before but he may have been in the shop without my taking any notice of him as so many persons come to the shop we have a great many customers EDWIN CHARLES BROWN I keep a baker s shop and post—office in Holborn On Wednesday 27th July about 9 o clock in the morning my servant brought me this 5l note produced it was very yellow and dirty—I put it in my cash box—I had other notes there two 10l and one 5l notes and I paid them away about 1 o clock to Mr Potter who came from the Post—office MR Potter calls one week and Mr Gray another week they come on Thursdays —the other 5l note in the cash box was clean—I paid Mr Potter 30l two 10l notes and two 5l notes one of which was the one that I received from the prisoner—it is my practice to put the Post—office stamp upon the notes I pay to Mr Potter—this Holborn Ban in green ink is the stamp I so put on—I saw the prisoner leave the shop—there was no writing on the note when I received it—these two 10l and this 5l note produced are the other notes I paid to Mr Potter they are stamped in the same way and I swear to them—on the following day I saw Mr Potter and he returned me the dirty 5l note Cross-examined Q Have you any independent recollection of where you got this genuine 5l note except from what is on it A No I cannot tell you who I took the two 10l notes of—I am in the habit of taking a good many notes but it is only those that I pay to the Post-office that I stamp in this way—I cannot positively swear to the prisoner but to the best of my belief he is the man—my cashbox locks and I keep the key when my wife goes to it she has to ask me for the key if she does not know where to find it she goes to it when she likes but she does not generally give change for notes—I know Franks by seeing him come into the shop occasionally—I cannot tell how long he has been a customer—I have been in the shop three years and his face is not very familiar to me but I recognised his features MR CLARKSON Q Do you recollect Franks coming to the shop in Aug when you were complaining of the loss A Yes and I saw him—I am perfectly sure that I took this 5l note on that day at 9 o clock I had put no other notes into the cashbox before the collector came CHARLES JAMES POTTER I am a collector in the service of the Post-office it is my duty to collect the money received from the office keepers for postage matters—on 27th July I received these four notes produced from Mr Brown of High Holborn and on reaching the General Post—office I made my mark on them—they were according to the ordinary practice sent to the Bank of England next day to be carried to the public account —one of them was returned to me on the 28th—that was the dirty note I immediately returned it to Mr Brown WILLIAM CROFTS I am clerk to Richard Baines Armstrong of Staple Inn This is my mark upon this clean 5l note that was written on it before I parted with it—if I want change I give a note to the junior clerk to get it GEORGE KINGSTON I am barman to Mr Wakeford the landlord of the Red Lion public house Batty—street Commercial—road East On Friday 11th Aug the prisoner came to the bar between 4 and 5 o clock in the afternoon and called for a quartern of gin and a cigar he paid me with a 6d and then asked me if I could give him change for a 10l note pulling one out of his pocket and handing it to me—I handed it to my master in the bar parlour—I looked at it it was pasted at the back with two strips of postage stamp edging the same as this one produced —here are to distinct strips of paper in it—MR Wakeford then came out and asked the prisoner to write his name and address on the back of it a pen and ink were supplied to him and he wrote something on the back of the note and handed it to Mr Wakeford again who looked at it and said that it was so small and indistinct he could not read it and declined changing it—the prisoner then said that his was a foreign name and gave Mr Wakeford a card to prove his respectability Mr Wakeford still refused to change it—before he gave the card he asked Mr Wakeford to produce another note Mr Wakeford did so and handed it to the prisoner who folded it up rubbed it with his hands and then said it was a new note and would not look the same as his it had not been worn so and that his was an old note—this produced is the card he handed to my master—MR Wakeford still refused to change the note and the prisoner left the shop taking it with him—on Wednesday 23rd Aug I accompanied my master to the police court Bow—street—I believe this 10l note to be the one I handed to my master from the prisoner Cross-examined Q You were not before the Magistrate A Yes I was examined—the prisoner went away about ten minutes after giving the card—I did not make any inquiries about him—I did not at the time notice these words Price 1d per label on the paper on the back of the note—I merely noticed that it was a bit of paper of this size and colour MR CLAKSON Q Did you notice whether it was adhesive paper A Yes I did when the note was first given to me THOMAS WAKEFORD I am the landlord of the Red Lion Batty—street Commercial—road East I was in my parlour on this afternoon Kingston brought me this 10l note to change for a customer—I examined it went out saw the prisoner and asked him to write his name and address on it—he wrote something on the note but so illegibly that I could not see it and told him so—he asked me if I had any doubt about the note and said his name was Restieux—I said I had no reason to doubt it—he asked me if I had another note—I produced a 10l note and handed it to him—he rubbed it in his hand which he said would give it the same appearance as his note—I unfolded it and said that my note had a very different appearance to his and that I could trace no watermark in his note—I believe he then said If you have any doubt about it don t change it —I said You will excuse me I must decline changing it —he gave me this card produced to prove his respectability and then left—I have had it in my possession ever since—this is the 10l note produced by the prisoner I have not the slightest doubt about it GEORGE FRANKS I am a law stationer by business and live at No 39 Southampton—buildings Holborn In Aug I was managing the business of Messrs Atkinson of 94 Chancery—lane—I have known the prisoner three years and upwards he was in the habit of coming to see me at Mr Atkinson s daily or nearly so—when I have been obliged to go away I have frequently left him in charge of the shop—I remember his apprehension about a week previous to that he came to Messrs Atkinson s to me and said that he had hit upon a dodge that would be of advantage to me as well as to himself of making money—he enjoined secrecy on my part that I was not to mention what it was if I did not approve of it—he then produced a 5l note to me told me that it was a duffer and asked me what I thought of it—I looked at it and told him I thought the paper was too thick—he said that I should not have known it was a duffer if he had not told me—I said Perhaps not —he said he could get them for 1l and 10l notes for 30s and if in receiving money for my employers in the shape of notes I would ring the changes we could divide the profits between us that is to take one of his notes and substitute it for the other—I declined having anything to do with it and said that my books would show all notes I had and that I could not show any note transaction without producing the persons from whom I received them—a day or not more than two days afterwards he adverted to the subject again and pressed me to have something to do with the notes I declined and he said that the notes passed without difficulty and that they went to the Bank without detection that there was no fear and that he had done one himself in Holborn and one down Commercial—road way but did not mention the place—on a subsequent occasion probably next day or a day or two afterwards he produced to me a 10l note and asked me what I thought of it—I said I liked the appearance of that much better than the other but still I declined having anything to do with it—he still endeavoured to persuade me but I declined and was perplexed in my own mind as to what method I should adopt I thought it dangerous having any connection with any such transactions—on the last occasion or last but one he said if he was detained or any inquiry made would I state that I had given him the note and my being in a respectable position and admitting it no further inquiry would be made—I am frequently in Mr Brown s shop and I went in there accidentally when he was making a statement about a 5l note having heard which I gave information to the police and the prisoner was apprehended—I had one conversation with the prisoner previous to my giving information—I gave information on the same day as the last conversation that was the day before his apprehension and a fortnight or three weeks after I had been in Mr Brown s shop—on the evening before his apprehension and after I had given information to the police the prisoner came to me between 8 and 9 o clock I had given information between 4 and 5 o clock that same day —he came to endeavour to persuade me to pass some of these notes and produced an old 10l note with a patch on the back of it—this produced is it—he said he had some difficulty in changing it as it was so defaced and he wanted to make it appear that it had been in circulation by having some names on the back and wanted me to put my name I declined doing so—he said he thought I was going to be treacherous to him as I would not aid him—I said No —he said what hesitation could I have Write Brown Jones or Robinson or any other name —I ultimately wrote William Johnson 144 Strand —I wrote it purposely in red ink that I might know it again—he then asked me to put the date and I put 12 8 04 Cross-examined Q You put the date of the transaction itself A No—I put another date at his request to make it appear some days ago—I put 12 8 54 at his request this was after I had given information—I met a policeman in the Strand whom I had known cursorily before and gave information to him—I was very much shocked and determined to have nothing to do with it—I knew the expression duffer in other things in watches—I was charged eight or nine years ago and Mr Clarkson defended me—it was for being connected with a solicitor s clerk in getting a stamp allowed at the Stamp—office—it was for making a false affidavit—I only got two days imprisonment as a sentence as I had been in prison about five weeks—I have not been in any difficulty since that I swear—my house was never burned down nor the premises nor were they ever on fire—I have never been charged with attempting to defraud an insurance office—I think the next time I saw the prisoner after he had mentioned about the duffer was at the South Eastern Railway I used to be employed there and he used to come there to me and likewise to the shop in Chancery—lane in the evening—it was in 1848 that I was convicted—I have been calculating it and I have found now that it is six years ago—it was in June—the prisoner has met me at the railway and dined with me it was only on three or four occasions that he told me what a good thing I could make of it—it was on the last occasion that he said he hoped I was not going to be treacherous—I told him I was not going to do anything of the kind and said What should make you think so —I might have said No but I said What should make you think so —I cannot say that I did say No —I did not know Mr Brown to speak to him previous to this transaction but I have dealt at his shop for the last eighteen months—I have had cash transactions with the prisoner but never any notes JAMES BROWN policeman F 142 On Tuesday 15th Aug I took the prisoner in the Strand and told him he was charged with uttering a forged 5l note at the corner of Gray s Inn—lane—he said I don t know anything about it you have made a mistake in the person —I searched him at the station and found on him this 10l note which I took to the Bank of England by my inspector s directions—they took it to some place to be stamped and it was then returned to me with the word Forged on it ROBERT MACKENZIE police inspector I was at the Bow—street police station when the prisoner was brought there by Brown—I took the charge and asked him his name and address—he said his name was Stephen Restieux and that he resided at No 17 Ebury—street Pimlico and was a bottled ale and stout merchant and had stores at Hungerford—market—upon the forged 10l note being found upon him I explained to him the charge of having it in his possession with intent to circulate it and that whatever account he gave of it would be inquired into and if it was reasonable he would have the benefit of it but until that inquiry was made I should detain him—he stated that he received the note from a man named Franks residing at No 94 Chancery—lane a few days before to make a purchase—about 1 o clock when the prisoner was waiting the result of the inquiry at the Bank Franks came to the station and inquired for Restieux—I asked his name and address in the prisoner s presence—he said Franks No 96 Chancery—lane —I said You are the person I dare say mentioned by the prisoner as giving him the 10l note —he said No I have not had any money transaction with him for some time and that he never gave him a 10l note at all—I have endeavoured to find the persons whose names and addresses are on the back of the note but could not find any person answering to them—there is no such house as No 144 Strand the numbers go from 143 to 145 Cross-examined Q Had you ever seen Franks before A Yes as a witness at the station charging a solicitor s clerk with an assault about twelve mouths ago JAMES BARTON I am one of the inspectors of Bank notes to the Bank of England This 5l note is forged in every particular and so is the 10l note—I have not the slightest doubt about them—they are on very different paper to the Bank paper—there is no water mark but only a surface mark Cross-examined Q It is rather thick paper A Yes very clumsy the engraving does not appear to me to be good—the figures are so clumsily done if you put a genuine one against it you will notice it directly MR CLARKSON to GEORGE FRANKS Q Did you ever give a 10l note to the prisoner A Never nor a note of any description JAMES BROWN re-examined I apprehended the prisoner in consequence of a communication made to me by Franks on the previous evening Charles Purchase a farmer of Long—yard and James Hall a coachmaker of No 8 Chester-place Grays Inn—road game the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 31 — Transported

carpet to pack it in—whilst I was packing it the prisoner was sitting in my parlour with my wife—he remained there it might be an hour—after it was packed it was put into the cart—before that the prisoner gave me a 5l note—this produced is it—I can swear to it—I asked him to put his name to it—I gave him a pen and ink and he wrote upon it James Wright —here is the name he wrote—I said I had

half a pint of gin—I went and when I returned he was gone and my master after him Cross-examined Q What time of day was this A About 7 o clock JAKES CHAPMAN policeman H 80 On Wednesday evening 9th Nov I was in St George s-street Ratcliff-highway between 8 and 9 o clock and heard a cart rattling along—I stopped and listened and in about two minutes I went and found the horse and cart standing still—the prisoner was out of the cart holding the horse s head and Mr Tatham was there also—the still was in the cart—I beard the prisoner say something about a note that he had given Mr Tatham—Mr Tatham said Yes but it was a forged one —I went up directly and saw the prisoner with his hand up shoving Mr Tatham away—I asked Mr Tatham whether he bad taken a bad note—he said Yes he believed it was—I said Will you give him into custody —he did so—I said to the prisoner You must go to the station and if it is a bad note you will be detained and if not you will be set at liberty —he said he would not go and be wanted Mr Tatham to give him the bad note back again—Mr Tatham said he would not—I asked Mr Tatham to show me the note and I saw the name of James Wright written on it—another constable came up and I asked him to take the cart and I took the prisoner—as we went along he asked me how I thought he would get on—and he said Make it as easy as you can and I will give you a shilling or two or two or three or three or four I won t stand to a shilling —I told him he must ask the inspector about that—he then asked to walk on one side of the cart and me on the other to walk by himself the other policeman was leading the horse—I told him to come with me and walk behind the cart to see that nobody took anything out— he said No you walk on one side of the cart and I will walk on the other —I said No when I had charge of a prisoner I made sure of him—he made no answer to that—he afterwards said that he had got another note in his pocket and that might be a bad one—he was searched at the station and 2s 5 1/2 d and a good 5l note found on him I heard him asked his name and he said James Wright—he was asked where he lived and he said No 21 St Andrew-street near Horsemonger-lane gaol—he was then locked up and the horse and cart was taken to the greenyard—next morning I went to No 21 St Andrew-street and inquired for Mr Wright—I could not find that name—I gave a description of the person to Mrs Davies the landlady and then learnt that his name was Dobson—I searched the place—I found a desk there—I brought it away—I have the contents here—I took the desk to the station—the prisoner said it was his desk but there was nothing in it to hurt him—I met the prisoner s wife close against the station house gate and in consequence of her request I permitted her to ride in the cab with the prisoner to the police court—on the way she said to him Edward you have been duped into this you have been led into this by others —he told her to hold her tongue and not say anything for he should not—on returning from the police court I examined the desk and found a deed of apprenticeship in it of Edward Dobson to Isaac Dobson his father—the name of Perry was on the cart—it was the same cart that Mr Perry got from the greenyard next day Cross-examined Q Before you saw the name on the cart did the prisoner tell you to whom it belonged A I believe he told the

between 5 and 6 o clock—I did not know them before—they asked me to show them some black cloth to make an over coat—I cannot say which spoke first—I showed them several pieces—the tailor especially examined the cloths I mean Cracknell—he selected the piece and told me to cut off a quantity sufficient to make a coat—they selected satin for a waistcoat some doe skin for trowsers and some material for trimmings the articles came to 3l 16s —Cracknell told me to pack the parcel up that he was going into the City and would call for the parcel on his return—he then left the shop leaving Jackson there—I packed up the goods and made out the bill—I gave Jackson the bill and he gave me a 10l note—I asked him to write his name on it and he wrote J Smith and gave the note to me—I asked him for his address and wrote it myself it was Bridge-street Hoxton—there was a number but I forget it now—I gave the note to the cashier this produced is it—I got a 5l note from the cashier and 1l 4s in money which I gave to Jackson and he left the shop—about half an hour afterwards Cracknell called for the parcel I gave it him and asked him for his address he gave me the address of Cracknell Enfield —he took the parcel away with him—I solicited his favours for the future and told him we should be very glad to do business with him he said he would do so Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q I believe he took away something else besides the parcel did not he A Yes a little commission which we are in the habit of allowing—he represented himself as a tailor and selected the goods for the other man as a customer that is the custom of tailors CHARLES CRACKNELL I live at Enfield Town and have done so about twenty-five years—there are several persons of my name living at Enfield—I never saw or knew the prisoner Cracknell—he does not live at Enfield to my knowledge if he had lived at Enfield in the name of Cracknell I should have known it—the Cracknells that I know living at Enfield are market gardeners—I am a tailor—there is no other tailor of my name living at Enfield Cross-examined Q You know all the other Cracknells of Enfield intimately do you A Yes every one of them there are four or five—they are not related to me—I do not profess to extend my knowledge to their relations—I gave a list of the other Cracknells to the officer MR CLARKSON Q That was a list of the persons you knew A Yes—the prisoner was not one of them—there is no other tailor at Enfield except myself HEPHZIBAH MARKHAM I am a widow—I keep a hosier s shop at No 16 Jewin-street and am a niece of the prisoner Cracknell On 10th Feb between 10 and 12 o clock in the forenoon Cracknell came to my shop with Jackson—Cracknell said the person with him was going to Australia and was wanting something in my way—Cracknell went up stairs to see my mother his sister she was then on a visit at my hous—while he was up stairs Jackson purchased some goods I cannot recollect all of them there was some hosiery and handkerchiefs they came to 1l 2s 2 1/2 d —he said he was going to Australia and what he was purchasing he should be wanting—Cracknell afterwards came down stairs into the shop and went to Jackson—I put the articles he had purchased into paper and gave them to Jackson and he produced what appeared to be a 5l Note—I asked him if he had not got change he said No he had not —Cracknell was present at the time—I told Eliza Varley my assistant to go and get change—she was not gone long—she returned with change—I gave Jackson four sovereigns and he gave me half a crown that was in Cracknell s presence—on the following Friday the note was returned to me by Miss Vickress marked forged all over—this is it produced —on receiving the note from Miss Vickress I went with her and another friend to No 3 King-street Commercial-road East where Cracknell lived—we went in and saw him—I asked him if he could tell me anything of the person that was with him that gave me the note—he took a written note from his pocket and said he knew nothing of him any further than he had received this note—this is the note he produced— Read London Feb 13 55 Sir—You will please to deliver my parcel at the Star Coffee-house Drury-lane on Monday before 5 o clock and I will leave the money there Yours etc G Parkins To Mr Cracknell King-street Commercial-road Addressed To Mr Cracknell tailor and draper No 3 King-street Commercial-road George s-in—the East London —he said that he knew nothing further of him but that that was where he had to take the clothes to upon that I returned home—in the course of the same afternoon Cracknell called upon me—he said he was very sorry it had happened that he had got quite the amount of goods in his possession and I should not be the loser by the note—he said the goods belonged to the party that came with him or something to that effect—he then left and returned again in the evening and we went to Miss Vickress—I took 5l With me—I gave that to Mr Vickress and received this note in exchange—Cracknell and I parted at the door of Mr Vickress and went different ways—on the following Monday I went to Drury-lane in company with a friend named Friend—I went there to receive the money for the note—Monday was the time appointed by this note and I went in accordance with that suggestion—I found Cracknell there he was standing at the corner of some street—there was no such place as the Star coffee-house—we walked about for some time half an hour or more perhaps—I saw Cracknell and his brother the brother had a bundle and there was another man named Lancaster with them—Cracknell said they had been looking for the Star coffee house and could not find such a place and he could not do anything further than to give me the clothes—I went with Mr Friend and them to a public-house and Cracknell put the clothes in a parcel and gave them to us—upon receiving the clothes Mr Friend drew up this paper for me to give to Cracknell— read Received of Mr Cracknell two coats and two pairs of trowsers for money due and if not called for in a fortnight shall become my property For H Markham John Friend 19th Feb 1855 —I gave that to Cracknell and the forged note—I think his brother had the forged note in his possession at the time—I saw him give it to Cracknell—1 had given it to his brother the evening before—on the Tuesday in the following week I saw Moss the police-officer—in consequence of what I learnt from him I went next day Wednesday to the Police Court and there saw Cracknell in charge—Moss has the clothes which I received from Cracknell s brother Cross-examined Q Cracknell is your uncle A Yes he is a tailor by trade and his brother also—I have known the prisoner all my life—until within the last six or eight months he was carrying on business as a tailor on his own account—I do not know whether he was working for any firm—when he came to my house he was residing in King street Commercial-road with his wife—previously to that he lived in St Mary-axe I think—his brother did not live with him—I do not know whether King-street is near Mr Matthews s I did not know King-street before I went that day—I have heard my uncle say that he had been in the employ of a Mr Matthews for the last several months that is all I know of it—I do not know that there was any person but myself in my shop at the time the prisoner came with the exception of my assistant there might be I do not know she was not present all the time—I was in the shop the whole of the time I am perfectly clear that Cracknell was in the shop at the time the 5l note was paid—he had gone up stairs while Jackson was selecting the goods—Cracknell was in the shop when I sent my assistant out with the note for change—he was in the shop before I had done serving Jackson—I did not observe when Jackson took out the note whether he had any more notes with him—I did not observe where he took it from—when I went to King-street I found my uncle alone he was at work making up clothes it was there he showed me the written note and said he knew nothing more of the man than that was where he was to take the clothes— the day I went to Drury-lane was the day mentioned in this note—Cracknell and his brother were there and one of them had the clothes with him Mr Lancaster was there when we met them—I have never heard any imputation upon my uncle s character for honesty and integrity MR CLARKSON Q I believe you had very little knowledge of him A I have always been living in the country up to the last two years—I was not intimate with him for the last six months I knew him very well before—I had heard him say he was living in King-street—I believe he formerly kept a tailor s shop in St Mary axe—I have been there—I have known him since I have been in London two years I knew he was carrying on his business—I knew nothing further of him—I had had no dealings with him ELIZA VARLEY I am assistant to Mrs Markham On Saturday 10th Feb I remember the two prisoners coming to her shop—I saw Jackson lay a note on the counter—Mrs Markham told me in Cracknell s presence to go and change the note—I went it to vickress s gave it to Miss Vickress and she gave me change—I took the change to Mrs Markham and she gave it to Jackson—I am certain that the note I gave to Miss Vickress was the one I received from Mrs Markham MARY ANN VICKRESS I am the niece of Mr Thomas Vickress a wine merchant of No 45 Aldersgate-street On 10th Feb a 5l note was handed to me by the barmaid in Varley s presence—this is it—I wrote on it Markham No 16 Jewin-street 10—2—55 —I placed it in the desk and handed the change to the barmaid who passed it to the bar—the note was afterwards paid into the bank with other money and was afterwards returned to me stamped forged as it is now—I afterwards accompanied Mrs Markham to King-street Commercial-road we found Cracknell there—Mrs Markham asked him if he knew anything of the party that had given her the note—he said he knew nothing more of him than that he had been working for him and he believed he was going to Australia or he did not know whether he was gone—I said it was strange that he should take a party of whom he knew nothing to get a note changed with his niece—he said that he never hesitated in taking money himself from people that he knew nothing of and never saw again if it was in the way of business—he produced this note and said that was all he knew of the man he had received that communication from the party he was working for and he was to leave the clothes at the Star coffee house JOHN FRIEND I am a draper at Bromley near Bow In Feb last I accompanied Mrs Markham to Drury-lane in search of the Star coffee house I do not remember the day—I wrote this receipt in a public house in Drury-lane for Mrs Markham at her request—I understood Cracknell to say that the prisoner Jackson was not forthcoming and he would recompense her for the loss if he had the money but as he had not the money he would deposit the goods with her until such time as he had the money to give her—that was what I understood him to say but it is only from recollection—I felt no interest in the case—I heard nothing said about an accomplice HENRY FUTCHER I am shopman to Mr Winder a hosier of No 104 High-street Shoreditch On Friday evening 9th Feb about 6 o clock or half past the two prisoners came together to our shop—they bought several articles—each bought articles for himself and each paid for his own—Jackson had a dirty appearance HENRY LANCASTER I keep a beer shop in Middle-street Cloth Fair I have known Cracknell between two and three years—on Monday 12th Feb he came to my house about 2 o clock in the day—he called for a pint of ale and went into the parlour—Jackson came in about five or ten minutes afterwards and asked if there was a gentleman named Cracknell waiting—I opened the parlour and showed him in—when I went in they were talking about selling a horse—Cracknell had a horse for sale belonging to his master Mr Matthews I believe—I followed Jackson into the room I did not take notice of how they saluted each other—I was ordered to bring in a pint of spiced ale—I went for it and when I came back they were talking about the sale of a horse—I did not notice the names they called each other—I had nothing to draw my attention in particular to this matter—I cannot tell what it was that Cracknell said about the horse—they could not come to terms about the horse and they were talking about a suit of clothing—I went in and out once or twice—I cannot tell you everything—I was in there when Cracknell measured Jackson for a suit of clothes—I heard the order given—Cracknell said he would make a suit for 6l —they were to be finished on that day week—Jackson said he should be up to market on the Monday and they were to be brought to my place—they wanted change then for a note because Jackson was to pay down 1l deposit to Cracknell after he took the measure—Jackson first produced a 10l note—I could not give change for that but I could for a 5l and he then produced a 5l note—I brought it out and told Mrs Lancaster to go up and get change for 5l which she did and Jackson followed me out and came to the bar—I got the pen and ink and said Write your name down and he put down Samuel Brown —Cracknell was not present then he was in the parlour—I also saw the name of George Groom on the note above where Jackson wrote—this is the note produced —I gave Jackson change three sovereigns two half sovereigns and 1l in silver—Cracknell was in the parlour during-this time—Jackson wrote the name at the bar—Cracknell came out after I gave Jackson the change and he gave Cracknell a sovereign that he was to have for a deposit and Cracknell wrote a receipt on a bit of paper Received one sovereign and he was to have the things made that day week—they had a talk together a bit and they had another glass of ale and stopped a quarter of an hour or so at the bar and then Jackson left—I dare say Cracknell stopped half an hour or three quarters more with me talking—I put the note in my pocket and when I went to bed I put it up stairs—there was no other note—on the Friday or Saturday afterwards Cracknell returned to my house—he said I understand my niece has been taking a bad 5l note Lancaster and I hope yours is not the same —I said I hope not either —I showed him the note and he said We will go down to the bank with it on Monday morning —I think this was on Saturday—I was rather uneasy to know whether it was good or bad and I went down with it myself on the Monday—when I came back Cracknell was at my place waiting— I said Cracknell this is the same as your niece took a bad 5l note —he said Well Lancaster you shall not be the loser for I will pay you as soon as I can raise the money —I said Do because I want to pay it away —which he did he even pledged his things to make me the money—I was not present when he pledged them but I have no doubt of it—he paid me the money in three instalments—he looked at the note when I brought it back and he saw the names on it—he did not make any remark upon them—in the course of the same day I went with Cracknell to Drury-lane to see if we could find Jackson—Cracknell went to his brother s in the Strand to get the clothes—I went with him—he said he had received a letter to take them to the Star coffee house Drury-lane—he had no bundle when he started—he went up a passage near Temple-bar—I went with him but I did not go to his brother s place I waited outside—I had never been there before—I know it was his brother s because his brother came down with him with the bundle—we then went to Drury-lane and met Mrs Markham and Mr Friend Cross-examined Q Did you know Cracknell previously to this A Yes for two or three years and always found him a very honest and respectable man—I believe he was in the employ of Mr Matthews a publican for the last twelve months—he formerly kept a house in St Mary Axe as a tailor and also in Aldersgate-street—I never knew any imputation against him MR CLARKSON Q Did you know Jackson A I did not I never saw the man before that day JOSEPH TRADD I am shopman to Messrs Bartram and Harvey woollen drapers of No 74 Holborn-hill On Monday 12th Feb the prisoners came to the shop together between 5 and 6 o clock in the evening—I did not know either of them before—they conversed together at times—that enabled me to ascertain that Cracknell was a tailor—he asked for beaver cloth to make a great coat—I took some down at 10s or 11s a yard—they both looked at it—Cracknell decided it not to be good enough so I got others that were better—they decided upon what cloth they would have—took no notice of what they said to each other—they did talk to each other and they decided to have better cloth and I cut off the length they required it was only for one—Cracknell then asked for doeskins for trowsers—I showed them some—they looked at several pieces—there was some conversation between them as to the length they wanted and they purchased enough for two pairs of trowsers and two vests—Cracknell then said they wanted vestings and I passed them on to Mr Grant Cross-examined Q Look at those things some clothes produced by Moss are those the things they purchased A The only thing I could swear to would be the doeskin for the trowsers—this is it—these trowsers form a portion of the doeskin RALPH GRANT I am a shopman to Messrs Bartram and Harvey On Monday 12th Feb the two prisoners were passed on to me by the last witness—Cracknell asked to be shown some fancy silks for waistcoats—they both decided upon having a length or two for fancy waistcoats—they talked together frequently—I cut off the silk for the waistcoats and some lining—the things amounted to 5l 7s 6d —Jackson paid for them he gave me a 10l note and half a sovereign and I was to bring him in change a 5l note—I took the note and asked him to write his name at the back of it which he did—he wrote J Parkins Hoxton —this produced is the note—he wrote this in my presence—Cracknell was standing by the side of him at the time so that he could see what he wrote—I wrote on the note Grant and the date 12—2—55 —I am certain this is the note—I took it to the counting house and gave it to the cashier—I brought the change in coin and gave it to Jackson—he put it into his purse or pocket—Cracknell then took the parcel and went as far as the door with Jackson he then told Jackson he should be with him directly and he returned to the shop and got a commission—he then followed me again from the counting house to the shop where we saw Jackson looking at another piece for a waistcoat—he bought it and paid for it—during this time Cracknell spoke about Mr Bartram and he also said that he had known him when he was in Suffolk—he asked me his Christian name and I told him Cross-examined Q I believe Mr Bartram does come from Suffolk does he not A He does he is not here—I had seen Cracknell at our shop before a few times I think—I served him once myself—he buys goods which tailors ordinarily buy JOHN MOSS City policeman 225 In consequence of information on Tuesday 27th Feb I went to the Beehive public house in King-street Commercial-road East about 3 o clock in the afternoon—I went into a little room at the back which gave me the opportunity of seeing who came into the bar—about ten minutes after I was there I saw Cracknell come in in company with Lancaster—they came into the room where I was and had some ale together—I then said to Cracknell I am a police officer I must take you into custody for being concerned with another party in uttering a forged 10l Bank of England note at the shop of Messrs Bartram and Harvey Holborn-hill —he said Yes that is right I went with the party but I know nothing of him —I was about to search the prisoner—he was in the act of putting something into his pocket—he said Search me at the station —I searched him there and then I found in his pocket two forged 5l Bank of England notes—these are them looking at the two uttered to Markham and Lancaster —I found a pocket book on him—he said there was a letter in that that he had received from the party that he had been with to Bartram and Harvey s—this is it the one produced —he said that he had left the clothes that were purchased at Mrs Markham s in Jewin-street as security for the payment—I then took him to No 3 King-street—I there found three waistcoat pieces — MR GRANT TWO of these are what I cut off —he also produced to me a pawnbroker s duplicate—it referred to some doeskin and other articles pledged on 17th Feb —I examined at the pawnbroker s the things it referred to—the notes were marked Forged as they are now—Cracknell said he had paid Lancaster the money for the one and left the clothes with Mrs Markham for the other—this receipt of Mrs Markham s was in the pocket book—he said they went together to Lancaster s and had some spiced ale there and there was a 5l note changed there and that was the note—he said Lancaster had been to him and he had just paid Lancaster the last pound or something of that sort I do not recollect the exact words—he said that Lancaster kept a beer shop in Cloth-fair and he had known him for some time—I asked him if he knew anything of Jackson and he said he knew nothing of him further than going with him to these places that is Bartram and Harvey s Markham s and Lancaster s—he said that he Cracknell had lived at the Beehive as waiter for about six months and he had seen Jackson there—I asked where Jackson was most likely to be found and he said the most likely place was Tiger s-bay—I asked him where Tiger s-bay was—he said that Brunswick-street was called Tiger s-bay that it was close by the Beehive and was infested with whores and thieves that that was the most likely place to find him there with those girls Cross-examined Q Did you ever recollect this before to-day A I remember it well now—I believe that part was not mentioned before the Magistrate—my examination there was taken down and I signed it but I do not believe that part was taken—I signed it as correct—I mentioned this about Tiger s-bay at Mr Freshfield s office—I have been in the force between eleven and twelve years—I am not in the habit of omitting important evidence I have done so we do not at all times think of everything—when I was about to search Cracknell he was in the act of putting something away into his pocket—I believe I said that before the Magistrate—I said I found the note on searching him but I do not think that was explained—I said I searched him and found two notes—I did not say anything about his being in the act of putting something into his pocket—this is the first time I have given that evidence—I can explain it—I followed Cracknell and Lancaster down stairs to a room and it seemed that they were in the act of settling—Cracknell had these two notes out in his hand and was in the act of putting them away when I told him I was a police officer and must take him into custody—I did not see any money pass WILLIAM WYBIRD I am inspector of bank notes at the Bank of England These notes are all forgeries—the two 5l notes are from the same plate and the two 10l notes are from the same plate MR SLEIGH on behalf of Cracknell proposed to call the prisoner Jackson as a witness MR JUSTICE ERLE inquired whether such a course had ever been taken before MB SLEIGH was not aware that one prisoner had ever been examined on behalf of another although it was very common to examine one of the parties charged on behalf of the prosecution MR JUSTICE ERLE expressed some doubt whether it should be done the statute not having removed the so called privilege of prisoners not being liable to have any question put to them that could operate either for oragainst themselves he had never known this course adopted and whenever it had been necessary to examine a prisoner he had always gone through the form of trial and sentence or trial and acquittal so that the entire matter should be at an end before such evidence was given he would however receive the evidence if it was desired and consult the Judges on the subject Jackson was here given in charge for having been previously convicted to which fa pleaded NOT GUILTY THOMAS GOODMAN policeman S 70 I know the prisoner Jackson I was present at his trial at the June Session 1851 for sheep stealing he was convicted and sentenced—I produce the certificate of his conviction from Mr Clark s office— This being read certified the conviction of George Jackson of receiving twenty sheep and that he was sentenced to one year s imprisonment GUILTY Aged 40 — Transported for Fifteen Years GEORGE JACKSON the prisoner was then examined by Mr Sleigh as follow —I first became acquainted with Cracknell some six or seven months ago perhaps at the Beehive public house merely by going into the house as I was living close by to have a pint of beer at different times while he was in the employment of Mr Matthews—in the early part of Feb I was in communication with him—I am sorry to say that I have been wholly and solely the guilty party and I am very sorry that I did not know at the time the responsibility that was attached to the man Cracknell—he knew nothing at all of the affair nor did I know that a responsibility was attached to him for being in my company—I am sorry that I have been the means of bringing an innocent man to the bar of his country—the beginning of the transaction was the buying of a horse I do not exactly remember when it was—it was in St Martin s-lane—Mr Matthews I understood had a horse and chaise to be sold and I bid Cracknell a price for the lot which he did not think proper to accept—I think it was in Dec —I do not know the day of the month—I had these notes in my possession which the parties who employed me at St Martin s-lane had intended to pay for this horse and chaise provided a bargain had been come to—I represented to Cracknell that I was going to Australia and that I was going to buy some things and if he could recommend me to any of the parties that he dealt with I should be very happy—he said he had a niece in the hosiery line if I wanted anything of that sort shirts flannels or handkerchiefs I might as well let her have it in the way of business and we went there and passed a 5l note with her—I accompanied him to the other two places that have been mentioned upon which occasions notes were passed by me—I did not communicate to Cracknell nor did he know that either of those notes were forged—I never gave my address to Cracknell this note signed Parkins is my writing—there was such a place as the Star coffee house in Drury-lane but I understand it has since been made into a broker s shop George Matthews a licensed victualler deposed to Cracknell s good character CRACKNELL— NOT GUILTY There were two other indictments against Cracknell for uttering the other forged notes upon which no evidence was offered

piece of about seven or eight pounds and said This is a nice piece of bacon I think my mates will enjoy this and told me to weigh it—I weighed it for him and he paid me for it—he tied the things up in a handkerchief all together and went away with them—whilst I was serving him with the grocery I saw another man standing outside the door leaning against the doorpost he was dressed as a sailor in a blue jacket and blue cap—I should not know that man again—when Williams went out he and that man went off together JAMES BLANCHARD I am manager at Mr Chipchase s shoe establishment at Poplar On the

two minutes it might hare been five minutes CHRISTOPHER HARRIS Sen I am also employed in Mr Martin s shop I saw Williams come in on the morning of 4th July and ask for some pocket handkerchiefs—while he was getting them Wells came in and asked for a pair of socks—Williams produced a 5l note which my son handed to me—I said The water mark is rather fanciful I suppose it is a good one —Williams made no remark to that—I handed it to my son to get change—I asked Williams if he was just come home—he said Yes from some part of America—I do not recollect where and he was shortly going out again Williams Q Did I not tell you I had come from India A No from America—I do not know that this is the note you gave me I merely handed it to my son EDWARD MARTIN I am cashier at my brother s establishment On 4th July about 9 o clock in the morning young Harris brought a 5l note to me in the counting house—I gave him five sovereigns for it I had taken no other 5l note that morning—I was then making up a parcel of money to send to the Whitechapel Branch of the London and Westminster Bank and I put the note among it and gave it to Frederick Smith FREDERICK SMITH I am shopman and apprentice to Mr Martin On the morning of 4th July I received from Mr Martin a bag which I took to the Whitechapel Branch of the London and Westminster Bank and gave to Mr Gill THOMAS TOMLINSON GILL· I am cashier in the Whitechapel Branch of the London and Westminster Bank On the morning of 4th July I received a parcel from Smith from Mr Martin of Whitechapel—I have the particulars of the credit which I have extracted from the books—the amount of it was 82l it consisted of a 5l note No 59 608 dated 11th Jan —there was no other 5l note the rest was a 10l note and gold and silver—this note precisely corresponds with the entry I made it is No 59 608—I feel quite sure it is the same JAMES JAMES I am assistant to Messrs Dennis grocers in Church-street Hackney About 8 o clock on Wednesday evening 4th July last Williams came to the shop—he first asked for a pound of tea I served him with it—he then asked for a pound of coffee and afterwards for four pounds of loaf sugar the goods amounted to 7s 6d —he offered me a supposed to be 5l Bank of England note—he took it out of a pocket book I did not notice where he took the pocket book from—during the time I was serving him there being nobody else in the shop I had a little conversation with him—he described himself as an Australian gold digger and was telling me about his being rather fortunate in one place and unfortunate in another—I dare say he kept me serving him pretty well a quarter of an hour—he did not talk much about Australia—he said he did not like the country much there was a very rough lot about—he said I made a good deal of money but not so much as I might have done —this was while I was serving him and then he produced the note—I examined it by the feel of the paper and did not like it—I then examined it and found the signature of H Back to it—there had been a letter in the Times a few days before about notes with that signature and I tried to recollect myself and went up stairs to Mr William Dennis—I asked him what the name was that had been advertised—I did not show him the note I had it in my hand but he did not look at it—I merely said Here is one of the forged notes —I then returned into the shop and found Wells standing by the side of Williams—he had come into the shop just at the time I was going in doors to speak to Mr Dennis and just as he entered the door he called out for a pound of pic nics and said I am in a hurry —we have some biscuits called pic nics—when I returned into the shop I found him standing by the side of Williams—I walked in front of the counter and asked Williams if he knew what he had given me—Wells was close enough to near what I said—Williams replied Yes a 5l note —I said it is not a 5l note in fact it is not a note at all —I then walked behind the counter and laid the note flat on the counter thinking him to be an innocent looking man by his face to show him the signature of H Back and I said This is not the signature of the note because it is J Ferraby —Williams looked at the signature and just at the time Wells looked over his shoulder at the note—I was not holding the note very firmly and he put his hand over took hold of it and held it up to the light—he said Oh this is right enough this is one of the last issue I have got plenty of them I will change it and he put his hand into his pocket and drew out a handful of gold and silver—he took five sovereigns out and laid them on the counter—he had the note in his hand—he scrambled it up very carelessly and put it into his trowsers pocket—I pushed four of the sovereigns towards Williams and took one myself examined it and put it in the detector and then into the till—I gave Williams the change keeping the 7s 6d for the goods he had had—Williams tied up the goods in a silk pocket handkerchief and walked out—as soon as he went out I took a bag and weighed Wells his pound of pic nice—he gave me a half crown and I took 8d—as I was weighing them I called out to the lad Steed to get ready to go out immediately as I suspected they were regular smashers—just as Wells went outside the door I went to the lad pulled off his apron pointed out Wells to him and sent him oat to watch him until I could go myself—just as I was going outside the door the lad returned—in consequence of what he told me I went to the corner of Well-street and Mare-street Hackney and in a nasty little turning there I dropped upon Wells Williams and two others standing talking to each other—Wells had a parcel of goods in his hand tied up in a pocket handkerchief—it was about the bulk and appearance of the parcel I had sold to Williams—I believe Williams saw me he had his face towards me they immediately parted—Williams came towards me and Wells went the other way and the other two parted—I lost sight of them in a moment there being a lot of labouring men about there and they appeared as working men themselves—I followed Williams on account of his tendering me the note—I think he observed me to be following him he walked down Well-street and passed me—I walked into a grocer s shop to conceal myself and asked them to allow me to wait there a minute or two—I saw Wells drop the parcel of goods he was carrying and they were all scattered in the street—that was after I had followed Williams after Williams had gone down Well-street—I had to run to keep sight of him afterwards and I saw him turning back and he saw me turn into the same shop where I first went in—I afterwards saw Wells and Williams together again that was after I had seen the parcel dropped by Wells after I came out of the shop again and was walking after Williams again—Williams was on one side of the road and Wells was just across the road where he had dropped his parcel of goods—he picked them up and went into an unfinished house I suppose to put his goods to rights again and by that time Steed our lad overtook me—the goods had the appearance of those I had sold to Williams—I could not say whether the pic nics were with them—I told the lad to keep an eye upon Wells and I went on after Williams—Wells again overtook me and passed me and passed Williams also and then he commenced walking slowly and Williams passed him—they might have spoken to each other then but I was about 200 yards behind and could not hear—before we came to Cambridge Heath Bridge both of them went together they could not see me then there were a few persons coming home from the City and I got among them—they joined together—Wells still carried the parcel of goods and walked on to the bridge where I met a constable he and I followed them till we met another constable a few yards past the Hackney-road-gate and I gave them in charge HENRY STEED I am shopboy to Messrs Dennis In consequence of an order given to me by James I followed Wells—James pointed him out to me before he left—I saw him meet Williams as he was passing under the Hackney railway arch and against St Thomas s-square I saw Wells pass some-thing over into Williams s hand—I was not near enough to see what it was—they then separated they were only together two or three minutes—I came back and told Mr James—I went out again afterwards and saw them both at the corner of Well-street and another one with them—I followed them till we met a constable FREDERICK COWAN policeman N 77 On 4th July between 8 and 9 o clock in the evening I was on duty at Cambridge Heath Bridge and in consequence of information from James I followed the two prisoners to Cambridge Heath Gate—I there met All wood another constable and I took Wells in charge and he took Williams—after we had got some little distance I told Wells that he was charged with uttering a forged 5l note—I asked him what he was doing with Williams—he said at first he did not know anything of him he said he was going to his Williams s master to get change for the note—he did not mention the name of Williams s master—I took him to the station and there the parcel that he had was examined it contained grocery and pic nic biscuits—these are the things—I searched Wells and found on him 5l in gold 15s 4d in silver and 2d in copper——I asked him about the note—he said Williams had token the note back and given him his money—Williams claimed the grocery at the station and Wells claimed the biscuits—I asked Wells his address and I believe he said he lived in Church-street Stepney but I will not be certain—inquiries were made at the address he gave I went with Allwood to make them—we went to High-street Stepney—I believe that was the address he gave I could find no such person as Wells there Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Did you go to No 21 A We did not there was no No 21 in the street—I am sure of that—I cannot tell what was the highest number in the street—Allwood had been there the night before—I say there was no No 21 from what Allwood told me—the street did not appear to be long enough to contain that number of houses—* I saw a person who represented herself to be the wife of Wells—that was in a turning by the side of Stepney Church—J do not know the name it is not High-street it turns out of High-street—I did not break open the door of the room where she was I knocked at the door and was let in—she had not just been confined—I do not know that she was on the verge of it—I was not told so by her mother JAMES JAMES re-examined These are the parcels of grocery goods that I sold to Williams and I believe these arc the pic nics I sold to Wells THOMAS ALLWOOD policeman K 422 On the evening of 4th July I apprehended Williams in the Cambridge Heath-road—I told him I wanted him to go to the station house with me—he went—as we were going he asked what I wanted him for—I said You will know when You get to the station house —I had got him by the cuff of his coat which was loose—he seemed very restless going along the road he got his hand into his left hand coat pocket and pulled out this pocket book—I saw it in his hand—he broke the elastic band took something out of it and put his right hand up to his mouth and dropped the book on my foot—I said Is that your game —he said What —I picked up the pocket book and he said to me Oh you can take me to the station house I have no forged notes about me you cannot convict me —I had not mentioned anything to him about notes or about the charge—I searched him at the station house and found 7s 10d in silver and 3d in coppers upon him—I examined the pocket book but found nothing Williams Q Did you pick the pocket book up or did any one give it to you A I stooped down and picked it up—a boy did not give it to me—I cannot positively say whether you have got on the same dress now that you had then the coat looks very much like it it was a kind of shooting coat with pockets outside JOSEPH BUMSTEAD re-examined I have looked at all the seven notes produced—they are all forgeries and all from the same plate Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Is the signature of H Back to these notes a right signature supposing they were genuine notes might they have that signature A Yes there is a cashier of that name—there has been a new issue of notes of that kind with his name MR CLARKSON Q Do you mean in this year A Yes I am quite sure of that of 5l notes MR PARRY Q You are quite sure that H Back has signed Bank notes of this year A Yes not of the new issue—there is such a person as H Back who has signed Bank note—I am not quite sure whether his signature might appear to these notes if genuine—I rather* think it might but I am not positive—by the new issue I mean a note that was brought out a short time back MR CLARKSON Q When was the new issue A About two years or eighteen months back there was a new issue on 1st Jan last—Mr Back might not have signed those—he had not authority to do so—the course has been entirely changed since 1st Jan 1855—before that Mr Back and other cashiers signed 5l notes—since that period Mr Back has not signed any 5l notes—I know that and say so positively The prisoner Williams in a long defence stated that he arrived in England on 13th May last in the William Brown from Sidney that he brought with him a quantity of gold and money that with several shipmates he went to board with a man in Wellclose-square who introduced him to a person to dispose of his gold that he sold to that person fifty ounces and a half of gold at 3l 17s 6dan ounce and received from him twenty-four 5lnotes three 10lnotes and 52 sovereigns that he soon spent the sovereign and then proceeded to spend the notes purchasing such things as were useful on board ship he stated that Wells was a perfect stranger to him until he came into the shop of Messrs Dennis on 4th July when he cashed the note for him that on leaving the shop he followed him and asked his address to which he replied that being a sailor he had no address that Wells then wished him to change the note again which he could not do unless he also took the goods he had that he did so and on receiving the note back from him he tore it up and threw it away WELLS— GUILTY Aged 36 — Transported for Twenty Years WILLIAMS— GUILTY Williams was further charged with having been before convicted JOHN YOUNG I am a turnkey at Warwick jail I produce a certificate This certified the conviction of John Twitty at the Quarter Sessions Birmingham on 21st Oct of housebreaking after previous conviction and that he was sentenced to fifteen years transportation —I was present at that trial—the prisoner Williams is the person to whom this certificate refers WILLIAMS— GUILTY Aged 44 —

t18551022-943  943 EDWARD AGAR feloniously forging and uttering an order for the payment of 700l with intend to defraud MESSRS BODKIN PARRY and SLEIGH conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM SMITH I am by trade a carpenter and cabinet maker I know person named Humphries he lives at No 19 King s-road Theobald s-road—in May last I was working for him—I was working for him about a fortnight or three weeks in May and from eight to ten weeks altogether on and off—I was not there every day—I know the prisoner I knew him by the name of Jenkins—he came to see Mr Humphries—he and Humphries appeared to be dn friendly terms—I think it was about the beginning or middle of June that Agar first came while I was there—he entered into conversation with me—I was in the East Indies when I was young at Calcutta—Agar remarked my arms being marked with Indian ink what is called tattooing—he asked me what parts I had been to—I told him to Calcutta St Helena and the Cape of Good Hope—he told me be had been to America and the West Indies but never to the East—after that he used to talk to me when he came about the war or anything—he used to come at least three or four times a week—sometimes he remained an hour and sometimes two or three hours and sometimes the major part of the day—Mr Humphries used to he a great deal out and he used to stay many times in the front office and enter into conversation with me—he did not distinctly tell me that he had business with Humphries but I have heard him speak to Humphries about some leasehold property—one evening in June he asked me to take a small box for him to Pickford s booking office in Oxford-street opposite Newman-street—when I got there I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the way—he had not said anything about my meeting him there I did not expect to see him—about a week after that I was in Mr Humphries s office making a drawing of a door that I was about fitting up I had known nothing of Agar before seeing him at Humphries s —he said to me on that occasion You seem handy with your pen old fellow would you like to leave off carpentering and get a better or an easier Bert he —I said I should and he said he would see if he could not do something for me in the course of a little time—he asked me if I could meet him that night at 8 o clock at Raymond s-buildings where I had met him before when I took the box—I did meet him—this was still in June—when I met him he asked me if I would take ten sovereigns for him to a coffee house in Orange-street that I should there see a tall stout man very dark with spectacles on that I was to ask him if he was waiting to see Mr A—and if he said yes I was to ask him what he was waiting to receive and if he said 10l I was to give him the ten sovereigns—I went there and saw a person exactly like the one he described and gave him the money—I did not stop there two minutes—I then went to meet the prisoner at Tom s Coffee-house Holborn nearly opposite Day and Martin s—he had appointed to meet me there on my return from Orange-street—I told him that I had seen his friend and given him the money and it was all right—he then gave me a sovereign and gave me a small parcel to take charge of for him—he told me to take particular care of it and asked me where I lived in case he should want it in a hurry—it was a small parcel about four inches wide eight or nine inches long and about half an inch thick—it was a very heavy parcel I never knew the contents of it—I told him I lived at No 36 Blenheim-street Chelsea—he said Why don t you get apartments in town —I said I thought I should do so shortly—the parcel remained in my possession something less than a fortnight I had seen Agar in the meantime at Humphries s —at the expiration of ten days or a fortnight he asked if I would meet him the following morning and bring the parcel with me—I met him at the Black Horse in Coventry-street Haymarket the next morning and gave him the parcel—he asked me to meet him again the following evening at the same house—I did so and he then gave me another parcel—he told me to take particular care of it—that parcel was never opened until after his apprehension I kept it until then—about the middle of July he asked me if I had ever transacted business at a banker s—I told him I had repeatedly—he said he should want me to do a little for him some time—I believe that was all he said about it at that time—this was as we were walking from the Black Horse towards Oxenden-street—on 4th Aug I moved from Blenheim-street to No 61 Theobald s-road—on that day I met the prisoner by accident in Southampton-row—he spoke of the current things of the day and then I think he said Can you meet me on Monday night —this was on Saturday I believe—I told him that I had moved to Theobald s-road that day or that I was going to do so—he said he wanted me to take a cheque for him to get the money—I do not know whether he mentioned the amount of the cheque that day or on Monday—before this he asked me if I should like to earn 100l —I cannot positively say whether that was said on the Saturday or the Monday but I believe it was on the Saturday—I said I should and asked him what it was to do—he said it was a matter where there was some little risk to run but if I minded his instructions no harm could come of it—he then told me it was to present a cheque at a banker s for payment—I do not think he told me the name of the bank then—he said Take the cheque and present it in the usual way —he did not produce the cheque to me then—he said If they ask you any questions you may judge then that it is wrong they will most likely take you round to the manager s room and ask you who you brought it from —and I was to say from Captain Pellatt of the Euston Hotel and if they asked me if I was his servant I was to say No a gentlemen as I was passing the Euston Hotel asked me if I would take a note to Mivart s Hotel to Captain Fitzgerald to hurry there and back and merely give it to the porter —I was to say that on my return to the Euston Hotel the gentleman asked me many questions as to my character and that he then asked me if I would take a cheque to the banker s and get change for it and that I consented to do so—that was the story I was to toll if I was taken into the manager s room and asked questions—I think that was all that was said on that occasion—nothing was given to me at that interview—these conversations occurred so frequently that I can scarcely say upon which day the separate conversations were—I met him on the Monday at Tom s Coffee-house—he said to me on the Saturday As now you have got up to this end of the town can you look in at Tom s Coffee-house every night at 7 o clock and if I am there I shall see you and I will follow you out —I met him there on the Monday and Tuesday outside the coffee house—it was on those occasions that the conversation I have related passed—I could not pledge myself as to any particular day—on Tuesday 7th he appointed me to meet him at about half-past 3 o clock on the following Saturday outside the coffee-house in King-street Holborn—I was to walk up and down there until he came—I did meet him there between 4 and 5 o clock—I walked up and down the street until he came—he then asked me if I thoroughly understood what I had got to do and asked me to repeat to him what his instructions were—I did so as well as I could and he said You ll do —he then said Take this cheque —he produced it at that time and also gave me a canvas bag and a half-sovereign—he said the cheque was dated for the following Wednesday and he told me to go on the Wednesday and I was to take a cab or walk to Sey-mour-street Euston-square first I was to get a sheet of blank paper and an envelope and address it to Captain Fitzgerald at Mivart s Hotel to take a cab from Sey-mour-street and drive to Mivart s Hotel and leave the note and then drive back to the Euston Hotel—I was then to go on to the bank with the cheque and get a glass of ale on the road so that the change of the half-sovereign and the cab hire and the price of the ale should correspond with my statement—he said Take the cheque and present it in the usual way if they ask you how you will have it say 10 fifties and 200l in gold and if you get the money all right come back to me in Southampton-row Bedford-square or Russell-square I will be walking about there —he said if I saw him I was to take no notice of him but give him the money and meet him next morning at 11 o clock at Tom s Coffee-house and he would give me the 100l in gold but if I was detected he should not expect me after 6 o clock he should not wait after 6 o clock he should then watch the morning papers and he said they could not do anything to me if I kept to that statement—he then gave me the cheque—after this I made a communication to Mr Mullens I believe on Monday the 13th—Mr Mullens gave me certain directions which I followed—On Wednesday 15th Aug I walked up to Eaton-square and inquired at the hotel if Mr Pellatt was there—the waiter said she believed he had slept there last night but he was not there then—I then took a cab from there and drove to Mivart s Hotel in Brook-street and left a letter there—I then drove back again to the Euston Hotel and paid the cabman—I then walked towards Lombard-street—I had a glass of ale on the road and some dinner and then I rode outside an omnibus to the bank—I changed the half-sovereign for the cab hire and paid for my dinner out of the change—I got on to the omnibus in New Oxford-street and got to the bank a little after 3 o clock—I went to Stevenson and Salt s banking-house in Lombard-street and presented the cheque—I gave the canvas bag which the prisoner had given me and something was put into it by one of the clerks I did not know what it was I did not see it—I saw Mr Mullens there—the bag was given back to me tied up I took it in my hand outside the bank door—I was instructed to do so by Mr Mullens—when I got outside the bank I put it in my breast pocket—I walked direct down the Poultry and Cheapside and up Holborn and to Southampton-row—I got there about 4 o clock and walked about there for some time—I walked from there towards New North-street and had a glass of ale at a public-house—I walked from there to Bedford-row and was standing there some little time when the prisoner came up to me at the corner of Bedford-row and Theo-bald s-road —he came up to me shook hands and asked me if I had got it all right—I said Yes —he looked across the road and said Who are those two fellows over the way —I said I did not know he looked round again and said They are following us walk this way towards Holborn —he then said Sling me the stuff and then I will run for it —I gave him the bag—before I gave him the bag he said to me How b——y careless you were in putting the bag in your pocket at the bank in Lombard-street —I do not recollect that he said anything further—he said that I believe as we turned down Eagle-street or one of the little streets from Bedford-row—it was after he said Sling me the stuff and I will run for it —I gave him the bag soon after I could not at the moment because the men were behind watching us but as soon as an opportunity offered I gave it him and he ran away as fast as he could—he told me to go into a baker s shop and he would run to the fields meaning Lincoln s Inn fields—he pointed to a baker s shop at the corner so that I should not run the same way as he did—I saw him again in five or six minutes in custody of Thorogood and Goddard—I was also taken into custody by the officers and we were handcuffed together—while we were at the Mansion House handcuffed together he said to me It was your fault that I was taken through running the same way as I did but if you stick to me if it costs me a thousand pounds I will get you out of it —this was not said loud enough to be heard—we both sat on chairs together—it was before the handcuffs were taken off Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q How came they to be so unkind as to handcuff you A I believe it was their instructions—it did not surprise me—I had been acting as a friend of the public and of society—I could not help being handcuffed—I believe it was part of the trick—I was not aware that I was to be handcuffed the officers thought it was necessary that I should be—I was not altogether innocent all through this transaction—possibly what transactions I have done have not been altogether honest—I was not joining in this transaction with a view to commit a forgery I was acting innocently from the beginning to the end—I swear that—I never intended to present the cheque—I went to Mr Mullens on the 13th—the conversation on the 4th was a queer conversation—I began to suspect then that Agar was not so honest a man as he ought to be—I did not make a communication to anybody on the 4th nor on the 5th nor I think on the 6th—I do not know why I did not—there was no offence committed—I thought what was spoken of I was not bound to tell everybody of at the time—I did speak of it about the 7th or 8th to Mr Roe on one of those days he is a hair-dresser—I do not know whether I told Mr Mullens that I had told Roe—I have told him so—I do not know whether Roe is here—I have not seen him this morning—I believe he is to be a witness—I also told Mr Humphries on the next day I think after telling Roe on the Wednesday the 8th—I have not seen Humphries here—I do not know whether he is to be a witness—I told Mr Mullens that I had told Humphries—I was advised to go to Mr Mullens by Humphries and from that time I acted as an agent of the police for the purpose of getting Agar taken into custody Humphries told me that Mr Mullens was the attorney to the bankers and that he was the proper solicitor for anything of that kind—Humphries at once lent himself to the discovery and did all he could to suggest the means of discovery—he did not behave as if he were a very intimate friend of Agar s—I am a cabinet-maker by business but I do carpentering as well—I am a master cabinet-maker—I do not at present carry on business at any place—I gave my address as King s-place—I gave it as King-street at first but I corrected it afterwards—I should have said King s-place—it is in Pall Mall—I did live there three years back—it was what is generally termed a lodging-house—they are let as lodging-houses houses of assignation—it was not a brothel—I believe there is a distinction between the two—if parties came there to hire a room to stop for any period I never asked them their business—the question was never put whether they wanted to stop a night or a week—if any persons wanted to occupy a room they could do so by paying for it—there were no women kept in the house—that is no women for the purpose you imagine—I believe men and women could come and hire a room there for the purposes of fornication whenever they pleased—I never let a room myself—I derived a little of my livelihood from it—I was living there and keeping the house with my wife—I was not gaining a livelihood by that I was still at work at my own business—I did not leave my wife to manage the house—my servants did—she was never seen in it—she did not attend to the door—I kept that house about two years it might be three—I have been an eating-house-keeper at St George s-street in the East—that is since that—I have been nothing else except my own business of a cabinet-maker—I have never been in this Court before—I have been in the Old Bailey before tried as a prisoner but I do not know in which Court—that is between eleven and twelve years ago—I was then eighteen years of age—it was for baying a watch receiving a stolen watch—it was only one article—I was convicted and had twelve months—that was the only time—I am quite sure of that—I am not sure whether it was in 1849 or 1850 that I began to keep the house of assignation—I was tried here in my own name—I kept the brothel in my own name—I have always gone by that name never by any other name not for one day—I swear that—I do not know whether Humphries is a married man—there was a woman who passed as Mrs Humphries—her name is Emily Campbell—I never did messages for her—I have gone out for spirits for her—I have not acted as servant at Humphries s house but if I was asked to go on an errand I did not hesitate to do so and I have occasionally acted as clerk to Humphries when he has been out—he is a house agent and auctioneer—whenever I was there at work at carpentering and he has said Smith would you mind the office for to-day I have done so and taken any names that came—I never knew him to act as an attorney the only affair I knew of was when you had him at Bagnigge-wells for an assault or some such case—I read of that and I know of nothing more—I have known him to be engaged in collecting debts—he did not help me through the Insolvent Court—I have passed through the Insolvent Court in 1854—I never saw Humphries about that matter to my knowledge—I do not know whether he is to be a witness I have never heard—he had nothing whatever to do with getting me through the Insolvent Court—I did not know him at that time—he has never been concerned in preparing a bill of sale for me—I have not been very intimate with him—I have dined with him at the same table with him and Emily Campbell—I do not know that the prisoner ran off with Emily Campbell—I swear that—I have heard it—I only know that the prisoner was living with her in the name of Adams from the evidence of the servant at the Mansion House and from what Thorogood has told me—Humphries never spoke to me about it and never alluded to it at all—Emily Campbell was not there at the time I made the communication to Humphries—I do not know that she was with the prisoner—she told me that she was away with her mother ill—she was not with Humphries—I do not know whether she is with him now—I swear that—I have not seen her with Humphries—I do not know whether she is there or not—I saw her last I should say nearly three months ago about a fortnight before this case first came on—I may have dined with Humphries four or five times—I was tolerably intimate with him when I was there I had a long distance to go home and he generally made me have a bit with him—beyond that there has been no transaction between us—I swear that—I was not engaged in the transaction at Bagnigge-wells—I read of it and was at one of the examinations and on one of the occasions I dined with Humphries—I believe it was about breaking into a house in Ormond-street to get away a child—I believe it was on the second examination that I dined with him—I am not sure whether it was the second or third examination—I was never in the house in Ormond-street—I am not the person who represented a Roman Catholic clergyman and called himself Scholfield—I never called myself the Rev Dr Scholfield for the purpose of getting into the house in Ormond-street—I was not supplied by Humphries with a broad brimmed hat nor had I my face blackened for the purpose of not being seen—the whole of it is a fable as far as I am concerned—I have heard of it before because I was at the examination—I never had anything at all to do with it—I had not the curiosity to see what the first parcel contained which the prisoner gave me to take care of—I have no idea what it was—I gave the second parcel up to Forrester—it turned out to contain several forged plates—I have no idea why the prisoner should have trusted me with it—he gave me no reason no more than I was to take care of it for him—I have never seen the forged plates except when they were exposed at the Mansion House—I did not look at them—I had not shown them to Humphries or Mr Mullens—I told Mr Mullens that I had a parcel and I told Humphries—he did not ask to see it—he asked me what it was like—Mr Mullens did not ask to see it—I rather think 1 told him about it on Monday 13th but I could not be positive—he did not ask to see it—nobody ever saw it until I gave it up to the officer—I had on previous occasions presented cheques and received money for them—that was all in an honest way—I do not know a Mr Sid serf—I know a man named Sidd his name may be Sid serf—they call him Said—I do not know that his name is Sid serf—I have not heard him called Sid serf—I do not know whether Sidd and Sid serf are the same person—I have repeatedly spoken to Sidd at Humphries s—I used to call him Mr Sidd not Sidd—I have known him dine there once and only once—I do not know what he is—I have been a good deal with him lately—I have not been about the Court with him—I was not with him to-day nor yesterday—I saw him yesterday but not here—I do not know anything about him—I saw him yesterday in one of the streets leading out of Gray s Inn-lane—I met him by accident not by appointment—he and I have never had any talk on the subject of forged plates—I never learnt from him anything about his habits or what his business was I have always believed him to be a solicitor—I have seen him write at Humphriea s desk repeatedly—I believe him to be a solicitor from the style of his writing—I have never met Sidd here upon a former occasion I never saw him here—I do not expect anything for this matter more than my time to be paid for I suppose—I have never said that I expected to get 100l or that I would not take 100l for my share not to anybody—I am quite sure about that—I have seen a good deal of Roe since I made the communication to him—I saw him yesterday—I have told Roe that if I did not give Agar into custody that Agar would transport me—I cannot say the exact words I said—I said that Agar s object was no doubt to transport me but he should not have the chance—I meant by his using me as a tool in the matter—I should judge that was his object—I only give my own opinion—I do not know that I am right—I cannot recollect exactly what it was I said or when it was I kept no memorandum it may have been three months ago no not so long two months—it was since Agar has been in custody—I said this that in the event of anything occurring if I was taken for arrears of rent or anything and these things had been found in my place no doubt I should have been transported for the possession of them—I meant the forged plates—I have not had any money or clothes from Humphries since this matter has been going on no more than what he owed me—I think he owed me about 2l 12s I have had that in two or three different instalments at one time he gave me I think 1l at another time 30s and the third time half-a-crown I think that was how I received it—I have not had any clothes from him—I have not been concerned in any matter connected with a will with a person named Wisheo—I know Wychelo—I know something of a will under which Wychelo claims—I do not know that it is said to be forged—Humphries is also a claimant on behalf of Miss Campbell—I believe he was appointed executor to the last will MR PAARY Q Is that all You know about this will A That it all—at the time I was in arrear of rent I had the parcel in my possession that was afterwards opened at the Mansion House—it is twelve years ago since I was convicted about the watch—there was a fight at a public-house between two men and the watch was laid on the mantelpiece the waiter got possessed of it and showed it to me and wanted me to boy it I gave him 4l for it—he owed me 2l and I gave him 2l more—I have presented cheques in the way of business at banking houses—the 2l 12s which I had from Humphries was for carpentering work that I had done for him JOHN DEVERRLL Esq I am a magistrate of the county of Hampshire and reside at Purbrook-park in that county I have kept an account with Messrs Stevenson and Salt for the last thirty years—this cheque is not my writing nor signed by my authority but it is a very fearful representation of it—I think it has been done by tracing paper against a window—there is a tremulousness about the hand—I never signed a cheque for 700l or authorised it—the transaction is a false one as well as the signature—I have not the slightest idea how the prisoner could have got at my signature RICHARD MULLENS I am solicitor to the associated bankers of the City of London and conduct this prosecution I first knew the witness Smith on Monday 13th Aug —he made some communication to me upon which 1 gave him instructions how to act—on the following Wednesday the 15th I attended at the banking house of Stevenson and Salt in Lombard-street—I gave instructions to Forrester and Goddard and two officers were placed in Glyn s banking house just opposite—about a quarter to 3 o clock I noticed a man standing on the pavement opposite Stevenson s bank smoking a cigar—he was under my observation altogether nearly a quarter of an hour—I was looking through the window blind of the bank—just about 3 o clock a cab drove up very fast and pulled up all at once exactly opposite Stevenson s window where the man was—the person in the cab put out his hand and beckoned to him there was only one person in the cab and they spoke together very earnestly for a very short time the man in the cab then got out just said a word to the other man and went away and I saw no more of him—I observed the countenance of the man who was in the cab—I noticed him sufficiently to be able to form a belief as to who he was—I believe the prisoner to be the man—I wag just the width of the pavement from him—I was sitting at the window of the bank and the cab drove up immediately to the window on the same side—he got out of the cab on that side—I believe it to be the prisoner—I saw him again that same evening at the station-house—he was dressed much as he is now I think but not in a coat of that colour I did not see much of his dress because all the time he was speaking out of the window of the cab—I saw him get out but he was away in an instant—all the conversation was while he was in the cab I could only see his face not his figure—when he got out he walked quickly away—my impression is that it was a dark coat not exactly a frock coat it was cut away at the corners I think it is called an Oxonian but I would not undertake to say anything about it—I saw him again that same evening but I have no idea how he was dressed then I took no notice—from seven to ten minutes afterwards Smith came into the banking house—the man with the cigar remained—he was walking up and down before the banking house in Abchurch-lane until Smith came—the cab went away empty—the man who got out of it went away before the cab man could get on his box again he went so quickly—Smith came in and presented the cheque for 700l —he brought this canvas bag with him—I put into the bag 200 farthings and some marked pieces of paper and tied up the bag—I had not arranged with any one what should be done—Smith did not know—I delivered the bag to Smith and he carried it away—I gave him some directions as to putting it into his pocket as he went out—he carried the bag in his hand until he got outside the door and I saw him stand on the pavement and put it into his breast pocket—any person standing about would have an opportunity of seeing him Cross-examined Q Were you before the Magistrate in any capacity A I conducted the prosecution as the attorney—I made no opening of the case I examined the witnesses—I was not examined—I did not think it judicious to call myself while the other man was at large—I had at that time learned who that man was who was smoking the cigar—I thought it would have been injudicious to have been called at that time although I affirm that it was the prisoner whom I saw—I am not aware that he had any conception of that fact until to-day—I gave notice to Mr Wontner s clerk that I should be examined but not as to what yes I did tell him about the man with the cigar—I did not tell him anything about the prisoner—in the progress of this case Mr Humphries has been to me when I have sent for him—I have seen him several times perhaps a dozen times more or less—I have seen him when I have thought it necessary to send for him—I do not know a person called Sidd or Sid serf—I have heard of such a man—he is not a forger to my knowledge or a coiner nothing of the kind—I never knew him to be convicted nothing of the kind—it is a totally different matter in which I have heard his name nothing whatever connected with the Bankers Association ELIZA BAILEY I now reside at No 7 Little Ogle-street Marylebone Up to the beginning of Aug I was in the service of Mr Humphries at No 19 King s-road Gray s-inn—I think I was there three weeks or a month—during that time I frequently saw the witness Smith there at work —I also saw the prisoner there frequently—sometimes two or times in a day—he has asked for Mr Smith when he has called was he there had he been there or whether I knew if he was coming—I knew the prisoner by the name of Jenkins—I have seen him and Smith in conversation together at various times and have seen them drink together and have meals together Cross-examined Q When did you leave Humphries s service in Aug A Yes—I was there I think three weeks or a month—he had a person living with him who was his housekeeper—she was my mistress—I do not know her name and there was a lodger up stairs—some called my mistress Mrs Humphries—they used to call her that because they took her to be the housekeeper—I called her Mrs Humphries—I think her name is Campbell—I never interfered with their affairs it was nothing to me—I know Smith well—my father used to work for him some years ago—I have sometimes seen him with Humphries I might have done so very often—I do not know whether they have been together a long time—I do not know that they have been together for two or three hours at a time I never saw them they might have been so but I never stopped—I opened the door to him and then left him—he was doing the door when I left—I have not seen him and Humphries a good deal together I have seen them together—I think they have dined together—I have waited at table when they have dined together—he was working for Mr Humphries doing the door—I have seen him as much with Mr Jenkins—I was not before the Magistrate HENRY GODDARD I was for many years an officer attached to Bow-street office I have retired I was engaged by Mr Mullens to assist in the detection of this affair—on 15th Aug I went to Glyn s banking house in Lombard-street which faces Messrs Stevenson s—I saw Smith go in and come out—before that I saw a man standing about five or six yards off leaning against the side of the building—he was doing nothing but merely looking towards the banking house—the fact is there were two men—I observed one standing by the banking house for some time looking towards the entrance and shortly after I had observed him I saw another man—whether he got out of the cab or not I do not know but I saw a man standing opposite the door smoking a cigar—I have seen that man since and have heard his name to be Pearce—I have endeavoured to take him into custody on this charge—I have not been able to trace him at all not beyond his place of residence at Kilburn—I saw Smith come out of the banking house he remained a few seconds outside the door and put a canvas bag something similar to this into his side coat pocket—Thorogood a nephew of Forrester s was with me—I cannot say that I observed the man with the cigar at the time Smith came out because my attention was then directed to Smith—Thorogood and I followed Smith to the neighbourhood of Bos-well-court and Theobald s-road—I saw him at last in Bedford-row—after being there some time he was joined by the prisoner COURT Q Had he been joined by anybody before A Smith was in a public house by Boswell-court and a person of the name of Humphries I understand came in there—I saw him there—he was in there about six or seven minutes MR BODKIN Q What part of the house did Smith go into A First into the bar and then into the parlour—I was in the house and went into the parlour also—he and Humphries were together in the public house about five minutes—Thorogood was there also—we were all close together in the parlour—we were not sitting we were standing—I heard what they said—I heard Humphries say to Smith He will not be here meaning as I understood at the time the prisoner—he said He will not be here now he will be at my office at 5 o clock —I do not know whether Smith made any answer—I am not aware that he did I cannot recollect—this was said by Humphries openly so as to be heard by me and Thorogood—Humphries then left the house and Smith went out afterwards and I after Smith—I saw what became of Smith until he joined the prisoner at the corner of Bedford-row—he did not join Humphries afterwards—Smith was walking up and down at the end of Bedford-row and the prisoner came and joined him and they shook hands—they remained in conversation for a very short time and walked together up Bedford-row and turned the corner of a street leading into Red Lion-square—the prisoner looked back—they walked on to Red Lion-square and crossed Red Lion-square the prisoner occasionally looking back down Leigh-street into Eagle-street and then into Kingsgate-street where I lost sight of them for a few seconds—when I turned the corner of Kingsgate-street I saw Smith and he waved his hand and said That way that way down Turnstile —I went on down Turnstile Thoro-good was on before me—I pursued down Gate-street into Great Queen-street and saw the prisoner being led out of Parker-street into Queen-street by Thorogood—I did not see him taken Thorogood was on before me—he and I had raised the cry of Stop thief in Queen-street—I took him into a shop there and as I was leading him into the shop Thorogood turned back and brought Smith in—I directed that they should be handcuffed together—the prisoner asked me what it was for and said he would go quietly—I told him it was for uttering a forged cheque at the banking house in Lombard-street—I said This young man pointing to Smith has been followed from the bankers where he has uttered a forged cheque have you received anything from him —he immediately put his hand into his pocket and gave me this canvas bag—I said From whom did you receive this —he said He gave it me pointing to Smith—that was all he said—I then took him to the Mansion House—they were together there in a room—there was no examination then it was after hours—I observed that they spoke to each other I did not hear what they said—I was at the Mansion House at the first examination—Smith was then examined as a witness—after the examination was over the prisoner said in the room that he was as innocent as the child unborn that he was like an innocent man going to the slaughter that he was innocent of this case—he said he had not knownn Smith he never had more than a dozen words with him in his life—on the same evening that the prisoner was taken into custody the 15th I went to Smith s lodging in Theobald s-road—I saw a parcel taken from a little box there—Smith gave it to Forrester—Smith was not committed at all—on 4th Sept I was with Thorogood in Union-street Black-friars—we followed a man who came out of a public house there—it was the man that I saw smoking the cigar in Lombard-street the man they call Pearce—he went to Mr Wontner s office in Snow-hill—there had been two examinations previous to that—I think the prisoner was not then committed—Mr Wontner had acted as his attorney—I was there I heard him put questions to Smith in cross-examination—some time after Pearce had gone into Mr Wontner s office I and Forrester went in—I waited at the door—I did not see Pearce come out in fact I went away to fetch Forrester from the Mansion House leaving Thorogood on the spot—when Forrester came he went in and I went in with him—Mr Wontner was there—some inquiry was made—I have never seen the man since Cross-examined Q You were a long time before you recollected about the prisoner saying he had not exchanged a dozen words with Smith in his life A I was—it is not mentioned in my deposition—this is the first time the prisoner has had the opportunity of hearing it from me—I have no recollection of his saying it was a plant put upon him by Humphries—I did not hear him say so or anything to that effect—I do not recollect his saying anything of the sort not to me—I do not recollect his making use of the word plant—he said he fancied there was some woman at the bottom of it—he said that Humphries wanted to cheat him out of 200l odd that he owed him—I heard him say that he was going to receive 200 sovereigns but I did not understand from whom and he thought that the money he gave me was that money COURT Q Was that after the bag had been opened and found to contain 200 farthings A Yet some time afterwards—I think he said it before that—it was before the examination—he said he thought it was the 200 sovereigns he was going to receive JONATHAN THOROGOOD I am not an officer—I am nephew to John and Daniel Forrester the Mansion House officers—I was employed in this case—on Wednesday 15th Aug about a quarter to 3 o clock I went to Lombard-street in company with Goddard—I went into Glyn s banking house to watch Stevenson and Salt s house—I saw Smith and I saw a man standing outside Stevenson and Salt s whose name I have since ascertained to be Pearce—I saw him standing there and also walking up and down and smoking a cigar—I saw Smith go into Stevenson s—the man was not there then—I watched Stevenson s house and saw Smith come out with a bag in his hand—he stood on the pavement opposite the door of the banking house put the bag into his breast coat pocket buttoned his coat up and walked away—I saw a cab opposite the banking house—I saw the cab before the man was walking up and down—the man and the cab were there at the same time—I did not see the man get out of the cab—I saw the man with the cigar in his mouth walking up and down by the cab—he was not there when the cab drove up—he was there while the cab was there—he was not walking there before the cab came up—he was walking up and down there whilst the cab was standing there—I did not see him until just after the cab came up—I was put there to watch for a party going into Stevenson and Salt s banking house—I followed Smith with Goddard until he came to Bedford-row—I saw him go into a public house as he went along at the corner of Boswell-court—at that time he had the bag in his breast pocket—I went into that public house—I afterwards followed him to Bedford-row and there saw the prisoner meet him—he came from up John-street I believe—they shook hands with each other—I saw them talking together I should think between three and five minutes—they then walked up John-street together talking—they walked up several turnings through Red Lion-square till they came into Kingsgate-street Holborn—when I turned into Kingsgate-street I missed the prisoner—I ran up and spoke to Smith—I ran across Holborn down New Turnstile into Gate-street Great Queen-street Little Queen-street into Parker-street—I saw the prisoner running during this time not the whole of the time but from time to time—I am sure it was the same person that I had seen with Smith—I called out Stop thief —I am not aware that that was cried by anybody else except myself—the prisoner heard it and turned back and looked at me several times—several persons attempted to stop him—when I was turning into Parker-street he was walking towards me with his hat off—I laid hold of him—he said You have made a mistake down that way down that way pointing with his finger I have done nothing —I said Come on you will hear presently —Goddard then came up and he was taken into a shop in Little Queen-street—I went out of the shop and took Smith—he was amongst the crowd in Little Queen-street—he had followed Goddard—Smith and the prisoner were then handcuffed together—the prisoner said to Goddard I have done nothing what is it —Goddard said The fact is this young man pointing to Smith has been watched from the banking house in Lombard-street and you have received something from him what have you done with it —the prisoner put his hand in his breast coat pocket took out this bag and gave it to Goddard—Goddard said From whom did you receive this —the prisoner pointed with his finger to Smith—Forrester then came up he was in the neighbourhood and they were taken to the Mansion House—at the Mansion House I saw them talking together but I was not able to hear what they said—I know the house No 7 Stanley-place Paddington—on 18th Aug I watched that house and about 7 o clock in the evening I saw the same man that I had seen smoking outside the banking house in Lombard-street come to that house with another man a Jew looking man—on 4th Sept I was at Kilburn and saw the same two men at the Red Lion there—I followed that man as far as Mr Wontner s office in Skinner-street—I have never seen him since—I have endeavoured to find him Cross-examined Q You say you followed Smith into a public house A I did at the corner of Boswell-court—Humphries came in afterwards and they had a chat together—I heard what they said—when Humphries came in he said Oh here you are and he laid hold of Smith s arm and said Come this way and took him into the parlour—I followed them in—Humphries said Have you got it and Smith said Yes touching his pocket—Humphries said Pull it out and let us see it —Smith did not attempt to pull it out—I stopped their conversation immediately—I said No not in my presence for if you take it I shall take you into custody my instructions are to take the first man that Smith gives the bag to JOHN FORRESTER I am an officer of the City On 15th August I took the prisoner into custody at a shop in Little Queen-street Lincoln s Inn Fields—I told him he was taken for a forgery—Goddard was there at the time and I think he had told him previously what it was for—the bag was handed to me by Goddard—the prisoner and Smith were then taken to the Mansion House—I searched him there—I found on him several keys amongst them a street door key which I afterwards found fitted the door of No 7 Stanley-place Paddington—on the evening of 15th August I went to Smith s lodging and in Goddard s presence took possession of this parcel produced —it was under a table I think in a box and he pulled it out and gave it to me—it was tied up very tight—it contains some engraved plates for cheques of five different bankers two of Robarts and Curtis one of Ransom s one of Glyn s and one of a Banking Company at Jersey—there are also thirteen pieces of paper counterfoils of printed cheques four blank cheques of Hill and Sons and two of Lacey and Sons

cheques and some types Cross-examined Q Did you find any memorandum on the prisoner connected with money matters between him and Humphries A No I have a book here which has the name of Humphries in it—that was taken from a portmanteau at the prisoner s lodging—I found that Emily Campbell was living at the prisoner s lodging—they were living together under the name of Mr and Mrs Adams ELIZABETH SCURRY I am servant to Mrs Hurst of No 7 Stanley-place Paddington—in August last the prisoner lodged there—he passed by the name of Mr Adams—about 18th or 20th August I gave a portmanteau to Forrester—the night before that a person made application for it and I refused to give it up—I gave it to Forrester on the Saturday morning Cross-examined Q Do you know what has became of Mrs Adams A No I do not—she has left the house MR BODKIN proposed to adduce evidence for the purpose of showing that forged cheques impressions from the plates found at the witness Smith s lodging and stated to be given him by the prisoner had been successfully used on other occasions MR BALLANTINE did not object but MR BARON ALDERSON was of opinion that it was not admissible as it had no tendency to confirm the evidence of Smith upon whose testimony the cam entirely depended ROBERT ALEXANDER TILCOOK City policeman 61 The prisoner was brought to Bow-lane station—I asked him his name and address which he refused to give—he said he was a tailor by business The cheque for 700l was dated August 15th 1865 drawn by John Deverell on Messrs Stevenson and Salt payable to W Pellatt Esq or bearer GUILTY Aged 30

had been stopping at his house for six weeks—the sailor s name was John Grant on board the Elizabeth lying in the London Docks—I made inquiries the next day—I could not find a ship called the

Charlotte-row Walworth The prisoner came to my shop on 20th Oct between 8 and 9 o clock in the evening—he wanted a silver watch—I showed him some watches and he selected one which was 3l 5s —whilst he was selecting I observed a woman standing at the window and she came into the shop and produced a chain from under her shawl—she asked me if it was gold—I said it was not—the prisoner told my lady that he had been very unfortunate in his first marriage that his wife dropt the wedding ring in the church yard and his wife was either burnt to death or fell down dead—he then said he should want a ring for himself and after he had got one he wished to have a wedding ring as he was going to be married again—he then had a silver chain—he selected all these things—I papered them up and laid them on the counter—he then took out a small porte mannaie and took out what appeared to be a 5l note—he gave it me and two half crowns and a sixpence in silver—this is the note—he wrote his name on the

given me the trouble—he wished me good day and went outside the door—I should imagine he was in the shop about three quarters of an hour when he bought the wedding ring he put it on his finger —he went out of the shop and returned and asked me if I could pick him out a cheaper brooch—I picked out one at 4s 6d instead of 8s 6d —that reduced the bill to 5l 10s 6d —he offered me 5l 5s as he could not afford any more which I took—he paid me a 5l note as I supposed and 5s —he took the note from a purse of some description—I did not notice it as I was winding the watch up—I asked him his name—he said Mr Clark No 16 White Horse-lane which is very nearly opposite my house—I wrote in his presence the name and address which is on it now and my initials—he took the goods and went away—I paid the

inspectors of bank notes in the Bank of England These three notes are all counterfeits and two of them bear the same number and letter—they are forged in all respects—it is possible that the bank may issue two 5l notes of the same letter and number but not the same date—I think these are all from the same plate—they all bear the same date and the same signature COURT Q Do you put the date in at the time the other part is printed A No that is put in afterwards but these appear to have been done at the same time as the other GUILTY Aged 52— Transported for Twenty Years

when he was about to pay for the leg of mutton that he asked for change for the 5l note—he said nothing about the note till he came back the second time—I wrote this William Jenkinson on it—I noticed these other names on it before I took it—it appeared not like a new note but one that had been used before MR CLARKSON Q You wrote the name of William Jenkinson on it from what the prisoner told you A Yes—I am positive the prisoner is the man—I found two indorsements on it as if it had been in circulation MR W J PAYNE Q When you took the note did you say I see it I is backed A No I do not think I

was looking up at the names over the shop windows—I do not know whether Lockwood s is a sporting house—the doors go on a swing and when I got there I saw the prisoner close by me—before I spoke to him

at it and intimated to him that I did not like its appearance—he said that he knew it to be good as he received it from a highly respectable firm in Liverpool—that did not satisfy me—I said I should like to show it to one of the firm—I said that in pretence and went out the back way to look for a policeman—I did not find one I returned in about a quarter of an hour and the prisoner was goat—the 2l 2s 3d was there I had secured that and I had not parted with the 5l note—the prisoner left the watch I had never offered it to him—he left the duplicate behind also—I never saw him again till he

to one of the firm —the duplicate was in my possession—I sent into the warehouse for the watch and chain—he had paid the money without the watch being produced—that is the custom—when I went out of the shop the watch and the money he had paid were on the back counter not where he could touch it—I think there was a person with him at the time he pawned the watch—I did not hear what name he called the man—I do not know that his name was Dyson MR CLARKSON Q The only thing that was missing when you came back was the prisoner A Yes—Messrs Dobree and Tomlinson have been open every day since—I never saw the prisoner come to bring gold or any thing else WILLIAM THOMAS police sergeant F 17 In consequence of information I apprehended the prisoner on 20th March about 12 o clock at night in St Martin

examining the note and he took it into the inspector s room—there were seven or eight persons with the prisoner when he was taken—it was at the Coach and Horses at the corner of St Martin s-court—that is a house frequented by sporting characters—I do not know Robertson—I do not know Dyson or Fowler—I have made inquiries and could not find a person of that name—I found a firm of Hartley Brothers export merchants in the Poultry—there were some knives found on the prisoner—Mr Sheave ideitified him at Bow-street COURT Q Were there many prisoners there A Yes—he was in a room with a number of others—Mr Sheave pointed him out and said That It the man MR CLARKSON to MR SHEAVE Q Under what circumstances did you recognize him A He was brought out with several other prisoners—I picked him out from a number of others ARTHUR ROWLATT I am inspector of Bank notes These three notes are all forgeries and I should they are all from the seemed plats certainly Cross-examined Q Are they very good forgeries A No I think not—we have had much better forgeries—these are very inferior William Hope lately a provision dealer at Manchester gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 40 — Transported for Fifteen Years 
t18560407-470  470 STEPHEN STOUT was indicted for feloniously forging and uttering an acceptance to a bill of exchange for 25l with intent to defraud MR PARRY conducted the Prosecution CHARLES TIOTT JUDKINS I am a merchant and patentee of sewing machines I am also the patentee of a gas regulating machine I carry on my business at No 98 Fleet-street and have also a warehouse at Manchester About Feb 1854 the prisoner came into my service—he left At the end of July or the 1st of Aug —his duty ordinarily was to act as book keeper—about the end of July 1854 there was an exhibition or fair of some description at Plymouth—I sent one of my sewing machines to that exhibition by the prisoner—I instructed him to sell it if he could and to take orders for others—he was to stay there one week—I gave him 5l for his expenses—he returned from Plymouth about 20th July but I cannot say within a few days—I was in Manchester at the time—a Mr Dresser was looking after my affairs for me in town until my return—he was not in my employment—he was doing business for himself but as a matter of friendship he looked after my affairs as I had no one—I received this bill produced whilst I was at Manchester—it came in a letter after the prisoner had returned from Plymouth—the nice of the bill was the same as it is now with the exception of my name and these figures at the bottom—I put my name to it as drawer after I received it in Manchester—I endorsed it to the Manchester branch of the National Provincial Bank of England—the name of Cross was then on the bill as it is now—that bill was dishonored—I received communication from and made inquiries of Mr Cross—the prisoner left me at the end of July or the 1st Aug —I discharged him—I saw him several times during the succeeding three four or five weeks—the last time I saw him might have been something like a week or ten days before the bill became due—I think it may have been the fore part of Nov but I am not sure—I did not see him after this bill became due till I gave him into custody—that was on Tuesday the 18th of last month at Mr Wilcox s dancing academy in Westminster-bridge-road about 10 o clock in the evening—I had an officer with me and Mr Dresser—the prisoner spoke to me first—I simply nodded—he said You are a great stranger I was just speaking about you about an hour ago to Mr Hobbs at the Institution of Civil Engineers —I said I was sorry I had had occasion to speak about him within an hour and that I had been looking for him about eighteen months and had brought an officer to take charge of him —he replied I know nothing about it or something to that effect—the officer then stepped up and said You are given into custody by this gentleman on a charge of forgery —he requested the officer to let him go home and state to his folks where he was or that he was locked up for something he did not know what—the officer told him he could not allow it—I took this bill as a matter of course in payment for the machine sold to Mr Cross and in my settlement with the prisoner at the time I discharged him I asked him if he knew the bill to be good because he had taken it without any direct authority from me unless I had known the bill to have been good—he said it was perfectly good that the gentleman Mr Cross had a large establishment and also kept a public house there—I believe the body of the bill to be in the handwriting of the prisoner—I would not swear it but that is my belief—I cannot say that I have any belief as to the acceptance—it seems to be in a different handwriting Cross-examined by MR FRANCIS Q You say you believe the body of the bill to be in the prisoner s handwriting A I do—it is not at all like his ordinary writing—I believe it to be slightly disguised—it has something of the appearance of his ordinary writing to my mind—I have seen him write very many times—he kept my books for a long time—I arrived at that opinion after looking at the bill at the Mansion House—I had seen it before but not to pay any attention to it—my attention was not particularly called to it till then—at the time I received it it did not strike me because I really paid no attention to the writing—it was not till after the charge was made that I began to criticize it at all—it was not returned to me dishonoured it was returned to the bank—I did not see it afterwards—I do not know that I ever saw the bill from the time I paid it into the bank till it was shown to me at the Mansion House—I cannot say that I never did see it because in transacting my business with the bank I have often had bills brought to me that have been returned when I have been in to pay the amount—but I very seldom take a bill out of the bank—the banker keeps them until the end of the year or whenever I call for them—I hare several thousand pounds in that way now which hare been paid and some not—I do not know that I went to the bank to make inquiries about it when I was told it was a forgery—I made inquiries about it by letter—I did not see the bill at that time I was in London—I did not have the bill sent up to me it remained in the banker s hands and the banker delivered it at the Mansion House—I cannot tell the day I received it—it was some time between 18th July and 1st Aug —I received it in a letter from Mr Dresser I believe—I keep a bill book it is at Manchester—I have not thought it necessary to bring it here—I generally enter all bills in my bill book—that bill was entered—I have not been to Manchester since the examination at the Mansion House—I have been in communication with several parties at Manchester—I suppose I have a business there—I cannot say what business is doing—I keep a place for which I am paying 130l a year rent—it is about a fortnight since I was examined at the Mansion House—the letter in which the bill was enclosed is at Manchester if it is in existence—I have been asked before where that letter was and I made a statement—I have not caused any search to be made for it—I thought it was not necessary as the writer of the letter was present—the prisoner came into my service about February 1854—I cannot state the day without referring to my books those books are at Manchester—he came for 30 a week salary—I think for the first day or two I made a bargain with him to give him a less sum and a small commission upon what business he could do—I cannot say what the commission was without referring but subsequently we arranged it at 30s a week in lien of the commission—he was bookkeeper and salesman—he left before the middle of Aug —that was after I had received this bill—I kept an account with the bank the bill was discounted for me there it was paid in to my account and I had credit for it in the ordinary way leas discount—the conversation I have related with the prisoner was after my return from Manchester before he left—I cannot say whether I remained at Manchester three or four days or a week after I received the bill but it was a very short time and this conversation occurred immediately after my return to London—I told him 1 had received a bill accepted by Mr Cross and asked him if it was good—I believe he did sell a sewing machine to Mr Cross—I believe Mr Cross to be a very respectable man—the prisoner was only instructed or authorised to stop at Plymouth a week—I received letters from him repeatedly while he was there I think up to within a few days of his return which was about 19th or 20th July—he had been absent about four weeks—I had recalled him by letter when he had been there a little over his time I think a letter was written by Mr Dresser for me—that was before I went to Manchester—there was a reply to that letter—I do not know that while the prisoner was at Plymouth he was engaged in endeavouring to sell my machines—several machines have not been sold there on my account or for me—I am a merchant for the sale of these machines—I also sell gas regulators and a variety of things—Mr Dresser is at present working for a Mr Wandsworth selling sewing machines but he is also travelling soliciting orders for me for gas regulators and sewing machines—I have never had a partner that I am aware of—I do not know that I have had a partner since I have been in England—Mr Dresser never was my partner nor Mr Harris—I have never done business in the name of Judkins and Co in England or Dresser and Co never in any name but my own—Mr Dresser baa been engaged in the sale of sewing machines—I sold him some the same as other persons and I let my place at No 2 Lawrence lane to Mr Dresser and took premises at No 23 Cannon-street West we were not both carrying on the same business there at the same time—I have sold him machines and I may have borrowed some back from him if I was out of them if I did I always paid for them or returned them in kind—there have been a good many monetary transactions between me and Mr Dresser at different times all the way through he owed me money at the time I received this bill and so he has a great deal of the time since he has been in this country—I never pressed him for payment—he has accepted bills for me not for my accommodation but to cover the amount he owed me in payment for the machines—I do not recollect that I was receiving bills with his acceptance about this time I might and I might not—my circumstances were not very flourishing at that time they were not bad—I have had the misfortune to become bankrupt about twelve months after the prisoner left me I wonder I had not sooner—I discharged him for improper conduct I swear that—there was no difference between us or any ill feeling that I was aware of when I discharged him—I talked to him as I would to a brother I was sorry he had kept bad company and hoped he would try to redeem himself—there was no lady in the case that I know of—I do not know that he ever alluded to a lady to me except on one or two evenings when he asked me to let him go earlier as he wanted to take his wife to the Panopticon or some place of amusement which I always allowed him to do—there was never any quarrel between us as to that matter I swear that—I never spoke to his wife twice before he left me—I have been connected a good deal with bills of exchange—I do not know that I have discounted bills for other parties—I know Mr Chandler—I never took bills from him to get discounted—my bankers hold his dishonoured bilk for 200l —they were bills given to me to get discounted by Mr Paul he wanted me to take them to my bank to see if they would discount them and gave very respectable reference to Mr Chandler describing him as a merchant in a large way of business and a very respectable man—to oblige him I said I would take the reference and forward the bills to the bank and if they were willing to do them upon the reference I would get them done—I sent them to my bankers aft Manchester bat before I had any reply Mr Paul wanted to purchase thirty sewing machines from me I agreed if he took the thirty fee should have them at 20l each he had then made an arrangement with Mr Dresser to carry on business as A P Dresser and Co —Mr Chandler was to be partner with them and was to furnish some money so Mr Paul said and those bills then went as a setoff for ten machines that were then delivered and that was all the payment I had for the machines—I afterwards delivered machines to that firm to a large amount and I believe there is a large balance due besides those bills that lie dishonoured—the bills are indorsed by Mr Paul—I know that the machines were traced into the possession of Mr Chandler after Dresser and Co gave up business at Broad-street-buildings—I do not know who finally had the proceeds of them or anything about them—since the prisoner s committal his wife has called upon me—I have not since the committal made an offer to retire from the prosecution if the prisoner could pay me 40l —I swear that not at any time—I did not know where the prisoner was until I gave him in charge but I frequently heard that he was in France—Mr Dresser informed me that he had met him in the street two three or four weeks before—he did not tell me that he had given him his address—I asked him if he thought he could find out where he was and I have been on the look out for him since I had no reason to doubt that he was in Paris at the Exhibition—I did not know that he was honorary secretary to the British exhibitors there MR PARRY Q Did you know anything about him at Paris A I heard that he was in Paris and that he was in and out of the Exhibition—I do not know that he held any office there—I did not go to Paris on account of the expense—I know nothing of my own knowledge of his character at Paris—I have heard that he was discharged from the first situation that he went into—I have had various dealings with parties in endeavouring to push the sale of my invention and I have owned patents jointly with other parties—there have been deeds drawn up between us in all cases in which it was expressed that we should not be partners in any way—I am by birth a citizen of the United States—I do not understand what the law of partnership may be here but I understand that a division of profits constitutes partnership—I had discharged the prisoner s predecessor for dishonesty and he knew it and that he had made false entries in my books and been drinking instead of attending to my business and I found that the prisoner formed a very intimate attachment to him—I talked to him about it and hoped he would keep better company in future—that was the reason I discharged him—I have never received one farthing from the prisoner as having been paid to him by Mr Cross—this bill was the only thing I had in payment of the machine from him or from any one MR FRANCIS Q Did he not tell you that he had received 10l A He never told me that he had received anything and I did not know it until the bill was dishonoured—I did not suppose that he had received a penny towards it—5l was not all he received for his expenses at Plymouth—I lent him 3l 10s afterwards as he told me the bailiffs were in his house and his wife in great distress—I settled his expenses with him after he came back—I cannot recollect the exact amount I paid him—it was not much because he was usually in advance of his wages MR PARRY Q Did you receive this letter signed by him A Yes it is his handwriting addressed to Mr Dresser— read Globe Plymouth July 16th 1854 Dear Sir I received yours this morning having been posted too late on Friday I should have come up on Saturday but a good bargain I have in view suggested my remaining until Monday when I hope to do something very beneficial to all of us Excuse haste I am only just in time for post ALBION PARIS DRESSER I am at present a traveller for Mr Judkins I was in business for myself as a merchant I remember the prisoner being in the employment of Mr Judkins—I knew him from about 1st June 1854 as Mr Judkins s bookkeeper—I remember his going down to Plymouth with one of the sewing machines—I was at that time acting for Mr Judkins in London attending to his business during his absence—I received this letter of 16th July from the prisoner while he was at Plymouth in answer to one that I had written to him—he afterwards came to town and I saw him—I told him that Mr Judkins had requested me to receive the amount he had received and forward it to him at Manchester and he presented me with this bill of exchange purporting to be accepted by Mr Cross of Plymouth—he said that Mr Judkins had instructed him to receive good paper in case he could not get the money and he had received this for the sewing machine—I forwarded it to Mr Judkins at Manchester in an envelope—I saw the prisoner I may say every day until about the last of Aug after which I saw him frequently until some time in Oct —I did not see him then until about six or eight weeks ago when I met him on this side Blackfriars-bridge—I spoke to him and asked what he was doing or what he had been doing—he said he had been at Paris—I said nothing to him about the forged bill—he gave me a circular where his name appeared as honorary secretary of the Paris Exhibition where he said his address was in London I cannot say but he gave it me—I informed Mr Judkins of having met him—I cannot say whether I told Mr Judkins the Address the prisoner gave me or not I think not Cross-examined Q You are quite clear that he gave you his address when you met him A He did I communicated to Mr Judkins that same day that I had met him—I do not know whether I told him that the prisoner had given me his address I believe not but I am not sure—I knew at this time that the bill was said to be forged—I think it was four or five weeks before he was taken into custody that I met him—I was not particularly anxious to find him so far as I was concerned—I was then traveller for Mr Judkins—I do not know whether Mr Judkins made any effort to find him—I called on Mr Judkins the evening the prisoner was taken and he told me he had heard that he visited a dancing house near Westminster-bridge and asked me to accompany him there which I did—when the prisoner came back from Plymouth he told me that he had got this bill for 25l for the machine—he said he had sold it for 25l and had received this bill for it—I believe this to be the same bill—I never received but that one bill from him—I can swear the bill I received from him had Mr Gross s name upon it and was for 25l —he gave it to me at No 2 Lawrence-lane I should think between 3 and 5 o clock—no one else was present in the private office—he did not then or at any other time tell me that he had received 10l on account of that machine—I swear most positively he did not tell me that he had received 10l that 5l was to be paid in three months and the rest was to be taken out of the amount of the commission nothing of the kind—I did not know that Mr Cross was to receive a commission upon the sale of machines I wrote three or lour letters to the prisoner while he was at Plymouth—I am not aware that other machines have been sold there—I hare not sent any there—I did not make a copy of the letters that I sent the bill in—I posted the letter myself in company with the prisoner—I have no books here—I do not know whether Mr Judkins has a letter book—I believe he had at that time—it was not my business to enter any letters I sent—I was not employed by Mr Judkins beyond looking after his business I had business of my own as well—Mr Judkins has never told me that there were unsettled accounts between the prisoner and himself—I cannot fix the date at which I sent this bill I think it was about 20th July—I believe I owed Mr Judkins money at that time I have owed him money several timeshe was not pressing me for payment—I was not giving him my acceptances at that time—I have given him my acceptance—I have been a witness before—I do not know that the jury were not disposed to believe me they did not tell me go—the Judge did not ask the jury nor did they say in my presence that they could not believe me—the first time I saw the prisoner on the day he delivered the bill to me was I think about 11 o clock from 10 to 12 o clock—he was there nearly all day— there was not much business done but he was there in the office with me—I cannot swear to the handwriting of the hill I think if it is Mr Stout s it is disguised—the acceptance does not look to me to be the same handwriting—I cannot say whether it is or not MR PARRY Q Have you any belief as to the handwriting of the body of the bill A I believe it to be Mr Stout s disguised—it has something of the appearance of his handwriting and yet it is not his natural hand-writing writing—I have accepted bills for Mr Judkins—they were for sewing machines which I had from him—I was not told by a jury that they could not believe me—there was a witness in the same case named Kendall I believe they told him they could not believe him BENJAMIN CROCKER CROSS I am a tailor and outfitter at Millbay Plymouth In July 1854 I bought a sewing machine of the prisoner—I should think it was about the 14th July—it was to be sold for 30l —I am quite sure it was not earlier than the 14th he had called at my establishment before but had not seen me—I think the day on which he sold me the machine was about the 17th—he told me that the selling price of the machine was 30l —he called two or three times I objected to purchasing at first but he held out certain inducements—he stated that they wanted an agent for the West of England and if I took that agency he would allow me 5l on each machine sold—I still refused having previously been offered a machine of the same make for 15l —he said if I would give him 20l for it he would sell it—I afterwards said if he would sell it for 25l with the commission off I would give him 15l in cash and the two first commissions when two were sold in the district—he agreed to those terms—at the same time I bought of him a gas regulator for 2l 15s nett—I gave him this cheque produced for 11l 15s that was 10l in part payment of the machine and 1l 15s with a sovereign that I gave him for the gas regulator—these are the receipts he gave me on 17th July—he represented himself as coming from Mr Judkins of London I knew that by the machine being sent to a public exhibition— The papers were here read receipted by the prisoner —I saw the prisoner again on 18th October 1854 at my house at Plymouth—he had not up to that time sent me any gas regulator—I paid him 2l 5s in cash which made up the 15l for the sewing machine—this is the receipt he gave me—that balanced the transaction—the 2l 15s that I had paid him for the gas regulator was to go towards the sewing machine—the acceptance to this bill is not in my handwriting nor the body—I never knew or heard anything of this bill until it was presented to me for payment—it is a forgery—I never authorised any one to draw a bill upon me Cross-examined Q All you actually gave for this machine was 15l A Yes in cash—I am in a large way of business—I constantly have bill transactions—they vary in amount from 200l or 300l down to 25l or 30l —25l is not at all an unusual amount—I carry on business as Cross & Co —I have no partner—I am not a great deal in the business for some hours in the day not wholly I have a responsible managing man—in my absence he takes a responsible part in the business—I never saw this bill till I saw it at the Mansion House—I always sign my name B C Cross not Cross & Co MR PARRY Q What is your responsible man A A foreman—I pay him wages 30s a week—I never authorise him to accept bills for me—this bill is not at all like his writing he never pays any bills of any amount for me COURT Q What passed when the prisoner came to you in October A He told me that he had left Mr Judkins and taken a certain amount of sewing machines out of the firm for his part of the capital that was put in it—he represented himself as one of the firm he said he had been one of the firm and they had dissolved partnership and he was going on by himself—he did not say why he came to receive this money I thought he was authorised to come down and settle all the affairs as is usual—he did not say so MR PARRY to MR DRESSER Q When the prisoner returned to town did he say anything to you about having sold a gas regulating machine A Some days after he did from the fact of having received a letter from Mr Cross as to the machine in which he stated that he had not heard of the gas regulator—the prisoner said he had sold him one but had not received the money for it—I told him I had received a letter from Mr Cross the letter was addressed to the Sewing Machine Company and I opened it—when he gave me the bill he said he had received it from Mr Cross MR FRANCIS Q Did not he say it was on account of the machine A He said it was for the sewing machine that he had sold to Mr Cross—he said he had sold the sewing machine to Mr Cross for 25l and received this in payment for the same of Mr Cross—he did not mention the regulating machine then—perhaps it was a week after that I spoke to him about it—I showed him Mr Cross s letter—the letter did not state that the gas regulator was paid for HENRY DYER I am the prisoner s brother-in-law I remember his returning to town from Plymouth in July 1854—I saw him the day after his return it was somewhere about the 20th—I am not positive as to the date—I met him accidentally—I said to him You are come back at last then t after being away for three weeks or a month leaving his wife in a most anxious state—he pulled a bill of exchange out of his pocket and said I received this bill for the sewing machine —I said to him Will you go and have a glass of ale —he said Yes T do not mind if I do but I have no money in my pocket and I took him into a public house at the corner of Bath-street City-road and gave him a glass of stout Cross-examined Q When were you spoken to about this matter A I was not spoken to—I saw the account in the paper and I went to Mr Judkins s warehouse—the prisoner showed me the bill—I read the words Four months after date and no more—it was for 25l —I am quite sure of that—I do not know whether it had the drawer s name to it he held it between the two lines and I never took it out of his hand—the prisoner married my wife s sister—he never told me that Mr Judkins owed him money nor that he could never get a settlement with him—he did not mention Mr Cross s name—he said the bill was for a sewing machine—he never had any sewing machines on his own account—it was in Bath-street City-road that I met him about half past 10 or 11 o clock in the morning—it was the day after he came from Plymouth MR PARRY Q Did he say he had had this bill for a sewing machine that he had sold there for Mr Judkins A Yes ALBION PARIS DRESSER re-examined At the time I received the bill from him it had no drawer s name on it it was in blank GUILTY of uttering Aged 26 — Transported for Fourteen Years It was stated on the part of the Prosecution that the prisoner had been previously convicted of embezzlement and imprisoned for twelve months and that he had got into the prosecutor s employment by means of a false

t18560616-670  670 CHARLES CHRISTIAN MOLLER and WILLIAM FOSTER feloniously making upon a copper plate a promissory note for the payment of money purporting to be a note of the Malare Provinces Private Bank recognised by Oscar King of Sweden MESSRS BODKIN and SLEIGH conducted the Prosecution CHARLES MORRISH I am an engraver of No 50 Oakley-street Lambeth About 29th April Foster called on me and showed me a foreign bank note and asked me if it was possible to copy it—I told him it was quite possible—he wanted to know the expense—I asked him if he wanted it on steel or copper—he asked if there would be any difference in the expense—I said that it would depend entirely on the number of copies they might with struck off—he said that he was not sure how many but he imagined they would require about 8 000—I told him the expense would be 4l for engraving—he said that it was not for himself he had other parties to show it to and he could not give me an answer then but would call again—he called on 2nd May and showed me another note that was not like the former he asked me if that would be more difficult and more expense—I told him Yes and that I should expect 8l for doing that—he said that he had had an estimate from Mr Austin of Bartlett s-buildings Holborn who had offered to do it for 3l 10s —I then said that I would do it for three guineas—this produced is the note to which he referred he took it away in that occasion and I think both prisoners called on me on the 6th—they produced the note again gave me the order produced a blank copper plate and gave me the order to go on with it to engrave a face simile—Foster gave me two sovereigns and a half in the shop for which I gave him a memorandum—Holler was then outside and Foster told me not to take notice of the money transaction before the other as he did not want him to know the terms—he then called Holier into the shop and said that we had made the arrangement he pointed to the note and said that it must be exactly like it—one of them asked me what time it would be and I said Ten or twelve days —Foster said that he should look in occasionally as he passed to see the progress of the work—the name of Hughes and Kimber of Shoe-lane is stamped upon the plate as the makers of it—I communicated on that very day with the solicitors for the prosecution and subsequently with the Swedish Consul—on 12th May the prisoners called to see the progress of the work but I told them I had nothing to show them—on the evening of the 15th they came again together and asked what progress I had made in the work—I showed them the plate of which I had done a small portion—Foster on that occasion showed me a piece of plate paper and Holier asked me if I knew what make it was whether it was English or foreign he said that he rather thought it was Dutch make—I think Foster came alone early on the morning of the 17th the day the plate was to be completed—I said that it would not be ready till the following Wednesday the 21st—on the 21st Foster called and I told him that I had no doubt that the plate was completed that it was at the machine rulers but I had a proof or two unfinished—he said that he had another party to show them to and took them away—in about an hour both prisoners came and Foster said I have now brought the gentleman with me —that was Holler—these produced are the two impressions Foster produced them and showed me that I had omitted putting two dots over the first a in the word Malare and that if I looked at the original I should see it—I said that the note was with the plate at the machine ruler s bat I could alter it—I said that I should have a sovereign to pay to the machine ruler and no doubt they could have it complete in two hours—Moller paid me a sovereign and asked me whether I was busy—I said that I was that week but the following week I should have very little or nothing to do—he said that he could be able to give me another job—the plate produced in the one I engraved by their direction and the impressions taken from it are what I gave to Foster Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q How do you know that this is the Dote A I think you will find my initials at the back of it—you may consider this a very clumsy imitation I did it in a hurry I knew that it was not to go through the hands of a banker—it pleased my customers they said that it was very good—I did it as speedily as possible—it is not done nearly as well as the original—I engraved every stroke of it with my own hand CHARLES AUSTIN I am a copper-plate printer of Bartlett s-building In April last two persons came to me—the prisoners resemble them but I cannot be positive—I believe they are the men—they produced a foreign note and asked me what I would engrave a face simile of it for—I said that I would do it for 3l 10s —they also produced a copper plate on which they wished it engraved—I did not notice it at the time but afterwards I noticed the name of Hughes and Kimber on it—there is no other engraver or printer in Bartlett s-buildings besides myself Cross-examined Q You did not recognise them before the magistrate A No I did not swear to them and I never mean to—I say just the same now as then COURT Q Do I understand you to say that looking at these two men though unable to swear to them you believe they are the men that came into your shop A I believe they are but only from my ideas of the note which was shown to me—the men only came once Q Have you any recollection of the men so as to form a belief A Well I believe one to be a foreigner that is all WILLIAM TOOVEY ASHFFELD I am a printer of No 6 Church-street Lambeth On 16th May the prisoners called on me produced a note and asked me what I should charge to print 1 000 something similar to that—I MR ROBINSON objected to this evidence as not being part of the case of forgery MR BODKIN stated that he considered it of little importance and would rather waive it than discuss it JAMES STANGE policeman L 89 I was employed to watch Mr Morrish s house and on 12th May went there in plain clothes and saw the prisoners within a yard or two of the door about 11 o clock in the morning—they both went in together and in six or seven minutes came out together and went down Oakley-street into the Westminster-road and over Westminster-bridge where I lost sight of them—they were together all the while they were under my observation—I had orders to follow them—I lost sight of them in a very peculiar place—there is a court there and I did not wish them to see that I was following them—on 15th I was at Mr Morrish s again and Foster came at about half-past six o clock in the evening—I followed him over Blackfriars-bridge to Devonshire-street Queen-square Holborn—I did not see him go into a house but I had a boy with me who did—on 21st May I was at Mr Morrish s again and about 1 o clock Foster entered the shop—he was there about five or six minutes and I saw him come out with a paper parcel in his hand—he walked down Oakley-street and I followed him into the Westminster-road—he went into Mount s gardens and I saw the two prisoners there in Carlisle-lane I did not see the other join him but he went into a court and soon after I saw them both together in Carlisle-lane —they went along North street—and then they both looked at a paper—it appeared to be strange paper with the impression of a bank note on it—they both had it in their hands—it was like this note—Thornton and another officer were in the neighbourhood—I assisted Sergeant Williamson in taking the prisoners Cross-examined Q Was it 21st May A Yes I had followed them that day about an hour—I did not want them to see me and kept at a respectful distance—I was in a court in North-street and they were standing there and being in plain clothes I passed them and saw the paper—they both held it—they had their faces towards it and towards the street—they appeared to me to be both holding it and looking at it—I did not pass quickly I walked slowly along—the court is about three yards wide I suppose it is not quite so wide as this Court—I was alone COURT Q Where was it you saw them looking at the paper A In a court in North-street I was walking along the street and saw them in the court looking towards the street—I was about two yards from them when I passed the end of the court STEPHEN THORNTON police inspector A I am chief of the detective force On 21st May I was in the neighbourhood of Mr Morrish s shop and saw Foster about 1 o clock—I followed him some short time afterwards and saw him turn round the top of Oakley-street where I lost sight of him and the other prisoner together—there is a court in North-street—I saw them there with these two papers in their hands open like this examining them—I passed by and then returned and they were still standing in the court they afterwards came out and Foster was wrapping something up in a piece of paper which appeared to me to be these impressions he put them into his coat pocket—after that I again saw them in Mr Morrish s shop but did not see them go in—they came out in about six or seven minutes and I and another officer followed them and took them into custody—I searched Foster and found these impressions rolled up in his coat tail pocket and these two other papers produced on which some manuscript words are—Holler was searched by Sergeant Williamson—Foster refused his address at first—he was asked his name but I do not recollect what he said I could not say positively whether he gave it Cross-examined Q Did he give an answer A Yes but I do not recollect what it was—I believe he refused his address—we did not know where he was till we went to Holler s house and learned from Moller s wife where he did live—I believe he refused to give his address at first—I have not forgotten what he told me—I will not undertake to say that these are the two papers but they are similar papers—my belief is founded on the sight I had of them—they were turning their backs and each holding a corner of the paper—they were partly between me and the paper—I saw Stanage—we were in various positions sometimes before each other—I cannot tell whether Stanage had gone before me for we both went up and down the street—I went up and down and to the best of my knowledge went up again a third time—I do not mean that I saw them in the court three times—I do not know whether at the time I saw them in the court I was following Stanage or he me—there were three or four constables and we were doing our best to keep out of sight and found dodging up and down to be the best way and finding that they did not come I returned down the street and they were in the court again and I watched and saw them come out of the court—when I saw them reading the paper I was on the other side of another street which is seven or eight steps across or not much more—it is not as wide as Cornhill—it is a back street—the office of the clerk of the peace is at the corner and it runs into the Westminster road—I should think the street is as wide from kerb to kerb as from herd to that desk FREDERICK WILLIAMSON police sergeant I am a detective—I was with Thornton on the days in question—I was at the station when the prisoners were taken there—they were both asked their names and addresses and they refused them I think but am not sure of it for I was in a back part of the station—I searched Muller nothing material to this ease was found on him RICHARD MULLENS I am solicitor to the prosecution I was at the police station at Lambeth when the prisoners were brought there—the inspector on duty asked Moller his name and address—he refused to give either—he said I decline to state —I then told Moller what his name was because I knew him—the same question was then asked of Foster and he said I shall not give it —I did not know him before Cross-examined Q Was Thornton in the office A I am not sure—Williamson was in the outer part of the station—I believe I was alone in the inspector s room with him—I know the inspector by sight but do not know his name The two papers were not read being in Swedish but MR BODKIN stated that they were copies of the contents of the notes WILLIAM TOTTIE Esq I am vice-consul for Sweden and Norway and am one of the firm of Charles Tottie and Sons we are agents for the Malare Provinces Private Bank in Sweden The bank is at the town of Western—this is one of the notes of that bank I superintended its preparation—they were engraved in London and I transmitted them to Sweden by steam boat ten years ago—I do not swear to the note but there have been no notes printed but those I sent out—this is worth about 11s 1d in English money—the translation of it is The Malare Provinces Private Bank redeems on demand this note with six dollars six and thirty-two schillings banco Westerns 1st Oct 1847 —it entitles the bearer to receive the amount which in English money amounts to 11s 1d —six-dollars means dollars of the kingdom—these manuscript papers are transcripts of the contents of the note Cross-examined Q Have you ever been in Sweden A Yes nine years ago in 1847 that is the date of the notes—I only know by our correspondence that the bank is still existing—we are in constant correspondence with in MR BODKIN Q Are you their agents in London A Yes and have corresponded with them within a fortnight or three weeks This being the case for the prosecution MR ROBINSON contended that the existence of the company was not proved THE COURT considered that at present there was no proof of whom the company consisted COURT to W TOTTIE Esq Q Are you personally acquainted with the constitution of the bank A Yes I have the constitution at my office—the company consists of a body of shareholders—I am sufficiently acquainted with the law of Sweden to know that they are a corporate body MR ROBINSON Q You say that there are shareholders you do not know who they are except by some document which you have A I cannot say—there are directors they vary some of them go out by rotation and others come in—I only know the constitution from the papers at my office COURT Q Where is your office A In Broad-street—here is an official translation produced of the constitution by a clerk in my office it has been made recently—if the original is produced you will not understand much of it—I got it at the Parliamentary paper office in Sweden or it was bought for me—that was when it was first issued I forget the date it was 1845 or 1846 looking at the translation no 1847—oh here is the Act itself attached to the translation MR BODKIN Q Have you been in Sweden A I have—I have never been at the office of the bank—I have repeatedly taken these notes not only in Sweden but here—I know that the bank is composed of more shareholders than one—I have not the remotest doubt that the bank exists as a body corporate—I know that it does I am in constant communication with it COURT Q Having been in Sweden can you say whether this bank is reputed to be a corporation A Yes it is—it is seven years sine I was there but I am in constant communication with it is officially and non-officially—I did not bring this document with me from Sweden it is in Swedish and it published by Government—it is printed at the royal public press at Stockholm as will be found upon it— MR ROBINSON suggested that this could not be evidence as somebody else merely told the witness that he bought it there —when I was in Westerns in 1847 I bad had all the trouble of getting these notes printed and a deputation waited on me and invited me to an entertainment—I forgot that before—I dined with the Directors— MR ROBINSON objected to the document being read MR BODKIN pressed to being read to which the COURT acceded COURT to W TOTTIE Esq Q I must ask you to translate a portion of it A It is all translated—I have not examined it with the translation—this the original is in Swedish it is an act of His Majesty in Council signed by the King and countersigned by one of the Secretaries of State The witness read parts of the document by which it appeared that the company was incorporated in 1847 as a banking company trading within the Malare provinces Signed Oscar King of Sweden to be read from the pulpit —that is it is to be read from every pulpit in Sweden—that means proclaimed —I know this document to be one of the State Acts of Sweden— The COURT decided upon admitting it as evidence MR ROBINSON Q You never passed one of these notes in Sweden A Yes I transmitted them to Sweden but I was there after that in 1847—they are in general circulation I continually have remittances from Sweden in these notes now—I have had them consigned to me—I have taken them myself recently MR ROBINSON contended that there was no proof that the notes were still in circulation THE COURT considered that there was MR ROBINSON then contended that there was no engraving of a perfect note by the prisoners and as to a part of a note it was a mere constructive engraving done by an innocent agent and the note not being finished the ornamental part being omitted the prisoners would only be answerable for what they themselves ordered it never being the intention to have part of a note engraved Mr Morrish choosing before the note was perfect to do something which was not within the original order and further that it was necessary to show that the prisoners had done it fraudulently MR RECORDER in leaving the case to the Jury was of opinion that it came within the legal principle of omne majus continet in se minus that if a man orders the whole he may be taken to order a part and as to their having done it fraudulently there was no such word in the Act of Parliament which stated If any person shall engrave or have in their possession without authority the word engrave meaning engrave fraudulently if however it became necessary the point might be reserved MOLLER— GUILTY with intent to defraud Aged 45 FOSTER— GUILTY with intent to defraud Aged 30 The prisoners were further charged with having been before convicted DANIEL FORRESTER I produce a certificate of Moller s Conviction— Read Central

t18560818-759  759 JOACHIM SEVILLA feloniously and without lawful excuse having in his custody and possession 100 pieces of paper impressed with part of an undertaking for the payment of money of the Republic of Peru without the authority of that State MESSRS BODKIN and POLAND conducted the Prosecution HENRY KENDALL I am the consul in London for the Republic of Peru This prosecution is instituted by the direction of the Peruvian Minister—I have not seen the slave bonds of the Peruvian government before these—I know that the Peruvian government have issued such bonds—I an aware of that officially—I know the handwriting of the President of the Republic Ramon Castillio and also of the Minister of Finance Jose Fabie Melgar from communications I have received from him and also of Ysadio d Aramburu he is President of the Liquidating Commission the Slave Commission—I find the signature of those three gentlemen to this bond produced —I do not know the signatures of the fourth gentleman I am not familiar with it—the three signatures to this bond I believe to be genuine—this is a bond for 300 pesos—a peso is a Peruvian coin the values of it is 3s 10d they are dollars in fact—I have not made a translation of that bond but have seen one—this produced is an accurate translation Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Have you ever seen any of these bonds before A No—I know that there are such bonds in circulation in Pera—I know it by communications from the government to me that is my only source of knowledge as I am in this country—it is fifteen years since I was in Peru—this is the first time I have ever seen any of these bonds—this transaction is the first occasion upon which I have ever seen them—I have seen the President write in Lima from fifteen to twenty years ago—he was Minister of Finance then—I have seen M d Aramburu write at the same period—he was then a merchant he also held various offices—I have not seen M Melgar write—I can speak to his signature because I am is the habit of receiving dispatches from him in his capacity of Minister of Finance—I received dispatches from him two or three posts ago with the last two months—he has signed my own bills of exchange—he has been Minister of Finance some months but he has been Minister of Finance on one or two occasions previously then been superseded by another and then has come in again—they are perpetually changing in Peru—there are not quite so many as two or three Presidents in a few months or a year—unfortunately there have been a great many revolutions—I am not aware of any disarrangement of the currency whatever circulates as currency has always remained the same—the government that comes in pays the bonds which the other government has undertaken that has always been so—I am not aware that they have ever been refused—I do not know of my own know ledge that these bonds are at present in circulation—I am pretty well satisfied that they have not been withdrawn from circulation by the government I have seen orders about the payment of them within the last six weeks or the last month—there are various kinds of bonds that they undertake to pay not a great many—this is a bond given in compensation for slaves liberated—I do not think that a commission is now actually sitting about them and tint they are not at present in circulation—at this distance I could not undertake to say it is not the case—I do not know everything that goas on there MR BODKIN Q Upon the occasion of one change in 1855 were the slaves in the Repmblic of Peru declared free A They wort that was the first act of the government of General Castillio when he came into power—as far aa my knowledge goes that government is still existing and in power—these bonds were not issued immediately to recompense the owners of the slaves but a commission was appointed to investigate the claims of the slave proprietors and these were given in payment—although it is fifteen years since I saw the President write I have been in correspondence with him ever since more or less and also with the official persons connected with the government at present in power at Peru—I believe these are valid bonds at this time— A translation of the bond was had read Peruvian Republic Lima Value—No — Liberation of Slaves decreed at Huancayo 30th Dec 1 54 Bond for the sum of—pesos arising from the manumission of slaves and freed men which is according to the claim registered under No —belonged to—which sum is acknowledged by the nation and it binds itself to satisfy the same by payment to bearer in the course of three years with interest at one half percent monthly in conformity with what is set forth in articles 10 and 15 of the supreme decree of 9th March 1855 Lima —the President of the Republic Ramon Castillio the Minister of Finance Jose Fabio Melgar the President of the Liquidation Commission Ysadio d Aramburu the Secretary of the Liquidation Commission Pedro Paz Soldan The were set out in the document JOHN BRYCE I am a merchant and formerly lived at Callao and Lima in Pen I lived there about twenty years—I left in March this year—to have seen a few of these bonds negotiated in Peru they pass from hand to hand—after the owner of the slaves whose name appears in the bond has endorsed it then it passes from hand to hand—I am acquainted with the handwriting of the President—I have no doubt this signature Ramon Castillio is his—he was the President when I left in March last—I have seen the signature of Pedro Paz Soldan Secretary of the Commission to these documents—I have seen eight or ten of these documents signed by him but I did not know his signature until I saw it on these documents—I have never seen him write—I have seen Mr Melgar write—I have doubt but this is his signature—I have never seen Ysadio d Airamburu write but I have seen his signature often to documents of this sort and letters Cross-examined Q When did you leave Peru A Last March—these bounds have never been withdrawn from circulation—there it no payment the payment I believe is to be in three years—they are current in the market but are not paid by the government—there has not been a committee appointed to inquire about those that are issued to my knowledge JOSE GONZALEZ DEL REIGO through an interpreter I am a Peruvian I came from Peru on 15th March this year—I had slaves at the time of the liberation in 1855—when the slaves were liberated bonds of this description were given to the slave owners I had some given to me—this appears to be a genuine slave bond similar to that given to me upon the liberation of my slaves Cross-examined Q How long is it since you received bonds A Last year when the slaves were manumitted—they have never refused payment of tie bonds—I believe that the names to the bonds I received were the same as those to this bond HERMAN DEUTSCH I live at No 6 Carpenter s-buildings London-wall I am a German I carry on the business of a lithographer The prisoner came to my place of business on Friday 27th June last—he first spoke to me in French a language I do not understand—on telling him that he spoke in English—he said I want you to do me some facsimiles —he at first asked me whether I could do fac-similes and I said Yes —when I showed him the specimens he said That is the very thing I want —he then showed me a piece of newspaper to indicate the size of what he wanted—he wanted me to do between 100 and 125 fac-similes—I asked him some questions upon that—he said I want 125 —he showed me how to place them and I said You want them for portraits —he said Yes —he asked me for the price—I made out my estimate and told him it would be 8l or 8l 10s —he said Have you got 125 stones of the size —I said Yes —he said If you have not got them all that size I would rather pay you a sovereign more —he said Are you a printer yourself —I said Yes —he said That is all right then —he then produced a paper from his pocket and showed it me—he wanted me to do the signature to make a fac-simile of the signature—I undertook to do it—he was to call and see it the next day at 12 o clock Saturday—he then went away—he came at 12 o clock on Saturday—I had done the fac-simile and showed it to him—this is it—he compared it with the letter and said it was excellently done he would send it off by post on Saturday and let me have an answer in about two days—he came again on the Monday 30th June—he first produced to me this paper—it was printed without the signatures—he wanted me to do the signatures the fac-similes from the signatures which he brought—I see the signatures that have been cut out of the genuine bond—they were the signatures that he produced to me and wished me to put on the blank me that he brought—I asked him what the paper was—he said They are only passports to send persons to South America —I undertook to make the fac-similes—he then produced a parcel of similar papers without the signatures about 100—I was to affix the same signatures to those 100—I was to get them done for him in fourteen days—he first spoke to me about 100 or 125 fac-similes—after he showed me that parcel he said I want instead of 125 fac-similes 1 500 —I made my estimate out and told him it would be 18l —he agreed to pay it—I asked him who he was and where he lived—he said Oh I am living in the country —I said Well will you oblige me with some reference please —I asked him his name and address then I asked him for a reference—he said Well I shall leave you a deposit how much shall I leave you —I said About five or six pounds —he said I shall leave you 4l he left me 4l for which I gave him a receipt—I made some inquiry of lie Peruvian Consul next morning—I was afterwards introduced to an officer of the detective police and acted under his orders—after this the prisoner came to me every day and brought me other papers to do—I had 200 finished by the Wednesday with the signatures to them—he called on the Wednesday—I have blinds to my windows—he said Can you manage Mr Deutsch to keep your door shut and your blinds down —I said Oh I can manage that —he wanted me to finish off a certain number a day and let him have them and I declined that I said I would not deliver them until they were all finished—he called from day to day to see how they were getting on—I showed them to him from time to time—afterwards he asked me to return him the original signatures that be brought me to make the fac-similes from—that I refused to do—he came to my place on the Friday—he looked at the papers and said Now Mr Deutsch I know you are an honest man and you can perhaps find a person in whom you can place confidence to fill that up the written part—he said he would give 4l or 5l for it—I said that I would do my best I could perhaps find some one—I was to give him an answer about that on the Saturday—I think it was about half past 1 o clock or half past 2 when he left me on the Friday—I did not see him again till he was in custody—the paper that has 12 on the back of it is one that I affixed the signatures to for him—it is one of the parcel that I did Cross-examined Q How often did he call upon you A Every day—he did not mention to me in the first instance that he had been commissioned by somebody—at first he spoke French then he spoke English to me—he speaks English very well I could understand him very well—he did not say that he was sent by anybody—I am quite sure of that—I have done fac-similes before frequently of circulars for merchants—I never did any bonds before nothing of the kind—I never knew him before—he came to me on the 27th June on the Friday it was about half past 3 o clock in the afternoon—I have been sworn to-day in the usual way—I am a Jew—I was sworn on the New Testament I think that oath binds me just as well—I have not been sworn on the Old Testament—I consider it equally binding on the New Testament EDWARD FUNNELL I am a detective police officer On Wednesday 2nd July Mr Deutsch made a communication to me—from what he told me I gave him certain directions and I watched his premises in Carpenter s buildings—on Friday the 4th I saw the prisoner come out—I followed him to No 15 Marylebone-street Golden-square—I followed him in there—I asked him to step out with me that I wanted to speak to him a moment—I told him I was a detective officer—he said What have I done —I told him the charge against him would be for inciting Herman Deutsch of No 6 Carpenter s-buildings to forge a lot of signatures to documents to defraud the Peruvian government and others he made no reply—I then took him into custody and put him into a cab—he became very much excited and said that we might be all thieves for what he knew—I had two more officers with me at the time—I then showed him my authority my warrant card—he said Take me to my Minister —I told him I should take him to the station house—I asked him if he knew Herman Deutsch—he said No —I said Not of Carpenter s-buildings —he said No —I told him that I had followed him from there that afternoon—I then showed him some papers that I had received from Deutsch they had been torn—I asked if he knew anything of these—he said No and what if I do —I said You do not know Carpenter s-buildings —he said No —I took him to the station house—I there searched him in a pocket book I found the bond No 12 and 54l 10s in money three leys and a gold watch—I then went to where he lodged and took possession of some more papers—the keys fitted the locks Cross-examined Q I believe you found a passport on him also A I did for China and a great many other places MR RIBTON submitted thai the instrument in question wot not correctly described in the indictment it had been called in the course of the evidence a bond and that was evidently its proper description and the 30th section of the Act 1 Wm 4 c 66 made a distinction between a bond and an under-taking MR BODKIN stated that the 30ih section applied to English securities MR BARON MARTIN was of opinion that whatever name might be given to the instrument it was correctly described as an undertaking for the payment of money MR RIBTON to JOHN BRYCE Q Have you known this gentleman for some time and his family A I hare known his family and his brother for some years—I must have met the prisoner himself once I think at dinner—his family are highly respectable his brother is a ship owner—I think the prisoner had a share in a speculation in guano to China and to bring back china to England GUILTY Aged 33 — Transported for Fourteen Years MR BODKIN stated that papers were found belonging to the prisoner which disclosed the fact that a regular partnership existed between himself and other to carry out the fraud in question

t18561027-1004  1004 WILLIAM SALT HARDWICKE and HENRY ATTWELL feloniously forging and uttering an order for the payment of 410l 7s 4d with intent to defraud MESSRS BODKIN and SLEIGH conducted the Prosecution AUGUSTUS BAILEY BUSHNELL I am a cashier at Messrs Gosling s the bankers in Fleet-street Mr Alfred Turner a solicitor of Red Lion-square keeps an account at our house—on 28th June last this cheque produced was presented to me for payment—I paid it in eight 50l notes and the rest in cash—the numbers of the nates were 89958 95701 and 96702 dated 8th Nov 1856 and 00640 dated 6th Feb 1866 02503 and 01021 doted 6th Feb 09165 and 98730 8th Nov 1855—I do not know who the person was that presented the cheque—while I was cashing it I saw the prisoner Hard-wicke at the counter—he asked me if I knew where a Mr Richards was to be found—I did not know but he interrupted me in paying this cheque and I desired him to wait until I had finished paying the cheque—he said he held a bill drawn on some other party and he could only get at the acceptor through Mr Richards that be understood the patty had returned from abroad and he wished to know where Mr Richards lived in order that he might get at that party—I desired him to wait till after I had paid the cheque and then I made inquiry where Mr Richards was—a Mr Owen Richards formerly kept an account at our house—Hardwicke gave the Christian name—Mr Richards was known but we did not know where he was—the greater part of this conversation occurred after I had paid the cheque—he spoke to me before I paid the cheque then he waited and then be interrupted me again MART MEEK I am the wife of George Meek of No 20 Nelson-square Blackfriars-road At the latter end of May last Hardwicke and his wife engaged lodgings at our house—they remained there from 28th May till he was taken into custody—I was present when the officer Scott searched the three rooms which they had occupied GEORGE SCOTT I am a detective officer of the City police On 18th Sept I searched Hardwicke s lodging at No 20 Nelson-square—Mrs Meek pointed out the first floor back room to me and in that room among other things I found this bill of exchange — This was a bill for 28l odd dated Feb 23 1848 drawn by Owen Richards on G W Whitaker solicitor No 5 Heathcote Street Mecklenburgh-square AUGUSTUS BAILEY BUSHNELL re-examined To the best of my belief this is Owen Richards writing—I believe it is a genuine bill ALFRED TURNER I am a solicitor in Red lion-square In June last I kept an account with Gosling and Co —the signature to this cheque is not mine—uo part of it was written with my knowledge or authority—it was not drawn in my office—the signature is very much as if it had been traced from mine it is not strong enough for mine—I should say the filling up is an imitation of the writing of my clerk Mr Wilson—he generally fills up my business cheques—early in March this year I lost a leather case—I think it is possible that there might have been one or two blank forms of cheques in it there was also a confidential letter from a client at Oxford addressed to me and the case had my name and address on it—I have no doubt there might have been one blank cheque in the case I think I can state there was one—I know Attwell as the person who represented himself as Hunter when I signed a cheque for 103l —before that I had no knowledge of him Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE for Hardwicke Q How are you able to say that there was a cheque in your pocket book when you lost it A Because I had taken out two cheques for the purpose of some private business I recollect there being one Cross-examined by MR DICKIE for Attwell Q Do you distinctly recollect the circumstance of Attwell calling on you A Perhaps I might mention that when the first demand was made for the 38l I happened to be in the office when a person called and paid it in gold and I took the money and handed it over to Mr Wilson—I do not see that person here—it was a genteel-looking young man—I am quite positive of Attwell and I will tell you why when the second debt was called for I was coming into the office just as the person who called himself Hunter was coming out and I went back into the office with him and signed the cheque and Mr Wilsen gave it him therefore I am positive of his identity ROBERT WILSON I am managing clerk to Mr Turner In April last Attwell called and instructed me to make application for the payment of an I O U—he said his name was Hunter and he resided in Pakenham-street Gray s-inn-road—he instructed me to write to a Mr Hesp No 58 Charrington-street Oakley-square—he handed me an I O U for 38l 18s 6d —he was a stranger to me and I asked him if he knew Mr Turner or who had recommended him there—he said Mr Turner had done business for him before—upon that I wrote for the payment and soon afterwards the amount of 38l 18s 6d was paid into the office it was received by Mr Turner and I subsequently sent the I O U by post—a day or two after the receipt of the money Attwell called at the office and I paid him the 38l in bank notes and gold—on 19th June Attwell called again—he then gave me instructions to write to a Mr Hart No 6 Milton-street Euston-square for the payment on an I O U of a sum of 103l 15s 6d —in accordance with his instructions I wrote to that address and within a day or two the amount was paid by a 50l note and the rest in gold—I paid it into Gosling s to Mr Turner s account—on 24th June Attwell applied to know whether the money had been recovered—I told him that it had and filled up this cheque produced procured Mr Turner s signature to it and handed it to Attwell—he signed this receipt for it—on 26th Sept I went to Yarmouth and there saw Attwell in custody—I immediately identified him Cross-examined by MR DICKIE Q Are you quite sure that Attwell called himself Hunter A Quite—he did not say that he represented Mr Hunter or that he was acting for Mr Hunter—I am quite sore of that MR BODKIN Q Is that the receipt which he signed in your presence A Yes it is signed H Hunter —I saw him sign that JOHN REES I now live at No 3 Brownlow-place Queen s-road Dalston In April May and June last I lived at No 10 Pakenham-street Gray s-inn-road—during those three months no person named Hunter lodged in that house—Attwell did not live there—I never saw him to my knowledge until he was in custody ELIZABETH SHOEBROOK I live at No 58 Charrington-street Oakley-square On Tuesday 1st April a gentleman called at my place and engaged a front parlour he gave the name of Hesp—he paid me a deposit of 2s—he was to pay 6s a week—he said he was going out of town till Thursday and should his luggage come and any letters would I take them in for him—two letters came—on Thursday he knocked at the door and asked if any letters had come—he walked into the back parlour took the two letters and walked off in a moment and I never saw him from that time to this ELIZA BREWER In June last I lived at No 6 Milton-street Euston-square In that month a person called and hired a front parlour—he gave the name of Hart—a letter came for him on the Tuesday evening—he called on the Wednesday morning and I gave him the letter—another letter came on the Friday which he called for on the Saturday morning and I never saw him afterwards—he never slept in the room or occupied it EDWARD PAYNE I am a clerk in the house of Gosling and Co bankars On 21st Jane 202l 13s 4d was paid in to the credit of Mr Alfred Turner s account—one of the items of that account wag a 50l Bank of Eogland note No 95320 dated

name of Harding No 48 High-street Bow was given by the person to whom it was issued JOHN MOSS I am a detective officer of the City I have been to High-street Bow to look for a Mr Harding—there is no No 48—I could not find any such person ROBERT WILSON re-examined When the last debt was paid a 50l note formed part of it—I did not take the number of it but I can recognise this as the note I wrote on it Hart 21-6-56 meaning 21st June 1856—I paid it into Gosling s AUGUSTUS BAILEY BUSHNBLL re-examined I paid this cheque for 103l fe 10d on 24th June with a 100l Bank of England note No 91657 dated 9th Aug 1855 and 3l 8s 10d in cash RICHARD ADYE BAILEY I am in the bank note accountant s office Bank of England This 100l note was presented to be changed for gold on 25th June—the name of William Matthews No 10 Old-street-road Middlesex was given GEORGE CLARK I keep a coffee house at No 10 Old-street-road and kve done so for the last three years During the whole of that period no person named Matthews has lived there to my knowledge WILLIAM HARDY I did reside at No 7 Euston-mews Euston-square I now live at No 50 Drummond-crescent I have been in the service of Colonel Portlock of Woolwich I left on 27th June—being then out of a situation I advertised in the Times—I received a letter in consequence of which I went to see a person of the name of Taylor at No 76 Albert-road Regent s park—I went there and saw a person and made an agreement to enter into his service—he did not say what I was to be but it was something of an under clerk as I understood—I was to have a guinea a week—he appointed to meet me next day at half past 1 o clock at the University hotel Tottenham-court-road—I went there and found him in the coffee room—he gave me a cheque for 410l 7s 4d —I could not swear to the cheque—it was like this produced and was on Gosling and Sharpe s Fleet-street—I took it there—he told me to ask for eight fifties and the rest in gold and to bring it to No 76 Albert-road where I had first seen him—after I had received the money at the bank I went towards Albert-road with it and when I got to Mornington-crescent I met Mr Taylor and gave him the money—he said he was going off to Liverpool by the next train—he gave me half a sovereign and I was to hear from him further about the situation—I have never seen him since or heard from him MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE here stated thai he was unable to resist the evidence in this case and that Hardwicke would under his advice withdraw his plea and plead Guilty MR BODKIN considered that as the Jury were charged the proper course would be to take a verdict of guilty at the dose of the case JOHN BEATTIE I am manager of the Temple-bar Branch of the Union Bank of London On 2nd July last a female called at the bank and said she wished to send 20l to Hamburg for Mr Richard Gurney she gave the name of Mrs Wilson High-street Woolwich —I received the money from her and advised it to our correspondent s at Hamburg the effect of that would be to give Mr Richard Gurney credit at that house for 20l —in Sept I went down to Yarmouth and there saw the person who had represented herself to me as Mrs Wilson she was there known as Mrs Ralph—I afterwards saw her in custody at the Mansion-house with Hard-wicke RICHARD MULLENS I am solicitor to the Committee of Associated Bankers in London In consequence of a communication made to me from Yarmouth I went there on 24th Sept and found the two prisoners in custody—on the 25th they were brought before the Magistrates there and Hard wicke answered to the name of Ralph and Attwell to the name of Attwood—I had an interview with Hard wicke at his own request—I saw his wife there—she was the person that was seen by Mr Beattie—on the following day I had another interview with Hardwicke and then he told me that his wife had gone to the Union Bank by his direction and that he in the name of Gurney bad received the 20l at Hamburg—his wife was at that time in custody—after this statement of his I told the Lord Mayor that I did not think it right to offer any evidence against her and she was discharged—I had never to my knowledge seen Hardwicke before—at first he denied ever having been at Hamburg but the next day he admitted that he had MARIA AUGUSTUS NATHANIEL PFINGSTHORN I manage the business of Messrs Stressau bankers and money changers at Hamburg On 5th July last the two prisoners called at our house Hardwicke presented a drift on our house for the value of 20l English money—I paid him the amount in French gold and the balance in Hamburg currency—he signed a receipt on the back of the cheque—this is his signature R Gurney —he signed it in my presence—he then said that he had been recommended to me by Messrs Bauer and Co the drawers of the cheque to change some hundreds of pounds of Bank of England notes—I agreed to change some for him—Attwell then drew out of his pocket a parcel and took out four 50l notes and laid them on the counter—my clerk took the numbers and gave him the change—the prisoners then spoke together and concluded to change four more 50l notes—Attwell also produced them out of his pocket and we gave him the change—I have here the numbers of the notes Reads 02502 01021 00640 89958 95701-2 99165 and 98730 Cross-examined by MR METCALFE Q Is that your memorandum taken at the time A Yes—I did not take the dates only the letters LK and L RICHARD ADYE BAILEY re-examined The letters always represent the date and denomination—those marked I were all dated 8th Nov and the others marked LK were all dated 6th Feb 1856 CHARLES HENRY CHAMBERLAIN I am a solicitor at Great Yarmouth On 30th Aug Attwell called on me he gave the name of Mr Henry Att-wood—he said that he wanted me to write to a Mr Edward Dixon of No 18 Compton-street Gray s Inn-road London who owed him 104l for goods sold—I asked him his own address and he gave me the Angel Inn Yar-mouth—I asked him several questions and he went on to say that Mr Dixon was one of those sort of persons who never would pay his debts unless under some sort of pressure but he had not the slightest doubt he would remit was the money—I wrote by the same post—this produced is my letter—I received in reply a letter promising the money in a few days and afterwards received 104l 3s 5d through a bank at Yarmouth—in consequence of some communication that I had with other solicitors in Yarmouth I saw Attwell on 15th Sept and asked him to give me an address—he at first said he would not give me his London address but he would give me his address in Yarmouth he would point it out—I said that might be reasonable and he should have a cab—he then said No gentlemen you know your business and I understand mine I shall do nothing of the kind —I said The circumstances are so suspicious that I shall desire you to be taken into custody and he was taken—this letter of mine I saw found at his lodging in Yarmouth—these promissory notes were taken from his person my name is on the back of one of them— These were two I O U s for 104l 3s 5d signed Eduwrd Dixon and 105l 14s signed Henry Jones CHARLES JOHN PALMER I am a solicitor in practice at Great Yar-mouth On 30th Aug Attwell called on me—he said his name was Henry Attwood and requested me to write to a person named William Jones of No 13 Union-terrace Bagnigge-wells-road London for 105l 14s which be stated was due to him—I asked him for the particulars of the debt—he said he had not the particulars with him but it was partly for goods sold and partly for money lent—I wrote to the address he gave me and afterwards received the amount—this is the letter I wrote HENRY BLAKE MILLER I am a solicitor at Norwich On 1st Sept Attwell called on me representing himself as Henry Cornwall and wished me to apply to a Mr W H Jones living at No 13 Union-terrace Bag-sigge-wells-road for payment of 105l 14s which he aaid was due to him—did so and about ten days afterwards received a communication and afterwards received the amount through a banker s HENRY BARNES I ant an officer of Great Yarmouth In consequence of instructions given to me I took Attwell into custody at Messrs Reynolds and Palmer s office—I searched him and found on him these two I O U s and at his lodging I found these three letters and some bills—these are the three letters written by the three solicitors—I searched Hard-wicke s lodging he was then known by the name of Ralph—I there found a 1 000l Exchequer bill and a revolver pistol Hardwicke was further dwrged with having been before convicted SAMUEL COOK I produce a certificate from the clerk of the peace s office for the borough of Plymouth— This certified the conviction of William Hwdwicke alias Salt in April 1837 of larceny

t18561027-1028  1028 WILLIAM JAMES ROBSON was again indicted for feloniously forging and uttering a transfer of 50 shares and interest in the capital stock of the Crystal Palace Company MR SERJEANT BALLAXTINE with MESSRS BODKIN and HAWKINS conducted the Prosecution GEORGE SIDNEY CLEMENT I am a stock broker carrying on business in the City I am acquainted with the prisoner—he was in the habit of employing me in my business—in Jan last he employed me to sell 100 shares in the Crystal Palace Company—I sold them in the market to brokers—50 shares were sold to Mr Low and 50 to Mr Brandard—I received 295l for the 100 shares—I paid that to the prisoner—this produced is a transfer deed it was either sent or brought to me by the prisoner—I observe a signature to the execution of it by Mr Johnson the seller—I cannot swear to that handwriting—I am acquainted with the prisoner s handwriting it is rather like his—the signature of William Jas Robson is the prisoner s writing—this reached me at No 7 Bank-chambers I believe before I paid over to the prisoner the purchase money of those shares—I delivered that paper to the person to whom I sold the shares MR BODKIN proposing to read the transfer MR GIFFARD for the prisoner objected until the signature of the purchaser was first proved in the ordinary manner by calling the attesting witness GEORGE FOSSON I am treasurer and registrar of the Crystal Company I have the charter of incorporation here it is dated 28th Jan 1853—the prisoner was in the service of the Company—he entered the service in the early part of 1853 and continued in it till 17th Sept last—on 30th June 1854 he was appointed chief clerk in the transfer department at a salary of 150l a year—there are register books of the shareholders in the Company and a register book of the transfer of those shares—there is also a guard book in which the transfer deeds from time to time are posted so as to be preserved in the office of the Company—those books were under the charge of the prisoner as principal clerk in the transfer department—a certificate of proprietorship was in the first instance issued to each proprietor of shares—they were not all delivered out to the owners those that were not delivered out were returned by the Company until they were required by the owners—those certificates would be accessible to the prisoner they were not strictly under his care—on the morning of 17th Sept last a complaint of irregularity was made against the prisoner in the presence of Mr Grove the secretary—the irregularity was the passing of transfers through the books without a title in the transferror—this took place in my room at the Crystal Palace—upon that complaint being made the prisoner said that it did appear to be irregular but that he had the necessary transfers in his possession that would make it right—I asked him if he had them there—he said no they were at his private house which was at Kilburn—he offered to produce the transfers to me if I would accompany him to his private house and I went with him—when we arrived there he left the room into which we were shown two or three times apparently from observations he made with a view of getting papers together and the last time he left the room he did not return—I never saw him again until I saw him in custody at the police court at Lambeth about a fortnight or three weeks ago—after my visit to Kilburn I made search in the office that was occupied by the prisoner at the Crystal Palace—I made a partial search the next day and continued the search for some days—I cannot remember that I found this particular document—I know the prisoner s writing very well—the signature of the attesting witness to the name of Johnson is in the prisoner s handwriting—I have the register of shares in Court produced —these are the A shares—I have looked through this book myself—Henry Johnson is not registered on the A list of shareholders—this transfer applies to the A shares—I beg to correct my answer Henry Johnson is registered but not in respect of these shares he is described as of Birmingham contractor —he is not registered in respect of shares 145 052 to 145 101—the shares not called A and B shares are the original shares of 500l each—then there was a second issue of 250 000l A shares a third issue of 150 000l B shares and a fourth issue of 150 000l preference shares—a person who had shares transferred to him would deposit the deed of transfer at the office of the Company—it would be the prisoner s duty to see that the deed of transfer was properly registered on the books—I have before me an entry to the credit of Joseph Low s account of 50 shares numbered 145 052 to 145 101—the whole of that entry is in the prisoner s handwriting—there are two columns in the book one for the date of transfer of shares to the credit of the account and also a column for the number of transfer of shares to the credit of that account—the transfers are numbered consecutively—there is no entry of the date or number of the transfer of the 50 shares to Mr Low Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Is that the only register A This is the shareholders register—there was a numerical register—it is not in existence now it has fallen into disuse and has not been entered up—it is at the office of the Company—it has not been entered up for these two years—it was kept by one of the junior clerks in the office whoever was disengaged no one in particular—I have examined that recently—it was the immediate duty of the prisoner to see that the transfers were regularly registered I was the superior officer but I had several departments—at every general meeting of shareholders a register was made up purporting to be a complete statement of the shares—it appeared to be complete—I looked at the total—I did not go into all the details personally or add up the shares HENRY JOHNSON I am a contractor and builder living at Birmingham and am a connection of the prisoner s There is no other person of my name carrying on the same business at Birmingham—the signature of Henry Johnson to this deed is not mine—it is not my writing I never gave any person authority to write it Gross-examined Q Did nothing ever pass between you and the prisoner about your having shares in the Crystal Palace A Never—I am quit sure of that—there were some money transactions between us—I am quite positive that nothing was ever said about my consenting to take shares and transfer them to him—nothing was ever said about his using my name as a shareholder—nothing of the sort GEORGE GROVE I am Secretary of the Crystal Palace Company I believe I was at the Palace when a search was made in the office occupied by the prisoner—I cannot say that I saw any transfer of shares found in a closet there—I am well acquainted with the prisoner s handwriting—I believe this signature of Robson to be his writing—the signature of Johnson I also believe to be his writing SAMUEL COPPIN police sergeant P 15 I apprehended the prisoner on 7th Oct at Copenhagen—I said to him Well Mr Robson I have come to you with reference to this aflair at the Crystal Palace —he said Yes I know I am very sorry I have done wrong and I must suffer the law —I said Then are you willing to go back to London with me —he said yes he should be glad to get back—I said Then we will prepare to go —I then said Have you any money with you and I searched him—on our road home I told him I had been informed that he was 20 000l deficient at the Palace—he said no he did not think it was so much as that he thought it was about 10 000l if he had his papers and his books he should be able to tell me—I told him no doubt Mr Smith had got them and he would get them when he got to London GEORGE FASSON re-examined I have no doubt that the numbers on this document 145 052 to 145 101 are in the prisoner s handwriting MR GIFFARD again submitted that this document could not be read being incomplete by reason of the attesting witness to the signature of Law not being called MR JUSTICE ERLE was qf opinion that there was nothing in the objection the document was not tendered as a valid instrument but as an invalid one by reason of forgery and that part of it which was attested by the prisoner was a part in respect of which the crime was alleged to be committed the other part for the purposes of the present trial was entirely irrelevant The document being read purported to be a transfer from Henry Johnson to Joseph Low of fifty shares in the Crystal Palace Company MR GIFFARD to HENRY JOHNSON Q You say that nothing was said to you about taking shares in the Crystal Palace just be careful in your recollection and tell me whether something of this sort did not pass do you remember the prisoner saying that he did not wish his own name to be placed on the Stock Exchange and might he use yours A He never said that to me nothing to that effect—I never said You may do what you like I don t care —he did not say that he objected to his name being used on the Stock Exchange and might he use mine—nothing of the sort ever passed between us Q I am not asking whether it was proposed to you to be a participator in the forgery or fraud but whether he might take shares in your name A He never said that to me nor anything to that effect—I clearly understand what you mean—he never said anything to me about objecting to his name appearing on the Stock Exchange—I am quite positive of it—I do not remember his having a conversation with me about the Stock Exchange at all—I am sure that no such conversation took place MR GIFFARD submitted that the document in question was an incomplete instrument and therefore not a transfer as alleged by the indictment MR BODKIN stated that they had sent for die attesting witness at the same time he contended that such proof was unnecessary in the case qf the forgery of a transfer of the stock in the Bank of England the purchaser may not accept till long afterwards yet that would be undoubtedly a forgery of a transfer MR JUSTICE ERLE observed that in the ease of Bank Stock the transfer passed by the signature of the trantferror but in a chartered company the transferee did not obtain any interest in the company until he had executed the deed and obtained the registration of fa instrument MR BODKIN stated that there were counts calling it a deed and he submitted that this being a deed under seal was a perfect deed of Johnson s at the time he executed it MR GIFFARD urged that although it might be a deed as between the parties yet it was in reality a deed of transfer and in order to make it a deed of transfer its execution both by fa seller and purchaser must be regularly proved MR JUSTICE ERLE was of opinion that fa objection was answered it was clearly a deed and he should also hold it to be a transfer MR GIFFARD to HENRY JOHNSON Q You had borrowed money to a very considerable extent from the prisoner I believe A Yes I do not remember seeing him in Lombard-street I may have done so—I do not recollect seeing him there when something was said about the repayment of the money which I had borrowed—I cannot swear that it did not take place but I have no recollection of it—I do sot recollect his speaking to me about selling shares to enable him to repay the money that he had borrowed in order to lend to me—I will swear that nothing of that sort took place—I remember the last time on which the subject of my borrowing was mentioned—that was not in Lombard-street—I win swear that on that last occasion nothing was said about his not liking his name to appear on the Stock Exchange or on any occasion—I think I had borrowed about 700l or 800l of him—I have no recollection of seeing him at the telegraph office in Lombard-street I am not aware that there is a telegraph office there—I remember a considerable sum of money being telegraphed down to Birmingham by myself—I do not recollect the exact date of that I cannot say the date at all I think it was in 1854—it was not the beginning of 1855—I do not speak with great certainty about the date of 1854 it certainly wag not in 1855—H was not in Dec 1854—I telegraphed from London—I did did not telegraph any money—I sent a message to Birmingham to my clerk there respecting money for the payment of wages—I will swear that on that occasion nothing was said by the prisoner about not wishing his name to appear on the Stock Exchange—I am quite positive of it—I was not aware that the prisoner was going to transfer snares nothing was said about shares—I will swear that—I was not aware that my name was registered as a shareholder or that I was treated as a shareholder of the Crystal Palace I Company—I never heard of it until you mentioned it now—I was not aware that my name appeared on the register Q Can you give me any idea what it was that passed between you and Robson on that occasion when you sent that telegraphic message A I asked him if he could borrow me 100l which he did he borrowed it COURT Q Where was it that you asked if he could lend you 100l A At the telegraph office I think I will not be sure MR GIFFARD Q At the telegraph office in Lombard-street A Not in Lombard-street in Cornhill—when I asked him if he could do this he said he would endeavour to obtain it—I do not recollect that I then went to No 3 Adelaide-place London-bridge—I cannot recollect where I went to—raay have gone to Adelaide-place but I do not recollect I cannot say which way I went—I got the money from the prisoner in Corahill at the telegraph office—he did not pull the money out of his pocket when I asked him for it he went and got it and left me there—I have no letters or correspondence of his with me which would enable me to fix the date with certainty—I was certainly not aware of his being about to use my name on the Stock Exchange in lieu of his own MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Have you ever claimed any interest at all in any shares in the Crystal Palace Company A No I am not aware that any intercut has ever been claimed on my behalf—the prisoner and I are brothers-in-law GUILTY Aged 35 — Transported for Twenty Years to commence concurrently with tlie sentence upon the previous indictments There were other indictments against the prisoner Before Mr Common Serjeant and the Fourth Jury 
t18570105-232  232 LEOPOLD REDPATH was again indicted with CHARLES JAMES COMYN KENT for feloniously forging and uttering a transfer of 1 000l B stock and 87l B stock of the Great Northern Railway Company their masters with intent to defraud MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE with MESSRS BODKIN and GIFFARD conducted the Prosecution HENRY ATTERBURY I am a clerk in the audit office of the Great Northern Railway and have been lately attending to the registrar s department I produce a transfer No 16774 purporting to be of 1 087l 10s B stock from Stephen George Hammond to George Sidney dated 10th Feb 1855—the signature Stephen George Hammond is in full and is in Redpath s writing it is not witnessed at all—the attesting witness to Sidney s signature is Charles Kent—that is in the writing of the prisoner Kent—I produce the stock register No 22 at folio 133 I find an account of George Sidney s in the writing of a clerk named Corfield—he is described as of No 20 Edward-street Hampstead-road gentleman—his account here is credited with the amount mentioned in the transfer I have spoken of—I have got the stock register No 119—at folio 153 I find an account of Stephen George Hammond of Church-street Chipping Norton but a line is drawn through the address and it is altered to Barge-yard Bucklersbury—that account is debited with the same amount—the entry of the transfer is in Freeman s writing a clerk in the registry office—I produce the original transfer which came into the office on 10th Feb 1855—Hammond s account was then balanced—there was no dividend coming to him and Sidney had oversold his account to the extent of 2 315l —that reduced the overplus to 1 227l 10s —the total amount of A stock from Sidney is 7 625l and of B stock 5 525l as by the books but there are other transfers—here is a transfer No 19259 purporting to be from Leopold Redpath of Chester-terrace to the Rev Robert Spranger of 92l 10s five percent pre-ference shares redeemable at five per cent —there is no other five per cent preference stock except that—the date is 15th Nov 1855—the signature of Spranger is in Redpath s writing and is witnessed by Charles Kent in Kent s writing—here is another transfer No 19585 from the same to the same of 7l 10s in the same stock—the signature of Spranger is in Redpath s writing there is no attesting witness to that The COURT considered that after the verdict in the last case any evidence affecting Redpath alone ought not to be given as it could only affect Kent by way of prejudice the last transfer must therefore be struck out Q Look at No 19298 what is the date A 6th Nov 1855—that is a transfer of 95l five per cent preference shares of 7l 10s each making 712l 10s from Spranger to Wedgwood—the signature of Spranger is in Redpath s writing and is witnessed by Charles Kent in Kent s writing—No 19211 is a transfer from Spranger to Deane of 22l 10s on 27th Nov 1855—the name of Spranger is in Redpath s writing and the attesting witness is Charles Kent in Kent s writing—No 19212 is a transfer from Spranger to Proctor of 7l 10s on 27th Nov 1855—the signature of Spranger is in Redpath s writing—the attesting witness is Charles Kent and the signature is in Kent s writing—No 19470 is a transfer from Spranger to Jordan of 7l 10s on 30th Nov 1855—the signature of Spranger is in Redpath s writing—the attesting witness is Charles Kent that signature is in Kent s writing Cross-examined by MR HAWKINS with MR THOMPSON for Kent Q Is Hammond here A I believe he is I have seen him here this morning—these two transfers Nos 16774 and 16775 were cut out of some book—the two being pasted on one guard we were obliged to take the two out—they were not in the transfer book this morning—the transfer No 16774 is the subject of this indictment—No 16775 is annexed to it—those two papers were taken from the transfer book on the 7th of the present month by me—before the Magistrate the books themselves were produced—the books are here—the two documents were taken out because they were both pasted on one guard and I could not take the one Without destroying the validity of the other—my attention was not particularly directed to the other document—I will swear that—I did not know what it was—I do not know that Mr Redpath had a great deal of stock standing in different persons names—I swear that—I knew that he had stock standing in his own name—I did not know that he had stock standing in the name of Sidney—I did not know that there was such a name until I commenced the examination—these documents are cut out of a guard book—they are pasted into that book—I have gone through the transfers up to about No 19000—there are forty-nine transfers of Sidney s in the books thirty-three of one sort—all the signatures of Sidney s are in the same handwriting—I believe those signatures are not attested by fifteen or sixteen different persons— referring to the books here is one No 16776 attested by S G Hammond—I believe that is the person whose name has been referred to—I could not say whether this is Hammond s writing—I do not know his handwriting well not sufficiently well to be certain—I never saw him write—I believe it may be his but I would not undertake to swear one way or the other—I cannot tell without going through the transfers how many other attestations there are by Hammond—it will oocupy some time to do it—I never attested a signature—there are not clerks in the service of the Company who have attested the same signature—I never heard until this morning that there had been any forged signatures of Spranger s which Kent had attested— MR SERJEANT PARRY here stated that as regarded Redpath he should entirely abstain from any further examination of the witnesses the COURT having intimated an opinion that the evidence should be confined to matter relating to the case of Kent MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE stated that he would proceed as if Kent alone were on his trial —it may save time if I say that there are three entries at the commencement of this account purporting to be to the debit of this account which do not in any way relate to Sidney s account—No 17067 is a transfer from Rames to Wetherell and others Q Are there not at least thirty-three different transfers purporting to be executed by George Sidney in the same handwriting A There are in the books thirty-three transfers but they are not all Sidney s—No 17067 is a transfer that does not in any way relate to Sidney s account—the transfer number appears in his account it is Rames to Wetherell—No 16764 is the first to the debit of the account the attesting witness there is Stephen George Hammond—the next is No 16769 that is witnessed by S G Hammond—No 16770 is the next that is Hammond s—I have not gone through these transfers for the purpose of seeing who the attesting witnesses are—I was asked this question a month ago but I did not know that I should be called upon—No 16731 is witnessed by S G Hammond—No 492 is witnessed by Redpath—No 916 917 574 545 610 623 and 1073 are all witnessed by Redpath—No 16777 is attested by Cork ill that is the witness who was examined in the last case—that is a transfer from Sidney—No 2018 is witnessed by Corkill—No 2257 is witnessed by Redpath—Nos 2484 and 2485 are each witnessed by Redpath and also Nos 2550 2571 and 2643— The witness was requested to furnish the particulars of the remaining transfers before the dose of the case —I do not know that holders of stock in the Great Northern hold it in a great many different names Q Has it not been a matter of common talk in the office A Only with regard to one or two—with regard to one or two of the directors of the railway—I only know from what I have heard in the office that Mr Graham Hutchinson is the owner of 100 000l of stock in different names—I was repeatedly called on to register the transfers—I never registered any transfer from or to Sidney—the principal of that account is in Redpath s handwriting—prior to Redpath s being appointed registrar he was the clerk whose duty it was to enter the transfers—I am told so I do not know it of my own knowledge—apparently from the books Redpath was the owner of a considerable quantity of stock—I had never heard the name of Sidney mentioned in the office until I called attention to it I cannot tell how long that is ago—it was after I had began the examination of the A and B stock some time in the course of last summer—I have never posted one transfer purporting to be signed George Sidney—I have been in the service of the company since 1851—Redpath was the principal registrar—I cannot say what Kent was when I went there I did not pay any particular attention I do not know—he was undoubtedly under Mr Redpath—I do not know what his salary was—I had no means of knowing—I only know he was a clerk in the office—I know Hammond by sight only—he was occasionally at the offices of the company not frequently—he was not a clerk there—the occasions upon which I have Been him have been when he has come into the registration office to see Mr Redpath—I believe he was a friend of Mr Redpath s he used to come and ask for Mr Redpath—I heard of these transfers signed Spranger before this morning some time when the examination was going on at Clerkenwell—there was no transfer purporting to be signed by Spranger produced at Clerkenwell—I believe none was produced with reference to this prosecution until this morning—I pointed out Spranger s transfer to the officials at the office after I had been to Clerkenwell—I pointed them out to Mr Oakley and Mr Brenny and other clerks in the office—I had no reluctance to produce our documents at Clerkenwell—I heard objections made to their production—I had a request made to me to fetch those documents and it was refused on the part of the prosecution—I really had no power in it—as far as I know this is the first time Kent has had the opportunity of knowing the name of the attesting witnesses to these transfers—I cannot say whether they were studiously kept back from him at Clerkenwell—when the documents were asked for it was said on the part of the prosecution They shall not be fetched I said there would be no difficulty in fetching them because they were within five minutes of the place—there would have been no difficulty—I believe the observation was made that the only object of wanting the transfers was to know the names of the other gentlemen who had attested the documents—after that the prosecution refused to produce them—I have never attested any transfers not on any occasion either genuine or otherwise—I know nothing at all about the practice of the office with regard to the attestation—I cannot tell whether it is the practice to have a great number of them attested at the same time or whether it frequently happens that clerks are asked to attest genuine documents which they have never seen signed at all—I have never been in a stockbroker s office—Kent was considered a respectable young man at the office and very attentive to his duties—I knew where he lived—he has been recently married about eighteen months—he was living in a little cottage near Islington—he moved from there to one in Camden-town a less expensive place—from all the opportunity I had of observing him he appeared a steady attentive young man—I believe he was a very great favourite with all the officials he was with his fellow clerks—I do not know of my own knowledge that on one occasion he had a gratuity presented to him for good conduct and attention MR BODKIN Q Did you go through these accounts before the parties were taken into custody A I did that is with regard to the A and B stock—I went through Sidney s account—I stated both to Redpath and Kent what I had found with respect to Sidney s account—the Company s advisers were asked before the Magistrate to produce all the books and accounts of the Company from the year 1850 Mr Giffard the counsel for the prosecution answered that he would produce all documents relating to the charge but he must decline doing so as to any other STEPHEN GEORGE HAMMOND I live at No 46 Gower-place Eustonsquare I am not in any business or profession—I am twenty years of age—I am no relation of Mr Redpath s—I have lived at his house on and off for about two or three years—this transfer No 16774 purporting to be a transfer from me to Sidney is not in my handwriting—I do not know anything of that transfer—I never put any money into the Great Northern Railway Company—I did not receive any money for this transfer—I was educated by Mr Redpath for two years Cross-examined by MR HAWKINS Q Do you mean to say that you did not know there was stock standing in your name A I knew stock was in my name—he has told me that he had put stock in my name—he has told me that on several occasions Q Has he told you also that he had stock standing in the name of Sidney A I saw a transfer in the name of Sidney—I saw the signature of Sidney and I happened to say something about the likeness of the handwriting—he told me that he had stock standing in the name of Sidney—I do not remember his telling me so on more than one occasion—I could not swear that he did not tell me so on half a dozen different occasions—I have been asked to execute transfers—I have not refused to do so—I do not remember Mr Redpath ever telling me that he had signed transfers in my name—I could not swear he has not—I would not swear that he has not told me so a dozen times—if he had I think I should have remembered it—I could not say—I could not say he has not told me so a dozen times—I do not remember his ever telling me at all—I could not say that he has not told me a dozen times that he has signed transfers in my name—I was frequently at the offices of the Great Northern Railway—I used to go in to see Mr Redpath—it might have been about stock or shares it was not always—I do not remember exactly whether it was generally—I did not generally go there to see him about stock or shares particularly—I have been to see him about stock but not always—I could not swear whether I had been there 100 times to see him about stock—I could not swear to how many times I have been there—I was not a speculator in stock—I had some shares given me by Mr Redpath not in the Great Northern it was in a mining Company—I had no means of subsistence at all myself—Mr Redpath partly brought me up and educated me—he educated me from 1850 to 1852—I was in a mining office after that the one I had the shares in—I was not a promoter or director I was a clerk MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Have you been to see Mr Redpath since he has been in Newgate A No—I have not seen his attorney or his clerk—I have had no communication with Mr Redpath or his attorney since he has been committed—I have seen them in Court but had no communication with them—I have not been talking to them—I have not been subpœnaed by them but by Mr Humphreys ROBERT MAYMAN I have for the last twelve years lived at No 20 Edward-street Hampstead-road—there is no other No 20 in that street to my knowledge—no person named George Sidney has lived there since I have lived there—Red path lived there eight or nine years ago Cross-examined by MR HAWKINS Q Do yon know Hammond A I have some little knowledge of him—I saw him there once but he did not live there—I believe he used to visit Mr Redpath THE REV ROBERT JEFFREYS SPRANGER I am a Clergyman of the Church of England I live at Hursley—my father s name was Robert Spranger—he lived at Tointon in Lincolnshire—I have no stock in the Great Northern Railway—my father died in Feb 1850 JAMES RYDER MOWATT I am secretary to the Great Northern Railway Company Redpath was originally a clerk in the registration department and on the retirement of Mr Clark about three years ago having been chief clerk and book keeper he was appointed to succeed him—while he was principal clerk to Mr Clark the entry of the transfer of shares was I believe chiefly his duty—Kent was in those days second clerk in the office acting in concert with Redpath—since Redpath has been at the head of the office Kent has been chief clerk next to him—during any temporary absence of Redpath it was Kent s duty to superintend the business of that department Cross-examined by MR HAWKINS Q How many clerks are there in the same office A I think lately there were altogether five they were Redpath Kent Corkill Freeman and Flemming—I do not know where Redpath lived latterly—I was never on visiting terms with him—I never saw him lately out of the office—I do not know that the Directors were on visiting terms with him—I mean to swear that I am here on a serious occasion I will give yon all you choose to ask me on any subject whatever—Kent has been in the office for I believe seven or eight years and considering he was a youngster his conduct has during the whole of that time been uniformly good it was sometimes necessary to give him some good advice and being an old one I took the liberty of giving it to him—his conduct was tolerably good—I have not actually given him a gratuity for good services—one was presented under peculiar circumstances MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q What were the circumstances A It was considered some four or five years ago that it would be desirable to try and encourage good conduct among the servants generally by giving a per centage on the amount of dividend and with the concurrence of the proprietors that was done to all the servants indiscriminately who had a certain amount of salary on a certain day and he was included with them MR HAWKINS Q Did you know that Redpath was living in considerable style in the Regent s-park A No more than you did—I have heard of it—I only knew rather lately that he was the owner of a considerable amount of stock Cross-examined by MR TINDAL ATKINSON Q Is Redpath a bankrupt A Yes—I have been appointed assignee of the estate—I believe it has been valued by the official assignee—I really do not know the amount The attestation to the transfer was here read as follows Signed sealed and delivered by the above named George Sidney in the presence of Charles Kent King s Cross MR HAWKINS to STEPHEN GEORGE HAMMOND Q Just take that in your hand transfer No 14769 is that your writing A Yes—Nos 14770 and 16776 are mine also Kent received a most excellent character REDPATH — GUILTY — Transported for Life KENT — NOT GUILTY There were three other indictments against Kent upon which no evidence being offered an acquittal was taken there were also other indictments against Redpath 
t18570302-413  413 JAMES TOWNSHEND SAWARD and JAMES ANDERSON were indicted for feloniously forging and uttering an order for the payment of 100l with intent to defraud SIR FREDERICK THESIGER with MESSRS BODKIN and SLEIGH conducted the Prosecution HENRY ATWELL I am at present a prisoner in Newgate under sentence of transportation for life—I was convicted here a few Sessions since of the crime of forgery with a person of the name of Hardwicke—I know Saward and Anderson—I became acquainted with Saward first—I was introduced to him by a person of the name of Saunders a scalemaker and smith in the Old-street road—it is now turned twelve months back since that introduction took place—it was in the year 1855—it is now about thirteen months back I think—I had at that time in my possession three cancelled cheques and two blank cheques—I received them from a person I believe they came from a burglary—they were afterwards torn up—they were drawn on Barclay s bank by a person in Brick-lane of the name of Doe I think—I had some conversation with Saunders on the subject of those cheques in consequence of which I appointed to meet him again and did meet him again soon afterwards at his own house—Saward was present when I met him the second time—I had never seen Saward before—Saunders gave me the cheques that I had left with him and then I showed them to Saward Saunders said That is the person I mentioned to you —Saward and I had some very trifling conversation inside I came out with him from Saunders s and he asked me then if I knew where they came from I told him I believed they came from a burglary at a person s of the name of Doe in Spitalfields he said he should like to know where the person was and who he was and if I would go with him he should feel obliged—I went with him as far as Doe s place—before we went there Saward said that the two cheques that were not cancelled were to be filled up to be forged—he said he had a man who he called his sender who would send them to the bank when they were filled up—Mr Doe s premises are in Brick-lane Spitalfields—on seeing the premises he said that it was a very small place he did not think he should be able to get much money from them—I then left him—I gave the cheques to Saward—he took them all five—I had an appointment to meet him a short time afterwards and he met me and told me that he had them all ready on a certain day—on the day that we went to see Doe s premises I made an appointment to meet him another time I met him to the best of my belief a little above Old—street road first that was the time before before the cheques were sent and I then had an appointment to meet him in the New-road Spitalfields to the best of my belief where he then introduced the two cheques that I had given him in blank filled up—it was on the second occasion that be brought the cheques—I believe those produced to be the two cheques that were in blank and which he brought to me on the second occasion that I met him—when he produced them he said he had filled them up and he showed me the three that were cancelled to compare with the two that he had filled up he asked me if I thought they were a very good imitation—I said Yes to the best of my belief I looked at them all—after I had examined and compared the three cancelled cheques with the other two he said these were of no use and we tore them up The two cheques were here ready they were dated 9th and 10th Jan and were for 46l 15s 6d 95l 17s 6d and were signed J B Doe jun payable at Barclay s —after the other cheques had been destroyed I went into the neighbourhood of Leman-street Whitechapel with Saward three other persons were with him—one of them was Anderson whom he called his sender and two other persons not in custody—we then went into a house near Leman-street where Anderson bad taken lodgings and wrote a letter to some person—I did not go into the house—Anderson went in no one else—he told me he had written a letter for a person to come—this was on the day that the cheque was sent to the bankers—the lodging was taken and the letter was written unbeknown to me—he told me that be bad done it before it was not done that day—he did not say where he had written it to he said he had written it to a man who advertises generally in the papers for a situation—whilst we were in Leman-street a young man came to the same house were the lodgings were taken—I do not know his name I should know the young man— The witness Draper was here called in —I believe that is the young man that came there that morning—when he came Anderson was to give him this cheque to go to the bankers I was to follow him there to see whether the money was paid I did so and saw the money paid—it was the smallest cheque of the two for 40l odd—I saw him receive the money at Barclay s—when he had received the money he came straight down to Leman-street—I followed him back to the lodging—the arrangement made by Anderson was that a man who went with me to know whether the money was paid was to run back and tell him Anderson would not be in the lodging at the time be would come out after he had given the man the cheque and he was to go back and tell him whether the money was paid—I sent a message through that man that the money was paid—when I got back to Leman-street I found Anderson in the house—the money was given to Anderson I believe he brought it out with him—the young man then went away—I did not hear anything said to him by Anderson—I and Anderson then went to a public house in the neighbourhood of Spitalfields and stopped some little time and had a glass of something to drink and from there we went to the Eastern Counties Railway where he proposed to meet another person to take the other cheque—that was the same day—Saward was with us all day—when I returned on the cheque being paid Saward was in Leman-street not with Anderson Anderson was inside and Saward outside—we all joined and went together to the Eastern Counties—the money was given to Saward by Anderson before we went to the Eastern Counties—the gold was shared and the notes were given to Saward—there were five of us there Anderson Saward and two other persons—one man they commonly called Fred and the other Tom I do not know them by any other names—the notes were given to Saward—he said he would keep them until the other cheque was sent to see if it was paid—we then went to the Eastern Counties Railway—I there saw another young man—I do not know his name—I should know him— Edward Brown was here called in —that is the young man—Anderson spoke to him took him into a sort of public house and there gave him a cheque for 90l odd—he was to take it to the bankers and get it cashed as the other man had done—at this time Saward was waiting outside in the neighbourhood I followed this young man to the banking house as I had done the other—the cheque was paid and I followed the young man back—at first he was going over London Bridge instead of going back to the Eastern Counties—I went and tapped him on the shoulder and told him I thought he was going the wrong way—he said that he was only going over to his master to inquire about his character he did not mean anything dishonest—he turned round and came the right way and gave the money to Anderson right opposite Spital-square—I can hardly say whether it was in the street or whether Anderson took him into a house if it was in a house it was just round the corner—I think he did take him into a house but I saw him give him the money—I saw Saward there he was on the opposite side of the way—as Anderson was coming down one side Saward was coming down on the other—I had sent a message this time the same as before to say that it was all right—we then went into the neighbourhood of the Hackney-road—we went into a public house and Saward took the notes to try and dispose of them for gold to sell them I mean the last notes as well as the first—he said he would go and try and sell them to a person that he knew—he mentioned a person of the name of Hall to the best of my belief—I do not recollect Hall s Christian name being mentioned—Saward left us for that purpose and took the notes with him—he was gone about an hour or an hour and a quarter—when he came back he brought us so much gold for the notes—I believe the cost of them was about 8l 10s for each of the 10l notes—we then shared the money—it was put up in sixes—there were five of us there—I took a share for bringing the papers and that I gave the person of the name of Saunders a part of for the introduction—I had somewhere about 30l or 40l I think—I had two shares because I had the papers—we then separated—Saward told me if I should ever have anything of that kind I was to let him know and he said he would let me know—I gave him my address where I lived in Cottage-lane and he said he would write to me or I might always find him through Mr Saunders—he did not give me his address at the time—I was then living in Cottage-lane—I went by the name of Hawkes—a female was living with me as my wife—her name is Elizabeth Evans I believe—I lived with her a little better than two years I think—I have an aunt of the name of Elizabeth Haydon—she occasionally used to visit me at Cottage-lane—Saward came to me in Cottage-lane about two months after the transaction at Barclay s I think or it might be less I cannot speak to the time—I saw him more than once there I believe—I saw him twice in Cottage-lane—I remember the presentation of the cheque at Smith Payne and Smith s—he called at my place on that day—he said that he had some business on hand and if I wished to join in as I had done before I could come which I agreed to do—he showed me some cheques— looking at some these are them—they are nine cancelled cheques—they are signed by a person of the name of Ash—he also showed me this one looking at it —this is a cheque for 91l on the same bankers and in the same name of Ash—he said that was to be sent to the bankers in the same way of business as the one to Barclay s—I compared this with the cancelled cheques and said I thought it appeared very perfect—he did not tell me then how he had got these cheques but I believe I heard afterwards how they were got they were the produce of a burglary—he told me that there was a place taken in Oakley-crescent City-road I think—he said the same person as before was going to present this cheque Anderson the sender and I was to follow the man to the bankers in the same way—he left the cancelled cheques at my place for me to take care of—I then met Anderson out in the road—Saward was with me—we all went to a public house in the neighbourhood of the City-road and then Anderson dressed up for the occasion as he used to do—he wore a wig sometimes he would wear whiskers and sometimes not—I did not go with him to Oakleycrescent—I was waiting in the neighbourhood—I saw a young man come there— The witness Humphreys was here called in —I believe he looks something like the young man—he went to the lodging in Oakley-crescent where Anderson was—he was sent at first on some errand to the railway at Camden Town—I waited in the neighbourhood until lie came back—Anderson went into the lodging before he returned—the young man then came out and went in the direction of the City—I followed him—I saw him present the cheque at Smith Payne and Smith s—it was not paid—on that I came back and met the other persons who were outside—I sent them on and then I came on myself and told them it was stopped— The cheque was here read dated 21 Feb 1856 for 91l drawn by Charles F Ash on Smith Payne and Smith —at the time these nine cancelled cheques were deposited with me by Saward I was in the front room of my house in Cottage-lane—I then had the whole of that house—Elizabeth Evans came into the room whilst this was being done—a sheet of paper was left at the same time—this produced is it—I received it from Saward at the same time— This was stated to be a sheet of blank cheques upon the North Western Bank of England —they all continued in my custody for some time—Saward asked me to take care of them they would come in very useful—I gave the cancelled cheques and this sheet of paper to Elizabeth Evans to take care of them for me to put them where I might know where to find them at any time—they continued under her care until I was taken into custody—after this Saward left a letter with my brother one evening stating that I was to meet him—I did meet him—I believe he called at my place the next morning and told me that he had received a book of cheques from a banker s at the corner of the Haymarket which they had sent for that they had taken some lodgings and they wished me to go and follow the young man to the banker s as I had done before with some of the cheques out of that book I agreed to that—I followed three young men each with a separate cheque—one was sent from the neighbourhood of Park-street Camden Town and the other two from the neighbourhood of St John s Wood-lodgings were taken for the purpose in the same way as before— The witness Bowells was here called in —I cannot say that that is the young man that went from Park-street—I have no doubt he is but I cannot swear it I cannot call his features to mind—soon after this I saw Saward about a bill of exchange—I remember a lodging being taken in Cumberland-street Hackney-road—Saward said that he had a bill ready filled up which he wished to try upon the bankers and I was to go with them and get a lodging—I met them against Shoreditch Church Saward Anderson and another person—Anderson went and took a lodging in Cumberland-street—I waited in the neighbourhood—Saward did not show me the bill that day—he did the next day—I believe this to be the bill— This was a bill for 386l 17s 10d dated Jan 15 1856 at three months payable to W F Jennings and Co addressed Samuel Dobree 6 Tokenhouse-yard London accepted at Hankers for Samuel Dobree and Sons Thomas Gray —this bill was sent from Cumberland-street by Anderson—he was then dressed the same as he usually was with a wig—I do not know whether he had false whiskers then or not—the young man was despatched from there with that bill—that is the young man looking at Wigzell —I followed him to Hankey s bank and saw him present the bill—it was not paid—upon that I went to a coffee house in Shoreditch where I found Saward and Anderson—I told them the bill was not paid and we separated—I had seen something written on the back of the bill that day in the coffee house by Saward before it was sent—the bill was detained it did not come back—I do not know exactly what it was that Saward wrote it was some little trifling thing—the date of the month was generally put to them on the day they were dated making them due that day otherwise if they were dated before I have heard him say they would not be payable at all provided they were negligent as to the date—I believe he wrote nothing except the day of the month—In April last I went to the office of Mr Turner a solicitor in Bed lion-square—that was in consequence of an arrangement made by Saward myself Anderson and another person—Saward gave me an I O U which I was to take to Mr Turner and give him instructions to write for payment for the purpose of getting a cheque of Mr Turner s after the money was paid—I went to the office with the I O U and instructed Mr Turner or his clerk to proceed to recover the payment of that money—I described myself to Mr Turner as Mr Hunter—Saward suggested that name to me—he said as the debt I applied for was under 50l I might give the name of Hunter that Mr Turner should write the letters Hun which would be half of the word Hundred and so get the cheque from him in order to forge others—Mr Hesp was the name of the supposed debtor—I do not recollect the address I know the place very well it is in the neighbourhood of the New-road—Anderson took a lodging there for the purpose of having the letters to Mr Hesp addressed there—I advanced I think 40l in money for the payment of this debt—my brother took it to Mr Turner s—I gave it to him—a few days afterwards I called at Mr Turner s and his clerk paid me the money in cash—I saw Saward afterwards and told him—he said We cannot help it it must stand over till another time we must try it again —About this time I became acquainted with Hardwicke—Saward first mentioned Hard-wicke to me—he told me that he had an old friend of his that he had known many years that he was going to meet him and he would introduce me to him that he had come from Australia and had some business to do—I went with Saward and Anderson to Farringdon-market and met Hardwicke—we went into a public house and had a glass of something to drink and some little conversation passed between us about having some papers—we met again that same evening at a house in the Southwark-bridge-road Hardwicke Saward Anderson and myself—we had something to drink and we had something to eat that evening—they had no cooked victuals in the house—we asked the landlord whether he had anything cooked he said No but he would send out and get us something he did so and got some boiled beef ready cooked in consequence of that we always called that house The beef house —we met several times afterwards at that house Hardwicke being one of the party—on one occasion of our being there Hardwicke produced this bill looking at one with some others all the other persons were present when he produced it he had some blank forms that he had brought from Australia and a forgery was to be committed by copying this the bill and the other papers were given to Saward these produced are some of the blank forms this one was in blank—the whole of the papers were given to Saward—Saward afterwards told me that he had the bills ready to present at the bankers we were then at the same house the beef house—we were all present—he did not produce any that evening he told me there were two bills one for 1 000l and I believe the other was to be for 900l but I saw nothing of them on that occasion—I saw the 1 000l bill on the morning it was presented at the bank—this is it produced — The 200l bill was here read it was dated Hobart Town Feb 16 1856 payable to the order of Mr William Crosby and Co at Messrs Heywood s The 1 000l bill was dated Hobart Town Jan 18 1856 payable to the order of Mr F R T Riley at Heywood and Co s with the following receipt written on it Received per Heywood and Co F R Riley —About this time I happened to be at a hatter s in Bread-street Cheapeide with Hardwicke and Anderson—whilst we were there a young man came in to ask if they knew of a situation— the witness Clemence was here called in —that is the young man—he was told that they did not know of one and he went out—Hardwicke followed him out and spoke to him—he came back and told us that the young man was out of a situation and that he was a very likely man to suit Anderson to go to the bankers to take the bill that was to be presented—this was told to Saward—Saward was not there at that time I believe we met in the evening at the beef house as we called it it was there arranged that a letter should be addressed to this young man and I believe Hardwicke went to him and left a letter at his house—an apartment was taken in a turning out of the Kingsland-road—Anderson there assumed the name of Riley—we met that morning at a public house in Old-street—road afterwards we met in Inglefield-road—we got there rather early I suppose about 9 o clock in the morning—I believe the sign of the house was the Inglefield Arms but I am not positive I know it was some Arms—it is a largish house with a small bit of grass plot in front and stabling and coach house at the back—the rooms were not ready for customers and a female came in to make some apology about the house being dirty and not being cleared up—Hardwicke produced a 20l note at that house pen and ink was brought by the servant I believe or a female Hardwicke gave it to Saward and he wrote an address upon it—this is the note produced —this is what Saward wrote R Riley No 2 De Beauvoir-place Kingsland-road —that was the place where the lodgings were taken by Anderson in the name of Riley—Clemence was to go into the City to get the note cashed it was a sort of trial to see whether he was capable of going right for the 1 000l bill—he was sent to get the note changed and to bring two 10s bill stamps from the City—Clemence came there and was dispatched with the note—I saw him return he brought the two stamps with him—Anderson sent Clemence out I believe to go and get some refreshment while he brought the stamps to Saward—we were still at the public house Saward took one of the stamps and placed it on the back of the 1 000l bill and wrote the address across the stamp—the change for the 20l note was given to Anderson and he gave it to Hardwicke it was Hardwicke s note the other 10s stamp was given to me to take care of—I kept it it was in my pocket book this is it produced —when the stamp was put on and the 1 000l bill was ready Anderson took it from the public house—he was then dressed and had his wig on—Clemence was sent with the bill—I followed him I rode down on the same bus with him to the City—Hardwicke and Saward also went in the neighbourhood of the banking house not to the bank—Anderson was to wait at a public house in Bishopsgate churchyard or passage whilst the bill was being presented—Clemence went to Heywood s bank I do not know whether it is in Lombard-street it is on the same side of the way as the Mansion House in King William-street I think—I saw him go in with the bill—Saward was at that time waiting under the clock right opposite not the clock that sticks out but the one under the archway in King William-street near the old Post-office—Hardwicke followed the young man into the banking house—soon after Hardwicke came out and gave me a sort of signal and I went in directly after him—I saw that the money was stopped it had been paid to the young man by the appearance but I could see by the finish of it that the money was being taken back—I then came out and went away with Saward and Hardwicke—I saw Saward outside in the passage—I went to him and told him that the money was not paid and we all went to Anderson at the public house in Biahopsgate Churchyard where he was supposed to be waiting till our return—we waited there some little time and then separated—after this I employed Mr Turner again in the same way as before—I think T went there on the Monday as the bill foiled on the Saturday—we met at a public house I believe in Duke-street Lincoln s Inn-fields to arrange the second application to Mr Turner—Anderson myself Saward and Hardwicke were there and another person who had the blanks those that were written out forged—an I O U was then written—I cannot call to my recollection now the name of the supposed debtor in that case there have been so many different names—I believe Hart was the name—I went to Mr Turner s and gave instructions in the same way the debt was 103l I think I cannot tell exactly—a lodging was taken by Anderson for the supposed Mr Hart in the New-road near St Pancras Churc—a few days after the 103l was advanced by Hardwicke—he sent it to Mr Turner by some person—a few days after it had been sent I called at Mr Turner s—I still kept the name of Hunter—they told me that the debt had been paid but Mr Turner was not within when I called in the morning—on calling again I got a cheque this is it produced and this is the receipt I signed— The cheque teas dated June 24th 1856 on Gosling and Sharp for 103l 8s 10d signed Alfred Turner The receipt was of same date and signed H Hunter —Mr Turner wrote me the cheque and I brought it out and gave it to Saward—he took it away for a short time and brought it back in about an hour and a half to the public house in Duke-street—he did not produce any other cheque at that time he said he would get the blank cheques from the person who had them that was the person who was with him that morning but he had not got them with him—I was told that those cheques were got out of Mr Turner s pocket book by robbery—Saward returned me the cheque that I had received from Mr Turner I took it to the banker s and got the money I received a 100l note I gave it to Havdwicke it was his money—About this time several letters were written to persons who advertised for situations among them was one near Moruington-crescent—I saw the young man that came there—Anderson had taken a lodging there I do not remember in what name just now he was to meet him at the University Hotel in Tottenham Court Road I do not remember the day—I and Anderson and Saward met together the first thing that morning at a public house in the neighbourhood of the New-road Hardwicke waiting in the neighbourhood of the banking house to see whether the young man came because it was some distance—Saward produced a cheque—I believe this to be the one— This was a cheque for 410l 7s 4d dated 28th June 1856 on Gosling and Sharp signed Alfred Turner —the cheque was given to Anderson to give to the young man to take to the bank—I was to watch the young man to the bank—I saw the young man leave the University Hotel and go to the bank—I followed him— the witness Hardy was called in —I believe that to be the young man—Hardwicke went inside the banking house whilst the young man was there I did not go in—it had been arranged that if the young man came out I was to follow him—I followed him back to Mornington-crescent as he was going along he was stopped by Anderson and I saw him hand the money to Anderson I did not hear what passed—we subsequently met at a public house near the Haymarket Theatre I Anderson and Saward and the other man that was with us Hardwicke was not there—we waited some time for Hardwicke but he did not come we then went to a coffee house in the neighbourhood of the Blackfriars-road I do not remember the sign it was leading up the Elephant and Castle way in the same road Saward said he knew where he could find Hardwicke if he was at home and he went and fetched him—eight 50l notes were then produced and some gold the difference of the cheque for 410l 17s 4d —Hardwicke had the notes he gave cash for them at the time he gave 35l for each 50l note—the money was divided into five parts for me Saward Anderson Hardwicke and the other person not in custody he had a share because he found the three blank cheques he had produced them and given them to Saward he had them from Mr Turner he picked his pocket I believe he was considered entitled to a fifth share—Hardwicke and I then went to Hamburg with the 50l notes and got them changed there—In Aug last I remember a transaction of the same kind at Hankey s bank Hardwicke received a check from some one who I do not know for a small amount of money he showed it to Saward Saward said that he had some blanks which would fit it—we met by appointment at the house in Bishopsgate-churchyard where we had met before I Saward Hardwicke and Anderson attended that meeting it was on a Saturday—Saward then produced some cheques looking at three cheques one for 60l and two for 100l signed Daniel Baldwin —these are what he produced—he said that Anderson was to take them one of them which he gave him first for 50l to the White Hart in Bishopsgate street and send the boots from there with it—the did so—Saward was to be at the Magpie in Bishopsgate-street—we all four went to the Magpie and there arranged our business in the back parlour—I was to watch the man to the banker s as I did before I do not know his name—I should know the young man that is him looking at Mitchenton —I went to the banker s after him—I did not see the cheque paid Hardwicke saw the first cheque paid I was outside the bank—I saw the young man come out and followed him back—when I got to the Magpie Anderson and Saward were there—we told them that the cheque was paid and Anderson went over to the White Hart and received the money from the young man and brought it over to the Magpie it consisted of three 10l notes and the rest in gold—I took those three 10l notes to Mr Baum s in Leadenhall-street and got Napoleons for them—I wrote the name of Hunter on the back of the notes—these are them produced —I brought the Napoleons back to the Magpie Saward Anderson and Hardwicke were there—I gave the gold to Saward—another cheque for 100l was then given to Anderson one of these to go to the Four Swans and the porter of the Four Swans was sent with it by Anderson I followed him and saw that it was paid the other cheque was not sent that day it was too late—we had 150l that day altogether—Hardwicke took a portion of the notes that were received for the 100l cheque at 8l 10s each note—the money was equally shared among us Saward taking a portion something more than the rest for finding the blanks as he called them—we met again on the Monday against Gregory s Hotel in Cheapside it was arranged that the other 100l cheque should be sent from there—I did not go into Gregory a myself no one but Anderson went in there we went to a house somewhere at the bottom of Wood-street Cheapside I do not know the sign of the house but it is something of a booking office as well as a public house it was arranged that I and Hardwicke were to go and watch the young man who took the 100l cheque from Gregory s— looking at Richard Sounders I believe that is the young man—we went to the public house in Wood-street before the cheque was sent me Anderson Saward and Hardwicke were there—I believe some money was given to me there money passed to me it was Hardwicke s money I believe Hardwicke gave it to me—Saward was present it was 50l —I cannot say who gave me the money but Saward was present whether I received it out of Saward s hands or Hardwicke s it was Hardwicke s money I know they were both present—it was given to me for the purpose of going into the banker s with so that if I was asked what business I had there I should pay in that money to go into the country upon the cheque being stopped—Anderson took the 100l cheque and the young man took it from Gregory s Hotel it was not paid—I directly returned to Wood-street—I found Anderson and Saward there—I told them what had happened—Soon after this I went to Yarmouth with Hardwicke he had a cheque on a bank there—Saward was aware of our going to Yarmouth—Hardwicke went somewhere about a week before I did I joined him there—he went by the name of Ralph I went by the name of Attwood—at Yarmouth I employed several solicitors to write for debts as I had Mr Turner I went to Yarmouth for that purpose—I went to the offices of Mr Chamberlain Messrs Reynolds and Palmer and Mr Preston and to Miller and Son of Norwich—the names of the debtors in London to whom I directed them to write were I believe Mr Dixon and Mr Jones—Anderson had arranged to take places in London to receive the letters that should be sent— looking at three letters I received these letters from Saward in London I came up to London with Hardwicke to pay the money into the banker s here—I went and paid in some at the Royal British Bank in Threadneedle-street and I believe Anderson paid in some money at Barclay s I did not see him pay it in he went with Hardwicke—he told me when he came back that he had paid it in it was something over 100l for the debts—upon that day we dined together at the bottom of Queen-street I Saward Anderson and Hardwicke we had some chops and potatoes for dinner I think it was on a Thursday or Friday but I cannot say—on that occasion I saw Saward write these three letters producect he wrote them in my presence we were all four together—these letters were sent to the persons at Yarmouth and Norwich—soon after this I was taken into custody WILLIAM SALT HARDWICKE I am now a prisoner in Newgate under sentence of transportation for life Many years ago I was sentenced to a term of transportation for felony from Brecon I expiated a crime that I never committed I was transported to Van Diemen s Land—I established myself in business at Hobart Town—after the expiration of my term of transportation I returned to England and continued to return about every three years—I have known Saward from twenty-four to twenty-six years perhaps a little longer I cannot confine myself to a year or two—I had known him some years previous to my first conviction for felony—on my occasional visits to this country from Van Diemen s Land I used to see Saward from time to time—this day twelve months I took my passage at Melbourne and arrived here on 26th May last—I and my wife took lodgings in Nelson-square Blackfriars-road—shortly afterwards I met Saward in Suffolk-street Borough—he met me with astonishment and asked me how long I had been in England—I said some time I did not satisfy him at first how long I had been here—he said How is it you have never called upon me —I said I never intended to call from the manner in which you have treated me I never intend to call upon you again —he said Oh never mind old fellow we will pay up all arrears and we will go together and get some money I will put your passage money into your pocket again —we drank together and next day or a few days after I met him by appointment in Farringdon Market—he said that he would introduce me to the parties that he was then working with I did not know their names at that time—I was introduced to them in June in Farringdon Market and we afterwards drank together at the Coach and Horses I was introduced to Anderson and Atwell—Atwell was known by the name of Hawkes at that time he was called Harry Anderson was called Bob —I subsequently met Anderson and Atwell at a house in Guildford-street Southwark which we called the beef house—when I came from Australia I brought with me a bill of exchange for 200l and others this is one of them produced —I had about l 200l in Treasury bills and I had some blank forms of bills with me—I had to draw on a house for 100l and took the blank forms with me but when I arrived there they had got the bills already drawn to accommodate me so that I should not be delayed in going on board the ship so I brought the blank bills to England with me—I met Saward at the beef house and showed him what I had and he said he thought some business might be done with them we could go into business—I gave him the bill to take a copy from it for the purpose of taking Stephen s name off—I saw him on the following day and he returned me the bill saying he had done what ho wanted—I then paid the bill into Coutts s Q In the course of conversation between you Saward and Anderson what plan was to be adopted for the purpose of making use of the acceptances which he forged A I was to find the money for out of pocket expenses and Anderson was to be the sender that is the sender of the forged bills and Atwell was to be implicated to watch what took place—that was the plan arranged upon between us—shortly after this plan was arranged I went with Anderson and Atwell to Townsend the hatter s in the neighbourhood of Cheapside to purchase a large sized hat—Anderson was trying on the hat—Saward was not there he was not in our company that morning—a young man named Clemence came into the shop to inquire for employment—after seeing that young man I told Saward that a very likely young man had been into the hatter s shop seeking for employment and that I had got his address—Saward and I arranged that when the bill was ready and we were to go into the transaction on the Saturday following this young man was to be written to to be engaged by Anderson—the taking the apartment was left to Anderson and Atwell—Saward had arranged with them to go and take the lodging for the purpose—I believe a lodging was taken for that special purpose somewhere by the De Beauvoir-road I never went there—Saward met me in the Borough and we went to the Kingsland-road—I think that was on a Saturday morning 14th June—we went into a public house on that occasion it was an old fashioned public house for Anderson to change his dress that was to put on his wig and whiskers—I do not remember the name of that public house—I had never been there before I am speaking of where we first met that was at the Sussex Arms in the house where we went afterwards in the Inglefield-road—I am confounding myself—previous to his taking the lodging he had dressed at a public house in Kiogsland-road but on this occasion he dressed at the Sussex Arms in the Inglefield-road—that was about 9 o clock in the morning—we had some brandy and milk there—the landlady apologised for the room not being ready having had company the evening previous but I got the newspaper from her and I held the newspaper and pen and ink was called for—I had a 20l note with me—I gave it I think into Anderson s hands but Saward put the name and address upon it across the nice of the note—I believe this is the note looking at it —that note was given to Clemeuce its I understand but I did not see it given—the change was handed over to me when he came back 19l and two 10s stamps—Anderson gave the stamps to Saward he pasted one on the back of the 1 000l bill and filled up the date on the bill— looking at it this is the portion written by Saward—that bill was afterwards given to Clemence for the purpose of being taken to Heywood s—I went to Hey wood s and saw Clemence go in—I saw the money paid and the last of the sovereigns put into the bag—after the sovereigns were put in it was taken from Clemence s hand and put on one side of the counter—in consequence of that I came out and made a signal and motioned Atwell to go in—Saward was waiting under the old Post Office-passage in Lombard-street by the clock—he was made aware of what had occurred and he went off directly to tell Anderson that it had failed—we afterwards went into a public house in Bishopsgate-churchyard and dined—upon a Monday soon afterwards I Saward Anderson and Atwell met in reference to another transaction that was about Mr Turner s matter—Saward said that they had failed in the first instance in getting Mr Turner s signature not having sufficient money but would I advance a further sum say 100l or so for another application to be made to Mr Turner and let the money remain a few days in his hands so that it should be paid into his bankers and get his cheque—I advanced 104l I think—we met in reference to that matter at a public house in Duke-street Lincoln s Inn-fields—an I O U was written on that occasion by Saward and given to Atwell—on the day when Atwell was to go to Mr Turner s office we were all in Kingsgate-street waiting for him—Mr Turner was not in at the first application—myself Anderson Atwell and Saward were standing in Kingsgate-street in front of the house when Mr Turner passed by and Saward said That is Mr Turner —in a few minutes Atwell followed him into his office—he brought a cheque out with him and it was given to Saward to take the signature from—I consented for him to take the cheque away it was my money and do what was necessary with it to take a fac simile of the signature—I was not at that time engaged with any person in reference to some blank cheques on Gosling s—I do not know the party at all I have seen him—Anderson and Saward were the parties that had this man with the blank cheques—on Saturday 28th June we all met at a public house near St Pancras Church—that was the day on which it was arranged to utter one of the cheques—a cheque for 410l 7s 4d purporting to be signed by Mr Turner was given to a young man and sent to the bank—I went to the bank myself—I went inside and saw the cheque presented—I was making inquiry about a dishonoured bill drawn by a Mr Richards—that was merely to take the clerk s attention—I saw the money paid and the man leave the place—I afterwards sought to meet Saward and Anderson but I forgot the house where I was to meet them and I went home and from there I went to a Mrs Dixon s a cousin of mine in Union-street Borough-road they have the care of St Michael s Chapel—I said if the elderly gentleman that used to call on me should call and ask for me to say I had been waiting for him but I had gone home—on coming out of the gate I met Saward—he said It is all right old boy where have you been to —he took me to a coffee shop where the rest of the party were waiting Anderson Atwell and the man that had brought the cheque—on that occasion there was a division of the produce of the forged cheques—I purchased the 50l notes at the request of Saward—Saward put the price upon them and I found the gold to pay—I gave 35l each for the 50l notes it was all paid in gold—shortly after that I and Atwell went to Hamburg and there I changed the notes—I was away about seven or eight days—shortly after my return a cheque on Messrs Hankey s signed by Mr Baldwin fell into my possession—I was going into the City to get it cashed and I showed it to Saward—he said that he could fit it meaning that he had got similar cheques—he said he could fit it he had other cheques of the same description I left the cheque in his possession—I cannot say whether it was returned the same day or the following but I had it returned in an envelope—I met Saward shortly after—I do not at this moment recollect at what particular house—we were in the habit of meeting at the Magpie and Stump but we had so many meetings that I got confused with the different places—an arrangement was come to between Saward and myself with reference to some cheques upon Hankey s—he said as he could fit the cheque he should send in some cheques for money—he showed me three cheques prepared for that purpose one for 50i and two for 100l each—on that Saturday two of those cheques were sent to be cashed by a young man one from the White Hart in Bishopsgate-street—I went to Messrs Hankey s as I had gone to the previous bank and saw the first cheque paid—Saward Anderson and I were at different places that day—we did not part till the 100l cheque was paid—I subsequently had an interview with Anderson and Saward on the subject at the Magpie and Horseshoe or the Magpie and Punchbowl in Bishopsgate-street—we made an arrangement to meet on the Monday—we met on Monday at Gregory s Hotel I think they call it in Cheapside under an archway—the other cheque was presented for payment that day—I had two of the 10l notes the proceeds of the cheques and Saward had two—I paid 8l 10s each for them in gold—I remember being at the Gresham Arms in Wood-street—there was some money of mine counted out there on the table bank-notes and gold—that was in case any question should arise about a stranger being in the bank he should pay in a sum to some one in the country so as to be afterwards received—I believe the money passed between Atwell and Saward—I let them have the money out of my pocket and they were counting it—I am not certain whether Atwell had it or whether I had it but it was returned to me—Atwell was at the table at the time and he and Saward I believe were both counting it—shortly after I went down to Yarmouth in the name of James Ralph—I took a small furnished house in that name—before going I made an arrangement that letters directed to James Ralph should be left at the Chapter Coffee-house Paternoster-row—when I came to London I found the Chapter Coffee-house was closed and as I understood it was in Chancery I called on the persons inhabiting the house and asked them if any letters should arrive in the name of James Ralph to take charge of them for me and I would reward them for it which I did—Saward went with me to the Chapter Coffee-house—I introduced him to the young girl who took in the letters and told her if any letters arrived in the name of James Ralph she was to be kind enough to give them to that gentleman which was done Q When you went down to Yarmouth you were aware I believe that letters were to be sent to solicitors there A Atwell was to have the whole management of sending up to London to parties upon I O U s and Anderson was to take lodgings in fictitious names and receive the letters sent from the solicitors—after being some little time at Yarmouth I came up to London to see the result of the letters and to find the money to pay the proceeds to the different attorneys who had been applied to—I met Saward Anderson and Atwell in Queen-street on that afternoon—upon that occasion Saward wrote to the different parties whom Atwell had been in correspondence with about these assumed debts—in pursuance of the arrangement I changed a 500l note and a 100l note to get 600l in gold—the whole of the money remitted to the country was somewhere about 314l —I found the balance very heavy to carry in my pocket and being anxious to return to Yarmouth that evening I paid 250l into Barclay s bank—I paid it in in the name of Whitney but I forgot to put that it was for James Ralph the name that I was assuming at that time I was flurried at the time—when I got to Yarmouth I applied through Messrs Gurney s for the money as James Ralph and then discovered the mistake I had made—inconsequence of that I wrote to Saward under the name of James Ralph at the Chapter Coffee-house—he got that letter and returned an answer which I never got—I was apprehended on the 15th RICHARD MULLENS I am the solicitor for this prosecution I served a notice on the prisoner Saward on Saturday last to produce a letter dated 15th Sept 1856 addressed to James Ralph Esq Chapter Coffee-house—I served that notice on Saward in Newgate Saioard I can produce no letter WILLIAM SALT HARDWICKE re-examined The letter I wrote to Saward was about the error I had made—I said I was afraid there would be a difficulty about it and would he be kind enough to get Mr Bob meaning Anderson to go to the bank as he was with me at the time I paid the money in and try to rectify it—I believe the writing on this envelope to be Sward s unquestionably looking at it —this is a letter addressed to me WILLIAM GEORGE STURT I live at Harfield-villas St Paul s-road Islington I am a commercial traveller I am landlord of the house in which the prisoner Saward lived for about six or seven years—during that time I became acquainted with his handwriting—I believe this letter dated 15th Sept to be his writing—these three letters of 3rd Sept resemble his handwriting very much but I could not be so positive as I am of the previous one—I should believe them to be his—the name of Riley on this note I am not able to speak to I cannot form an opinion as to that it is not so firm as his general handwriting—I should say this the 1 000l bill is like his handwriting Received for Mr Riley John Clemence I believe that to be his—these three letters of 11th Sept bear a similarity to his writing—there is a resemblance but I should not like to say that they are—I should not have acted upon them as coming from him there is a similarity but not so strong as the others I have not looked at them all—the second one is more like I believe that to be his but I should not like to swear to the other two—I believe the direction to be his Saward I have bad several communications with Mr Sturt and he ought to know my handwriting very well so as to speak more positively he hesitated and doubted very much— These letters were here put in and read one from Mr Chamberlain of Yarmouth to Mr Edward Dixon of No 10 Ampten-street Gray s Inn-road applying for payment of 104l 3s 5d due to Mr Henry Attwood one from Messrs Reynolds and Palmer of Great Yarmouth to W H Jones No 13 Union-terrace Bagnigge Wells-road for payment of 105l 14s 6d due to the same person and one from Messrs Miller Son and Bugg of Norwich to the same person for 105l 14s due to Mr Henry Cornwall Three letters dated Sept 3 purporting to be answers to the above were also read and three others dated 11th Sept stating that the money had been paid in to the bankers on that day—The following letter was also read James Ralph Esq No I Trafalgar-place Great Yarmouth Monday I did not write on Saturday because I expected today to have been able to have rectified fully your unfortunate mishap Mr Roberts attended again this morning at B— s to know their determination under the circumstances It is this that Mr Whitney must attend himself at B— s and explain the matter and sign a fresh note with his name the same as he signed the paying in note the writing of course being the same by comparison—they will then send a fresh note as instruction for G— s to pay to James Ralph the paying in note has been sent to G— a and they have it they would not show it to Mr Roberts when he applied there on Saturday but said that Whitney had paid it in to his own credit Now I considered the matter seriatim yesterday and you must do this literally just do as I state go to G— s see the paying in note mind you must see it state you have written to Mr Whitney and he will rectify it at B— s and you will call on them again in a day or two Come up directly go to B— s write a fresh note for them to send to G— s and then return and you will get the cash Pray do not move further in other matters until this is arranged I beg of you not to do so I can see through a brick wall sometimes and I see through one now be guided by me for I am generally secure by caution cavendo tutus as Ovid says Mr Roberts told B— s this morning that he thought Mr Whitney might have gone on a tour of pleasure up the Rhine but he did not know positively they said they could not help it If you can accomplish what you have to do we will meet you to-morrow night Tuesday at 9 at the beef house but if we do not see you there at that time we will meet you the next day Wednesday morning at 12 where we had the chops when you were up on Thursday Now lastly make no move in other matters until this is arranged I have written fully but I hope you will not think it a bore reading Yours faithfully J —As we cannot see the note and they will give no positive information as to it you must see it to know its exact import or the cash may remain longer in jeopardy You must come up directly JOSEPH BOLTON DOE I am an iron founder in Whitechapel I have an account with Messrs Barclay and Co —at Christmas 1855 my premises were broken into—amongst other things I lost three cancelled cheques—counterfoils and all were taken—they were taken out of the book—all the other counterfoils are there—these two cheques which are now filled up are the two that were taken away at that time—they are not in my handwriting—I authorised no one to sign them WILLIAM ISAIAH DUTTSON I am cashier to Messrs Barclay and Co the bankers This cheque for 46l 15s 6d dated 10th Jan 1856 was presented to me for payment—I paid it in two 10l notes and 26l 15s 6d in cash HENRY NICHOLS LESLIE I am cashier to Messrs Barclay and Co This cheque for 95l 17s 6d was presented to me for payment in Jan 1856—I paid it in five 10l notes and 45l 17s 6d in cash MAUDESLEY LANCASTER DRAPER In the beginning of last year I advertised for a situation—I received an answer in consequence of which I went to Leman-street Goodman s-fields to see a Mr Davis—I saw a person there who called himself Davis—it was the prisoner Anderson—he sent me to Moore s auction rooms for a catalogue of to-morrow s sale—I went there—they told me they had no sale on to-morrow—I went back and told Anderson so—he then gave me a cheque to take to Barclay Bevan Tritton and Co in Lombard-street—this cheque for 46s 15s 6d looks like the same—I got the money for it went back to Leman-street and gave it to Anderson—I did not see him after that MARY ANN SMITH I am the wife of Sampson Smith of No 103 Leman-street Whitechapel In Jan last year a person hired a room at my house—he gave the name of Davis—the prisoner Anderson is the person—he only came about an hour for two or three successive days—he did not sleep in the place—he said his luggage had not come—the last day he was there the witness Draper came—he told me that he came in answer to an advertisement—Anderson came to the door and called him in EDWARD BROWN In the beginning of last year I advertised for a situation—I received an answer directing me to go to No 103 Leman-street Whitechapel—I went there and saw Anderson and he engaged me for a situation to go down to Rugby—he told me he would go after my character and meet me next day at the Eastern Counties Railway—he sent me to a house in Bishopsgate-street to get a bill of their wholesale and retail prices of spirits as he said he wanted to take some down to Rugby—I went and got it and gave it to him—he told me I could be gone half an hour that I had no occasion to hurry myself as his friend had not come up by the railway—he afterwards sent me to Barclay s banking house in Lombard-street with a cheque for 95l 17s 6d —the name of Doe was on it—I believe this to be the cheque looking at it —I took it to Barclay s and got the money—I was then walking towards London-bridge—I was going to Mr Burrell s where I had lived as boots to see whether he had been about my character—a young man tapped me on the shoulder and asked me whether I was not going the wrong way—I told him I was not going the wrong way I was going over to Mr Burreirs as he had not said anything about the character—he advised me to go back with him—that was Atwell—I went back with him and met Atwell in Bishopsgate-street—he took me into a public house and there I gave him the money—he gave me 3s —he asked me whether I wanted any money and I said a little would do—he said he had been to Mr Burrell s but he was not at home and he would wjrite next day and let me know when to come down—he never did write ELIZABETH EVANS I am a single woman In the early part of 1856 I was living with Atwell as his wife—I lived with him for about two years and a half—I remember living in Cottagp-lane in the City-road—Atwell went by the name of Hawkes and I was called Mrs Hawkes—I know Saward—I have seen him twice at Cottage-lane—the first time he came was to see Atwell—he was at home and did see him—I did not hear anything pass between them—I should think he stayed about half an hour—they were in a room by themselves—I was in the same room—I cannot exactly say how long it was before he came again I should think about a week or a fortnight—Atwell was not at home then—he came again but then I was not at home—the second time that I saw him Atwell was at home he came into the parlour with Atwell—I was in the parlour when he came in—he spoke to Atwell but I could not hear what it was that he said—he produced some papers like cheques on that occasion he took them out of his pocket and opened them—they were about the size of bankers cheques I could see some engraving at the back of them—these are the cheques looking at the nine produced —they remained in my possession for about four or five weeks until Atwell was taken into custody—I kept them up stairs on the chimney piece in my bedroom—I moved from Cottage-lane and took them with me—I was with Atwell at Yarmouth when he was taken into custody—I did not see Saward afterwards ELIZABETH HAYDON I am the wife of Thomas Haydon a wheelwright of No 20 Suffolk-street St Pancras -road Atwell is my nephew—n the early part of last year he was living in Cottage-lane City-road in the name of Hawkes—I used to go there nearly every day—I have seen Saward there—I first saw him in Feb last year—he was standing against the Sportsman public-house City-road which is nearly opposite Cottage-lane—I was sent to him by Atwell with a message—I did not know him personally only by the description Atwell had given me I went up to him and said I beg your pardon sir I hope you will excuse the liberty I am taking but are you waiting for a gentleman of the name of Hawkes —he said Yes —I said He is engaged this morning and will not be able to meet you but he will meet you at the appointed place on Wednesday —soon afterwards I happened to be at my nephew s when Saward called—I saw him—my nephew was not at home and I told him so—a little after that he called again while I was there I let him in and showed him into the parlour—while he was there with Atwell I happened to go into the room and I saw a small roll about the size of my finger lying on the table—I believe these cheques were the parcel I saw but they were not folded in this manner more like a roll—I saw these papers at my nephew s for several days afterwards on the chimney piece in the front room up stairs my nephew s bed-room—they were then tied with a small portion of string CHARLES FREDERICK ASH I am a timber merchant in Upper Thames-street—I have a banking account with Messrs Smith Payne and Smith s—In the beginning of last year my premises were broken into—amongst other things I lost some cancelled cheques and also some blank cheques taken out of my book—these nine cheques are the cheques I lost—this cheque for 91l is one of those that were taken from the book—I know it by the number—the writing on it is not mine nor is it written by my authority COURT Q I see upon this there is orders not to pay I suppose you took that precaution A Yes I gave notice after discovering the robbery not to pay those numbers JAMES HUMPHREYS In Feb last I was out of a situation I advertised for one and in consequence of a letter which I received I went to Oakley-crescent City-road and inquired for a Mr Hammond—I saw a person there calling himself Hammond—I believe Anderson to be that person—he first sent me to the railway and then to the bank of Smith Payne and Smith s in Lombard-street with a cheque—I believe this cheque for 91l to be the cheque I was sent with—it was not paid—I was detained—I did not see Anderson afterwards until he was in custody ANDREW STEPHENS I am a cashier to Messrs Bramah and Co the engineers—they keep an account with Messrs Ransom and Co —the signatures to these three cheques are not the signatures of the partner who usually draws our cheques—they are a very good imitation of it—the filling up is an imitation of my writing—I always fill up the cheques—these have been returned by the bank included in our account as paid THOMAS COOAN FARTHING I am cashier to Messrs Ransom and Co —these three cheques were paid by our house GEORGE HENRY BOWELLS In March 1856 I was looking for a situation—I received a letter in consequence of which I went to Stanhope-street Regent s-park—I do not remember the number—I there saw the person who was supposed to have written to me—I asked for Mr Bates—I think Anderson is the person I saw—he directed me to go to the Camden Town station to inquire if his luggage had come and when I returned I was sent to Messrs Ransom s Fall Mall East with a cheque for 87l 10s—I believe this to be the cheque looking at it —I took it there got the money and gave it to Anderson at Stanhope-street—there was nobody else there at the time MARY ANN PARKER I live at No 16 Stanhope-street Regent s-park—in March last year a person took a room at my house in the name of Bates—Anderson is the person I am sure of him—he stopped in the house half an hour—he did not sleep there at all—I did not see the young man come there but I know he came I saw him afterwards with the constable—I did not see him speak to Anderson or Anderson to him JOHN WIGZELL In April last I was out of a situation I advertised in the Times—in consequence of receiving an answer I went to a house in Cumberland-street Hackney-road—I there saw a person very much like Anderson he went by the name of White—after talking about employing me he sent me on a message to a street in Fenchurch-street and when I came back he sent me to Messrs Hankeys the bankers with a bill for 386l 17s 10d I presented the bill but it was not paid and I was detained—went back to Cumberland-street but could not find Anderson LOUISA BARNES I and my husband live at No 16 Cumberland-street Hackney-road—in April last a person came to hire apartments—Anderson is very much like that person—he took them in the name of White and came the two following mornings—the next day I saw Wigzell at my house—the man washed his hands each day and called for pen and ink THOMAS GRAY I am in the employment of Dobree and Sons of Token-house yard City—they keep an account at Messrs Hankeys I accept the bills in behalf of the firm—this bill for 386l odd is not my handwriting nor was it written by my authority WILLIAM INKERSOLL —I am in the employ of Kennard and Co —this 1 000l is not the acceptance of Kennard and Co JOHN CLEMENCE I live in Devonshire In June 1856 I was up in town looking for a situation—among other places I went to a hatter s in the neighbourhood of Cheapside and inquired if they knew of any situation of the kind I wanted after I left the shop Hardwicke followed me and put some questions to me—I afterwards received a letter telling me to go to No 3 Beauchamp-villas Kingsland-road—I went there and asked for Mr Riley—Anderson opened the door to me and answered to the name of Riley—he told me to call there the following day I did so and Anderson came to me with a 20l Bank of England note I was to get it changed and to bring two adhesive 10s stamps—I got the note changed and got the stamps and gave them to Anderson he sent me on an errand he afterwards gave me a bill of exchange for 1 000l —I went on an omnibus to the City and took the bill to Hey wood s—it was not paid they gave me part and then stopped the rest and I was detained—I did not see Anderson afterwards till I saw him at the Mansion House—I saw nothing of Saward—I believe the handwriting to this bill to be the same as the note that was written to me—I gave that note to Anderson to show I was the person that had been written to and he kept it WILLIAM PIKE NICHOLLS I am a cashier at Messrs Heywood s I remember this 1 000l bill being presented—I had begun to pay it but had some misgivings and stopped the money and the person who brought the bill—I did not quite like the appearance of the signature the first part I considered a very good imitation but not the second part and the way in which payment was required seemed rather strange 100l in gold eight 50l and five 100l notes ELIZABETH COLE I reside at No 3 Beauchamp-villas Be Beauvoir Town Kingsland—in June last a person took an apartment at my house in the name of Riley—Anderson is the person—I recollect the witness Clemence coming to him there SUSANNAH DAVIS My husband keeps the Sussex Arms in Inglefield-road Kingsland—early one morning in the course of last summer I remember four persons coming to our house it was between 9 and 10 o clock—I can hardly remember whether or not the house was in order at the time they ordered brandy and milk—our house has a small green before it—I cannot swear to any of the persons—I knew them all by sight in the general way of business I think but I cannot swear to their coming to the house that morning—I do not know that I ever saw them together—I know each individually—I think I have seen them at the house at various times—I have seen Anderson and Saward and I have seen Atwell and Hardwicke—I have seen them all four at our house—I cannot say that I have seen them all four together—I cannot say that I have seen two or three of them together ROBERT WILSON I am clerk to Mr Alfred Turner solicitor of Red Lion-square In April 1856 I was employed by a person who gave the name of Hunter to endeavour to recover a debt it was the witness Atwell the name of the debtor to whom I was to apply was Mr John Hesp of No 58 Charrington-street Oakley-square—the money was afterwards paid to Mr Turner and I gave it to Atwell—I got a cheque for it got it cashed and gave it in cash to Atwell—he came again on 19th June and instructed me to write for 103l to a Mr Hart of Milton-street Euston-square—I wrote and on 21st June the money was brought—on the 24th I paid Atwell by a cheque on Gosling s—this is the cheque and this is the receipt he gave me ALFRED TURNER I am a solicitor in Bed lion-square In March last year I lost a pocket book I cannot say in what way—I believe it contained some blank cheques on Gosling s—I remember Atwell applying at my office about the recovery of two debts he saw my clerk Mr Wilson who mentioned it to me—this cheque for 103l was the cheque given on the second application—this cheque for 410l is not my writing or written by my authority I think it is an imitation ELIZABETH SHOEBROOK I live in Charrington-street Oakley-square A person going by the name of Hesp engaged a back parlour at my house last year Anderson is the person—he took the apartment on the Tuesday and said he would send his luggage—it never came he called on the Thursday—two letters had come during that time I gave them to him and never saw him any more ELIZA BREWER I live at No 35 Cardington-street Hampetead-road in June last I lived in Milton-street Euston-square In June last a person hired a parlour at our house in the name of Hart it was Anderson—he said if any letters came would I be kind enough to take care of them a letter came on the Tuesday evening—he fetched it away on Wednesday morning—a second letter came on Friday evening that was given to him on Saturday morning—I saw nothing more of him after that AUGUSTUS BAILEY BUSHNELL I am a cashier at Messrs Goslings the bankers—this cheque for 410l odd was presented on the 28th June—I paid it in eight 50l notes and the rest in gold and silver—I know Hardwicke he was in the bank at the time and put some questions to me at the time the cheque was being presented WILLIAM HARDY In June last I was out of employment I advertised for a situation and in consequence of a letter which I received I went to Albert-road Regent s-park—I inquired for a Mr Taylor and saw the prisoner Anderson—he engaged me and I was to meet him at half past 1 o clock the following day at the University Hotel—I went there and he sent me with a cheque for 410l to Gosling s he told me to ask for eight 50l notes and the rest in gold—I went and did it as I returned I met Anderson by Mornington-crescent and gave him the money I never heard anything more of him JONATHAN GRIERSON I am cashier at Messrs Hankeys the bankers Messrs Smith and Knight keep an account there their cheques are signed by Mr Baldwin their managing man—on Saturday 16th Aug last this cheque for 50l was presented to me for payment it purports to be signed by Mr Baldwin—I paid it in three 10l notes and the rest in gold—on that same day this cheque for 100l was also presented to me for payment—I paid it in six tens and the rest in gold that also purports to be signed by Mr Baldwin—on the next Monday a third cheque was presented for 100l purporting to be signed by Mr Baldwin I did not pay that DANIEL BALDWIN I am in the employment of Messrs Smith and Knight railway contractors it is part of my duty to draw cheques on their behalf—these cheques for 50l and two for 100l are not signed by me or by my authority JOHN MITCHINTON In Aug last I was boots at the White Hart Bishops-gate-street In consequence of something the waiter said to me I went into the coffee room and saw Anderson sitting in one of the boxes—he asked me to go to the bank and change a cheque for him this is the cheque it is for 50l on Messrs Hankey s—I went and got three 10l notes and the rest in gold and brought it back to the White Hart—Anderson was not there then he came in a few minutes afterwards and I gave him the money—I did not see him afterwards till I went to Newgate GEORGE ENGLISH In Aug last I was boots at the Four Swans Tavern in Bishopsgate-street On a Saturday in that month in consequence of something the waiter Raid to me I went into the coffee room and saw the prisoner Anderson—he asked me to change a cheque for him for 100l —this is it—he asked me to get him six 10l notes and 40l in gold—I took it to Messrs Hankey s bank got the money took it back to the coffee room and gave it to Anderson he was not there when I got back ELIZABETH DIXON I live in Chapel-court Union-street Blackfriars-road Hardwicke is my mother s nephew I know Saward as Mr Sharp—I remember his leaving a letter at my house—at that time I had heard of Hardwicke being in custody—he called on me after the letter was left my mother was present at that time—he asked me if I had heard from Mr Hardwicke or seen anything of him—I told him that the officers had been to the square and searched Mr Hardwicke s apartments—Hardwicke lived in Nelson-square at that time—Saward seemed very much surprised—I then said to him that the officers had been there and they expected to find some plate—he said indeed he could not make that out at all—I then said to him Sir as you are a friend of Mr Hardwicke s of course you know his affairs have you no idea what he is detained in Yarmouth fort —he said Well there is nothing of any consequence there but there is no telling what it may lead to —he then asked me where the letters were that he had left for him—I gave them to him—they were directed to Hardwicke one of the letters was the one that Saward had brought himself I gave those letters to him and he burnt them—he said if any inquiries were made at my house whether any letters were left there I was to say Yes there were letters left there for a gentleman of the name of Sharp but a lady called for them MARY WILLIAMS I am the mother of Mrs Dixon I was there when Mr saward came he did not say what his name was I did not recollect him till he made himself known to me I had seen him once some years before—he said to my daughter Have you seen Hardwicke do you know when they are coming home —I believe my daughter said My mother has just come to tell me —I had heard something unpleasant and had gone to my daughter s to tell her but had not had time to do so up to that moment—he asked if there were any letters in the name of Sharp—my daughter said yes she had two—he said Burn them —I looked at him and touched my daughter and said Let the gentleman burn them himself if it is anything wrong and he put them in the fire SAMUEL COLE I am now living at Warwick In Aug last I was barman at the Magpie in Bishopsgate-street Mr Wimbush was the landlord—I remember on a Saturday in that month some persons being there that attracted my attention—there was one person in particular who was there for the greater part of the day it was the prisoner Saward—I did not see any other persons with him but there were two going in and out I know one of those two it was the grey-headed gent I have seen him here today it was Hardwicke—I have seen Anderson before but not to know anything of him—I did not see him at the Magpie that day—Saward came there about 11 o clock and staid till something like 4 or 5 o clock in the afternoon—I did not see the two persons who came in speak to Saward because I was busy taking the orders into the parlour and waiting on the bar—Saward was in the parlour they went into that room there was only that one room to go in—they went to Saward EDWARD JOHN WIMBUSH I am the landlord of the Magpie in Bishops-gate-street On Saturday 16th Aug Cole called my attention to some person being there for some time I walked into the parlour to look round and saw the prisoner Saward—I would not swear it was him I feel confident that it was but he sat in such a bad light that I had not a good view of his face—I believe it was him I have very little doubt about it—I did not see him more than once that day—I did not see any other person there I was out part of the day—I can fix the very day of this in consequence of having paid a doctor s bill that day—it was 16th Aug RICHARD SAUNDERS I was a porter at Gregory s Hotel in the course of last year On Monday 18th Aug a person came there and sent me to a banker s—I believe it was Anderson—he gave me a 100l cheque to take to Hankey s—I took it but it was not paid and I was detained—this is very like the cheque looking at it I think it must be the same WILLIAM HENRY KNIGHT I am a clerk to Messrs Chaplin and Horne I was at the Gresham Arms in Wood-street one morning in the course of last summer—I cannot say the day of the week or the day of the month for I am there nearly every day—I was in the parlour I saw Atwell there and I have every reason to believe Saward there was a third person that was Hardwicke—Atwell and Saward were sitting together at a table—I saw gold passing from the person I suppose to be Saward to Atwell—Hardwicke went out to fetch the directory I do not think he was present when the gold passed I thought they were on business and withdrew before I withdrew I was sitting at the same table with them MARGARET HARDWICKE I am the wife of the witness Hardwicke I live at No 20 Nelson-square Blackfriars-road—my husband was an acquaintance of Saward s for many years—I am not certain whether they were acquainted before my husband went to Australia for the first time I fancy I had seen Saward before but I cannot be positive I always accompanied my husband except once I then remained in Australia—Saward visited us frequently in London the first time I knew him he lived at Kennington Cross we then lived in Goswell-street—Mrs Saward visited us once and I visited them once at Kennington Cross—Saward frequently came to see us in the evening he has been two or three times a week—my husband was not in any way of business at that time he was having remittances from Australia he had no business with Saward that I know of MARY ANN HARRISON I am the wife of Mr Harrison of

frequently at our house—he appeared to be very intimate with Hardwicke MARY BOXALL I live at Mr Turner s at the Crown and Anchor Guildford-street Southwark I am there as a friend I make it my home—in the course of the last summer I used to see the prisoners there—the first time they came they wanted some refreshment and we sent out for some boiled beef—I also recognise Hardwicke and Atwell—I can only call to mind two occasions on which I have seen them there together ELIZABETH WILLIAMS I live at the Chapter coffee house in Paternoster-row It has been left in charge of my brother-in-law Charles Ogborn I knew Hardwicke by the name of Ralph—he came to the Chapter coffee house several times to call for letters—I recollect his coming with a friend Mr Saward he said that he was going away into the country and for the future would I give him the letters and he would forward them on to him letters came directed for Mr Ralph and I delivered them to Saward COURT Q Did you understand his name to be Saward or did he mention any name A They did not mention his name merely as a friend no name was mentioned—I did not know him before CHARLES OGBORN City policeman 26 I am the brother-in-law of the last witness—I had the care of the Chapter coffee house—I remember letters being left there for Mr Ralph—I know Saward—I saw him come to the door of the Chapter coffee house twice I do not know what he called for the first time I was then in the street off duty in private clothes the second time he came for letters my sister-in-law gave him some they were addressed to Mr Ralph CAROLINE HILL I live in Union-terrace Bagnigge-wells-road In Aug or Sept last the prisoner Anderson took a lodging at my house in the name of Jones for a friend that was coming from Brighton—two letters came—he called for them and I gave them to him—I think they were from Yar-mouth—I think this is one of the letters looking at one —it looks very much like it I go by the handwriting ELIZABETH ATTWOOD I live at No 18 Ampton-street Gray s Inn Road A person hired a lodging at my house in Aug or Sept last in the name of Dixon—it was the prisoner Anderson—he said he hired it for a friend he said I was to take in any letters that came in the name of Edward Dixon—a letter came I gave it to my child and she delivered it to him CHARLES HENRY CHAMBERLAIN I am an attorney at Yarmouth On 30th Aug a person calling himself Atwood came to me and instructed me to apply for a debt—it was the prisoner Atwell—in consequence of his instructions I wrote a letter to a Mr Edmund Dixon at No 18 Ampton-street Gray s-inn-road for the payment of 104l—I afterwards received these two letters dated the 3rd and 11th of Sept purporting to come from Mr Dixon CHARLES JOHN PALMER I am a solicitor practising at Great Yarmouth On 30th Aug the prisoner Atwell gave me instructions to apply for payment of a debt for 105l 14s due by William Henry Jones of Union-terrace Bagnigge-wells-road—I wrote a letter and received these two of the 3rd and 11th of Sept in reply—I received through Messrs Gurney and Co bankers at Yarmouth 105l in conformity with the intimation in these letters HENRY BLAKE MILLER I am a solicitor at Norwich I know Atwell by the name of Henry Cornwall—he applied to me on the 1st of Sept to write to a Mr Jones of Union-terrace Bagnigge-wells-road for 105l 14s —I afterwards received two letters from Mr Jones dated 3rd and 11th Sept —I also received an amount of money of which this letter gave me advice JAMES EAGLETON I am a waiter at the Sugar-loaf public house Queen-street Cheapside In Sept last I remember four persons coming there and having some refreshment—they had chops and steaks—Saward was one of the four and Hardwicke was another—they were writing ALFRED WHITTINGTON MORRIS I am clerk to Messrs Barclay and Co bunkers On the 11th of Sept last the sum of 250l was paid into the country department of the bank in the name of Whitney for the purpose of being transmitted to Gurney and Co of Yarmouth—Hardwicke was the person who made that payment—a few days afterwards the prisoner Anderson came to make inquiries about that money and requested me to send it in the name of James Ralph—no name had been given by the person who paid it in—I inquired of Anderson where Mr Whitney was he said he had gone to Germany or up the Rhine JOHN MOSS I am one of the officers of the City police On 26th Dec last I went with Huggett to No 9 John-street Oxford-street for the purpose of apprehending Saward—it is a sort of dining-room—I inquired for Mr Hopkins I was told that Mr Hopkins had just gone out that he had been gone three or four minutes—that was said by a female who came from the back room—she said that he was gone to the second public house on the left hand side in Oxford Market—upon that Huggett went to Oxford Market and I remained at the house—shortly after Huggett had gone I observed the door leading into the room at the back very gently close—I went and looked into the room and saw the prisoner Saward—I said Oh Mr Hopkins we have been looking for you —he said My name is not Hopkins Sir I said No I believe it is Saward he said You are quite mistaken —at this time Huggett returned—we then charged him with being concerned with Hardwicke Atwell and Anderson in forging a bill for l 000l on Heywood Kennard and Co of Lombard-street on the 14th Jan —he said he knew nothing about the forgery or the parties he said he should not go with us unless we forced him he meant merely placing our hands upon him—when we were about to remove him he said Before you remove me I shall be glad if you would allow me to go to the closet I said Yes but before you go there we must see what you have got —Huggett searched him and took from his pocket two blank cheques of the London and Westminster Bank St James s branch—these are them produced —Saward said Oh they are nothing destroy them —after that he did not wish to retire as he had done before—nothing more was said—we put him into a cab and brought him into the City—he said Well I suppose it is no use holding out any longer my name is Jim Saward Saward I denied that strenuously at the Mansion House and I deny it now most emphatically I should not think of making use of the observation I am Jim Saward common sense must tell you so JOSEPH HUGGETT I belong to the City police—I accompanied Moss—I went to Oxford Market leaving him in the house in John-street—on my return I saw Saward and Moss together—I said to the prisoner I believe your name is James Saward and we shall require you to go to the City with us —he said I am not the person you allude to —I said Well we are two officers belonging to the City and we charge you with forging and uttering on the 14th June a bill of exchange for l 000l on Heywood and Co s bank of Lombard-street likewise with being concerned with Hardwicke Anderson and Atwell now in custody —he said I do not know the parties you allude to neither am I the person you take me to be —he was taken into custody and brought into the City—as we came along in the cab after a little conversation he said Well I suppose it is no use my holding out any longer I am Jim Saward —I told him then that I should have to make use of that before the Magistrate as he had all along denied his name to me Saward I deny it I certainly said in the cab You ought to have let me retire for it was requisite I should do so and when I got to the station house I asked him to let me retire he did and I retired Saward s Defence I shall leave the case in the hands of your Lordship as far as I am concerned I am quite unprepared being quite unrepresented Anderson I have nothing to say SAWARD— GUILTY Aged 58 ANDERSON— GUILTY Aged 36 Transported for Life There were other indictments against the

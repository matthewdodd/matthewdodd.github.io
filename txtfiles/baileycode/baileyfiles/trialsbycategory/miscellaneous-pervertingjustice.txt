how this escape came to be found out On Thursday was 7 night in the morning early I took Jeffreys and Hardy out of the gaol in order to carry them to the gaol at Peterborough Upon my servants searching them as we always do before we take them out upon these expeditions they found their irons to be saw d about half off and they brought them to me After I had well secur d them I went on with them and gave strict orders to Freeborn my servant to search after the instruments with which they had been sawing their irons being certain they had some instruments some where there came a letter to me the same day I got to Peterborough which inform d me he had found two brace of pistols but I need not take up the time of the court for he must repeat the farther account himself Wm Freeborn I am one of the turnkeys of Newgate Mr Akerman gave me strict orders when he went with the two prisoners to Peterborough to search their irons I did so and found a bazel upon each leg cut almost in two I took and shewed them to my master who ordered me to go up and search for the saws with which they were saw d I went up into the ward where the prisoners had lain there was Baythorn a person under sentence of death I said to him Baythorn I suppose I shall find your irons cut as the others have been I look d and found his had been touched I said I shall make an example of you if you don t tell where the instruments are that cut them he went to the barrack and jump d upon a box and there were the pistols he was going to take them out I said I could take them out myself Then I saw him open his box and I saw two brace of pistols the brace of horse pistols were loaded the pocket ones were not Q What were they loaded with Freeborn They had twenty-one balls in them both I ask d him how he came by them at first he said he knew nothing of them I found three watch spring saws in frames and some powder in a paper I know no farther how they came there than what Baythorn told me I know the prisoner at the bar used frequently to come to Jeffreys and Hardy Prisoner I came three or four times Q Was he acquainted with Baythorn Freeborn I believe he was because Baythorn had been in that room with them since he was respited We had a suspicion of but two people whom we took which were the prisoner and Hardy the evidence Baythorn told us that the evidence brought the pistols Thomas Hardy On Wednesday the 9th of Jan I had some business on board the Hunter Tender where I saw one Martin who desired me to go to Jeffreys and Hardy then in Newgate and deliver them a message to this effect That he being press d on board the Tender could not do that favour for them but that I could do it as well I went to them in Newgate and in the lodge there they sat and Baythorn along with them drinking red wine together I pull d off my hat and expressed my sorrow at seeing them in that place I deliver d my message Q Did you know them before Hardy I knew Jeffreys and Hardy before I belong to lieutenant Watson and I pressed Jeffreys I did not know Hardy till I saw him at the Privateer s rendezvous I desired to know what business I could do for them Jeffreys put me off from time to time and after that he desired me to go up stairs and drink a glass of wine in the mean time came in Butler the prisoner and another man then we all went up stairs together When we came there Jeffreys ask d me whether I would aid him to make his escape out of Newgate I replied I thought it impossible for him to make his escape and desired him to submit to mercy and make his peace He pointed to a window in the room where we were sitting which I think they call the tap and said Jack Shepherd made his escape out there and why should not I make mine as well as he Q to Freeborn What room is that he speaks of Freeborn It is a room above stairs in the inside the gaol Hardy I still seem d indifferent and he call d to Hardy Said he take your namesake up stairs and make a christian of him When we came up stairs into a place called the master s side Hardy sat himself down on the barrack and said to me has Jeffreys told you the affair I said he has been speaking of it but I don t think there is any probability of it have you seen my jacket said he I said no said he I ll give it you if you will have it I have as many as will serve my life time he went to the side of a deal box and pull d out a key and open d it and took out a handful of swan shot he let one drop to the ground and to excuse it he said have you had any sport you should not bring such things here you are likely to be stop d for it at the same time he open d his box and put his hand upon one of the pistols I saw two there he handled them both Q Was Butler present Hardy No he was then below drinking with Jeffreys he said how do you like my jacket I was very much shock d then for I imagined a man that could father the dropping of the shot upon me could very well shoot me through the head He said will you come for my jacket in the morning I replied yes I ll come betwixt nine and ten but I had no intention to go I understood it was to assist him in his escape This was to get me to the box to see the pistols I wanted to go down stairs to inform somebody in the gaol of what I had seen I went down and saw Baythorn seeing nothing upon him I thought he was not one of the prisoners I said are you one of the gaol He said are you in the scheme Then I walk d towards Jeffreys and said I ll be sure to deliver this message for you he said bring me an answer between nine and ten he took hold of the cuff of my coat and said I should not go yet Q Where was Butler then Hardy He was then with Jeffreys I said to Jeffreys I had particular business an d if I did not go then I could not come in the morning He said sit down We sat there about half an hour during which time Jeffreys Hardy Baythorn the prisoner and Jeffreys s wife seem d to be in discourse together When they thought it was time to go they all got up from their seats We walked to the door and Jeffreys s wife had me by the arm We went out The prisoner went either before or behind me I don t know which I observed one before and the other behind me I thought they had some suspicion of my having an intent to discover the affair Q How many of you came out then Hardy The prisoner Jeffreys s wife another man and I When we were out of the gaol Butler said to me will you be sure to come and bring a brace along with you Whether he said pistols or not I can t say Said I suppose I should be stop d in conveying them in Said he You may easily hide them under your great coat for I carried the pops in I think he made use of those words Q What did you apprehend by the word pops Hardy I apprehend that he meant the pistols which I had seen there Mr Akerman It is a common word for pistols amongst those sort of people Hardy He seeing me indifferent told me it was a deep laid scheme and would certainly do He pointed towards Holbourn and said he d there have a coach to convey them to the waterside or among the sailors where it would be impossible to find them out They seemed to stand under Newgate till they saw me part of my way to the Fleet-Market Q What time did you go away Hardy I apprehend we might go away about six o clock The lamps were all lighted up Q Did you go to them after this Hardy No I never did I was taken up the next day on suspicion with a warrant I gave the same account before Mr Fielding as I do here now and sign d my information before him Prisoner I saw that evidence in the room with Jeffreys and Hardy both

Duke-street On Wednesday the 20th of January in the evening I was going to my employer s in the London-road—I was going up Duke-street and as I came on the opposite side to No 3 I saw Edwards and another man come out of Mrs White s house—Edwards had a bundle—they left the street-door wide open—I saw some others lurking about outside and followed them—they were three suspicious characters as I considered—I saw three standing near the spot besides the two who came out—they were doing nothing but standing close on the spot—Edwards and the other walked down Duke-street and I followed them leaving the three men where they were standing—Mrs White is no acquaintance of mine but I live in the same street—I could see into the house and could see nobody but the men who came out—I knew they did not live there as nobody but Mrs White lives there—about the middle of Duke-street they parted Edwards walked sharply away and turned the corner into Webber-row towards Waterloo-road and at the corner of Waterloo-road I laid hold of his collar and said Come back —he made a stop and I thought he seemed to put himself in an attitude of defence—I put my hand into my pocket and said If you play any tricks with me I will shoot you on the spot —I had nothing to shoot him with—he said nothing but walked quietly back with me to Mrs White s—the bundle turned out to be a clock—he had it with him—I sent for Mrs White who came—I asked if she had lost any thing—she looked about and said Who has been pulling my things about —Isaid Fetch a policeman upon which Langston and several others came to the door—I said to Mrs White Shut the door for there is some of the party —I still held Edwards—the people at the door directly rushed in and Langston struck me on the side of the head—it went right through my hat and cut the lining and all—I could not see what he struck me with but I am positive it was not with his fist—the moment he struck me he said with an oath You b— let go and laid hold of Edwards and lugged us both out together into the street—he laid hold of Edwards and I was drawn out with him—when we got into the street I was thrown down and kicked in the body by some person—I still kept hold of my prisoner and called Murder Police —Edwards was down as well as myself—the policeman No 36 came to my assistance and I gave him in charge—he was taken to the station—another policeman came to my assistance and secured Langston—I left the bundle in the house—I took it from Edwards when I brought him to the house—I saw it was a clock when I took him in Waterloo-road it was not wrapped in any thing—my head bled for about an hour and a half from the blow—the policeman took me to a surgeon to have it dressed—the surgeon is not here—there was a great deal of blood—I have never been able to do any employment since—Ihave kept my bed for above a week—Edwards did not strike me at all—Ihave nothing to say about Hopkins—he was in the crowd at the door—Idid not see him do any thing Langston Q Before you got Edwards into Mrs White s did you see any person standing in the street A I did not bring Edwards up Duke-street but round another way—at the time I brought him back I saw nobody standing by the door—I am positive you are the man who struck me JANE WHITE I live at No 3 Duke-street—I was fetched home on the night in question—when I got there Mr Wood stood there with the clock in his hand and with Edwards in his other hand—it is my clock—I had seen it safe a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before banging on a nail opposite the window—I was at home then and went out to a stand which I have with fruit—I left all right then—I could not swear whether the door was fastened or not—I know I did not leave it quite open but very likely not quite fastened—I think it was ajar—Edwards is a stranger to me and so are all the prisoners—when I got home Wood said Send for a policeman I said Let me have my clock and don t send for a policeman —he said I insist on it you shall not be robbed I will have a policeman —then a person rushed in and struck something over his head—I do not know who it was I was so frightened—I heard the blow struck but did not know what it was with—it could not have been a fist for he was too far off—I rushed out to call a policeman and fell down in the kennel—I got up fell again and Mr Baker of the Oxford Arms hearing the alarm came out and caught one of the young men Langston I ran into the smith s shop and called the landlord of the public-house to assist the man who was down—I had no concern in assaulting him MARY CANTERBURY I was in Duke-street between six and seven o clock in the evening and saw Wood leading a young man by the collar—Ifollowed him to No 3 and then Wood said Go and fetch Mrs White and then bring a policeman —I fetched Mrs White—then Wood sent me for a policeman—I turned to fetch the policeman and met five young men as I came from the door and one said to Wood Bring him out and take him to the station —Wood said No —when they found I was going for a policeman one of them struck me on my breast and said You b— you want a policeman —directly they said that to me Langston who stood on my right side reached over my right shoulder and broke my bonnet and struck Mr Wood a blow over his head—I could not tell what it was with but it must have been with a heavy substance and not his fist—I am positive it was Langston—I never saw the party before—directlyhe struck the blow I got out from them—some of them pulled Wood and the prisoner down—I got out into the street and called for help and Murder —the policeman came—I was frightened and went home—I did not see Langston taken—I saw him at Union Hall the Saturday following in custody—it happened on Wednesday—there was a gas-light opposite at the public-house by which I saw them—I took particular notice of the whole five by the gas-light—Hopkins was one of the five and Edwards was the one who had the clock—I saw Hopkins there but did not see him do any thing JAMES LEWIS I am a policeman I heard the alarm went up and found a number of people collected—there was a cry of Murder —I went into the crowd and found Wood and Edwards on the ground—Wood was lying on his left side and had hold of Edwards with both hands—I took hold of them both—he still called Police and told me to take him in charge for he had stolen a clock—Wood s head was bleeding very much—Idid not examine it afterwards—I did not see whether it was cut—I took Edwards into custody—I picked up a key as I was taking him to the station and a gentleman picked up two and gave them to me—they were picklock keys—I do not know who dropped them—I know it was not Edwards as I was holding him—the three prisoners were taken into custody and taken to the station WM BREWSTER HEMMINGHAM I am a policeman I went up to the crowd and was going to the station with another charge and hearing a cry of Police and Murder I left the charge went to the spot and saw Mr Baker who is not here holding Langston and saying This is him —I seized him stantly—I saw Wood close by him and he said This is him they have stolen a clock and he has struck me —I took Langston in custody—he said Mr Hemmingham do you think I would steal the poor woman s clock —in going along with him he made a very desperate resistance—atthat time Hopkins was close to him trying to get something from him as I perceived or imagined—Hopkins kept close to him I several times told him to keep back—I had another struggle with Langston going along and called Bartlett s assistance and

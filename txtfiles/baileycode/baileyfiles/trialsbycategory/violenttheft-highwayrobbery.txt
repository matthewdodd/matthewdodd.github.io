taking from him a silver watch value 20 l and forty guineas his property May 23 330 Sarah Cane for receiving the said watch knowing it to be stolen May 24 Thomas Piggott On Thursday the 23d of May I supped with some West India merchants at the King s Arms Tavern in Lombard street About eleven o clock we paid the bill and ordered the waiter to get a Coach We waited the return of the porter but no coach could be got Between 11 and 12 it being a fine star-light night I put my sword and cane under my arm and walked When I had just got beyond Somerset house I saw Kelly and St Legar behind me and there was a drunken soldier before me who staggered so that he hindered my passing when I found I could not easily get by I whipped into the street in order to pass by him then Kelly and St Legar followed me when I came to one of the dark passages in the Strand I stopped to let them pass me for I thought they wanted to walk faster than I and when I stopped they stopped I thought it was done out of complaisance When I came to Buckingham street in the Strand I turned down four or five yards thinking it was Villars street where I live but seeing the gate at the end of the street I found my mistake and returned at the end of the street in the Strand that poor man Cave looked me full in the face Kelly seized me with his left hand by the throat and put a pistol or something like it to my temples and thrust it as hard as he could against them and swore by his Maker if I spoke a word he would blow my brains out I said don t use me ill it is not in my power to resist you gentlemen I see what you are about and I cannot hinder you Q Who were then present Piggott They were all three present and Kelly said D - n you you son of a b - h do you speak by G - d if you do I ll murder you upon that I was quite silent and made no reply He still kept hold of me by the collar then he took hold of my watch string he could not easily get the watch out so he tore open my breeches and took the watch out and put it into his pocket Then he put his hand into my right hand pocket and took out all my silver and brass I believe about 10 s He searched with his hand on the side of my breeches till he felt the purse by his hurry I thought he would have torn the purse out I said you may take it he said D - n you you son of a b - h you shall give it me and I gave him the purse with 40 odd guineas I think there were 44 guineas and a half in it As soon as he had got that he put his right hand upon my shoulder and turned my face down towards Buckingham street and he swore by his Maker if I made a noise or offered to follow him he would murder me and bid me go down that street Just as I turned the corner I received a stroke on the left side of my neck with some weapon which I suppose was done with a design to knock me down Q Had St Legar any weapon Piggott While Kelly was robbing me St Legar stood just before me with a drawn sword and held the pint of it close to my breast and Cave stood on the left hand with a drawn hanger over my head I did intend to purse them and I should certainly have overtaken them before they came to the watch but my breeches being unbuttoned hindered me I called to the watch and said I was robbed by three men and the watchman said they were just run by him he asked me if I thought I should know them again I said yes he said go home and change your clothes and follow them but I thought they would certainly be housed before I could do that I acquainted Mr Bowley the watchmaker in Lombard street with the robbery and concluded to advertise my watch with ten guineas reward he advised me not to advertise it as stole but as lost and then I might possibly have it again I advertised it on Saturday the 25th of May Mr Hall seeing the advertisement that morning went to Mr Bowley and told him that such a watch had been offered to him to be pawned to him for three guineas and he refused to take it in Mr Hail s boy found out where the woman lived who pawned it in Scroop s court against St Andrew s church in Holborn Mr Hall s boy went with me to Cave s house for this woman was Cave s wife I told her if she did not let me have the watch I would send for a constable and send her to Bridewell Then she said she had it of one St Legar I found by examining her that Kelly and St Legar lodged at Cave s house I sent for a case of pistols and waited a whole day over against the house but none of them came A woman gave intimation to Cave s wife that Kelly was in trouble about a watch I had information of a place of resort and went with a woman to one Raddy s in Catharine street in the Strand in order to find out Kelly s wife for Hall s boy followed the boy Wood * who came for Kelly s wife But when they found they were watched Wood run away and Kelly s wife was housed at Raddy s As I was talking I discovered Wood and told him I believed he was an accomplice and if he would not make a discovery I would take him up * This Wood was in custody upon this account He said did I rob you what business have you to take me up I sent Kelly s wife to the Counter that night and went to Raddy s again to look after these fellows and Raddy told me if you get your watch again and some part of the money I believe you will be easy I said I should be glad to have my watch again but as to my money I did not expect I told him by what he had said about the watch I knew him to be an ill man and I would take care to get him punished and he said master if I am rightly informed every part of the money is in Kelly s wife s drawers I said I would not go about it at that time o night for fear of being knocked on the head and I said if you don t assist me in taking these fellows and shew some degree of honesty you shall be punished He afterwards informed me that the boy I had taken up Wood had the watch I went to the boy to the Counter and he told me he had lain upon the ground all night and I gave him two shillings for his lodging then he told me the watch was at one Sarah Holland s in Stewart s Rents in Dirty Lane in a cushion in a two armed chair in a paper I went there there was a great mob and with much persuasion and many promises they let me into the room when I got into the room I went directly to the two armed chair and found the watch in a white paper in the inside of the cushion among the hair Patrick Cave was apprehended and desired to speak to me he was going to say something to me I said I do not want you to say any thing for I know all your faces very well and he said he would give me information where the other people were and I believe he did all that was in his power to find them out+ + Kelly and St Legar were taken the 5th of June in the Minories for an assault in knocking down a bricklayer s man for looking at them they were carried to the watch-house without Aldgate and safely conveyed to the Counter by Mr Day the beadle of Portsaken Ward there was a powder horn and a brass ball found in Kelly s pocket Cave I would ask the Gentleman whether I did not offer to come to him if he would not molest me and went to Esquire Piggott and told him all I knew Piggott When I came to Raddy s house Raddy said I am very glad you are here for I have received a message from Cave that he is under a vast concern and cannot eat or drink and that he would be glad to see you if you will promise not to take him that night I told him I would not take him that night he came and we had a great deal of talk I did design to admit that man Cave an evidence but I was told my recognizance would be estreated and I must prosecute Edmund Hall I am a pawnbroker in Gray s-Inn Lane Sarah Cave brought this watch to me and wanted three guineas upon it I asked her whose it was she said it was a gentleman s I told her I did not chuse to lend any money upon it without seeing the gentleman she came again and said what signifies seeing the gentleman but I would not have any thing to do with it I sent my boy to Dawson s at Furnival s-Inn Cellar and there was a man in a livery which I take to be Cave and the woman gave the watch to him William Parrot My master said he would not lend any money upon it without seeing the gentleman and he bid me go with her she was unwilling I should go I went with her to Furnival s-Inn Cellar and the prisoner Patrick Cave came and consabulated with me some time and Mrs Cave gave the watch I believe to Patrick Cave himself and then she said the gentleman does not care you should see him and so you may go back again My master seeing the advertisement said the watch the woman brought is stole I went to Mr Bowley s and told him what had happened and I found Mrs Cave out in Scroop s Court in Holborn I said Mrs Cave you must give a particular account how you came by this watch or you will bring yourself into further trouble and then she said she had it from St Legar Patrick Cave As I was coming home to my own house from my master s at Lambeth after twelve o clock I saw Mr Piggott pass by he was dressed well I had my master s hanger under my arm and I saw Kelly and St Legar in the Strand and I came up with them I was there to be sure Mr Piggott advertised the watch and my wife owned she had it I gave it to her I lived with Mr Ward about four years and had a good character and never was concerned in any such thing before and when I met him I told him I would do him all the service I could and inform him of the haunts of the persons who were concerned with me and so I did St Legar I never was concerned in any robbery with either of them Kelly I have nothing to say but I leave myself to God and your Honours Cave St Legar came into my house took a watch out of his pocket and laid it upon the table I was surprised how he should have a watch because I never saw one with him before the next day I was desired by Mr St Legar to pawn this watch St Legar It is very hard she should say I gave her the watch when Cave gave her the watch Q Did your husband give you the watch or did St Legar give it you Cave St Legar gave me the watch William Kelly Thomas St Legar Patrick Cave guilty Death Sarah Cave guilty as an accessary The Prosecutor

evidence but the Justice told him he should have spoke sooner it was too late or else I believe he would have been admitted an evidence Pris Collins I said to the Prosecutor if you have a mind to be a

all to pieces He swore he would have my watch or my life Q Did Jackson do any thing to you J Nevil He never concerned himself one way or the other only said I should not be abused Q from Conquest Was not the prosecutor very much in liquor J Nevil How came I to know you John I was in liquor but had been asleep and was come to myself but I did not think Conquest would have meddled with me above all men in the world After he had got my watch I went back again to Mr Snocksel s who keeps the inn where we had been drinking and told him what had happened and he and others went and took the prisoners on the road Q from Conquest Did the prisoners ever know any harm of me in his life J Nevil I think this is too true John you used me with very ill manners and I begged for my life as hard as ever any man begged for a bit of bread John Snocksel I keep the Queen s-head at Stanmore the prisoners came into my house I believe between 9 and 10 o clock at night on Sunday was sen night there were 4 of them at first but it being field-day they being all soldiers two of them went away but the two prisoners staid The prosecutor was in my house at the time we had been looking at his watch just before The soldiers used me very ill at that time and I was afraid they would use the prosecutor ill after he was gone as they went out about the same time After some little time the prosecutor called and desired to be admitted into the house again but I was afraid of my life and durst not open the door When I found they had got Nevil away I sent my servant after them who came and informed me Nevil had lost his watch I ordered him to setch the horses that we might follow them I and Smith Terry mounted and pursued them We overtook them just on this side the Welsh-harp and rode on to Kilbourn and called up two people and told them the case they got up and by their assistance the prisoners were secured and taken to a public-house at Hampstead I wanted to know where the watch was and at last Conquest said it does not signify any thing for the watch must come out saying here it is in the corner of my coat where we found it slipt down into the lining the chain was on it but I think the key and seal were broke off but they were found in the same place Then we took them before Justice Errington the watch was delivered to the constable produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor Q from Conquest Was not Nevil so drunk that he was forced to be left at the turnpike and could not go on J Snocksel He was very sober then and could tell what was done to him Smith Terry I was at the Queen s-head at Stanmore on the 16th of June there were four soldiers the prisoners were two of them the other two went away about 11 but the prisoners staid till about 12 the prosecutor went out of the house about that time Q Which went out first he or the prisoners Terry I cannot say which after they were out there was some noise at the door but I did not go out About a quarter of an hour after I went out and saw the two prisoners going by the door towards London then I desired Mr Snocksel to call up two of his men to go and see for the prosecutor fearing they were murdered He called them up then I and they went to see for him Q What are the mens names Terry One s name is William Pinchbeck the other Charles but I do not know his other name Q Which way did you go Terry We went towards London when we came down to the new road end we met him just turning the corner about 2 or 300 yards from the Queen s-head Q Was he drunk or sober Terry I cannot say which for I did not drink with him he seemed to talk very well He told us Conquest had taken his watch from him then Mr Snocksel and I took horses and pursued them We past them at the 6 mile stone We called up two men at Kilbourn to assist us and the prisoners were taken at St John s-wood We took them to the Cock at Hampstead there Conquest delivered the watch up to Mr Snocksel and he gave it to the constable Q Where was the watch Terry It was in the right side lining of his coat We took them to justice Errington s Q to prosecutor When you went out of the house did you go towards London or from London Prosecutor They brought me towards London but if they had let me alone I was to have gone the way from London to my house William Jowel I am drawer at Mr Snocksel s When there was a great noise at the door after the prosecutor and prisoners were gone out my master sent me to the door to listen what was done I heard the prisoner Conquest say to the prosecutor he would have his watch or his life Q Was Nevil drunk or sober then Jowel I believe he was not in liquor Q Which went out of the house first that night the prisoner or Nevil Jowel The prisoners did and Nevil soon after them I heard Conquest say don t hug the watch for he would have it or his life Q How do you know it to be Conquest that said this Jowel I know his voice and they were at the door on the out side Q Did you tell your master what you had heard at the door Jowel I did Q to Snocksel How came you not to interpose here at this time Snocksel I was afraid they had swords and I had been shut up in a room for fear of them some time before they had behaved very bad at my house Michael Timms I live at Kilbourn at the Red-lion On the 16th of June last Mr Snocksel and Smith Terry called me out of my bed betwixt 3 and 4 in the morning and told me there were a couple of foot-pads coming on the road They desired my assistance I and Daniel Wood went We mounted their horses and went round and by St John s-wood that is a little farm called by that name we took the prisoners There we saw George Longland I called him to our assistance I told Conquest we came to take him for a highway robbery committed that night He said he knew what I meant but I was mistaken Q Where was Snocksell and Terry at the time Timms They were coming on foot about 300 yards distance Jackson had this weapon in his hand when I seized Conquest producing a hanger drew it about 3 or 4 inches out of the scabberd I bid him draw it no farther but give it me Then he gave it me saying there it is and resigned quietly It must seem strange to the reader that the two armed prisoners should resign so quietly Note Timms had in his hand a pistol when be demanded Jackson s hanger which he did not mention till the trial was over We bound them and took them to a public-house there Conquest said he was too tight bound and desired somebody would slacken him I said if he would tell where the watch was I would Then he took the lappet of his coat up and said here it is I know it will be found and delivered it Going along the fields Conquest threaten d me saying he d do for me as soon as he got released Jackson We have orders from our officers to carry our hangers with us when we walk out Daniel Wood I live at Kilbourn He confirm d the last evidence s account and produc d a hanger taken from Conquest George Longland I was one of the three that took the prisoners I live at St John s-wood I took Jackson He made but very little resistance We told them it was on suspicion of a highway robbery and tied their hands behind them Q What was that little resistance they made Longland It was Jackson drew his hanger near half out of the scabberd We took them to a public-house but I was out of the house at the time the watch was found Conquest s defence Last Sunday was fortnight about two o clock Jackson and I came off guard I went down to Stanmore to see two children of mine We were going along the road and met with a friend that gave me part of a mug or two of beer We got to Mr Snocksell s about ten o clock at night It was too late to see them then There I saw Mr Nevil he shook hands with me and gave me part of a pint of beer and we drank two

n you your money I ll blow your brains out or something of that kind I saw by the presenting his pistol if there had been a ball it must go through the roof of the chaise he elevated the point pretty high I bid Adams let the glass down the moment that was down I cried fire away upon which Evans fired I could see his face extremely plain by the slash of the pan We fired two pistols immediately upon him from the chaise I thought it would have knocked his head off as the pistols were not three feet from his head there was another man they went away towards London I bid the boy drive on as fast as possible to the first house When we came to Smallberry-green I asked the turnpike man to lend me a lanthorn he did with a bit of candle in it I asked the post-boy if his heart lay right he answered it does lay very right I thought we had killed the person and I was determined not to let him lay in the road but to carry him to Brentford We went to the place and hunted about with the lanthorn and could see no man nor blood I thought then these fellows could not have got far In a little time up came Evans to me this was just as you turn down to the Lord of Northumberland s house I laid hold of him and Marsden seized Swift we tied Evans s hands behind him then I went to assist Marsden and found Swift had got a pistol in the lining of his regimentals we took it out it was a horse pistol He wanted to get away they can jump like greyhounds we tied Swift s hands behind him also and Marsden and Adams took them to the turnpike When we got there I held a candle to the face of Evans and all about his eye were the appearance of gunpowder and there was the least touch in the world of the graze of a ball on his nose Swift desired to have his pistol I said you shall never have it no more his pistol was laid on the table and by the smell of it I am sure it had not been fired off 10 minutes Evans was dressed in his watering jacket and cap and Swift in his regimentals I did not see Swift at the time we fired Mr Marsden will account for him When his wife came to him he said don t make yourself uneasy I bless God there was no ball in my barrel William Marsden On Friday the 31st of January after we had been examining the men on a slight suspicion at the barracks at Kensington five were committed to goal We discovered about fourteen one was upon centry he flung down his piece and ran away we thought proper to give notice to the different officers where the men were quartered we ordered a post chaise with four horses Mr Spinnage offered to go and I offered my service to go with him Adams went with us We were unprepared for any journey the major at the barracks offered us pistols we had two brace given us loaded for our guard first of all they brought us four pistols with but one lock to them all Going along when we got to this place about 40 yards on this side the lane that turns down to Isleworth the first I observed was the chaise stopped I called out what is the matter the boy I think said two gentlemen stopped him I guessed what it was Swift whom I have known for years stood directly opposite the window I sat on the farther side and he on the near side very forward so that I had a full view of him he was in his full regimentals cap and every thing I then had no doubt but that we were stopped I had my pistol ready intending if he had offered any pistol to have shot him it was so ready I knew I could be before hand with him In the mean time I heard him say something to the other man I observed nothing more than the word chaise The other came up and said something of money he came on the same side but the instant he spoke off went the pistol I fired instantly we could but just see which pistol went off first he came in a direction from the horses to the chaise I saw but little more of him than his head and his hand Mr Spinnage fired and so did Adams at the other then they ran away and we went on he that fired into the chaise was in a woollen cap and white jacket We went on to the turnpike and got a lanthorn I took one of the pistols that I found loaded and went on I saw Swift and laid hold of him and knew him directly he was servant to a lady that used to visit Sir John Fielding we took them to the turnpike-house and went to see how many pistols we had we got him to a house at Hounslow and got a constable Evans ran away for that night and was not taken till the Sunday after I saw his face when we brought him to the light all the left part of his cheek and his eyelid was all plain powder to be seen in it When they were examined last Monday se nnight Swift began mentioning the stopping the chaise and Evans acknowledged the same but that it was with intention to ride not to take any thing - Adams I was likewise in the chaise we were stopped a little beyond Brentford I saw a man in regimentals standing in the foot-path a little way from the chaise I kept my eye upon him I did not see the other man till he came to the window there was something said like d - n you your money Major Spinnage said let down the window we let down the side glass and Mr Marsden said keep off the major said fire and I directly fired at the man that stood by the chaise he was dressed in white with his watering cap on I did not distinguish his face then we went on to the turnpike at Smallberry-green we got out of the chaise and came down and met with the two prisoners in the road and secured them We searched them there was a pistol found on Swift When we came to Hounslow on the left side of Evans s face the blood had a little started it looked a little freshish The pistol that was taken from Swift had been fired off the pan was quite wet Mr Marsden held it up and said is this your pistol Swift said it was there was only two pistols fired in the chaise I fired one and I believe Mr Marsden the other - Brooks I was the foremost post-boy going along we perceived two men as we came near them they parted one went upon the causeway and the other in the middle of the road one in white with his watering cap on the other in his red regimentals he in his watering dress came and held a pistol to me there were some words passed between them Then I heard Evans demand the money at the chaise door the glass was down and to the best of my knowledge there were three pistols fired after that Evans came towards my horses they called out of the chaise to go on and we galloped all the way to Smallberry-green turnpike after that they went back and brought the two prisoners to the turnpike Henry Gascoyne We were going along just on the other side Brentford by the lane that goes up to Sion-house all on a sudden we stopped I asked the boy what was the matter he said Harry here is a man has hold of my horses and will not let me go They let down the glass of the chaise and asked what was the matter I said here is a man stops us the man in regimentals stood on the bank side He said You scoundrel why don t you go and demand their money he let go the horses heads and ran by me and said your money gentlemen Who fired the pistols I cannot say but I could hear the report of two they were so close I could hardly distinguish them after that there was another pistol discharged which was I believe to the man on the bank then they ordered us to go along as hard as we could to the turnpike The prisoners in their defence denied the fact and said they had been out and staid till locked out of their quarters that they imagined the chaise to be a return post chaise and they went up to it in order to get a ride Evans called Mary Barber Daniel Jopson Richard Sealtock William Gough and John Purcer who gave him a good character Swift called Stephen Kendrick and William Kendrick who gave him the same Both Guilty T

t17741019-3  680 681 M JAMES KNIGHT and GEORGE TOMLIN were indicted for feloniously making an assault with an offensive weapon called a pistol upon Jonathan Snow in the king s highway with intent the money of the said Jonathan to steal against the statute Aug 26th * Jonathan Snow I live in Marsham-street Westminster On the 26th of August coming from Ham between eleven and twelve o clock at night in a coach in company with Mr Jackson a clergyman and two other gentlemen all four in the coach in the broad part of Turnham Green we had heard before we came there of a robbery that night in Gunnersbury lane having arms we determined not to be robbed at the broad part of Turnham Green Mr Jackson observed a couple of fellows there he asked Mr Churchill what he thought of those fellows he replied that they looked very suspicious while we were talking in that manner one of the men rushed out from behind some trees upon which Mr Jackson repeatedly told him he would fire at him if he did not keep off I looked out on the other side and saw another man running after the coach upon which I told him if he did not desist I would shoot at him still he kept running on till he came within about fifteen yards of the coach I believe that man that ran after the coach was James Knight but I cannot be positive as to his person but am positive to his size and can swear to the clothes he was in at Sir John Fielding s I fired at him and this man whom I took to be Knight put himself in a posture of firing but I saw no weapon that he had at that time Mr William Jackson I was in the coach on Friday evening the 26th of August last with the other gentlemen this happened between eleven and twelve o clock at night at Turnham Green between two houses that have each the sign of the Pack Horse I sat back on the right hand Mr Churchill on my left hand there is in that place a row of trees railed from the common road that are before some houses just at the corner of the rail to the best of my belief stood James Knight but I cannot positively say it was him he is of the same size and had the same clothes when I saw him at Sir John Fielding s that the man had at that time but I cannot be positive to the person of the man I asked Mr Churchill what he thought of that fellow seeing him there he replied he thought he looked very suspicious and then this man ran a-cross the road to the other side of the coach he said nothing at that time nor did I see any weapon that he had when we came about twenty yards further another man rushed out who I believe to be Tomlin he kept on our side of the coach upon which I leaned out of the door presented my pistol at him and threatened to fire if he did not keep off still he continued to pursue us apparently with a design to reach the coach door but before he could get so far as that he put his hand to his breast and took out a pistol which he presented and fired I am pretty sure that Tomlin is the man I can speak much more positively to him than to Knight It was a moon light night I leaned out of the coach with the pistol in my hand and kept looking at him therefore I am more positive to his person than I can be to Knight Upon his fireing I opened the coach door and jumped out and Mr Churchill followed me and pursued the fellows but they went off by a bye path which I since find goes to Acton Common and escaped These two prisoners were afterwards brought to Sir John Fielding s among other men brought there under different accusations they were in the same clothes or clothes exceedingly like the clothes they had when this attempt was made upon us I charged them both being very sure of Tomlin but not quite so sure of Knight when I saw them at Turnham Green the two men did not appear to be connected together or be in company with each other possibly they might be but I cannot say they were and neither of them spoke a word Knight s Defence I lay at Dartford on Saturday and Sunday night with an acquaintance on the next night he and I came five miles to an old fellow servant s on the road there we lay on Tuesday night on Wednesday night I lay at Kent-street we both lay at the Bull at Kent-street end on the Tuesday and Wednesday night I went to the White Bear in Piccadilly there I had my things directed to the Ship at Turnham Green in order to go down to see my friends going along Piccadilly I met a young woman and a young fellow she picked me up I went with her to Kensington there two young fellows came after me one struck me in the mean time Tomlin came up to me I said I could not stand as there were two men against me I asked Tomlin to hold my clothes I charged the watch with them when the watch came to Tomlin I found Tomlin had a pistol in his pocket I said to the men I had business in the country I would depart and make it up Tomlin said he had a pistol in his pocket he would stop a coach between the Adam and Eve at the turnpike came a coach which he was going to rob but I

assisting me Tomlin then said I was confederate with him the landlord asked him if he knew me he said he knew nothing of me Tomlin s Defence The first acquaintance I had with this man was at the Adam

t17741019-50  735 736 737 738 M JOHN RANN WILLIAM COLLIER ELEANOR ROACHE and CHRISTIAN STEWART were indicted the two first for that they in the king s highway in and upon the Reverend William Bell doctor in divinity did make an assault putting him in corporal fear and danger of his life and stealing from his person a watch with the inside case made of silver and the outside case of tortoiseshell value 3 l a stone seal set in gold value 5 s a gilt key value 6 d and eighteen pence in money numbered the property of the said William Sept 26th And the other two for receiving the above goods well knowing them to have been stolen * Dr William Bell In my way home to Gunnersbury on the 26th of September at rather more than a quarter past three o clock I came through a part of the town of Ealing that part that is next Brentford when I was a little way in the town my attention was attracted by two men on horse-back who were before me they rode one immediately behind the other they walked their horses Something appearing singular about the head of the first man I took my glass out of my pocket to see what it was I found it was the flap of his hat let down all round probably without strings and a red handkerchief upon it they walked their horses I trotted and by that means came up to them before they had quitted the houses at the end of the town and their dress and appearance being something singular attracted my notice to see what they were the thought of their being highwaymen never entered my head but that my pace might not be hindered by them I passed them close by the hedge and then I put my horse into the track immediately before the foremost man as I passed them I took particular notice though as I said before I had no thoughts of a highwayman that the hindermost man was clothed in a lightish coat a hat flapped round a great deal of black hair hanging loosely about his head and his horse was something of a kind of brown though I took no particular notice The first man I observed to be in a frock mourning coat buttoned I likewise observed as I passed by him that his horse was black and very low in flesh it struck me that his boot was shorter than boots commonly are and there appeared over it something of a light coloured stocking I took notice likewise that his boots were very dirty and his hair was loose about his head but not in so large a quantity as the man I first came up to the man that I first came up to I observed to be of a very sallow countenance and of a sickly look + the other was not sallow or sickly they each kept their heads steadily forwards but both looked at me my way lay perhaps about a quarter of a mile straight forwards I went that quarter of a mile and then turned as my way led me off to the left in the road that leads to Gunnersbury I soon heard the sound of I thought two horses in the road and thought I heard the sound of wheels and from a curiosity I cannot account for I turned about to see what carriage might be coming behind I looked and could see neither horses nor carriages nor at that time could hear any thing therefore I concluded they were at that time down in that part of the road which forms a hollow and which going low it was impossible for me to see I turned forward again and rode off in a little time on a sudden I heard two horses coming up briskly after me I heard there were no carriages I had nothing to get out of the way of and having no apprehension I did not turn my head to get out of the way but when I found by the sound of the horses feet that they were just coming a-breast of me turning my head to the left to see who might be passing me upon that instant a black horse s head and neck came up directly to my bridle and turning to see who might ride upon me in that manner having then no thoughts of a highwayman when I immediately perceived the man I passed first at Ealing Town he at that instant said either so sir or stop sir as soon as he had said this and partly by his riding upon me and my checking my horse I was stopped he immediately said your money I said my money he immediately answered yes or I will blow your brains out he upon that instant put his hand into the sore part of his coat as if he would open his coat in order to take out a pistol but did not open his coat nor take out any pistol upon his saying that I believe I answered I will give it you I drew my glove off my right hand knowing my silver was always in my right hand pocket and I had no purse in the other taking up the flap of my coat he saw the key of my watch and said and your watch too sir in a minute and take no notice as I was at that time looking him in the face I put my hand into my pocket I had only eighteen pence there I held it to him in the palm of my hand he took it up I held my watch in my hand he took it greedily and bid me ride on I did and they galloped off instantly My lord I omitted one circumstance that all the business was transacted with the man who set himself before me but I was sensible that in half a minute after he was up with me there came another horse close on my right hand but kept behind me and staid there during the time I was robbed and then they rode off together + Note Collier answered that description Q Do you believe the prisoners to be the men Bell I was robbed on Monday I was called to see these prisoners in Bow-street on Wednesday having been robbed in open day light and they having no disguise upon their faces I was in hopes before I saw them that the first sight of them would sufficiently convince me whether they were the men or not therefore when I was at the upper end of the Court and they came into the lower part I kept my eyes off them that I might not see them till I was ordered to go into the Court to look at them at the very first view of them I could not have sworn to them there was so much difference though at the same time so much likeness that I could not positively swear to them I took a considerable time to look at them after having done that I went into the yard to relieve them and myself and came back to look at them again and I do declare upon my oath though at first sight I could not undertake to swear to them yet I did in the progress of my survey see such looks and marks that I do declare that I firmly believe that John Rann is the identical man that robbed me and I do believe that if I had had the same conviction upon the very first sight of them as I had after I had attentively surveyed them that I should at first sight have positively swore to them and I do also believe that William Collier is the other man that I saw pass riding with John Rann My attention was wholly taken up with the man that actually robbed me and I neither saw the other man nor horse though I am confident there was a horse there close up to me Q Which of the men did you see at the time of the robbery Bell John Rann Q You saw him after that at Sir John Fielding s Bell Yes Q Was your opinion confirmed or staggered by that Bell Confirmed Q Upon the result of the survey and deliberation are you of opinion or not of opinion John Rann is the man that robbed you Bell Clearly of opinion Q Is your opinion equally clear with regard to Collier being with that other man at the end of Ealing Town or less clear Bell I would hardly from the nature of things say it can be so equally clear but the remarkableness of the person of William Collier is so very great that I think myself very clear John Cordy I am a pawnbroker in Berwick-street On the 26th of September the day Mr Bell was robbed the two women prisoners Roache and Stewart came to my house and offered a watch to pawn I was not in the shop my lad came for me I went I asked them if it was their watch they said a gentleman left it with them this was between eight and nine o clock I asked them who the man was and said the man must come or I cannot lend you money upon it why said Roache it is a very singular circumstance that you should object to this you took a watch of me at such a time I said I knew I did but that was no rule she should be entitled to bring more she said it was a very singular circumstance and why should I stop it I said I must till the man comes I knew well where they both lived so I made as light of it as I could and said they must bring the man the short one Stewart said well it is a matter of indifference we can bring the man to-morrow I said if so it will do I let them go I went directly up to Sir John Fielding s I got two of his men we went down to their house and took the two women I left my two servants with one of the constables to wait for the two men and on ransacking the house the constable and I found two pair of boots quite wet and dirty I took the watch to the watchmaker he told me it was Mr Bell s I found the women at their lodgings I was at Sir John Fielding s when the two men prisoners were brought there by the constable this is the watch producing it Dr Bell The watch seal and chain are mine William Hill I am a postilion to her Royal Highness the Princess Amelia I saw Rann go through Acton the same day the 26th of September it was about ten minutes after three Q How far is Acton from Ealing Hill About a mile there was another young man with Rann at that time Q Was that the other prisoner Hill I cannot tell I did not take much notice of him I am sure as to Rann Q Did you know Rann before Hill Yes they were going towards Ealing Q What coloured clothes had they on Hill I did not take particular notice of their clothes I know Rann by sight very well Q Did you take notice whether they were clean or dirty Hill Dirty their boots were very dirty one of their boots was rather shorter than the other Blanchville Clarke I am a constable belonging to Sir John Fielding upon Mr Cordy the pawnbroker coming to the office Mr Halliburton and I went up to Miss Roache s lodgings Mr Cordy shewed us the lodgings on searching in her apartments in the left hand closet I found two pair of boots quite wet and dirty as if they had been wore that day Q What time in the evening was this Clarke It was after ten o clock I cannot be particular to the time I took Miss Roache and Christian Stewart and brought them down to Bow street I went back and took Peter Senhouse with me I was then informed that the two prisoners had come in and Halliburton had taken them into custody when I went back to Bow-street I found them there William Halliburton I went to Roache s lodgings with Mr Cordy and Mr Clarke when we came there we found these two girls and these boots Mr Cordy and Mr Clarke and the two women went away together to Bow-street I with Mr Cordy s two young men staid behind about a quarter after ten o clock or it might be more I heard a knock at the door I went and opened it the first person that came in was Rann who I knew perfectly before I desired him to walk in and was going to shut the door I found a person against the door I let it open again and then came in Collier I got them into the parlour and made them fast and carried them to Bow street I believe they did not speak a word till I tied their hands then Rann spoke out what have I done now and got in his old way of swearing Hannah Craggs I live in Berners-street Roache and Stewart lodged in the same house On the morning of the day they were taken in the evening I let in Collier between ten and eleven o clock he came to Miss Roache between eleven and twelve two horses came up to the door I saw Rann I did not know his name then go into the necessary house in the morning I imagine he was there all night but he was not to my knowledge there were two horses walked about the door some time soon after somebody opened the parlour door and paid for the horses Q What colour were the horses Craggs They were so low in flesh I could hardly tell one seemed of a blackish colour the other rather brown somebody opened the door and paid them for the horses then I heard the door open and Rann and another man went away after the horses it must be the two prisoners I do not suppose there were any others in the house I saw the same men again in the evening when Sir John Fielding s men took them I did not see them before nor did I know who they were till then I am sure to Collier Rann was dressed in reddish coloured clothes Q from Rann Why you say I was in the house in the morning Craggs I saw him go into the yard there was a woman with him she said who he was I had heard great talk of him but did not know who he was Rann s Defence I knows no more of it than a child does unborn nor I never seed Mr Bell before he came to Sir John s which Mr Bell must be certain of for to think for me for to come to him in the middle of the day for to rob him which I was never guilty of I know no more of the affair what these gentlemen that belongs to Sir John that wants to do things to swear my life away for I don t know what They have said false things to you I know no more of it if I was to suffer death to-morrow This woman wants to swear my life away for an affair I know nothing of no more than this candle and I am innocent of the fact if I was to suffer for it to-morrow if I had been guilty I would not have trusted her with the affair Collier s Defence On the 26th of September last I called at Miss Roache s lodgings when I came in I asked if she was within there was a stranger who was Halliburton he opened the door he said no and desired I would walk in I walked in he took hold of my hand and the other prisoner s and bound us together and said you must go with us and took us to Sir John Fielding s Roache s Defence These are not the men that gave me the watch there were two gentlemen went by my parlour window that afternoon they were dirty and wet they said they were just come to town they asked me if they might come in I said they might they sat a little while and asked me to give them leave to change themselves they had just come to town they had clean shoes and shirts &c the maid helped off the boots one of the gentlemen was dressed in mourning he asked me to go into the bed room with him I did he said he had no money he had nothing but notes about him and his watch and he would leave his watch and if I wanted money I might pawn it and he would dine with me next day and give me ten or twenty pounds if I wanted it I went to the pawnbroker that I have dealt with two years to pawn the watch he stopped me indeed he did not stop me because he knew where I lived and I believe does not know of my pawning any thing but my own property I said a gentleman was to come for it I came home to my lodgings I was going to bed when the pawnbroker and Sir John Fielding s men came in in the morning a gentleman of my acquaintance called upon me and said he was going out of town for three weeks a little after he was gone away two horses came to the door the maid was gone out for some beer I said the horses were come to the gentleman in the parlour the men went and ordered the horses from the door I know no further of them my life has been threatened a great while about Mr Du Wall s watch that they would not mind what they did to bring me into a snare some of his acquaintance might lay the snare to bring me into it he is not the man if I had known the watch was stolen I should not have offered it to a pawnbroker I had dealt with a great while Stewart s Defence I was servant to this lady I went with her to the pawnbroker I told this lady I was surprized to have the horses coming at this time of day she said she was surprized at it and wondered who they came to I said they came to some young man that used to call upon my mistress who I supposed had ordered them to come here instead of elsewhere I went and ordered them from the door when the horses came up two gentlemen came past the window and asked how she did she said very well they asked if they might come in I said yes I opened the door one was dressed in second mourning he came in and saluted my mistress the other sat down in the parlour I went down into the kitchen I did not come till I was called again my mistress went into the back-chamber with this gentleman she came out again she had the watch in her hand the gentleman said you may pawn the watch for four or five guineas or whatever you may get for it I will come tomorrow and dine with you and get the watch RANN and COLLIER Guilty Death ROACH Guilty Transportation for 14 years STEWART Acquitted Collier was recommended by the Jury to his Majesty

I am sure of it he passed me afterwards he cut at me several times and I saw his face perfectly clear I am very sure he is the man that cut at me he was one that staid behind and I being the hindermost man of our company I looked at him and saw him and saw him very plain I looked at him while I was engaging him it is natural for a person when engaged in single stick to look at the man full to look steady in his face to see his eyes Have you any knowledge in single stick - A little I have Was it-light enough to see his face - Yes I have no doubt about his face Have you nothing to say about the others - No nothing Mr MYLES sworn There were three men you met - Yes One of them laid hold of Mr Bull I understand and you attacked him -

I believe him to be the stoutest man there Lee Had he any weapon - He had a cutlass Cross-Examination What is your reason for believing him to him to be the man - I have not the least knowledge of his face I cannot say to his face I think by his size he appeared to have a brown coat on buttoned up I saw him on the Friday following at the Rotation-office I think he wore the same dress with the man that attacked me I do not know his voice Does that shake your opinion as to his being the man - No it does not I still believe him to be the man I thought he made use of another voice when he stopped me first and a different one before the justice What are you - I am a shagreen case maker springer and liner in the watch branch we were five of us going to the Red-Lion Islington we meant to make a party to oblige a friend and we met at the Blue Anchor Bunhill-row I never knew either of these men before To Mr Burrell At what distance could you discern the face of the man that attacked you - I was as close to him as any man that was engaging Was it not rather dark - Rather dark not very dark there were some stars out Harris wore a flapped hat not a round hat Do you know that it is usual for sailors to carry cutlasses -

I am afraid it is but indifferent Court to Jury Gentlemen of the Jury This is an indictment for a robbery on the highway it is unnecessary for me particularly to state the evidence to you if you believe the two witnesses that have been adduced to prove this case this man was stopped he was shoved by the prisoner at the bar the money was knocked out of his hands and two shillings were taken away from him that does not rest merely on the evidence of the prosecutor but is confirmed by Richard Freer and the prisoner in his defence goes so far as to say that he gave him a shove It is also in evidence that the other man run away with the money The sum Gentlemen to be sure is trifling but then the man is poor from whom that sum is taken and he is to be protected in his property as well as people in a superior station If you think that these two men were in one common design to do this poor man an injury and to take away his property the act of the one in the construction of law is the act of the other and it is not extremely material which gave the man the shove or which took up the money Gentlemen at the same time that it may be right to discountenance a proceeding of this kind especially in a man who from his own witnesses cannot give any very good account of himself and who appears to be a man of a very indifferent character yet considering the sum taken the manner of taking it and that there was no very great violence offered to the man perhaps it may let in a discretion which in point of humanity the law has permitted you to exercise that is to acquit the prisoner of the robbery and find him guilty of the larceny or it is in your discretion to acquit him generally as you think the nature of the case in point of example requires Prisoner My Lord I had no more intent to hurt the man any more than I had to hurt you I am only my own enemy and nobody else s they speak against me from the market because I will not work for them at under price and I will not do it GUILTY Of stealing but not of putting the person in fear Court to Prisoner I understand you have had a great quantity of correction which has had no effect and that you are one of them who had better be removed from the country the sentence therefore of the Court is that you be transported to America for the term of seven years Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr DEPUTY RECORDER

No the prisoner was on the pavement and I turned round and cried stop thief two people came up and he was secured he let the money drop and another man picked it up Court How do you know he let the money drop - I heard it fall I saw him drop it Who picked it up - One of the men that is here Was you sober - Yes Prisoner I was eight or nine yards out of the crowd Prosecutor No such thing you pressed me yourself JOHN SMITH sworn I saw the prisoner as I was going to the Royal Exchange on some business of my master s coming back there was a parcel of people stood Mr Pitt was going to dine in Grocer s-alley and in the space of five or six minutes I heard a man cry out stop thief I am robbed I am robbed I turned round and saw the prisoner stepping under the wheel of a coach with a yellow bag in his hand I took hold of him and he flung it down directly Who had hold of it at the time - I cannot tell he was going under the wheel of a coach I saw a man in a white frock gather it up I secured the prisoner WILLIAM EAMES sworn I was near Grocer s-alley I saw the man drop it What man - James Nowland the prisoner Did you know him before - No he was in the street off the pavement between Grocer s-alley and the Old Jewry there was a pole of a coach just before Did you observe his posture at the time - He came stooping and clapped his hand to his knee when he dropped it I picked it up What did you do with it - I gave it to Mr Booth Court to Prosecutor When the purse was put into your hands did you open it to see what was in it - No What was done with it - It was given to the constable THOMAS TENNER sworn I have the purse it is in the same state I had it I gave the money to the prosecutor by order of the Lord Mayor Prosecutor I received the same sum back that I lost The purse deposed to PRISONER s DEFENCE My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury I was coming through the city the day that Mr Pitt was coming to dine at Grocer s-hall we were about two thousand in company standing and walking there was a great crowd of people I saw the prosecutor running with his bundle over his head says he I have lost my money a man came and laid hold of me I suppose they judged because I was meanly dressed I took it I am as innocent of it as any gentleman here in Court What are you - A shoe-maker I have been but a fortnight in England I came from Ireland You are not an Irishman - Yes What part of Ireland - Broadie in the county of Meath I have nobody to speak for me without it is your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Grand Jury Court You should have stood your own friend when you had it in your power Court to Jury Gentlemen the only doubt that arises in my mind upon the case is this he is charged with having assaulted this man and with having taken this purse by force and violence from his person now whether it was a fact of that nature or whether it was what I dare say the prisoner meant it should be a picking of pockets only I think that is the material question on this case for there seems to be no doubt but he had a great share in the mischief whatever it was now if he laid hold of the man s bundle behind and so pressed him backwards by force and so took the purse out of his pocket I think the indictment is proved and it will constitute a robbery because it is a forcible taking from the person on the other hand if when the prisoner was in the crowd the prosecutor was thrown back and his pocket was picked that would be stealing but it would not be robbery because to make it a robbery there must be some degree of force used on the person of the man from whom the property was taken the prosecutor says that force was used by the prisoner and by some person who threw him back if he did that is as I told you robbing him if it was the other way that would not be a robbery but stealing therefore you will take that single point into your consideration if you agree with the prosecutor and think he was sufficiently attentive to what passed to be able to know with certainty that the prisoner was the man that actually threw him back by his bundle then you will find him Guilty of this indictment as here charged if you think from the situation he describes himself to be in and the crowd that was there that part is not sufficiently made out to your satisfaction you may acquit him of the robbery and find him Guilty of stealing only Jury Did not the crowd press you - He pressed me himself he stood at my shoulder as this man may do now Jury Was you on the pavement or the highway - On the pavement Court How near was the coach wheel to the pavement - As close as it could get once Jury Are you actually clear that the prisoner drew the weight over you purposely or was he pressed upon you - There was no other man standing behind him he was as near the house as he could get Jury to Eames Did not you say it was between Grocer s-alley and the Old Jewry - Yes GUILTY Of stealing but not violently from the person Transported for seven years Tried by the second London Jury before Mr Baron EYRE

t17851019-34  943 JAMES ROOK and JAMES JORDAN were indicted for that they on the 22d of September last feloniously did assault one James Stewart on the King s highway and did then and there demand his monies with a felonious intent his monies from his person and against his will feloniously to steal take and carry away JAMES STEWART sworn On the 22d of last September I was coming home through Wellclose-square about half past ten or rather better it was on a Thursday night the two prisoners came up to me one laid hold of one side and the other of the other side they said it did not signify money they wanted and money they must have They took hold of me by the lappels they said no more to me I thought of laying hold of them and calling out watch but upon a second reflection I threw my arms against one and extended them and drove the other against the wall and called out watch with that one of them recovered himself and gave me a stroke under the eye which gave me a black eye they ran and I after them and by Nephine-street one of them turned down and two or three watchmen were gathered together and they took Rook and I went after Jordan Are you sure the other man is the same person - I think he is the same Can you undertake to swear positively that he is - I certainly can now or I would not have sworn at first he was not out of my sight five minutes before he was brought to the watch-house it was a moonlight night Are you quite sure of Rook s person - I think it is the same person Thinking alone is not sufficient can you undertake to say with certainty it is the same person - I positively can JOSHUA GRAHAM sworn I belong to the liberty of the Tower of London on the night of the 22d I sat up to look after the watchmen I sat the watch at ten and I went out at the half hour with the watchmen not the way that he went but another way and I was up at the further end of Grace s alley talking with another officer and I went into a house about five minutes and then the man was gone from the box I went to the watch-house and went in and they said they had got a man a thief I enquired who gave charge the prosecutor said he did the prisoner Jordan was then in the watch-house and he said he charged him with intent to rob him and assault him I took him and searched him and found nothing upon him but a shut knife a pocket knife and I think I recollect nothing but two sixpences or two shillings I know one of them had two shillings and the other had two sixpences and some halfpence before I had done searching him Rook was brought in the gentleman said directly that was the other he could positively swear to him nothing was found upon him only a common knife and some silver GEORGE TYLER sworn On the 22d of last month about half after ten or better I heard a great noise crying out watch I went and looked down Grace s-alley and I saw the prisoner Jordan crying stop thief and the prosecutor was after him and he came up and said he was the man and positively he could swear to him What did he say the prisoner did - That he offered to rob him LLEWELLIN JONES sworn I heard a noise and I ran after the prisoner Rook he cried stop thief and in Virginia-street a man came out one of the watchmen hit him over the leg and I came up and took him he said do not use me ill for I have hurt nobody I said what did you run for he said there were a good many run as well as me I took him to Wellclose-square and put him in the watch-house there was the prosecutor who said directly that is one of the men that stopped me Mr Garrow Prisoner s Counsel My Lord I beg leave to trouble the Court with a few observations on the indictment I have forbore to ask a single question of any of the witnesses because it seems to me to be the shortest way to take your Lordship s opinion at this stage of the business this offence or rather the offence intending to be described in the indictment arises on an act of parliament made in the 17th and 18th years of the late King and from the preamble of that act coupled with the enacting clause of it it seems to me to be clearly decisive that this indictment cannot be sustained it recites that many of the King s subjects have been put in great fear and danger and that the punishment of such offenders that is of offenders who assaulted the King s subjects with intent to rob and put them in fear and danger of their lives was not sufficient My Lord I am perfectly conscious that I am addressing myself to a Court that know perfectly well what is meant by assaulting and putting in fear and that it constitutes a highway robbery now this preamble says this is with intention to rob those acts of parliament therefore were not intended to protect persons from bare larcenies from the person but were intended to meet a new species of offence where persons with arms or by violent menaces or by force which might on persons of a firm and found mind produce such terror as to cause them to part with their property did assault the King s subjects with intent to rob and the legislature thought that this was an offence fit to be punished in some severer sort therefore they inflicted the sentence of transportation then the entering clause goes on to say that this penalty should apply to persons who should either with offensive weapons or by menaces demand any money or goods with felonious intent to rob or commit robbery upon such person or persons to whom such menaces should be applied My Lord my objection is first that there is no menace of the sort described by this act of parliament in this indictment Court You have dropped one part of the act of parliament which adds or shall by any forcible or violent manner demand these are the words upon which the present indictment is framed Mr Garrow Then my Lord in the first place I take the liberty of saving upon this evidence it is entirely impossible for the Jury to find that there has been an assault in a forcible or violent manner the evidence of the prosecutor was this that he was either met or overtaken or found himself in the way of the prisoners and one of them made use of this expression money we want money we must have Now I need not state to the Jury that that expression is perfectly equivocal it is the language of threat of menace or the language of supplication of indigence in the mouth of a beggar there is no sort of pretence that this was accompanied by any force or by any indication on the part of the person asking that he intended to distinguish his application from that of a beggar a man earnest for a bit of bread might address the person of whom he fought relief by laying his hand on any part of the body and most naturally on the shoulder of such person But still my Lord I have a clear and palpable objection because the indictment states this and this only because it states that it was with a felonious intent his monies from his person and against his will feloniously to steal take and carry away that is the description of a simple larceny I take the liberty of observing that it was not to protect persons from simple larceny but from that higher offence and in order to the constitution of which there must be a threat applied to the person from whom the money is demanded this indictment does not state in the words of the act of parliament that this was with intent to rob or to commit robbery and it seems not to have been enough for the legislature to have contented itself with one expression but left any man of less sense than all those who constitute this Court are blessed with should mistake the legislature seems to have been anxious to have pinned down the sense and to have marked its meaning so that no man could possibly mistake it for it goes on to say with intent to rob or with intent to commit robbery marking it as contra-distinguished from an attempt to commit simple larceny My Lord I contend on the part of the prisoners that it is incumbent on the prosecutor to pursue this act of parliament in its very letter he has not done so he has not charged that they did it with a felonious intent to commit a robbery or that he meant to take his goods forcibly or violently I do not mean that the indictment should necessarily have found in it the words with a felonious intent to rob him or to commit robbery but this I contend it is clearly and indispensably necessary that upon the indictment there should be a clear and unequivocal description of an intent to commit an highway robbery now here is a clear description of an intent to commit larceny but I defy any man with legal notions about him to say here is the description of a highway robbery your Lordship knows there must be fear or at least there should be such a personal attack upon a man that a firm man might be put in fear and part with his property or have it taken from him and this indictment describes it to be with a felonious intent feloniously to steal take and carry away his goods that is a clear description of larceny My Lord I am ashamed to have taken up the time of the Court so long I conclude with submitting to the Court there must be a clear designation of an intent to commit a robbery Court I will first leave it to the Jury and if any doubt is entertained I will mention it to the learned Judges and if they entertain any doubt the case shall be reserved I think it would be more correct if the words by force or violence were added as to the other point if the Jury are of opinion the prisoners meant to beg and not to rob I shall direct an acquittal Mr Garrow My Lord I have no objection to your Lordship s purpose and I am sure that after what I have experienced so often of indulgence I shall be forgiven if I make this observation I observe that the mode in which it might be attempted to reconcile the indictment to the statute is this by taking in the whole description that might be collected out of the indictment but I shall take the liberty of submitting to this Court that you cannot look further back than beyond the word intent I take it that the other is a distinct part of the offence that is the assault in a forcible and violent manner of demanding money the other part the Jury are bound to find namely that it was with a felonious intent t o rob that feloniously and against his will and by force they took the goods therefore it seems to me as if it was impossible to couple the two parts of the indictment so as to make up one perfect whole to satisfy the act of parliament The prisoner Rooke called two witnesses who gave him a very good character and said he was a midshipman on board the Bellamont East Indiaman The prisoner Jordan called one witness who gave him a very good character JAMES ROOKE JAMES JORDAN GUILTY Transported for seven years

t17870912-47  717 HENRY STERNE was indicted for that he on the 4th day of June last in the parish of St Martin in the fields in a certain court and open place near the king s highway in and upon the Right Honourable Henry Somerset Duke of Beaufort did make an assault and put him in corporal fear and danger of his life and feloniously did take from his person and against his will one badge called a George made of gold and silver and a certain precious stone called an onyx and divers diamonds set in and upon the said badge value 500 l the property of the said Henry Somerset Duke of Beaufort A second count changing the said Henry Sterne with feloniously stealing on the 4th day of June last the said badge theproperty of the said Duke of Beaufort privily from his person The Indictment opened by Mr Garrow - and the case by Mr Fielding as follows May it please your Lordship and you Gentlemen of the Jury the crime which you have now to enquire as it is imputed to the prisoner at the bar you have collected from the indictment which has been stated to you by my learned friend and it will call upon you for two distinct considerations first whether the transaction will amount to the crime of a highway-robbery or if not to that whether to the offence of privately stealing from the person of the Duke of Beaufort Gentlemen the heads of the evidence which I shall presently lay before you will be comprised in a very short compass for as the transaction was of a very short duration and the detection of the criminal almost instantaneous these facts will be necessarily short that will constitute your enquiry Before I state them I cannot help suggesting to you the public importance of this prosecution prosecuted as it is by a personage of the most exalted rank against an offender of a very marked description Probable it is that this instance of the effective administration of justice may be universally known and if on the result you are convinced of the guilt of the prisoner as probable it is that awful solemnities will attend that example to which he must be doomed Gentlemen truly lamentable indeed it is to reflect on the miserable situation of this metropolis infested as it is now and has been by such swarms of offenders banditties assembling together no place however sacred secure from their encroachments the church itself infested the palace of the Sovereign every avenue of this metropolis wherever you can pass none of those places are secure from these depredations which are carried on with such a front of audacity where they assemble together in such numbers that even at day you are not secure and at night if you happen to be returning home you are alarmed and afraid of some attack on your person I do not mention these circumstances to touch your feelings I have have had the honour of seeing some of you before I know the manner in which you have discharged this duty Gentlemen if the laws themselves are defective for the security of our persons we can only lament it but if in the execution of those laws by the inferior magistrates there is either a want of vigilance or activity we have a great right to complain and I am but too much afraid we have that right for if there was a proper activity to prevent I am sure that measures would be effectually adopted for our preservation Our theatres particularly that form the nurseries of these creatures might surely be guarded and watched in a very different manner and I am afraid the unhappy wretch now at your bar owes his present miserable situation to the want of that vigilance Gentlemen I shall now proceed to state to you that evidence which is the foundation of the present prosecution - Prisoner My Lord I humbly request you will order this servant out of court Court Certainly Mr Fielding Gentlemen on the 4th of June last which you know was the birth-day of his Majesty his Grace the Duke of Beaufort had been at court at St James s as he was coming from court when he came down into the first larger court not finding his servants ready his Grace made his way into a lesser court which they call the Kitchen-garden-Court there looking for his servants he stood in a situation where as a carriage was drawing up his Grace found himself suddenly pushed about in a very extraordinary manner and the prisoner at the bar and another person immediately near him and who were the people who pressed upon him the Duke turned to them and asked them what they meant and though they must have seen his Grace with his ribbon about his shoulders and must have known his rank they gave him a very extraordinary answer including a question Whydon t you see the carriage coming the Duke turning about the men left him his Grace happening to put his hand to his side where the George was suspended at the end of the ribbon he found it was gone he immediately called to one of the marshal-men that he had lost his George one of his Grace s servants immediately arrived and hearing what was said he saw two men going off he immediately pursued them and took them both by the collar one man was in black the other was the present prisoner at the bar he told them what he suspected the prisoner at the bar seemed to put on a front of indifference and boldness the servant suspecting him more than the other says he you have got it in your pocket and instantly rushing his hand into his pocket he brought from the prisoner the very George that was taken from the Duke so that you see as to the outline of the transaction as to the theft by the prisoner there can be no doubt Gentlemen it is necessary in order to constitute the offence of a robbery that the person from whom the property is taken should be previously put in fear what that degree of fear may be will come better from my Lord than me as to the other offence that of privately stealing the law in its administration has been at all times and especially in the construction that has been put on that statute the offence of privately stealing being a capital offence whereas the stealing unaccompanied with that circumstance is within the benefit of Clergy the Courts have always been attentive to the merciful circumstances and extended their constructions favourably extremely far indeed but I conceive in the present case that there will be no doubt at all as to that degree of charge being brought home to the prisoner the Duke himself was not apprised of this till the property was gone therefore it was taken from his person clearly and demonstratively without his knowing any thing of the matter therefore privately In many of the offences that have been brought forward here and where there has been agitations of law I conceive the Court never went further than this that where the person himself may not have known of the thing yet some person connected with him does as for instance if goods are stolen out of a shop though the master may not see the goods taken away yet if another person has seen it that will differ extremely from the present case and I conceive without any farther observation that no advantage can be derived to the prisoner from that consideration I shall therefore proceed to call his Grace to tell you the story His Grace the DUKE of BEAUFORT sworn Mr Garrow Will your Grace be so good to tell this story what passed - As I was coming from Court on the 4th of June my servant informed me that my carriage was in the inner court I went towards the inner court under the gate-way there a carriage coming by I found myself surrounded by several people after the carriage was gone I putting my hand to my side to feel for my George I found it gone the George was suspended by the ribbon I immediately said aloud I have lost my George and the next I saw of it was in my servant s hand which was in about a minute my servant then had hold of a person but I cannot swear it was the prisoner he had hold of a man Had your Grace seen the prisoner at all before your servant produced the George - No I had not You had no recollection of his person - None at all Did you Grace perceive the George taken from your person - I did not You did not know that you had lost it till you put your hand down to your side - No I did not Was there any person about you very near to you immediately before you missed it - Several persons were very near to me I have had the possession of the George since I have it now Produced Court Is this the George your Grace had to your ribbon that day - It is Your Grace is able to say that positively - Positively Is your Grace sure you had it when you came out of the palace - I am sure I had it when I was in the gate-way Mr Silvester Prisoner s Counsel Your Grace was not at all alarmed I take it for granted - No otherwise alarmed than by being pressed There was a great croud there - Several people I believe there is always a great croud there on a birth-day to see the people - Certainly Your Grace did not observe the person of the prisoner - I had not Had you observed the persons of those that were close to you - There were two men in black that were taller than me close to me Was the prisoner in black - I do not know he was in blue at the justice s Your Grace s idea was that the person in black had committed the robbery - I said two persons in black stood by me Did your Grace call out to stop those persons in black - No Court The prisoner was not one of them two - No Prisoner I beg to refer to the copy of the examination for his Grace said there that one of the men in black had his George Court Did your Grace on the first examination charge on suspicion either of these men in black - I did not THOMAS WILLS sworn I am servant to the Duke of Beaufort I attended his Grace at court When you first saw the Duke what was the matter that first engaged your attention - I heard his Grace say he had lost his George What happened immediately upon that - His Grace said it is one of these men there s a man in black pointing to the two men in black Were the two men in black - No one in blue and one in black when they came up to his Grace I heard his Grace say he had lost his George pointing to the two men one of these men was a man in black his Grace said there is a man in black but he said before one of these two I ran after the men immediately they were running away into the Secretary of State s yard into the first passage on the right hand I ran after them I saw the men run into the yard I saw them turn into a narrow passage I saw them in the passage and ran up to them Were there any other persons accompanying them or only them two - Only them two I then put my hand towards the man in black s pockets and felt nothing I immediately put my hand to the prisoner s pocket and he shied clapping his hand to his pocket and shied I immediately took him by the collar with my right hand and put my left hand into his right-hand coat pocket and pulled out the George William Shipman the marshalman was there I kept fast hold of it I brought the prisoner and delivered the George to the Duke with my left hand and had hold of the prisoner with my right You have no doubt of course of the identity of the prisoner - He is the same man I never quitted him from the time I took the George out of his pocket till he was put into the black hole As soon as you heard the Duke say he had lost his George your eye was very shortly turned to these men - Directly they were running away Mr Silvester The first thing you saw or heard was his Grace saying he had lost his George and pointing to the two men saying there is a man in black - The prisoner was in blue What became of the other man - As soon as I took the George out of the prisoner s pocket he made off The fact is that the man in black made his escape and ran away - He ran away immediately Court You observed nothing before you heard his Grace say he had lost his George - I did not You did not see it taken - No WILLIAM SHIPMAN sworn I am one of the marshal-men who was attending at the palace on the king s birth-day I saw the prisoner apprehendded I saw his Grace standing waiting for his carriage to go home I kept the further gate in Cleveland-row and I saw people rather I thought surrounding his Grace and I walked down for fear any thing should happen I thought as they knew me it might rather deter them from going down the moment I went down his Grace said that he had lost his George I told his Grace I was afraid there were suspicious people about and I came on purpose and I asked if he could describe any of them says he there is a man in black just gone that way the footman came up that moment and he heard him mention the man in black and he pursued I saw a man in black and another in blue that was Mr Sterne the men were both running we ran as hard as we could the servant came up and took the George out of Mr Sterne s pocket Mr Garrow Had you observed Mr Sterne before the Duke came out of the palace - I had not I never knew the man before he was secured and taken to the black hole I took him myself I never quitted him Did you see the George taken from the Duke - No I did not see the George till it was taken from the prisoner Court Which of the courts was it in - I think they call it the stable-yard Is that in St Martin s parish - Yes Mr Silvester You was up rather before the servant - Nearly together Tell us exactly what it was his Grace said to you - He said he had lost his George and I said I was afraid there were some suspicious people and asked him to describe any one I would search them What did his Grace then say to you - He said there is one in black just gone that way and directly we ran Therefore after you had desired his Grace to describe the person he said there was a man in black gone that way - He said he had observed a man in black near him Were there any more people in black at that time near you - No Sir I did not see any thing more particular but seeing these men run we did not follow any body else Thomas ran up and felt the pocket of the man in black then says he it is here one of them has it and he took the George out of the pocket of Mr Sterne Court to the Duke Was the ribbon cut - It was not it was taken off by untwisting the diamond knot Shewn to the Jury Court to the Prisoner Do you wish to make any address to the Jury by way of defence Prisoner I only submit it to their consideration Mr Silvester Did not your Grace s sword-hilt get intangled in a coach-wheel at the time - No not the hilt the end of the sword was intangled in the wheel Mr Silvester to Shipman This George was taken from the outside coat pocket was not it - Yes Not from the waistcoat - No Prisoner My Lord and Gentlemen I hope the great rank of the prosecutor and the illiberal manner in which I have been treated by the papers will only tend to operate in the minds of the Court in my favour Court Undoubtedly the Jury will divest their minds of every prejudice as they ought to do I see a Jury from whom you have nothing to apprehend Sir Court to Jury Gentleman the prisoner is indicted on two separate and distinct charges included in one indictment there are two counts in the indictment and there are two charges not only separate and distinct but extremely different I may say opposite in their nature for the circumstances that support either the one or the other of these charges expressly exclude the possibility of the other the first is the offence commonly known by the name of a highway robbery which is a taking from the person either by actual force and violence applied to the personwho is robbed or by putting him in such fear as induces him to part with his property that is the general idea and description of a highway robbery and that is the offence charged in the first count of the indictment The second count charges an offence which appears on the face of it inconsistent with the former charge for it is stealing the same property privately from the person of the Duke of Beaufort which is always so laid as not to be perceived it therefore clearly excludes all idea of a highway robbery for it is either taken by force or the effect of fear that necessarily supposes that the person must perceive the violence or the impression of fear and must see the person that takes the property and the evidence most clearly and unquestionably applies to the latter for there is no circumstance of violence whatever spoke of by his Grace the Duke or any of the witnesses and to be sure the evidence which appears to have been very correctly given does certainly prove that whoever was the hand that took the George from his Grace the Duke of Beaufort stole it privately and therefore it comes within the second charge of this indictment You will observe in your consideration of the evidence particularly that I state whoever was the hand that took it because in the construction of this law which is a very severe one making it a capital offence to steal property even of a very small value privately from the person of a man without any personal violence to him which can concern his life or safety it has always been taken in favour of the person accused and as this act of parliament deprives the person of the benefit of his clergy it does not extend in express terms to persons aiding and abetting the commission of the offence The construction therefore that has been put on this act is that the hand alone who takes the goods is guilty of the private stealing In stealing privately in a shop the law has been otherwise taken because there it is expressly mentioned Gentlemen I am happy in this opportunity of stating the law in the presence of three learned Judges who will correct me if I have mistated it The next thing that is suggested to you by the prisoner was what I should have mentioned to you that there are two circumstances which you ought to lay wholly out of your consideration neither the high rank and justly respected character of the prosecutor nor any supposed notoriety of character in the prisoner ought to make the smallest impression on your minds you are to consider the prisoner in the light of an innocent man taken up on grounds of suspicion for having committed this offence and you are to judge on the evidence against him as you would against a stranger or your neighbour If you are of opinion that he committed this fact whatever his former character might have been it will be your duty to find him guilty if on the contrary you think that on any part of the charge he is not guilty whatever impressions may be raised against the prisoner it will be equally your duty to acquit him Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence and then added This is the whole of the evidence I have already stated to you that the evidence which is very clearly and distinctly given leaves no room to doubt that the George was privately stolen from his Grace the only question consistent with the evidence is whether you are satisfied that the prisoner was the man who actually so took it the circumstance of finding stolen property in the possession of a man is always considered as evidence to shew that he was the person who stole it and in itself simply considered it is also evidence that he was the person who stole it in the particular mode in which it was stolen whatever that may be if goods are stolen out of a house by means of a burglary the possession of those goods unaccounted for especially if under circumstances that raise additional suspicions and very recently after the fact committed is evidence not only that the party stole the goods but that he committed the burglary in that particular manner unless something to thecontrary appears so in a highway robbery the possession of a watch or whatever property is evidence that he took it in the manner in which it really was taken so with respect to this offence if nothing to the contrary appears the finding property which is privately stolen immediately after the stealing in possession of a man who cannot give any account of it is evidence that he privately stole it but that evidence may be explained like all other evidence and therefore it is for you to consider whether in this case under all the circumstances that have been stated you give that effect to the evidence which simply is the inference of law from it which is that the prisoner Sterne in whose possession the George was found within little more than a minute from the time it was taken from his Grace s person was the very hand who took it from his Grace or if he was not if it was taken by the man in black though in that case the prisoner is guilty of larceny equally guilty of the stealing with the man who took it yet under this act of parliament he is not guilty of private stealing you are therefore to consider whether you are satisfied that the prisoner was the hand that took his Grace s George if you believe the facts there seems to he no doubt but he was concerned in taking it but if you are of opinion he was the hand that took it you will find him guilty of the whole charge It is not perhaps a case where you should lean without all reason to make an inference against the evidence but if you find any just ground to doubt whether the prisoner was the hand that took it or whether the man observed by his Grace might be the hand who took it and hand it over to the prisoner which is the frequent mode of committing these kind of robberies then you will find him guilty of the stealing only According to your opinion on that fact your verdict certainly ought to be if you are clearly satisfied the prisoner himself took it you will find him generally guilty if not you will find him guilty of stealing only The Jury retired for sometime and returned with a verdict NOT GUILTY of the highway robbery GUILTY of stealing but not privately Transported for seven years Tried by the first Middlesex Jury

It was half after one in the middle of the day How long were they coming up to you and pushing you at the time they took your watch how much time did it take up - About a quarter of an hour Court That is a long time they might have done it in much less time I should think will you venture to swear that in the course of a quarter of an hour when they were shoving you about that you can swear to their persons so as to know them again - Yes You will positively swear that they are two of the six men - Yes Did you observe which of the six it was that pulled your watch out of your pocket - Yes I caught hold of him it was the prisoner M Carty the man in the blue jacket the first time I caught hold of him I got the watch from him Was the other man with him -

Yes Of course there were a great many more idle people looking on besides you - Yes And on such occasions every body was shoving here and there and so on - Yes It is a part of the fun of the day to push and shove and throw dead cats and make it as inconvenient as possible -

Last night in the Old Bailey So I thought what was it that Freeman said to you last night in the Old Bailey - He did not say any thing at all he said I should be here to day And he told you to swear there had been a good deal of shoving about - No he did not When did Freeman tell you that if you swore there was some shoving that would get two forty s - No such thing Do you know there is any reward - No I do not know there is any reward You never heard it - I did hear it Who was it told you - Several people Who are they - Those that were with me in the publick house in Lombard-street And they told you though you lost your watch if there was no force and no shoving about there would be no reward but if there was there would - They did not say so What did they say - They said if you are sure of the men I did say I am sure of one of the men that took the watch from me then they said I should consider about it and I should not swear any thing more than what was true that was the thief-taker Who told you you should have your share of two forty pounds - My Lord I am sure you heard me distinct enough now answer me what do you say do not you understand me - No I want to know who it was that told you that if you convicted these two men of a highway robbery you should have your share of two forty pounds rewards - There were a great number of people Pray Sir did Freeman never tell you that in your life - He said nothing yesterday only he said I must come to-day here and I should get the trial That is if you would be sure of the men and if you would swear that they shoved you - No Speak the honest truth has not Freeman told you if you swore that these men shoved you about you would have the reward - No he never said any such thing to me only to be here to-day Who gave your instructions for the clerk to prepare your indictment lay in the office - I do not know Upon your oath do not you know who it was - No Recollect yourself was it not Jacob Freeman who wrote down the instructions for the indictment - Nobody Will you swear that nobody wrote down the instructions look at these honest gentlemen and give your answer -

A watch which was picked off the ground the bottom of Queen-street on Lord Mayor s day last I saw it picked up a labouring man picked it up that was standing close by I do not know his name he did not mention his name at the time but some how or other his directions were lost Has that watch been in your possession ever since - Yes it is in the same state it was when I received it The watch shewn to the prosecutor and deposed to Prosecutor I know it by the seals there is no particular mark on the watch itself there is a blue glass in one and a green glass in the other on the blue seal there are three lions and on the other side there is a man and on the other there is a freemason s seal I lost that day such a watch and such a chain and such seals I swear they are the same that was taken out of my pocket When the prisoner M Carty according to your account had taken the watch out of your pocket what became of it - He took it out and I saw it hang in his hand he gave the watch through his right hand tothe prisoner Hartman afterwards it was found on the ground How soon afterwards was it taken up - It was found directly I do not know who it was that found it From whom did you receive it Mr Freeman - Freeman As I had hold of the prisoner Hartman I heard the watch drop I could not stoop myself therefore another hand picked it up the prosecutor had the other fast and the prisoner Hartman s hand was clinched the moment Roberts laid hold of him on one side I laid hold of him on the other at that moment the watch dropped and the glass broke I did not see M Carty I know nothing of him Mr Garrow Roberts is another thief-taker - I do not know what he is I am a constable He belongs to the insurance office in the city - He certainly is a thief-taker because he took the prisoner Which of the shops do you belong to - I am constable to his Grace the Duke of Bedford I belong to the public office in Bloomsbury Then you are the common runner of an office - Yes Sir I am a constable How long have you been a runner belonging to that office - Two years and a half I take it for granted you have had no conversation with the prosecutor Mr Harman about any reward - No This man is not forthcoming that picked up the watch - No Do you know whether any body gave any instructions for this indictment - I gave the instructions we were all together I gave the instructions to the clerk and he took it In writing - In writing Who wrote it - I believe Roberts wrote it I am not sure whether I wrote it myself For a highway robbery - No doubt of it I dare say as you are only a late constable since May last you know nothing about rewards - Yes I do very well I know this that in case the men are convicted the county certainly are to pay that sum And you are to have your share of that sum - Most undoubtedly I know no other way of doing it but as a capital offence That you swear - Yes I do swear so How often have you attended here - I have attended here I suppose these four or five years Upon your oath do not you know if these men are only convicted of stealing without force it would not be capital and there will be no reward - I saw the force I told my Lord Mayor so and I put my hand up to my breast at the time that I have sworn to-day is the same if the men were to be acquitted of the force there would be no reward but I saw the force committed I do not come here to talk about the reward I come here to speak the truth of the robbery I know this that if I indict a person I should indict him the right way I desire an answer to my question do not you know that if these men were not indicted for a highway robbery there would be no reward - No to be sure there would not If they were indicted for a simple larceny there would not - No not for ten-pence Ten-pence what do you mean by ten-pence - Did not you say simple larceny I did not say perit larceny now Mr Freeman if he was indicted for privately stealing there would be no reward - I saw the robbery committed - ROBERTS sworn On the 9th of November I was going down to the bottom of Queen-street there was a mob of people assembled together and I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner contending with each other I asked what was the matter and the prosecutor immediately said he had lost his watch I immediately pulled Hartman out of the crowd Freeman came and assisted and we took him up to a public-house the prosecutorfollowed us and said it was his watch I did not see the watch taken up I did not see the other prisoner there he was taken before the Lord Mayor and the prosecutor swore positively to him he said he was not the man who took the watch out of his pocket but it was another man shorter than him and he should know the man if he saw him and that the man who took it gave it to Hartman and that Hartman dropped it as soon as he saw me this was said in the public-house Court These men seem to be pretty much of the same size now did you see the other man in company with Hartman at this time - No I did not when I saw Hartman I knew him for some time I did not look for any body else I am a person employed by the proprietors of the General Insurance Office in Cornhill Court Was there a great croud -

I do not know that I have I never said any thing about what he was to say I told him that if in case he applied to the Court for his expences I dared say they would allow it him I never told him of 80 l I will swear I never talked to Freeman about the reward I have told him there are rewards paid What reward did you tell him - I told hiw in case a man was convicted of a highway robbery there would be a reward of 40 l When did you say that - I cannot say I might have told him such a thing but not about these two men but I will not swear positively I might PRISONER M CARTY s DEFENCE I was not at the place I had no shoes on that day PRISONER HARTMAN s DEFENCE I had no work and I went to see the shew and a parcel of men shoved me against this man The prisoner M Carty called two witnesses to his character BOTH GUILTY Of stealing but not violenty To be transported for seven years Tried by the London Jury before Mr Baron PERRYN

Yes in the passage some time after five That place is not very light of course - It was light enough I take it for granted it was very much crouded - Very much crouded Did it occur to you to see any lady near the prisoner at the time - No I did not I do not recollect in particular I believe there were women there Can you in the middle of this croud take upon you to say that the prisoner was absolutely the next person to you - I can for this reason because he spoke to me and while he was pressing against me he told me there would be a great croud and that we had better edge towards the door It did not occur to you perhaps to see this circumstance You did not see him speak to any lady there - I do not recollect Did you hear any lady next him ask what o clock it was - I cannot recollect Did you see him pull out his own watch to tell any lady what it was o clock - No he did not I am sure he did not while he was engaged with me I believe the prisoner was searched by Macmanus - I believe he was Nothing was found upon him - Nothing belonging to me You was before the magistrate - I was You said there I believe very fairly that you did not know that the prisoner was one that took your watch - I could not swear positively that he took my watch Mr Silvester Are you enabled from the observation and the conversation that passed between you and the person next you to say whether the prisoner is the man that was next you or not - That is the man Court Was this a night that Mrs Siddons acted - No Sir it was a night that Mrs Farmer acted Mr Schoen I understood you that at the time you lost your watch was the exact moment when the pit-door was opened - Yes Court Were a number of people behind you - There were they were pressing to get forward I put the question to you directly did it appear to you before you felt the hand at your pocket that the press was occasioned by the crowd of people by endeavouring to get into the play-house - Sir before the door was opened the prisoner and another man pressed very hard against me one on each side of me so hard that my hands were raised up At the moment of the door opening which naturally increases the press at that moment did it before you felt the hand at your pocket occur to you any thing else than that the press was occasioned by the people crouding to get in - I felt the hand at my pocket some time before thedoor was opened and I endeavoured to make way Did not it appear to you that the persons next you had other persons next to them and pressing upon them - A great number but those two persons were so situated I think it was impossible that any other persons could have done so Jury Did you feel any blow on your head at the time your hat was pulled forward - No If you will give me leave to put my hat on I will shew you Court If you please Sir Puts on his hat It was tumbled in this manner throws it off over his face it was occasioned by some small force that was behind me it occurred to me that it was on purpose PATRICK MACMANUS sworn I am an officer belonging to Bow-street I was at the play-house the 2d of December I know the prisoner I was in the passage leading to the pit The first thing that took my attention was hearing the prosecutor crying out he was robbed and I rushed forward to the place where he stood and I found the prisoner at his right-hand and the other man Conolly on the left I caught them both in my hands I said to a man hold this fellow for I see a watch in his hand that was the prisoner Now I will not swear that I saw a watch in his hand but I swear I saw something like a watch-chain hanging down When I laid hold of him he immediately raised his hand his hand was down before Court His hand was shut apparently with something in it - Yes in this manner Clenched Mr Silvester Was any thing hanging down - To the best of my knowledge there was but I cannot say positively I think to the best of my knowledge I saw part of a chain hanging down in his hand It is a very material fact for you to recollect - I will not positively swear it First did you see any thing at all hanging out of his hand - I really think there was part of a chain hanging out of his hand Does your doubt apply to whether there was any thing or whether it was a watch-chain are you positive as to there being any thing in his hand - I think I did see part of a watch-chain in his hand Are you sure you did - I really think I did I am very positive I saw something but I will not swear it was a watch-chain Are you sure you saw something - I am certain when the gentleman laid hold of Conolly that was on my left-hand he got away from him and ran across and whatever was in the prisoner s hand he took it out and ran away through the pitpassage and got off I saw him put his hand to the prisoner s hand and take something out and run away immediately I cried stop him he has got the watch and with that the prisoner at the bar pulled out his own watch immediately and said this is what I had in my hand - this is what I had in my hand Are you sure that was what the prisoner said - I am sure of it Then I took him to Bow-street and the prosecutor went with us Jury Do you think at the time he took out his own watch and said this is what I had in my hand that he had time to put that watch in his pocket again - I cannot say You found nothing upon him but his own property - Nothing belonging to Mr Bellingham Mr Schoen This was about five in the evening in the pit-passage - It might be a quarter after or twenty minutes There was a very great crowd - There was a great crowd You rushed forward on this call and seized two men - Yes One of which made his escape the other did not - No You are pretty well known Macmanus - Yes A man could not at all be ignorant ofthe cause of your seizing him - Not in the least I take it for granted that if a man s hand was down the best thing he could do was to have dropped the watch - I do not know Sir They know very well what to do in these cases Jury I understood you that when he held out his hand you saw him give something to the hand of the other - No Sir I saw the other put his hand to the prisoner but I did not see any thing pass Mr Schoen You do not say that you saw any thing pass from the prisoner - No And in point of fact you do no not know whether the prisoner might not put his hand into his pocket after - I do not know what he did with his hand after Prisoner When the prosecutor was before Mr Bond I asked him if he could say whether I took any thing from him he said no he could not I never offered to go from Macmanus I was crouded as much as Mr Bellingham was and I did not rob him any more than he robbed me The prisoner called ten witnesses who gave him a very good character GUILTY Of stealing the goods and monies but not violently from the person Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr RECORDER Transportation See summary

I believe he is here He sat me down in Charles-street Covent-garden about half-past twelve o clock Q You could not have been all that time going there had you been drinking - A I had but knew what I was about - I may be mistaken in the time I went into the watering-house in Charles-street and treated the coachman my watch was then safe in my fob I was going out and was surrounded by a set of people just at the door A person came up to me and knocked me in the breast merely to push me back it was not a violent blow He snatched my watch and ran away - they held me fast to prevent me running away Every one in the house was concerned in it They came round me and held me back that I should not run after the man They came from the taproom directly as I was going out I pushed them back and ran after the prisoner He had got very near to the bottom of the street towards Tavistock-street and as he turned round a hackney coach at the bottom of the street he flung the watch into the coach Q Had any of them hold of you at the time he snatched the watch from you - A Yes They had at the very time it was taken from me I was not able to defend myself and property I did not stop to pick the watch up but pursued after the prisoner and caught him Just as I caught hold of him two men came up and forced him away from me Q Had you sufficient view of his person to be able to say the prisoner is the man - A I saw him looked him in the face and know the prisoner was the man I knew him by a rising on his nose which I particularly noticed He got away and I took the two men who rescued him to the watch-house They were bailed out As soon as I gave them in charge I came outside and the beadle said Should you know the man if you saw him I said I should He took me to the house where I was robbed - it was the sign of the Marquis of Granby When I got in I turned round the prisoner was sitting in the room and directly as he saw me he dropped his head and covered his face I went up to him lifted up his hat and pulled away his hand He then said I am not the man who took your watch Q Before he said so had you given any intimation what was your reason for looking at him - A No I had said nothing I am quite sure he was the same man I caught before I gave charge of him to the beadle I have not recovered my watch it was new and worth 3 l I attended at Bow-street next day and he was committed Q Have you been able to see the parties who confined you to prevent your following him - A Yes I have seen several of them here As I gave charge of the prisoner to the beadle they surrounded us and said he wasnot the man and he should not go to the watch-house In going from the house they came round two or three times and tried to rescue him Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS Q Where did the men surround you - A At the Marquis of Granby I first laid hold of the prisoner at the house I took the two men to the watch-house The beadle returned with me and coming from the house and while in the house the men surrounded us and tried to rescue him Q You say when the beadle had the prisoner some men surrounded and tried to rescue him where was that - A In the house I did not say at the watch-house that my watch was worth seventy guineas the men round said so but I did not Q On your oath where you not insensibly drunk - A I certainly had been drinking but knew what I was doing at the time If I was so I could not have done what I did I described the man who robbed me as having a light coat on and two belcher handkerchiefs round his neck and told the beadle I should know him by the rising on his nose I think he was taken about one o clock which was about three quarters of an hour after he got from me I never entertained a doubt of his being the man I should know the men who surrounded me I never saw the coachman before I did know the man before he took me from Cheapside to Covent Garden Q Do you recollect taking your watch out when you was on the box with him - A I do not I know it was safe when I was in Bishopsgate-street about half-past ten o clock - I was at the Four Swans public-house Bishopsgate-street and walked alone from there to Cheapside The prisoner is a coachman but I do not know his number JOHN FITZGERALD I am a watchman of St Paul s Covent-garden On the 4th of April I was in Charles-street and saw the prosecutor there - I was standing at the end near Russell-street - the Marquis of Granby public-house is about the middle I heard Watch called and when I came up the prosecutor laid hold of a man - there was a crowd of men about him assisting the person he had hold of The prosecutor said the prisoner had drawn his watch from him Q What sort of men were they - A They appeared like hackney coachmen I laid hold of the man The prosecutor gave him to me and left him with me while he went to look for his watch in the coach Q You did not come up till the watch was thrown into the coach - A Yes He was rescued from me but I do not think I should know the persons who rescued him and I cannot say the prisoner is the man for his coat was over his head - I could not notice him when he was rescued I called Stop thief and sprang my rattle but could see no man The prosecutor called me to the coach - I told him to take the number Some men behind me said Take the coach to the green-yard - the prosecutor was there at the time they got quarrelling and he gave charge of them I took them to the watch-house I should know them again if I saw them Q Did the prosecutor appear to be able to hold the man - A Yes He held him till I took charge of him - he was tipsy but appeared to be sensible he walked stood and spoke very well After this there was a cry of Watch and I assisted in conveying the prisoner to the watch-house Q Did the people about suffer him to go peaceably or attempt to rescue him - A No not as we took him from the house to the watch-house We pulled him along for he did not wish to go The watch-house is in the market Cross-examined Q The Marquis of Granby public-house is a watering-house - A Yes I did not know the prisoner before that night - I was not in the public-house When I took him he had a light coloured coat on much the same as he has now I did not notice it - I cannot say whether it was like it or not COURT Q How long was it from the time of the alarm till the time you took him into custody - A I think about three quarters of an hour A man might change his dress in that time JURY Q Was any attempt made by other people to rescue him - A No He struggled himself JAMES BETHELL I am beadle of the parish The prosecutor came to the watch-house said he had been robbed and brought two persons in for attempting to rescue the prisoner from him - they were detained Q Did he appear to be insensible - A He appeared agitated from the robbery and talked very fast - he did not appear incapable of giving an account he had his senses about him I went out with him and asked him if he should know the man who had robbed him he said he should and that he had a rising on his nose He said he had been robbed coming out of the door of the house I walked with him under the Piazza and into the first public-house near Bow-street - he said that was not the house We then went to the Marquis of Granby public-house and he said that was the house - it is kept by a widow woman I knocked at the door but it was some time before it was opened I told the prosecutor to go in and look well about the taproom but not to notice me as if I was in company with him I went in in about two minutes the taproom was full of people He looked round and pointed out the prisoner who sat in a box in the corner of the room with two or three coachmen round him The prosecutor leaned over the table put up the prisoner s hat and I believe asked him what he had done with his watch he said he had not got the watch Two or three coachmen said What do you mean by saying he has robbed you I went up and asked the prosecutor if that was the man who had robbed him he said Yes I told the prisoner he must come out as the man had given charge of him Q About what time was this - A About a quarter past one o clock - he did not come out I said if he did not come out I should call a watchman in to bring him out by force A man on the other side of the room said Why that shews you are guilty if you don t go out He then came out and as we were going towards the door they tried to rescue him from us and when we got out we were surrounded by coachmen and others who tried to rescue him Q Should you know any of them again - A I think I should know some of them I called Watch and the last witness came up among others Q Was there any further attempt to rescue after that - A Yes As we went along Tavistock-row by the New Hummums I had hold of the prisoner by the left side and the watchman on the other - I think it was another watchman that had hold of him not the witness They laid hold of him and pulled him about but I said if they did not stand back I would knock them down we got him to the watch-house He had a rising on his nose as the prosecutor described Cross-examined Q What had he on - A I cannot say I do not recollect the prosecutor s description of him He said the watch was worth about 3 l at Bow-street - I heard nothing about the value at the watch-house Prisoner s Defence I am innocent and leave it to my counsel and witnesses JAMES BARTLETT I am watch-house-keeper of St Paul s Covent-garden and was on duty when the prisoner was brought in I think it was after one o clock The prosecutor gave charge of two men for rescuing a man - he appeared to be tipsy Q Do you mean fresh or stupidly drunk - A I believe he was not so far drunk but he could recollect what he was doing - he appeared agitated at first When the prisoner was brought in I believe he had on the coat which he now wears the two men were held to bail at Bow-street for an assault I believe I should know them again - one of them is a printer The prosecutor said himself that the watch was worth seventy guineas COURT Q Was you at the watch-house when he first complained of having been robbed - A Yes I did not hear him describe the man -

I saw no more of them after they went out to the main street I saw Smith who goes by the name of Kit Lips and Hall who goes by the name of Davis and another young woman whose face I did not see I heard Holland say to them Get on or go on he used an improper word and said Get on let the **** lay or something of that sort Mrs M Ardell came round the corner in a quarter of an hour or ten minutes - and in consequence of what she said I opened my yard-door and went out into the waste ground and there saw Randall lying on his back - a bundle lay at the back of his head in a belcher handkerchief quite torn with cowheels or neat s-feet and cucumbers -

I said Dan can t you lift him up He said Hold your tongue he will get up by and by let him be or something of that sort I went home and afterwards saw Randall laying on the waste at the back of my house he was five or six yards from their house -

but they are the three women I did not hear any noise in the house Cross-examined Q Randall was ten or twelve yards inside the court when his hat was taken off not in the main street A No not in the street there was no man with the three women when they passed me -

I live on my income On the 2d of November I was passing up Goswell-street towards Islington about six o clock in the afternoon - the gas-lamps were lighted I had three ladies in my company - two were walking some distance behind and one had my left arm - my watch was in my fob when I came within two or three yards of Bell-alley I observed the prisoner standing against an iron post in the entrance of the alley the moment I came level with the alley he made a spring and seized my watch-chain the snatch broke the bow of the watch and he got the chain it was done with such force that he drew my fob up he did it so suddenly that I could not stop his arm I immediately pursued after him and just at the entrance of the alley several persons surrounded me and attempted to stop my progress - he ran down the alley I cleared my way and ran after him calling Stop thief - he had got some yards before I got up to him there is a thoroughfare from the alley into Golden-lane but he took a turning to the right and then into Great Arthur-street I had lost sight of him in turning the corner but was certain the same object presented itself to me the moment I turned - it is impossible I could catch sight of any body in turning but the same person and I say I am quite certain I never lost sight of him when he got into Great Arthur-street he fell - there was nobody near enough to him for me to mistake him I made sure of taking him then but just as I got up to him I fell myself - he got up and I got up and pursued some of his companions were running behind me at the time but I outrun them he ran down Great Arthur-street turned to the right then inclined to the right again into what is called Pump-court I lost sight of him in turning the corner there and he ran into a house just as I turned the corner of that court a voice or two cried out He is gone into this house I went into the passage and a man apparently a blacksmith came out and said Shall we go up I said Yes a woman put her head over the bannisters and said There is nobody here that don t belong to the house - I insist upon it you don t search my house without a warrant I then staid down stairs and shortly after a man came in and went up stairs - that was not the prisoner in a short time two persons came down together - I was then watching just outside I instantly seized the prisoner who was one of them and said This is the villain who has robbed me I have no doubt whatever of his being the man Q Was the person who offered you his assistance at hand then A I do not know - there was a great crowd the people immediately cried out That is not him he belongs to the house the man who has robbed you has gone round the corner they immediately got round and hustled me I loosed my hold of the prisoner and he disappeared I saw him in Clerkenwell prison in about a week I had returned to Devonshire and come back again I was certain he was the man and have been certain of him from the robbery to the present time Q Setting aside the question whether he had robbed can you be certain he is the man whom you seized coming out of the house A I have no doubt of it and am certain he is the man who robbed me I had a full opportunity of examining his face I have not found my property Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Were the ladies friends of yours A They were I have not brought them here I cannot say whether the one who had my arm saw the man who made the snatch - she lives in St Martin s-le-grand I was a little alarmed I let her arm loose when I pursued the prisoner I cried out I am robbed or something of that kind the other persons attacked me after I was robbed I only lost sight of the prisoner for the instant as he turned two corners until he went into the house my brother has not interfered in the business It might be nine or ten days after that I went to Clerkenwell the prisoner was not pointed out to me - there were thirty or forty prisoners he was not at all distinguished from the rest I pointed him out immediately - there was no light in the alley ROBERT LOCK I am a special constable of St Luke s I heard of this robbery about two days afterwards - I made inquiry in Goswell-street and was directed to a person named Buckle in Arthur-street from information - I afterwards saw Mrs Buckle the landlady of a house in Arthur-street and about a week afterwards I and Harrison went to a house in Gravel-walk Blue Anchor-alley and found the prisoner in bed with a young woman - I went to search his clothes Harrison said Billy I want you the prisoner said What for Harrison told him for a bundle taken in Chiswell-street he jumped up out of bed and said I know that is a lie - I know what you want me for it is for a robbery in Goswell-street for the watchman told me the officers were looking after me we then said it was for that we sent for Buckle he brought a lad to the watch-house who said he was the man Cross-examined Q He said he was told he was wanted for it A Yes THOMAS HARRISON I was with Lock - his statement is correct THOMAS PEARLE I am fourteen years old and live with my mother at No 3 Great Arthur-street Goswell-street I work for Joseph Emms who is journeyman to Mr Townsend a paper-stainer I was sitting at tea with my mother between six and seven o clock and heard a cry of Stop thief I went to the door and saw some persons running down Arthur-street - I first of all saw the prisoner being chased - Mr Dowley was next to him close behind him and others were running behind him - I am quite sure of the prisoner - I knw him well before he ran into a house at the entrance of Pump-court the door is under an archway - I believe Mr Baxter keeps the house three or four people live in it Baxter is one Mr Dowley went under the archway and lost sight of him - I said He is gone up here and showed him the house he went just inside the threshold - I afterwards saw the prisoner come out with another man - Mr Dowley seized him and said This is the man who has robbed me two or three men rushed in between them Dowley lost his hold and the prisoner got away - I saw him again on the morning of the Tuesday week afterwards - I knew his name before and told the officers who it was and told Mr Buckle - I saw him when he was taken up at the watch-house and cannot be mistaken in him Cross-examined Q What part of the house were you sitting in A The ground floor in the shop -

I live almost facing Pearle - I was having my tea and heard a cry of Stop thief I went to the door and saw the prisoner in Great Arthur-street running towards our house - I am certain he is the man the people were all behind him running after him and when he came facing the house I ran - I did not notice Mr Dowley till the prisoner ran into the house - I then stopped Mr Dowley and told him he had run into the house I believe Baxter lives in the house - I did not see him run in but I was not a yard from him and he could not turn the corner as I heard steps in the house I told Dowley he had run in there - Dowley waited just at the step of the door and so did I another man went into the house and in two or three minutes the prisoner came out with that man - Dowley seized him and said This is the villain who robbed me I believe some persons rushed between him and the prisoner - Dowley lost his hold and the prisoner got away he turned the corner and ran towards Bridgewater-gardens - I saw him at Worship-street about eleven days after and am sure of him Cross-examined Q Have you seen the man here who came out with the prisoner A No - I had never seen him before there were a great many people about CATHERINE BAXTER I live with my father at No 7 Pump-court Bridgewater-gardens on the two pair of stairs On the day Mr Dowley was robbed the prisoner ran into our house - I heard a row in the passage ran down stairs and met him coming up he did not live there - I never saw him in the house before a short while after another man in a long coat who I thought looked like an officer came up he collared the prisoner and said This is the man I want he went down stairs first and the prisoner after him I did not see that man s face when he went down he said to Mr Dowley There is no man there - I saw Mr Dowley lay hold of the prisoner and say This is the man a woman who stood there said That is not the man who robbed you he is gone up the alley - I should know that woman again I have known the prisoner a long time by seeing him about Golden-lane he wanted to go into the one pair room but the man who lives there said You shan t come here the prisoner at that time was all over mud as if he had been on the ground the people rushed between him and Dowley and he got away Cross-examined Q How old are you A Fifteen years -

I ran down the whole extent of Bell-alley thinking the thieves were gone that way - I turned into the bottom of Arthur-street into Pump-court and found Mr Dowley surrounded by a number of people the man had at that moment escaped - I went in pursuit but without effect - Thompson and I came back searched the house in Pump-court but found nothing we saw the witness Baxter there - Pearle named the prisoner to me but with the noise I understood him to say Keane instead of Keevin or the prisoner would have been taken before when he was taken I took Pearle to the watch-house and he immediately said the prisoner was the man who the gentleman said had robbed him the prisoner said You know nothing about me THOMAS THOMPSON I know nothing except what Buckley has stated the girl described the prisoner to me Prisoner s Defence They are swearing false every one of them -

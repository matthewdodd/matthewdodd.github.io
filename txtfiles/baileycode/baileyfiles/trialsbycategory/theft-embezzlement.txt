I went out every morning to my business I was told he had a warrant out against me but knowing my innocence I never absconded He frequently met me and turned round to look at me and why not take me but no he had not then proved that inveteracy against me which he is so capable of When his partner died he knew his friends would enter an action against him for burning the old books and making new ones and at that time I did not countenance him as I did before and he did not take me to places of amusement as before I was appointed arbitrator between him and his partner I met him one night to investigate the books - he bought a new cash book and said Now I will do them for all their deepness - he got me to call over the sums - he entered the large ones in the new book and left out the small ones then burnt the book His poor partner was in a dreadful state of mind and came to the shop - he told him the concern was going to the devil and the business was worth nothing when it was worth 1000 l He frequently told me to turn him out of the shop When he came to enquire when his partner died and he found I would not countenance him he charged me with embezzlement I trust the Court will see this is as great a conspiracy as was ever heard of I declare my innocence WILLIAM GAUNT I am a surgeon and live in Grafton-street East Fitzroy-square I knew the prisoner about the latter end of 1820 He was confined for some months being lame -

our business was carried on in Wood-street and at the City-road When the prisoner received a cheque or money he was to enter it in the payment book and deliver the money to the cashier every evening who gave him a receipt for it - he was to make the entry in the cash-book he had no further duties to perform with respect to entries there On the 1st of December the prisoner returned after a week s absence - I then told him there had been discoveries made which impeached his integrity we had heard from some parties that they had got his receipts for money for which he had not accounted - he went up to the wharf and there he escaped Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS Q Todd was the person to whom he was to render the account of moneycollected in November - A Todd was not the collector - Veal had been appointed he was to account for the money to Veal and Veal to give it to Todd If he gave his account to Veal or Todd it would have been sufficient My orders to him were to go round to the customers with Veal and account to him It would not have been a branch of his duty if he got a draft to have got it cashed His father had given a bond when he entered our service but I believe his name was not to it - his father was then dead Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q He might pay a cheque in change - A Yes if he got a cheque for 10 l and had to take a larger cheque he might have paid that away and I should not have expected an account of that but should no doubt of the larger one If there had been a trifling damage to pay of a few shillings I should not have permitted him to settle that without its being submitted to our inspection MR DOBSON This is my draft looking at it and this is the receipt the prisoner gave me -

the rest was in cash it might have been silver if requested I have not entered the year the note was dated I believe there are 10 l notes issued every year - we only enter the dates when we receive them not when we pay them away ANN MOORE I live with my father who keeps the Cumberland s Head public-house City-road I received this note and gave change for it in the month of November but I cannot say on what day - I changed it for the prisoner or his servant I knew him perfectly well before - here is the name of Moore on it but that is not my writing - this 11-23 is my writing it signifies the 11th month 23d year Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS Q Do you know who brought the note a man or a woman - A No but if I had not known the parties I should not have changed it I knew where the prisoner lived - he was a housekeeper I delivered the money to him or his servant I cannot say which - his servant was a female I had known her before her name was Jane - I have seen her in his house ROBERT LAMBERT I was clerk to the prosecutors I examined the portable book the cash-book and ledger for the express purpose of seeing if this account was entered - I did this about a week before they were destroyed in February last I examined them diligently and no trace of this account was to be found - the portable book was partly in the prisoner s hand-writing the payment book includes the accounts of many years The entries of the 19th of November are in the hand-writing of Veal - the prisoner had access to that book and could have corrected any inaccuracies Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS Q Is there any one book which has been saved from the flames relative to accounts but this - A No the cash-book and ledger were destroyed - the ledger was made from the cash-book - and the bills or invoices There are entries here not made by Mr Veal - it was not the prisoner s business to make entries here it was Veal s duty to do it If Veal had made a mistake he would have found it out by the cash in his pocket If the prisoner had received in any one day 100 l made up partly of cheques and partly money and brought the whole of the amount it would have been all that was required - he had no right to change a cheque for payment The amount on the 19th of November was in eight payments 83 l 19 s 3 d all in bills or cheques except 6 l 6 s 8 d Veal was there at the time of the investigation and assisted in it If the prisoner had received a cheque for 14 l 7 s 9 d and gave it in change he should have accounted for both in the book Prisoner Q Was the practice previous to Mr Veal s coming to enter both the names in the book - A It ought to have been the credit given to the customers did not depend upon this book but the cash-book the ledger could not have been creditted from this book - it must have gone to the cash-book which had the entries from the collectors portable book which the prisoner carried about with him - it might be half a sheet of paper it afterwards remained as a document of the house I found several of these portable books in the prisoner s desk which had dates to them he should have made them out every day I do not know that I had every one he wrote JOHN GARDNER I was ledger keeper to Messrs Langton and Co I remember the prisoner leaving on the 1st of December I examined with the last witness the various books to see what entries were made - there was not in the cash-book any entry of this money paid by Dobson - I cannot speak to the other books Mr Veal continued there till the 26th of February and all that time there were enquiries going on - it was Veal s duty to have made the entry in November last if he had received the money - if he did not he could not have made it if he had received the money and not made the entry it would have been the prisoner s duty to have asked him for it MR TODD The prisoner never accounted to me nor Mr Veal for this 14 l 7 s 9 d - he had an opportunity of seeing this book every day every sum he paid me he had my signature for Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS Q From what did Mr Veal make his entry in the cash-book from these memorandums - A Yes When he had a day s money to account for he was to give an account to Mr Veal but I cannot tell whether it was by word of mouth or memorandums - but if he brought money Mr Veal should have entered it or if he brought it to me I should have entered it I have been many years a book-keeper and sometimes make mistakes Mr Veal was very correct if he made a mistake of 1 d he would have set it to rights I think it quite impossible he should have made a mistake of 14 l 6 s 9 d -

he said he had written a letter to his masters to try to settle the business I asked if the letter was gone he said No it was in the hands of a friend and he should stop it I made no reply to that Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS Q Did not he tell you his master had got his bond and that he kept away to avoid being arrested - A No Prisoner s Defence I have very little to add but with regard to changing the note I think I can explain that Though I was not to collect I used to settle the damages up to that time and if there was any trifling damages I was authorized to pay them and if I had paid them out of any money of my own I might change a note to reinburse myself - there was never any memorandums passed between Mr Veal and me when he received money I have paid many hundreds of pounds without receiving any memorandums and it depended upon their entering it in the cash-book to exonerate me GUILTY Transported for Fourteen Years

we usually receive notice from the Exchequer to collect the bills advertised to be paid off - Mr Christmas was then directed to select them and make out a list of them from the different accounts of Exchequer bills and take that account with the bills tothe Exchequer office - they were delivered to him in September last for this purpose - he left our employ on the 18th of June last Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q I presume a number of these Exchequer bills are deposited at your house merely as security A Some are ours and some are merely for safe custody -

they are Exchequer bills of 1823 held by Messrs Hoares - the amount of two lists which I have is 475 400 l - they are numbered - the lists specify the numbers - the lists are sent to our office annually -

we have the old bills sent with the list I believe they have not been examined yet - the account was only delivered the beginning of this year - me amount of principal is 475 400 l and interest 14262 l here is a list at the back of the number and amounts of the new bills issued for them not giving the particular numbers but how many of each amount MR BRODRICK Q Is the receipt for the principal and interest of the old bills A Certainly MR LAW Q What is the memorandum at the bottom of the paper stating the amount &c of the new bills A It means that the party applied for new bills but we have nothing to do with that here is a memorandum at back denoting that the holder received new bills of the same amount for old ones JOHN HENRY LATHAM I am paymaster of Exchequer bills I paid off a number of Exchequer bills to the prisoner for Messrs Hoare on the 22d of September 1824 I delivered new bills for the old ones here is the memorandum which was given to the prisoner when the old bills were brought in for payment and on it is written the amount of the old bills and interest due thereon - principal 475 400 l interest 14 262 l he had in exchange three hundred and sixty-five bills of 1000 l each one hundred and twenty-nine of 500 l one hundred and sixteen of 200 l and two hundred and twenty-seven of 100 l - they were numbered from 3372 upwards Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q Did you see that memorandum made A No - the original book is here - the clerk who made the entry is not here MR SERJEANT BOSANQUET Q Did you compare the Exchequer bills delivered with any account A No I received the bills from the accountant with a label on them to deliver to Messrs Hoares I delivered them to the prisoner - he examined them and made no objection to them here is a book containing an account of the persons to whom the new bills are issued with their numbers - the prisoner is the person who received Messrs Hoares bills on the 22d of September - we always deliver bills of the same amount as we receive COURT Q Suppose I had three 1000 l old Exchequer bills if I wished six of 500 l for them could I have them A No we must issue the same amounts or pay in money - no money was paid on this occasion except the interest - I paid him a draft for the interest on the Bank and have it here it amounts to 14 262 l here is an endorsement at the back of it For Hoares and Co William Christmas MR HOARE This endorsement is in the prisoner s hand-writing The draft for 14 262 l was here put in and read WILLIAM WOOD paymaster of his Majesty s forces at Whitehall was called to prove the payment to the prisoner of a cheque upon the Bank on the 22d of September 1824 but had not brought the necessary documents for that purpose HENRY WHITING I am a clerk in the public drawing office at the Bank of England On the 22d of September 1824 I paid the prisoner an Exchequer draft of 14 262 l and another draft of 35 l 6 s 8 d I find that amount at the back of this cheque - it was on account of Messrs Hoares I gave him an order for the amount on Everingham who pays him in Bank notes Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q You gave him an order A Yes two orders one for Bank notes and the other for money the order is paid by the pay clerks Q What does the name Christian on the back of this mean A I have written the name Christian for Christmas but I knew him very well I read the name on the draft as Christian MR SERGEANT BOSANQUET Q Did you see him write his name on the draft A No but I saw him come from the desk with it I never knew but two instances in which the person receiving the money did not write his name on the cheque for the sake of reference if necessary bankers clerks do it as a matter of course and if a stranger comes we ask him to do it I cannot be certain that the prisoner is the person to whom I paid it but I should pay it to nobody who did not answer to the name WILLIAM EVERINGHAM I am pay clerk at the Bank of England On the 22d of September 1824 a note ticket drawn by Whiting was presented by the bearer Christmas - I cannot swear that the prisoner is the person I paid the ticket and when delivering it I ask the person s name and if he had not answered to the name of Christmas I should not have paid it I read the name as Christmas I always knew the prisoner by that name I paid him fourteen notes of 100 l each I took a memorandum of it from our books made by a clerk under my direction at the time When the ticket is presented I give it to my companion who enters it and passes it to me - I call over to him the notes which I pay - he enters them in the book and I check them - he calls them over to me as a double check the notes are paid in regular numbers - if I say fourteen of 1000 l he says perhaps 64 to 76 1000 l COURT Q Are the notes entered one by one A No my Lord the books are printed to correspond with the numbers - we pay them in following numbers if a mistake was made we should discover it in the next entry - in this case Numbers 6483 to 6496 dated the 1st of September 1824 were paid MR LAW Q Without reference to your memorandum can you from memory state what notes were paid A No The regular course of cashing this cheque for a banker would be to give him fourteen of 1000 l one of 200 l and three of 30 l unless it was desired in a different manner MR ADOLPHUS Q Do you recollect the prisoner himself coming for this money A No but I have every reason to believe so I should not pay it to any person unless I thought they came from Messrs Hoares I have known him some years and knew his name ROBERT COTTLE I am cashier to Messrs Hoares I have the book containing an account of the Exchequer bills of the 22d September 1824 it is the book in which they are entered before they are entered in the Exchequer bill ledger here is an account of the new bills brought back for the old ones - the account of the old bills is in the prisoner s writing the entry is Exchequer bills dated 20th of September 1823 paid off 20th of September 1824 the total amount entered by him is 474 400 l Here is the dividend book in which the bills paid off are entered - the new bills are entered into the Exchequer bill ledger they are distributed into a variety of accounts in the other book Q Have you an account in the prisoner s hand-writing in which he gives credit for the total amount of principal and interest received for these bills A Yes here is an account in his writing of the old bills and each person is debited for the new bills on the other side the amount of debits for new bills is 474 400 l the amount he credits for principal and interest is 488 632 l the difference 14 232 l is the interest He has entered 1000 l short in bills and 30 l short in interest Here is Miss Wood s Exchequer bill account there was in her account an old Exchequer bill of 1000 l No 10 588 it is marked in the prisoner s hand-writing as having been paid off to the 20th of September 1824 and her account is not credited for any new bill in the room of it - the interest on that bill is exactly 30 l if it had been paid off she would have had credit for 1030 l principal and interest it was the prisoner s business to give her credit for that amount - she is not credited for principal or interest Q Is it customary when a draft on the Bank is received from the paymaster of the Exchequer to carry that draft for payment on the same day A Certainly not - he ought to have brought this draft to the banking-house and another clerk would have to take it to the Bank the next day There are two clerks named Ryder and Lee one of whom would have to receive it Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q Are all the pages in that book in the prisoner s writing A Yes - The entry of the old bill on Miss Wood s account is dated the 22d of September 1823 If it had been delivered to her there would be written against it delivered on such a day but he has written against it paid off on the 20th of September 1824 he should have entered a new bill on the credit side If she had received the bill she must have given an order for the delivery of it if it had been paid off in money the cash would have been carried to her general account which is not here I never quarrelled with the prisoner I never write for newspapers Q Look at this paper is it your writing A Yes I do know that I wrote any more of that sort - I might have written two but will swear I did not write three I sent one to the Times newspaper - I sent them no other communication and know of none being sent that was sent to a newspaper-office I sent a notice to the Herald also and I went to the Times office I had some conversation with the publisher but cannot say whether I left one there - I called no where else I thought it so black against him that the public ought to know it Q You sent this notice to the papers Mr Christmas for robbing Messrs Hoares will be publicly examined at Bow-street this evening A Yes that is it I was not directed by any of our firm to do so I expect no advancement by his fall I said nothing at the Times-office but that he would be examined that night I never furnished materials for any of the articles which appeared there Q The interest entered in the book tallies with the principal sum entered A Yes The entry is made on the 22d of September the day on which they were paid off - the interest is added to the principal to make the two sums tally - there is 1000 l principal and 30 l interest omitted but here is a list in his hand-writing in which he enters both those sums This particular bill is entered there here is a list of Exchequer bills which should tally with the other but it does not The first amounts to 475 400 l it is a rough copy made out from the bill-book In the other list the bill No 10 588 is omitted MR SERGEANT BOSANQUET Q Where does that list come from A From the banking-house the casting up makes the amount 474 400 l and interest 14 232 l but it is cast wrong - 1000 l principal and 30 l interest although there is but two items to cast up if the bill had been paid off the money would be entered this bill is not entered to her account any where MR BRODRICK Q On your solemn oath are not the figures 474 700 in another person s writing A They are very like his figures Q They are one of the two sums which would make the 475 400 l A Yes I can swear to all the rest of the figures MR LAW Q Here is 474 700 l - have you any doubt of the figure 7 being in his writing A I cannot swear to that particular line being his but to all the rest - thecasting up is in his writing and that is where the inaccuracy lies Both the totals of principal and interest are his writing GEORGE MELMOTH I am a clerk in the banking-house I have examined the Exchequer bills with the prisoner s list I have examined all the books and find all the bills correspond except ten of 100 l they make 474 400 l but it should be 475 400 l to tally with the old bills The 1000 l bills tally the deficiency is in ten of 100 l Q You could not tell the number of each bill A Not as to the actual number but I compare the number of bills belonging to different people with the new bills and find ten of 100 l short I have compared to see if the new bills tally with the old ones the entries in the accounts are the prisoner s writing the new bills are certainly every one entered in his writing Q Tell me the names of any person in whose account the deficiency will appear A I can mention them if obliged but had rather not Q Well point out the accounts and do not read the names A Here is one it is Miss Wood s - 1000 l is deficient I will state others without mentioning names here is an account in which the old bills were four of 1000 l three of 500 l five of 200 l and sixteen of 100 l in return for them there should be the same number and amount - instead of which I find five of 1000 l three of 500 l five of 200 l but only six of 100 l there is the same sum in total this is in his hand-writing MR LAW Q There is a deficiency of 1000 l in Miss Wood s account A Yes and the actual deficiency is in ten bills of 100 l JOHN TURNER WATTS I am a stock-broker On the 22d of June I received from the prisoner and sold for him three Exchequer bills of 100 l dated the 20th of September 1824 On the 25th of June I sold three 100 l of the same date and on the 14th of July four more of the same amount and date Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q Had you money transactions with him to a considerable amount A Yes many thousands he acted as agent for people - he did not state for whom he sold those bills MR MELMOTH re-examined Q Will you refer to the clearing book - are there any entries of the prisoner s of notes paid in on the 22d of September 1824 A I find an entry amounting to 13065 l 6 s 8 d it is paid in two notes of 30 l each among others MR SERGEANT BOSANQUET My Lord we will give up the charge of embezzling the 30 l The prisoner being called upon for his Defence entered into a long detail desiring the Jury to banish from their minds any prejudice which they might have received from the statements in the public press - stated that his character was unimpeachable and that he was high in the confidence of his employers after he left them and contended that had he been guilty of the charge he should not have left as while he continued in their employ detection would have been impossible but entered into no explanation of the facts deposed to MR HOARE re-examined I am certain it is not our practice for any draft of the Exchequer Bill office to be presented at the Bank on the day it is dated GUILTY Aged 29 Transported for Fourteen Years

t18261026-250  2041 GEORGE JOLL was indicted for embezzlement Mr BRODRICK conducted the prosecution MR WILLIAM COOK I am in partnership with James Cook and James Gladstone - we are Manchester warehousemen and live in Cheapside The prisoner was our principal clerk and had the entire charge of the cash - it is part of his duty to receive money on our account - he had been with us eight years and was in our confidence he left on the 19th of January this year I had desired a clerk to go and examined an account at Camberwell - the prisoner knew of that and next morning absconded leaving most of his things behind him I have a shop distinct from the partnership concern in Great Warner-street Clerkenwell the prisoner kept a daily cash-book which I produce in which he should enter cash as he received it- here is an account we call the Warner-street account to which he should have given credit for any money received from that shop if he received a cheque he should write our banker s name across it and pay it in if he received a cheque of 22l 11s he should enter it as a cheque on the credit side of this account there is no such entry here I have looked it over and so has the clerk - from that time to the present there is no credit given for it he balanced the daily cash-book every night - if credit had been given it would have altered the balance Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q You had access to this book at the warehouse as well as at Warner-street A Yes - and to all the books and if I had suspected him I might soon have discovered this our accounts are sometimes 4000l or 5000l a day - it is not very possible that a small sum should be omitted - the prisoner was seldom sent out to collect - he generally went out on Mondays Q Has not this cheque been brought to account at some subsequent time A No - I swear that he received this cheque eleven months ago Q And did not he carry a larger sum to your account that day A Yes - 30l but not as an equivalent to this - we generally settled accounts with him daily the accounts of this day and the next are signed by me my younger brother had paid this cheque at Warner-street MR BRODRICK Q From and examination of the books can you swear this cheque has never been brought to your account A I can COURT Q Supposing he kept the cheque instead of sending it to the bankers where would he keep it A In his cash-drawer in his desk but it had no business to be kept it should go to the bankers ELIZABETH HAWES In January 1825 my name was Cooke - I was then at the Warner-street shop I received a cheque of 22l 11s from my brother George who was then at that shop and gave it to the prisoner - I told him there was a cheque from Warner-street this was on Monday the 24th of January 1825 COURT Q How are you enabled to say it was the 24th of January A I made a memorandum in a small book which I have here - reads - 24th of January 1825 a cheque for 22l 1ls - E Cooke which means that I received it that day and I always paid it the same day Cross-examined Q Some of these items are signed by John and some by you does that prove who received the money A This book was generally sent with the money MR BRODRICK Q Will you swear you did not keep this cheque a week A Yes the entry is signed E Cooke - many are signed G Joll that was when the book was sent with the cash to Cheapside - I signed this entry because I did not take the book - I always paid the money to the prisoner - some entries are signed by Floyd but I never gave him money MR WILLIAM COOKE This book is generally kept at Warner-street to be sent with the money to Cheapside to be signed - the items signed Floyd intimate that the money was received by him to give to Joll - my sister s signature indicates that she paid it to Joll - there is an entry of money being received by Joll that morning but not this sum - the signature only indicates that the person received it - and it is Joll s business to account for it in the cash-book JOHN CHARLES GRAY I am clerk to Sir James Esdaile I paid this cheque for 22l 11s and 15l in country notes on the 24th of December 1825 - it is dated the 22d of January 1825 - I paid for them a 30l note No 14 731 dated the 7th of November and 5l and the rest in cash JAMES TEWSLEY I am clerk to Messrs Jones Lloyd and Co On the 24th of December 1825 621l 2s was paid in on account of Messrs Cooke and Gladstone I do not know who by - but among it was a 30l note No 14 731 dated the 7th of November MR COOKE The prisoner generally took the cash to the bankers but not always - In the general cash-book there is an interlineation of this amount - I first saw that the day the prisoner was apprehended JURY Q Did he on the 24th of December pay more into the bankers than the account amounted to A Yes more than that particular day but not more than the whole account Prisoner s Defence When I was placed in the counting-house I found the books much confused - there was no making out the accounts - I told Mr Cooke it was necessary to have more clerks he said I must get through them as well as I could I have stated to him the possibility of errors - he said the customers would point them out our accounts were about 400 000l a year - I was alone except a boy to examine invoices we at times found money due to persons and Mr Cook has directed me to make the account balanced as it was more likely they were correct than us - as to this cheque it appears to have been mislaid and when found was applied to their own account MR COOKE I do not recollect his ever stating this to me - I never said the customers would point out the errors WILLIAM GLAISTER I am in the prosecutor s employ I have heard the prisoner complain of the difficulty of carrying on the business but not in Mr Cooke s presence - he said to me that the books were behind-hand there are three clerks - I know the books were in a confused state when one clerk left - three of us now keep the books - I first went there in 1824 MR COOKE When the prisoner first came we had two clerks and afterwards another as our business much increased and his salary also - he at first had 40l a-year and at last 130l - I knew he was at his father s in the country in February and when we wanted him we found him Four Witnesses gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 33 Transported for Fourteen Years

we are wholesale grocers and live in Rood-lane Latham was employed in our service as clerk or servant - in that capacity he occasionally received monies on our account he with others had access to the cash - if we had occasion we kept a considerable sum of money by us but our usual habit was to pay our Bank notes into the Bank before three o clock on the day we received them the prisoner was employed in paying deposits on sugars and clearing the duties we were in the habit of balancing our cash every night - here is the waste-book in which the prisoner made entries when we are about to clear sugars it is our usual course for the clerk to take the money to the custom-house to clear the duties - here is an entry on the 15th of September in Latham s writing in the waste-book - in which he states the sum necessary to clear the duties was 740l 2s 10d - he has also entered in the cash-book on the 15th of September Customs for East-India sugar 416l 5s 6d which dicates he had taken that sum from our drawer to pay the duties - there would then be wanting 323l 17s 4d more than he had taken - I do not of my own knowledge know where he got the rest - he went out on the morning of the 15th of September at eleven o clock and never returned On the 17th of September Singleton came to Rood-lane about half-past eleven o clock in the morning which was Friday he said his name was Singleton and brought this letter in his hand and gave it to my brother but not in my presence my brother handed it to me I do not know the hand-writing - Singleton was present when my brother handed it to me as having received it from him Letter Read The following is all that I know concerning the unpleasant business which has just taken place - Mr Latham called on me at the Tower I think last Tuesday and in the course of conversation and in the presence of another young man said he had thoughts of taking a trip over to France for a short time walking towards his home he made a proposal to me saying that if I would come over with him for a few days he would bear the expenses I saw him again the next day when he renewed the subject and I agreed to go with him as far as Boulogne Not having had leave from the Office and as he said he had also not got leave he said that it would be necessary for fear of being found out and thereby be disappointed in going to do it as privately as possible He requested me to leave a feigned name for him at the French Ambassador s - I gave my own name and address I took no things with me except a change of linen for as I intended to be such a short time away I did not think it worth while to take more I met him at eleven o clock in the City when he said that as he had not taken any clothes with him he would buy some things which he did and even made me take the loan of some We got the passports about two o clock and left London for Dover in a postchaise at seven we got there about five o clock and when we got up in the morning at seven he took out his pocket-book Up to that time I had not the least suspicion nor had not the least idea that he had so much money with - He then took from his pockets a quantity of sovereigns and gave me between seventy and eighty to put into mine saying they were too heavy to carry altogether I then asked him how much he had altogether when he told me nearly 600l I think it was he said I was very much surprised From what he said afterwards I had no doubt remaining but that it was all his own Previous to this he had written a letter to his uncle and to my astonishment he said that he had told him in it that he did not intend coming back to England I begged of him to come back to London directly and give up the money he had taken which he refused to do He then pressed me to accompany him and on my talking to him of the madness of doing so he only flew into a rage Directly after that and seeing plainly that nothing I could say would induce him to give up his mad scheme I kept him under pretence of going to see about the packet and took the first conveyance to London Not being able to get a place in the coach at that time I came nearly all the way in a post-chaise and have only just arrived From any blame attached to me in this unfortunate business I trust I shall be able to clear myself I have got 71l in sovereigns ready to give up directly I fear as it is so late that I shall not be able to see any of your Gentlemen this evening nor do I know in what name to address this CHARLES SINGLETON To the Senior Clerk 23 Rood Lane Upon this I sent for an officer who took him into custody Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS Q Latham is your apprentice is he not A Yes he has been with us nearly seven years - our general way of business was for him to make entries in the general cash-book of what he drew and he kept a petty cash-book himself - it was the course of our business for him to make up his accounts every evening - he made entries in the book of what money he took and settled every night he enters the amount of cash he takes out and the parties he pays it to - he has no business to take out more than he wants his duty is to say what he wants before he takes it it never happened to my knowledge that he had to return any cash - he has entered the 416l 5s 6d only Latham was my apprentice individually and was clerk to the firm Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q When Singleton brought you the letter did he give up 71l A Yes THOMAS WEBB WHITMARSH I am a partner in the firm of Warner and others on the 15th of September Latham applied to me for a cheque to make up a particular sum of money which it was his duty to pay as Customs for East-India sugart - his is the cheque I gave him it is for 173l 17s 4d which was the sum he applied for it was necessary for him to get that cashed before the duties could be paid here is his own name written on the back of the cheque which indicates that he received it at the Bank it is drawn on the cashiers of the Bank of England drawn by Jacob Warner Sons and Co on the 15th of September 1826 and indorsed F J Latham Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS Q Was he to pay the duties with it and not to return it to you A No to pay the duties WILLIAM POPHAM GATTY I am drawing clerk in the Bank of England I received this cheque but I cannot say when 170l was paid in Bank-notes and the rest in cash it is not our practice to pay in Bank-notes but to give an order for them to another office I gave the order for the payment of this cheque to the bearer of it and these minutes on the front of it show that I gave the order for it to be paid in that way Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS Q Does the person get a ticket from you to receive these notes from another person A Yes I do not know who brought this cheque CHARLES EDWARD WALLER I am a clerk in the Bank of England I produce a ticket which I received on the 15th of September drawn by Mr Gatty it is for 170l to be paid to the bearer in the name of Latham for which I paid five 20l notes and seven 10l notes we work in pairs and Mr Hawkes enters the notes in the book as I call the names dates and numbers to him and give them to the bearers of the tickets I delivered the notes specified in this book to the bearer of the ticket and gave the description of them to Mr Hawkes JOHN HAWKES I took down correctly the number and description of the notes mentioned by the last witness there were five 20l notes from 17 554 to 17 558 dated 14th of August 1826 and seven 10l notes No 18 618 to 18 624 dated the 18th of August 1826 I receive the ticket Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS Q Did Waller call over the notes to you according to the usual course of the Bank of England A Yes and I cheque the numbers with him and am able to say that this book contains the exact numbers of the notes delivered out MR ANDREWS to MR WARNER Q This young man was apprenticed to you to learn the trade of a grocer A Yes for the general purposes of the business I do not think he ever was employed in collecting cash he had occasionally to draw for money and to receive cheques for the payment of duties he never was employed to go out and receive monies unless any of the other clerks were ill but if people brought money to pay their accounts he was to receive it if he happened to be in the way MR BRODRICK Q Was it his duty to receive money for cheques A Yes BENJAMIN HOE I am a warehouseman in the employ of the prosecutors In consequence of some directions from them I went to Dover - I arrived there on Saturday morning the 16th of September - I placed myself on the pier and saw Latham I told him he must come home with me As we were walking towards the inn I asked him where the money was he said Here it is and handed me some notes and sovereigns I asked if that was all he said all except what Singleton had got I asked him who Singleton was he said a young man who came down with him and he believed he was gone on board I inquired for an officer who took Latham in charge we then went to the packet but it was gone I then went with Latham on board a vessel to go to Calais but we could not make Calais and we got to Boulogne and travelled from there to Calais we found these two portmanteaus at the Custom-house at Calais Latham pointed them out I brought them up to London with Latham the money I received from him was 564l and he said he thought 705l was the whole he had taken but he could not account for the rest These are the notes and sovereigns I received from him -

it was Latham to the best of my belief who paid for them I had nothing to do with Singleton but they came in together and went away together I gave the note to my father to get change Messrs Bonds are our bankers COURT Q Where was Singleton while you dealt with the other A In a different part of the shop - they were there a quarter of an hour MR LAW Q Have you since seen the coat which you sold A Yes in a portmanteau it was to fit Latham GEORGE TAYLOR I am clerk to Messrs Bonds the bankers On Tuesday the 19th of September I received this 10l Bank-note No 18 618 dated the 18th of August 1826 on the account of Mr Radford but I cannot say from whom ROBERT WYER I keep a portmanteau warehouse in Oxford-street On the 15th of September the two prisoners came to my shop about twenty minutes before twelve o clock -

they had two portmanteaus and a few paper parcels - they asked for dinner and a room to wash and dress in the porter took the articles out of the coach I took hold of their portmanteaus and found they were empty I told my master of it our coffee-room is not a public room we have only some gentlemen who dine in it and the lodgers they washed and dressed and then dined in the coffee-room about four o clock immediately after dinner Singleton went away in a hackney-coach and ordered the coachman to drive to Charing-cross - he returned in about an hour and ordered the bill which I took him and he paid it with a 10l note which he took from a roll of notes which he had in his pocket - I think there were from fifteen to twenty-five notes - I took the same note to my master and he gave me change I gave the change to Singleton I think the amount of their bill was 1l 15s and they told me to deduct the amount of postage to Dartford which was 1l 7s they left in a post-chaise at a quarter before seven o clock to go to Dartford Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Did they sit in the coffee-room the whole time A No they went to a room to dress before I saw Singleton take out the roll of notes - Latham asked if I could speak French - I said I could not - I did not see Latham hand any notes to Singleton nor did I see Singleton hand any to him - he put them into his left-hand trousers pocket - I did not count the notes he had in his hand but I think there were from fifteen to twenty-five Re-examined Q Can you undertake to say that there were several notes in the roll A Yes my attention was so directed to them that I can speak to the circumstance positively FRANCIS HUMBERT I am the keeper of the Hydepark hotel I received from the last witness a 10l note on the 15th of September to the best of my belief it was the prisoners who were there at that time - I gave the waiter change out of it - their bill was 1l 19s 6d - I put the note into my cash-box in my bureau - I did not mark the note - I took a great deal that day - I gave a Mr Hughes change for 100l note the same evening and the next day I paid my cook a 10l note COURT Q What notes did you give to Mr Hughes A A 50l note three 10l notes and one 20l note one of these 10l notes might have been the one I received from the waiter NATHANIEL MACKLIN I am cook at that hotel On the 16th of September I received a 10l note from Mr Humbert and changed the same note with Miss Oliver CHARLOTTE OLIVER On the 17th of September I received this 10l note from Mr Macklin - I wrote his name on it at the time - it is No 18 620 dated August 18th 1826 - I paid it to Mr Alexander Millar ROBERT MOSS I am waiter at the George and Bull Inn Dartford On the evening of the 15th of September the two prisoners came there in a post-chaise about nine o clock - I received from Singleton this 10l Bank note No 18 619 - I made inquiries of the post-boy what to write upon the note and from his information I have written Herbert s hotel Hyde-park - I believe it should have been Humbert s hotel HENRY BINGLEY I am in the Ordinance-office in the Tower Singleton lodged with me and left my house on a Wednesday in September - I did not see him again till I saw him in confinement which was four or five days afterwards - I had no knowledge of his going away - I do not know whether he took his clothes as they were in his room I know Latham by sight but I do not know that I ever saw him with Singleton my son was unfortunately acquainted with Latham - I have seen him in the Tower parading about and he has come to my house to see my son but mostly staid at the door Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q At the time you saw Latham lately has he been in deep mourning A Yes I believe Singleton left his property at my house I never looked at his wardrobe but I believe he was well equipped as a gentleman - he was as respectable and correct a young man as I ever knew - he lived with me six or seven months and I loved him next to my own child - he is in the Ordinance-office in the same situation which I first held and now I am second clerk there - he had no temptation from poverty to have committed a bad action - his salary is 90l per annum BENJAMIN HOE re-examined When I brought the portmanteaus to town there were clothes in them I have seen them frequently - I locked one of them up I have had the key in my possession ever since it has been unlocked two or three times since in my presence and very possibly something may have been put into it which was not there at first without my seeing it this black coat was in one portmanteau Latham had a claret coloured coat on when I took him it appeared new I put it in the portmanteau - the one that was not locked had shirts and trousers in it JOSEPH RADFORD This claret coat I sold to the prisoner with some other things which are not here WILLIAM PLANT I sold shirts of this description to the prisoner but not being marked I cannot swear to them I can swear to this cravat which has a private mark on it Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Does the mark show any more than that you once had it in your possession A No we have sold many such I sold four of this description to the prisoners on the 15th of September BENJAMIN HOE re-examined I found two caps at Calais they were like these and were put into the portmanteau but I cannot swear these are them I did not see any more than two caps they were turned out on the table there and again in England COURT Q Did you see two oil-skin caps A Yes and a variety of shirts and cravats they appeared new they were clean and nicely folded up one piece of muslin was taken from the portmanteau at Calais WILLIAM BARNES These two caps I sold at one time ROBERT PARFET re-examined When the two prisonerswent away from the hotel Latham had a cap similar to this and Singleton had a hat they appeared quite new and were in a brown paper parcel when they came ROBERT MOSS The two prisoners had caps on when they were at Dartford which appeared the same as these JURY to ROBERT WYER Q Do you identify the portmanteaus as being sold to the prisoner or only as two that had been in your possession A These are the two I sold the prisoner s I know them because I put two white sticks in them which I never put before or since - the sticks are generally made of oak but that day I had no oak SINGLETON S Defence My Lord and Gentlemen I will not attempt to assert that I have not acted very indiscreetly and incautiously but of the crime I am accused of I am perfectly innocent and when you hear the evidence my counsel will bring I feel confident you will be of the same opinion - this young man had asked several other persons to go with him before he asked me and when he asked me I unfortunately agreed to go with him but I had particular motives for going as that part of my family to which I am most naturally attached live at Boulogne - the prisoner had given out that he was to receive a legacy at the death of a relation and a short time after he appeared in black and I supposed his relation was dead and yielding to his solicitations I accepted his invitation to go to France free of expense - he stated that he was going away without the leave of his uncle and he would not wish me to go back to the Tower - so he was to purchase some clothes for me as he said I could give him the money when I returned from France I got a passport for him in a fictious name as he wished me but for myself in my own name which I should not have done if I had known how he got the money I did not hear a word of that till I got to Dover and when I did I resolved on returning immediately - for this purpose I came by the van to Canterbury leaving every thing behind me - from thence I took a post-chaise and arrived in London on Saturday evening too late to go to Latham s employers but I forgot to mention that on my arrival at Dover I wrote a letter to my uncle excusing myself for leaving my office without leave and saying I was going to Boulogne and should return in three days the moment I got to London I wrote to a young friend requesting to know the name and address of Latham s employers he came to me on the Sunday morning at the coffee-house where I was gave me their names and walked with me to their residence I wrote to them the letter which has been produced but I wrote in great agitation and very hastily - I fear there may be some errors and omissions and it may not be so explicit as I could have wished I returned and wished Mr Warner to hear what I had to say intending to give a full explanation but he would not hear what I had to offer I met his brother and a friend who behaved in the most gentlemanly manner but Mr Warner ordered his warehouseman and another person to stand between me and the door to prevent my going and sent for an officer had me taken into custody and ordered the officer not to allow me to have communication with any person and that injunction was so strictly carried into effect that a letter which I wrote to my father was returned to me unopened - how far Mr Warner can reconcile this unfeeling and unjust treatment to a person like myself placed in this situation and denied the means of defence I do not know but I am innocent of the charge and have been anxious from the first to stand forward and clear myself MARK SINGLETON I am father of the prisoner I recollect his writing to me from Dover to state that he was going to Boulogne and he should be back in three days he has an office under government and if he were in any want of money I always supplied him - when he returned to London I saw him the same day THOMAS CAITHNESS I know the prisoner Latham I saw him in September - he was in black and appeared as if he had lost a friend - he said he intended to go to France and asked if ever I was there CHARLES COLE I am in the house of Messrs Sanderson and Co I have heard Latham say he expected something at the death of an uncle or when he came of acertain age I cannot exactly recollect what this was before last June HENRY BIGNOL I recollect Singleton wrote to me to procure him the prosecutors address - I went and accompanied him part of the way to Mr Warner s he told me he had a part of the money about him which he was gogoing to restore - this was on Sunday the 17th of September about twelve o clock - I have frequently seen Latham at our house and have heard him talk of what he expected in the presence of Singleton - I have heard him say he had an uncle JURY to BENJAMIN HOE Q At what time was Latham apprehended on the pier A About nine o clock in the morning - I did not make any application at any office at Dover or raise any hue and cry that Siugleton might have heard COURT to H BIGNOL Q When did Singleton return to town A On Saturday night as he told me I saw him on Sunday morning One witness gave Latham a good character and five deposed the same on behalf of Singleton The Jury retired at a quarter before five o clock in the after noon - after sending several messages to the Court who sat all night to receive their verdict stating that they could not agree in averd ict respecting Singleton - at half-past ten o clock next morning they were sent for by the Court they stated that eleven were determined upon a verdiet of Not Guilty as to Singleton but that the whole twelve could not and were not at all likely to agree JURY We find LATHAM - GUILTY Aged 20 But upon Singleton s case we are not agreed COURT The Jury having been twenty-four hours in attendance and near twenty-two hours charged with this case the Court feel they may exercise that discretion which in extreme cases is vested in them we have the power to summon a new Jury and this is now discharged Latham received sentence of Fourteen Years Transportation - and Singleton gave bail for his appearance next Session to take his trial

t18270913-7  1595 JOHN BOON DUTHY was indicted for embezzlement MR ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution JOHN THOMAS POCOCK I am a coal-merchant at St Bride s wharf Whitefriars The prisoner has been six or seven years in my employ - his duty was to collect money on my account he never accounted to me for 3l 14s 6d which was due from John Harris his duty was to enter it in his own book and hand the cash to the clerk here is his book - there is no entry whatever of that sum in it Cross-examined by MR LAW Q I suppose that you reposed confidence in him A Yes He had sold coals on his own account before he came to me and I believe he brought me three customers he was in the habit of taking orders Vender s tickets were not made out in his name since he has been in my service I allowed him 15l a-year for the business he brought I lent him 40l which he gave me his note of hand for three or four years ago I arrested him for that sum about the 23d of March immediately on my finding that he was doing wrong Q Did you not issue an Habeas against him on the very day he was going before the Commissioners to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act A My attorney had orders to prosecute him long before that - but I believe he was taken on this charge the day he was going before the Court - he entered in the book the figures of the money he received my son kept the other side of the book - the money was to be paid every night Q Was it not his custom to deduct his salary from the money he so received A No he had to collect some small rents for me and in one or two instances where he owed money to persons who owed me accounts - he here said I owe so much to the baker and you must take that as having been received by me I did not allow him to stop money which he had received against his salary - he always paid the cash to my son Q Was he not in the habit of stopping so much as being due to him A No he has been paid out of the rent money - as that was about enough to pay him if he had not received sufficient rent money to make up his salary I paid him the difference but that was confined to money received for weekly rents Q After he was in custody did you not go to him to make up his account A Yes I had then only arrested him I told him there was something wrong in his account I did not require an account from him but he sent to the wharf to say he would make up his account - we said we did not want it for we had found it out ourselves - he however sent an account which I produce - the sum in question is entered here this account was furnished afterwe took him on the criminal charge - he was brought here three or four months ago he would not be tried one Session and the next I was out of town - he had notice before he was brought here that we were going to prosecute him and the witnesses names were given to him - when I arrested him I had no idea of the extent this had gone to till we went round to the customers he was arrested on the 23d of March and brought here - I did not like to have the trouble of taking the weekly rent so I let that be till I paid his salary - I gave him 15l a-year instead of his selling on his own account he charged his expenses at the end of the half year and I paid him - he entered in the book whatever he received and gave my son the money but if he drew bills he gave them to me as they required my indorsement - the cash account was balanced every night - when I speak of an account between us I mean the rent account I gave him a house to live in as part of his salary I had frequently to give him 2l or 4l when we settled - I am sorry to say that he has seven children - he bore a good character and is a clever man MR ADOLPHUS Q Ought there to be entered in this book the sum of money which he received on one side and your son enters on the other side what he has paid A Yes he had two guineas a week a house to live in and coals and he charged his public-house expenses - the account he has sent me is in his own hand-writing some of the sums he has entered have been received two or three years back - none of them have been paid to me this amount of Harris is among them - here is upwards of 200l on this paper I have received none of it nor is any of it entered in his book - he was to take his salary entirely from the money received for rent if he received more rent than was due to him he paid me the balance and if at the end of half a year it was less I paid him the difference After I had discovered several sums which had been received he sent this account I suppose about 2000l a year might pass through his hands - Harris was not one of the customers he brought me JOHN HARRIS I am a buckle chafe maker I deal with Mr Pocock for coals and on the 1st of November I paid the prisoner on his account three sovereigns half-a-guinea and 4s he gave me this receipt for it - read I saw him write it Cross-examined Q Have you any recollection in what coin you paid him A I know there were three sovereigns half-a-guinea and 4s and I recollect his remarking that I had given him sixpence short - I said No that was half-a-guinea and he looked at it again MR ADOLPHUS Q It was a good deal of money for you to pay A Yes I seldom pay so much away LEWIS POCOCK I am the prosecutor s son I am not in partnership with him I am cashier - it was the prisoner s duty to enter in this book what sums he received - I enter on the other side the cash he pays he never accounted to me for 3l 14s 6d received from Harris - I remember this account being sent to my father we knew of the deficiencies before that Cross-examined Q How was he to make up any expences he had incurred A He was allowed that every half year he was supposed to pay the expenses out of the money received MR ADOLPHUS Q Would the account be regularly balanced if he kept money back A No his expenses might amount to 20l or 30l in a half-year - the account of deficiencies which he sent in amount to 200l - we have discovered more since MR LAW Q Beside this 200l here is 42l under the head of liabilities A That is my hand-writing - he calls those persons his friends and he had sold them goods in his own name that money is included in the 200l but then he says we can get that from them again - it appears he has given them a receipt in his own name The prisoner read a long address to the Court stating that he had been under considerable pecuniary embarrassments but although he was accused of embezzlement he trusted it would appear it was nothing more than a matter of account he had never intended to defraud his master of one farthing never having misapplied a sum with a criminal intention but only considered it as debt GUILTY Aged 50 Transported for Fourteen Years

it was his business to attend in the shop and sell goods we have private marks on the goods to denote the price when he sells goods it is his duty to make out a bill and give it to the next young man to sign with a letter -

I said I could not think of receiving any money whatever and immediately withdrew what amount he produced I do not know - it looked like notes Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q You understood him to mean he had not given you credit in his employer s books A Yes - I made that communication to Messrs Boyd they knew nothing about it before I gave the information THOMAS FRENCH I am one of the firm the letter F to this entry is my writing I never received any account from the prisoner of his having received more from Mr Mules than is contained in this entry we have received other money before but not near this date Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q Did you know of any advance of 50l made by the prisoner to Buck - A No he never communicated anything of the kind to me Q Did you not say Don t let Buck know that I know of it A I did not I do not know of his ever having advanced Buck money - I swear that most positively if I were in doubt about it I should say so it is my province to keep the cash book - I balance it whenever it is convenient to me - I have no stated period nobody balances the book but me - it is quite uncertain when I balance I had not done it between the 1st and 11th of April - it is not a very easy job I at times begin it and cannot finish I had not balanced since the beginning of the year but I have since the 11th of April the prisoner was never allowed to hold bills or money the moment he received them it was his duty to enter them in the cash received book and then bring them to the partners in their counting-house I have found fault with him for keeping cash even ten minutes Buck has dishonoured two or three bills I believe there was one due on the 4th of March and another on the 4th of April he sent some money on account of the bill stating that he could not provide the balance and requesting us to draw for it we ourselves provided what he was short - it was not provided by the prisoner I have had frequent communications with him respecting Buck s account Q Do not you know that the prisoner advanced him50l and you told him not to let Buck know that you knew of it A I remember nothing of the kind MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you ever tell the prisoner to keep or use the money he received from Mules to satisfy this bill of Bucks A Oh no certainly not I did not know he had received it when Buck s bill was due I could not detect anything wrong by balancing my books unless I was told it had been paid COURT Q What was the amount of Buck s bill - About 280l he provided 130l and I think a 16l bill I believe it came in a letter expressing his regret that he could not provide the balance and requesting it might stand over or be drawn for we sent the whole of the money to our banker s and took up the bill out of our own funds placing what he sent to his account the prisoner had nothing whatever to do with it he might have been sent to take the bill up I was quite ignorant of his having received more money from Mules than is entered in the book Prisoner I am sure I can bring to Mr French s recollection that about fifteen months ago Buck came and told me he could not take up his bill I said it was almost the first bill of his and I thought it might injure his credit with the house if they knew it - I advanced him the 50l myself I went into the counting-house and told Mr French he said Well if you have lent him 50l keep it to yourself you can get it from Buck better than us if he is aware that we lent it we shall not get if from him MR FRENCH I have some slight recollection of 50l being advanced about fifteen months ago I considered before that he was speaking of a recent transaction it was a matter that did not concern us at all and made no impression on my mind Prisoner s Defence I was not aware when I entered the Court that this charge would have been gone into first nor did I know this indictment would have been gone on with until Monday I was taken up on the 11th of April on a charge which I defy them to substantiate well knowing that one of the partners of the firm paid the money which they charge me with stealing they said at the Mansion House that this charge was sufficient for the ends of justice and they would not enter on that for 105l I do not believe they suppose for a moment that I took the 105l to appropriate to my own use to defraud them of it I solemnly declare in the presence of my Maker I never thought of defrauding them nor can they prove it before any Court let them bring forward any charge and I can defend it I have been upwards of fourteen years in their employ their returns are about 300 000l a year upwards of four millions and a half of money passed through my hands during the fourteen years and I never defrauded them nor had I any cause to be dishonest it is well known the first houses have bondsmen for their clerks but I had none my character was sufficient I had no tie - I admit I received the sum charged on the 29th of March - on the 11th of April I was taken into custody and had possession of 108l about thirteen days and after having served them faithfully for fourteen years I say it is very dishonourable to prosecute me on this charge I was not aware I had committed a felony by retaining that money - the first time I was aware of the circumstance it came from Mr Harmer himself I told him everything As to the first charge which I expected to be tried on I am certain you would have acquitted me I was told it was the only charge that would be preferred the prosecutors sent to me saying if I would plead guilty that was all they wanted but they must have a conviction - although in the eye of the law I may be guilty it was unintentional I have on one or two occasions lent the prosecutors money for a few days and they have lent me money once a customer owed them about 2100l about two years ago he was in difficulties I met him his father and uncle he said if he could get 500l or 600l he thought he could get through his difficulties I persuaded his father and uncle to lend it to him and wished to place that money to the account of my employers and got some persons who threatened to arrest him for 260l to take my acceptance before it became due he was a bankrupt they threatened to arrest me and my employers advanced me part of the money I have perhaps in a dozen cases advanced money in this way we collect our debts every month - a person has paid me 150l and I have paid my employers on their account 300l deducting the interest which is allowed for prompt payment and I thought as I had to pay a Miss Walker 260l on the 29th of March I might take the 105l as she wanted the money but I considered it merely a debtor and creditor s account having paid them at times more than I received - I should have repaid the money the next day or the day after had I not been taken up This 105l would not have been discovered but the moment I was aware of the charge being serious I sent for Mules and presented him with 126l to make up the deficiency telling him I was not aware of the serious crime I feel confident you will acquit me of any intention of defrauding them of a farthing they have kept all my papers memorandums and letters which I received from female friends and they have kept notes of hand and other property to six times this amount I cannot think they it is unless they wish to crush me entirely even my friends have been deterred from coming forward to this Court to speak to my character from the vindictive manner they have conducted this prosecution Instead of a prosecution it is a persecution if I had pleaded guilty Mr Boyd would have recommended me to mercy but a conviction they say they must have I believe if my life was in their hands they must take it but I have no doubt they have a motive perhaps they fear my getting into other houses and injuring their connexions there are other circumstances I could mention but I will not behave to them as they have to me I will not even allude to them there are prosecutions over their heads and they suppose I might be called as a witness and if I am convicted my evidence would be done away with I think that is one motive I hope you will take into your serious consideration how this prosecution has been got up how conducted and that they would not have been in possession of the circumstances had it not come from me at first in my over anxiety to do them justice GUILTY Aged 36 Transported for Fourteen Years 
t18280529-33  First London Jury - before Mr Recorder 1109 WILLIAM WATT was indicted for embezzlement MR ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution JOHN FORSYTH I am a draper and live at Birmingham I deal with Messrs Morrison and Co On the 3d of August last I bought some goods of them for which I paid the prisoner in their counting-house - I paid him a banker s bill for 200l and 35l 6s 5d in cash this is the bill I paid him looking at it here is the invoice - I saw the prisoner write this the discount is deducted - the actual sum I paid him was 232l 7s 6d I paid it to him as the servant of Morrison and Co Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q Had you ever seen him before A Not to my knowledge I have not seen him since till to-day I might pass him in the street without noticing him but I know him at the bar - I was not more than three minutes paying him the money he had his hat off - I have not the least doubt of him Q Do you mean to swear the person to whom you gave the paper did not take it to the desk for somebody else to write on it A No - I am certain I saw him write it himself when I paid him the money - he wrotethis memorandum on the bill with his own hand when I paid him the money I was close to him MR JOHN DILLON I am in partnership with James Morrison and Richard Pearson - we carry on business in Fore-street City as wholesale haberdashers mercers and warehousemen and have one hundred and fifty or one hundred and sixty persons in our employ - our returns are more than a million in a year The prisoner was in out employ up to the 3d of August and beyond that it was his duty to receive money for us which he was immediately to enter in the cash received book - that would be the only mode by which we could ascertain that he had received money - here is the cash received book of August last there is not entry of this sum received by the prisoner from Mr Forsyth on the 3d of August I have examined the book most carefully and repeatedly and it is not entered I have not carried my examination personally further than the 3d of August we balance our books daily - there is no such entry in any other book and he never accounted for the money that I have ascertained Q Have you another book called a ledger A We have the prisoner had no business whatever to write in the ledger I am bound to add he was at other times during a press of business allowed to enter in the ledger but not at this time and it was not his duty he was never allowed to do it except when specially appointed one side of the ledger is a copy from the cash received book - there are no original entries in it I find that in our ready money ledger Mr Forsyth is charged with goods 182l 2s 8d and 48l 3s 3d those charges are in the hand-writing of the original posting clerk and there is on the credit side an entry in the prisoner s writing 3d of August 210 which purports to be the number of a bill - 77 denoting the folio the entry is posted from the cash received book but there is no such entry in that book the next item is 2l 17s 11d interest then 228l importing that that sum had been posted from folio 77 of the cash received book the 228l odd added to 2l 17s 11d balances the sums of 182l 8s and 48l 3s 3d - the bill should have been marked 210 and given over to me but it was never done the account is closed in the ledger by this entry and we should never have thought of applying for the money - but the entry is altogether a deception it is a fictitious entry The account produced by Mr Forsyth is in the prisoner s hand-writing he left our service on the 2d of January this year we had not then discovered the transaction if we had known of Mr Forsyth having had these goods we should have applied for the money within a month he being a ready money customer The prisoner went from our employ to Mr Ellis of Ludgate-street we afterwards made a discovery but not of this transaction - I went to Mr Ellis with Mr Ashurst our solicitor on the 9th or 10th of March - I saw the prisoner there and said to him There are some entries in the books made by you which we cannot understand I wish you to go with us and explain them - his answers were confused I cannot give them except that he asked to go to get his hat in great agitation of manner - he said Let me go and get my hat we said we must go with him - he made a motion to go to the door at which we had entered but suddenly turned to a French glass door forced it open violently ran across some leads into another house belonging to Mr Ellis we followed him crying Stop Watt - Stop thief he escaped out of a back door I did not see him again till he was in custody about a month ago Q Look at the endorsement on this bill of exchange and tell me whose hand-writing it is A It is endorsed by Mr Forsyth and this receipt August 4 1827 received the contents William Watt is in the prisoner s writing the bill is for 200l on the Cardiff Bank at thirty-five days date payable at Messrs Glyn s bank London - here is a letter which came into my possession in consequence of my writing to Mr Symer a banker of Dundee - he is agent for the British Banking Company for Dundee - the letter is all in the prisoner s hand-writing the figures and all JOHN LUKEY I am a clerk to Messrs Glyn and Co This Cardiff Bank bill was brought to our house for payment - I paid it with a 200l Bank note No 9529 dated the 9th of July 1827 here is the book with the entry in my own hand-writing Letter read To Mr Symer Dundee - August 6th 106 Fore-street SIR - The enclosed also place to my credit with the British Linen Company - is it meant by your letter that no money deposited in your bank can be withdrawn by means of a cheque I am led to put this question from your request that I send a receipt endorsed when money is required I may not withdraw the whole at once it may be part if any respectable party were presenting a cheque for payment from me would it be dishonoured I regret giving you trouble by such inquiries but am compelled to do so from ignorance of the system adopted by your bank Oblige me by advising of the receipt as under Yours respectfully WM WATT N B I shall desire a gentleman to call and pay 2s 5d postage of the last remittance which I ommitted to pay 200l No 9529 - 20l No 1735 - Total 220l MR DILLON The figures and all this letter are his writing Cross-examined Q Nothing passed at Ellis about this transaction A No the ledger is posted by a young man named Wilkins we can refer to it at any time and cheque it by the cash book if we chose The prisoner very seldom made an entry in the ledger I cannot find the hand-writing of any other clerk in it except the one who kept it - we only keep one cash received book but have several ledgers Boon and Slater are in our employ it is not the business of either of them to make entries in the ledger - I am certain Boon never did - it is barely possible that Slater might the number 210 is merely to distinguish that it was a bill and not cash the whole sum is entered as 228l not 232l I can explain that - Mr Forsyth made a separate purchase which came to 4l 8s 6d and that is the next entry The prisoner received money and Slater also The prisoner was never employed as an entering clerk Q Suppose these entries were made by one person the clerk who came next would see them A Why the clerk who enters in the book has a great deal to do and would attend to nothing but what he was about he certainly ought to have been sharp enough to discover the entry MR ADOLPHUS Q Is it your practice to look into that ledger often A No we look into the cash received book - if we find the money posted in the ledger we conclude all is right MR BRODRICK Q Can you say positively from your recollection that this bill was not paid to you A Not from my recollection but from the course of our business I say decidedly not - we have no entry of it except this fictitious one in the ledger if it had been in the cashbook it would have been regular - the person posting the ledger has the cash-book at his side it is not called over by one and entered by another MR ADOLPHUS Q If that payment had been entered in the book should you not have discovered it A Yes if it had been entered there and not brought to account I should have discovered it that day the cash would have been wrong this entry could not be made by mistake for he has put the folio from which it purports to be brought and no such entry is in that folio I am positive this 200l bill has never passed through our hands it has none of our marks on it whatever DANIEL FORRESTER I am a City officer I made search in London for the prisoner and in consequence of information I went to Edinburgh on the 26th of April and found him there at ten o clock on Sunday night the 27th I was waiting the arrival of a smack and took him near St Andrew s-square he then had on a pair of mustachios I went in front of him and seized him by the throat we had a struggle and both fell - some person came up to my assistance and secured him He answered to the name of Watt and gave me up everything he had about him - I found this paper on him MR DILLON This is in the prisoner s hand-writing - read To Mrs Williams Post Office - to be called for MY DEAR CAROLINE - Be careful at Stall s 121 Rose-street To prevent watching go into several houses and ask after furnished lodgings and you will see if any one is coming after you - I am your affectionate husband WILLIAMS Prisoner I do not conceive it necessary to say any thing to the charge it may go to the Jury as it is GUILTY Aged 21 Transported for Fourteen Years

t18280911-20  Second London Jury - Before Mr Common Sergeant 1577 HENRY EVANS was indicted for embezzlement RICHARD LILLWALL I am in partnership with Robert Moline and was so in August 1827 the prisoner came into our service as clerk about August 1826 - I cannot exactly recollect the time it was the middle of the year or rather earlier - he had 40l a-year his mother who I knew to be a respectable woman wished him to sleep at home but be boarded in the house - Nathan Smith is our chief clerk and cashier - it is his business to make up the daily account of cash received - if the partners receive money they hand it over to him the prisoner was authorized to receive money if he was at home and was to pay it over to Smith - if he received a cheque he should enter it and hand it over to Smith In August 1827 Hoffman and Co were brokers of a ship in which we were interested and were indebted to us 64l 1s 11d on account of one ship and 166l 3s 1d on account of another - the 64l 1s 11d has been brought to account but the other amount has never been entered in the cash-book and has never come to our hands GEORGE SCHENK I am clerk to Hoffman and Co ship-brokers These accounts looking at them were sent from our house to the prosecutors I called on them on the 22d of August 1827 with some money - Evans came forward to me in the counting-house and I gave him two cheques which I have here for the balance of the two accounts The cheques being produced were on Messrs Glynns dated the 22d of August for 166l 3s 1d and 64l 1s 11d signed Hoffman and Co NATHAN SMITH I am chief clerk to the prosecutors The prisoner was in their service and entrusted to receive money when payments were made to him - this cheque for 64l odd came into my hands on the 22d of August and I have no doubt from the prisoner - Barnett and Co is written across the face of it in my writing and here is my hand-writing on the back it is an account of the exact balance of the cash of that day - if a cheque for 166l had been paid in it would appear here - it does not appear here nor in the book - it never came to my hands Prisoner It was customary on Thursdays and Fridays on busy days for money to be placed on a desk for you to enter Witness I do not know of any particular days but cheques have at times been placed on my desk - if a cheque had been paid in I have no doubt but it would be accounted for OWEN THOMAS WILLIAMS I am a clerk to Messrs Glynn& Co On Saturday the 25th of August this cheque was presented at our house and paid by me - I cannot say to whom I paid one note of 100l No 13 181 dated 30th of July 1827 one 50l No 7 837 dated 1st of August 1827 and 15l 3s 1d in cash CHARLES HUGGINS I am a clerk in the Bank of England On Saturday the 25th of August 1827 these two notes were presented at the Bank - I gave one hundred and fifty sovereigns for them here is my writing on the back I cannot say who the person was - they were presented in the name of Mclntosh as the person receiving them WILLIAM BARNES I am a clerk to the prosecutors and know the prisoner s hand-writing very well I fully believe the name of Mclntosh at the back of these notes to be his writing NATHAN SMITH re-examined The prisoner left the prosecutor s service on the 24th or 25th of the eighth month 1827 - two days after this payment was made he had a very sudden discharge I believe MR LILLWALL The prisoner was dismissed almost immediately after this circumstance we discovered this about a month after and employed an officer but could not find him till now Prisoner s Defence This prosecution has come most unexpectedly upon me - those who have preferred it might have made it a subject of enquiry last Session on my return from America I requested a friend to call on them and express my contrition for my imprudence - they received him in the kindest manner spoke in the highest terms of my services and said if I had not gone astray they intended to place me beyond the situation of a clerk this friend found no difficulty in bringing them to a compromise - they told him they thought me entitled to reversionary property and would take that if it could be made over and would take the amount in easy instalments if my relatives would give security for it my friend left it to their solicitor to draw up the document to be signed by my mother and myself for 20l a-year to liquidate the debt satisfied with this and relying on their word which I would have taken as a most solemn oath of any person I began business on my own account hoping by diligent attendance I should regain the character to which before I had been always entitled to as well as prevent my mother being called on for payment of the 20l yearly I was suffered to carry on business a very short time - it was daily on the increase when through the treachery of some concealed foe the party who had lent me a small sum to begin with demanded it and arrested me and threw me into prison this did not prevent my exertions - I got out of prison and expected the refusal of two situations which would enable me to liquidate the prosecutor s demand and notwithstanding their solemn affirmation on the 16th I was taken on a charge for felony convinced of the evil of my follies I had determined to become a steady man let meleave my fate in your hands fully confident you will not attribute the prosecution to love of justice but to some other motive and under these circumstances will restore me to society if you think there is not enough to produce an acquittal you will consider the Act now in force admitting the affirmation of Quakers was not in existence at the time the offence was committed and I submit my case is not within it MR LILWALL I was called on by a friend of his about four months ago - I said I regretted the circumstance very much on account of the high opinion entertained of him and his talents and we had a view of making him a traveller - I gave him no encouragement to set up in business nor did I know he was in business - his friend did not say where he was to be found the officer has been in search of him ever since Mr Cochrane came and proposed it should bepaid by instalments - I immediately referred him to my solicitor - COCHRANE I called on the prosecutors on the prisoner s behalf - he declined entering into any arrangement in consequence of the absence of his partner and made an appointment on the 14th of June which I attended - Evans proposition was if they would allow him to become a useful member of society he would endeavour to pay him 20l a-year and would make over some property which he had in reversion and would submit to any privation if they would allow him to reinstate himself in some employ - I believe I stated that he was in England but not where they stated distinctly whatever arrangement might be entered into should be without prejudice to any proceedings they might adopt but if he gave security they had respected him and did not wish to hurt him GUILTY Aged 21 Transported for Fourteen Years 
t18280911-63  1620 JOHN alias ROBERT SPEAKMAN was indicted for embezzlement MR ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution HENRY BRICHENO I am a brewer and live in Skinner-street Bishopsgate and have a place of business also in Seven-dials The prisoner had been in my employ from February till July he came to me in an humble situation but I advanced him to be my drayman in April - it was his duty to deliver goods and receive money for them and account for what he receives to Mr Greathead my clerk when he received it and nobody else - I myself knew nothing about the accounts he was always desired to settle with Greathead Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How many steps did he take in your service in that short time in consequence of his good conduct A Three he conducted himself well WILLIAM GREATHEAD I am clerk to Mr Bricheno at the Skinner-street place where the prisoner was employed - he ought to account to me there for the money he receives every day in the evening he had a book of cheques by which he kept his account - he calls the account over from the counterpart of his cheques and I enter it into a book and then call it over again to see if it is correct - I then ask him how much cash he has he gives me an account of his gold silver and copper and if anything is short he puts so much short the counterpart of the cheque is written by him Neale of Philip-lane sells our intermediate beer I have an entry to him on the 1st of May of half a barrel 12s 6d and 12s 6d paid - I took that entry from the prisoner s month and from his receipts here is the counterpart of the receipt in his writing - it corresponds with my entry and at the end of that day I have his own writing for the money he paid in which agrees with the account he gave 12s 6d is the only sum he accounted for as received from Neale On the 13th of June Springsguth came and particularly wanted some beer to be sent he ordered one half-barrel or eighteen gallons - I could not send it till one of the men came home - he came again about eight o clock and soon after I sent by the prisoner one half-barrel for him and another for Mr Wilkinson of Tenter-row he returned at half-past ten saying he had brought one back as Wilkinson s was shut up and had put it into the ton room - he paid me 12s 6d for Springsguth s half-barrel there are so many casks in the ton room we could not discover whether the other had been put there or not - he never gave me an account of having sold Springsguth two half-barrels Cross-examined Q Is it your business to pay over to the prosecutor the sums as you receive them A No in a lump - I pay them next morning keeping each drayman s cash in a separate bag the prisoner never ran an account with me - he said on the 24th of July that he had been knocked down and robbed of his books that was after this transaction - he did not send for me to his lodgings I went there to take him into custody - that was about three days after he said he had been knocked down he had not come to business after the 24th I did not find him at his lodgings but in the street five days before he was taken a message was sent that he had been knocked down and lost his book that was the very last day he went out with the dray - when I saw him he seemed as if he had been fighting he said he had lost the books not that he was robbed of them - he is married and has a family MR ADOLPHUS Q If he had laid out any money for necessaries would that be charged to him immediately and deducted A Yes - that was settled every Saturday night I produce the original book he accounted to me every night for what he received SAMUEL NEALE I deal in intermediate beer and have it from the prosecutor I will not swear that any beer was delivered to me on the 1st of May - I will not swear to the date but the receipt is dated the 1st of May - I have it here Q Who gave you that receipt A That I cannot swear the name is not written plain Q Did you receive any beer into your house in May A That I will not swear - I am not always at home I cannot make out the name on the receipt I will not swear what beer I had for I at times had eighteen gallons and at times thirty-six - I always paid for it regularly Q Did you if you were out always find a corresponding receipt for the beer which came in A Yes WILLIAM GREATHEAD This receipt is in the prisoner s hand-writing Cross-examined Q Have you often seen him write A Yes I know it to be his writing without comparing it with any other The receipt being read was dated the 1st of May for half a barrel of intermediate beer 18s 9d signed J Speakman WILLIAM GREATHEAD That receipt belongs to the prisoner s book and is the counterpart to the one he has written in - it corresponds in number and every particular except the sum he has entered it Nill instead of Neale here - the sum entered in the book is 12s 6d SAMUEL NEALE re-examined Q How long have you had been from the prosecutor A Since the 1st of March- the prisoner may have brought it a dozen times or more I have sometimes paid him but when I was out my mistress paid I never paid him without a receipt I have no recollection of this transaction not of the day not to swear to this man coming JAMES SPRINGSGUTH I live in Old-street and deal in intermediate beer On the 13th of June I had two kilderkins from the prosecutor I never before nor since had two in one day - here is the receipt for them I sent to the prosecutor that day and the prisoner brought two kilderkins on a sledge he was to take one to another person - he asked if I objected to take two I took them and my brother paid him for them in my presence he filled the receipt up - here is the receipt it is for two kilderkins - here is my hand-writing on it Cross-examined Q When did you write your name on the receipt A When Mr Greathead called to see my receipt he took this away with another or two and gave me an acknowledgement for them I swear the prisoner wrote the receipts which he gave me The receipt being read was for 25s 8d WILLIAM GREATHEAD This receipt is in the prisoner s hand-writing I have not got the counterpart of it Cross-examined Q Look at both these receipts - do you say that both these names are in the prisoner s handwriting A I am positive the same person wrote both he did not pay me more than 12s 6d - it is impossible I can be mistaken Prisoner s Defence written I most solemnly assert my innocence of the charge altogether As regards the money which Mr Springsguth s brother says he paid me I can call to mind that on the 13th of June last late in the evening it might be about nine o clock I was sent out with beer to several customers and among the number Mr Springsguth was one and ordered one cask after going to the customers to whom I had been on my return homewards I called upon Mr Springsguth having two casks left always alive to the interest of my employer I prevailed upon Mr Springsguth to take both the casks for which it appears by the receipt he paid me My Lord and Gentlemen I observed before that as Mr Springsguth ordered but one cask - the counterpart of the receipt might have been marked for one cask while I delivered the money for two casks thus the error might easily arise he it as it may I am confident the money was accounted for Mr Greathead if he speaks impartially cannot deny that errors have crept in in the manner I have just now described- I am conscious of having given Mr Springsguth s money to Mr Greathead it being late he put the money into his right-hand waistcoat pocket and did not enter it in the book - next morning he might have forgotten it GUILTY Aged 26 The prosecutor stated that he had forty charges against the prisoner Transported for Fourteen Years

I entrusted him to receive money on my account and to pay it Mrs Thacker owed me 13l 7s 10d - I never sent him for that money it had been due to me about two months she lived in Hertfordshire I never inquired of the prisoner respecting it I wrote to Mrs Thacker for the amount - the prisoner had left my employ about a fortnight before that he never said any thing to me about this money - I settled all accounts with him at the time he left me Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You of course paid him all you owed him and there was a balance struck A He owes me something now he left a cage and two birds at my counting-house and wished me to buy them for 12s but I refused I had a dispute with him and discharged him but he said he was in distress and should feel obliged if I would give him a few days employ and I sent him on messages I cannot swear how long I kept him at the time he brought the cage a captain was there who had paid him money which he had not handed to me and I told him to leave the counting-house and never come again I do not think he remained with me a single day after that - a gentleman once gave him an old sofa for his attention to him at the docks I cannot now recollect whether that ever came into my possession so many things pass in the course of a twelvemonth - if I did I gave it to one of the men at the docks - but it is a trifling circumstance and I cannot say whether I had it or not I only say if it was given to the prisoner it was given away again to some of the men and I must have given him a compensation for it I have had many such things in my possession I do recollect something about one but what it was I do not know it was not worth 5s - it was an Indian couch they are sold at 10s new I remember one was given to him but whether I ever had it I cannot say I did not authorise him to receive money generally but I have sent him for money and if any was brought to the counting-house he received it I cannot say whether I told the Magistrate he was not authorised he did receive small sums such as 1l or 2l I know Captain Liddel he was not on board the Wellington I have a hundred small accounts and cannot recollect them all I have no recollection of desiring him to borrow money on my account for dock charges - but it is common with us if we want to ship goods in a hurry to borrow money till the morning to pay the dock charges COURT Q Did the prisoner ever demand any thing as due by you to him A Never I made this charge about a week or a fortnight after he left MARY ANN WEBBER I live at No 48 Chiswell-street Finsbury I carried a letter containing money to the prisoner the letter appeared to me to contain money - I felt money in it I staid while it was opened it was from Mrs Thacker directed to Mr Taylor - I took it to the East India Chambers Leadenhall-street which was Mr Taylor s counting-house I delivered the letter to the prisoner and was in the counting-house when it was opened I did not positively see him open it- I said I had brought that letter for Mr Taylor and I was to take a receipt back for it he said Mr Taylor was not there but my paying it to him would be quite right the same as if I paid it to Mr Taylor - he gave me a stamped receipt I brought it home and gave it to the lady who gave me the letter - she was in town then it was Mrs Thacker s mother I never read it myself I did not know what the sum was - I am sure I gave Mrs Thacker s mother the same paper I received from the prisoner Cross-examined Q He might have passed off as Mr Taylor to you if he had chosen A yes I felt something like money in the letter and heard it jink -

I was aware what sums hehad taken we have a fair cash-book but I understood the notice I had was to produce this book it being the one he made the entry in - he does not make entries in the other cash-book it is a copy of this rough book and is made up once a month - the notice mentions a book containing entries made by him as such I have brought this one I ascertained on Thursday that he had taken 20l and not accounted for it - I went through the rough book that evening and went to several customers to ask what sums had been paid and on looking at the cash-book I found several sums inserted and endeavoured to be covered by a payment to Cowley which was never made and next day I got him to the books I saw him enter this sum the night he was arrested and he copied the other cash-book up from the rough one - I saw him enter it in both because the other book was not made up I insisted on his making it up as the books were much behind COURT Q Was it his duty to enter it first in the rough cash-book A Yes and to pay the money over to the cash-keeper and get his acknowledgement for it immediately THOMAS WATTS I deal with Mr Nunn and owed him 46l which I paid to the prisoner on the 13th of June and took this memorandum from him I saw him write it- read By bill and cash 46l R C Norris Mr Nunn applied to me about this in December - I gave the prisoner a 30l bill due on the 29th of July which unfortunately was not paid he brought it back to me himself the day after it was due and I gave him the money - I gave him part of the 16l in cash Cross-examined Q He signed his name to your account which could be produced at any time A Exactly so I live within thirty yards of Mr Nunn MR NUNN The prisoner never brought me that bill JOHN DAVIS I am cash-keeper to Mr Nunn The prisoner has been in his service between three and four years and should pay to me the money he received on the same day - I never received from him any part of this sum he should receive my signature for the payment in this book WILLIAM BRAND I took the prisoner into custody - I asked how he accounted for the absence of the money he said he had parted with it by lending it to people and treating people Prisoner s Defence Had that cash-book been produced I should have satisfied your Lordship the amount I am accused of entering on the Saturday night was posted as the marginal folio in the book will prove - I have never concealed nor disguised any thing he asked me in a friendly manner to tea the day he took me and treated me like a brother - I entered the sum about the time I ought to have entered it the cash-book would clearly prove it MR PHILLIPS to MR NUNN Q Is this a copy of the notice served on you A I believe it is - I conceived this to be the book required but I will send for the cashbook JOHN DAVIS The entry in the cash-book would be made by the prisoner from the rough book The witness fetched the fair cash-book and then continued his evidence Here is the cash-book MR PHILLIPS Q Is there a ledger A Yes that is at the counting-house there are entries here to Watts I have never seen the ledger myself - I have nothing to do with it here is Folio 119 I do not know what that means - I never refer to the ledger except to ascertain if a person should be trusted further MR NUNN I said I saw this entry made on Saturday night and tell you candidly from seeing this that I have said wrong - it was another entry a little further on which you will see I have said nothing intentionally wrong I saw him make a quantity of entries and conceived this was one but there were a great many sums he had appropriated to his own purpose - I am not now perfectly satisfied that I am wrong but I see this folio there by which I presume it was posted prior to that I cannot tell whether I am right or wrong for there are five or six entries without a folio some before and some after that and those entries were put down on that night COURT Q Has the money been paid to you A It never has GUILTY Aged 35 -

he resembled the person very much but he was not in the same dress I think I can swear he is the person - there were other persons in the shop - it is a place of a good deal of business WILLIAM BOYER I live in White-street Poplar and am a brass-founder On the 15th of September I bought some colours at the prosecutor s and paid 13s 4d to the prisoner - I have his receipt for it in his writing Cross-examined Q Do you remember the person -A Yes perfectly well there were other persons there GEORGE WHITEFHEAD I am a journeyman baker I paid 9s 2d to the prisoner on the 16th of September for some articles - here is the bill and receipt THOMAS HUBBOCK JUN I am in partnership with my father - his name is Thomas we are oil and colourmen The prisoner was in our employ from the middle of June he was to keep a book and make entries of every thing he served out - he was to enter it as he served it and bring the in an account every night and hand over the bulk of the money and he had a small balance down to give change in the morning On the 25th of August here is no entry of the name of Brown 8s nor of the other two amounts - he was not to account to any body but me these receipts are his writing THOMAS HUBBOCK SEN The prisoner never paid me any of these sums Cross-examined Q How many persons have you in your employ A Six besides the prisoner but the others do not sell goods - they only make them up and get them ready under his orders our business is more particularly retail - we have a counter the till is formed of the prisoner s desk - he puts the money into it no one sells goods but the prisoner while he is there - when he is not one of the men do and give him an account some trifling entries may possibly have been omitted but that is provided for by his putting down sundries if he has more money than is accounted for - on the day after the 25th of August he appears by the book to have received 12s 1d I am not aware he has ever forgotten something on one day and put it down the next - I should have told him to put the date against it if he had mentioned it to me people often buy things and pay for them without a receipt - it depends partly on him and partly on the persons who come whether he gives a receipt or not - he has a family and his wife has lately been confined GUILTY Aged 27 2022 THOMAS GOWLING was again indicted for embezzlement DANIEL WILTON I am a plumber painter and glazier I bought 10lbs of green paint and two gallons of oil of the prisoner on the 13th of September and paid him 18s 11d on the 18th of September I bought some white lead and paid 13s for it Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Did you have any bills A Yes but we could not find them I took them to my father and they were put on the table but we took no notice of them -

t18301028-19  Before Mr Baron Garrow 1859 JOHN HANSON was indicted for embezzlement JOHN BROWN I am a coal-merchant and live at Brentford the prisoner was in my service in August last Sarah Jacobs and Ann Quinley are customers of mine - the prisoner was authorized to receive money for coals and should account to me every evening for what he carried out in the course of the day whether it was paid for or to be booked - he was sent out with some coals on the 8th of July when he came home in the evening he booked one sack of coals to Mrs Jacobs saying she had not enough to pay him but had given him 3s on account I am quite sure I never received the rest from him which was 5s if I had it would have been entered On the 23rd of August he booked 12s to Mrs Jacobs saying she had three sacks of coals and had not money to pay for them he never paid me for them - he stated that he had delivered to Mrs Kelly two sacks which came to 8s on credit he never paid me that money Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Were you in the habit of seeing Mrs Jacobs A I had not seen her when he paid the 3s I have known him sometimes give receipts but not always I had no quarrel with him more han charging him with being lazy - I took him to the office about furious driving but not about breaking my horse s knee the charge was dismissed SARAH JACOBS In July last I bought three sacks of coals of the prosecutor which came to 12s - I paid the prisoner the whole 12s I bought more in August and paid him 12s for them all at once Cross-examined Q Are you not in the habit of taking receipts A I did for the first transaction but as my neighbour saw me pay the second I depended on that - the first dealing I had with the prisoner he came and asked if I wanted coals I had no money - he called on Mond and I gave him 5s 3d on account and took a receipt for that I am sure I paid him the whole amount for the two parcels in question my neighbour stood by while I paid him ANN QUINLEY I had some coals from the prisoner I do not know the date - I always pay for the first two sacks before I have any more I paid part every week and am quite certain I paid the prisoner the whole amount Cross-examined Q Can you tell in what sums you paid him A Sometimes 1s 1s 6d or 2s - he charges me in the book for 8s I only owed 2s I took a receipt for the last payment - here it is it says Received on or about 6s left 2s - it has no date or name Prisoner s Defence She never paid me GUILTY Aged 19 - Transported for Seven Years

t18301209-19  20 JOSEPH KEMP was indicted for embezzlement MR CARRINGTON conducted the prosecution ROBERT NICOLL I am an attorney and solicitor and live in Queen-street Cheapside The prisoner was in my service as copying clerk - he had 30s a week he had been in my service alone for about three years and was formerly with myself and my late partner Mr Steel who died in February 1827 he kept my petty cash and always charged his salary in his disbursements - there was nothing due to him when he said he wanted money I asked him how much - he would say 10l or 15l and I gave him a cheque for it Looking at a cheque upon the Bank of England for 10l signed Robert Nicoll dated the 3rd of July 1828 this is my cheque and has been charged to my account at the Bank Joseph Kemp is written on the back of it in the prisoner s hand-writing- here is another cheque dated the 17th of October 1828 for 15l - I gave that to the prisoner on the 17th of October his name is endorsed on it and it is payable to him - the Bank have charged me with it here is another for 10l dated the 15th of December payable to him - I gave him that and his name is on the back in his own handwriting the whole of this book producing it is in the prisoner s hand-writing - it is the book in which he entered the small payments he made for me he added them up every week including his salary and on Saturdays he went to the other end of the book where there is a cash account on one side he debited to me for the payments and it was his duty on the other side to give me credit for these cheques On the 3rd of July 1828 there is no entry on the credit side - on the 17th of October there is 5l entered- it has been 15l the figure I is evidently scratched out and the adding up at the bottom only reckons it as 5l on the 15th of December 1828 there is no entry at all - the sum cast up is correct according to the entry Q By comparing the other cheques with the entries do you find they are not entered to any other date A They are not accounted for in any place whatever - on the 23rd of October this year I determined to charge the prisoner with this offence I had discovered it only a day or two before - I did not hold out either threat or promise to him I took the book which he kept in my hand and asked if he was aware of the omissions he had made in the sums in my account he said No I may have omitted by mistake to give credit for a sum I said Did you by mistake alsoscratch out the figures in this account which I pointed out - he said No I said I have carefully examined your accounts and find a deficiency to the amount of 300l - what have you done with the money he said I must have spent it I said Have you not got it he said No but if you will not prosecute I will insure my life for it I said insuring his life was nothing to me for he knew it could not be done under the full value - I asked if he had any cause for the conduct he had pursued- he said No that I had always treated him in the most gentlemanly manner that is what passed as near as possible but I was very unwell at the time - I said all I wanted was my money if he had not spent it Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q He did not say whether he had spent it in your concerns or his own A I asked how he had spent it - he said he supposed it must be in supporting his father and mother I did not recollect that before and there may be many other things I do not think of - he has been in my employ since the 25th of March 1824 Q Your sons I understand are grown up and able to fill his situation A No I have no sons - I have nephews he was only a copying clerk - I trusted him with my money but not to do business for my clients I made an entry in my book every time I paid him money - he kept his own accounts I checked the disbursements every week the running account should have been settled at the end of each year but I did not settle it nor appoint any body to do it - he added them up at the end of the year I can tell they are not right by comparing my own book with his which I have done - I have compared a great many items in his presence he balanced the accounts every year but unfortunately I did not examine them with his - I have since examined his book I produced the books to him in my office and asked if he could explain them - he said No Mr Ainger was present - he represents himself to be a single man and I believe he is so his book stood open in the room he sat in - it was open to every body I believed him honest and must take blame to myself for not checking his book with him every year - I might have done it every week for what he knew I contented myself with examining the disbursements - an omission may have taken place without culpability his name is on the back of every cheque which intimates that he has received the money - it is the custom of the Bank of England to require it one of the cheques is dated the 15th of December - I am obliged to select any three that happen to come together I have three others in this year - the cheques do not return to me except when I have my book made up I might not have it made up till a good deal of 1829 had passed but I cannot say when it was made up - I did not balance his book at the end of 1828 Q Would not your pass-book shew whether the cheque had been received A No the Bank do not enter their cheques with dates and numbers but merely the name of the page and the sum I had given the prisoner notice when I discovered this but he had not left - I did not mean to keep him more than a month but kept him all the long vacation that he might not leave without getting a place he did very little in the long vacation - I produced the cheques before the Magistrate to show there could be no mistake I drew one cheque on the 2nd of July and another on the 3rd - he has credited me for the one on the 2nd but not on the 3rd I think a person looking carelessly at the book would not notice the erasure every body in the office could have access to the book COURT Q Could it have been the least possible advantage to a stranger to scratch out that figure A Not the least besides it is added up as only five in his figures at the bottom A JUROR Q Part of these sums are ticked off in the book but not all can you explain that A That has been done since the prisoner was apprehended the sums paid him by cheques are checked off for me to look out the cheques - the sum erased is not ticked that being charged SAMUEL DENNIS I am a clerk in the drawing-office at the Bank This cheque dated the 3rd of July has been through my hands when a cheque is brought to the Bank it is customary to ask the person to write his name on the back - I recollect the prisoner coming several times but not presenting any particular cheque when a person writes his name on it I give him an order on the tellers if he wants cash - I did so for this cheque this is the order looking at it if he had wanted notes I should have paid them myself - FISH I paid this order - it is entered in my book as paid on the 3rd of July Cross-examined Q Do you recollect whether you paid it or not A I have no distinct recollection of it but the entry is a sufficient proof to me I paid it in cash MR PHILLIPS to S DENNIS Q Was there any suspicion about the transaction A Certainly not or I should have inquired about it the pass-books are made up when required by the parties - the prosecutor s book I find was made up on the 5th of March 1829 we return the cheques with the book - Mr Nicoll could have had it made up at any time - NORRIS I am a clerk in the drawing-office -This cheque dated the 17th of October was presented to me I gave an order on the tellers for it CHARLES CHEVELEY I was a teller at the Bank on the 17th of October 1828 but am not so now I have the order made out for this cheque - I paid it in cash it is for 15l - we never pay notes WILLIAM POPHAM GATTY I have come from the drawing-office This cheque dated the 15th of December was presented to me I gave an order on the tellers for it- here is the order - EDWARDS I am a teller I paid this order for 10l in gold ALFRED AINGER I am an architect and live in Doughty-street - I am related to Mr Nicoll On the 23rd of October last I was at his office the prisoner was there- neither of us held out either threat or promise to him I walked into the office with Mr Nicoll with the book of disbursements and receipts and stated to Mr Kemp that he had been looking over all the accounts for some time and was very much shocked to find there were omissions in the sums he had received and additions to the sums disbursed - he said he thought there must be some mistake- Mr Nicoll said Then we will go into particulars he began at the first error or alteration he had discovered Kemp at first said he could not tell how it happened but at last as they began to multiply his recollection was worse and on coming to the alteration of the 15l he became much more agitated and was evidently unable to answer how it was to be accounted for Mr Nicoll pressed him to answer - I said I thought it not worth while to worry him any more as he did not deny it and he said I cannot deny it he asked Mr Nicoll what was the total amount of alterations and things of that sort he had discovered - Mr Nicoll said nearly or upwards of 300l I asked what had become of the money - he said he could not account for it he supposed some of it had been spent on his mother I think he only named his mother Mr Nicoll asked if he had any thing left - he said he had not that what he had in his pocket was all he had in the world he offered to reinstate it if Mr Nicoll would not prosecute - not having friends to advance the money he would insure his life Mr Nicoll replied that was worth nothing and was no security the rest of the conversation was merely his entreating Mr Nicoll to forego the prosecution - he afterwards came to me in the room and requested me to intercede with Mr Nicoll not to prosecute Cross-examined Q What did you mean by requesting Mr Nicoll not to worry him A It was evidently very unpleasant to him calling over one amount after another Mr Nicoll on the day he first discovered this deficiency requested me to accompany him to the office next morning - he did not tell me to take notice of what the prisoner said we are in the habit of talking confidentially about our pursuits - whether the prisoner said I admit it or I cannot deny it or it is of no use to deny it I cannot say I went to notice the whole proceedings - nothing was said about my being a witness - Mr Nicoll had not determined on prosecuting I knew if he did prosecute I should be a witness - Mr Nicoll s cash-book was on the table it was the discrepancy between that and the prisoner s book that he called his attention to - the prisoner was given into custody within half an hour there was no other book required to be produced - I had known for six months that Mr Nicoll had determined to part with the prisoner Q From 1828 down to November 1830 if he had been conscious of any fraud was there any thing to prevent his absconding from the charge A Nothing MR CARRINGTON Q Did the prisoner apply for the production of any other book whatever A Not at all it appeared to me that all the books connected with the subject were produced GUILTY Aged 35 Recommended to Mercy on account of the Prosecutor s neglect in not examining his accounts Transported for Fourteen Years

t18331017-127  First London Jury before Mr Recorder 1533 RICHARD DREW was indicted for embezzlement MR PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution LOUIS NORTON I am a solicitor among other Courts I practise in the Insolvent Court - the prisoner was my clerk and as such was authorised to receive money from my clients - I had one named Fuller and another named Wood I received information on the 17th of September that he had received money from Fuller - I had seen him on the previous night in Whitecross-street prison - there was a client of mine named Wood there to whom I paid a visit - I had seen Wood alone first and hearing the prisoner was in the prison I sent for him into the presence of Wood I said Mr Drew I understand you have received £2 from Wood he said Yes I have he said so in Wood s presence I said Where is it he said I have got it I asked him to hand it over he then said he had not got it but would get it in a quarter of an hour I asked him where Mr Wood s papers were he said Round at your office - I then said Unless you immediately give me the papers and also the money I have a good mind to prosecute you upon which he went away - I called at his lodging the following evening and said Where are Wood s papers they are not at my office he said There they are Sir throwing them down on the bed - I told him I had that instant ascertained that he had received 17s 6d from Fuller he said I know I have I asked where it was he said he had spent it I threatened to prosecute him he told me I might do as I liked on which I went down stairs called a patrol and gave him in charge - there is an indictment pending against myself and others for a conspiracy - the prisoner knew that I paid him 25s a week - I settled with him every Saturday night - I made him write a receipt in my book for his wages every Saturday night - the receipts are regular in the book for his weekly wages - he had never accounted to me for this money until he tendered it before the magistrate at his second examination - he threw in a paper account he made no such statement at the first examination Cross-examined by MR ARNOLD Q Had he been out of your service before you made the charge A He was in my employ up to the Tuesday night when I discovered he had received Wood s money - I had not dismissed him from my service before - I did not ask the prisoner to come into my service - he had met me in the street some months previous and asked me if I could give him a situation I said I was full and had no place for him and while I laid ill one of my clerks engaged him - I did not know that he was in the service of Abrahams another attorney - he came to me he did not tell me that he was in Abrahams service and must give him a week s notice before he could leave - he called on me on a Saturday evening and wanted to know what salary I would give him and I told him - I took him without a character Q I believe in the course of his employment you have trusted him with considerable sums of money A To the amount of about 20l at a time - I always found him act faithfully - I should not think I have trusted him with 30l or 40l - I have sent him out to get cheques cashed he has gone to my tradesmen I believe and got the amount for cheques I cannot say that I was in the habit of giving him cheques - he may have had 35l at a time - Fuller had not complained to me of neglecting his business for unfortunately almost immediately after I became employed for him I was confined to the house very muchthrough an accident - I should say his business was got through in the Insolvent Court with the usual quickness he never complained to me for I think I saw him but twice I never received such a message from him by one of my clerks - I never knew he was dissatisfied - I was to pay the prisoner 1l 5s a week he attended from nine o clock in the morning until eight o clock in the evening in the vacation and from nine to nine in term out of which he was allowed two hours for dinner he did not work beyond those hours in the office certainly never for me to my knowledge I have never paid him for any extra work he has done I never paid him two shillings for two extra hours not for engrossing a schedule of James Cooper to my recollection I will positively swear I never did nor ever for any extra work COURT Q Did you allow him to retain for his own use sums received from clients A I believe he said he kept back two shillings one week for sums he said he had paid to the crier of the prison Re-examined I did not say when he entered my service My hours are so and so - I never require my clerk to attend beyond that hour or if I do I pay him for it Q Did you ever promise the prisoner to give him something extra in consequence of his staying one hour at dinner instead of two A I swear most positively he took on several occasions three hours instead of two and came back drunk and I threatened to discharge him I never promised to make it up to him for staying only one hour - I did not promise him five shillings for every case he brought to my office nothing of the kind nor did he ever get a case while he was with me - I owe him two days wages now which is the Monday and Tuesday - I have subpoened Fuller here he has come up from Harwich - I have not given him an undertaking to pay him something for coming up to give evidence he was not up here to find the bill and I wrote to him that his recognizance would be estreated WILLIAM WOOD I am a prisoner confined for debt I am brought here by habeas - I employed Mr Norton as my solicitor to procure my release - I saw the prisoner I paid him 2l at separate times the first pound was about the 16th of July and the next about a week after - on the evening of the 10th of September I remember Norton paying me a visit in consequence of a message I sent to him and he sent for Drew and asked him in my presence if he had received any money from me Drew said he had received 2l Norton asked if he had got the money he said to the best of my recollection he had not got it but could get it in a quarter of an hour Norton told him he had a very good mind to prosecute him for embezzlement and Drew then left him to get the money Cross-examined Q You employed Mr Norton as your attorney A I did I saw him about twice - I generally saw the prisoner - I gave him the 2l for the expense of getting through the court I did not take any acknowledgment from him - it was not for the express purpose of employing counsel I did not tell him to go himself and get counsel for me I told him I expected Mr Norton would do my business and find counsel - I had an agreement with Mr Norton to do my business for a certain sum I said I expected Mr Norton to find counsel for that amount - Drew gave me an undertaking it was given me by Drew about the time I paid him the money this is it producing it I received this from him in consequence of paying him the 2l I took the undertaking thinking he was doing it for Mr Norton I never told him not to pay the money over to Mr Norton I never said such a word - I certainly complained of Mr Norton s neglecting my business because I could get nothing done - I was delayed and kept there Q Now did you not tell the prisoner not to give the money to Norton for he had neglected you and you would not employ him any longer A No I did not the money was paid when I first had the dealing - when I told Drew to bring the books and I would have nothing more to do with Mr Norton was five or six weeks after I had paid the money I did not complain of him at the time I paid the money - counsel was to be employed in case there was opposition - it was to be done for the amount I agreed with Mr Norton for - it was part of the original agreement with Norton to supply me with counsel for the whole sum I was to pay him it was not to be a specific charge afterwards MR PHILLIPS Q Was £5 the sum you were to pay Norton A That was the agreement I understood from Mr Norton that he had declined coming to see me because he understood I had not advanced any money and I sent him word that I had given his clerk £2 the prisoner did not deny it - after Mr Norton found the money had been kept back by the prisoner he acted for me and did my business as well as he could MR ARNOLD Q You mean distinctly to say he was to employ counsel and every other thing for £5 A Yes that was the agreement - I have not been heard before the court - I have been in prison since the 9th of July - this money being kept back has thrown me back a month PHILLIP FULLER I am a carpenter I have come from Harwich to give evidence - I employed Mr Norton as my attorney to get me through the insolvent court he procured my discharge - I saw the prisoner as Mr Norton s clerk in the course of the proceedings - I paid the prisoner 17s 6d on the 10th of September on account of Mr Norton Cross-examined Q When you paid that money you had been heard before the court A I had I had to pay 17s 6d into court before I could be discharged - I have certainly complained that Mr Norton neglected my business - I might have complained of that to Drew once or twice not more than twice for Drew had nothing to do with my business - when I paid him the 17s 6d I did not tell him to take it into court and not let Mr Norton have it COURT Q On what account did you pay the 17s 6d A For the clearance of the court MR ARNOLD Q On your oath did you not tell Drew to take it and pay it into court A I did I did not tell him that Mr Norton had very much neglected my business and I would not trust him any more - I saw the prisoner cross from the scratch as it is called and I said What am I detained here for I understand it is on account of 17s 6d not being paid into court what is to be done he said Give it to me I will see it paid in to-morrow that was how it occured - I recollect seeingthe prisoner at the Mansion-house - when the examination was over I went and spoke to him - I did not ask him in what way I could serve him - I did not say I should be sorry to hurt him nor that I would not have come forward if I could not have helped it - I said I want so to go home and not come here you are a bad man to detain me here - Norton did not give any paper to which I put my signature he paid the 17s 6d - I did not on that occasion sign a paper - I did not give him a receipt for it - Norton had paid it into court for me - I was discharged before I went to the Mansion-house - I did not tell the prisoner at the Mansion-house that I knew I had told him not to give the money to Norton on account of his having used me so ill LOUIS NORTON I went to the court to ascertain whether the prisoner had paid the 17s 6d I afterwards sent it up to the office as Fuller s discharge was delayed in consequence of it not being paid - I paid it again myself PHILIP FULLER I should not have paid the 17s 6d to the prisoner except as clerk to Mr Norton LOUIS NORTON I believe it is a custom for attorneys clerks to treat prisoners in the prison when they go to solicit business - he had no demand on me whatever on the score of treating prisoners I never authorised him to treat persons with a view to get their business - I never allowed him to deduct in a case what he spent in treating - he was only my clerk and was sent by me to the prison for particular reasons - I know in the insolvent court prisoners are treated but not by me - it never was done and that I can swear The prisoner being called on for his defence made a long and unconnected address to the court the substance of which was as follows - That by an order of the Insolvent Debtor s Court the attorneys were bound to register the names of their clerks in the books of that court which the prosecutor not having done the prisoner could not be considered as his clerk That the prosecutor was in his debt for having treated different inmates of the prison also 5s for every insolvent case that he obtained and for having worked over hours That he did not conceive he was bound to pay the 17s 6d over to the prosecutor inasmuch as it was given to him to pay into court That the 2l was paid him for the express purpose of employing counsel if requisite and being himself answerable for the money he did not think it right to give it over to the prosecutor and that he had incurred a greater expense in obtaining business in the prison the prosecutor having got into great disrepute there through neglecting his client s business and there was now an indictment against him for perjury COURT to LOUIS NORTON Q Was it any part of the prisoner s duty to receive money on your account A It was - he has received money on my account and paid it to me before MR PHILLIPS Q Is there a word of truth in the allegation that you are indicted for perjury A Decidedly not MR ARNOLD Q You are indicted for a conspiracy to charge another person with perjury A Yes it is an indictment preferred before that indictment is decided JOHN HILL I am an officer Mr Norton gave the prisoner into my custody - he said he had a demand against the prosecutor for extra services done - he did not say he had laid out money on the prosecutor s account - he did not produce a bill till the second examination - in the first instances he said it was for services done WILLIAM WOOD re-examined When I paid the prisoner the last sovereign I had an undertaking from him that counsel should be employed if requisite - it formed a part of the payment of 5l - it was all to be included in the 5l he was to pay it over to his employer JURY Q Did you distinctly understand he was to give the 2l over to his employer or was he himself to find counsel A He was to give it to his employer who was to find counsel GUILTY * Aged 37 -

I have a particular reason for thinking so as a servant s character was inclosed in it and the lady who sent it to me wished me to give it to the servant who was anxiously expecting the character to arrive the date of the post-mark is the 7th of August - it came from Lymington I inquired of him for the overcharge he always said he had not yet got it FRANCIS HARRISON I am a window clerk in the General Post-office it is my duty to make the rebate on overcharged letters I keep a book to enter the letters on which those overcharges are returned -

he should have given that to Mrs Collins the prisoner s signature is on this letter Single J Borrett I cannot swear to his hand-writing but if it had been written by any other person belonging to his district I should have given it to the prisoner seeing that name on the letter understanding what district it belonged to and knowing he delivered in that district I should have given the prisoner the money I have no doubt of the money and letter being given to him Cross-examined Q Not the slightest in the world A No I am certain I gave it him there is nothing particular which calls it to my recollection I return rebates every morning - I don t remember the identical letter nor giving him the 1s 6d on that identical letter - but I swear according to the book that I did return 1s 6d on that letter I will undertake to swear that I did give the prisoner 1s 6d as the rebate on that letter - I gave it to him to return to Mr Collins not Mrs Collins I gave him the money to return to the party to whom the letter was addressed he should not have given it to anybody else except to a branch of the family MR SHEPHERD Q Would he be justified in returning it to anybody Mr Collins authorised to receive it A Yes if his wife received the letter and paid the postage he would be justified in returning it to her I never gave the overcharged letter to a carrier without giving him the money as he would be answerable for it - he would not take it without the money JAMES AUSTIN I am inspector of letter carriers On the 2nd of November I searched the prisoner and found on him an overcharged letter this is it the words Single J Borrett are in his hand-writing if it were a double letter the word single would not be correct I asked him what that letter was when I found it and he said that was a neglect of his I asked him if he had received the postage for it he said Yes I meant the return of the overcharge nothing was said about any demand upon him for it - Mrs Collins name was not mentioned to him Cross-examined Q Where was this A At the post-office BENJAMIN CRITCHETT I am inspector of letter carriers to the post-office When a carrier receives any overcharge to be returned it is his duty to give it to the party the same day as he receives it MORRIS VINE I am clerk to the magistrates of Bow-street I took the depositions in the case between the Crown and the prisoner before Mr Halls the magistrate these are the depositions -

and said he had and stated what is written in the deposition when it was read over to him nothing more was said to him - I never ask a prisoner to sign his examination unless it be a confession - it was signed by the magistrate read The prisoner says I recollect taking a letter to Mrs Collins which is produced and I should imagine I received the rebate but I have not paid back to Mrs Collins the rebate if I had I should have given up the letter My not delivering the rebate and letter was a neglect of mine for I forgot to deliver it from day to day JAMES LEONARD I live at No 14 York-court East-street Manchester-square I have seen the prisoner there delivering letters - he brought me this letter looking at it - I paid 2s 10d for the postage - I opened it in his presence and shewed him that it was a single letter it came from Ireland - I required half the postage back again - he told me to give him the letter in a day or two and he would bring it to me with half the postage back again - I gave him the letter on the Saturday evening following in High-street while he was ringing his bell - the letter was directed to East-street Mary-le-bone - he found me out - I saw him on the Tuesday following in High-street and spoke to him about returning the letter but I did not expect he would have it then I told him I would meet him in High-street the next evening while he was ringing his bell and I met him on the following evening Thursday and asked him for my letter he put his hand to his side and said he had forgotten it I never saw him afterwards - I have never received my letter or money back - the letter was first delivered to me on a Tuesday or Wednesday - this Thursday was the Thursday week afterwards - I had not authorised him to keep the money he was to receive for me or to dispose of it Cross-examined Q How many times did you ask him to return you the overcharge A Once I believe I will swear I asked him once I asked him for the letter twice I did not ask him for the money but of course I meant to have the money with the letter - when he clapped his hand to his side he appeared to be feeling for the letter in his pocket and then said he had forgotten it the letter is now torn across MR ADOLPHUS Q It has been out of your possession all this while A Yes when he took the letter from me he said he would return me half the postage which would be 1s 5d - when I asked him for the letter I expected the postage also - I know this to be the same letter from the inside of it THOMAS BARROWS I am clerk in the General Postoffice - it is my duty to make rebates on overcharged letters looking at the letter - I have no recollection of this letter but here is a figure of mine on it which enables me to say that it has passed through my hands looking at the Rebate book - here is an entry dated 28th of October which I believe refers to this letter it does not correspond entirely with it the entry is Mr Wells 14 York-street postage 2s 10d 1s 5d allowed sometimes mistakes occur in entering the directions of letters but not often I have no doubt whatever but that entry refers to that letter - the book is signed by J Deacon Cross-examined Q Have you any recollection of returning the rebate A Not the slightest these transactions are too numerous for me to recollect them this 1s 5d was put on the letter by me Q Do you swear that when you entered Mr Wells 14 York-street you were copying from a letter with Mr James Leonard 14 York-court on it A Yes I believe it is the same the direction was obliterated and I read it Wells to the best of my recollection - I misread Wells for James but I believe it to be the letter from the correspondence between the entry and the letter - I have no recollection of it except from the book I read James for Wells I did not see the surname - I may have copied that entry from some other letter to the best of my belief I did MR SCARLETT Q The two figures on the letters are yours A I have no doubt of it I have made no similar entry of 1s 5d for any other letter that day - I entered two pages of overcharged letters that morning - when I have a great many it sometimes occurs that one name is put for another - my sight is not very good JOHN DEACON I am letter-carrier of the same division as the prisoner my signature is to this book - on the 28th of October here is a letter entered in the name of Wells 14 York-street I have signed the book for the amount of money for that division I delivered the letters to the different carriers - the entry here is Wells 14 York-street but I only sign for the amount I receive - I did not receive a letter that day directed to 14 York-street - there is a letter entered here 14 York-street but I did not receive such a letter - my signature is to the book as having received 5s 9d for rebates belonging to my division - there is a York-street in our division - this letter is directed York-court East-Street Manchester-square that is in the prisoner s delivery - I have no means of saying whether I received that letter with the overcharge - the prisoner receives the rebate letters from me - the direction of this letter is in his walk and his name is attached to the letter in his writing - the letter shows it has been overcharged and the money returned - that letter and the rebate would be delivered to him in due course I should have delivered it to the prisoner - the Post-office date on it is the 23rd of October when it went out of the office first - I have no doubt but that I delivered that letter to the prisoner but at what time I cannot say - the address of the letter is not correctly copied into the book there is no such an address in it for that day there is an address of Wells &c with exactly the same amount of postage Cross-examined Q Will you undertake to swear you gave any person the overcharge on that letter A Yes positively but not to the time - it must have been after the 23rd of October that I gave it to the prisoner - I have no recollection of giving it to him no more than in the general way as I gave him them every morning as he sits in his seat and the money also - he sits the third man from me and I gave him the whole sum - I received the rebate from a man named Reed a sorter it came from the window of the Inland-office GEORGE LEADBITTER I am a Bow-street officer On the 2nd of November I searched the prisoner and found on him this letter in a pocket-book in his coat-pocket - there were more letters of the same kind in his pocketbook - I asked him about this one letter in particular hesaid he had neglected to return the postage and that he had to meet the man at the corner of the street but he had not seen him he did not mention the man s name but I inquired why he had not returned the money to Leonard he said he had neglected to do so and had to meet him as before GUILTY of Embezzling the 1s 6d -

t18331128-35  36 JOHN HAYNES was indicted for embezzlement MR PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution BENJAMIN EVANS I am second waiter to Mr Taylor I attend his lower coffee-room in Titchbourn-street the prisoner was waiter to his up-stairs coffee-room it was my duty to account to the prisoner for what money I received twice every day - on the 28th of October I gave him some money with this paper with 1l 4s 0d in silver and copper - it was the custom to give him a paper of this kind when I gave him any money - this paper I gave him on the 29th of October with 1l 11s 0d - and this paper on the 30th of October with 1l 7s 9d - these are all in my hand-writing - on the 31st of October the prisoner went out soon after six o clock in the morning and did not return till he was brought by the officer Cross-examined by MR WHALESBY Q It was your duty to give the money you received from customers to the head waiter A Yes I had to account to him twice a day - I understood he had the tradesmen to pay but I had no particular knowledge of his duty - I made these memorandums a little before I gave him the money then I counted the money in a saucer and delivered it to the prisoner - Mr Taylor showed me these papers again on the night following and said he was very happy that he had left the papers behind him - the dates on these papers were not written at the time I wrote the sums of money - they were written the evening the prisoner absconded - I saw him walk out of the house with a box on his shoulder and a trunk in his hand - I did not think there was anything suspicious in his going out - I used the word absconded because I heard the officer use it - I never gave money to my master but settled with the prisoner - I never was in a coffee shop before I had lived there three months - I had before been with Mr Egan in Blackfriars-road as light porter - I believe there was at Mr Taylor s a box called the waiter s-box with a hole in the top - I do not know what was the use of it but I had seen it in the bar belonging to the room up-stairs - I do not know whether it was locked MR PHILLIPS Q You have used the term absconded did you expect him to return A Yes he did not give me or any one in the house the slightest intimation that he was going to High-Wycomb WILLIAM TAYLOR The prisoner was in my service he gave me no notice that he was about to leave me -he was with me for three or four years - he never accounted to me for either of the sums mentioned by the last witness which it was his duty to have done - I heard he had left on the 31st of October - I went to Titchbourn-street - I did not find the key in the till - I broke it open and found 2l 0s 6d in silver and 5s 6 1/2d in copper - my daughter had presided there - she was just turned seventeen years of age - I found she had also left - in consequence of information I went on the 1st of November to High-Wycomb I found the prisoner there and my daughter - the prisoner is married and has four children - I collared him when I found him in a public-house and made use perhaps of improper words I said You d-d infernal villain where is the money you have robbed me of - he said I have none of your money I left it all in the till - I said No you have not I am positive - he quickly replied You cannot swear that I gave him in charge and brought my daughter to town with me - these memoranda were in a cup on a shelf where the prisoner generally kept his papers Cross-examined Q He had been three or four years in your service A Yes I knew him when he was in business for himself he had been unfortunate and applied to me and I employed him - there was nothing to prevent him from taking these papers away the till was in the counter and could be taken out if it was unlocked - there is a box called the waiter s box it was used for him to put his pence or perquisites in he might put other things in but not to my knowledge - that stood on the shelf close by where I found these papers - I had the prisoner and Evans and two female servants in my employ - the prisoner had so much control of the other waiter that if he had misconducted himself he would have complained of him to me - the prisoner had my place when I was out but he had not to pay bills unless I gave orders if the postman came he might have paid him I left money for the newsman - on the Monday before this I left 7l with the prisoner which he appropriated properly by paying 6l 16s 4d out of it as I had directed him - I left money for the rent he had paid 74l about a month previous to this and if it had been ten times that sum I should have left it with him - I could not have ascertained so correctly what money had been in the till had it not been for these papers but I keep a cheque and could have told nearly what was deficient the prisoner generally settled with me every night but it was never longer than a week I should always settle with him on the Sunday morning though I might have received money of him three or four times in the week there was no writing at the time of our settlement but what I chose to make in my own book he paid for the muffins out of the money which he took but on no occasion made any advances they were not more than 1s or 1s 6d a day he made no advance to me - I may on two or three occasions when I have been going out have said to him Let me have two or three shillings to save my going up stairs which he has done and put it down and deducted it in his account the next day - the key of the till was found after I broke it open I think my servant gave it me the next morning the 1st of November - if she had the key she could certainly open the till - I do not know where the prisoner usually kept that key I believe he sometimes put it in his box - I was never violent in my temper towards my daughter I have expressed myself in violent terms to several persons since I have discovered this unhappy affair I have not in her presence expressed myself so as to excite apprehension in her mind - I did not discover it till the 31st of October when the prisoner and she absconded I had not suspected it before - my daughter is not here to-day - she was with the prisoner when I found him at High Wycomb I do not know whether she made any remark if she did I was too much agitated to hear it - I have never expressed to any one my determination to be revenged on the prisoner for the wrong done to my daughter Q Now recollect Mr Taylor have you never said you would prosecute him for this wrong to your daughter even if it cost you your life A I certainly should do so I do not know that I used those words but no doubt they imply my meaning in answer to an observation about being lenient to the parties MR PHILLIPS Q Had you your daughter educated at school A Yes she had returned from school seven months ago three weeks before her mother died she had been at school thirteen or fourteen years - I never used harsh language towards her - I have expressed myself angrily towards the prisoner since I discovered this but not towards my daughter ELIZABETH BUNDOCK I am in the prosecutor s service - I did not see the prisoner leave but I heard about seven o clock in the morning of the 31st of October that he had gone - I wrote to my master and he came in the evening - no one had access to the till before my master came it was locked I saw him break it open - I afterwards found the key in the waiter s box on the shelf up stairs and when my master came I gave it him - I saw the prisoner on the evening before the 31st in the bar up stairs - I saw him take 3l in silver from the till he said to the other servant who was then up stairs I want you to fetch me two pennyworth of rum and take this 3l in silver and bring me three sovereigns for it - and if you meet your master say you are going for some rum but do not say you are going for change - I saw the girl return she gave the prisoner the three sovereigns he sounded them on the counter put them into his purse and put them into his pocket that was from eight to nine o clock Cross-examined Q What are you A Kitchenmaid I am engaged up stairs to assist the head-waiter in anything he wishes - the waiter s-box in which I found the key was not locked the key was not concealed - I don t know whether it was usually kept there - when the prisoner went away I took the place and when the shop was shut at night I went to the box from curiosity to see how much I had had given me and there I found the key I had always before seen the prisoner lock the till and put the key into his pocket the other girl is not here - I did not go to look for the key when my master asked me where it was - I found the key between eleven and twelve o clock at night - Miss Taylor lived in that house I waited upon her I had not noticed any thing particular in her appearance before she went away but I thought she was very lively in spirits the night before - I have lived there six months - I had seen the prisoner pay 1s for muffins or the like of that but no more THOMAS DREW I am an inspector of the police - the prisoner was brought to the station-house between eight and nine o clock at night the officer who brought him said he had searched him I searched him again and found on him four sovereigns and a half 1l 18s 6d in silver and 5d in copper Prisoner s Defence I paid money to different tradespeople and the prosecutor has vouchers to prove it he did not leave me any 7l at all - I laid out these sums in his business WILLIAM TAYLOR I left the 7l on the Monday morning before previous to my going to my other house in the City - I ordered him to pay the newsman his week s account and to get 5l worth of coke and pay for it GUILTY Aged 32 - Transported for Seven Years 
t18340102-126  310 HENRY SMITH again indicted for embezzling the sum of £14 1s 6d which he had received on account of Elias Moses and another his masters ISAAC MOSES On the 29th of September the prisoner was in our employ - I gave him a cheque on Barnett Hoare & Co which I produce - I directed him to get cash for it - it was for £14 1s 6d - he never returned with it - I have never received the cash for it - he was not apprehended till the 9th of December - my father was in partnership with me - he was the servant of us both - the money was for our joint use RICHARD BESCOBY I am clerk in Messrs Barnett s banking-house No 62 Lombard-street - I cashed this cheque on account of a country bank - it is an order to pay Moses and Son the money - I have no recollection of the person who received it ALEXANDER BROOKFIELD I am an officer of Cheap Ward - I apprehended the prisoner on the 9th of December in Lawrence-lane - I named to him the affair of Mr Moses - he said he had been truly unhappy ever since for it was not an affair of his own - I asked him what he had done with the cheque - I had heard of the circumstance from Mr Moses - I asked him what he had done with the goods - he said it was not an act of his own - he had trusted them to another man - it was his duty to deliver them himself but he did not do it - I said Why you were trusted with a cheque the next day - he said That likewise was an act of the same person s - I said You never returned with it - he said no he was ashamed - he did not say he had received the money nor that he had not - he mentioned the person s name and I knew him perfectly well the same as Roe does - I knew the prisoner two years before he lived in King-street at Dewhey Farmer & Co and at that time this man used to be at the corner of Guildhall-yard getting different jobs but he was known to be a bad character and I think the prisoner must have known he had left his place for some dishonesty - it was well known he was a man who could not get a constant situation - the prisoner did not say who got the cheque cashed - he said it was an act the same as the other - he did not say what became of the cheque nor who had the money Prisoner I never knew he was discharged for dishonesty - I had it in my power to give him a job and gave him one - it is quite correct what the constable states GUILTY Aged 27 - Transported for Seven Years - to commence from the expiration of his former sentence 
t18340102-129  NEW COURT Monday January 2 1834 Third Middlesex Jury before Mr Common Sergeant 313 HENRY COX was indicted for embezzlement The witnesses did not appear NOT GUILTY HENRY COX was again indicted for embezzlement and larceny MR PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution JAMES DIGNAM I am a solicitor - the prisoner was in my service - I intrusted him with a sum of money for the general purposes of the office - he had to pay the fees in the case of Godding and Abbott in the Court of King s Bench - he told me he had paid 2l 16s 6d for Court fees - I have his book here in which it was his duty to put down any money he laid out and he has put down 2l 16s 6d - I afterwards had some conversation with the clerk of the King s Bench and spoke to the prisoner - I told him I could find no voucher for 1l 7s which was the amount of marshall s fees in that case - he said the voucher for the marshall s fees was with the record and he had paid it - I am sure he said that Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q I believe you were unwell at the time A Yes it was on the 27th of November - I was ill and not able to attend business - the prisoner had to conduct the case of Godding and Abbott - I gave him money at various times and he received money from other persons which he has entered in this book WILLIAM HENRY WATERS I am clerk to the Chief Justice of the King s Bench - I remember the trial of Godding and Abbott - the marshall s fees in that case amounted to 1l 7s - I asked the prisoner for them - he said he would call on the morrow and pay them - I afterwards demanded them of Mr Dignam and he paid them - the prisoner did not call the next day as he promised - I did not see him again till he was in custody Cross-examined Q I believe it was a busy day A No it was not - that was the very last case we had that day - I do not remember the prisoner having the ticket for thesefees of me and it was not likely he had as I found I had it afterwards - I do not think it likely that I gave it him and here turned it JAMES DIGNAM re-examined Q You say you had a case of Godding and Abbott did you give the prisoner any money specifically for the charges of that case A He had sufficient money in hand for the general purposes of the office - it was his duty to apply any money he had in hand for that case and he told me he had done it - he told me he had paid the marshall s fees in that case amounting to 1l 7s - I told him I had looked among the papers and could not find the usual voucher for them - he said he had paid them and the voucher was with the record - the prisoner was in the receipt of monies and he had a balance of several pounds in his hands - he received on the 23d of November from the defendant Abbott 8l expressly to pay the court and counsel fees in that case - he received that 8l for me - he accounts in his book for the receipt of this 8l Cross-examined Q This book is kept by the prisoner A Yes it is in his handwriting - I had access to the book but I was confined by illness but he brought the book to me - I cannot tell whether he brought it between the 23d and the 27th of November it is probable that he did and that I saw this entry of the 8l if I did I allowed the money to remain in his hands for the purposes of the office but he told me that Abbott had paid the 8l - I cannot tell when he told me so - he had money from me as he wanted it Prisoner s Defence During the last few months the want of employment and other circumstances had involved me in difficulties from which I could not extricate myself which made me a prey to care and anxiety In this state I entered my prosecutor s service where I had a prospect of retrieving my circumstances which have been disappointed Just before the trial for which the fees in question were payable I had seen the prosecutor he expressed himself satisfied with my attention to the business and said no doubt Mr Abbott would make me an acknowledgment and give me two sovereigns this was peculiarly agreeable to me and having a balance in my hands belonging to the prosecutor I was not so careful of it as I should have been after the trial in that case I paid the jury fees and took the ticket for them I then went to Mr Waters he handed me the ticket for the Marshall s fees but having only 8s or 10s I could not pay them I told him I would go and get the money of Mr Abbott I went to see for him but could not find him I returned to the Court gave Mr Waters the ticket back and told him I would call and pay him the first time I passed that way I then went to the prosecutor s house and told him the verdict was for his client he was much pleased took me by the hand and gave me wine but I never received the two sovereigns and then my hopes were disappointed I intended to pay these fees but as I knew they were not wanted I did not pay them immediately though every professional man knows I could not have taxed the costs without paying them and I should therefore have done so I beg to state that on the morning of the day on which the prosecutor gave me into custody he informed me he thought I should not suit him and desired me to leave and call the next morning to balance my book I said it was unusual to leave at so short a notice and we both agreed that I should stay the week and I had every opportunity of making my escape I will not deny that my conduct has been imprudent but I trust for the sake of my friends you will pause before you pronounce a verdict which will brand me with infamy - for which I shall be truly grateful to the latest period of my life MR DIGNAM The prisoner had no opportunity of escaping after this charge was made - the costs could not have been taxed without this money having been paid - I generally tax the costs myself and then I must have sworn that these fees had been paid but the master would have required to see the ticket for them Prisoner Have I not taxed the costs while you were ill Witness Yes JURY Q Did you not promise him two sovereigns or lead him to expect them from Abbott A Never Francis Hebert solicitor and Thomas Dunnett of Grange Court Carey-street gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 21 -

he was to bring back the money - I carry on business in the name of Williams and Co - I am the only person interested in the business - Mr Thorne of Bucklersbury is a customer - I sent the prisoner about the 12th of September with a pair of boots which came to sixteen shillings which he was to bring back - he came back and told me Thorne was in great haste - that he was going into the country for a few days and would call when he came back and pay me - I have a customer named Frederick William Montague a surveyor -

that was on the 4th of September - he brought me back no money - Richard Heatley owed me 7l 14s 9d - I sent the prisoner on the 16th of September for it - he came back told me Mr Heatley was in the country and would not return for a fortnight to come - he brought me no money from him - the prisoner had twenty shillings a week wages and boarded in the house Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you go by any other name than Burchett - A No nor ever have - I have never gone by the name of Williams - I have no cause to sign that name - we make out bills of parcels as Williams & Co - I might have signed a bill in the name of Williams & Co - I attend to the business COURT Q Have you held yourself out to the world or led people to suppose your name is Williams - A Not at all MR CLARKSON Q That you mean to swear - A Certainly - many customers deal with me and may not know but that I am Mr Williams - I have never given them reason to believe that I was Mr Williams or that I was not - I may have put Williams & Co when I have received money - I have put the name of Burchett more frequently than Williams - Mr Williams became a bankrupt and Mr Hurder took the stock - he was security to the assigness - Williams is my brother-in-law and so is Hurder - Williams s name is rated in the parish books - the business is in the name of Williams - it goes on as itdid before - Mr Hurder s name is not entered in the gas rate-book Q Is Mr Williams who has become a bankrupt a lunatic - A He is at present at liberty - he is generally reported to be out of his mind - he is in business at the corner of Fetter-lane - he is a shoemaker - he carried on business where I do before he was a bankrupt - after he became a bankrupt Mr Hurder was security for the stock - Williams went away - his name remained on the door and I took the concern - I think that is about four years ago - I did not take his name from that time - I never represented my name to my customers at all - if they had asked my name I should have told them certainly - if a person asked my name I have told it them - I have not represented that Mr Williams was the owner of the business and that I was employed under him - I swear that Q Do you remember on any occasion of a summons being taken out against a supposed debtor of the firm of the name of Britain - Yes I summoned him for a debt - I am free of the city Q How long have you been free - A I do not know that I am compelled to state - I do not choose to tell you- when I summoned Britian I did not represent that the business was not mine and take out a summons in the name of Williams and sign the name of Williams - on the contrary the summons was taken out in both names - both my name and Williams were given in as the firm stood in Williams s name - they would not grant a summons without both names were given in - I remember the shop being robbed at one time by a man who was charged with it - the prisoner was a principal witness on that occasion and I then told the prisoner as the name of the firm was Williams he ought to have given in the name of Williams - I did not tell him to state that I was managing the concern for Williams who was a lunatic - I might have told him to say Williams was a lunatic - I do not remember that I did - I cannot say either way - I did not tell him to say anything - I merely said as the firm went by that name that it would be more proper to give in the name of Williams as the prosecutor COURT Q Did you mean you recommended him to give the name of Williams as the prosecutor when he was not - A It was after the prosecution he gave in my name - I said I think you ought to have given the name of Williams - not as proprietor of the goods - I did not instruct him to state the property belonged to Williams MR CLARKSON Q You did not hear him state that A I was not present - I never told him to say Williams was owner of the goods or that I managed the business for him - I did not say I had rather the man had got clear than I should be represented as the proprietor - I think I can swear that - I will not swear it Q Pray did you tell the magistrate when you went before him that the firm of Williams and Co kept no books A We do not keep books - I have a book which I call a memorandum-book - we sell for ready money - I could not say that we kept no books because I produced a book - I said we did not book goods - I did not state we kept no books whatever - I said we kept no book but a memorandum-book - I said that the first time - when I was before the magistrate the second time I said I had a memorandum-book and a book merely for me to put down daily accounts - the third time I produced another book and said that was all the books I had - we have a book in which we enter measures but nothing of money transactions - that book is for orders and addresses - I only keep those three books - I never had any destroyed - one is a memorandum-book the other merely states the money taken in the day - I have that here it contains the account of the receipts of the till - I never had any more than these three books - I do not keep a bill-book - I do not enter bills in any book - I have no Bills of Exchange - they pass through my hands in business - I accept bills in the course of business one two three or four perhaps in a month - not so many as fifty - I have no book in which I keep an account of those bills - I make a note of them on loose papers which I put into my desk - they are not afterwards sewn together - I never had a bill-book to enter bills in - my son knows nothing about my bill transactions - the business is transacted in my name and I accept them in my own name - I never accepted a bill in the name of Williams never in my life and never kept a bill-book - those three books are all I have kept - if anybody should say I kept more than that he would be mistaken - Mr Hurder is in court - he has nothing to do with the business of Williams and Co - he is attending merely out of curiosity - he has no interest in the business at all - I purchased the stock from him - I had been in business in the same line before in Crown-street Finsbury - I live there now - Mr Hurder lives in the house where the business is carried on - it is let to him - nobody constitutes the firm of Williams and Co but myself - I have not allowed my children to receive money on my account for the last two years - I had a person in my service of the name of Baines - I have not the third book here it is merely an order-book and memorandum-book - I believe there is not a shilling of money entered in it - I am sure of that - I had no motive at all for keeping that book back - I could produce it in a few minutes if you wish - I am not in the habit of drawing bills on Williams and Co - I never did such a thing - I accept bills in my own name Q Did not you prove under Williams s estate A Yes I did not on bills I will swear that - I proved a debt - I think it was for goods he had of me - that is the same Williams and Co whose name is over the door RICHARD HEATLEY I live in Mincing-lane Q In September last were you indebted to Mr Burchett for goods A I do not know anybody of that name - I know the prosecutor - I was not aware who I was indebted to - I had goods from the shop in Cheapside with Williams and Co over the door - I owed that concern 7l 14s 9d - I think I paid that sum of money on the 15th of September - I took a receipt for it and hold it in my hand - I have not the least recollection of the person to whom I paid it- I gave him a draft on my bankers WILLIAM BURCHETT That is the prisoner s handwriting - the date of this ought to have been the 16th Monday - the 15th was Sunday RICHARD HEATLEY I do not recollect the date Cross-examined Q Had you dealt with the house any length of time A This bill appears to have run on a few months - I do not think I was ever in the shop in mylife - it is a cheap shop at which my children are in the habit of getting ready-made shoes - I have not the least knowledge of Williams whatever - I never knew the name of Burchett - I cannot say who I paid the cheque to - receipt read MR FREDERICK WILLIAM MONTAGUE I was supplied with boots from a house in cheapside to the amount of 1l 6s - I paid the party who brought them home at the time - he gave me a memorandum at the bottom of the bill- this is it WILLIAM BURCHETT This memorandum is the prisoner s handwriting and the bill itself is his MR CLARKSON Q I think you said you paid the prisoner his wages A Yes always - it was never paid by Hurder not from the time I took possession of the property - he did not pay him in 1831 nor 1832 - he looked to me for his wages and I paid him MR MONTAGUE I did not hear of the name of Burchett before this - I know the prosecutor by going into the shop to purchase the boots and saw him there - I did not hear him call himself by any name THOMAS THORN I live in Bucklersbury - in September last I saw the prisoner - I paid him sixteen shillings about the 13th of February for a pair of boots which I had from Mr Williams s No 29 Cheapside - I never saw Mr Burchett till he waited on me on this business - I frequently send to the shop for shoes but never was in the shop - I paid the prisoner the money - it is a ready-money business and I took no memorandum of the payment - I did not know Mr Williams nor whether he was a servant Cross-examined Q You said you did not know whetheir it was Mr Williams or a servant A Yes - I mean the prisoner I did not know whether he was Mr Williams - I never saw Burchett - I never heard of his name till he came to me - I knew nothing of Williams or Burchett s concerns MR HURDER examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you know when Mr Burchett took up his freedom A No I do not know whether he was free of the City when the prisoner was taken into custody - I have not heard him say so - I will swear that - I do not know whether he has taken it out since this prosecution - I sold the business to Mr Burchett in 1829 as agent to the assignees - the prisoner has fetched goods from my house in Skinner-street COURT Q Do you know whether Mr Burchett carried on the business on his own account A I know on my oath that he has since 1829 MR CLARKSON Q When did williams the lunatic become a bankrupt A In 1829 - Mr Barker of Northampton-place and Mr Brown of Bermondsey the two assignees had all the property - I had my share of it - I had a dividend - I had the whole of the goods - I had no goods out of Willimas s shop after his bankruptey nor before - I never had any of his goods COURT Q You have been asked if any of the goods belonging to the bankrupt came into your possession A When he became a bankrupt two assignees were chosen - Barker and Brown were the two assignees and they gave the whole of the property into my hands as their agent - I sold it on their account and they received every farthing of the money - I was employed by the assignees to realize what I could from the property - I did not sell all the goods - he had all the goods in Cheapside but there are four other shops - Burchett paid the price put on the goods by the assignees WM BURCHETT re-examined Q When did you make yourself free of the City A I have made two or three applications but did not take it till to-day - I made my first application two or three weeks ago - the prisoner was taken on the 3d of January - I think it was after that time I applied for the freedom but I cannot say to a certainty COURT Q Why did you apply for it just now A It had nothing to do with this prosecution MR CLARKSON Q Were you not cross-examined by the magistrate as to whether you had taken out your freedom before he would commit the prisoner A No it was not put to me at all - the question was asked me by the attorney but not by the magistrate - the magistrate said he had nothing to do with it Prisoner s Defence Deeply sensible as I feel at being placed in so disgraceful a situation and knowing myself innocent I entreat you duly to consider every circumstance You will observe by the evidence that I have been for four years engaged in a house of business for some mysterious motive or other carried on by three or four different names each one appearing in the character of proprietor until some peculiar circumstance calls for the right owner of the property - and one is immediately put forward as such proprictor - such is the case now Burchett has nothing to do with the property nor indeed half so much as Hurder I was hired by Hurder and paid several times by him and I have been in the habit of making out bills and receipts of the firm always in the name of Williams and on the occasion of a man robbing his shop I solemnly and distinctly swear he cautioned me not to name him in court for the penalties he would incur for doing business without his freedom and he said Rather than name it before the grand jury let the bill be thrown out Had my counsel have called his son I should have been borne out in that by the witness Before the magistrate at the examination he distinctly swore he kept no books - it can clearly be seen by the jury if they will inspect the manner the cash-book is kept it is a mere jargon of figures which no gentleman can understand The prosecution is merely malicious because they were aware one of the firm or party would have proceedings instituted against them and to get me out of the way being almost the oldest servant in the concern they bring the charge - there are eight persons who receive money the prosecutor Mr Hurder Williams the lunatic the uncertificated bankrupt has even received money in the shop due to the firm under his own name and put it in his pocket and laughed at the way he was cheating the assignees - this is a fact my fellow shopman Barnes would bear me out - it was usual for me on receiving monies immediately to pay them to whoever was in the shop empowered to receive them - they could produce two or three hundred bills in my handwriting and receipts - I was desired by Burchett never to sign his name but Williams s which I always did- I never objected to sign my own name if a customer asked it - I call your particular attention to the fact that none of the witnesses could say I received the money nor did I I never received a halfpenny from either of the gentlemen appearing against me - the prosecutor begged Mr Alderman Winchester I believe to punish me in a summary way to give me a month and not to have anything more to do with it he refused - he was asked to produce his books and he swore he had none - I am certain the inspection of the book will clear me from any charge - several customers have paid money - there is not a distinction made if a customer paid 2l 10s and another 2s it would be immediately placed in the book as 2l 12s WILLIAM SMITH I carry on the business of a whalebone cutter at No 71 St Paul s Church-yard - I have known the prisoner these fifteen or sixteen years - I had dealings with his father - I always heard he has been a very honest boy - I have also dealt with Williams and Co Cheapside for myself and children - I have paid the prisoner in the shop and he has immediately gone to the desk and given the money to the party there - sometimes I have seen this gentleman who passed as proprietor of that shop and I always knew him by the name of Williams - his son this very day or a servant in his employ served me with a pair of boots - I paid the money to his son I believe as he said his name was Burchett at the desk Edward Longden plumber Drury-lane Jasper Croggan ale-brewer No 12 Little Carter-lane and Lawrence Cronin Flight-street Wapping gave the prisoner a good character Mr BURCHETT re-examined Nobody but myself and son make entries in the books GUILTY Aged 34 -

t18341205-314  314 JOSEPH AUTEY was indicted for embezzlement MESSRS CLARKSON and GURNEY conducted the Prosecution CHARLES BURLS I am secretary to the Gas Light and Coke Company They have a station in Horseferry-road Westminster—the prisoner was a collector—his district included the Albany and the parish of St George Hanover-square—the rents were collected quarterly—it was his duty after collecting the money to return to the office at Westminster and enter those sums from his collecting-book into a cash-book at the office—this is one of his collecting-books looking at one —he enters the names of the debtors to the Company here before he receives the money—when he receives it he enters the date and the amount—he attends weekly at the office—he enters in the cash-book what he receives and from whom—he then signs the account—there is also an abstract of the sums received made and signed by him—this is his collecting-book to June last—here are two sums of 34l 13s each entered as due from the Albany Q If these sums were received by the prisoner on the 16th of June what was it his duty to do A To enter them in this book as received—these are not so entered—it would not be his duty to enter more than the sums he received he should enter the date—he attended at the office at the close of that week to make up his accounts—if on the week following the 16th of June he had received any sums he should have entered them—the entries of that week are signed by the prisoner—if he had received these two sums in June they ought to appear in this column of the abstract under the head of Public Accounts received —it is divided into public and private accounts—those sums do not appear here Q If on the 26th of September he received 2102l 10s from the parish of St George Hanover-square ought that to appear in this book A Certainly—it does not appear but the sum of 2101l 18s 8d is entered which is composed of the quarter due at Lady-day 1050l 10s 2d and the quarter to Midsummer 1051l 8s 6d —there is no return made of the quarter ending at Michaelmas—there is no return of the sum of 1051l 1s 6d for Michaelmas—it does not appear in the abstract—this is the weekly book signed by him—it does not appear in that COURT Q This sum ought to have appeared in both those documents A Certainly MR GURNET Q Previous to the 4th of this month had you made any inquiry of the officers of the Company A Yes and in consequence of what I learned I summoned Mr Autey to attend the office in Bridge-street—he attended on a Thursday I think the 4th of this month—the Committee of Accounts who were then sitting put questions to him—I had prepared a list of sum s which I have here and he was called upon to explain discrepancies in the accounts he was first asked - - Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Was he not told that it would be to his interest to make a full statement A No not in my presence MR GURNEY Q What question was put to him A First whether he had received the Albany account to Midsummer—he said he had—he was then asked if he had received the account of the parish of St George Hanover-square to Michaelmas 1834—the turn of 1051l 1s 6d was mentioned—he said he had—he was then asked what he had done with the money—he said he could not tell he had a large family—there were other sums mentioned to him MR PHILLIPS Q Was a gentleman named Bateman in the room A Yes he is one of the directors—he did not say he had better make a full confession WILLIAM BATEMAN ESQ I am one of the directors of this Company I was present at the committee of accounts when the prisoner was brought before them—there was a discussion about the receipt of various sums by him—I requested him to state the whole amount of his defalcation but without any pledge or promise of any kind—I said nothing about his being given into custody—I did not say it would be better for him to be candid—I desired him to be candid and give a correct account because as one of the committee I was anxious to give a correct account to the Company MR GURNEY to MR BURLS Q Was any other question put to the prisoner A He was asked to state the amount of hit deficit—he said he could not at the moment—he was then asked whether it was as much as 3000l —he said No it was about 2 500l Cross-examined Q How many of the committee were present A There were four present but I believe only Mr Bateman questioned him—I am not aware that any one put a question to him beside—I summoned him to attend and stated that it was to attend the committee of accounts—that was not a usual summons but he attended promptly and fairly—I suppose the prisoner might receive about 25 000l in the course of a year in divers sums large and small—I should say it was not likely mistakes could be made in the accounts—Mr Autey was remarkably correct Q Was he allowed to deposit the sums he received at his own private banker s A I believe he did—I am not aware that the directors knew of it—I did not then know that every payment he made to the Company was by a cheque on his own bankers but I know it now—I am not aware of any rule to prohibit the collecting clerks holding more than 100l in their hands—I am not aware of any specified amount which they might keep in their hands—the business is conducted at three different stations—I am secretary to the Company generally—I know of no such rule—there are arrear collectors to collect the arrears of the collector s books—I think it is their business to collect private accounts—I will not swear that they do not collect public accounts—a gentleman named Suffield is chief clerk in the light office—it was his duty to collect the returns made during the current quarter—it is his duty to transfer any arrears into the arrear collector s books—I think the prisoner has been in the Company s employ sixteen or seventeen years—I do not know him in private COURT Q What are the two sums in this book £1050 10s 2d and £1051 8s 6d A These are the sums due for the two quarters and against them is written 26—9 meaning the 26th of September MR PHILLIPS Q These books were of course regularly handed to you A No not to me to the collector—the prisoner made out his account and handed it to the collector—I have seen the receipt of what he had received and he admitted that he had received it at the committee of accounts—that he had received the two sums amounting to 2102l 10s on the 26th of September COURT Q Do you mean that he stated that he had received those sums that day or that on that day he had funds amounting to that sum A He admitted that he had received on the 26th of September of the parish of St George Hanover-square two sums amounting to 2102l 10s Q Then was the parish of St George Hanover-square one quarter in arrear A No the Lady Day quarter he made no return of having received—when he received these two sums he made a return for the Lady-day and Midsummer quarters whereas in point of fact he that day received the Midsummer and the Michaelmas quarters MR PHILLIPS Q When was it the duty of the collectors to return their accounts to the arrears collectors A I believe there was no regular time it was left to their discretion—the arrear collector was not a check on the other collectors but to collect those accounts which would require more time than the other collectors could give—there have been three different arrear collectors appointed—I believe the prisoner has a large family—he had an opportunity of absconding if he had chosen MR CLARKSON Q You have been asked upon the subject of mistakes—when the prisoner was asked those questions before the committee of accounts did he allege that he had made any mistakes A Not at all—the collecting clerk should pay his monies in when he received it not at his own discretion—if he had received the Lady-day quarter in March he certainly ought to have entered it—the Lady-day and Midsummer quarters due from St George Hanover-square do not make the same aggregate as the quarters of Midsummer and Michaelmas do—I think the difference is 8s 6d or 8s 8d —he inserts on the 26th of September the sums arising from Lady-day and Midsummer and has omitted the Michaelmas quarter entirely—he received on that day 2 102l 10s being the amount for Midsummer and Michaelmas and has entered 2 101l 18s 8d being the amount of Lady-day and Midsummer—in this book the account of St George Hanover-square to Michaelmas is 1051l 1s 6d —it is entered as a debt and not paid and this is one of the items on which he was examined before the committee of accounts which he admitted he had received—and when asked what he had done with the money said he did not know COURT Q If the September quarter did not become due till the 29th how could you expect it should appear in this book on the 26th A It does not appear MR PHILLIPS Q When does it appear as a debt A On the 29th WILLIAM THOMAS LUXMOORE I reside in the Albany The Gas Light and Coke Company were employed to light that place—on the 16th of June I paid the prisoner on account of the Gas Light and Coke Company 69l 6s by a cheque on Drummonds the bankers JAMES JOHN MILLS I am clerk to Messrs Drummonds—I have a cheque for 69l 6s dated the 16th of June 1834 which I paid MR LUXMOORE This is the cheque I gave him Cross-examined Q I believe the prisoner gave you a receipt at once A Yes MR CLARKSON Q Was the receipt on a wrong stamp A I believe it was—this is it MR BURLS re-examined I could not swear to the prisoner s hand-writing Cross-examined Q Have you not been swearing to his handwriting all the evening A I have never seen him write—I believe the entries to be his writing CHARLES WINNALL DALTON I have seen the prisoner write frequently—this name of Ransom and Co across the cheque is his writing—these books and abstracts are also his writing ROBERT LEES I am clerk to the paving-board of the parish of St George Hanover-square We are supplied with gas from the Gas Light Company—on the 24th of March last I paid the prisoner 1 050l 10s 2d by a cheque on Messrs Drummonds—I drew the cheque—it was signed by three committee-men and I counter-signed it—it was for gas supplied from Christmas to the 25th of Marsh 1834—the next payment I made to the prisoner was on the 26th of September when I paid him 1 051l 8s 6d for the quarter ending in Midsummer and 1 051l 1s 6d for the quarter ending at Michaelmas making a total of 2 102l 10s —I paid it on the 26th of September for the convenience of the parish—I took receipts of the prisoner on each occasion—these are the three receipts JAMES JOHN MILLS re-examined These are the cheques signed by the directors of the paving-board looking at them —I paid then MR LEES These are the cheques I gave the prisoner Cross-examined Q Was it at your suggestion that the prisoner received this money before it was actually due to the Company A It was for the convenience of the Committee that they might make up their accounts—I believe I might suggest it MR BURLS re-examined If he had received on the 26th of September a sum not due till the 29th it was his duty to account for it within the week THOMAS HERDSFIELD I am a City officer I took the prisoner on Thursday the 4th of December in Bridge-street Blackfriars—I found some papers on him—I took him to Giltspur-street Compter and on the 10th after he was committed as I was taking him to Newgate he asked me if I thought he should be as comfortable there as he had been at Giltspur-street—I told him I thought he would—he said I shall give no trouble I intend to plead guilty —I believe that was all he said except desiring me to call for his coat and bundle Cross-examined Q Have you related all that you stated to this gentleman before A I think I have—I do not know of any thing more— I did not mention any specific sum that he was charged with taking The receipts were here put in and read Prisoner s Defence The accounts of the Company had got into such an intricate state for some years past that I must throw myself

and receive any sums of money—I sent him to Mrs Brent s at Dept-ford for 1l 16s and if he received it it was his duty to pay it to me—he has not paid it me nor any part of it—he returned and stated that Mrs Brent was ill and she had nothing but a very large note in the house and had not change to pay it but she would send in a very few days Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When was this A On the 14th of November—he continued in my service six or seven days afterwards—he had been with me six weeks or two months before—I know a person named Basan—he had a shipment about that time—I provided some bottles for that shipment—I received a turn of money on account—Mr Bassan sent in some bottles himself and I provided the rest—it was a shipment of ale and porter—it was seized because there was an information that some of it had been put into old bottles which cannot receive the draw-back—it was Mr Basan s first shipment—he employed me to bottle the ale—Tindell did it under my superintendence—I received twenty-three gross of new bottles from Mr Basan and I had the money to buy the remaining two gross of new bottles—the ale is now in the cellar—I received the money before any bottles were bought—the reason all the ale was not in new bottles was that part of it was bottled before the new bottles were sent in—I knew it ought to have been in new bottles and I bought a gross of bottles myself and therefore there could be but one gross of old but the thing was settled with the Excise-office ten days ago which was seven days before I knew the prisoner was in custody Q Is it usual to give any entertainment to the men A It is usual in packing to give the packing officers their lunch—that was about the time the prisoner was sent to Deptford—I know nothing about the prisoner paying for an entertainment for the officers I paid for their lunch every day—I heard of my wife s son taking a bottle of wine—it was returned the next day—it was Mr Basan s wine—Tindell told me of it but I look upon him in that transaction as guilty as the other I do not prosecute the prisoner for that but for taking this money—I did not send any of Mr Basan s bottles to other people s houses instead of putting his ale into them and if such a thing was done it was without my knowledge—I heard that Thomas and the officers and the prisoner had been carousing together—Clancey told me of it—I did not know that he had been one of the party—he did not say he had rather pay the money than I should indict the prisoner—he condemned the prisoner all through—when we are bottling there is always an Excise-officer and it is customary to give them their lunch ALFRED BRENT I am the ton of Mrs Brent of Deptford I was at home on the 14th of November the principal part of the day—the prisoner came for the payment of a bill for two gallons of British brandy which came to 1l 16s —my mother was ill in bed—my sister paid him in my presence and he gave this receipt signed For John James Bowring William Tindell —Mr Bowring afterwards called for the money and we showed him the receipt Cross-examined Q You say your mother was ill perhaps she had a large note A Not that I know of—she might have one—my sister paid him two sovereigns in my presence and to the best of my knowledge I gave the prisoner a pen and ink to write the receipt—I believe I saw him write it—I took it up directly after—I am sure this is the same paper Prisoner s Defence I have no doubt this case would not have been urged against me but for my being as evidence against other parties—he has sworn he was not aware that the ale was in old bottles and he knows that old bottles were used and in consequence of that I have no doubt this indictment is laid against me which I was not aware of till last night—the whole sum of money was spent in a supper as he had promised to give a leg of mutton supper and to stand a few bottles of wine provided the job was hushed up—he came home that night in a great passion and accused Clancey of laying an indictment and I took the officer to the ticket-porters public-house to have a glass of brandy-and-water Clancey and Thomas came to us and we had ale and porter and three glasses of brandy-and-water to prevent any thing going forward against him—the officers then wanted supper and we went to Shoreditch and bought 8lbs of tripe at Mr Bennett s and some onions and we went to a house to have them—I was in liquor and west to bed and they had the tripe and the onions cooked—I had the whole money taken from me sad since then Clancey has said he would pay the money by instalments rather than I should be indicted—Mr Bowring has more than once pressed me to join him in partnership knowing that my friends were respectable and would support him—I can produce an sight-years character and never was in any difficulty before and it is no doubt to prevent my appearing against him that he has instituted this JOHN JAMES BOWRING re-examined Q Did you authorize him to have any leg of mutton supper and to hush up matters with the officers A No not in any way the supper was—the same evening that he came home but when he came in in the afternoon I asked him for the money before the supper and about six days afterwards I was saying I thought it was a very extraordinary thing that Mrs Brent did not send the money as she was a lady who never required to be asked a second time—I then went out and when I returned the prisoner said there had been a messenger from Mrs Brent and she would send the next day—in a day or two afterwards I said I would go there myself—the prisoner then left and I saw him no more MR PAYNE Q Are you quite sure that you asked him for the money the same day as he received it A Yes it was not the next day that I spoke to him about it—I will swear I did not give him authority in any way to do the best he could to prevent ray getting into any dilemma respecting these bottles—they could not get me into any scrape—they might Mr Basan I was not in the slightest degree amenable to the Excise Witness for the Defence ROBERT CLANCEY I remember the dispute with the officer—I do not know when it was but we had the tripe supper the same night—I did not have any brandy-and-water—the prisoner was the worse for drink—the officer said it must be the prisoner or I who had laid the information—he and the prisoner went away together—the prisoner tried to pacify the officer—I had some supper with them—it was tripe—I believe the officer paid for it—the prisoner was there—I cannot tell where it was but it was Hox-ton way—I cannot tell at what time the prisoner went to bed Prisoner You are aware that Mr Bowring told us to settle it as well as we could Witness No I cannot say any thing about that—I am only a common working man Joshua Holtham a trunk-maker Charles Thomas and Edward Hollo-way basket-maker at Hammersmith gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 21 — Transported for Seven Years See page

Charles-street Hatton-garden The prisoner was in my employ some years off and on—about March last I was attacked with illness and was not able to attend to my business—it was the prisoner s duty to serve customers in my shop and receive the money and account for it—when I was ill it was him duty to account to Mrs Staight and to enter such sums—here is the cash-book—he has not accounted for 1l 16s 6d on the 10th of March as received from Mr Balls nor for 17s 4d from Mr Vincent on the 9th of April not for 1l 18s from Mr Vincent on the 18th—there are no such entries—the entries in this book are his writing Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did you never receive money from him without its being in the book A When I have been in the shop but I begged him to enter every thing he sold in the shop and these things are not entered—my wife did not receive money from different people—she was chiefly in the country waiting on me—Mr Vincent was not in my employment—I have entrusted him with things to sell—he has not acted as a person employed by me—this is the book in which the accounts ought to be entered of what the prisoner sold in the shop—there are no entries of monies received since the 20th of May—I know Mr Simmonds by coming for work to my shop I asked her if she had paid the prisoner 3s she said she had but afterwards she said she had not—I have never asked Herbert Edkins to go out with Vincent and not lose sight of him for fear he should rob me—I certainly have got an open account with Vincent and he is at this time indebted to me—I have entrusted him with goods to sell—he has returned what he has not sold and he money for the others but he has not always done that—I keep no stock book—I do not Know that I ever did take stock—when I was ill money has been brought on Saturday night to my country night to my country-house at Hornsey—it has been paid to my wife—I have not received monies on Saturday night which I know was not entered—I had no other servant who received money and did set enter it—it was not the practice to bring the book to me—I did not receive money from the prisoner and I myself enter it in the book afterwards—the prisoner ought to enter every thing he received in that book MR CLARKSON Q It was the duty of the prisoner to enter in this book the amounts of those monies he received over the counter A Yes when I was ill it was his duty to account to my wife and when she came to me she brought down money sometimes—he has never entered these monies nor told me he had received them nor paid them to me MARY STAIGHT I am the prosecutor s wife In March and April my husband was ill at Hornsey—the prisoner was employed to receive monies over the counter and this book is kept to enter the read money accounts—it was his duty to enter an account of every thing he received—he has not accounted to me for 1s 16s 6d received from Mr Balls on the 10th of March nor for the two sums received from Mr Vincent Cross-examined Q Were you always in town A No I came up about twice a-week—money was not brought down on Saturday—Barnes came down sometimes once a-week—he would sometimes bring down four or five sovereigns—and when I came to town on the Saturday we settled the accounts—I never received one shilling from him but what was entered in that book—I never booked any thing myself—I have never revived money and not struck it out of the book—I do not remember Mr William Simmonds being applied to for an account and saying he said it to me—only one half-sovereign that was the day before yesterday—no monies were ever paid to me between the 10th of March and the 18th of April—and no monies were ever paid to me without the book being produced and it appearing that they were entered—Barnes did not bring the book when he brought the four or five sovereigns—I swear that when I went to town the accounts were gone through once a week and the monies settled with what was in the book MR CLARKSON Q Were you charged at the office with having prosecuted this man to keep him away from being a witness against your husband A Yes WILLIAM VINCENT I was a customer of Mr Staight s and am an Ivory dealer and have sold things for Mr Staight on commission—there is an account between us now—he never charged me with having robbed him—on the 9th of April I paid 17s 4d to the prisoner on account of his master for ivory leaves and on the 18th of April 1l 18s for goods—these are the bills I had from the prisoner and the receipts he gave Cross-examined Q Have you been employed by Mr Staight to sell goods on his account and receive money A No I have not acted as his servant—when I had ivory of him I had a bill from him—I took money for myself not for him—I do owe him some money now—he has never charged me with robbing him—I swear that these receipts are the prisoner s hand-writing—a man of the name of Herbert Edkins has been sent to carry ivory leaves for me—he was in Mr Staight s employ and he went about with me when selling my own goods—I mean that I have bought goods of Mr Staight and he has sent his man about with me to see how I disposed of them—I was not employed by Mr Staight to sell them THOMAS BALLS I was in the habit of dealing with Mr Staight On the 10th of March I purchased goods to the amount of 1l 16s 9d which I paid the prisoner—he gave me this receipt on the bill Cross-examined Q Where was the prisoner A In Mr Staight s parlour—I and Mr Barnes were there Prisoner s Defence I have worked for my prosecutor very nearly eleven years I have left him two or three times and he charges me with embezzlement—I think he has done it as I was subpœnaed on a trial against him—he wanted me to speak against the man I was subpœnaed by—I told him I would speak the truth—on that account I spoke to Mr Vincent and I said I hoped the right party would gain it meaning the other man as I considered he was in the right—he told Mr Staight of it and when he found I would still speak the truth he behaved to me in a very shabby manner—treated me with silence and contempt altogether—on the Saturday night I said I should like to know what it is I have done to offend you you have treated me in such a manner that it is impossible for me to stop —he said You have spoken against me you have said this and that and the other —I said Bring the people forwards but being Saturday night it was too late then—and he spoke about an account in 1835 which was money received by me for men s wages and money I had borrowed of him—on the Monday I went away to finish two or three pounce-boxes which I had to do—he came to town and sent for me and said Why did you not finish the knives —I said I could not find them—I then did the knives and said I would go home and finish the pounce-boxes and bring them and settle my account with him—he said he would not settle it without I gave him a copy of my book—I did—he said it was of on service and went up to Hatton-garden so compel me to deliver up the book which I had in my possession and the next day he took out this warrant—and I can declare I delivered every farthing I received to him or his wife—he had a friend to be in the shop and about the place on purpose to see what customers came in while he was ill—I believe I can prove that there was an account between Mr Vincent and Staight which was never settles—and Mr Staight said Do not leave Vincent in the shop one moment without some one is there —if I had occasion to go out Mr Staight s son was there and Mr Balls had an account with Mr Staight—and when he came for what he had he said Do not inter that for I am going to pay for it —hid account was always entered in the large book and not in thin small one—and you will find his account there every farthing I received for Mr Staight—so help me God I have paid him RICHARD BAYLISS I took the prisoner he came and gave himself up to me voluntarily—my brother officer had been after him COURT to DANIEL STAIGHT Q Did you ever ask the prisoner to speak against the person who subpœnaed him for a witness A No—he went away of his own accord—that after no quarrel of dispute MR CLARKSON Q Before he left you did you speak to him about making up his accounts A Yes I could not get him to bring them—he said he would go home and make them up and come the following day—he came the next day without them Prisoner That account has nothing to do with this account WILLIAM HERBERT WELLS I am an ivory-turner I was once in the employ of Mr Staight—I have known the prisoner three years or three years had a half—I never knew any thing amiss of him—I am acquainted with Mr Staight s mode of keeping accounts—I used to keep them partially myself been paid or not—I left three years and a half ago—but I have been there since from a year and a half to two years MR CLARKSON Q Were you discharged from Mr Staight for misconduct A No I left him of my own accord and was obliged to summon him for a balance due to me WILLIAM SIMMONDS I have had dealings with Mr Staight for service years I know of mistakes in his accounts—that was proved last Wednesday because he had got an account against me which Mrs Staight had received the money for and my wife can prove it—I have been there repeatedly and paid money to the prisoner which has been paid to Mr Staight and not entered in any book HEREBRT EDKINS I was in the employ of Mr Staight I used to go about with Mr Vincent by Mr Staight s direction to keep a sharp look out upon him that he did not sell any leaves and not return the money—I was discharged by Mr Staight in January last Mr Pike

t18361128-104  104 WILLIAM HENRY DOUGALL was indicted for embezzlement MR PRENDERGAST conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM HARRIS I am a solicitor and live in Stone-buildings The prisoner was my clerk—I am agent to Mr Bishop of Exeter—the prisoner was authorized to receive money due to me or Mr Bishop and pay it to me at the time or else the same evening and to send to me at the same time an account of all business done and a part of that would be the money he had received and paid—he had a general authority for receiving money—on the 16th of March he gave me no account of the sum of 2l 1s 7d —nor did he mention the transaction—on the 2nd of August he gave me no account of any sums of money received from Messrs Clark and Metcalf—nor any account of 3l 16s —or 4l 0s 6d received of them on Mr Bishop s account—I discharged him on the 2nd of November this year—up to that time he had made no statement at all of these sums—I knew nothing about the receipt of them at that time—I have an account of them in the prisoner s hand-writing given to me since—neither of these three sums have ever been paid me—I am the general agent of Mr Bishop—I transact all his business—I receive money for him and pay it—this paper was given me by Mr Homerton who recommended the prisoner to me as clerk—and there I find the prisoner had received several other sums independent of these—Mr Force was a clerk to Mr Bishop and he had been a clerk to me in January last—he was employed as my clerk to collect accounts due to Mr Bishop—the prisoner had no authority to receive these sums of money from any one but me—Mr Bishop delivered me a book which contains these sums authorizing me to receive them—I had the list from him—there were two sums of Clerk and Metcalf of 3l 16s and 4l 0s 6d —they were due to Mr Bishop—the prisoner had access to that book which was delivered to me by Mr Bishop himself JURY Q Did the prisoner render you an account of money received in May and August A Yes and that account was checked every night by myself and the balance paid over to me whatever it was—the items in this indictment were never brought to account Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Then Mr Force had no authority from Mr Bishop to receive money he was merely your clerk A No except that Mr Bishop said As Force is here I hope you will let him have a couple of hours a day to receive them —Force is no here—he had no authority to collect for Mr Bishop on his own account—I should not have allowed it—Mr Moon is a clerk of mine still—he told me he was subpœnaed and of course I told him to come—on the 2nd of November I discharged the prisoner because I found that he had received 20l of a client—I did not tell him to come on the Saturday—he said he would come and I acquiesced in it—I had no objection—this list was sent in before I discovered the deficiency in this indictment—on the evening of the day after he left me or on the 4th I am not sure the 2nd was on Wednesday—I believe it was sent in before the Saturday on which he was to call—he did not call—I never saw him till he was apprehended—I took a receipt for the salary I would him on the 2nd that was 1l 2s 6d but did not pay him—I desired him to give me the receipt that I might retain it on account of 2l I had lent him some time before and part of which was due to me and as he left me on the Tuesday I thought it was better to take as acknowledgment from him—the receipt was for the wages—I did not owe him any wages they were due on the Saturday and leaving me as he did I considered he was not entitled to any—this is the receipt—1l 2s 6d was the salary for that week—I owned him no money on the 2nd of November—I never told him I would not prosecute—Mr Force did not act as authorized by Mr Bishop to receive his money—he is living at Exeter—Moon sat in the same room as the prisoner—Force never received accounts for Mr Bishop which he was not obliged to account to me for—I never asked for any bill of exchange of the prisoner nor authorized any body to ask it—I gave him 1l 2s 6d a week—I was under no engagement but I have occasionally given him cast-off clothes—I cannot say whether any person while Force was in the office came and paid any of Bishop s debts to Force and the prisoner—I did not allow Force any salary—he was an articled clerk—I had this book from Mr Bishop himself to receive the sums—this letter was delivered to me by him to receive the sum of 12s 9d —I had a letter to receive every sum in this book—I cannot show any authority to receive the sums mentioned in the indictment because the prisoner has taken those letters and called on the persons for the sums—I have had those letters withdrawn from my drawer to which the prisoner had access—the parties would not have paid without some authority—the prisoner never to my knowledge paid any sums of money collected by him to Force for Bishop when Force was in the office—Force left in January last—this letter is an authority—there is no signature to it but he had so many to collect reads Sir —Above I send you the Under Sheriff s charges which I will thank you to pay to Mr William Harris 5 Stone-buildings Lincolns Inn as the delay in payment of these small bills occasions great inconvenience your early attention will oblige —Sir your most obedient servant —I received in each case in which I was to obtain money for Bishop a special authority from him—I have asked the clerk of Metcalf and Clark whether he had any letter corresponding with the one I put in—the prisoner paid no money to Force by my desire or to my knowledge—Force has paid me no money on account of Mr Bishop—I know he has received money for him—that was when he was in my office—he accounted to me for it but did not pay it to me MR PRENDERGAST Q When was this book given to you by Bishop A Some time at the latter end of January—I believe most of these items are Force s—this was put into my hands by Bishop—since that no other person has received authority to receive sums for Bishop but myself—when I receive a debt I go with this in my hand to show I am the regular agent of Mr Bishop—I show no authority—I have a general authority COURT Q You say Mr Bishop placed in your hands this book and these letters A Yes with an understanding to receive them and an pursuance of that I have from time to time received or collected these sums by my clerks—if a person came to pay a sum of money I should receive it without a particular authority—Force left me about the end of January the book I think is in the hand-writing of Force and part of this letter I think is Mr Bishop s—the writing looks like it SAMUEL CULVERWELL I am a clerk in the office of the legacy duty I paid the sum of 2l 1s 7d on account of Mr Bishop to a clerk in Mr Harris s office—he gave me a receipt which I have in my hand—I paid it to the person who wrote it—I received general dierections in a letter from Mr Bishop to pay it to Mr Harris which I did on the 16th of March COURT Q By paying Mr Harris s clerk did you intend to pay Harris on account of Bishop A I did and it was signed by the person I paid it to WILLIAM HARRIS This is the prisoner s hand-writing reads Received the above charge for Mr W R Bishop 17th of March 1836 for Mr Harris JOHN HENRY WRIGHT I am clerk to Messrs Clark and Metcalf solicitors of Lincoln s Inn-fields The prisoner came on the 6th of July—to the best of my recollection that was his first application—he called for two sums 4l 0s 6d and 3l 16s due to Mr Bishop of Exeter—he said he applied for Mr Harris of Stone-buildings—I did not pay him on that day as I had no instructions—he called two or three times between that and the 2nd of August—on the 2nd of August I paid the money to the prisoner—for both sums—I have his receipts written in my presence by him—I know his person Cross-examined Q Were these words Mr Harris 5 Stone-buildings on the paper when he put his name to it A They were—last November twelvemonth that account was handed to me by Mr Force—I had no orders to pay him—Force stated he was then staying at Mr Harris s Stone-building and I put the name in the corner to refresh my memory MR PHILLIPS to WILLIAM HARRIS Q Whose hand-writing is this A Mr Bishop s reads Above I send you my charges which I will thank you to pay to Mr Edwin Force the bearer hereof For your obedient servant W R Bishop MR WRIGHT re-examined This was first presented in the month of November 1835 and I did not like to pay till I wrote to our clients—we did not question the charge we only wanted our clients authority to pay it—I put Mr Harris Stone-buildings on it when it was delivered—we were to pay it to Mr Force while he was in town but we afterwards paid it to the prisoner COURT Q In consequence of your clients letter was you prepared to pay Harris A Yes—these accounts were due from Clark and Metcalf to Bishop as agents for Mr Coleman of Birmingham an attorney and in consequence of the letter I received I was prepared to pay Harris the money considering him the agent of Bishop WILLIAM HARRIS Mr Force was my regular articled clerk by regular articles from Mr Bishop MR PHILLIPS addressed the jury stating that the prisoner had received these sums as the agent of Mr Force who was the agent of Mr Bishop WILLIAM MOON I am clerk to the prosecutor I remember Mr Force coming to town the beginning of October 1835—he brought some bills—they were items of debts due to Mr Bishop—I recollect his giving them to the prisoner about the time when he first came there—he told the prisoner to collect the money for him as he did not know any thing about town—he was to allow him one per cent—I am not aware that I heard him say that but he did allow it him—I myself never received any of these debts—on Force s leaving town the prisoner accounted to him for money he had received and I believe he pad him 10s for what he had received—he collected about 50l —on Force s leaving town he made up the books—I often saw the prisoner pay Force money—nothing was said that I recollect but I know the money had been received by him COURT Q Force made up his book and you afterwards saw the prisoner pay Force money and took it for granted it was on account of Bishop A Yes MR PRENDERGAST Q When did Force leave town A On the 22nd of January—I do not know of the prisoner or Force acting as agents from that time—I have seen Mr Bishop in our office—Mr Harris acts as his agent—this book was in Mr Harris s possession lately—Force had a book something like this but I do not know whether it is this—it was kept in Mr Harris s drawer—I have seen it there four months and more—it was kept there in August I think MR PHILLIPS Q Do you remember Force coming to town since August A Yes I have seen them together—I heard nothing about Mr January last—I have seen them together—I heard nothing about Mr Bishop MR PRENDERGAST Q Did you make a copy of that book by Mr Harris s order A Yes nearly five months ago—it was then in his possession—the copy I made was then given to Bishop Mr Sweet a pork-butcher Upper-marsh Lambeth James Buckley tailor Great Waterloo-street William Church Salmon coppersmith Waterloo-road Mr Wall engineer Waterloo-road and Matthew Hawthorn a publican of Russell-court gave the prisoner a good character Prisoner Mr Harris suspecting I received these sums stopped my wages and he has an I O U for money borrowed of him—you will see I paid 1l 9s out of it and he stopped the receipt of my salary thinking I had taken these two sums and he likewise said if I had received them if I would get my friends to come forward and make up the money I was welcome to do it—Mr Harris never received a sixpence of the money that Force received nor of the sums in that book—Mr Force gave me instructions to receive them GUILTY Aged 23 —Recommended to mercy by the Jury Transported for Seven Years

St Paul Covent-garden another set of COUNTS stating him to be a clerk and other COUNTS stating the monies to have come into his possession as the servant of William Walker and others MESSRS PHILLIPS and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JAMES CORDER I am clerk to the guardians of the Strand Union From the year 1828 to 1836 I was vestry clerk of St Paul s Coventgarden—there are in that parish several parochial rates collected—poor s rate church rate improvement rate and under another Act of Parliament a rector s rate—the rector s rate is raised under 51 Geo 3 c 150 s 2 —tne prisoner was appointed collector of those rates—I have his appointment in the vestry book—he was elected by poll—I was vestry clerk at the time and was present at the election—he was appointed collector of the poor church and improvement rates on the 13th of June 1829 for one year—the original appointment did not refer to the period of a year but it is the custom to renew the appointment annually and this appointment was renewed annually down to 1835—during my time he acted as collector of those rates— the witness here read the minute of vestry declaring the Prisoner to be elected collector of the parochial rates —he was paid a pound age on the money he collected—1 per cent which was afterwards altered to 1 1/4 —he was supplied with receipt books to give receipts to rate-payers—when a new rate was made he used to go to the printer s and order the books—there was a form of receipt and in the margin particulars were printed to contain an abstract of the contents of the receipt he used—this other book was presented to the sub-committee of accounts every fortnight and represented as a correct account of what he had received during the subsequent fortnight—there was a separate account book for each rate in the course of collection—this book is the account he produced and it was checked with the margins of the receipts which he produced at the same time—on the 27th of October 1834 I find he charges himself with receiving the sum of 3l 2s from Mr Evans that is for one quarter s poor rate 2l 2s 7 1/2 d a quarter s church rate 2s 7d one quarter s improvement rate 11s 7 1/2 d and one

quarter 13s 6d rector s rate one quarter 6s —the rector s rate is made by the churchwardens for the time being Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Was the renewal of his appointment confirmed by vote of vestry A Yes—we appoint in March—the resolution in 1834 is this Resolved that Mr John Callahan be re elected collector of the parish rates and that he do receive a commission 1 1/4 per cent on the amount of his collection —the committee of management are elected by the same authority but not always at the same time—the prisoner is a very old parishioner—he has made great exertions in the affairs of the vestry—he took the lead in all parish business—he was brass-founder and gas fitter in Exeter-street—he was universally respected by all parties in the parish and I believe the parish at large had the highest opinion of his honesty and integrity Q Is it within your knowledge that some time previous to this he had been very much disappointed in a sale of some property to Government A I believe he received a smaller sum than he expected by some hundreds I only know it from what he told me—he accounted to a sub-committee of the Committee of Management for the four rates received—the Committee of Management appointed the sub-committee and they examined his accounts—we took a great deal of pains to discover him—a reward of 50l was offered by advertisement—I do not know of my own knowledge how much has been recovered from his sureties but I believe 500l —I have ceased to be vestry clerk—the sureties ought to have been solvent persons to the amount of 2000l but only two parties have been threatened to be used and 300l was taken from one and 200l from the other—one surety is a bankrupt and the other died some three or four years since while I was in office—there ought to have been new ones appointed—there was no other mode of his accounting to the sub-committee except that the sum total which he reported to them as having been received always corresponded with his payment—he has several children—he has been in a bad state of health and is I believe about sixty years old—he has not been called to any other mode of accounting except that he gave to the sub-committee MR BODKIN Q After the sub-committee examined his statement did he appear before the committee themselves A Yes—he attended their meetings—his account to the sub-committee would be reported to the com mittee of management and read by myself—the total amount of his deficiency I believe is about 1500l or 1600l THOMAS EVANS I am a rate-payer of St Paul Covent-garden and was so in

August in consequence of information which reached me I took the prisoner into custody—he was living in Scotland-road Liverpool going by the name of John Carter—I asked him if his name was Callahan—he said it was not—I asked if he knew the neighbourhood of Covent garden London—he said he did not that he came from Poole—I had a copy of the Hue and Cry in my pocket at the time—it contained an advertisement respecting him—I read it to him—he said he knew nothing of it—I took this book from a chest the key of which I found on him—I took him in charge and brought him to London Cross-examined Q What was the date of the Hue and Cry A December 1835 THOMAS MOSELEY I am now vestry-clerk of St Paul Covent Garden I know the prisoner—a message was delivered to me since he was apprehended in consequence of which I went and saw him—I told him any thing he said must be voluntary and that it was possible I might have to give it in evidence afterwards but I would not do it unless I was obliged—I believe the book produced to be in his handwriting—I have seen him write repeatedly—he said he had sent the book to me as an erroneous impression was abroad about the amount he had taken away—he said he had seen in one of the papers that it was as much as 2000l —he said it was not so much—he did not think it was 1500l —he said that in coming from America he had drawn out a statement of what he took away but as they bad watched him very much he had thrown it overboard but he had a book in his trunk which he understood the officer had taken away that pointed out pretty clearly the amount of which he was deficient—I have added up the amount in this book and it is very nearly 1800l —among other entries are T Evans 3l 2s Brown and Kay 2l 17s and Stannard 3l 12s Cross-examined Q How long have you been vestry-clerk A I was elected last May twelvemonth MR PHILLIPS Q Do you know Henry Walker A Yes—he is an inhabitant and was churchwarden in 1834—there were other church wardens

t18380820-1793  1793 WILLIAM SHAW was again indicted for embezzlement MESSRS PHILLIFS and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution GEORGE VINCENT The prisoner was in my service in January this year-down to June last year he kept a cash book in the office-in consequence of a discovery I then made a fresh arrangement with respect to the money in the office—I then forbade him to receive money but if money was left in my absence it was to be placed in an iron box which I bought for the purpose—he did not account to me for 4l 0s 10d received from Mr Biggs of Southampton-buildings—he did not inform me that he had received that sum Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q I take it for granted you return the answer you did before to the question that you expressly for bade him to receive money on any pretence whatever A Yes those were my words—the first time I heard of this 4l 0s 10d being received at all must have been in February-an articled clerk of the name of Heath brought me the intelligence of it—he stated it as a communication derived from the prisoner—the prisoner was in my office in June and was arrested in February-in the interval between January and February I was very much engaged in the case of Cain in this Court—one entire week all day long I had to examine the witnesses-when the prisoner had been arrested and discharged he came to my office and I refused to see him—I was witting on enter into any explanation with a second person but not with him—I bade the clerks or anybody in the office to speak to him about a fortnight afterwards as I found they were in communication with him—I have to recollection of a witness named Williams being examined At the examiner s in Chancery in the case of Wilder and another EDWARD ALLEN EAGLE I am clerk to Mr Biggs of Southampton—I know the prisoner—I saw him on the 20th of January last at the prosecutor s office in Paper-buildings Temple and paid him 4l 0s 10d on account of Mr Biggs for Mr North of Wellington—I paid it for Mr Vincent I have a receipt for it—it was signed by the prisoner in my presence— read— 20th Jan 1838 Received the above for Blacklock and Co WILLIAM SHAW £4 0s 10d —the bill was headed Wm North Messrs Blacklock Bunce Vincent and Sherwood —I laid the money a table before him and it remained there a few minutes before he took up—he did take it up finally Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You remained there two or three minutes with him talking I suppose A Yes—he took up the money before I went away—I did not take Messrs Blacklock Bunce Vincent and Sherwood to be partners—I paid it on account of Mr Vincent—I understood Mr Blacklock to be dead—I do not know whether Mr Sherwood a partner or not—I was directed to pay this to the clerk for Mr Vincent—I was directed to pay it to Shaw for Mr Vincent by Mr Biggs the chancery clerk EDWARD LEWIS MAYOR I am seventeen years of age and am an artided clerk—this bill is my hand-writing—I made it out by the prisoner s directions—he told me to go to Mr Bigg s chambers and get the money ir it—I went—he asked me what person I saw—I said I saw a person in room by himself—that it was a very dirty place and that lie said he would all next morning and pay it Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Do you know how long the bill had been delivered A I delivered it myself—I do not know that it had been sent before—there were four clerks in the Chancery-office at that come—one left before I delivered the bill—I believe three remained besides the prisoner—I cannot say whether they were all present when he sent me for this money—I believe it was done openly in the officer—there was no appearence of secrecy about it but of course I did not understand having seen in the office but a short time-if they had paid me the money I should have received it and given it to Mr Shaw—I cannot say where Mr Vincent was at that time—he was not in the office—the man came with the money the morning after I went to Mr Biggs the last time—I saw the money paid and the prisoner gave the receipt—I remember very little about the prosecution of Cain—I am articled to Mr Thomas Sherwood—he comes to the office now and then and gives orders—he has not a room to himself—he sits in Mr Vincent s office—he does not do a great deal there—he comes now and then and stops an hour or so—he comes into the office sometimes and tells us different things-orders us what to do about things-if he orders me to do any thing I obey him and the other clerks obey him as far as I know Q Had you any reason to suppose he was not your master as well as Mr Vincent A Not the least—Mr Bunce comes too—he comes into the office but never acts in the capacity of master—he taxes bills in Mr Vincent s office COURT Q Before this time did you ever make out a bill A I only copied different things—I had not made out a bill before this time that I know of—I copied this one from a draft JOHN MASCALL HEATH I am clerk to Mr Vincent I remember Mr Shaw in the office—he left about the 10th of February—after he had left some short time I happened to meet him in Chancery-lane—he told me he had received it he sum of 4l 0s 10d from Mr Biggs of Southampton buildings and he told me if Mr Vincent found it out and asked me about it I was to say that I had got the money—he also said he did not care about Mr Vincent knowing about any thing more in the office—I said if you will send the money down to-morrow morning I will tell Mr Vincent that you have handed me the money and I will tell him that you received it when you were in the office —that would have been the fact—I told Mr Vincent of this afterwards Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When did you tell him of it A A day or two afterwards—it was a voluntary statement of my own—it was about ten days or a fortnight after the prisoner left the office and a fortnight or three weeks before the fire—I cannot say that I saw Mr George Shaw at Mr Vincent s office after that—I know Mr westmacott—I saw him at the office after that and before the fire—I did not know that Mr Vincent had refused to see the prisoner or hear from him any ex-planation—Mr Thomas Sherwood was not in the habit of attending the office at that time—he never attended to the business of the office—he used to come there sometimes—he used to drop in once or twice a week—he has been there twice a day—he was not in the habit of coming every day—he never was in the habit of coming to attend to business—I cannot say how often I have seen him there in a week—I never counted—I was in the habit of seeing Mr Bunce there-when he was attending at the master s office he used to come there every day—he was not in the habit of signing letters in the office-never in the name of the firm—he never signed letters except his own private letters—he was not in the habit of seeing clients except his own private clients—I mean they were people who had been his own clients when he was in the business they would say I want to see Mr Bunce and then he saw them—Mr Sherwood was never in the habit of signing letters—I never remember his signing a letter—I will swear he never signed one in my presence or that I afterwards saw—I am articled to Mr Vincent-in January last Mr Vincent was engaged defending a person named Cain indicted for man-slaughter—the first time the prisoner told me of the receipt of this 4l 0s 10 d was when I met him Q Pray did you make an entry in the books in the office of the payment of one guinea or 1l to Mr Williams a witness in the cause of Wilder and Watson A Yes that cause had been in the office about three years—it was one in which the Chancery clerks in the office were principally engaged—Mr Vincent superintended the business generally—we used to enter the disbursements in the disbursement-book and the name of the cause in which the money was paid—Mr Vincent used to post it up himself-among other causes was that of Wilder and Watson—I know Mr Williams and knew the guinea had been paid to him—I paid it myself out of the office money—there were two sums I believe paid to him of a guinea each—I did not pay both—the prisoner paid the other believe—he stated to me that he did Q Did not he tell you when he mentioned the 4l 0s 10d that he had borrowed 1l of that sum to pay Mr Williams A No he did not—he told me when he was in the lock-up-house that he had paid Mr Williams the guinea—I went to see him in the lock-up-house—that guinea was entered in my master s books as paid to Mr Williams—Mr Vincent had not the opportunity of seeing whether it had been paid or not because the books were burnt and Mr Williams was not in the office—he is living but Mr Vincent does not go to a person to whom we make payments and ask him whether the money is paid Q On the 22nd of January do you remember whether Mr Vincent was engaged in defending Cain A I do not know the date—I know he did defend Cain—the prisoner used to carry on the Bankruptcy business as well as the Chancery—he did not superintend the whole business—he superintended the Common Law—he was active in all the rest of the business—we had Very little conveyancing but what there was he attended to—he was a good deal occupied—he used to come in between ten and eleven o clock—I have seen him there at half-past nine o clock—I never saw him before that-be used not to stay late—Mr Vincent used to go away between five and six o clock—Mr Vincent was engaged several days in the case of Cain—I believe he came to hear the judgment on him on the 5th of February but be never told me so—I do not remember his going out of town that evening saying he should return on Tuesday—he did go out of town after the sentence was pronounced upon Cain—he was in the country at the time the prisoner sent notice that he was arrested—I do not know that he had resolved not to see the prisoner after his return from the country—he had not desired the clerks not to speak to him at that time—that was between a fortnight and three weeks after he was discharged from the office—I had not been in the habit of meeting the prisoner—I never saw him but at the time named a fortnight after he left—I am sure it was not within a week after he left—I saw him after that time before he was taken into custody on this charge—I saw him several times but did not speak to him—I saw him once in the Temple Q If Mr Vincent wanted to find him he was very easily apprehended A I believe he was residing at his mother s but I did not know where he was to be found—I believe he was to be found at his mother s—I did not see him at the office on the 8th of February two days after he had been arrested—he did not come to the office and take his seat at the table as usual at business—he came to the office one Saturday night the same night as he was discharged out of custody—I do not know what day of the month that was—there is an open account between myself and the prisoner—that was the subject upon which he first spoke to me when we met—he said he had an account with me which was unsettled—I explained it to him and he said I shall consider from this time that our account is quite closed and after that as we were parting he spoke to me about the 4l 0s 10d —I kept the cash account in the office—I had not an account of money some of which I received from him and some of which he received from me—I received none from him—he has received some from me of which I had an account—he did not request me to bring the 4l 0s 10d into account as he was unable to see Mr Vincent himself—he told me not to tell Mr Vincent about it—I cannot say whether I have said that before or not—the prisoner was not in the habit of transacting business on his own account in the office-nobody did so but Mr Vincent—I went into the office in 1834—he never to my knowledge did any business in the office on his own account—he never did business for his own clients in the name of the firm—I will swear I know nothing about that—there was a book kept in the office with an account of causes brought into the office by Shaw—that account was known to Mr Vincent-a page of that book contained a list of causes brought into the office by Shaw—Mr Vincent knew that—I do not know that they were called Shaw s causes—I never called them so—they were not called so—we called them by the names of the causes—I will not swear I never heard Mr Vincent call them Shaw s causes—I might have done so Q How many of those causes were there about the time he was arrested A There were Bradley and Bradley Wallis and Philpott and Lee and Shaw—I believe those were all the Chancery causes—there were some writs he brought in—there might be eight or ten since he was in the office—I cannot say how many there were when he was arrested—I am not in the Common Law office—I think there were not so many as ten or twelve—there might be eight or nine—Mr Vincent s clerks used to work them—I was not in the habit of receiving money from clients—I have received money—it was not usual for the clerks to receive money—they have done so when Mr Vincent was out of the way—I did not know of the bill of 4l 0s 10d of Mr Bigg s till after Shaw went from the office or that then had been such work done—it was before I went into the Chancery office—the prisoner was managing clerk and I was a junior—that was the only instruction I got—I had to find out what I could myself—there was nobody in the office to instruct me-before this time it had been the custom to hand in to Mr Vincent pieces of paper with sums of money received from different parties—I have done so Q Now after doing so has he forgotten it and come and asked what it was A Never to me—I have heard him come into the office and asked others what that money was—I have not heard him say he has lost the paper and forgotten all about it—I have known such a thing as bills sent down to clients and they have written up to say the money had been paid—I never heard from Mr Vincent that he had received it and forgotten it—I never read an answer to that effect—I am not aware that the prisoner had any opportunity of accounting to Mr Vincent or giving any explanation after he had been arrested MR PHILLIPS Q What time was he arrested A Somewhere about the 5th or 6th of February-from the 20th of January when the money was paid Mr Vincent was in the habit of daily attending at the office until two days before the prisoner was apprehended when he went out of town—he was attending there at least for twelve days—that was known to all the clerks and to the prisoner among the rest MR ADOLPHUS to MR VINCENT Q I believe when the prisoner was apprehended he applied for a habeas A He did and I showed cause against the motion—I did not oppose the bail—I opposed the grant on account of insinuations

t18381126-263  263 GEORGE SANGLIER was indicted for embezzlement MESSRS PHILLIPS and CHAMBERS conducted the Prosecution H W PARKER ESQ I am Assistant Secretary to the Poor Law Commissioners of Lambeth This is their seal— producing a paper —this document places the parish under a Board of Guardians—I have the confirmation of the prisoner s appointment as master of the workhouse on the 26th of June last—it is signed by me as their Assistant Secretary Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q This is the constitution drawn up under a particular Act of Parliament A Yes under that Act the guardians of the poor have to appoint the master of the workhouse WILLIAM PIGGOTT I am an army clothier at No 12 Old Jewry For a considerable time I have sent out shirts to be made by the paupers at Lambeth workhouse—the guardians of the parish are responsible to me for the return of my property—Jackson collects the money for the guardians—on the 26th of July I paid him 6l 0s 3d for Mr Sanglier the master—I paid him according to these receipts— looking at them —on the 14th of August I paid him 3l 5s —on the 24th of August 3l 5s and these are the receipts from Jackson as having the money from me Cross-examined Q Did you pay the money yourself A I did—I rather think the receipts were signed before they were brought out—I rather think he gave them to me as they were without any addition GEORGE JACKSON I am a pauper in Lambeth workhouse It was part of my business to take home linen and receive money—I received these three sums and I paid them over to Sanglier as soon as I went home—it appeared to me that he entered it in a red memorandum book but I do not know—I paid him other sums besides these—I saw him take a memorandum-book into his hand and he appeared to write Cross-examined Q Had you been in the habit of paying a great number of sums to the prisoner A Not many—perhaps not once a month at any time—I had received money from Mr Piggott three or four times while Sanglier was there—I suppose he was there three months—I have a distinct recollection that enables me to swear positively that I gave the money to him—I paid him the same day that I received them from Mr Piggott—I cannot exactly tell what I paid but by the papers on one is 3l 5s —I swear I paid that to Mr Sanglier in gold—Mr Piggott always paid me with a cheque on his banker s and I went and got it changed at his banker s—I always paid the prisoner the same day when I went home—I swear that I paid the three sums on the days here mentioned in the counting-house—no one was there—it was in the afternoon—I generally went to Mr Piggott in the morning with the goods—I have been four years in the workhouse WILLIAM THOMAS LOGAN I am clerk of the guardians of Lambeth Jackson used to receive the money for the work done by the paupers—it was his duty to hand that over to the prisoner and at the end of the quarter the prisoner was to give me an account of all sums received—he was dismissed on the 16th of October—I saw him on the 18th and asked him for his account—he rendered me an account of the money he had received amounting in the whole to 20l 18s 11d —I asked him for the particulars of it—he gave it me—one of his items was 4l 4s 6d received from Mr Piggott —I have no doubt of the receipt of it—he did not give me an account of the sum of 6l 0s 3d on the date of this receipt the 26th of July—he did not give me an account of 3l 5s nor of 3l 5s —these three dates are wholly omitted in his account—he has never accounted for these sums before or since—I asked him when he gave his account whether that was all he had received he said it was—these receipts are in his hand-writing—it would not be his duty to leave receipts in the hands of Piggott or Jackson unless he received the money Cross-examined Q How soon was he to leave A The guardians gave him two or three days—I did not perceive that he was in any confusion at having to leave so suddenly—when he gave me his detailed account he did not say he could not say whether or not it was correct—I swear he said nothing of the kind—there was no charge of this kind made before the Magistrate—no depositions were taken—the Board of Guardians appointed the prisoner—he was responsible to them—two or three members of the Board are here—the accounts should be audited every three months—they have not been audited the last six months—I had nothing to do with the appointment of the prisoner—he did not say that was the best account he could give nothing of the kind—he said he was going to live in the neighbourhood and he would look in or something to that effect—he did not say for what purpose—the parish came under the dominion of the New Poorlaw in the beginning of the year 1836—the duties of the station filled by the prisoner have increased MR PHILLIPS Q This charge was not gone into at the police-office A No he was there on another charge—we had not then found out this defalcation—it was Sanglier s duty to account to me and to me only—I am sure that these several sums were omitted—he had been suspended one week before his actual dismission—he was dismissed on the Tuesday night and I accounted with him on the Thursday—he was allowed to stay for that week in the workhouse WILLIAM PIGGOTT re-examined I paid the three sums specified—here is a receipt for 4l 4s 6d —I also paid that to Jackson on the 26th of September—that was subsequent to the other three dates—I paid that to Jackson in the same way as the others and took this receipt George Wilkinson Esq of the Northern Circuit and Recorder of Newcastle and Thomas Patterson gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 34 — Transported for Seven Years There was another indictment against the prisoner and his wife upon which no evidence was offered

t18381217-392  392 THOMAS MORGAN was indicted for embezzlement MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JAMES WILLIAM FRYER I was clerk to Bailey and Perkins They deal with Mr Taylor and had half-yearly accounts—at Christmas 1837 I think their account was 6l 13s —on the 14th of April the prisoner applied for the money and 5l 15l 6d was paid to him allowing the usual discount—he gave credit for it— reads — Creditor by cheque 5l 15s 6d —this is his writing Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Did you pay him A I firmly believe I did but I am positive he received it because on the 14th of April application was made for the account—my usual plan is to fill up all the cheques—I will not swear that I actually paid him MR BODKIN Q Did you fill up this cheque A Yes I know the prisoner s hand-writing—the cheque has been returned from the banker s as paid—I have no doubt of that writing being the prisoner s JOHN WALKER BAILEY I am in partnership with my father William Bailey—we are ironmongers in Gracechurch-street—we owed the prosecutor the quarterly account which was 11l 11s 7d —there was a discount which reduced it to 10l 14s —I have a receipt for that signed by Thomas Morgan—it has the appearance the other receipts have—I may have seen the prisoner write but I cannot charge my memory—I cannot say whether I was present when it was paid JAMES NESS I was concerned in an administration in which Mr Taylor was a creditor—in September last I sent him this letter— looking at one —I wrote the cheque for 6l 7s 1d and left it in my office—I do not know who received it I have a receipt for it—that cheque was prepared among others for the claimants—I cannot remember whether I paid this one myself—I paid eight or ten cheques and left the rest this cheque has been returned to me among other paid cheques from my banker s— looking at it Cross-examined Q Was that receipt stamped A Yes I got it from my clerk s office LAUNCELOT GROVE I was Mr Taylor s porter I went to Mr Ness s office in September last by desire of the prisoner—this is the receipt I carried there—the prisoner gave it me and desired me to go and receive the money—I went and received from Mr Ness or some of his clerks the cheque which is pinned to the receipt—I gave the cheque to Morgaa—I know no more of it—it was after dinner—Morgan was in Mr Taylor s office to the best of my knowledge Cross-examined Q When did you receive it A On the 12th of September—I know I took it to the prisoner the same day I received it—Mr Evans was there—I believe it was in the place of business—I gave the prisoner the money—I told him I had got it from Mr Ness s office—I did not receive more money that day JOSEPH TAYLOR I am in the iron business and live in Noel-street Marlborough-street The prisoner was in my employ as clerk and had been ten years and some months—it was his business to receive money on my account and keep my books—down to 1886 that was done with regularity—I paid him 2l a week—he had four rooms and firing—he is now a widower—I placed considerable confidence in him—since 1836 my books have not been kept as they used to be—he did not account to me for 5l 15s 6d received from Bailey and Perkins for their account to Christmas—I have repeatedly spoken to him about it—he said that both accounts would be paid together—he said application had been made for it—he gave me that account several times—I generally when I received money made it paid off in the ledger—I looked in the ledger in November and Bailey and Perkins s account was then left open—here is now in the book Creditor by cash Thomas Morgan —there is no date to that—I had seen the account within ten days or a fortnight of the 26th of November and it was then left open and on the 26th I saw it in this way—in Mr Bailey s account here is 11l 11s 6d —the discount would reduce it to 10l 14s —that was not paid to me—it still stands as an open account—I first saw this letter of Mr Ness s on the 27th of November—after the prisoner was remanded—it was among the papers in his possession—he had not told me before that Mr Ness had sent such a letter or given me an account of the money being received—I believe the bottom line of this receipt— looking at one —to be the prisoner s hand-writing—he was taken on the morning of the 27th of November—I had not observed him taking any papers from the counting-house—I had been out and on my return home I found a carpenter at the desk—I said to him Dyer what are you doing there —I went to make inquiries of two or three customers and had the prisoner taken Cross-examined Q How long had he been in your service A Ten years and a few months—previous to his marriage he had 30s a week—and at that time he had 40s —he was not to receive a commission for goods sold—I had sometimes thirty persons in my employ—there were about twenty when he first came—I think I have twenty-two now—my accounts are in a disordered state—I have asked him repeatedly to make up accounts which have been only headed—I knew the state the books were in—I had a letter from him on the 17th of November—he had thought proper to employ a person to do work which I did not approve of and we had a few words—after I had left business this letter was sent to me wishing me to meet him to arrange business—I did not do so—I believe he said at the police-office that if he had the books he would make them up COURT Q Was it his duty to pay you the money he received A Yes every week MR DOANE Q Did it not frequently happen that he was obliged to disburse money almost as fast as he received it in pursuance of his duty A That might be the case I have no doubt—I know he had to borrow money to pay the workmen at the end of the week and most likely he had himself money of mine in his possession—I believe he has borrowed money of Mr Hopper—I have no doubt of it—I have gone myself with him to Mr Hopper to borrow money and the prisoner had money of mine at the same time—I know that since—monies that have been lying months back—the prisoner never lent me 100l —he gave me 100l to take care of for him—I have repaid him and more—he had three £10 and £15—3000l a year might pass through his hands—I have been residing at Kensington for the last six months—he has almost commanded me as a servant to come to business—I have lately got a clerk named Mangle—I do not know whether he was clerk to Messrs Harmer and Flower—I never heard it—I have not consulted him about getting this case up—I was advised by him to go to Mr Humphreys—there was an action brought against me for dilapidations—I had above 100l to pay—the prisoner had money of a customer of mine that was owing to me to pay that—he did not get money from other parties that I am aware of—I remember being obliged to borrow 20l to pay my workmen—I know that he has paid sums of money without their being entered by him as paid and I know that he has received money which would more than cover it—I know he paid 5l 17s 6d 7l 12s 6d and 14l 6s 10d COURT Q Do you know of these sums being paid A Yes the 14l 6s 10d I paid 10l of it myself in Thames-street—he has not put that in the book as paid MR DOANE Q Do you not know of many other sums he has paid that do not appear in the book A No he has not—I know he has paid 10l to Longmore of money that has been received by him—I have known him to receive money out of which he has paid those items and that he has not put down—there is no-entry on the other side Longmore s account COURT Q Was the money he paid more than the money received by him A I should say not MR DOANE Q In this cash-book is an entry cash 35l without a name can you tell me what it refers to A That is his own writing—it is cash he received from different persons and there are items on both sides not entered—I would not swear in every case in which he received and paid money that what he paid was less than what he received—I believe I have not called upon him as lately as the coronation to pay any workmen—I remember Hyde-park fair—I did not then borrow of Mr Hopper a sum of money nor did any body to my knowledge MR BODKIN Q Does this account come down to 1836 —A Yes part of it—here he charges himself with receipts on one side and disbursements on the other—he has been frequently requested to keep up this cash-book since then—I have myself been very unwell and been obliged to live at some distance and I desired him to keep the books as he did before—he has received and paid money and has occasionally accounted to me but not in writing—he has never said that he had received these three sums but in August he said one of them was not paid—here are many accounts headed and without any entry of goods—here are headings in the day-book and the work ought to have been carried out but it is not—here is a heading in the book of the Strand Union account—there was work done for them which was begun in the the latter end of March and finished in July and there is not a particle entered of what was done for them—it was his duty to have put it down—I have no means of telling what I have to charge them Cross-examined Q Here is merely the heading for a subsequent account A Yes there were a number of men employed for about three months and application has been made by the clerk of the Union for the account which could not be furnished WILLIAM COGDELL police-constable C 66 I took the prisoner—I found some papers about him and amongst others this letter from Mr Ness— read Sir —If you will send me a receipt for your account 6l 7s 1d I will give you a cheque Your obedient

and on the Friday before about twenty minutes or half-past eight o clock in the morning—that was the usual time I went in a morning—I also went on that Monday morning and I saw the prisoner there—I asked him for half a pound of edgings—he gave me two bundles of whalebone for which I paid 1s 7d —I am sure of that—I then left the shop and went to a public-house where my husband was waiting for me—the officer came in there and took me—I had on the Saturday before given the prisoner half a dozen herrings in the street which my husband had sent him Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q I suppose you

Aldersgate-street I have one partner—the prisoner was in our empty for about three years—it was part of his duty to attend to the shop while I went to breakfast—I used to go generally at five or ten minutes after eight o clock and was away half an hour or twenty-five minutes—if the prisoner took any money during my absence it was his duty to lay it on the desk in the counting-house I found it there when I came down and he told me what it was for—for several mornings before the 4th of March when I came down he would tell me he had sold half a pound of edgings for 7d —I received information

Saturday—I saw the prisoner receive a bundle of herrings on the Saturday morning before the shop was open—I communicated this to the prosecutor WILLIAM BALLARD I am a police-officer I was stationed on Monday morning the 4th of March in a place which commanded a view of the prosecutor s shop—I saw Miller that morning at a little after seven o clock in Aldersgate-street—she went on to Barbican looked about and came back—about twenty minutes past eight o clock she went into the prosecutor s shop and came out almost immediately with some whalebone—she crossed the road went down a variety of courts into Long-lane into a public-house there and threw the whalebone on the seat—she went into the tap-room and called her husband out—he tried the whalebone in his hand and then said something about change for half a crown—the woman was then going out—Forrester took her and I took her husband—I went to the prosecutor and saw the prisoner—I asked him if he had sold any thing besides the half-pound of edgings that morning—he said he had not— I had seen Mr Smith before and directed him to put the same question to him —I then asked if he sold them to the same woman that he had before—he said Yes —I asked him if he had sold any thing else to any other person—he said No —I then said we should show that that was not true for the woman had been seen to go into the shop without any thing and she came out with some whalebone—she had been followed and taken and had had no edgings at all with her Cross-examined Q Might not that be done by a thief A It might—I should have stated that before the woman went into the shop the prisoner came to the door and stood for two or three minutes looking about him—when we took the woman we asked her where she got the whalebone from—she said From Aldersgate-street and named the-shop—I said What did you give for it —she hesitated looked at her husband and he took it up in his hand tried the weight of it and said 10s the woman then said 10s —the man then said that they had pawned a ring to get the money but I looked at the duplicate and saw it had been pawned for only 5s —I did not say any thing to frighten the woman or to terrify her to say 10s but she was frightened and a more pitiable look I never saw a person give to any one than she did to her husband—when we got to the Compter I told her she need not answer me any questions without she liked and said You were there on Thursday —she said Yes — You were there again on Friday — Yes — You were there again on Saturday — Yes — Where is the whalebone you took away — At home —her husband was not present at this time—I asked her husband about it—he said he had sent her and she said so also—he did not say that he had taken any himself JOHN FORRESTER I am an officer I took Miller s husband and afterwards went to their lodging where I found some whalebone GUILTY — Transported for Seven Years There was another indictment against the prisoner

to me for either of the sums mentioned by the two witnesses—he never gave any account of them till I found he had received them which was in consequence of information I received by a letter in January COURT Q What was his mode of accounting to you A As soon as he came home if it was in the middle of the day—I had never spoken to him about either of these sums except about two months before January I told him to go to Bailey and Jackson s and he said it would be more to my advantage to let the account go a twelvemonth than pushing it at a short time as they were beginners Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q How long have you been in business A About eleven or twelve years—the prisoner had been in my employ nearly two years—he has not been the means of adding to my business quite different—I had commenced another branch of business before he came to me but I had him to superintend that business—I had thirty or forty persons in my employ—none of them were in a superior

the prisoner and it was his duty to account to Mrs Whittingbam—my servants received about 20l a week wages—I had left funds for the payment of wages in Mrs Whittingham s hands—I think I left about 100l in her hands for wages and for payment of a bill of about 22l —I do not recollect any thing else that was to be paid—it was the prisoner s place as well as mine to keep the books and especially during the last year on account of my illness—I was a good deal confined to my bed and during that time my wife acted more than usual—I did keep the books during the year—when money is paid I bring it into another column in my ledger and in the day-book I put paid to it to save me from entering it in the ledger when there is no running account—I have not omitted to put paid or settled to an account for three months—perhaps when I have been in bed I have entered it in a memorandum-book—I remember there was a running account in the name of Piggott but I am not aware of any mistake about that—I entered that account in the cash-book—MR Jackson s was a running account—I had a conversation with the prisoner about that account MR DOANE Q Were you in Yorkshire on the 3rd of August or the 9th of November A No—after I had ascertained about these sums I said to the prisoner I want those two sums you received of Messrs Jackson —he said I have been going to speak to you about them —I said I want the money —he said I will pay you 10s a week —I said Nothing will do but the money and I walked out of the shop—he did not say he had paid it he said he would pay it—MR Wynsall was present MR BALLANTINE Q Did you keep a cash-book till this year A Not a regular cash-book—I kept a memorandum-book in which I used to enter things till I entered them in my ledger—I have not my memorandum-book here but my cash-book and my ledger—the prisoner ought to have entered these sums in the ledger and he has not JOSEPH WYNSALL I was present when the prisoner said he would pay 10s a week—I heard the whole of the conversation—the two sums of money received from Bayley and Jackson were what the prosecutor asked for—the other accounts were not known of then George Phipps a silk and worsted dealer of

t18410920-2407  2407 JOHN WENSLEY was indicted for embezzlement MR DOANE conducted the Prosecution CHRISTOPHER DANIEL HAYES JUN I am the son of Christopher Daniel Hayes I am a floor-cloth manufacturer and live in Fenchurch-street and have a factory in Hackney-road—the prisoner was my foreman for about sixteen years—he was paid by piece-work—he was able to earn from 30s to 35s a week—the retail business at Hackney-road was very small—the prisoner s attention was confined to that place alone—I keep no clerk there—the prisoner acted as clerk there and I allowed him 4s 6d a week for that—he said to his private friends and accounted to me for that but that was a distinct account altogether—when he received orders it was his duty to place them in the order-book and when he received money he put it down immediately in the cash-book—I am principally in Fenchurch-street—there was no fixed period at which he ought to account to me—it might be six weeks or longer but it was his duty on receiving money to put it down at once—in July last I found he was drunken and had to discharge him—he settled his accounts the following day—there was a balance of half-a-crown due to me which I never received—I did not care about it—after he was gone ou referring to my book I sent out accounts to various customers—the prisoner had never accounted to me for 4l 10s received from Mr Parnell nor 5l from Dr Burder nor 2l 8s 6d from Gopp—they do not appear in the cash-book—the goods were entered in the journal or I should not have found them Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Is your father here A No the prisoner s father had been in the service of our family—he and his father had been employed for forty years for us—the books which he used were left in the desk in the factory which he used—he had the key of that desk—I had the lock picked that I might open it—that was before I discharged him Q Did he not ask for an inspection of the books from you A He never did—that I swear solemnly—he called on me after he was discharged—he did not then demand that the account should be gone into—I demanded it—he did not demand to see the state of the books—this was on the day after his discharge—I settled the cash-book but those accounts that I charge him with embezzling I could not settle—I settled the accounts represented to me Q Were there not books occasionally taken from the factory to Fen-church-street and was not the prisoner left then either to trust to hit memory or take slips of paper to put accounts on and to transfer them to the books when they returned to the factory A Yes but I do hot suppose that was done three times—the books were never away at Fenchurch-street for six weeks together—I took them monthly to Fenchurch-street—one of them might be there sometimes for a fortnight but he had another book to place these things in COURT Q Did the cash-book go away for a fortnight A No the journal I refer to MR PHILLIPS Q Was the cash-book never taken A Yes at sundry times perhaps twice in the year—it might be four times—I swear it was not six times—three books used to go to Fenchurch-street—one went monthly—among the books that went was the cash-book—I generally used to keep it at Fenchurch-street one day—I might keep it a week or I might keep it a fortnight—during that time the prisoner had another book or he might have put the accounts on slips of paper—no doubt there were frequent mistakes in consequence of this Q Did not the prisoner come to you in the month of July after his discharge and ask you to settle the accounts A No I swear I did not give him for answer that another time would do—he called on me on the day after his discharge and we settled the accounts—he called on me several times afterwards—I never told him another time would do after we had settled COURT Q What did he call for A On one occasion he called to ask if I would give him a character and there were several things belonging to him in the place—I turned him away for drunkenness—he was away from Monday till Friday and I wanted the books which was the reason I opened the desk MR PHILLIPS Q Had you no quarrel with him on politics A None sir-—I do not know which way he voted at the election—I never asked him—I voted myself but had no quarrel with him for voting on the opposite side—I do not know that he voted nor that he quitted my place for the purpose of voting—he quitted me at twelve o clock on the Monday MR DOANE Q The journal went regularly every month to Fen-church-street and the cash-book occasionally A Yes—the order-book would still be left with the prisoner—it was not his duty to enter these accounts in the order-book—it was not usual to enter them there—he had a cash-book of his own besides mine—he was in the habit of entering the accounts in his own private cash-book and then transferring them to mine MR PHILLIPS Q What day of the month were the books taken to Fenchurch-street A On the first of each month—it was not on the 2nd of July that the prisoner called on me—I discharged him on the 3rd—the books were not at Fenchurch-street when I discharged him—they were in his desk—that was why I broke it open to send them to Fen-church-street Q When did the books go to Fenchurch-street A On the 1st of July and I discharged the prisoner on the 3rd—the books might be at Fenchurch-street when I discharged him—I have no doubt they were—they were at Fenchurch-street on the 1st of July—I will swear they were and I discharged him on the 3rd—the desk was broken open on the 1st and the books went back from my house to the factory on the 2nd that I swear MR DOANE Q Was the prisoner present on the 1st A No he had absconded from the Monday till the Friday—it was not his duty to be absent—on the 1st of July I wanted the books and he being absent I was obliged to pick the lock to get them—the cash-book is here and these three entries do not appear in it—he had no right to be away as he was doing piece-work which is done in the factory—there are other persons belonging to my establishment living on the premises WILLIAM PARNELL I live in Alfred-terrace Cambridge-road I bought a piece of floor-cloth of the prosecutor—I paid the prisoner on the 29th of May 4l 10s for it—this is the receipt for it—I saw him write it ELIZA ALICE GOPP I live at Hackney I sent a bag to be painted at Mr Hayes s factory in

gave to the footman—I informed Mr Bourne of it afterwards HENRY SHAW In January last I was in the service of Messrs Bourne—on the 17th the prisoner was in their service—I remember the day—two ladies purchased a sable boa—I saw them pay 6l or six guinea to the prisoner over the counter—it was his duty to enter it in the book—in consequence of something that happened I afterwards informed my master—the prisoner left on the evening of the 19th and never returned—I have looked through the book—there is no entry of either of these some—it is customary to take a ticket off an article sold and to enter on the back of it the day it was sold and what it is sold for—the ticket of the boa was found in a drawer after the prisoner left—I have looked through the books and there is no entry of the articles COURT Q Is it usual to put on the back of the ticket the price as well as the day of the sale A The day of the sale but the price is entered in the book—this is the shop-book but each shopman has also a small book and as he sells an article he enters it in this general book MR CLARKSON Q Was there a servant in the establishment who has since gone away A Yes his name is Capon—he left on the 19th the same day as the prisoner and neither of them returned—the accounts of Capon have been examined Prisoner Q What time did I sell the boa to the two ladies A About eight o clock in the evening—I was in the shop when you received the money—it was 6l or six guineas—I believe it was paid in sovereigns Q Who paid it a lady or gentleman A I did not notice—it was laid on the counter—I cannot say whether there was one or two ladies—there might be a gentleman there but such things occur so many times a day and my attention was not called to it till some time after—I believe there was a gentleman with them but cannot say whether it was a lady and gentleman or two ladies and a gentleman—I think it was a gentleman paid the money but cannot swear positively—my back was turned at the time cleaning the windows—I turned round and saw the money on the counter Prisoner The gentleman paid me a 5l note and the lady took a sovereign from her purse COURT Q What became of the boa A The lady took it away either on her neck or in a parcel—my attention was not drawn to this till after the prisoner had absconded on the morning of the 20th—I had not been directed to watch him Prisoner Q Was you not aware I was going before I went in the morning when Samuel Bourne came up with about twenty accounts for me to put the addresses to A No—I was aware you went to Oxford-terrace about a boa but was not aware of the circumstances—I remember Samuel Bourne coming up to Mr Capon with the accounts—I did not call George or William to tell where Mrs Anderson at the Home Regent s-park was—I did not send you down stairs out of the way—I did not tell you not to stop on the premises nor know of your going to a public-house—I have no idea where you went afterwards—I did not go to look for you after the shop was closed nor see Capon that night—I did not go to Hay ward s the Green Man public-house in Berwick-street that night and have ale with you nor leave word where Capon could find you—I was not in Bruton-street that night—I went to meet a friend and was with him all the evening—I did not leave an address at Hayward s where you should write to me nor promise to send you all the particulars how the affair was going on—you were not to address me at Watts and Co s tailors St James street COURT Q What situation did you fill in the shop A I was shop man the same as the prisoner—we never had any differences—I have been in the employ since September last—he was there before me—I do not believe I ever had a word with him Prisoner s Defence On the morning before I left Edward Bourne came up with about twenty different accounts for me to put the addresses on he had a great many accounts to deliver as soon as the boy came in and he was gone I told Shaw I had received 21l 10s for the fur coat which was not accounted for on the 5th of January also the boa which I sold and entered in the sale-book but the leaf was torn out by Capon which I have a witness of if he will speak the truth he will admit seeing him tear it out I told him the boa was entered and I tore off the ticket and put it into the ticket-box if I intended to keep the money back I should not have written the ticket off and put it into the box in the regular way—I wrote it off for the 18th and Mr Bourne had the ticket—the boa was sold on the 17th but it being late at night I entered it on the 18th the leaf was torn out on the Tuesday WILLIAM MAYES examined by the Prisoner I recollect the morning Samuel Bourne brought up the accounts—he asked where the Home was in the Regent s-park—I do not recollect seeing the sable boa entered in the day-book for 6l —I do not recollect seeing Mr Capon with the book down stairs—I remember your coming back to the shop for your coat after the shop was closed on the 19th COURT Q At night before he left for good A Yes Prisoner Q Do you recollect Capon coming there the night before I left A Yes—I do not recollect that Shaw left word if Capon called where he and you were to be found MR CLARKSON Q What situation did you fill in the establishment A A porter—I was not aware that the prisoner or Capon was not coming back next morning—it was not usual for the servants to come after the shop was closed—the prisoner came back for his top-coat On examining the book the entries appeared regular up to the17 th or 18th of March after which there appeared to be a leaf torn out HENRY SHAW re-examined I knew of the sale of this coat but not of the receipt of the money—he never mentioned to me at any time that the prisoner had received it and entered it—he and Capon were not more intimate than shopmen generally are—it is the custom to make some allow ance to noblemen s upper servants when articles are bought—all tradesmen are obliged to do it—here is the prisoner s handwriting in the book both on the 18th and 19th—he was gone on the 20th—there is none of his writing under the head of the 20th—the leaf must have been torn out before he went away—I never heard of the leaf being torn out till the prisoner stated it at the office MR BOURNE re-examined I produce the ticket of the sable boa which was found in the proper drawer— read — 18 —42 dyed sable boa 175 —was to be sold for six guineas and I believe was sold for 6l —the actual price it was sold for is not on the ticket nor should it be—it should be entered in the book—I should know it was sold by finding the ticket in the drawer but it should be entered in the book—the prisoner has written on it the date of sale the 18th of January Prisoner I paid the money over to Capon MR BOURNE One servant was not allowed to enter for another—each entered what he sold and put the money into the desk COURT Q Did you tear the leaf out of the book A Certainly not—I was not aware of it till the prisoner mentioned it at Marlborough-street GEORGE ALGER This witness was sent for at the prisoner s desire and was examined by him I saw Capon tear a leaf out of the book—I cannot recollect when—I think it was about a week or fortnight before he left COURT Q Was there any thing written in the leaf he tore out A I cannot say—I did not see it afterwards—it was more than a day before he left or two or three days I know—it was done in the kitchen about the middle of the day—Capon was often in the kitchen with the books writing—I am a porter—the book was kept in the shop but Capon wrote out of that into other books—I did not see any thing written on the leaf—Capos said nothing to me or I to him—I did not tell Mr Bourne of this—I was at my dinner—there was nobody there besides Capon and me MR CLARKSON Q Was not the prisoner there A No—I did not tell the prisoner I had seen it torn out—I do not know how he heard it—Capon brought the book down himself—I cannot tell whether it was done in the same week as they left—Capon burnt the leaf in my presence-my master was at the other shop in Lamb s Conduit-street at the time I sup pose Prisoner Q Do you recollect Samuel Bourne bringing up some bills one morning A Yes—he asked where the Home in Regent s park was—when he was gone out you did not say in my presence that you had kept back 21l 10s for a coat—I do not recollect any thing of it—you did not tell Shaw in my presence that you had paid over the 21l 10s and not entered it—I did not hear a word about the sable boa nor did I tell you the leaf had been torn out MR BOURNE re-examined I found out that this 21l 10s had been paid on the Saturday after the prisoner absconded—suspecting some thing I directed my partner to apply for the money Prisoner to CHARLES ALGER Q DO you recollect my coming down into the kitchen to dinner the day before I left A I recollect going down while you was at dinner—I do not recollect anything about your being placed down there three or four hours or any time—I remember your going to Mr Wilson s in Oxford-terrace—I did not see you come back—Capon came back after Shaw left the shop that night-nobody told him in my presence where to come to you nor where you were to be found Prisoner Capon came and found me and Shaw in Bruton-street together—we had some rum-and-water—I had not made up my mind to leave at that time—I told him I had kept back the 21l 10s which I had paid over to Capon—also of the boa which I had torn out of the book—Shaw said You run a risk here you will get transported —I said Well I will see it out —he asked if I had any money to defend myself—I said not and he persuaded me to go—he recommended me to go to Page s in Bruton-street— when I came back from Oxford-terrace he would not allow me to come back —I came through different streets opposite No 244 Regent-street and stopped there a quarter of an hour at last it was decided that me and Capon should go Shaw said Well if you are going to leave it won t do for me to be seen with you I will go to Hay ward s in Berwick-street I went to the shop got my greatcoat and two or three things and told William the porter I was going Capon came into the shop at the time there was an 8l cheque in the desk Capon took it and got it changed we went down Berwick-street to Capon s uncle s and he had 10l from the Loan society then went to Berwick-street met Shaw had something to drink and it was arranged I was not to write to Shaw at Regent-street but at No 2 St James s-street at Willis s and Co who I believe are his tailors he then bid me farewell it appears from what he said to my wife and Mrs Capon he was offended because we have not written to say where we were—as we were in Conduit-street he said if he had known Capon had been so much back in his account he would have assisted him but now nothing could be done but our starting as to George and William they knew Capon had been out all day Philip Solomon of Wilstead-street Somers-town deposed to the prisoner s good character GUILTY Aged 31 — Transported for Fourteen Years Fourth Jury before Mr Recorder

employ and then I took him at a salary of 30s a week—it was his duty to carry on business at a house in Compton-street—he conducted that branch of my business—he entered in a book the money he received for things sold and he had to collect money from persons out of the house and to enter that separately—he never accounted to me for 9l 19s 10d as received from Mr Douglas on the 16th of May and there is no account of it in the book—he never accounted to me for 4l 12s 11d or 4l 15s 9d as received on the 27th of May and on the 6th of August of Mr Butler—in consequence of some other matters I directed him to be spoken to by Mr Nonie on the 15th of August and he was taken into custody on the 17th Cross-examined by MR CROUCH Q How long had he been in the service of your family A About four years—it is about four years since he went into that shop in Compton-street—he had been before that in business for himself but he had been in my father s employ before that—he was the proprietor of a

days to my knowledge—he has not complained that he could not get it—I have no recollection of its being left for me to examine—I do not recollect any mistakes with regard to monies not being paid by the prisoner—he was in the habit of selling things for me but not of buying certainly Q Has he at no time been ordered to pay money out of what he received to persons to whom you were indebted A I once told him to pay the rent of the house in Compton-street—I never told him to pay money due by me to my knowledge—I occasionally call at the house in Compton-street and I have on one or two of those occasions received cash of him—I do not know whether it was marked down in the book then but it was on the following Monday—I remember only one instance of receiving money without giving a voucher—I am not aware that I have applied to persons for money after the money has been accounted for to me by the prisoner—I have carried on the business about five months—the two last sums in the indictment are due to myself—part of the first is due to the estate—I certainly never paid the prisoner any portion of the profits on goods sold and delivered—I never discounted bills for him to my

his name to both Cross-examined Q To whom were these sums of money owing A To Mr Price—the goods I paid for in May were what I had in April—on the 6th of August the prisoner paid me some money for a few goods that I supplied him with on his own account—he did very little business on his own account but I have supplied him with things—I do not know whether Mr Price knew of it—the money I received of the prisoner was 2l 3s for some goods that the prisoner had the use of—I never supplied Mr Price with any goods—I thought it was Price and Son I did not know JOSEPH NORIE I am foreman to Mr Price In consequence of some other transactions I spoke to the prisoner about his account on the 15th of August—this book of his was before me—I asked him whether it contained all the money he had received—he said Yes —I have looked through it to see if it contains these three sums mentioned in this indictment—there is no entry of any of them—here is a settlement at the end of the week after the 16th of May at the end of the week after the 27th of May and at the end of the week after the 6th of August—there is a balance on the week after the 6th of August but that does not contain the 4l 15s 9d from Mr Butler Cross-examined Q Are you in the habit of settling the book with the prisoner A No—I did not go to demand money of the prisoner—I asked him about it—he generally brought the book down on Monday mornings and took it away with him—I do not recollect one instance when he left it—he has never complained to me about his accounts being irregularly kept to my knowledge—the book was never kept from him to my knowledge—I had nothing to do with the book—I do not know of any bill transaction between customers of the prisoner and my master—I never knew my master to discount bills for coffin-makers at the instance of the prisoner Q Did the prisoner never mention to you about the irregularity of Mr Price s accounts A He might have said something—he did say something at one time about one trifling thing but I cannot tell what it was—it was of no consequence—I cannot say whether that was in old Mr Price s time or young Mr Price s—I believe the prisoner has taken a house near my master s on his own responsibility—this case has been got up since we knew that—we never had any suspicion of him previously but found his accounts regularly kept JOSEPH PRICE re-examined Q Do you know of the prisoner having taken a house near your premises A Yes next door—I believe I mentioned to him that I did not like it—I do not know that I have mentioned it to any one else—I think he has had it about six weeks Cross-examined Q Do you know a Mr Nodes of Tottenham Court-road A Yes—I have not had a conversation with him about this house that the prisoner has taken—I do not know that I have mentioned it to any one—I have an indistinct idea that I mentioned it to a friend of mine—I have not watched the prisoner s conduct since he took this house more narrowly than previously John

parish of St Margaret Westminster and St John the Evangelist Westminster Mr William Bent is one of them and there are others—they are governors of the poor—the prisoner was employed by them as collector of the poor-rates—he has been so for many years—I have the poor-rate book here for the year 1843—the rate is made annually and collected in three instalments—it was the regular course of business to give the prisoner a copy of the rate for the purpose of his carrying it in his pocket to go about to collect the rate—that was done with respect to the rate for 1843—I saw him with the book in his possession and there were always blank printed forms of receipts given him to give to the parties who paid the rates—it was his duty to pay the money he received to the bankers—here is the printed account of the rules and regulations—it is printed in the head of the book which is given him to collect with—I have here the book in which it was his custom to enter the sums he received in the course of each week—the week ending on the 4th of May last is the last account which he rendered to me—here is the account of what he charged himself with having received in the preceding week—it was his duty to render that account to me every week and he did so every week and upon my checking it with his account it was his custom to pay the money into the bankers and then it was his duty to bring me the receipt from the bankers to show that he had paid it in—on the week ending the 4th of May he charges himself with having received 93l 14s 3d —he brought that account to me on Monday the 6th of May—he did not bring me a receipt showing that he had paid this amount into the banker s—in consequence of that I went in pursuance of directions and saw the prisoner at his house on Tuesday the 7th of May—I asked him the reason this money had not been paid in—he hesitated some time and then said he had not paid it in—I then said Is that all is there nothing else there are some large amounts outstanding have any of these been received —he said They have —he came to me on the following evening and dictated to me a list of the sums in which he was a defaulter—the sums which he had received and not accounted for—they amounted to 538l 10s 6d —that included the 94l Q Turn to his account which should contain any sum received by him on the 18th of Dec do you find in that an account of the receipt of 2l 12s 6d from Mr Smith A No—there is no such entry as Smith 2l 12s 6d —in the statement he dictated to me of the sums in which he was a defaulter I find Smith 2l 12s 6d entered—in the week in which the receipts of the 20th of March ought to be included here is Mr Fulford 1l 2s 6d for a rate received on 20th March due at Michaelmas but there is no entry for the rate due at Christmas—this is the only entry in his account of Fulford but in the account he dictated to me of his deficiencies Fulford s account is not brought in at all—there is no entry in his account of 2l 12s 6d received from Smith on the 25th of March but in the account which he dictated of his deficiencies here is Smith 2l 12s 6d as money he had received and not accounted for—I have seen the prisoner write and know his handwriting—I believe these receipts of Mr Smith and Mr Fulford s are the prisoner s writing Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you on the 7th of May take the prisoner s books away A Yes—he had no access to them between the 7th and the 8th of May—on the 8th he went through his books with me and pointed out these defalcations and among them is 2l 12s 6d received of Mr Smith on 18th Dec —I did not mention Mr Fulford s name to him nor he to me—the sum he charged himself with was 93l 14s 3d which he had received the week before—I compared it with the books and that is the amount MR BODKIN Q This 1l 2s 6d put down to Fulford is up to Michaelmas A Yes—I have looked through all the books since this matter has transpired several times and the Christmas account of Mr Fulford has never been brought to account—the prisoner was paid by a poundage HENRY FULFORD I am one of the rate-payers of the parishes of St Margaret s and St John the Evangelist Westminster—here is a receipt for 1l 2s 6d for the Christmas instalment of poor-rate which I paid on the 20th of March ALFRED TAYLOR I am clerk of the police-court Queen-square—I took the depositions in the presence of

received both the checks back from our bankers Spooner and Attwoods—these are them WILLIAM WATSON I live in St Ann s-lane and am a stationer I deal with the prosecutors—I paid the prisoner 8l 13s on the 12th of April on account of Messrs Magnays—I took this receipt of him Cross-examined by MR ALLEN Q How long have you been in the habit of doing business with the prisoner A I should think twelve or fourteen years—he has not been all that time at Messrs Magnays—I have not paid him large sums—my business is not very large—I recognized him as acting as clerk or traveller for Messrs Magnay—I have dealt with them for some time and have generally paid what sums were due to them to the prisoner—I should think he has been there about five years—I had an account with Messrs Magnay—the orders for the goods were obtained by the prisoner—my transactions have been through him or the traveller who called—I gave orders to the traveller and he would call for the money at a certain time MR BALLANTINE Q How long have you dealt with Messrs Magnay A I should think ten years—I did so before the prisoner had the situation—I had always dealt with the travellers—I cannot charge my memory that I have seen Messrs Magnay at all—I always paid the travellers money on account of Messrs Magnay WILLIAM WING WILSON I am clerk to Spooner Attwood and Co I gave cash for this check for 21l 2s 6d —I paid it across the counter JOHN DAVIES I am clerk to Spooner and Co I paid this check for 13l across the counter I do not know to whom JAMES SELLER I am in the employ of Sir William Magnay who has one partner The prisoner was in their employ as out-door clerk—it was his duty to collect orders and to receive money which it was his duty to enter in his own book and pay it over to me the same day that he received it—the book he kept was one in which he ought to enter the goods he sold and the money he received and in the evening he would say what monies he had received and pay them to me—he did not pay me a check for 21l 2s 6d nor the proceeds of it—he did not at any time pay me a check of 13l nor the proceeds of it—if he had paid me the checks they would have gone through our bankers—these checks have not been through my hands at all—he never paid me 8l 13s in cash on account of Mr Watson—it was his duty to pay checks and money to me Cross-examined Q What are you the cashier A Yes—it was hit duty to pay it over to me as soon as he received it—that was the rule of the house—it is very likely I might have told him it was his duty to do to—I have no knowledge that Mr Magnay has done so in my hearing—a month has not intervened between the times of his accounting to me—when I receive money I enter it in a book in which I enter money for the bankers—on Saturday or any other day the prisoner comes about five o clock and pays me and I enter the sums—he has never brought in large sums which have been collected during several days—this if the cash-book—I enter in this book from whom I receive the money—it agrees with the bankers -book—I do not put down the prisoners name in this book—I put down the money as received from Mr Watson if it was received from him—this book would not tell from whose hands I received it—I sign the prisoner s own book as having received the money—this is it—the whole of this book I believe is the prisoner s writing—here is the month of Nov —here is no entry of 21l 2s 6d on the 16th the 18th or the 19th—he enters in this book the goods he sells and gives credit for the cash he receives—they are entries of orders from different persons and of cash—here is one entry Donnison by cash 3l 7s and some others—these are goods sold by him—some of them have a credit entry under them and some have not—those which have no credit under them would not be paid at the time—if he receives the money he enters it gives me the money and I sign this book—the ledger will show all the money I received from him but the entries are not in his name it will only indicate that I received the money from Watson or from any other customer—the prisoner had no access to the ledger—the ledger and cash-book contain the amounts of all the money I receive from all the clerks—this book of the prisoner s contains my signatures for what money he paid—the largest sum he has paid me is 50l 60l 70l or 80l for one individual—he never paid any sum in gross composed of more than one debt—I would not have taken it so—if in the course of his business he received 19s 6d he would pay it when he came in at night—he was there every night and I was there and this pass-book passed between us every night Q Do you mean to say that he did not do a great deal of business for Sir William Magnay without your knowing anything about it except receiving the money A He certainly did not—he was out-door clerk—he did not write in the street his duty was performed in the counting-house—he was a person taking orders from any person he could get them from and receiving the money—that was part of his business—he was a clerk or traveller—the terms to me are both synonymous—I call myself a clerk—if I went collecting orders as I have done I should still call myself a clerk—the prisoner used to write in the counting-house MR BALLANTINE Q Was it his duty to collect money and pay it over to you A Yes that was his duty from the first outset and he hat done so for the last six or seven years—this book contains the entries of goods that he has sold not that he had delivered only sold—this book was always in the counting-house and we saw the goods that he had sold and sent them out by the porter—no sum of money would appear to these orders—it was his duty to collect the money GEORGE MAGNAY ESQ I am in partnership with Sir William Magnay The prisoner was in our service—it was his duty to receive money and to account for it the day he received it—he had to collect orders in London only not in the country—there is a country traveller and a town clerk-about two months ago I spoke to the prisoner about 21l 2s 6d due from Teape and Son—I said It is very strange that Mr Teape has not paid his account being so wealthy a man —he said It will be paid next Saturday —that had reference to the 21l 2s 6d Cross-examined Q I believe you have been very unfortunate in your servants A Yes a great portion of them have been taken up and are to be prosecuted on some charge of felony—they were charged before Sir Peter Laurie and were remanded—in the first instance I charged the prisoner as being one concerned in that felony in point of fact with stealing paper—he was remanded at my request but if he could have found bail they would have taken it—Sir Chapman Marshall I believe heard the case first—he admitted him to bail but he did not find bail and continued in custody—I think he was not in custody on a charge of felony more than a week and then we brought this charge—he was remanded on account of the embezzlement—our first charge was that be stole our property and he was remanded on that charge—we did not at that time make a charge of embezzlement—the second time he was brought up before Sir Peter Laurie and I am not quite certain whether the charge of larceny was gone into against him—I think that was the time that the charge of embezzlement was made against him—I told Sir Peter Laurie we had charges of embezzlement against him on which he remanded him at my request—I told Mr Clarkson we had charges of embezzlement—when we made the charge of embezzlement the charge of larceny was not abandoned but we have abandoned it now—he it not now here on a charge of larceny—I think he was taken up about the 18th or 19th of April Q Within a few days afterwards did he not tender through his solicitor all his accounts and the whole balance A Not to me—his friends had got the money and wanted to make it a debtor and creditor account but I would not—the money was not produced—they said We have got the money if you will abandon the charge —I do not know that any account was produced—it was not produced to me—I have seen no account—the money was not tendered—the expression made use of was The money is in my pocket if you like to take it —I had not then been examined on oath on the charge of embezzlement—I think I was examined on oath to substantiate this charge on the 14th of May which was a few days after the person told me he had the money—but I had intimated that I should have a charge of embezzlement against him MR BALLANTINE Q Is there a person named Dodge charged with having received some property stolen by your servants A Yes some paper was found on his premises with the prisoner s handwriting on it—when the money was offered me by a person I was acquainted with these acts of embezzlement—I had no offer at all before I knew the circumstances which gave rise to this charge of embezzlement—the words used to me were to abandon the charge and make it a debtor and creditor account COURT Q Was any tender made on the part of the prisoner before there was anything said about embezzlement A To the best of my belief not MR ALLEN Q Had you in fact made any charge by calling evidence before the money was tendered or was it not privately whispered by Mr Clarkson A I believe Mr Clarkson said he had a case of embezzlement—he said it aloud COURT TO MR SELLERS Q Supposing he had received these checks would it be his duty to change them and bring you the money A Undoubtedly not he had no business to do it GUILTY — Transported for Seven Years

t18470104-408  408 EDMUND WEBBER was indicted for embezzlement MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JAMES KIRTON I am a corn-chandler and live in Charles-street Middlesex Hospital I am a customer of Giles and Co —on the 11th of Dec I owed them 56l 6s which I paid to the prisoner in notes and gold on the 11th of Dec —I had known him as a Giles s clerk some years HENRY ASTE I am a corn-chandler and live in Tottenham Court-road I deal with Mr Giles—on the 5th of Oct I purchased to the amount of 626l 11s 4d which became due tow months after on the 5th of Dec —I paid it to the prisoner on the 4th of Dec being market-day—on the 7th of Oct I purchased to the amount of 718l 11s 10d of Mr Giles which became due on the 7th of Dec —I paid that to the prisoner on the 7th of Dec by this check FREDERICK KERCHEVALL I am chief clerk to Mr James Sharpe Giles—he has no partner The prisoner has been in his employ about eight years—he was a clerk under me—it was part of his duty to collect money from customers—this is what we call our long-book used at market containing the original entries of what sales are made on the particular dates—I find on the 5th of Oct a sale to Aste 626l 11s 4d and on the 7th of Oct 718l 11s 10d —those sums became payable at two months after the sales—it was the prisoner s duty to collect them—he kept the book produced for that purpose—it is his collecting-book—it is his duty to make it out from the market-book—to copy it from the market-book—here is no entry in the collecting-book on the 5th of Oct of Mr Aste s transaction—his name is not mentioned—on the 12th he has an entry 626l 11s 4d as if the sale took place on that day—there is no entry whatever on the 7th—there is no entry of the 718l odd on the 7th and that is not in the book at all—here is another book which we call the market cash-book containing the various sums received from the different buyers on the different dates stated togehter with the transactions to which it refers—whoever received money at market would give it to the prisoner and before he went to the banker s in the afternoon he would enter the various sums which is done by putting the checks on the City banker s in an alphabetical list first casting them up and then entering the amounts making the exact amount received—it was his duty to enter all sums he received on account of Mr Giles—the other clerks who received would enter in this book and give the money to the prisoner—there are several handwritings in it—the prisoner would see that he had the money and write on the opposite page the different kinds of money of which it was composed checks notes or cash—he ought to enter on the credit side of the book the sum paid into the banker s—I find no entry of 56l 6s 6s from Kirton neither the name nor amount—the entries of the day except two are in the prisoner s writing—the discharge on the other side is his writing—he paid into the bank that day 1 508l 14s 3d —here is another amount afterwards of 45l received from James Ford after making up the cash for the day and it was paid into the banker s—Kirton s name does not appear nor does any corresponding amount of 56l 6s appear to have been received in any way whatever—I find no entry in the cash account on the 4th Dec on the side where he enters what he has received of the amount of 626l from Mr Aste neither the amount nor name—on the discharge side I find an entry of a check on Spooner s of 599l 17s 6d —that indicates that he has carried to Smith and Payen s a check on Spooner s for that amount—I find no entry in the cash account of the 7th of Dec of 718l 11s 10d received from Aste neither name nor amount nor on the 8th—on the 9th Henry Aste is credited for 626l 11s 4d relating to the transaction of the 12th of Oct and on the discharge side there is a check on Barclay s for 626l 11s 4d Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q These dealings are extremely large are they not A Yes—9 000l or 10 000l passed through his hands from the 30th of Nov till he was given into custody on the 12th of Dec —very likely from 20 000l to 30 000l a month passed through his hands—the names of all the persons described as paying money on the 11th of Dec are entered—this 45l odd is in the prisoner s writing—I should say it was made immediately after he balanced his cash before he went to the banker s because he paid it in—I have gone as far back into the books as business would allow and have no doubt these sums have been taken latterly to cover other sums originally taken—the prisoner admitted that to me himself and there is no doubt of it from the books—we distinguish in the books the account of checks and money—we should put coutt s checks under a line to keep them from those bankers who clear and then the checks on bankers who do not clear—he paid into the bank 225l in bank notes and 66l 10s in money on the 11th—there is no item on the debit side applying to 225l or 66l because many customers pay partly by check and partly by money—it does not appear what sums are paid by cash—we have no means of telling with certainty but I myself know who the different parties bankers are JOHN WALLIS I am clerk to Messrs Barclay—Mr Aste has an account with our house—these two checks for 626l 11s and 718l 11s 10d have been paid by our house through the clearing ARTHUR PUGH I am clerk to Messers Smith and payne—the prosecutors keep cash with us—here is the book in which the particular payments made to our house are first entered—the prisoner was in the habit of paying money on Giles s account daily—he usually brought a list of the checks on a slip of paper and I detach the portion containing the clearing lists and enter the other checks from his paper—on the 4th of Dec he paid in on Giles s account 2 619l 18s and 49l 10s a check on Young s—I pasted in my book the list he brought—here is a check on Barclay for 526l 17s 6d —on the 9th he paid in 2 532l 12s 5d —that consisted of a check on Barclay s for 718l 11s 6d among others—there was no check paid on that day on Barclay s for 626l 11s 4d WILLIAM GILES I have received a letter from the prisoner enclosing 40l 4s GUILTY Aged 38 —

Counts varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution DANIEL TINNISWOOD MILLER I am the principal teller in the office of Sir Francis Hastings Doyle Bart the Receiver-General of Customs At the time this occurred and some time before the prisoner was an assistant teller in that department—it was his duty to receive monies from merchants and others who have to pay money into the Receiver-General s office at the Custom House—there is a cash-book in which he should enter all such receipts—he had payments to make as well as to receive—it was his duty to enter on the other side of that account the payments he so made and the account should be balanced every day—his duty on making up his accounts at the end of the day was to hand over the notes to me—the cash that he took in the course of the day was generally retained in the cash-box till next morning and was to be delivered up to me the first thing next morning—he handed to me at the end of the day a memorandum of the whole of the money he had taken the amount of notes he had got the amount of payments he had made and the amount of the money he had retained in the box all of which I had to enter in my book at the end of each day—it was a memorandum transcribed from his book—before he gave me that memorandum it was his duty to balance his cash-book and then to transcribe this from it—on the 9th of Jan last I acquainted the principals of the office that I had suspicion of him and they desired him to make up his accounts—that was about half-past eleven in the day—he was then in the Treasury in which office we all transact our business—on that order being given to him he continued to take money until eleven o clock and did not make up his accounts—he then left the office and I saw or heard nothing more of him till he was taken into custody on this charge on Saturday July 31st—he had a desk in the office where he was employed—it had drawers of which he had the keys—his desk and drawers were left open I acquainted the principals that he was gone and they were examined in my presence—his book was taken possession of and the money that was found in his drawers—I produce the book—I find entered in it in his writing thirty-four receipts as received on that day—they amount to 2 783l 7s 9d —I find on the other side there payments amounting to 130l 3s 3d he ought to have had a balance left in his drawer of 2 652l 14s 6d —I found notes and cash in his drawer—they were not examined in my presence—the notes handed to me by Mr France the Assistant Receiver-General amounted to 2 310l and 72l 14s 6d in cash—the balance was 2 382l 14s 6d —there was 270l deficient Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Do those thirty-four receipts all purport to have been received on the 9th of January A Yes the payments were also made on the same day—I have made no inquiry to ascertain whether other payment were made by him on that day—it required no inquiry—I have the names of the persons from whom these different sums were received—they are different sums of money—it was the prisoner s duty to deliver me an account of all receipts at the end of each day—he left on the 9th of Jan about one o clock—that was considerably before the period when it was his duty to account to me—a suspicion had been intimated against him that his accounts were wrong and after that he absconded—the aggregate was usually summed by him but not on that day he left his accounts unsettled and it was done by Mr Franc—the entries do not show at what time the monies were received—but he received the whole between ten and one o clock in the morning GEORGE FRANC I am Assistant Receiver-General of the Customs in London—the prisoner was an Assistant Teller in the Receiver-General s office—on the 9th of Jan last in consequence of information I went into the Treasury-office where he was employed and told him to make up his accounts immediately and bring me his money—he said he would—it was his duty to do so on my giving him those directions—I afterwards received a communication from Mr Miller that he was absent in consequence of which I went to the desk which he occupied and took the money from his drawers took his book into my room and made up his accounts myself—this is the book—I handed over to Mr Miller the money that I took from his desk and the book from which he made up the accounts—I took all that I found in his desk—I found 2310l in notes and 72l 14s 6d in cash amounting together to 2382l 14s 6d —I handed over the whole of the money I found in the desk to Mr Miller—I examined the book to see what he had received and what he had paid—the deficiency as appears on his account was 270l —I never saw him again till he appeared at the Mansion-house Cross-examined Q Did you count the money and notes yourself A Yes and ascertained the amount—he was in the habit from day to day of receiving very large sums of money—he has been in the service of the Customs eight years MR CLARKSON Q Are all these accounts in his own writing A Yes they are accounts of the receipt and payment of public monies CHARLES BAWTREE I am a clerk in the Bank of England—I produce a 200l and a 50l Bank note—they were exchanged at the Bank of England for gold on the 9th of January—I do not know by whom—there is S or B Lambert on them MR PARISH I am a clerk in the Bank of England—on the 9th of Jan these notes were presented by the prisoner for gold—he wrote his name on them—I believe this to be his writing but cannot say I saw him write it—I recollect his person—he had two hundred and fifty sovereigns given him for them Cross-examined Q What time of day was this A From half-past nine to ten o clock in the morning I think but I am not at all sure about the time WILLIAM CRAFTER I am one of the constables of the Board of Customs—on the 12th of July in consequence of information I went to Croydon in search of the prisoner—I found him there and took him into custody—I told him he must consider himself my prisoner for the robbery he had committed at the Customs—he seemed very much agitated and said he wished he had given himself up at the first and settled the business he though it would have been most likely all at an end by this time he was very sorry for it it would have saved him a great deal of trouble MR BALLANTINE contended that as there only was proof of a general deficiency of money and not of any particular sums the prisoner could not be convicted of embezzlement The COURT considered that if the Jury were of opinion that he took the 270l out of the money received that day intending to appropriate it to his own use he was guilty of embezzlement Thomas Tasker wine-merchant William Nash provision-merchant of the Minories James Buckland

t18481218-330  330 SAMUEL SMITH MICKLEBURGH embezzling the sums of 2l 8s —2l 2s and 1l 8s the moneys of William Henry Fleming his master MESSRS CLARRSON and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution WILIIAM HENRY FLEMING I am a brewer of Camberwell-green The prisoner was my clerk and had been so several years—it was his duty to receive money paid at the counting-house from the draymen who might collect it in the course of their rounds and from customers who called to pay—it was his duty to keep a day-book cash-book and ledger—when goods went out it was hisduty to enter them in the day-book and also to enter in the day-book and cash-book all moneys received—it was his duty to enter money in the day-book as soon as it was paid and in the course of the day to enter all he had received in the cash-book—I used to look at both books and it was from them that I received information of the receipts—I balanced the day-book every week and ascertained whether the cash-book corresponded with it and if I did I put my initials to them as correct—it was his duty to keep the ledger—that was posted from the day-book—both goods and money would appear there—if carried from the day-book into the ledger it would be carried to the different customers accounts—sometimes I examined the ledger and the day-book but at other times the prisoner and the boy in the office did—I did not examine the ledger so frequently as the day-book—if goods appeared in the ledger which were not paid I should send to the customer at the usual time for the amount—I send in the bills every three months—they were made out on the accounts appearing due in the ledger—the prisoner left on 3rd Oct —before that I bad balanced the cash-book with him—he did not mention any sums of money but those that appeared there—after he left I looked at all the books and made extracts from the ledger—this is a list made from a longer list which I made firs — produced —one list has been destroyed and two preserved—the one from which this was made is destroyed—I showed this one to the prisoner and also the others—I sent for him on 27th Oct after I had examined the books—I then showed him this list—the day-book the ledger and cash-book were before me—I called his attention to these sums of 2l 8s on 8th March 2l 2s on 22nd March and 28s on 1st June—none of those items appeared in the cash or day-book—they appear by the ledger to have been paid—I pointed those out to him with other sums—he appeired confused and said he could not make out how it was that the sums were posted in the ledger not being in the day-book there must be some mistake—I asked if the cash in the cash-book agreed with the day-book always—he said it did—he looked through the cash and day-books and I told him he had robbed me of the money and that it was a serious charge—my brother who is an attorney was present—he told the prisoner he did not wish him to commit himself there that if he would appoint his solicitor to meet him with me next morning at half-past nine o clock we would open the books to his inspection—he left shortly after writing a note to his solicitor—he commenced writing it on the back of an old letter—I handed him some note-paper envelopes and sealing-wax—he then wrote a note sealed it and took it away with him—about four o clock before I left I locked up the books—the whole of them had been examined in the prisoner s presence—they were in the iron safe close to the counting-house door—I received information in the course of the night went to my premises about one in the morning and found them in flames—the brewery and dwelling-house are entirely destroyed and the premises adjoining the counting-house where the books were kept—one story below was saved and the stables—in searching the premises 1 found some books partly burnt and some not burnt at all—two ledgers and part of a day-book are here—this is the ledger of 1848— produced —it was perfect when I left it on 27th—it is now partially destroyed by fire—the cash-book in which these three accounts were is totally destroyed—from March up to June inclusive are destroyed—I find no entry in the ledger of Bagsbaw s account on 4th March—there is 2l 8s to Bagshaw s credit on 8th March as received in the prisoner s writing—here is George Dollond s account 22nd March credit for 1l 2s in the prisoner s writing—there is no entry on 16th March—on 1st June credit is given to Baron s account for 1l So in the prisoner s writing—I had pointed out to the prisoner that those three sums did not appear in the cash or day-book and requested him to look in advance and back and see if they were entered in any other date but he could find no entry—on 1st June Mr Baron s servant ought to have brought the book down—this is it— produced —it is receipted by the prisoner when the money was paid—here is By cash S Mickleburgh 1l 8s —here is George Dollond s bill By cash S Mickleburgh 16th March 1848 2l 2s —here is Mr Bagshaw s bill Received for Fleming and Co 4th March 1848 2l 2s —all in the prisoner s writing Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q How long was the prisoner in your service A Upwards of eight years—I had given him notice to leave before Midsummer but he remained until Oct —he had not obtained another situation and I consented to his remaining—I did not ask him to stay—a disagreement between us took place on 2nd Oct —I had been to Croydon that day and when I returned Lewis an exciseman Was on my premises—I am not aware that he said he came for an Act of Parliament—I thought he had no business there—I did not swear at the prisoner that I am aware of—I do not remember that I told him to keep his friends off my premises or anything of that sort—he did not say I am here working for you from seven in the morning till nine at night and if any person wants me they must come here to see me as an excuse for his friends calling on him—he said he was in the counting-house from seven o clock in the morning till seven at night and thought it was long enough for any clerk who received his salary—Mr Lewis was in the passage leading to my counting-house—I had previously given the boy instructions that if Lewis came to the counting-house so frequently to order him away—he was in the habit of coming there frequently for beer—Lewis had heard this from the boy and said I want to speak to you sir —I said What is it —he said I understand you told the boy 1 was not to come here for beer —I said Certainly I don t see what right you have here —he said he thought he had a right to beer for he had given instructions to Mr Miekleburgh in gauging and he was one of the best gaugers in the kingdom and worth 700l a year—I then said You have been teaching Mickleburgh gauging in my time and Mickleburu h answered It was not in your time it was after your time that is from seven in the morning till seven at night and that is enough for my salary —I ordered Lewis off the premises and I said to the prisoner If your services are worth 700l a year in gauging you had better go and get it I will not be bullied in my own counting-house —I told him next morning he should come and make up his accounts and settle his cash-book and we would part—I did not ask for the key and the cash that night—I swear I did not say D - - you if I find one shilling wrong in your accounts I will transport you —he did not collar me—he never attempted such a thing—I cannot swear whether Mr Dance was there Mr Standon was—he is the son of a publican—no one came in and separated us—we never came together or quarrelled in that way—he never attempted to make any quarrel about the matter—I do not know that I used an oath or any expression of the sort I deny that he attempted to make any difficulty about the matter I told him to make up his books and he never appeared violent to me at all nor I to him I merely stated what I have said and he received it as a servant should—I do not remember saying to him If you want your pals wait till your time is over —the prisoner called next day on me made up his cash-book and paid over the balance—I paid him his wages every month 26l —there was a quarter owing—I did not give him a quarter in advance—he was hired at monthly wages—there was a regular agreement to that effect but it was destroyed by the fire—we examined the day and cash-books together and made them balance—he told me before leaving that if there was any incorrectness in the accounts he would come and explain them—it was on Tuesday the 3rd Oct that he made up the cash-book with me and paid me over the balance—he helped Dance to pay the men on the following day—I met him on 25th Oct —he did not ask me to be allowed to go through the accounts—he did not say anything about the accounts—he asked me to give him a character to obtain a situation at Messrs Combe Delafield and Co- s—I had then discovered several of the accounts that he had embezzled and I avoided a direct answer and said I would consider of it—I had gone through the accounts with Mr Dance and I showed some of them to my father—I had not gone through the whole we only took the ledger from the day the prisoner left me backwards to 1st Jan 1848—we there discovered 86l odd deficient in the prisoner s writing—on 25th Oct the prisoner offered to come to the premises and take out the book-debts— after the bills are delivered to the customers it was our habit to enter the whole amount of them in a book to assist in the collection of them—that is what we call taking out the book-debts taking out the amount due on the ledger into another book —I thanked him and said if I wanted him I would send for him Q On 26th Oct did you go to his brewery A I went to Mr Turney s brewery in Addington-square Camberwell to see the prisoner—I did not know that the prisoner was brewing there—I was not aware that he was managing that brewery—I know Mr Turney—I went to ask the prisoner to come to the counting-house on the next day—I had been to his house to inquire for him and his wife said he was at Mr Turney s—I think I sent a clerk to ask for him—the answer was not that he was at his own brewery in Addington-square—I saw Mr Turney at the brewery—I went in my chaise —I think I shook bands with the prisoner when I got out I do not know that I did I will not swear it—I really do not know whether I did or not—Mr Turncy took me over the brewery and the prisoner accompanied us—I asked him to come to the counting-house at two o clock next day to take out the book-debts not to go through the accounts—I wanted him for the purpose of tolling him of those accounts which were irregular—I did not tell him so—I took a glass of ale with Mr Turney before I left—the prisoner asked me to taste some ale—I did so—I think it was of his brewing—Mr Turney and he were together—I tasted several casks of beer—I think the prisoner said they were his brewing—I said I thought they were very good—I did not tell him one word about the embezzlement I had found out—I should have thought he would not have come if I had—he came according to appointment—my solicitor was there—I had not told the prisoner the day before that I would have my solicitor there—my brother suggested that the prisoner should come on a future occasion provided with his own solicitor—one of the draymen s books of 1848 was produced on that occasion—there are two draymen s books relating to this day-book and two relating to the other—one of those books was produced at this interview—the other the drayman had out—I do not know whether those of the second ledger were out but they did not refer to this—there has been no indictment preferred against the prisoner for the first item on this paper Gale 7l 1s 29 May —I swear there was no entry of that 7l 1s in the day-book or in the cash-book—I entered into conversation with the prisoner about it—from that item we went to Crowder s which was next—I swear I have no entry in any of my books of the 7l 1s as paid to myself—I did not direct the prisoner to make an entry of it in the ledger in his own writing—I swear I never directed him to do anything of the sort—there were cross accounts between me and Gale—he is a cork-cutter and supplied me—I do not recollect my brother saying What do you propose to do about the errors when the prisoner said on referring to his book that there were errors somewhere—I did not see the prisoner endeavouring to extricate the horses at the fire—I saw him there—I do not know that he was wet or that he was endeavouring to extinguish it for I gave him in charge as soon as I saw him I was hunting him out—he did not come up to me with Dance and say This is a dreadful affair Sir or anything of the sort—he was taken before the Magistrate next morning—I believe he was not remanded on the charge of arson but discharged as there was not sufficient evidence but as he was leaving the Court the charge of embezzlement was made and a remand was granted—part of Mr Branch his father-in-law s premises abut on mine—he did not live there—part of his furniture was on my premises in a little back room of the dwelling-house at the back of the counting-house which was burnt down—I was insured—I had four ledgers two are here relating to the private trade and two relating to the public-house trade are destroyed—I am able to show from this book what my debts are—I did not apply for a remand on the arson case in order to have an investigation before the Coroner I think my brother who managed the case mentioned it and the Magistrate thought it would be a very good plan—I know Mr De Pledge very well I never told him the brewery was a d - - d expensive concern and I wished it was burnt down—I had four ledgers three day-books and a cash-book—I had a private cash-book ledger and journal there were drayman s books besides and load-books which the beer was booked into—sometimes when the goods were entered in the day-book the drayman would receive the money and enter it in his book the name of the drayman would appear in the cash-book—there are four draymen one is named Moore— when the prisoner comes home he enters the gross amount received from the draymen in the cash-book in the draymans name—the dravrmn would bring his book and call out the names and the prisoner booked it into the day-book the draymen s books were made out by districts—it might happen that a drayman in one district would receive a sum for another that would go down in the day book on the day in which he received it—the voucher given by the drayman to the customer is the receipted bill signed by himsell—it may have occurred that a receipt has been signed by the drayman before he went out but not to my knowledge—when I received money I never told the prisoner to give a receipt for it—if he gave the receipt he took the money—I may have taken it from a customer s hand and given it him if he receipted the bill—I never told him to give a receipt and put the money into my pocket—I had a customer at Lambeth Workhouse—I have frequently received 172l there it was always by cheque—I cross the cheque and generally take a receipt and write it there—I have not asked the prisoner to give a receipt to my knowledge I will not swear I have not—I have a lease of The Fleece public-house a friend of the prisoner s had it who died the prisoner had lent him 50l and the widow did not wish to continue the house I bought it of her—I allowed the prisoner to let the 50l remain I owed it him—I paid him by a cheque on 17th Jan —he had not an interest in the house—he has made no further claim against me—I do not know that a message was sent to Hunt to ask whether she had paid the 2l 2s or not she is the person who pays for Mr Dollond—the prisoner did not mention that to me when the lists were produced—I receive from 12 000l to 13000l in the year a large portion of which would pass through the prisoner s hands MR BALLANTINE Q What amounts have you received from the Lambeth workhouse A From 75l to 300l —they were entered by me in the day-book and by the prisoner in the cash-book—I handed the cheque over to him on all occasions having first crossed it—I have paid no money over to him since January 1848 our plan changed then and he has only made up his cash-books of the sums he received—they appear in the cash-book but are not carried out into the margin—he writes on the top Mr Fleming s collection and I should not charge his account with it—the sums the draymen received were entered in the day-book to the separate customers who paid them—I was insured in the Kent Fire-office for 1400l and in the Phœnix for 3600l —my claim on one for the part that was burnt was 2700l and on the other 1300l —I have been paid both but not the whole of the 2700l they charged me for the salvage COURT Q Were appointments made after the first examination before the Magistrate with the prisoner to go through the accounts A The accounts were destroyed—there was a meeting with his solicitor at my brothers house I think—I then had these books—the Magistrate requested that an opportunity might be given to the prisoner to go through the books as far as we could procure them and we did so—he has not given me any explanation since CATHERINE HUNT I am in the service of Mr George Dollond of North-terrace Cimberwell who deals with Mr Fleming for beer—on 16th March I paid the prisoner 2l 2s for beer—he gave me this receipt read— Received or G Dollond Esq for ale 2l 2s Signed— by cash S Mickleburgh 16th March 1848 Cross-examined Q Were you sent for to know whether it was paid or not A No—I never was at Mr Fleming s—there was a mistake me one bill but Mr Dolland did ill it rectified and we had a fresh bill—there was no alteration made Mr Fleming s books—it was about lour months ago JANE BAGSHAW My late husband John Bagshaw who died in Oct used to deal with Mr Fleming—he sometimes paid the bills himself—I found this—receipt among his papers read— Mr Bagsliaw to W H Fleming and Co for ale 2l 8s Received for Fleming and Co S Micklebnrgb 4th March 1848 LEOPOLD DELAHAY I was formerly in the service of Mr Baron a customer of Mr Fleming s—on 1st June I paid Mr Mickleburgh 1l 8s for two and a half casks of table ale at the counting-house—he gave me this receipt read— By cash 1l 8s S Mickleburgh THOMAS BRAND FLEMING I am the prosecutor s brother—I attended as his professional adviser at the commencement of this business and it was subsequently handed over to another attorney Cross-examined Q Do you remember the interview which took place between your brother and the prisoner at which you were present A Yes—I suggested that the prisoner should be provided with a solicitor—I do not recollect the prisoner saying after his attention had been called to some of these items which he could not explain there must be an error somewhere what do you propose to do with the errors —it might have been said—after the first examination before the Magistrate an appointment was made by Mr Tucker the prisoner s solicitor to go into the accounts—that was at my father s house at Champion-hill—the books were taken there—I went there—it was postponed at my suggestion to a subsequent day—it did take place a day or two afterwards SAMPSON DARKIN CAMPBELL police-inspector I took the prisoner into custody at Mr Fleming s desire for setting his house on fire—on the way to the station he said he thought the proceedings of Mr Fleming savoured rather of vindictiveness he supposed it arose from a suspicion he entertained of some alleged deficiencies in his accounts Cross-examined Q And he said I think that two or three errors had been pointed out to him by Mr Fleming but he believed he should satisfy him there were no errors he had no doubt A Yes—I was at the fire—I did not see the prisoner there till he was given into custody—he was then wet—the charge of arson was not gone into at all before the Magistrate—Ann Cooper and a person who was on the top of an omnibus were examined and then the case was dismissed—the prisoner accounted for where he was on the 27th—he was taken in custody in front of the premises JOHN WILLIAM

t18510106-401  401 RICHARD GARDNER was again indicted for embezzlement —2nd COUNT for a larceny as servant MR BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution JULIUS HENRY THOMPSON Mr Justice Talfourd read over to Mr Thompson his former evidence to which he assented and proceeded as follows —After June 1850 another book was kept by the prisoner called the balance-book the object of which was to let me know what I had at my bankers every night before I went home—the amount paid to the bankers would appear in that book—in the rough cash-book on 5th Jan last year the sum total carried out into the second column in the prisoner s writing is 120l 3s which it would be his duty to pay into the bank on that day—it consists of twelve items two of them are in his writing 12l 10s and 2l —that is the balance that I desired to be kept and I find that sum put into the balance-book in his writing—one item of it is a check for 7l 16s 1d —it was the prisoner s practice to put on the back of the check the items of which the amount consisted and I find in his writing on the back of this check 100l 3s as the total making a difference of 20l 0s 1d and the amount paid by the bankers book is the same 100l 3s —the prisoner has not accounted to me for the 20l —there are twelve items in the rough cash-book and only seven on the check—some of the items on the check are right and some have been altered COURT Q I suppose the fair cash-book on the side of the moneys received is right A Yes it makes up the 120l —it agrees with the rough cash-book—my attention was first drawn to the alteration of the fair cash-book somewhere about five or six weeks since—that was long after the prisoner had been out of my employ—Mr Waddell had charge of the book in the meantime—he is not here—this 191l on 21st Nov is in the prisoner s writing upon an erasure—I have added it up—it is cast up with the figures as they now appear and the total is in the prisoner s writing—that is not on an erasure in one place it is not an erasure but a tail put to an 0 HENRY VALE TRAPP I was a clerk to Mr Thompson I am not now—this entry of 2s 11d on 2nd June 1850 is in my writing—I received it in the counting-house or collected it and paid it over to the prisoner—the book shows that it was received of Rice and Co —I do not know whether I went to their house to receive it or not—the prisoner kept the rough cash-book—when I went to pay him money he produced it to me at his desk and I made the entry ROBERT WATMORE I am clerk to Messrs Thompson On 3rd Jan 1850 here is an entry in the rough cash-book of 5l 17s and on 4th of 9l 15s in my writing—I received those sums and paid them over to the prisoner HENRY SIMMONS I am clerk to Messrs Thompson—here is an entry in the rough cash-book on 5th Jan of 13l 11s 7d another of 9l 15s another of 7l 16s 1d another of 10l 4s 3d another of 21l 18s 2d and another of 7l 14s 6d all in my writing—I paid them all to the prisoner on that day and I think to the best of my recollection in one sum—it was generally paid about three o clock in the afternoon—it is usually on Saturday when these matters are paid over—we generally come back about two or three from collecting the sums from the merchants—they are freights—we discriminate the parties from whom we receive them THOMAS JAMES OSBORNE I am clerk to Rogers Olding and Co —I produce the book—the amount paid in on 5th Jan 1850 to Mr Thompson s account is 100l 3s William Henry Duncan of Sittingbourne Charles Boyd Surveyor-General of Customs and John Edward Boyd junior son of the latter gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY on 2nd Count — Transported for Seven Years

t18530131-274  274 WILLIAM HAWKINS ADAMS embezzling 4s whilst employed in the Post-office —Other COUNTS for embezzling other sums of 3s and 2s the moneys of Her Majesty s Postmaster General MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution ROBERT THOMAS RANDALL ROBINSON I am a clerk in the employment of Glyn and Co bankers of Lombard-street It was part of my duty to take to the Post-office country bank notes enclosed in an envelope for the purpose of being remitted to our correspondents—I know the prisoner—it was his duty to receive the parcels I so took and to receive the money for the postage—I went with a parcel to the General Post-office on 4th Jan —this produced is the cover of the parcel I then took—I delivered it to the prisoner at the window of the Post-office—I had weighed it before I took it there—it weighed thirty-one ozs —that was marked on it when I delivered it in black ink—I cannot say whether the prisoner weighed it he received it from my hands—I paid him 6s 2d on this parcel—that is not the postage for thirty-one ozs there was an error it ought to have been 5s 2d —I made the error—I bad calculated the postage beforehand—the prisoner requires me to sign a book on my delivering the parcel and he signs a book that I take—this is the book producing it —the entry here on 4th Jan is Bilston 6s 2d —the parcel was directed T Griffin Esq Bilston district bank Wolverhampton THOMAS BIRCH I am a clerk in the London and Westminster bank On 11th Jan I took a parcel of notes to the Post-office—this produced is the envelope of one of the parcels I then took—it is addressed to Mr Rae of Liverpool—I had weighed that parcel before I took it—it weighed fifteen ozs —I marked that on it—the amount of the postage was 2s 8d —I also marked that on it in black ink—I delivered it to the prisoner at the window of the Post-office—I imagine that this mark in red ink is his—I did not see him do it—I paid him altogether 1l 5s 10d —on this parcel I paid him 2s 8d —I did not take any book—I signed a book of his—at the same time I took another parcel of which this produced is the cover—it is addressed S Provis Esq Salisbury —I weighed that—it weighed nineteen ozs —I marked that on the parcel and the amount of postage 3s 4d —both these marks are in black ink—I paid 3s 4d to the prisoner on account of that parcel Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Just look at that fifteen ozs on that envelope and see whether it has not been altered A No it was not originally fourteen or sixteen and altered to fifteen—I think this mark is merely a continuation of the five—the bankers clerks generally go to the Post-office about 3 o clock with their parcels—we generally get there about the same time—I have seen four or five there at one time—I think 3 o clock is about the time of the greatest pressure of business—I cannot say at what time the taking of parcels ceases—I have been as late as a quarter past 3 o clock not later—I speak from my memory as to haying paid these sums of 2s 8d and 3s 4d —I have a book in which I enter the sums before leaving the Bank—I do not take it there with me for the prisoner to sign—I have my book and can show the entry—it is an entry of what I was to pay—I can tell from memory the total sum—I paid a sum on thirteen parcels I think including those—I have no distinct recollection of each particular sum—I paid it all in one sum SAMUEL MARSDEN I am a messenger to Messrs Masterman and Co bankers On the afternoon of 11th Jan I took six bankers parcels to the Post-office—this produced is the cover of one of them—it is addressed to Messrs Bailey of Abergavenny—the weight of the parcel was marked on it by one of the clerks not in my presence it is 23 oz and 4s is marked on it in black ink as the amount of the postage—that was on the wrapper when I took it with the others—I took this book with me producing one the prisoner signed it—the entry is Bailey and Co Abergavenny 4s —that was written by the clerk and signed by the prisoner—I paid the prisoner 15s 6d in the whole—the postage of this parcel was 4s —the prisoner put his name against that after he had received the parcel and the money Cross-examined Q Did you see him sign it A I cannot say that I saw him sign it I saw him writing but I could not see the book the desk being high and the counter low—I am sure he is the person that received the money from me—I knew him MR CLARKSON Q Who handed you the book back after you saw him writing A The prisoner CHARLES JOHN NASH I am a clerk in the General Post-office I know the prisoner as being also a clerk there for many-years—it was his duty to receive bankers parcels at the Post-office they are received between the hours of 3 o clock and 5 o clock every day except Monday—it was the prisoner s duty to take the parcels and to check them to see that the amounts were correct—he was to receive the money and to weigh them to see that the weight marked on them by the bankers was correct—he would then mark the amount of postage on them in red ink—I see the red ink marks on these envelopes that have been produced they indicate the amount of postage—I believe them to be in the prisoner s handwriting—there is no red ink mark of the weight only the amount of postage—the prisoner has a book in which to enter the parcels this produced is it—here is an entry on 4th Jan in the prisoner s handwriting—it is No of the parcel 29 addressed to Thomas Griffin Wolverhampton weight 1 oz postage 2s 2d —there is a number 29 on the parcel that is put there by the prisoner COURT Q Postage 2s 2d for one oz is not that rather dear A That is the entry in the book—that is quite absurd on the face of it MR BODKIN Q On 11th Jan do you find an entry of a parcel addressed to Mr Rae of Liverpool A Yes the number of the parcel is twelve—I find that same number on the envelope that is here in the prisoner s writing —I also find a tax of 2s 8d on the envelope for postage the weight is fifteen ounces—the entry in the book is No 12 G Rae Liverpool 9 ozs 1s 8d that is all in the prisoner s writing—here is an envelope addressed to Mr Provis of Salisbury on the same day—the number on it is 13 the weight nineteen ounces and the charge for postage 3s 4d in the prisoner s writing the entry in the book is No 13 S Provis Sailsbury weight 7 oz postage 1s 4d —here is also an envelope addressed to Messrs Bailey on the same day number sixteen weight twenty-three ounces charge 4s in the prisoner s writing it is entered in his book as No 16 Bailey and Co Abergavenny weight 11 oz postage 2s —that is all in the prisoner s writing—he would have to account to Mr Mellish for the postage he received according to the entries in this book—the alleged receipts on the 4th are cast up in the book each day—the total which he charges himself with having received for parcels on the 4th 1s 5l 12s 10d and on the 11th 5l 8s 6d Cross-examined Q Is there a president whose duty it is to overlook this account to check it and cast it up and compare it with the parcels A To cast it up the president casts it up as it is presented each day—I have not seen him check it with the parcels before they are sent off—I do not know whether that is his duty or not—there is more pressure in the receipt of these parcels at some periods of the day than others the bankers clerks come more together at one portion of the time MR BODKIN Q IS this a part of the Post-office quite separate from the ordinary business A It is a room by itself—the prisoner has no other duty to perform daring this time than to receive these parcels—the Post office enclose these parcels in other covers and address them to the postmasters of the towns to which they go—the prisoner had a clerk to assist him on Tuesdays that is our most busy day—there is nothing on the covers in which the Post-office enclose them indicating the weight or the amount of the postage —Mr Partridge was the president on duty on the 4th and Mr Bourne on the 11th HENRY MELLISH I am one of the window clerks at the Post-office It was the prisoner s duty to account to me for the money he received at the window for the bankers parcels—I have a book in which I enter what I receive referring to it —on 4th Jan I received from him 5l 12s 10d and on 11th 5l 8s 6d for bankers parcels—I made these entries upon those several receipts the entries in the prisoner s book on those dates correspond with mine—he paid me nothing more on either of those days for bankers parcels—I have not cast up the book that is not my duty—the sums I so received were paid over to the revenue Cross-examined Q On 4th Jan there were fifty-six parcels accounted for were there not A I do not know how many I receive the money in a total sum—I do not see the prisoner s book ROBERT PARTRIDGE I am one of the presidents of the Post-office This is the book which it was the prisoner s duty to keep—I have cast up the book and debited the office with the amounts stated—the prisoner casts up the book in the first instance I check it—he has cast this up—I saw that his casting was correct it amounts on the 4th to 5l 12s 10d —I did not do it on the 11th Cross-examined Q On 4th Jan I think there are fifty-six parcels entered A Yes there is a column headed Partner or Clerk —that is signed by the person who brings the parcel HENRY BOURNE I am one of the presidents of the Post-office I was acting as such on 11th Jan last—on that evening the prisoner accounted to me for 5l 8s 6d —it is my business to check the casting of the book—I have done so in this instance—it appeared to have been correctly cast—the bankers clerks have signed it Cross-examined Q There were fifty-nine parcels I think A Yes R T R ROBINSON re-examined I see my name to this entry in the prisoner s book of 4th Jan —it is my signature—I do not remember whether the amount charged for postage was entered when I signed it THOMAS BIRCH re-examined I see my name to this entry on the 11th—I cannot say whether the amount of postage was there at the time I signed it—my name is against Mr Provis s parcel—I have no recollection of seeing the amount of postage charged in that instance Cross-examined Q I suppose the book was put before you and you signed your name and away you went A I signed my name to the number of parcels I left—I cannot say that I looked to see what the entry was—there were thirteen parcels SAMUEL MARSDEN re-examined I see my signature here to the entry on 11th Jan of the parcel to Messrs Bailey—I wrote that at the time I cannot say whether the amount of the postage appeared there at the time I signed this—I have my book which the prisoner signed producing it C J NASH re-examined I see a signature to this entry in Mr Marsden s book on the 11th—I believe it to be the prisoner s writing reads— Six parcels delivered to W H Adams MR ROBINSON re-examined I have a book which was handed up with the parcels on 4th Jan —I did not see any person sign it C J NASH re-examined I see a signature to this entry on the 11th—the entry is Five W H A that is in the prisoner s writing—on the 4th there is an entry of Seven W H Adams that is the prisoner s writing—above that are entered seven bankers parcels and the postage 1l 0s 6d MATTHEW PEAK I am a constable attached to the Post-office I took the prisoner into custody on 20th Jan at the Post-office—Mr Peacock told him in my presence that he was charged with embezzling the postage on bankers parcels and directed me to take him to Bow-street—I took him there and from thence to the Mansion House in a cab—I found 38l 15s 1d on him—as we were going along in the cab he asked me what was to be done with his money—I said it would be in my possession until I received instructions from Mr Peacock to know how it was to be disposed of—he said Because I want some money to employ a solicitor —I said u You can do so by applying to the Lord Mayor —he said I don t think it is necessary it is a clear case and I shall not give the office any trouble —after being examined at the Mansion House he was remanded till the next week—I brought him to Newgate—on the way he said It appears this has been a long time inquiring about —I said Yes so it appears but I know nothing about it neither do I know how it was found out —the prisoner said I can see how it was found out I was in the country some time ago and Mr Nash performed my duties while I was away and they must have seen that his takings must have been about 1l more than mine —he then said This would not have occurred if it had been in the old Presidents time for they always came into the room and examined the parcels by the book but since the present Presidents have been appointed they have not done so —there was an observation made by the Lord Mayor with reference to the amounts in the book when Mr Nash was giving his evidence and the prisoner said Mr Nash did not explain the amounts correctly—he said that to me it was all in a running conversation —he said Mr Nash did not explain the correct amounts because he said eight ounces is considered nine because we don t write the word exceed eight ounces if it exceeds eight ounces it is nine —he said With reference to the thirty-one ounces where there is only one that was a mistake I intended to make it twelve —I was not examined before the Magistrate Cross-examined Q Then this is the first time you have given this evidence in Court A It is I appeared before the Lord Mayor but did not give evidence no deposition of mine was taken—I have not been on terms of personal intimacy with the prisoner—this running conversation took place in coming from the Mansion House and going to Newgate and from Bowstreet to the Mansion House—I have stated what he told me—I have been a witness in 141 Post-office cases—I do not remember anything happening to me when Sir Frederick Thesiger was Attorney-General there was no remark made—it was some representation of yours to the Jury but they did not believe it—I do not remember Sir Frederick Thesiger telling me to stand down and saying he would not act on such evidence—I never had a censure passed upon me—I will not swear it was not said as far as my knowledge goes I am quite certain it did not happen—I did not make any memorandum of this running conversation—I explained to Mr Peacock what the Prisoner said on each occasion as was my duty—I did not state before the Lord Mayor that I could prove this MR CLARKSON Q Was the solicitor of the Post-office there as well as you A Yes—no part of this conversation was after the prisoner s committal—I have been a constable of the Post-office sixteen years and without any complaints—as to what Mr Payne says it is what he stated to the Jury he has a general propensity to run down a witness I have heard you tell him so Richard Williams warehouseman of Friday-street James Norris market gardener of Isleworth and Edward Healey wine and spirit merchant of Islington deposed to the prisoner s good character GUILTY

Jackson for a Bed but they used to eat and drink at my House for which in 5 Days they run up 18 s I saw no Money they had till just before they took Coach and then Bradley gave me 2 Half-Guineas to take my Reckoning out of which I did and returned her 3 s Maccartney fetch d a Coach and he and the 2 Prisoners went in and Bradley bid the Coachman drive to St James s-street directly As it happened I took so much Notice of the Coachman as to know him again he wore a blue Coat he was lame in one Foot and his Shoe was cut to give it Ease About 10 at Night Mrs Jackson came and told me she was robb d and I went next Morning in search after the Coachman and at last I found him at the Saracen s Head in Camomile-street I ask d him to what Place he drove those two Women and the Man he said at first that he did not care to tell me because they had charged him not to let me know if he happened to see me But after a little Talk with him he said Well Master you look like a good honest Man and if you ll give me a Pot I ll tell you I call d for a Pot of Beer and then he told me that when he had carried them a little way they order d him to drive to Billinsgate where they took Water for Greenwich I told Mrs Jackson of this she went with me and we found out the Waterman who carried them and went with him to Greenwich He brought us to the Porter who had help d them to a Lodging Mrs Jackson went to a Justice for a Warrant and as she was coming back Maccartney happened to see her upon which he ran to the Waterside took Oars for London and escaped We went to the Prisoners Room and met with em both We searched em but could find nothing about em that Mrs Jackson could swear to but this Shilling Mrs Jackson I know this Shilling to be Part of the Money that I lost out of my Drawer it looks blackish I suppose it had lain in Gun-powder before I took it I remember I scupled it and made this Scratch to see if it was good and besides here s a little Dent just by the Edge Bradley the Prisoner After I got out of Newgate I met with Holms and we went to a Friend s House and enquired for a Lodging A Woman who was there told us that her Brother Macartney had an Acquaintance who kept an Ale-house in White-Lyon-street by Rag-Fair at which House she believed we might lye but when we came thither there was not Room for us but Mr Baily the Man of the House provided us a Lodging at the Prosecutor s who lived next Door to him Mrs Holms and I had agreed to go to Holland with Capt Allen but while we waited for the Ship s setting Sail we happened to quarrel and she threatned to tell Mrs Jackson that I came out of Newgate upon which I was resolv d to leave that Lodging Court Why did you at first order the Coachman to go to St James s and as soon as you were got out of the Prosecutor s Hearing bid him drive to Billingsgate Bradley Because at first Mrs Holms intended t o go to her Sister in St James s but soon after she chang d her mind and was willing to go with me The Jury acquitted Holms and found Bradley guilty to the Value of 1 s Transportation See summary

such a place he said he would come and look at them I do not think he came in two or three days At last he called at my house I bargain d with him for them likewise I hired a cart in Smithfield and took them to his house in open day-light there were forty of them all but one he paid me for them there were twenty-six wainscot and thirteen or fourteen deal he gave me three pounds eight shillings for them which was about the honest market-price I brought the money to my own house and paid it down to Child and he gave me two shillings for my trouble Child and Hill a Carpenter carried them to that house Hill lives on Saffron-Hill Child has been a rogue all his life-time he is a thief and a robber all the world can tell that he told me he had a very large estate in the Isle of Wight I would have gone through fire and water to have serv d him If any man in court can give me a bad name let him speak it boldly Mason s Defence I know no more of it than the child unborn I never was concerned with Child or ever seen in his company Willoby s Defence I have sufficient evidence to prove I never bought them in hugger-mugger but afterwards put them in publick view they lay about a month in the open yard close up to the gate Q to Prosecutor What are these boards worth Prosecutor I gave two shillings and one penny a piece for them I lost between sixty and seventy Mr Willoby produced this receipt and said he bought a great parcel of deal boards of Guest I ask d him how he could think them honestly come by out of an empty house of a poor journeyman frame maker I ask d him also whether he had such a receipt from every timber yard where he dealt he made me no sort of answer but said he did not like it at the time he bought them and he believed Guest was a rogue or something like it For Willoby Thomas Plowman I have work d for Mr Willoby about ten months he has about five journeymen I remember the wainscot was brought in about two o clock at noon in an open cart and placed on each side the gate not a yard from the street and we did not work up any or remove them till about a month or two or better after we had no order to conceal them nor no such attempts made we work d up some of them and removed them into the dry place fearing the wet Q How long have you known Mr Willoby Plowman I have known him about two years he always bore a good character he carries on business publick as other people do and has a great trade Q Was you at work when Mr Coker came to see the boards Plowman I was Q Where did they lie then Plowman Some were working up and some were lying by Q Did you see him come a second time Plowman I did Q In what manner were they lying then Plowman In the same manner as before when he came first Q Were there none mixed among them Plowman No there were not I am very sure of that Q to Prosecutor Are you sure there had been an alteration betwixt the first and second time of your seeing them there Prosecutor There had some of them were moved from where I first saw them and other boards of the same sort put amongst them and the men plaining them over Willoby said they were boards that he bought of a man in Shoreditch Plowman There were none at all mix d with them Mr Coker said they should not be touch d and they were not touch d nor stirr d till he came again but when he found we were planing the other boards he said you rogues you ought to be taken up for plaining my boards all these boards are mine when the others had been come in not above two hours Prosecutor They were plaining their own boards and mixed some of them with mine in order to puzzle me and make me swear to some that were not my own Thomas Brian I work with Mr Willoby I remember these wainscot boards that Mr Coker challenged I handed them out of a cart and up to the gable end of the house they were brought about two o clock in the afternoon and placed on both sides the gate and remained there several days We removed them because of the wet weather coming on I remember Mr Coker pitching upon some of them there was no other oak along with them and the second time of his coming there were none mixed with them the other boards came from Shoreditch I went and brought some of them home Q How long have you known Mr Willoby Brian I have known him nine months Q Had you any particular directions in order to conceal the boards Brian No I was the person that contrived that place to put them in from the wet I remember Guest came along with the boards I cannot tell whether he sold them to my master or not Richard Goucher Mr Willoby employ d me to make four swifts for Weavers Mr Guest came to me and told me he had some very good stuff to dispose of I believe Mr Willoby bought them for I us d part of them the latter end of January and beginning of February I saw them standing out open at the upper end of Brick-lane I advis d him to take them in I could not work them they had stood so long in the wet we differ d about them and I made no more for him I work at my own home and he found stuff Q Was Guest a dealer in timber Goucher Yes I have bought of him he is a Carpenter To his character Humphry Haydon Esq I have known Willoby four or five years he has been doing business for me and acted very fairly and honestly I employ d him to sell my goods his character is very good Aaron Lamb Esq I have known Willoby about ten years he is a very honest man for a dealing man I believe he would do any thing in the world rather to detect a thief than encourage one Mr Roberts I have known him eight or ten years I never heard any thing to his prejudice in my life an honest industrious man I look upon him in that light Robert Plumpton I have known him ten or fifteen years I never knew or heard to the contrary but that he is a very honest industrious man Samuel Worrel Esq I have known him eight or nine years he had always an honest good character I look upon him to be a man of substance Mr Darking I have known him upwards of two years

being aiding abetting and assisting the said Guest and Henfield in committing that Felony March 24 ++ Mark Hammel I am one of the Church-Wardens of Stepney Parish we had about eleven hundred weight of lead stolen off our church about the twenty-second or twenty-third of March last James How I am servant to Mr Darking one of the Church-Wardens of Stepney I remember there were some lead missing from off the church about two months ago it was missing on a Wednesday morning and the Friday after that I had been in Bishopsgate-street I saw a sand-cart near the Green-Dragon a little after five in the morning I observ d it to go over to Mrs Smith s a Plumber a little before seven I look d into it and saw some lead in it like sheet-lead that had been us d in covering some house there was some litter and yellowish stuff like hay and dung among it then I went home and told my master of it Joseph Darking I am one of the Church-Wardens of the parish of Stepney I receiv d information from the last evidence concerning this lead which he had seen in Bishopsgate-street I went to Bishopsgate-street and went in at Mrs Smith s there at the farther end of the shop I found a large quantity of lead I said we have had our church at Stepney robb d and you have bought some lead this morning and I am one of the Church-Wardens I took up three pieces and found some spikes in it she told me it was gutter lead and she had bought it of some Carpenters that lived towards Old-street names John Child and John Guest I went to Mr Alderman Cokayne and told him our church had been robb d and I had found the lead in Bishopsgate-street which and he sent for a Plumber who came and inspected it his name is William Walker William Walker I am a Plumber on the twenty-third of March last I was sent for to the shop of Mrs Smith in Bishopsgate-street by order of Mr Alderman Cokayne he told me Stepney Church had been robb d and desir d me to look at that lead and give him my opinion of it I saw it and said it certainly came from off a flat place I measur d and weigh d it there was eleven-hundred one quarter and eleven pounds of it twenty-eight pieces in all Then I went to the Church and measur d there and took a remarkable piece to compare I found it of the same thickness with that on the Church there was one spike in it and holes where four had been I found where it was taken from and observed the spike in the lead exactly fitted to a hole in the timber and the four holes answered to four holes in the rasters I compared one of the small nails that I took out of Mrs Smith s shop with one remaining on the Church and they answered exactly in size shape and demension I observ d a spike-nail remaining on the Church which had not been drawn when the lead was taken up it tallied with the lead when we came to put it on as well as two indentures could there was no room to doubt but that the lead came from that place Cross examination Q What is the value of that lead Walker If it had been brought and offer d to me and honestly came by I should have given 13 s per hundred for it as old lead to melt down I had given more than that at that time Counsel We have now prov d the lead found in Mrs Smith s house was the lead taken from off the church at Stepney we will next mention a circumstance of finding tools and mussatees on the Church and the prisoners meeting Q to Mr Hammel

freely of twopenny and beer about two hundred yards from the church I was not agreeable to it Q What was mentioned Child It was to take the lead from the church We left a shilling to bind us to come

walk d round and took a view of the church when we came at the back-part of the church Guest toss d up a stone upon the church and said he wanted to know whether the lead was found which Mrs Gillingham took notice of and got some wind of it In a day or two after that all sides were agreed Guest lived in my neighbourhood within about three or four hundred yards of me Henfield and Mason lived at a distance Q Had you ever talk d to either of them about taking this lead Child Yes it was talk d of and agreed to by all I met Guest and Mason at Henfield s house Henfield was there also There was only the maid-servant at home besides but she heard nothing of what we talk d about Q Give an account of the conversation Child We appointed to meet in Stepney church-yard and fix d upon the time which I think was the next night Q Who were to meet Child Guest Henfield a servant of Mrs Smith s Mason and me but Henfield was not to come till three o clock in the morning and we were to be there by between nine and ten at night We were to get a ladder and get upon the church and get as much lead as we could till it came to grow light and Henfield was to come to us by three in the morning to help us as much as possible in carrying it away it being a hard job We had agreed this at Henfield s house to carry and bury it in a dunghill about a quarter of a mile from the church till such time as we could get it away to Mrs Smith s house Q Had you had any conversation with Mrs Smith about it at that time Child No I had not Q What is the name of Mrs Smith s servant Child I do not

made by Mrs Smith s servant but it did not do well so we throw d it by Q Who brought the other knife chissel and pincers Child Guest did I had another knife in my pocket which I used Q How much lead do you think you took away Child I did not think it to be so much as it prov d to be I took it to be about a thousand weight Q How did you let it down Child There was but one piece tried to be let down by that rope all the other pieces where toss d down it was soft ground and the fall made no great noise Guest had on a pair of mittens that is knit gloves and a pair of green mussatees Q Look at this mitten here produc d Child He takes it in his hand This is one of Guest s I believe Q Look at these green mussatees He takes them in his hand Child These are the same he had on Mr Darking I found this odd mitten and these mussatees on the top of the church the day after it was robb d Q Was Henfield as good as his word Child He was He came about three in the morning We had then just got the lead down and begun to carry it away to the dunghill and Henfield assisted us in carrying it away where we covered it over Q Was it light or dark Child It was star-light we had no lanthorn we had finished when the people were going a milking about four o clock Q How long did the lead lie in the dunghill Child It lay there two days and one night Q Which way did you all come home Child We all parted as soon as we came into the road and went to our homes Q Where was the next meeting Child That was at Henfield s house the same day in the afternoon Guest and I call d there Mason was not there Guest and I went to the dunghill to see that it was cover d safe Q Who was I the taking it away from the dunghill Child Guest and I got a cart in Old-street and we went and fetch d it into Bishopsgate-street to Mrs Smith s Q What did you do with the ladder afterwards Child We took that away and carried it within about twenty yards from the place where we had it and some people were coming down the road so we laid it down and left it there Q What time was the lead carried to Mrs Smith s Child We got there about seven in the morning with it She paid me for it and I gave her a receipt The money she gave me was five 27 s pieces The receipt was for 6 l 15 and I carried the money to Henfield as was agreed upon before and there it was divided by him He made the charges out and when they were paid we had about 24 s each that is Henfield Guest Mrs Smith s servant Mason and me I had 6 s 6 d to pay for the horses and the cart and the rest was all spent 8 s 6 d I believe The rope we tied to an iron bar in the window of the church to get down by and the last person that came down could not untie that so we left it hanging that was John Guest The ladder was not high enough to get upon the top of the church we put it upon a grave-stone and got upon the lower part of the church and from thence to the upper part We drew up the ladder after us Cross Examination Q Whether the first time you were examined before Mr Fielding you did not say that Henfield and Mrs Smith s servant went out in the afternoon the day before the lead was sold to show you where the lead was hid Child I was ordered what to say I would never have told the truth I would sooner have died had I not been told by Henfield s brother they were striving every way to throw it upon me Q Was the Plumber s man one in the consultation about going Child He was one in the consulting of it Q Did your ever give any account that you bought this lead of some rope-makers Child No we did agree if it should be blow d to say so Q When did you divide the money Child I can t say the day I think it was on a Friday It was the same day that we brought it to Mrs Smith s Mr Hammel I remember Henfield s being apprehended I can t tell the day of the month I think he was before Child was brought from the country and Mason s son was apprehended instead of the father we at that time did not know there were two Masons father and son when we came before Justice Fielding young Mason declared his innocence he and Henfield were brought there together the Justice was going to commit young Mason for farther examination Henfield desired to be heard saying he had something to say by himself when the room was cleared of the common people Henfield said they had taken the wrong person let it turn how it will the suddle ought to lie on the right horse for that it was not young Mason but Peter Mason the father of him I and two others that are here were by and heard this We endeavoured directly to get the father and he was taken and brought in about a couple of hours After he came into the room I went up to Henfield and thank d him for leading us out of the mistake I ask d him if he could say any more he said he could and he would and seem d willing then but the next morning he would not say any thing Cross Examination Q At the time that he made use of this expression Let it happen how it will the saddle ought to be laid on the right horse whether he did not insist upon it that he was innocent himself Hammel I really think he could not insist upon that Q How did you get Mason Hammel By sending a warrant to his house but I was not there James Holland I was one that the justice sent to take up Mason when we went to his house we found he had did himself I ask d his daughter where he was she said he was not in the way and had been gone out ever since the morning we went to a publick house opposite to his house and waited we saw his wife come home after which he went out of his own house

another woman that belong d to Guest she was big with child by him Q What had you for dinner Tasker We had pork part boil d and part roasted after dinner we took a walk into the church-yard in walking round among the tombs Guest threw up a stone upon the church I heard him say let us see if the lead is found or words to that effect there came a person out and said Don t throw up stones to break the windows for you will not be willing to pay for them Q Do you know Mason Tasker I never saw him till I saw him in Westminster Gate-house I have heard Child speak of him Q Was Henfield along with you Tasker No he was not Cross Examination Q Do you remember any conversation between Child and you in March Tasker I was in bed he came to me on the twenty-fourth of March between eleven and twelve at night I said what makes you be here at this time of night he said because I dare not go home I said what is the reason of that he said there was some lead that he and Guest had bought the day before and he imagin d it was stolen I ask d him how he came to know it was stolen he said the Plumber came and said Mr Child was there not two shillings betwixt my wife and you about the lead he ask d him to go and drink together at the next house and he would go before and call for the beer and he imagin d they had an officer in the publick house to take him Q Where did he say this was Tasker He said it was in Bi shopsgate-street he said he saw a man at the door with a paper in his hand and they set off one one way and the other the other way and would not go into the house he told me he bought the lead of two men that appear d to be Rope-makers for they had hemp about their cloaths Guest s Defence I ll tell the whole truth I was at work at Child s house I cannot tell the day of the month as I was going away about three in the afternoon said he I wish you would go along with me to-morrow morning I have bought some lead as far off as Stepney and I shall want a hand to help to get it home

but you must pay more money said Child I shall not stick for trifles said he I shall want them between two and three to-morrow morning and if I shall not want them at that time I ll send this man to forbid it he call d me at three the next morning out of my bed and said it was half an hour past two I got up we went to Old-street and it was a quarter past three before we had the horses and cart

afternoon I deliver d the money to Henfield as I went by with the cart about eight o clock the lead was sold about seven and it was not divided till the afternoon on the same day Q from Henfield What

knowing it to have been stolen June 7 ++ Hance Newsham I am a publican at King James s Stairs Shadwell I missed my tankard about five in the afternoon on the seventh of June out of my top-room I found the two prisoners Leegroves and Bailis and Richard Eaton drinking in the tap-room they had a tankard of beer and some gin I observed the tankard it was a particular fashioned one it stood upon the bench by the side of the prisoners I happened to have occasion to go out when I came back again the prisoners were gone and very soon after the waiter missed the tankard there were several other companies of people in the tap room but there were nobody but these people in that box where the tankard was I took the prisosoners next morning they plied at the stairs near my house Q Did they appear publickly about their business Newsham Yes Bailis in particular came into the house I suppose they had had some information that I was after them and so chose to put the best countenance on it and shew themselves I thought they were all in liquor John Wrist I live with Mr Newsham Bailis and Eaton came in first between eleven and twelve o clock and called for a pint of beer they drank that and then they called for a tankard I told them the tankards I believed were all engaged they complained of that and said D - n you or b - t you we will drink in silver as well as another our money is as good as another s Finding them uneasy I got them a tankard they drank two tankards of beer Groves came in either about the latter end of the first or the beginning of the second he drank part of the beer with them the tankard was afterwards missed in the way my master has given an account of Q Do you think they were in liquor Wrist I do not think they were David Stevens I am an apprentice to Mr Newsham I took the reckoning of these people about half an hour past three o clock they put their money down on the table at that time I did not see the tankard I had seen it about two o clock I remember one went out a little before the rest in order to stow their boats as I understood Ashur Hart The two prisoners Groves and Eaton came to my house one Friday afternoon before our sabbath about a month ago and wanted me to buy some plate I refused to look at it so I don t know what it was I live in St Catharine s I keep a shop and sell silver Richard Eaton Bailis and I went into the prosecutor s house to have some beer about eleven o clock on Friday the first of June we had five pots of beer some in a tankard with a lid and two or three half pints of gin one of us put the tankard on the bench by him when the gin was on the table and Bailis put it in his pocket then he went out with pretence of stowing his boat and carried the tankard to his father s we paid our reckoning and then went away Bailis went first and we followed him to his father s Bailis unlocked the door went up and brought the tankard down Then we went away to Ashur Hart and asked him to buy some plate he said he had been in trouble before and would not meddle with it but he gave us something to drink then we took a boat and went over to Rotherhithe to a man we thought would do it for us he said he never did such things and gave us a direction to a man in Dukes-Place or Petticoat-lane or thereabout we went back to St Catharine s went through the Minories and so to Petticoat-lane or Dukes-Place I can t say certainly the place we went to the place we had been directed to but could not find the man from thence we went down to one Daniel Thomas s in Denmark-street Ratcliffe-highway and enquired for one Judith Cassandra she sent Ann Davis with Groves to shew him a fence * he returned again and brought two pounds eleven shillings and six-pence and said that was the money the tankard came to one of the prisoners said we would satisfy Cassandra and Davis gave them three shillings and then divided fifteen shillings a piece which was just the amount of the money Groves had nothing but his jacket on whilst he was at Newsham s but afterwards put on Bailis s coat and had the tankard in Bailis s great coat pocket till it was carried out to this fence * A cant word for a person that buys stolen goods Ann Davis I live in Denmark-street I was acquainted with this Judith Cassandra she came to me on the sixth of June she told me there was a man had a warrant against her I let her be at my house Eaton came in and asked for the old woman I never saw him before she asked me if I would be true to her then she told me that these three men had been dragging for a dead man and had got this tankard and wanted me to go to a person to assist them in disposing of it and directed me where to find out Lyons Groves went with me to Dukes Place there I found Lyons Groves asked him if he bought such and such things he said he did he asked him what he gave an ounce he said three shillings and six-pence but he said he did not mind for another six-pence we walked about through several turnings till we got into Bishopsgate-street there we went up into Sweet-apple court we went into a public house and they gave me two-pence to buy some beer while the Jew and he went away they staid about twenty minutes then they came back again and the Jew paid two pounds twelve shillings sixpence was dededucted for the liquor the money was two guineas four shillings a five and three-penny piece and

said ship —Other COUNTS for attempting to make a revolt in the ship MESSRS BODKIN and POLAND conducted the Prosecution WALTER BOLITHO I was a seaman on board the Stebonheath I did not go out in her I joined her at Melbourne—she was an English ship belonging to the port of London—I went on board on the 29th Jan in the present year—the prisoner also shipped as a seaman on board the vessel—he joined at Melbourne about a fortnight after I had joined—I never saw him before he joined the ship he was on board two or three days before we sailed—we sailed on 17th Feb —the crew consisted of about thirty-two altogether—I cannot say the number of passengers exactly there were upwards of twenty twenty or twenty-five I think—there were some women—we had a large quantity of gold on board it was said to be two tons and a half—on the morning of the 18th I was at the wheel from 8 to 10 o clock—while I was there the prisoner came on the poop to do some work—he asked me if I would like to have charge of this here meaning the poop putting his foot on the deck—I did not make him any answer—nothing more passed at that time—on the evening of the same day I was on the look-out in the forecastle heads from 8 to 10 o clock—the prisoner came there—he asked me if I had been to Callao or on the coast of Peru—I said No I never was round that part—he said I have been a long time knocking about there I have been under the Peruvian government at the time they were at war with the Chilians I thought to make a d—fine thing of it for when I joined I agreed to have forty-eight hours plunder after we took the town we went up at 12 o clock at night and began to fire on the town we fired too high and they took the steamboat from us we were all took ashore and allowed 6d a day for eleven weeks thinking that we should join their service when they found we would not join they stopped our money and twenty of us went down the river and joined the Peruvian service again we took a canoe there was a man and two women in it we made them get out and proceeded down the river and joined the Peruvians again in another steamboat —he said We were lying at anchor at 12 o clock at night and the soldiers on board being mostly Chilians took the steamboat from us I was asleep on the quarter deck when one of the English sailors came to me and awoke me and told me that she was in the hands of the soldiers I then got up to try to get for ard but the sentry aft stopped me I then being able to talk Spanish got over the sentry aft I then got for ard and the sentry for ard stopped me from going down I then got over the sentry and got below when I got down below I found them all asleep I awoke them wanting for them to try to take the ship back again they asked me how I was going to manage it I said You have plenty of ammunition and I will go up and shoot the sentry aft and when you hear the report of the pistol shoot the sentry for ard when I got aft I found them plundering the cabin there was a writing desk which I knew to be the captain s I took the butt end of a musket and broke it open there were fourteen ounces dropped out and I picked up seven out of it I then fired and shot the sentry and them for ard hearing the report of the pistol fired at the sentry for ard but missed him and did not try it again next morning we was took ashore and shoved in chokey —that is a nautical term for in prison — we thought we should have been shot but we were only made well fast I and twenty more broke out of prison then took a schooner lying above the fort and battened all hands below and slipped the cable and passed the fort very nicely until we came to the guard ship they hailed us I answered them in Spanish we were ordered down to the mouth of the river and next morning we had a nice offing we fell in then with two small craft coming back from selling their cargo we hoarded them and took their money and sank the vessels we then went on the coast of California thinking to meet some of the money vessels coming up the coast we were there three weeks before we fell in with one we boarded her and found she had 7 000 ounces of gold on board we took the gold and served her the same fete as the two vessels before we then came to Callao after that we lost the schooner on the reefs but saved the money I and two or three more then shipped for England and arrived in London and then came out here meaning Port Philip—he then asked me how I would like to be at that game—I said it would do very well if I could always get clear—he then said It will be a go if we are pressed or taken by the Russians it will be a d—fine prize two tons or two tons and a half of gold how would you like to go shares with it yourself —I said I should like if very well but that will never come to pass —he said It could be done very easy if you will only stick to me I will have it before forty-eight hours for I have come on board on purpose for it what do you say it must be done and shall be done that is the word stamping his foot upon the deck—I said to him I did not think it could be done—he said Who is there here that you care about there is nothing here but a lot of old b—s that ought to have been out of this world long ago —I then asked him bow he was going to manage it—he said There is not a man in the forecastle that will refuse a glass of grog give them a dose and they will not know of it and we will put them all right the look-out we will pass him overboard and then we will cut the back rope go aft and ask the second mate the officer of the watch to come for ard and serve him the same as the look-out and they are settled with out any more noise —he then asked me if I was frightened to take a life—before that he said There is no one but the boatswain and the carpenter then to fear about a small bit of steel will settle them —he then said Are you frightened to take a life —I said I never have done it yet —he said I won t ask you to do that I will do all that myself do you think another one would do better so as to have one on each side of the deck —I said Yes —he said Who can you pick on —I picked on a man of the name of Whittington it being his next look-out to relieve me—I did not tell him that Whittington was the next look-out but I picked upon Whittington because it was his next look-out—before this passed about Whittington he said After the captain and mate is out of the way we will then go aft and haul up the ladder and lay it across the hatch so as no one can come up from below I know who sleeps in every berth and where the arm chest is and I will load everything in the arm chest and then tell the passengers that the ship is in the hands of the crew and they will think all hands are in it then I will go into the rooms and pick them off as I want them —he said be would shoot the captain and mate and he should have twelve shots left after he had shot them—I asked him if he would kill the women too—he said Only the old women we will keep the young ones until we get on the coast of Peru and when we get the gold in the boat we will scuttle the ship and let the women go down with her we can then bury the gold in the sand and we can either go to the Salt Lake or take the steamboat to Panama and then we are all right it is only a bold stroke and it is ours as easy as anything —he then began with Whittington—four bells struck and Whittington came—during this long talk I drank twice with the prisoner it was brandy—the prisoner had it he get it from a keg standing on the forecastle head where we were standing—he took it out of that—when Whittington came up the prisoner said to him We shall be a fine prize for the Russians to fall in with Tom —that was the first thing he said to him—he gave Whittington a pannikin of brandy and said How would you like to have your share in it —Whittington drank the brandy and it made him sick and he said D—it that is brandy sure enough —he said Yes that is the real stuff —Whittington said if we were taken by the Russians be would volunteer until we fell in with a British man-of-war or else we should get cooked—the prisoner then said to Whittington What do you say will you join there is a way of getting of it if you will only stick to me I will sign the contract with my heart s blood what do you say to that Tom will you join for there was never a better ship came out of Melbourne or Hobson s Bay that will be easier took for when the captain and mate is out of the way I will have charge of the ship in ten minutes —he said There is not a man in the forecastle that will refuse a glass of grog is there —Tom said No —he said With some stuff I can give them a dose and she won t know of it they won t get over it just directly —Whittington asked me what I thought of it—I said I did not think it could be managed —the prisoner asked Whittington how many he wanted to join—he said Not lees than half a dozen —the prisoner laid Who can you depend upon —Whittington said Not one —he said It has got to be done and it must be done for I have come on board on purpose for that and nothing else and the sooner it is done the better for the ship shall never take me round the Horn nor neither to London —he said I shall load my revolvers to-morrow and I shall not unload them until they hare done execution —he said to Tom You load yours but clean it first you need not be frightened at a pistol you have been in the Ballarat riots —Whittington said he was no more frightened of a pistol than he was—the prisoner said he knew that and that was the reason he put it to him—he said we would get the gold in the boat and bury it in the sand—he told the same to Whittington as what he had told to me and after the gold was buried in the sand he would scuttle the ship—eight bells then struck and we separated—on the following morning Tuesday 19th Whittington and I were on watch together on deck from 4 o clock to 8 and we had some talk together about this the prisoner was not there—he was in the same watch till we went below—I had no talk with the prisoner till we went below—that was from 8 o clock to 12—we were then off watch—he was then kneeling over his hunk after breakfast he beckoned to me and I went there—he took out two revolvers and said What do you think of them I —there were six barrels to each revolver—there were also two single barrelled pistols and two daggers and two or three small bottles—when he asked me what I thought of them I said they were stunners—I said I see you are well prepared for it —he said By G— they have never deceived me yet and they are not going to do it either I am a dead shot with either of these pistols —he showed me how the pistols worked—he said I can discharge every one of these barrels as quick as I can Work my finger —I then saw him feed the pistols—he loaded them with balls—in some barrels he put two halls and in some one—he did not load them all—I only saw him load the two six-barrelled revolvers—I did not see him load the single pistols I do not know whether they were loaded—lie then put them into his bag and put it into his bunk where he slept—it does not shut down or shut up in any way it stands about five feet off the deck—I asked him what was in them bottles—he said Ton can judge and carefully put them back again into the bag—I saw that the bottles were full of something it was a liquid—in the course of that day one of the crew went to the boatswain for some spun yarn—he gave it him and said he must be very careful of it for they must soon begin to make some—the prisoner laid to me Do you hear that if he lives to see any span yarn made I am deceived —on the following day Wednesday 20th the prisoner came to me as I was coming from the wheel and said he was frightened that Whittington would have nothing to do with it but b—him we will get his revolver and then we don t care whether he joins or not we will talk it over in the next watch we can settle Whittington don t you think you and I can manage it —I said No —he said I will go and sound Jonathan meaning a seaman of the name of Hugh Kent who went by the name of Jonathan—he then went over to Kent who was on the other side of the deck and had some conversation with him which I did not hear—while he was with Kent Whittington went over to him he came back and said that they had some brandy there and the prisoner had asked him to have some after that the prisoner came over and said It is all right I find he is staunch as a piece of iron and we don t care whether Whittington jobs or not now what do you say now for to-morrow night we are far enough to the south ard she is just under the canvas I want that will do all the way to the coast of Peru there could not be a better time they are all sick in the cabin I hope you are not funking upon it we will have it tomorrow night —I said no I was not funking on it—he said That is right for I have got everything ready everything prepared —he said You are not frightened of a pistol I have stood before four armed men and told them to stand and made them deliver up everything they had got and they were glad to get away with their lives —I asked him where about was that and he said it was on the Avoca diggings—I asked him how long he had been out here—he said Four years but I have been in England since —after this I asked him what he had in the bottles—he said it was laudanum and mentioned some other stuff which I forget the name of—he said that he would put that in the brandy and that would make all hands quiet enough—with this brandy he was going to have a birthday and the laudanum and the other stuff he was going to put in this and hocus the crew for ard—he said There is Jack Long Jem Phillips and Harry Bluff we will give them an extra dose so as to make sure of them —on the following evening Thursday the 21st I was on the look-out on the forecastle end from 6 to 8 o clock—the prisoner came up to me and said Well my chief officer what do think of it now T—I said As much as ever I did —he said What do you say for to-morrow night there can t be a better time and we are far enough to the south ard —I told him that he had better leave it alone altogether for I should have nothing at all to do with it—he then said I would as soon go down now and shoot myself as not it is Whittington that has been persuading you off it —I said No I wanted no persuasion —he said I will be revenged on him if it had not been for you and Tom she would have been in my hands long before this all that I am sorry fat is that ever I spoke to a soul on board —he then said If I can depend on you and Whittington she shall be in my hands before Saturday morning at 4 o clock or else I will be a corpse in that cabin I have been stopping on shore six weeks waiting for the Hong Kong escort but as there was no gold shipped for China I took this being the first chance —Whittington was not present at this conversation—when I came off the lookout at 8 o clock I told Whittington to look out for himself and told him what had passed between me and the prisoner—on the Friday morning I saw the captain and mate and made a disclosure of this Whittington went first and reported it to the mate and then we were both called in together to the captain—it was on the Thursday evening that I had the last talk with the prisoner I came off the look-out at 8 o clock and saw Whittington that same night I think it was from 12 to 4 o clock—it was about 9 o clock on Friday morning that I saw the captain Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q You joined I think you told us about a fortnight before the prisoner A I cannot say exactly about that the ship was not loading the gold at that time it was loaded two or three days before she sailed—it was the prisoner that told me there was two tons and a half on board that was on the Monday after we sailed—I did not know before that how much gold there was on board—I had seen the gold coming on board about two or three days before she sailed I cannot say to a day I lent a hand to take it on board—I think it all came on board the same day I am not sure—the prisoner and I were strangers we had never seen each other before we joined this ship—I had been a sailor before—I had sailed in ships with gold in them before—I came home in a ship with gold once before I do not know what else was in it—it was on the Monday after we sailed that the prisoner first spoke to me—we left Port Philip on the Sunday—I had conversed with him before but Monday was the first time he spoke about this matter—all he said that morning was How would you like to be master here putting his foot on the poop it was on the evening of the same day that this long conversation took place—I have been examined before the Magistrate on this charge—he told me of his having fallen in with a schooner having 7 000 ounces on board and that they scuttled the ship—he said The dead tell no tales —he did not say they had murdered the passengers and crew I understood that they were sunk with the vessel and drowned—I did not tell him anything about what I had done—I did not say that I had run away with a British ship that had 700l worth of jewellery on board I swear that nothing of the sort I did not tell him anything—I had no revolver I swear that nor any gunpowder nothing of the kind—my bunk was not searched Q On this Monday night when he told you what the plan was how many persons did you understand were to be murdered in the course of it t A I did not know he was going to kill all hands forward and he was going to shoot them aft—those forward were to be focussed he was going to give them a dose that would make them quiet enough those aft were to be killed and those forward first drugged with laudanum and then thrown overboard—I cannot say what the boatswain s name is most likely he is here I have not seen him to-day—I do not know the man s name that went for the spun yarn he is not there—it was on the Thursday that the prisoner addressed me as his chief officer—it had not been arranged at all that I was to be chief officer nothing of the sort had been said before then—I had said that it would require a good scholar to navigate the ship—I think I said that on the Monday night when he was talking to Whittington—Whittington said I could do that but we shall never be strong enough Whittington told him he must see his way clearly before he went in—I did not say that we wanted more help—I swear that—I did not mention to any person what the prisoner had said to me between the Monday night and the Friday morning—I was present on the Wednesday night when the conversation took place between Whittington and the prisoner—it was then that the observation was made about Jonathan—I was called away to go to the wheel I did not hear all that passed—Whittington said it would be better to leave it alone that he would have nothing to do with it I did not stop after that—I cannot say what the answer was—there was a good deal passed that I cannot recollect—I saw Whittington s revolver it was kept in his chest before it was taken aft—there were a good many on board that had revolvers either a single one or else a revolver a good many diggers coming down from the diggings—I told the prisoner on the Thursday even-ing that he had better not do it—I did not tell him so till then—I was very much shocked when he proposed this to me—I did not tell him so—I did not say there was not enough of us to do it not at any time I am sure of that—when I went and made a communication to the captain the prisoner was at the wheel—the ship was then under sail—the bag which the prisoner had was in his bunk it was tied the place was not locked there was nothing to prevent any one going to it—the prisoner had been at the wheel about an hour when I went to the captain or when Whittington went when we were both called in at 9 o clock he went there at 8—I never told Whittington in the prisoner s presence that I had taken 700J worth of jewellery out of a British ship—that I swear nothing of the sort—I and Whittington had not known each other before we joined the ship—the prisoner showed me how his revolver worked I have had one in my hand before but never used one or had one—I have been at the diggings at Mount Blackwood that is in Victoria district—I was there nine months this last time—I had not been there before I bad been at Bendigo—I was there about nine weeks—those were the only two diggings I had been to—I was working there in partnership there was a company of nine of us at Mount Black wood—at Bendigo I had one partner a sailor man named John Richardson—that was four years ago—I went by the name of Bolitho there and also at Blackwood—I can show you my miner s license to prove it I have not got it with me—my father was a Cornish man—I know what the eye blight is I have seen a good many with it it is generally more on the roads than it is on the diggings I mean in walking on the road from so much dust flying—dysentery is very common there—the miners do not take laudanum and water for it I never saw it taken or applied to the eye and never heard of it I generally saw eye blight cured with lump sugar—I do not know what they use for dysentery I have seen some with dysentery—I never saw any laudanum used for it—I do not know that the miners many laudanum with them for the purpose both of the eye blight and dysentery there are plenty of doctors shops on the diggings—I do not know what they get for it—that I swear—I have never heard of it as opium I have heard tell of laudanum but do not know at all what it is used for—I never heard tell of its being used on the diggings for dysentery or eye blight or to put in the water to drink MR BODKIN Q You have been asked whether you were not very much shocked at the proposal that was made to you and you say Yes A Yes—I did not say so—Whittington wanted to go aft but I said You had better hold on till you find out what stuff he has got in them bottles —I never intended to join in this on my oath THOMAS WHITTINGTON I was a seaman on board the Stebonheath I joined at Melbourne the day before Bolitho—I had not known Bolitho before joining the ship—we sailed on Sunday the 17th—on the following day I relieved Bolitho at the look-out at 10 o clock at night—he remained on the forecastle after I relieved him the prisoner was there and he remarked that it would be a fine prize for the Russians to fall in with—I said laughing Yes and that I would volunteer till we fell in with a British man-of-war or else we should get cooked—the prisoner said Here is a nice pile here how would you like your share of it at the same time he held a pannikin and told me to take a robber—I drank and it made me quite sick and almost took my breath away—I said D—it that is brandy sure enough —he said Yes that is the real stuff he then asked me again how I should like a share of it and told me there was two tons on board—he did not say particularly of what but he was speaking of money or gold and there was a way of getting it—he said There are three of us and if you two will stick to me I will sign the contract with my heart s blood —I then asked Bolitho what he thought of it—he said he did not think it could be done— No says I I must see clearly before me before I go in —I then told Lewis that we were not strong enough—he asked me how many we wanted—I said Not less than half a dozen — Well said Lewis it has got to be done I am prepared and came on board for nothing else and he swore that he would never go round Cape Horn or to London in her—he said I could do it alone but it is too much for one by G—we will have it without a soul for ard knowing about it I will be master of the cabin in fire minutes —he then told me to drink again and rise my spirits—I told him I must hare some water with it if I did and be asked Bolitho to fetch some water some water was brought and he mixed it and I drank—after I had drunk Lewis asked me what I said about it—I told him that I would like it if he would show me clearly how we could go about it— Well says he there was never a better ship ever come out of Hobson s Bay and there is not a man in that forecastle that will refuse a glass of grog is there —I said No — Well says he with this brandy and some stuff I will put in it I will give them a dose they will sleep and not recover just directly you have got a revolver and I have plenty of arms I will give Watty meaning Bolitho one revolver and you stand in one gangway and him in the other and if any one stirs shoot them —I then asked him where would the look-out be—he said Oh he is soon settled and then we can tell the second mate that the back rope or something is gone for ard he will come for ard looking over and we will pitch him off and all them is settled without the least noise I will then go aft I know who sleeps below where the arm chest is and the captain and mate I will settle them quietly it is time they were in hell long ago I will then haul up the ladder from below so as they cannot come up and tell the passengers the ship is in the hands of the crew if they come out I will shoot them for I am a dead shot —he laid he would then have command of all— As for the women he said we will save them till we scuttle the ship you can run her down to the coast of Peru and then get into the boat get on shore and bury it for a bit in the send —Watty made a remark then that it would want a good scholar—I said That I can do I can run her down there —Lewis then-asked me if I would join—I told him I would let him know on the next watch—he said that I had been in the Ballarat riots and I did not ought to be afraid of a pistol—I told him that I was no more afraid of a pistol than he was—he said he knew it and that was the reason he put it to me—he then asked me if I knew who had pistols in the forecastle—I told him I only knew of two or three—he said We must bring it up and get them all —he then told me to go and lie in my bunk and consider of it for it would have to come off to-morrow night in the middle watch—I had a revolver which I kept in my chest—the prisoner told me he should load his fire arms and told me to load mine but clean it first—I then went to my bunk—next day Tuesday I had the forenoon watch in the morning and the dog watch in the evening—I saw Bolitho while I was on the forenoon watch and had some conversation with him—I saw the prisoner again on the dog watch from 6 to 8 o clock—after having the conversation with Bolitho I turned in I went below and saw the prisoner he was kneeling on the outside bunk and leaning ever his bunk the inside one—Bolitho was there in his own bunk—after that I had a watch from 6 o clock till 8—the prisoner came to me then and said Well chummy have you made up your mind yet —I said Lewis you had better leave this alone three of us will never do it —he said I will try another will that do —I said No six was little enough—he then told me that I wanted more pluck and asked me what sort of pluck I had in the Ballarat—I told him I had as much as was needed there—he said I have got courage enough for a dozen if I could shove it into you I have bad shots flying about my head like music —I said Weil you will never manage this and I think I will give it up —he told me to think of it again—he told me he would try Jonathan meaning Hugh Kent—I said No don t or you might sell yourself —he than left me—I was on duty again next night Wednesday from 8 to 12 o clock—the prisoner came to me in the latter part of the watch and said I spoke to Jonathan and he is firm —I said You have —he said Yes —I said Then it will go aft don t you see how he is always praising the ship up —he said Oh that is nothing —Bolitho came up to us then and Lewis told us again the same as he had been telling to me but said he did not tell Kent that we were in it but that he was going to do it only tried him whether he would do such a thing and he said I am sure he will join —I said I will have nothing to do with it but I told him it was safe and it should go no further—that was all that took place then that I recollect—I then turned in—this was on Wednesday night—on the Friday morning I went to the mate a little after 8 o clock and told him what had happened—the prisoner was then at the wheel—the mate was in his state room—before I went to the mate I had seen and spoken to Bolitho a very few minutes before—I was told by the mate to come into the cabin and report it to the captain—I and Bolitho went in together and the prisoner was taken into custody Cross-examined Q You have been at the diggings I believe A I have several Friar s Creek Avoca Ballarat Pyrenees Daisy Hill and the Amphitheatre no other that I am aware of—I went out in 1853—I was two years altogether at these different diggings—I was at Ballarat at the time of the riots—the prisoner heard me speak of that in the forecastle—there was no place called the Baker s Arms burnt down in the riots nor set fire to—I did not tell the prisoner that I set fire to the Baker s Arms— The witness was cautioned by the COURT that he was not compelled to answer questions which might tend to criminate himself —I have been talking about the note in the forecastle—there was a house burnt down—I had nothing to do with the burning of that house I swear that—I never told the prisoner that I had nor anything of the sort—I was present when it was burnt I saw it I was looking on—at one of the conversations Bolitho said it would want a good scholar to navigate the ship I understood—I said I could run her down there—we had a dispute about more help Bolitho said the help was not strong enough—he did not say We want more help he said there was not help enough—Walter and me and Lewis were disputing about more help—Walter held with me that there was not enough Lewis said there was plenty—this was on the Tuesday from 8 till 12 o clock—it was on the Tuesday in the dog watch that Lewis said he would try Jonathan and I said Don t do that or else you will sell yourself or something of that sort—I told him that because I was frightened it should go further before it went aft—T did not know anything about whether Kent would join I was afraid it would go further among the crew before it went aft—by going aft I mean going to the captain—I have heard Kent praising the ship in the forecastle—I do not know that he was always doing it I have heard him very often—it was true that he was in the habit of praising the ship Q Therefore you thought it was unlikely that he would join A I did not think anything about it I did not know I could not say—I never knew him before he was quite a stranger to me—I did not know what the man was—when he afterwards told me that he had spoken to Kent I said Then I will have nothing to do with if—I got my revolver in Ballarat not at the time of the riots long before—people want them there for their own protection—the miners there suffer from dysentery at times and eye blight I have had bad eyes myself—I used sulphate of zinc to cure them —I have not had dysentery—I do not know what the miners use for dysentery—I was never in company with any that had it—I hive heard of them having it but I never knew what they used—they very often went to town for advice—I do not know that at the remote diggings they take things with them for curing their complaints I always got what I wanted there—I have not known laudanum taken in water for dysentery nor for eye blight I never heard of it I am quite sure of that—I signed articles on 29th Jan —I believe I went on board on 1st Feb I am not certain—I never saw Bolitho before he came on board the ship that was the first time I ever saw him in my life that I know of he came on board the day after me—the prisoner joined more than a few hours before the ship sailed I do not recollect the day he came on board I did not take particular notice—I will not swear it was more than a day before we sailed—I and Bolitho were not more together than any of my other shipmates that I know of—we saw each other two or three or four times after the Monday night he and I alone together—I did just see the revolvers that were taken from the prisoner s bunk one day on the cabin table but not to see what they were perticularly—I know Colt s revolvers—you cannot draw the charge of them very well—I never tried—I always fired them off when I wanted to discharge one—you can draw it if you like there are plenty of ways of drawing the charge—I believe I could draw a charge out of Colt s revolvers though I have never tried it MR BODKIN Q You said that you were afraid this matter would get farther before it got aft what did you mean by that A I was afraid it would get among the crew I wanted the captain to know it before it went any further as I did not know the crew they were all strangers to me—I never had the least intention to join in this at all MR GIFFARD Q In any of these conversations we have heard of have you heard Bolitho say anything about a vessel that had 700l worth of jewellery in it A No—I never beard such a thing he never said anything to me at any time about it—I never heard him mention anything about a vessel that had 700l worth of gold or jewellery on board nor a large amount—I never heard anything more than Bolitho said that Lewis had told him that he Lewis had took a ship with 7 000 ounces of gold and two market boats as well—he never told me anything about his being in a vessel in which there was a large quantity of gold or jewellery not at any time HUGH KENT I was a seaman on board the Stebonheath I joined her at Melbourne about three days before she sailed—when I came on board they called me a Yankee and Jonathan—I am not a native of the United States—on the Wednesday after the ship sailed I was walking on the starboard side of the deck with three others when Lewis came and touched me on the shoulder and asked me would I have a glass of brandy—I said Yes being cold—I went with him down to leeward and sat on the top of a water cask—he handed me a pannikin about three parts full of brandy—a pannikin is a tin thing that we take our coffee out of it holds a pint—I took the pannikin out of his hand and drank part of it and I returned him the pannikin and he drank part of it—he then said It is a fine chance here now —I asked him which way—he said There is plenty of gold down below and we shall fasten the passengers up and we shall put one man on the captain s door and one on the mate s door and he asked me would I consent to it—I asked how many would it require—he said he could do it with four and he only wanted me—I told him that would not be enough I wanted more—he did not mention who the others were he said he was sure of four more out of the forecastle—with that Little Tom came up as we called him that is Whittington and the discourse dropped for that time—on the following evening Thursday he came to me again and asked me would I come and have a glass of grog with him and we went on the starboard side a little at the far end of the galley—he handed me a pannikin with about three glasses of grog in it—I drank about a glass he told me to drink more which I did not—he had told me in the first conversation that he would heave Mr Harris the second mate overboard—nothing passed on the Thursday evening—he was going to tell me who we going to be the persons to take her but a few chaps happened to be larking and I jumped off the water cask and ran for ard and went in the forecastle and stopped there—when Whittington came up on the Wednesday night the conversation did not go on it stopped he handed the pannikin to Tom to drink out of it and Tom drank Cross-examined Q Were you sent for on the Friday morning into the captain s cabin A Yes after the prisoner was taken—up to that time I had not made any communication to anybody—I had not been at the diggings THOMAS WHITTINGTON re-examined At the time the prisoner proposed pitching the look-out and the second mate overboard there would be the men of the second watch on deck—there would be eleven or twelve of us in the watch but they might be asleep or in the forecastle smoking a pipe it would be their duty to be on deck—there would be ten left after pitching over the look-out and the mate of those ten there would be myself Lewis Kent and Bolitho—there would then be six left—the crew consisted of about thirty-three—we were divided into two watches there was a great many that did not keep watch—it was usual to have eleven or twelve on deck at night—I have known most of us to be asleep when it was a fine night we are always called by the look-out if ire are wanted JAMES CONNELL I was chief mate of the Stebonheath On Friday 22nd Feb I was in my cabin between 8 and 9 o clock in the morning—Whittington came to me and made a communication and shortly afterwards I communicated with the captain in his cabin—Bolitho and Whittington afterwards came into the captain s cabin and made a statement in his presence—after that I went on deck—the prisoner was at the wheel—I went behind him and took hold of him by the captain s orders—he said What do you want with me —I said Oh never mind you will know by-and-bye —I then handcuffed him—the carpenter of the ship was with me Cross-examined Q Can you tell me when tie prisoner came on board A No I cannot—the articles are here produced —fourteen or fifteen is the proper number of men to be on deck at one watch—they are not always on deck they are in general it is their duty to be on deck JOHN SEBGEANT I was master of the Stebonheath She was a ship of 1 014 tons burden—she had a crew of thirty-five or thirty-six men and twenty-two passengers there were about eight men I think and the same number of females and the others were children—I scarcely know in what station of life the passengers generally were some were merchants—there were none who had come from the diggings—we had a large quantity of gold on board 61 000 ounces—the value of that would be 240 000l or 250 000l —these are the ship s articles—Lewis signed articles on 14th Feb —he would not come on board the same day—I think he came on board a day or two before we sailed—I did not know him before nor Whittington Kent or Bolitho they were all strangers—on Friday 22nd Feb a communication was made to me by the chief mate in consequence of which I sent for Bolitho and Whittington—they made a statement to me which was entered in the official log—I gave the mate directions to seize the prisoner he was then at the wheel—he was kept in confinement until we arrived in England—I had his bonk searched previous to his being secured—I was not present—a bag was brought to me—I sent the second mate Harris with Whittington and Bolitho—the bag contained these things produced by inspector White —here are two six-barrelled Colt revolvers some of them double shotted—the second bullets hare been rammed home with a piece of wood which was taken from the prisoner s pocket and which is a piece of the ship s side—there are two single-barrelled pistols loaded—they were not loaded when they were found the second mate loaded them afterwards by my direction—all the barrels of the revolvers were loaded and capped—here are two bowie knives a powder flask nearly full a bag containing five boxes of percussion caps not full a bag of bullets some of them of a size to fit the revolvers and some not a life preserver a quantity of loose bullets sixty or seventy a bottle of laudanum and a keg containing two quarts of brandy—these things were produced in consequence of the search which I directed to be made—after the prisoner was taken into custody I told him that if he attempted to escape I would shoot him—he was kept in a place of security and when we arrived at Gravesend he was taken into custody by an officer—as we came into the Channel I read over to the prisoner or the surgeon did in my presence what had been written in the official log book—I have it have— read Friday Feb 22 1856 Mr Connell chief officer reported to me Captain Sergeant that Thomas Whittington had spoken to him of a conspiracy to take the ship 9 A M called Thomas Whittington and Walter Bolitho into the cabin in the presence of Mr Grey cabin passenger when they made the following statement Walter Bolitho having the forecastle look-out from 8 till 10 P M and Thomas Whittington from 10 till 12 P M on Monday Feb 18 William Lewis A B came and said If the Russians should take us as a prize how would you like to have a share of that gold yourself at the same time holding a pan with brandy He then again said How would you like your share of it it can easily be done there are about two tons of it I replied I could not think of it He said I will have another to join I have pistols I will shoot the captain and mate and then shall have twelve shots to spare I have a keg of brandy and a bottle of laudanum to set the crew to sleep we can make away with them after securing the captain ran the ship down to the coast of Peru and scuttle her if you two will stick to me I will sign with my heart s blood a treaty for you to share you will have nothing to do but stand at the gangway with a pistol I will manage the cabin you must shoot the first man that comes out of the forecastle if they are not sufficiently dosed by G— I will have charge of the cabin before Saturday morning 4 o clock it is time the old mate was out of this world William Lewis being at this time at the wheel sent Mr Harris the second mate with Whittington and Bolitho to seize the arms in his bunk they exactly agreed with their description of them consisting of two six-barrel Colt revolvers loaded and in perfect order two single-barrel pistols two bowie knives bullets caps and powder —I made that entry on 6th March copied from one taken down at the time the statement was made—I took it down at the time from their mouths and afterwards made an accurate copy of it into the log and read it over to Whittington and Bolitho—I have not got the other paper it was taken down in pencil—upon my reading this over to the prisoner he said it was false—I think that was the substance of what he said—he did not ask anything about his belt he did at the Thames police court Cross-examined Q The list of things found in his berth was not mentioned to him at the time was it A No—Harris went with Bolitho and Whittington to find them—I am certain that the prisoner did not come on board the same day that we sailed I cannot say when he came on board I was on shore on business he must have been on board the day before we sailed because we started early in the morning—the gold was shipped probably four days before sailing—I was present when it was done the greater part of the crew that were then on board assisted in carrying it on board Q The prisoner complained did he not after this statement was read over to him of 50l having been taken out of his belt A Not till we got before Mr Yardley at the Thames police court that was the first I heard of it—there was a belt I think it is mentioned in the official log—it appears to be a belt for carrying gold dust and money—the seamen do not carry these kind of knives they do carry knives but not bowie knives—we do not search their chests—I never saw them with a bowie knife—I think it is very unusual for a seaman in our service to have a bowie knife—I do not know whether the gold diggers carry them I have never been to the diggings—the Colt s revolvers are still loaded—I do not know whether there is a difficulty in withdrawing the charge—I kept them loaded to produce—I scarcely know whether or not there is a rule against discharging pistols in the Bay of Melbourne MR BODKIN Q Do you know anything of a China escort being expected with gold about the time your vessel sailed A There was a vessel to sail for Hong Kong with gold—I do not know whether or not the gold had come down from the country—it does come down to the banks under escort COURT Q Does the gold that you bring home come in dust or in quartz A In dust it is deposited in the after run of the ship not in my cabin—it does not occupy a great space DAVID HARRIS I was second mate of the Stebonheath on her homeward passage from Melbourne On Friday 22nd Feb by the captain s direction I went to the place where the bunks are—I went to the prisoner s bunk and there found the whole of the things that have been produced—I took them to the captain—I afterwards loaded the two single-barrel pistols by the captain s direction—I kept possession of all these things until the vessel arrived at Gravesend—I then handed them over to inspector White when the prisoner was given into custody Cross-examined Q Did Whittington and Bolitho point out to you the place in the berth where you found these things A Yes they handed the things out of the bunk I saw them take them out I was alongside of them they were all in a bag except the brandy and the laudanum—this is the bag in which they were RICHARD WHITE Thames police inspector The prisoner was given into my charge on 24th May by the captain on board the vessel at Gravesend—I told him that he was charged with mutiny and he must consider himself my prisoner—he made no answer—I received the articles produced from Mr Harris in the presence of the captain in the cuddy—I conveyed the prisoner by rail to London and took him to the Thames police station Wapping where the charge was taken by superintendant Evans and read over to the prisoner—I have the charge sheet here it contains a list of the things I had to take care of—when the part was read which describes the single-barrelled pistols as being loaded the prisoner said I did not load them —the list describes the revolvers as being loaded to that he said nothing—when we came to the belt he said There was fifty sovereigns in that belt —he had not said anything to me about the fifty sovereigns before that—I had travelled with him all the way from Gravesend—I said I would have some inquiry made about it—he said all the articles belonged to him—inspector Shane was with me—I left the prisoner in his custody for a short time at Gravesend while I went to take the tickets—I handed this bottle to Mr Boss it was then full Cross-examined Do you know whether there is not some difficulty in unloading the revolvers A I have had them tested and bored at the gun-smith s and they are loaded with powder and ball—I do not know that there is some difficulty in unloading a revolver after it is once loaded you can discharge it by firing without doing so I should think you cannot unload them without boring them they are forced in so heavily the leverage is so great—if I did not want to discharge a revolver I should bore it in order to unload it you bore them with a piercer I saw it done at the gunsmith s you bore through the bullet in order to see that there is powder behind JOSEPH SHANE Thames police inspector I was with White at Gravesend when he had the prisoner in custody—he left me with him on the Diamond pier for a short time—I asked him what sort of passage they had had—he said a very good one—he then said They have done it well for me Whittington ought to be in my place I have made my mind up I suppose I shall get for life it is no use saying nothing JOHN BROWN ROSS I am house surgeon at the London Hospital I have examined the contents of this bottle which I received from inspector White—it contains laudanum—I have not tested the strength it appears to be commercial laudanum which is a little more than half the strength of the best which we use in our hospitals Cross-examined Q Can you identify the label that is on the bottle A No the only word I can trace is Brompton —laudanum is used with other medicines for dysentery and is a soothing lotion for sore eyes GUILTY Aged 25 — Transported for Life

went to No 27 in St Thomas the Apostle in Queen-street the house was shut up and there was no one in it A week after I had an information that persons were in the house I went there and found Joseph Gates and John Evans I saw Phillips and Tonner the prisoner they were removing a grindstone in the cellar I observed on the floor of the cellar a plank of wood fixed in the ground where something had been fixed of a machine for stamping I then went up into the garret I asked them what they were doing they said they were only porters hired by a gentleman in Fleet-street that day they said they did not know him I asked where they lay they said in a hay field I searched them and found near 3 l a piece upon each of them gold and other money I asked them where they were going to remove to they said a cart and horses was waiting in Black Friars to receive them that they had been with other thing with a knot to Black Friars and there found the cart and horse I went there with them and waited for the cart and horse nobody came to it then I sent it to the Green yard and took the two men to the Compter I went up stairs before and found two forms that were in the garret with a quantity of nine sand for casting metals I said they should go to different prisons and then Phillips confessed there was an information made and in consequence of it I went to Kensington Palmer was removed there it was on the 16th at night near ten o clock we went to Kensington and took Phillips with us we rang a great while at the door and nobody came I then put my hand through the gate lifted up the latch and got into the yard they assisted me and we broke the door open I went and searched all over the house and there was nobody in it we found a wheel producing it for the purpose of polishing brass after they are punched out by one instrument the roughness is taken of and they are brightened by that wheel I found a quantity of blanks for half-pence not stamped producing some of them I found the wheel in the fore cellar it was lined with leather they put emery and oil in it and turn it round and their own weight on the leather brightens them Q Were any of the back door open Gates I believe they went out at the back door as we went in at the fore door This scoter producing it I found in the out house it marks the width of the halfpence and then they cut it with shears We found this producing a large engine with a fly to it that cuts the halfpence out of the slips of copper we found it in the stable We found a back door into another stable that we broke open there we found a stamping machine we also found a quantity of blank dyes 50 I suppose there is no impression on them We stayed in the house four or five hours at least before we got the things into a cart to get them away to the Mansion House When I came away I left Burton Wilson and Evans in the house There is always three persons employed to work the machine with the fly one stands at each end of the fly and one puts the copper under it cannot be worked without three persons Q You found all these things by the direction of Phillips Gates Yes Phillips gave an account of them before we went every thing tallied very minutely with the account he gave There is a quantity of new halfpence I found under the stamping instrument Cross Examination Q All these things you are talking of were found in the house of Mr Palmer Gates Yes I found the act of parliament in one of Mr Palmer s pockets in the house at Kensington Hannah Turvey I live with Mr Page a wine merchant No 26 Queen-street Cheapside next door to the place in question Q Did you live there in last May Turvey Yes I have seen Tonner at Palmer s several times the other I do not know that I ever saw Q Did you ever see or hear any thing going on Turvey This day five weeks I went to the door to let two gentlemen in and saw a cart and horses they were going to remove that night it was the day before Mr Gates came I saw several things I could not think what they were there were two men I cannot say who they were the last thing that came out was a box and instead of pitching it in the cart they pitched it beside the cart and it broke open and some things came out I took one up it was copper the size of a halfpenny there was neither head nor tail on it there was about a hatful fell out I asked them what they were they said they were tops of buttons Q Who said that Turvey The man that drove the cart I used now and then to hear a dead knock Q Was the knock often repeated Turvey I used to hear it several times Q Pray did you ever hear any thing particular besides Turvey No Cross Examination Q You know nothing at all of those men that were removing that night Turvey No Edward Wilson I went to Kensington with Mr Joseph Gates and Thomas Gates we searched the house I stayed in the house after Gates went away About five in the morning Davis came to the outer gate and put his hand through the iron gate to lift the latch up Evans saw him come in and told me of it and called Jack Jack run to the door I believe there is one of the men there I ran to the door and saw Davis there I asked him what he wanted he said to speak to the master of the house I asked him what he wanted with him he said he had done some work for him and wanted to be paid for it I bid him follow me round to the back part and he did very quietly and John Evans met us at the farm yard gate and we both conducted him through the stable gate and brought him to the place where the instruments were knocked up or struck up and he said what have I done we took him into the kitchen and bid him sit down in the chair Q What answer did you make to him when he said what had he done Wilson I said nothing at all When he sat in the chair he made directly at the tongs I laid hold of him then and secured him that he should not do any mischief with that he threw John Evans on one side while he had the tongs in his hand and he wanted to get away from me a little man that assisted us with the poker struck Davis on the arm and the head and knocked him down then I tied Davis by the wrist and carried him to Baize-Water when he came there he was saint with the loss of blood he had lost near a quart I gave him part of two pots of beer and brought him to town he came quietly till he came near Bow-street I sent for a coach and he got away and ran up George-street and got the handkerchief off his wrist I pursued him and cried stop thief and took him again and got a coach and carried him to the Poultry Compter John Evans I was one of the persons left behind by Mr Gates I was up one pair of stairs and saw Davis come to the gate and put his hand through to try to open the gate I suspected him to belong to them I called out to Wilson to run as fast as he could to the gate and we secured him this was about five o clock in the morning Joseph Sage I am a moneyer in the Mint Q Have you seen the press and things Sage Yes I have looked at them all Q Are they fit for coining halfpence Sage They will coin halfpence silver or gold or any thing Q Is the mill fit for cleaning of halfpence Sage Yes Tonner s Defence The gentleman hired me as a porter all I did was to

A A pair of dies in one and only one die in the other the bottom die We had Buckley with us at the time We came back into this accompting house there upon a counter was a scale fixed to a beam at the furtherend of that counter was a writing desk I lifted up the top of that desk I found a paper which when I opened was a quantity of this coin which I now produce it appeared very fresh In a drawer under the counter were some blanks in a paper which were not struck but were edged there was adjoining to that a stone place it formerly had been used in a silver manufactory and a cutter which stood in the corner with a quantity of this sissel of copper in that place there was a a pan with some pickle then standing in it in a box in the accompting house close by the side where this money was found I found this pan and another box with a composition of something which will produce the colour of silver In the same place was a quantity of saw dust some clean and some dirty and on the counter was a card of shirt buttons We went down into the kitchen below stairs there was a quantity of watch seals in paper then we returned up to a shop which has two stair cases for the workmen to go out of the shop without going through the house that is over the back kitchen and the accompting house there was what is called an edging tool fixed there with two lathes but nobody at work in the accompting house there was a great quantity of other money that we have in bags this was on the box stuffed with saw dust There was two bags full of small money in the same accompting house the apparatus was all brought away by the officers I and Vickrey took young Buckley in Spital fields I left Mason and Bishop behind me we took these things on the Saturday On the Sunday we went there to take the apparatus down Q All this apparatus the composition and the pickles are they such things as coiners make use of -

A Yes Q These are not the coin of Prussia but counterfeits - A They do resemble it but not so as to be deceived Mr Gurney Do they resemble so as one would be taken for the other - A The large coin if it came to my inspection I certainly should not take it for the real coin Q That is not because it is worn out as some of our shillings are - A No the real Prussian coin has a remarkable likeness of the king this face is not like the king s face at all Q Is it a coin of silver mixed with copper - A I cannot tell no coin in Prussia is considered as silver but the rix dollar I suppose they are mixed Q Now the grosschen the proper name of that is gute grosschen - A Yes but in the provinces where these are done it goes by the name of grosschen in the kingdom it goes by the name of gute grosschen Q Do you know whether this coin is struck at Berlin or at Brandenburgh -

in a box close to the left hand of the large engine I found several pieces of large coin that exactly matched with the large die I read the inscription on the die and on one of the pieces and they were exactly alike letter for letter there was a little wooden box which is now out of doors in the cart with the other heavy and large instruments the press was worked by means of the foot there was a hole dug in the ground two feet and a half deep and when the bed of the die was fixed it came to their hands it was worked by the foot in this manner witness describing it the dies being close to their middle they could work without stopping to it In this box was another die it appears to be the top die in the small press to this little shed was a small window the stamps were between the men that worked and the light it threw a light down upon the bed of the work they stood with their faces to the press and the light was on the opposite side of them there was a curtain to prevent any body from looking in in this same drawer there were several pieces of coin which I have here with the dies these were found in this box where the die out of the small press was found Court What is that - A Pieces of coin resembling these large and small the principal part is large - that there was found in the drawer some of them are perfect and some appear to have been struck twice to see whether the dye would take the effect These are the dies that were in the large stamping engine this die was fixed in the bed of the small stamping engine these dies were left in this box these three were left to all that was there the officers all saw it we then went to the accomptinghouse there was a counter fixed in the accompting house with several dies on it there were some dies on it there were some drawers standing on the top of it and there were two or three cards of sleeve buttons on it as if for the purpose of shewing to gentlemen that they dealt in buttons At the further part of this accompting house was a desk I saw Armstrong take out a large paper of this coin I produce the edging tool I saw a cutting engine standing at the right hand corner coming in I saw the pickle and the silvery composition there were two laths up stairs there were several other working tools that did not appear to this business therefore they were not brought away the dies and small articles were taken away on Saturday night on Sunday we went again for the purpose of taking away the stamping engine after we had taken away the top part there was a large iron bed which weighs near three hundred pounds weight it was fixed in a block in doing that I found coming out of the ground this piece of coin it is completely fresh in moving the small die we found two or three pieces of coin Old Buckley and Hartcup was taken in custody while we were gone to search Hartcup s house at Kilburn when we came back a taylor came and said he had two suits of clothes he was asked if he would leave them be said no he took them away afterwards Homer came he was taken in custody Q He did not come in the house -

t18151206-48  47 WILLIAM BAGNELL THE ELDER WILLIAM BAGNELL THE YOUNGRR and THOMAS BAGNELL were indicted for that they feloniously on the 17th of November did make coin and counterfeit and did willingly cut and assist in the making coining and counterfeiting ten pieces of coin resembling certain silver dollars coined stampt issued and circulated by the Governour and Company of the Bank of England containing on the one side thereof an impression of his Majesty s head and with the following words to wit Georgius III Dei Gratia Rex And on the reverse side thereof an impression of Brittania and the following words and figures to wit Five shillings Dollar Bank of England 1804 against the statute SECOND COUNT The same as the first only substituting the words made with intent to resemble instead of resembling JOHN FOY I am an officer In consequence of some information which I received I went on the 17th of November to Sewel street Clerkenwell My brothers Thomas Foy who is an officer and William Foy who is not an officer and Samuel Plank accompanied me We went to No 8 very early in the morning and st about six o clock in the evening we heard a noise as if a press were at work at the back part of the house that is at No 8 Sewell street The door of the adjoining house was open and I and Thomas Foy went through No 7 into itsgarden The garden of No 7 is separated from that of No 8 by a small low fence I left Plank and William Foy in the street and desired them when I got through to knock at the door and get admittance that way When we were in No 7 we heard the same noise I got over the fence and into the prisoner s garden The whole back of the prisoner s shop at the back part of the house is a window and looks into this garden I saw all the prisoners at that part of the shop where the press is The candles were lighted but I could not immediately see how they were employed but they were all at the press I went into the shop by a door which goes from the garden My brother went in with me At that time there had been a knocking at the front door but I did not hear it When I went in at the shop door William Bagnell the elder went into the kitchen he attempted to pass one of the front kitchen door but finding it secure and finding some one there he return d into the shop where I was We took the three prisoners into custody and as soon as my brother took hold of William he threw down a quantity of dollars I saw him throw them down there were six in number they were perfect dollars I marked them and gave them to Mr Westwood In taking the father into custody I was about to search him he had his hand clinched I opened it and found four dollars on him in that hand dollars put into the hands of the witness Those are the four dollars I found in the hand of the father Those are the six thrown away by William Bagnell the younger Then I searched the shop and found a stamping press the lower dye of which bearing a matrix of the King s head was fixt I parted it at the same time I found that the collar was on Articles put into the hands of the witness This is the upper and this is the lower dye the collar fits them The use of the collar is to prevent the mettle spreading in stamping From the appearance of the press altogether it is my opinion that it had been working previously and from the upper dye being warm I think it had been just struck On the press I found a spanish dollar with the original impression upon the sides and edges obliterated apparently by a file or some such instrument that would inable the impression to be made with more facility There was an iron tray in which were thirty two Spanish dollars similarly prepared From the appearance with which it was working when we heard it there must be three persons at work at it The principal upon which it is worked is this - An immense weight is raised by two persons and then let go after the manner of a pile-driver upon the dyes and thereby occasions the impression to be made on the piece of metal between them This weight is raised by a rope going over a wheel and a third person feeds the dyes that is puts in the blank metal and takes out that which has the impression Plank and my other brother had come in at the front at the same time The father said I hope you will observe we are only stamping Spanish dollars and hoped his case would be represented as favourable as possible and said that if his giving up the persons who employed him would be of any service he would do that willingly We apprehended all three and brought them away with the press and all the other things THOMAS FOY I am a police officer belonging to the same office I heard the press going before we went in I seized William Bagnell the younger and he threw something behind him I have heard the account which my brother has given and it is perfectly correct SAMNEL PLANK I am an officer belonging to Marlborough street and knocked at the front door at the same time that John and Thomas went in through the next house Mrs Bagnell opened the door and I stopped the other Bagnell at the other door as he was making an attempt to come out I took the elder Bagnell by the arm and John Foy took the four dollars out of his hand I took the stamping press dies and all the things which have been mentioned WILLIAM FOY I went into the front of the house with Plank I saw nothing different from what my brothers saw I went into the kitchen and saw old Bagnell just in custody I saw all the things in the shop MR JAMES THURGOOD I am a teller of the Bank I look at the four dollars taken from the elder Bagnell s hand they are counterfeit The impressions on them are as stated in the indictment I now look at the six found on the younger Bagnell they are all counterfeit and bear similar impressions I know look at the dyes and think that those dollars were struck by them JOSEPH HENRY HARPER I am engraver to the Bank I look at the dollars and the dyes and these dollars are made from the dyes Mr Alley on the part of the prisoners objected that the offence with which the prisoners were charged was not the one contemplated by the statute because that was to prevent persons for counfeiting five shilling dollars-when in fact this was counterfeiting five and sixpenny dollars and therefore this offence did not come within the letter of the statute A similar punishment was alloted to persons convicted of coining three shilling and eighteen penny bank tokens Suppose the bank chose to issue the one for three shillings and six-pence the other for one shilling and ninepence after such nominal value could the counterfeiter be punishable under the act as it now stood unquestionably in the learned counsels opinion-not Mr Barry on the same side stated that in the preamble of this statute the bank appeared to think it necessary to recite their authority for assigning three shilling and eighteen penny tokens by doing so and he objected that it had not shewn its authority for issuing five and six penny dollars and the case of the prosecution being closed they were now excluded from doing COURT We will first dispose of the objection taken by the latter gentleman It is not material upon the present occasion for the bank to shew their authority for affixis ng a nominal value of five shillings and sixpence to the dollar and it is merely an engagement on its part with the public to give that sum for the dollar In respect of the first objection taken thethe indictment charges the prisoners with making and coining and acting and assisting in such making and coining pieces of coin resembling certain silver dollars coined &c by the governor and company of he bank of England containing certain impressions which the indictment recites and in the indictment of which consists the offence aimed at by the statute and therefore the value nominal or real has nothing to do with it Bagnell the elder defence now put in a written defeuce most solemnly denying any intention to defraud the bank but stating that he had been employed by a person named Goldston to immitate a certain coin which that person gave him which though in a degree it resembled was not so like the bank dollar or for any one to be deceived by it This he immitated and it was in its impression considerably different from the bank dollar he further agreed that it was a well known fact that he as a dye sinker and every man in his profession with equal case had he been fraudently inclined could copy most correctly the impression upon genuine dollars and he concluded by endeavouring to exculpate his sons from any blame in the matter A number of witnesses were then called to character THE COURT then summed up the evidence for the jury and informed them that it was immaterial for this charge what the mettal or composition was of which the counterfeit coins were made WILLIAM BAGNELL senior GUILTY aged 46 THOMAS BAGNELL GUILTY aged 26 WILLIAM BAGNELL junior GUILTY aged 18 Transported

There are various ways by which it may be done The line containing London and the date is engraved and done with engraving ink in a genuine note it is stereotyped and with printing ink It purports to be signed by P Lister we have a signing-clerk of that name I have know him ever since I have been in the Bank and know his hand-writing -

A No They have many plates I can safely say from my experience that it is not a water-mark I am certain as far as my judgment goes that it is not the signature of Lister MR SERGEANT BOSANQUET Q You have been twenty years an inspector during which time you have become well acquainted with the bank paper and plates - A Yes and am in the daily habit of seeing thousands of notes both before and after they are impressed Q Looking at the notes and bearing in your mind your recollection of the character of the paper and plates have you the least doubt of their not being genuine - A None whatever Q In the instances you have mentioned of forged notes having been paid at the Bank have the attention of the inspectors been called to them or is it from the neglect of their not being called to see them -

A I should have known it A JUROR to MR LEES Q Has an instance ever occurred that a genuine note has been rejected and stamped as forged - A I told you Sir on Monday that it had Itwas a very old note very much worn and pasted at the back as I stated before and was rejected by a young inspector If it had been properly looked at I think it would have been discovered Q I asked you if you ever saw the water-mark made and I think you said Yes - A I never said so I have seen the moulds from which they have been made Q Was you ever a paper-maker engraver or worked on stereotype - A No Q I think on Monday you admitted that there were private marks and that the public would not be benefitted by their being known -

Horne is an acquaintance of mine I do not know that he has been in trouble lately - I never was in trouble I never speculated in shans and couters before the 13th of July - the first information I had of this was from Horne at Fairlop-fair I knew what a couter meant it is a very common word if a sailor comes to sleep at my house it is usual for me to take care of their money - I have had a great deal of money in my hands and in the morning I returned it to them they do not find any couters among it unless they gave them to me - I never saw a bad sovereign in my life before JAMES FOGG I am an officer of the Thames-police Watts gave me information on the 12th of July and on the 13th he shewed me three counterfeit sovereigns which I marked and returned to him on the 19th I was with Mitchell and Carter on Tower-hill but I did not take the prisoner untill the 22d of August at Kent-street in the Borough -

we had four brace of pistols and powder and shot I was more afraid of his dog than I was of him - he told me if his dog had been at home I should not have had him then I knew Watts before - he did live over the water but I never knew of his keeping a house until he kept the one he lives in now he came to me first on this subject and asked what they were to do - I said I would mention it to the Mint and tell him I do not think Horne was with Watts the first night - if he was I had no conversation with him I have known Horne five or six months - I never knew that Watts and him went about to catch people with money I do not believe Watts keeps a house of reception for sailors and common women I have been in his house but I saw no woman but his wife ALEXANDER MITCHELL I received these three counterfeit sovereigns on the 14th of July from George Watts Cross-examined Q When did Fogg open this business to you first A About the 11th I was not in company with him when he went to Watts -

Bill and Rose were together when they left the Plough and they went together to the prisoner s in Grange-court Bill was a little behind - Rose said he had given the good money to the prisoner we did not take the prisoner then because we had others to take and if we had apprehended him first the others would have got off - the news would soon have flown I have not tried to find Bill - I saw him I suppose a week ago I did not tell him to come here he might have come here if he chose WILLIAM BRAND I am one of the marshalsmen of the City -

I worked for Mr Seagar s brother who is a gun-maker for six years I do not get my living by entrapping people for the Mint but by honest industry the whole of the last twelve months as a gun-maker and doing odd jobs I never was engaged in any thing of this kind before - I do not know a person of the name of Bill and never was employed but on this occasion I swear I only heard the term pegs a fortnight before - Mr Seager told me the slang names they gave them Mr Seager knew me by working for his brother I do not expect to get any thing for this -

not exactly on this business I was employed by Seagar to detect him - I was never employed to entrap any but the prisoner and Nash I was looking for Nash and the prisoner spoke to me - I had never seen him before he came and asked who was I looking for was I looking for Nash I said I had rather see Winter-bank I had never seen Winterbank but I had heard of his name - I did not go after Winterbank he was in the Compter Mr Seager had told me so but I wanted the prisoner to think I was in the line I said it as a blind -I understand Welch is about eleven years of age the officers were about eight yards from me when I met Crouch I was on one side of the way and they on the other up a court - he might see them I have not been drilled in this business - I was close to him when the little girl gave him the money open it was not in paper I did not say a word about paper - we went into the Bluecoat school yard and eight shillings were given to me he had the ten shillings in his right hand -

on the 6th he came to my house about nine o clock in the morning Bates searched him in my presence - I marked two shillings and gave them to him I marked them so that I should know them again and told him to go to Little Britain and by no means to go out of my sight but wait till Cronch came who had appointed to meet him there that morning - Bates was in company with me - he waited at a public-house till three o clock in the afternoon we were waiting at a public-house opposite till Cronch joined him - they then went on towards the Blue coat school I followed in company with Bates till we came to Montague-court and there I turned up and waited a few minutes - I saw Crouch set down by the side of Welch on the coping which supports the iron railing - the witness was standing Crouch got up in a minute or two I saw him speak to Welch who put her hand under her frock and gave him something I do not know what - I then saw the witness give Cronch something which he transferred to Welch they then went into the Blue coat school-yard - Welch remained outside I then crossed from Montague-court and looked through the iron railing in the mean time I saw Crouch give something to the witness - Bates seized Crouch and the witness proceeded on at a quick pace but I went and took him he gave me these eight shillings much in the same state they are now in - they were not in paper I marked them - Zimmerman went about his business I saw Bates scuffling with the prisoner in the yard - I saw Bates pick up one shilling and a blue coat boy picked up another I then took the prisoner to the Compter -Bates searched him and I searched him afterwards nothing was found on him - I said You thought you were very cunning did you not he said I get my living in an honest way I serve the hospital - I believe that was all that passed not finding any thing on Crouch and knowing that the money had passed from Zimmerman we thought Welch had got them - we took her under the archway of Bartholomew-hospital two women were with her - seeing her so young a girl we thought she might be acting under instructions we took them all three to a public-house and upon Welch we found nineteen bad shillings 7s 6d good money and 5 1/2d in copper two of the good ones were those I had marked in the morning these are them -

I do not know whether the blue coat boy is here I did not bring him - I left it to those who had the conducting of this business I have known the witness six or eight years - I met him at my brother s and told him I wanted him to do this business - he volunteered at once though I was satisfied with his honesty I thought it my duty to search and watch him - I kept him in sight all the way till he came to the Blue coat school-yard MR SCARLETT Q I understand for about four months your attention has been drawn to some transactions of this nature A Yes - I consider it my duty as an officer to look after these people and to give information to the officers of the Mint - I am not in any other way employed by them I am paid for the time I am in attendance by the County or the city I believe expences of witnesses are usually paid THOMAS BATES I am superintendent of the ward of Aldersgate I have heard Seager s evidence - it is perfectly true while I was scuffling with Crouch he was trying to shake something from his right-hand which was 2s I seized him with one arm - I was picking a shilling up when Seager advanced I thought one had rolled down a grating but a blue coat boy named Burns gave it to me - these are them they have not been out of my possession since I seized them in his hand as soon as I took one up I saw it was bad - I took Welch and found on her those two shillings which I had marked before Cross-examined Q How long have you been in this employ A No time at all but it is my duty as an officer we have so many complaints in the ward of Aldersgate - every shopkeeper is burthened with bad coin I took George Fowler on the 19th of April - it was my own voluntary act I expect nothing for it - it has cost me money out of my own pocket the coin was not in paper - I believe it was open in her hand I was nearest the witness when he gave his evidence and did not hear the word paper - there was not time to fold them in paper I made application for the Blue coat boy to come but it is not allowed unless an application is made from a Magistrate MR JOHN FIELD These shillings are all counterfeit the eight and the two -

I then went to my lodgings in St Andrew-street and stopped there till a young man named William came Myers went to my lodgings with me - my lodging is fifty or sixty yards from where I saw the officers Myers had not left me before I saw William I do not know William s surname - he took me to West-street which is forty or fifty yards off - I there saw the prisoner and spoke to him in the street I had seen him before - he said he was glad to see I was not the rogue he suspected he said he had some suspicion of me - I then purchased sixteen half-crowns of him he had before arranged to meet me and to supply me with any coin I wanted to any amount - that was on the 5th I gave him seven shillings and two sixpences for the sixteen half-crowns I put them into my pocket and gave them to the officer - the prisoner promised to meet me on the next day to supply me with 3l worth more as his moulds were imperfect and he would have some better the next day I promised to meet him the next day at West-street - when the purchase was made I went with the prisoner to a public-house in New Compton-street - we had some porter I then went back to Goff at the Two Angels and Crown - it was then about twelve o clock - I gave the half-crowns to Goff and marked them there Myers came in at the time - I gave an account of what had passed COURT Q Were the two sixpences and the seven shillings the same you had from Goff A Yes they were not marked William was not in sight when I met him GEORGE GOFF I am an inspector of the Police -

they went out of my sight but I had directed Myers to follow them they went in a direction towards Compton-street - when Birt returned I received sixteen half-crowns from him these are them I believe the prisoner was taken on Saturday last - we met on the next day at the public-house to make another purchase and to endeavour to take the prisoner but he did not come - Limbrick afterwards took him Prisoner Q Why did not you apprehend me when you saw the money pass A Because we meant to take you the next day when you were to bring a larger quantity I believe William is about the Court - I do not know why he is not a witness I do not know that he has been a witness before he has given me information COURT Q Do you know his surname A Yes RICHARD MYERS On the 6th of July I was at the Two Angels and Crown - what has been stated is correct when Birt had left the public-house I followed him to his lodgings which is at an open shop and he stood with his hand on the door-post for about five minutes - shortly after William came and took Birt to West-street I was on the other side of the way - I then went to the parlour of the Two Angels and Crown where I had a full sight of Birt and the prisoner I had not lost sight of Birt before he saw the prisoner - they were just in the act of joining when I went into the parlour Birt and the prisoner had some words together - the prisoner put his hand into his right-hand pocket and pulled out a small parcel and a paper fell from it Birt took the parcel and gave the prisoner something - they then went to a public-house in Compton-street I followed them in went to the bar and had something to drink that I might have a view of them - Birt then came out and went to the Two Angels and Crown I followed and saw him give Goff the money JOHN FIELD I am an inspector of counterfeit coin at the Mint These half-crowns are all bad they are Britannia metal and appear to be cast in the same mould Prisoner s Defence There was no money found on me good bad or indifferent it is very evident that these people will swear any thing the reason William is not brought forward is because he cannot show his head in this Court GUILTY Aged 28 -

t18310217-108  533 CHARLES PERKINS and JOHN CARTWRIGHT were indicted for a like offence MR SCARLETT conducted the prosecution EDWARD BIRT I am a carpenter On the 17th of November I went to the Golden Cans public-house at the corner of Laystall-street and Tothill-street Westminster about a quarter before nine o clock - I saw the two prisoners there Perkins went by the name of Charles Green - I was introduced to them then I had never seen them before - I went out with Cartwright to purchase some counterfeit coin of him when I went in Barnes spoke to Perkins and he nodded to me to stop there - Perkins then came up to me and said he did not serve himself but as he had a knowledge of the person who had introduced me his partner Cartwright should serve me Perkins who called himself Green then produced a bag which he gave to Cartwright when I was in the passage - Cartwright and I then went on to the corner of the street under the bar-window he there asked me what coin I wanted - I said six half-crowns and he gave them to me out of the bag which had been given him by Perkins and I gave him 6s for them which I had received from Gollocker the bag contained more money - I saw more half-crowns in it when I had given Cartwright the 6s Perkins came up and said he ran quite risk enough by making them without selling them to a person he had no knowledge of Cartwright gave him the 6s - after this transaction was finished I went to Gollocker at the Red Lion in Fleet-street Myers went with me - he had been standing in Laystall-street and I believe saw me deal I could see him at the time - I marked the counterfeit half-crowns at the Red Lion and gave them to Myers Cartwright said that if neither he nor Perkins were at the Golden Cans I might ask the waiter who would find them - I did not know where they lived Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you evergo to the waiter at the Golden Cans A No - I am very seldom without business I have two or three notes in my pocket now - I did not bring them for any purpose I have known Myers two years or better - he was an officer when I first knew him he first employed me in jobs of this kind last summer in the case of McCarthy - I was then in business as a carpenter and had not much time to spare but I considered it my public duty to undertake such a job it was from principle and duty but I expected to be paid for my loss of time - I do not consider I was paid enough I believe I got between 4l and 5l in McCarthy s case - I was very well satisfied these cases are the next I have had - I have not looked for any other I do not know whether I expect as much for each of these cases as I had in McCarthy s - I do not know that it depends on their conviction or acquittal I value my time at 4s 6d a day - I have got 5s 6d I think the Mint paid me 4s 6d a day in McCarthy s case but I do not recollect JURY Q Did Myers see you in the passage A Yes he was standing in the street RICHARD MYERS I am a tobacconist and was for ten years a constable I know Birt and employed him to assist me in this business - he receives no remuneration but for his loss of time no bargain is made with him that I know of - on the 17th of November an appointment was made to meet him and Barnes at the Red Lion in Poppin s-court Fleet-street we met soon after eight o clock in the evening - I searched Birt and found nothing on him he was then furnished with six good shillings - I then went with him and Barnes to the Three Golden Cans in Laystall-street we got there a little before nine o clock - Barnes went into the house first then Birt and I took my station at a house opposite in a short time I saw Birt come out and stand with his back against the bar-window - he had not been there more than two or three minutes I should think when Cartwright came out and stood immediately opposite him with one foot on the curb and one off Perkins then came out and stood on the right of Cartwright - directly upon that Cartwright took something from his pocket and put it into Birt s hands Birt opened his hand and counted it to give me I suppose an opportunity of seeing what it was and I saw some large pieces of money as there was a strong gas-lamp over them - the clock was striking nine at the time the street is narrow and I was opposite them at a private house elevated on a step - Birt then gave Cartwright something and Perkins held his hand out and took it he held his hand open and turned it over as if looking at it - he then turned round went into the Golden Cans and Cartwright followed him Birt then came across to me and gave me six half-crowns - that was directly after Cartwright had left him and gone round the corner into the public-house Birt gave them to me from the same hand that I saw him receive them in - I never lost sight of him he had no money about him before except what I gave him - these are the six half-crowns I did not take the prisoners then because we had others to take - the prisoner Cartwright was taken on the 15th of January and then we went back again Perkins came in and was taken - I did not take either of them I was waiting in Tothill-street in case they should get away backwards Cross-examined Q Had you marked the six shillings A No Sir Birt was a respectable man but I searched him to satisfy the Jury that he had nothing I can now swear more correctly that he had nothing - I do not know whether it is a licensed public-house or not I am not in the habit of going to that end of the town- I have known Birt between two and three years I have been employed by the Mint eight or nine years - I am not paid by the year or the month I am paid for my loss of time - I sometimes get a crown a day and sometimes less I am paid according to the number of days I am employed -I employed Birt on McCarthy s case but I did not pay him - he is paid by the Mint I was an officer of Surrey for ten years- I did not belong to Union-hall I was a parish constable from year to year - I never was accused of letting a prisoner escape for the sum of 5l I am a tobacconist and live on Newington-causeway - the house is my own and six or seven others I work for the Mint because I think it is my duty - I would not lose my time for government without being paid for it I do not know how much I have received of the Mint in the last twelve months - perhaps 20l or 30l and I have been out for weeks and weeks about it I will swear I have not received 200l or 300l if I had my books here I could tell - I always make a minute of what takes place JAMES GOLLOCKER I am a constable of Lambeth I went on the 15th of January to the three Golden Cans in Tothill-street to take the prisoners Myers Hall Lee and Dunn were with me - I stopped in Laystall-street till I thought the transaction was over I then went to the Golden Cans brushed into the house and caught Cartwright s hand - he had twenty-four half-crowns in it I caught hold of his wrist and turned the half-crowns over into my own hand Birt was then in the passage just by the bar door - I marked the half-crowns and gave them to Lee I did not see Perkins at that time Cross-examined Q Do you know Barnes A Yes we wished him to be here in case there should be any thing particular asked us - he did not come with us this was in the passage of the public-house - the landlady was in the bar WILLIAM LEE I am a constable of Hatton-garden I assisted in taking Cartwright at the Golden Cans I saw him standing at the door talking to Birt - we rushed over and Gollocker took twenty-four half-crowns out of his hand which he marked in my presence and handed over to me - I did not see them in Cartwright s hand but I saw them taken from his hand Cross-examined Q Do you know Barnes A I saw him for the first time on the 15th of January - I do not know that he has been convicted of robbing the East India-house THOMAS DUNN I am a constable of Lambeth Myers asked me to go with them on the 15th of January - I went and saw Cartwright drop a parcel of base coin into one of the officer s hands one of them dropped down one of the party said Perkins calling him by the name of Green was in the tap-room - I went in and asked him if his name was Green he said I was mistaken he was not the party- I ran into the passage to get one of the officers and when I returned he had fled away I returned and we took Cartwright - soon afterwards Perkins came in and was taken I think he had changed his waistcoat - I knownothing of that public-house it was the first time I had been there - there were a parcel of bad women and bad characters there Cross-examined Q You would know a bad character if you saw one A I am in the habit of seeing a great many - I am not acquainted with Barnes I believe he was there on the 15th of January but I do not know that I should know him I think the waistcoat Perkins had on at first was a light colour - there seemed an alteration he came back to the same spot when he thought we were gone I found thirteen penny-pieces and an old rag on him - I should imagine the public-house is licensed there was a man playing a violin and some low characters seemed to be dancing - the landlady was in the bar I do not know whether she saw the transaction JOHN FIELD These are all counterfeit and the same metal as the others JURY to RICHARD MYERS Q From what part of his person did Cartwright get the half-crowns A Apparently from his middle I stood on the step of a door directly opposite Perkins put in a written defence declaring that he had nothing whatever to do with the transaction that he had merely gone into the Golden Cans for some beer and was apprehended PERKINS -

I got eight more half-crowns of Cartwright who stood in the doorway Perkins stood between the bar door and the street door - he handed them to Cartwright to give me and I gave him 8s for them which I had got from Gollocker at the Red Lion in Poppin s-court Fleet-street about twenty minutes before - I had no other money good or bad I did not stay above three or four minutes with the prisoners - I then went to the Red Lion marked the bad money and gave it to Gollocker at the time I bought these half-crowns of the prisoners Gollocker stood opposite in Laystall-street - Cartwright saw him and asked if he was any one belonging to me I said Yes he was a friend of mine Perkins Q What time did you come there A At a quarter after seven o clock - I saw you inside the door with Cartwright - you gave him the eight half-crowns as he was on the cill of the door I then crossed to Gollocker and we went to the Red Lion - you went towards the taproom I do not know whether you went in - when Cartwright gave me the money I went into the street JAMES GOLLOCKER I accompanied Birt and stood opposite under a gas-lamp - I had searched Birt before to throw every doubt aside and he had no money bad or good but what we gave him - he was not out of my sight but just when he went within the door he then came to the door and I saw Cartwright give eight large pieces of money into his hand and he gave Cartwright some money in return Birt then came over to me with the half-crowns and we took them to Poppin s-court RICHARD MYERS I was in a court opposite the public-house - I saw Birt and Cartwright standing inside the door on the threshold and I saw another man behind but I could not distinguish Perkins face I saw their hands going together and directly the dealing was over Birt came over and gave the eight half-crowns to Gollocker - we went away we took the prisoners on the 15th of January Perkins Q How was the door A It was shut when you were inside with him - when you dealt you were between the street door and the swing door - I was in a court which has a baker s-shop at one corner of it I stated on a former occasion that they were half-crowns - you were under a gas-lamp and I could see you distinctly JOHN FIELD These eight half-crowns are all counterfeit and the same as the rest PERKINS -

I marked them at the Rose and Crown and gave them to Myers Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How long have you been employed by the Mint to buy coin A From about the beginning of December - I have been a constable six years I have known Avis three or four months he said he knew who made base coin he gives us information at times - I never paid him any thing nor have I seen him paid I never knew him till the 15th of May I have heard he has been convicted - I did not take the prisoner at the time as we had information that there were four or five coiners in Wentworth-street and we could not have taken them if we took him then I did not induce him to do this - I believe this is the fourth time I have bought coin but will not swear it is not more if I was at home I could refer to some accounts and tell I have been a witness in vmore than ten cases but not bought coin -

I made an arrangement to introduce him to Gollocker and he was to meet him on the 4th of June Avis was the person who gave me information I met Gollocker at the Rose and Crown public-house Goswell-street a little after nine o clock in the morning - I searched him and satisfied myself that he had no coin about him I have known him some time he is a constable - I gave him six good shillings a sixpence and 2d in half-pence - I had no reason to doubt his honesty though I did this I do not employ him he goes as a constable with me -

Gollocker came to me and produced these half-crowns my reason for not taking the prisoner at the time was because we had other parties in view - we made several attempts to take the prisoner afterwards but failed in them till the 22nd of August when I met with Hall and took him at the bottom of Wilson-street -

t18320906-106  1832 HENRY LUCAS was indicted for feloniously forging a bill of exchange which is as follows - Maindenhead June 24 1832 Sirs - Pay to Mr Murdy or order on demand 99l 10s on account of Your obedient servant WILLIAM POLE Messrs Childs Temple-bar London with intent to defraud John Wormald and others 2nd COUNT for uttering the same knowing it to be forged with the like intent 3rd COUNT for forging an endorsement on the said bill in the name of Edward Murdy 4th COUNT for feloniously uttering the said endorsement MR ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution JOHN WORMALD JUN I am a clerk in the banking-house of Messrs Childs and Co my father John Wormald is the senior partner - there are four others On the 3rd of July I was present in the banking-house when the prisoner came and produced a bill of exchange for payment he was asked how he came by it and said he had it in a letter from France that morning I do not know whether he said from Calais or not - we detained him he told us where he lodged - we sent an officer to the place and he brought two letters looking at the bill - I believe this to be an imitation of the signature of Sir William Pole who has kept cash at our house eighteen years Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q At what time did he come A Between three and four o clock he presented the draft to another clerk who handed it to me for examination and the prisoner was desired to walk into another room which he did he was then told in my presence that we suspected it to be a forgery and that he must account for the way he came in possession of it - he said he had it in a letter which he received that morning from France and may have mentioned the town for what I know- he wrote a letter himself to desire the letters might be given up to the officer who came back within two hours or it might be but one hour but I went home within two hours of the transaction he remained in our counting-house waiting the officer s return and gave us the information without the least hesitation - this erasure was on the draft when I received it MR ADOLPHUS Q Could he have got away A Not very well there was an officer in the adjoining room - he said he received the draft from a person named Emerson that he had received that letter from him that he was acquainted with Emerson but what else I do not recollect the draft was presented between three and fouro clock I dined at the banking-house at four - I came from dinner soon after five o clock and left at half-past COURT Q How does Sir William Pole sign his name to drafts A In the manner this is signed Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE POLE BART Previous to the discovery of this forgery I always drew drafts in the name of William only - not a letter of this draft is in my writing it very much resembles it certainly but I have not the least hesitation in swearing not a letter of it is my writing nor do I know the person in whose favour it is drawn Cross-examined Q Did a female in the name of Emerson apply to you for charity A Many years ago a woman describing herself as the wife of a clerk in the Custom-house applied to me and begged as a matter of charity that I would take some drawings of her and I gave her what I considered more than the value of them I frequently relieved her till at last I found her applications troublesome - I never saw her and do not know her age Q Did you not send her a cheque for 3l A She sent me a letter previous to the 23rd of April this year and I sent a respectable tradesman to inquire if she was a fit object of charity I sent her a cheque for 3l 1s - the 1s was to cover the expences of postage that was this year Q So that if she happened to have a son he had an opportunity of seeing your hand-writing A Yes MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you empower her or any body else to draw in your name A Never - I know nothing of the prisoner - the draft was here put in and read JOHN CHADWICK I am an officer of the City Police I was called into Child s banking-house and saw the prisoner there I stood in the banking-house and heard Mr Wormald ask how he came by the cheque he said he had it in a letter from France from a person named William Emerson that he was quite innocent of knowing it to be forged and was very sorry he had had any thing to do with it - he did not in my presence say how he became acquainted with Emerson I remained there while Edwards went to his lodging he was gone about an hour or an hour and three-quarters and brought two letters with him - while he was gone the prisoner said nothing to me about Emerson Cross-examined Q Did you remain in the same room with the prisoner A I did not all the time - he wished to write a letter I was absent from the room all the time Edwards was gone - I did not tell him I was going to wait Q For what he knew you might be gone A Yes I am sure he told Mr Wormald he was quite innocent of knowing any thing of the forgery - he manifested no inclination to escape when asked how he came by the draft I believe he gave an answer without hesitation - while Edwards was gone he wrote a letter which I took from him he gave it to me to send to France but I told him I should take possession of it and keep it it was not sealed I had my officer s uniform on MR ADOLPHUS Q It was undirected as well as unsealed A Yes I took it from him he did not give it to me - there were several people in the banking-house backwards and forwards and five or six clerks quite sufficient to detain him if he attempted to escape MR PHILLIPS Q How came the letter not directed A Because I took it from him he said he wanted it to go to Emerson in France - he did not say to what part - I took it from him before he had an opportunity of directing it I took it from him because I thought it would be the means of enabling other persons to escape JOHN EDWARDS I belonged to the City Police but have since resigned I was fetched to Child s bankinghouse and received a paper from a clerk who directed me to No 23 Barret-street Vauxhall - it is about two miles and a half from Child s I went and saw Mrs Elsgood the landlady of the house - I made application for a letter having left directions with her not to give them to any body but his aunt - she would not give them up but on telling her who I was she gave me these two letters in the ground floor back room - she took them out of a trunk - I had no conversation with the prisoner about them MR CHARLES TENNANT JUN I am one of the firm of Tennant Harrison and Co our house are the acting solicitors for Child s house but we have given the formal part of this business out of our hands When the prisoner was taken into custody I was fetched to the banking-house and saw him there - he said he had been for some time living about the town that he was formerly clerk to Richards Clark and Co of Lincoln s Inn-fields but not liking the profession of the law he had quitted it and that he been entirely dependent since he left their office on the charity of his aunt Mrs or Miss Langton - I think he said she was unable to support him being in very indifferent circumstances herself and that she had been without any occupation for some time with regard to his knowledge of Emerson he said he had met him but a short time before this at a billiard-table that his acquaintance with Emerson was very slight - I remarked on his making an acquaintance at a billiard-room and asked how he could undertake to tender that bill for payment received under such suspicious circumstances meaning the slight acquaintance he had and meeting him only at a billiard-room - he said Emerson had left London to go to Calais only about three days before I asked if he had any idea or notion why Emerson went over to Calais - he said he did not know why he went and that the circumstance of his sending the bill had excited his surprise and made him suspect there was something wrong about it the rest of our conversation related principally to a letter he wrote to his aunt enclosing the letter he had received from Emerson - he said he had enclosed the letter he received from Emerson to his aunt the letter he spoke of was then in my hands looking at two letters - these are them I asked him if this letter was his writing he said it was - I expressed my regret at the production of that letter and stated to him that letter showed a guilty knowledge - he was a good deal confused at that and said he certainly had some suspicion about the transaction when he wrote that letter Cross-examined Q Did he confine his acquaintance with this young man to the billiard-room A Entirely - he said he first became acquainted with him in a billiard room and that he had a short acquaintance with him since- I did not ask him the precise time that the acquaintance began I asked how long he had known him and he said a short time - I did not press that inquiry further I did not ask if he had visited Emerson at the Clarence hotel nor whether he had gone to Bath with him - he admitted at once that the letter was his hand-writing he told me he was to receive from Emerson a sum of money when he delivered the proceeds of the bill I cannot tell the precise sum I certainly asked him - I think it was about 15l but am not sure about it Q Did you ask how it happened that he was to receive 15l A I did - his answer was that it was for his trouble I have been an attorney about fifteen years I made these inquiries with a view of seeing whether I could with propriety advise his discharge - I had not the slightest notion of giving evidence when I came into Court and I reluctantly give it I did not expect to be called - I did not tell our agent what had passed between me and the prisoner - a note was sent up to me to know if I could confirm Mr Wormald s evidence and I have confirmed it - I believe it is stated in the brief that Mr Wormald would prove the prisoner s stating his acquaintance with Emerson commenced in a billiard-room as I thought he was present - I believe I stated in the brief the heads of which I drew up myself the conversation I had with the prisoner and that the acquaintance began in a billiard-room but I have had no conversation with the agent about it MR ADOLPHUS Q Is Mr Harrison who sits by me instructing me in the case your partner A Yes - I drew out general instructions for the brief but have never seen the brief itself I drew up what was necessary for it I cautioned the prisoner all along against making commucation to me and when I saw this letter I told him not to say another word as the law must take its course - Letters read No 1 Simmond s Hotel Calais July 2 1832 DEAR HARRY - We arrived here on Saturday morning at one o clock so you see we came over here in sixteen hours - I have enclosed in this a draft on Messrs Childs and Co for 99l 10s which you must go and get and then meet me in Paris at the Poste-restant or office as quick as possible you will have to sign your name at the back of the draft when you get it and come to me immediately -

I asked his name and address he gave me Edward Watkins No 1 New-street Cannon-street-road which I immediately wrote on the note - this is it looking at it - instead of giving him change from the till intending to see if he continued agitated I called for my cash-box out of the back room and pretended to be turning the key I then turned up the note he had given me and said This is a forgery and you know it he said For God s sake don t make any noise can I speak to you in a private room I desired him to walk in which he did - he then said I hope you don t consider I am a passer of forged notes I said I did not know what he was but I must see - I then asked how many more he had got about him he said Why don t you think I am innocent I replied Every man is innocent till he is found guilty and again asked him how many more he had got he said he had but one -

I asked him to tell me the sign he said he could not tell but he would point it out- I would not let him walk before me thinking he meant to run away Cross-examined Q Did he not tell you the house was in Maiden-lane A No I did not ask him where it was he said there where two young men in the house and that was all he stated - I could have got assistance to go with him to point the house out if I had chosen MR SIMPSON The note No 2347 is the one he offered in payment of the 6s I wrote the address he gave me on it in the shop -

I have lived there about eleven years and keep the house no Edward Watkins lived there in October the prisoner did not live there Cross-examined Q Did he ever live there A No I have often seen him in the street and have known his father five or six years and in that way I knew him his father kept a public-house but is now dead - I used to see him about his father s house I knew where he lived when his father kept the house - that was four years ago but not more he never came to see me or my family I never heard of his being at my house Davison lodged at my house - the prisoner might visit him for what I know - I have seen him with Davison in the street I swear I never saw him in my house - he might have come to see Davison but not in my presence MR FOLLET Q Did the prisoner lodge at your house A Never I did not know him by the name of Watkins - his father s name was Hayes WILLIAM FRANCIS MIDDLETON I live in Grenada-terrace Commercial-road and am a watchmaker and goldsmith To the best of my belief the prisoner is the man who came on Monday the 27th of August to my shop he asked to look at a gold-chain which I showed him and asked four guineas for he said it was rather too much and asked to look at some seals and he selected one for which I asked him 35s there was another man with him- they talked it over among themselves I am quite sure the prisoner is not the other man - he was much stouter he said he would give me a guinea and a half which I agreed to take and he tendered me a 5l note as I thought it to be - the prisoner I believe to be the person who tendered it to the best of my recollection he took it out of his waistcoat-pocket - I took it and asked his name and address which he gave I wrote it on the back of the note this is it looking at it he gave me Mr Evans No 1 Curser-street - I asked him where Curser-street was he said just at the top of the road - I was then satisfied and took the note and gave him the seal with three sovereigns and 8s 6d from my pocket - I wrote the address on the note in his presence Cross-examined Q Were you at Bow-street A Yes last Monday week I was not sworn - I refused to swear to the prisoner but at the same time expressed my confidence that he was the man but when he tendered me the note he had very bushy whiskers and he was then without whiskers which made a very great alteration that was my only reason for refusing to swear to him - I do not swear to him now he has no whiskers now but there is still the same countenance - I discovered the note to be forged about five weeks after MR FOLLET Q I suppose you had parted with it A Yes and it was returned to me JOHN WARNER I am shop-boy to Mr Middleton The prisoner is the person who paid him the note on the 27th of August - he had whiskers then Cross-examined Q How is it you mention the 27th of August so exactly A I put it down on a piece of paper when I was copying some poetry that day after he left - I wrote the date down carelessly as I was writing I burnt it among other papers a day or two afterwards MR GURNEY Q Did you afterwards hear the note was forged A Yes and my master sent me to look for Curser-street but I could find no such street MR PHILLIPS Q Do you mean that going to look for the street and hearing the note was forged impresses the 27th of August on your mind A I heard my master say it was the 27th and I am positive that was the date - I kept it in my mind COURT Q Had you any reason for writing down the 27th of August more than that you recollect that was the day A No I wrote it carelessly on a bit of paper JOSHUA FREEMAN I am an inspector of Bank notes These three notes are forged in every respect paper plate and signatures - they are both from the same plate and the signatures appear to be the same hand-writing Cross-examined Q Is the style like the hand-writing of the clerk A It is not a good imitation Prisoner s Defence written My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - Possessed of a small independence and having much leisure time upon my hands I have been in the habit of frequenting many places of public resort at one of which about two months previous to this unfortunate transaction it was my misfortune to meet with a young man named Lane - from his gentlemanly and prepossessing manner I felt disposed to encourage the intimacy indeed so great was my confidence in him that but a short time after the commencement of our acquaintance I without the least hesitation acceeded to his request for the loan of 10s and would willingly have lent him a larger sum On the morning of the day in question I met Lane and accepted his invitation to pass the evening with him - according to my appointment I met Lane and with him proceeded to a coffee-house in Catherine-street Strand where we met two other persons with whom Lane was acquainted and of whom I had some slight knowledge we afterwards went to a tavern in Maiden-lane when after some preliminary conversation Lane alluded to the 10s owing to me by him and jestingly alluding to my taste in articles of dress he asked me if I would have any objection to execute a little commission for him of that nature he mentioned a particular description of silk handkerchief of the same pattern as one which I myself had mentioned as possessing and a similar one he was desirous of having he therefore asked me if I would oblige him by purchasing a handkerchief of the same pattern and at the same time two black silk handkerchiefs - he took a 5l note from his pocket and gave it to me for the purpose of making the purchase observing that I could repay myself the 10s he had borrowed of me As I was about leaving the room one of the persons we had met with at the coffee-house asked me if I would be kind enough to execute a similar commission for him I answered Yes willingly and he took a note-case from his pocket in which there was a 5l note which he gave to me with the case I then went to Mr Simpson s shop in New-street Covent-garden and asked for the articles for Lane first for which I tendered his note wishing to keep each commission separate - Mr Simpsons declared the note to be a forgery and asked whether I had any more in my possession I instantly produced the other note and told him where the parties for whom I was acting could instantly be found he however gave me in custody to a Policeman to whom I repeated where the parties were to be found and requested him to accompany me to the house where they were but this he refused to do HENRY HAMMOND I am waiter at the Peacock Maiden-lane I remember four young men coming there last Monday fortnight - I am not certain whether the prisoner was one of them Seven witnesses gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 30 - Transported for Life Strongly recommended to Mercy by the Jury and Prosecutor on account of his character

he was in my husband s debt 35l he came to our house that day in my husband s absence - he said he came to settle his debt - he was then living in Edward-street and was a baker it is about three-quarters of a mile from our house - he gave me 10l in money and this hill he asked me if I thought Mr Brook would have any objections to take the bill I said I should think not if it was a good one I know no reason why he should not - he replied As for the bill being good it is as good as the Bank of England - all the parties are highly respectable he said You see the acceptor is Watson the army-agent of Charlotte-street Portman-place - I had heard of such a person he pointed to the name of G Carew the endorser and he said that was the person he took it of I gave him credit in the ledger while he stood there for the bill and cash that settled his account and 5s over was the interest on the bill - between that time and the bill becoming due he got into our debt 81l odd and paid 12l of it - we gave him credit to a larger amount on the belief that this was a genuine transaction Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q How long did your husband deal with the prisoner A I do not know he used to fetch goods away and pay cash for them I never took a bill from him before I did not know that he kept more than one shop I never heard the name of Chesney mentioned till he was at the office - he did not say Carew had been represented to him as respectable but said the bill was as goods as the Bank - bill read JOSEPH BROOK I am a corn-dealer On the 27th of July 1830 when I came home I received this bill from my wife - I thought it genuine - I called on the prisoner two or three days after he asked me if I liked the bill - I said I did as I found the acceptors very respectable persons I had not inquired of the acceptors as to its genuiness only of the respectability of the firm - he said they were the parties who bad accepted it and he was sorry he could not pay me money as he was forced to take that bill in part of money from George Carew - he said Carew had taken it of Duff and that they were all respectable persons - and he knew all the parties very well I parted with him and paid the bill into my banker s Sir Claude Scott - it was returned to me on the 17th of September it was due on the 16th there was then written on it No knowledge of acceptor - I went I think on the same day to Darby in Edward-street Regent s-park and told him the bill was returned as having no knowledge of the acceptors he said that was very strange but that Carew was out of town and Duff was with his regiment - that Carew would be in town in a few days and he should be able to settle the bill he then said that Carew lived in Edward-street - I think he said it was No 3 I will not swear he said No 3 but the house he then told me Carew lived in I swear I went to he said Duff was in the second regiment of Life Guards - I found the house in Edward-street he referred me to and found no such person as Carew lived there I went to several houses but could hear of no such person - there was then about four houses at one end of the street and five or six more at the other end the other houses have been built since I went to three or four at the end he described to me and made every inquiry about the neighbourhood but could not find Carew - I then made inquiry about Duff and could not find any such person I afterwards took the bill myself to Watson and Co s Charlotte-street Portland-place and learnt that it was forged before the bill became due I had given him credit to the amount of 80l and received 12l of it I gave him that credit on the faith that this bill was a genuine transaction - he is now in my debt 96l 8s 6d he lulled me on for several days before I suspected anything - I could have apprehended him but did not think that he had any thing to do with it - I had not discovered that there was no such persons as Carew and Duff at the end of six or seven days I went to look for the prisoner and found his shop shut up and could not find him - I saw his son I have never seen him since till I apprehended him in the Corn-market in December last I never saw him in the Corn-market during that interval in my life nor ever in the New-road I never saw him nod his head to me there when I took him I said I have never seen you since you left your shop in Edward-street since you gave me that bill which turned out to be a forgery - he said Walk alongwith me now and we will settle it I said I can t run after you now - I got an officer who took him Cross-examined Q How long had he dealt with you Perhaps two or three months A I never heard of his having three shops - he never mentioned the name of Chesney to me I knew he was doing business in Regent s-park barracks he had a bakehouse there once - he never told me Chesney had told him Duff belonged to the 17th Light Dragoons -

I went to a great many as I knew Messrs Watson and was surprised at the answer I could find no Mr Brown WILLIAM FRANCIS WATSON I live with my father William Watson an army-agent No 60 Charlotte-street Portland-place - he had lived there thirteen or fourteen years there are no other Watsons army-agents living any where in London - a list of army-agents is published under the authority of the Secretary at War I have examined that- I accept bills for my father and sometimes my father does so - no other person was authorized to accept bills in 1830- this acceptance is not in the hand-writing of myself or my father nor of any person in his employ my father does not bank with Brown and Co Abchurch-lane I know nothing of Mr Duff the drawer or Carew the endorser Cross-examined Q Do you do business for the 17th Light Dragoons or 2nd Life Guards A No I do not know an officer named Duff - nobody of that name did business at our house Mr Brook presented the bill to us in 1830 - I do not think it was before it came due MR CLARKSON Q When he called did you tell him it was a forgery A The last time he called I did - if genuine we should have paid it JAMES MEE I am cashier in the house of Brown and Co bankers Abchurch-lane Mr Watson does not keep cash at our house nor did he in 1830 - I have been in the house about fourteen years they never kept cash at our house during that time nor have we had customers of that name for the last seven years in London COURT Q Have Brown and Co lived in Abchurch-lane the fourteen years you have been there A Yes I never heard of any other Brown and Co there during that time SARAH WILD I am the wife of Thomas Wild and live at No 7 Edward-street Regent s-park I formerly lived at No 6 the numbers in the street have been altered No 6 was formerly No 3 both 6 and 7 are shops -

we had the first floor there were four families in the house - I was acquainted with them all COURT Q Was there any family named Carew A No for I let the lodgings and must have known THOMAS PLAYFORD I am a corporal in the second regiment of Life Guards I have been in the regiment upwards of twenty years during the last seven years no person named Duff has held a commission in that regiment Cross-examined Q Do you know any body of that name A I do not I do not know the officers of the 14th Hussars MR CLARKSON Q Have you examined to ascertain if such a person was in the regiment A I am the regiment clerk and have examined the books there has been no Duff in the regiment either a commissioned officer or not THOMAS DEVEY I am beadle of Aldgate ward On the 10th of December I received the prisoner in charge from Mr Brook who charged him with uttering a forged bill he said Mr Brook you need not give charge of me - if you will step on one side I will make it all right Brook said he should do no such thing and told me to do my duty the prisoner said it was very hard and very strange of Mr Brook that he had an opportunity of seeing him several times on the Corn-market and on one occasion he met him in the New-road and he nodded his head to Mr Brook who nodded to him again I found twenty or thirty cards on him Cross-examined Q Did he not say I am surprised at this - I thought the bill had been paid A He did not nor did he say I must pay the bill because I know I am liable to it JAMES FELL I am chief clerk to the Magistrates of Marylebone-office I produce a book in which I took notes of the examination of the prisoner I took down what fell from his mouth neither threat nor promise were made to him - he said I am in the habit of dealing with Mr Brook the bill came into my hands through Mr Chesney of Carnaby-market - he took it of Duff Chesney said You may rely on its being good - I gave him 10l and the residue of the bill he did not endorse it - I did not request him to do so I paid it to Mr Brook - I have repeatedly seen Mr Brook since this was on the 11th of December - On that day week he was again examined and said I unfortunately did not get the man Chesney to endorse the bill - the man that paid me the bill The prisoner put in a long written Defence stating that at the period in question he was in the habit of supplying John Young of Drury-lane and Thomas Chesney of High-street Bloomsbury since deceased with bread - that he had discounted the bill for Chesney taking 15l which he was indebted to him and that Chesney had represented that he had received it from Duff an officer of the 14th Hussars that he disposed of his businessthe latter end of October on account of the Insanity of his wife with whom he retired into the country among her friends and in twelve months returned to London took a situation in Wheeler-street and subsequently went into business in Blackmoor-street JOHN YOUNG I have been a Sheriff s officer - I am out of any thing now I have ceased to be a Sheriff s officer for two years I sold bread for the prisoner at No 166 Drury-lane till the end of October or the beginning of November 1830 I knew a man named Chesney - he lived up by Carnaby-market and was selling bread for the prisoner in the same way as I was between St Giles church and Tottenham-court-road he died in the Marshalsea prison six months ago - I know this bill of exchange I have seen it in the hands of Chesney - he brought it to me to discount it for him about the month of June 1830 I think but I cannot be sure we were very intimate at the time - he was at my shop almost every day he told me if I would get it discounted for him that it was drawn by an officer in the army accepted by an agent and made payable at a banker s I told him when he called on me a second time I could not do any thing with it - his answer was that he could get Mr Darby to do it but he owned him 15l and he was afraid Darby would stop the 15l out of the bill this bill is exactly in the same state as when shown to me MR CLARKSON Q Were you a Sheriff s officer or a follower A I was an officer s man two years ago before that I was an officer - I had some business of my own and took it to what officer I liked I have had a sufficiency to maintain me for the last twenty years - I have ceased to be an officer five years - I may go to Serjeant s Inn three or four times in a Term I never hired sham bail I have hired persons to put in bail above when I was an officer - they had half a crown each Q You say this bill was in the same state when you saw it in Chesney s hands A Yes I was examined before the Magistrate - I have not said that Carew s name was on it then I was looking at the body of the bill - I do not know whether Carew s name was on it or not when I saw it in Chesney s hands I might tell the Magistrate that that name was not there when I saw it - I do not know that it was not there I swore at the officer that it was not and it was not - I paid the prisoner so much out of every loaf I sold on my own account - I kept the shop I had a halfpenny out of every quartern loaf and sold two hundred a day perhaps a man named Williams lived in the house Chesney sold in the same way as far as I knew - there was no name over either shop - Chesney was about a twelve months at the shop and left about October 1830 I sold for the prisoner till the beginning of November - I saw Chesney about three weeks before his death he lived up by Carnaby-market and he lived there when he was selling for the prisoner and before the prisoner left off business - I should suppose the prisoner knew where to find him I did not hear the bill was forget till the prisoner was apprehended - I have not seem Chesney with the prisoner since 1830 he could be found at any time before he died - I know he was in the Marshaleoa a long time before he died I did not know Duff - Chesney told me he was in the army - I have not been arrested for the last ten years- I saw the prisoner in Wheeler-street once or twice in 1830 Chesney lived in Carnaby-market till he was taken to the Marchalsea but he was out in the country and he told me he had been hopping I swear I sold bread on commission for the prisoner in October 1830 - I do not think he left his shop in Regent s-park before the 29th of September - I think I sold bread for him after that MR BARRY Q Are you sure you sold bread for him in October A I am pretty sure I did I remember his disposing of his business in Edward-street - his wife was out of her mind at that time and went into the country to her friends I saw the prisoner in the Corn-market early in 1831 - he used to call on me when he came to town I had no reason to suppose he was keeping out of the way -I did not know George Carew if the prisoner had asked me where Chesney was I could have told him but not in 1831 when he was hopping CHARLES CROZIER I am serjeant-armourer to the 1st regiment of Life guards - I live in Clarence-street Regent s-park I lived there in 1820 and the latter end of 1830 - I know the prisoner very well I remember his leaving his shop in Edward-street some time in October- I believe his wife was not in her right senses at that time that was the reason of his going away - I saw him afterwards in the neighbourhood he called on me for some money I owed him - he called only once I saw him many times after - he was seeking for a shop or something to get his bread there he went round to collect debts due to him MR CLARKSON Q Did you know Chesney A No my duty is to clean the arms - I knew the prisoner as a neighbour I was pretty well acquainted with the neighbourhood - I did not know George Carew living there the 2nd Life Guards sometimes quartered at our barracks - I never heard of Captain Duff the prisoner s wife was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to our house till within a week of his leaving - she generally came alone Q Where did the prisoner go to in the country A He said he was going to his father he expected to be able to do better for his family as his friends lived there -I do not think I saw his wife after he left till within the last week she was at my house she appears to be in her right senses now - I do not know that any doctor attended her I knew she was not in her right mind from the way she addressed herself to my wife - I knew they did not live comfortable together on account of her mind I cannot swear that he did not leave his house before the 29th of September MR BARRY Q Are you satisfied from your observation of his wife that she was not in her right senses A That is my opinion JAMES WARREN I am a cheesemonger and live in Portpool-lane but did live at No 31 St Mary-street Hampstead-road when the prisoner became a lodger of mine which was in the middle of October 1830 - I had known him a very little time before he brought in some furniture and was there about six weeks he took his family into the country but always boarded with me when he came to town - his family were with him just when they came in he was there in July following once or twice a week July 1831 - Mary-street is near Regent s-park MR CLARKSON Q You are sure it was in October 1830 A Yes quite about the middle I think but am not positive - I cannot swear he did not come before the 30th of September Mary-street is about seven minutes walk from Regent s-park - he remained six weeks before he took his furniture away and he came backwards and forwards till July - I do not think he was away four days together from October till July after his furniture was gone he slept next door and boarded with me - he carried on no business in town he was backwards and forwards in the country on business - when he went into the country he did not come home for two or three days he never told me he had received a forged bill from a man named Chesney - his family went into Suffolk they were about six weeks in my house but his wife was not with them till the day he took her to the country - he has four children I went to St Pancras parish for a strait-waistcoat for his wife in October 1830 Q On your oath did he not come to you before the 30th of October A Not to my knowledge I once saw his wife and she was almost delirious that was about the middle of October - I do not know Carew I knew the prisoner when he lived in Edward-street - he came to my house from there his brother married my wife s sister - I never heard him talk of Chesney nor of Duff I do not believe he was ever away seven days together for if he went away he left word that if any body wanted him he should be in town in three days - I cannot swear he did not come to me before the 29th of September he brought his goods to my house about seven o clock in the morning MR BARRY Q Had you reason to believe he was avoiding or shunning any body A None in the least - I went round the neighbourhood with him to collect debts COURT Q From the time he came to you till July 1831 did you know him to be baking bread to supply persons A I cannot say I did if he had I think I should have known it JOHN HILL I am a carpenter and builder I live in Clarence-street Regent s-park I was the landlord of the house which the prisoner kept in 1830 - he left about the middle of October after quarter-day but I cannot say the exact day - he attended his business regularly and paid me my rent MR CLARKSON Q Did you ever see Chesney in his company A I never heard the name nor of Carew or Duff I know he left after quarter-day because the person who took the house after him paid me the rent directly he took possession - the prisoner had a lease from me for ninety-six years I first heard of him giving up the lease in the middle of October soon after he left - he had given me no intimation of it but I saw the shop shut up - I know he had just left for only one house parted us and I used to see him frequently every day MR CLARKSON to CHARLES CROZIER Q Was not you out of town with your regiment when you say you saw the prisoner after he left A No my regiment left in July 1830 and staid out of town twelve months - I was in the habit of seeing him after that we removed from Regent s-park barracks in 1830 to Knightsbridge - I was at Windsor from 1831 to 1832 FRANCIS DRAKE I sell flour on commission I have known the prisoner ten years - I have been in the habit of attending the Corn-market for the last twelve months during that time I have seen the prisoner there regularly twice a week - he kept a shop lately in Blackmoor-street Clare-market for about twelve months I kept the same shop seven years ago -

I think I have heard of the name I never knew the prisoner dealing for them - I was in the habit of supplying the army with bread I knew the prisoner by his keeping a shop near the barracks - he kept what is called a second rate shop I knew the 2nd Life Guards and served them for ten years at times -

the prisoner also lodged there On Thursday the 10th of January I had some conversation with him in the evening in the course of which he showed me a bill - looking at the bill this is it he showed it to me and remarked that he would pay my landlord Mr Newson the amount of his bill if he could give him change for a 100l bill he then put this bill into my hand - I read it over and remarked that it was drawn out in a very unusual form he answered that it was drawn out by a lady - this was about ten o clock at night on seeing him next evening when he had reached the stairs leading to his bed-room I called after him and asked him if he had got his bill cashed - he returned to me and said he had no knowledge of having shown me the bill and said he had not got it cashed but he should get it cashed in the country Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You remarked on the extraordinary nature of the bill A Yes I never saw one begin in that style before - it is the clumsiest performance I ever saw I cannot make the name to the acceptance Coke - it does not purport to be endorsed by Bloom I never saw an endorsement begin with Messrs JOSEPH NEWSON I live at No 30 Cumberland-street Hackney-road - the prisoner lodged with me for about three weeks before he was apprehended On Thursday the 10th of January he came home about ten o clock at night and appeared to be in liquor - he asked if I could give him change for a bin he owed me about two guineas - I asked him the amount of the bill he said it was a 400l bill - I did not read it myself it was shown to Mr Woodcock in my presence he had lodged at No 26 in the same street previous to coming to my house he was not lodging there in January Cross-examined Q Did you think him in his senses A He was drunk he told me he had come to town to receive a legacy of 80l for his wife WILLIAM COVINGTON SEN I am principal clerk in the country office of Messrs Barclay s bank On the 11th of January last I received a letter by the two penny-post enclosing a bill of exchange - this is the letter and bill looking at them see letter No 1 - I gave them into the hands of Mr Bevan one of the firm ROBERT COOPER LEE BEVAN ESQ I am one of the firm of Barclay and Co - Mr John Heaton Tritton is the senior partner there are four partners besides him This letter and the bill it enclosed were handed to me by Mr Covington on Friday the 11th of January - I made a communication to Mr Samson Hanbury on the subject in writing this is the letter I sent - it was sent by John Bull our porter and about twelve o clock the next day Saturday I received this letter looking at it - No 2 from one of our clerks Mr Robert Hanbury came in while I was reading it - I showed him the letter and in consequence of what he said I went out to inquire who had brought it I found the prisoner there and asked him if he was the bearer of that letter - he said he was Mr Robert Hanbury was at that time in the partners room not in the office where the prisoner was I desired the prisoner to take a seat while I saw more about it he asked whether he had not better call again he saw me go to a clerk to desire him to look after him upon which he immediately begged to speak to me in private - I should not think he heard what I said to the clerk I took him into a private part of our premises - he then said he had never done such a thing before and begged me to let him go for the sake of his wife and family for he had been driven to it by distress - he repeated this application to me several times and he fell down on his knees I desired an officer to be fetched - Furrester came and he was taken into custody I had no previous knowledge of him Cross-examined Q Was he drunk when he came to you A Not at all it would be impossible for this forgery to escape detection on a view of it - it is very clumsily done a person used to bills would see that it was out of the ordinary course - Mr Coke of Norfolk does not keep cash with us MR BODKIN Q Do you ever find that bills coming from the country between persons not in trade are drawn hadly A Yes many country bills are drawn very bad HARRY NORRIS I am cashier to Messrs Barclay On the 12th of January the prisoner came to me and delivered this letter - on his giving me this letter he accompanied it with an inquiry which I did not understand at the time - but mentioning the name of Mr Hanbury I looked at the letter and seeing it was addressed to the house I desired him to take it into an inner room where it would be conveyed to the partner he then repeated his question asking if we had not heard from Mr Samson Hanbury respecting a bill - I then asked him if he knew the contents of the letter he said that he did - I then opened the letter as he said it alluded to a bill - he said nothing else that I recollect - I opened the letter and took it to Mr Covington who came forward and asked who had brought the letter I pointed to the prisoner and he went into a private room with him ROBERT HANBURY ESQ I am a partner in the house of Hanbury and Co Brick-lane On Saturday the 12thof January I came to business at ten o clock in the morning and found the prisoner waiting in my counting-house - I believe him to be the man but did not take much notice of him I learned from him that he came to make inquiry about a bill - he said the bill was at Barclays - he said he was clerk to Messrs Oxley and English and was sent by Messrs Barclays to make the inquiry about the bill I do not recollect his saying why he was sent - he did not say why it was necessary to make inquiry about the bill I told him I knew nothing about it - Mr Samson Hanbury my uncle was not in town that day - he only comes to town on a Thursday once a week I said nothing to the prisoner about Mr Samson Hanbury while I was talking to him my attention was called to a letter addressed to Mr Samson Hanbury - this is the letter it was brought to me by one of the clerks from the letter-box unopened - on inquiring about the bill one of the clerks said in the prisoner s hearing that there was a letter from Barclays which might refer to the subject and this letter was produced - I opened it in the prisoner s presence read it and said to the prisoner I will inquire about it he immediately left - I gave him no letter to take to Barclays nor was any given him by my direction I have a clerk named James Young but no William Young - looking at a letter No 2 this is not the handwriting of Young my clerk nor of any person in our establishment the prisoner left me about a quarter after ten o clock and soon after twelve I called myself at Barclays bank while I was there the letter signed Young was shown to me - I saw the prisoner at Barclays on that occasion and in consequence of what I said he was taken into a private room by Mr Bevan - he fell down on his knees and addressed himself to me Cross-examined Q Did you ever see a bill drawn in such a manner before A It is very clumsily done but in the country they are very often very curiously drawn - we do not bank at Barclay s DANIEL FORRESTER I am one of the City Police In consequence of information on the 12th of January I took the prisoner into custody at Barclay s bank I searched and found a key on him looking at several letters and papers I found all these on his person - in consequence of something I observed on the letters I went to No 26 Cumberland-street and saw Mr Purchase who brought me a box which I tried the key to and it opened it - in the box I found several papers and letters in consequence of the directions on some of them I went to Brisley in Norfolk - I found some letters there WILLIAM PURCHASE I live at No 26 Cumberland-street I recollect Forrester coming to my house on the 12th of January - I showed him a box which belonged to the prisoner Cross-examined Q I believe you knew him when he lived in the country A Yes he was about nine weeks at my house - I have known him altogether about five years he bore the character of a respectable honest man - he was formerly a schoolmaster but latterly kept a new beer-shop JAMES YOUNG I am a clerk in Mr Hanbury s house Brick-lane - I am the only Young in their employ This letter is not my hand-writing nor the writing of any body in the house MISS MARY BLOOM I did live at Wells I now live at Norwich - I never lived at Walsingham my father had a small estate at Walsingham - he sold it some years before his death he died last July three years - I do not know the distance of Brisley from Walsingham I never sold any land at Walsingham - this signature to the bill is not my hand-writing Cross-examined Q It is not your name A No my name is not Mary Ann - I never sold any land to Mr Coke of Norfolk I know him very well - my father sold his land to a Mr Brook it might be three or four years before he died - Mr Coke did not owe me 400l MR BODKIN Q Is Brisley in the neighbourhood of Walsingham A Yes but I do not know the distance DANIEL FORRESTER Brisley is eleven miles from Walsingham SAMSON HANBURY ESQ I am one of the firm of Hanbury and Company of Brick-lane0 Looking at a letter with a post-mark dated the 23rd of November No 3 this is my hand-writing there is something under the signature which is not my writing I wrote the letter in consequence of an application for assissance from R S No 26 Cumberland-street Hackney-road - looking at another letter No 1 this is not my hand-writing not one word of it - the name is something like my signature I do not think it much like the signature to the letter I wrote the same characters are used the letter was not written by my authority at all the endorsement Samson Hanbury on the bill is not my hand-writing nor written by my authority - I never saw the bill till it was shown to me after the prisoner was taken HENRY VICRY WILSON I am a clerk in the banking establishment of Messrs Hammersly I am acquainted with the hand-writing of Mr Coke of Norfolk this acceptance is certainly not in his hand-writing it is an attempt to imitate it but a very bad one Cross-examined Q A very clumsy performance altogether A Yes JOHN ENGLISH I am a partner in the firm of Oxley English and Oxley of Lynn Norfolk The prisoner was never a clerk in our house I have no reason to suppose this bill was ever in possession of our house - the endorsement is not our writing Cross-examined Q The firm is not properly described on the bill A Yes it is English and Co we do not endorse bills in this way with Messrs before the name nor write Lynn under it I see many bills in the country drawn as clumsily and should not object to take such a bill if I knew the person I know nothing of the prisoner - Lynn is about twenty-five miles from Walsingham MR BODKIN Q How long have you lived at Lyon A Twenty-four years - there is no other firm of our name The following letters were read No 1 SIRS - I beg to say the enclosed bill which I have endorsed should you think proper to cash I will stand account able for the owner will call in the course of the day should you not think proper to comply with the same I will thank you to return the bill to me S HANBURY Brick-lane To Barclay Tritton and Co No 54 Lombard-street Saturday morning No 2 SIRS - In answer to your letter received last night respecting the bill of acceptance endorsed by Mr S Hanbury I beg to say the same is perfectly right the bearer of this note is the person to whom the bill belongs - I am for S Hanbury Brick-lane W YOUNG Clerk No 3 - To R S No 26 Cumberland-street SIR - As you request a line from me in reply to your letter of yesterday I beg to say it is not agreeable to me to interfere in the affairs of a stranger S HANBURY At the bottom of this letter several attempts had been made to imitate the signature other papers were found on the prisoner which were produced upon which were written the name of F Joke or Coke several times also the words accepted and payable at Mr Gurney s bank Fakenham the form of a bill for 447l on J W Coke Esq Walsingham and various attempts at making an acceptance and the signature of J W Joke MR WILSON I have seen a great deal of Mr Coke s writing he writes the first letter of his name rather carelessly - it is something in the shape of a C I cannot say it never resembles any other letter MISS BLOOM I have been at Walsingham very frequently it is a village - there is no Coke Esq there but Mr Thomas William Coke The prisoner handed in a paper simply declaring his innocence in addition to this he made the following Defence Gentleman I was perfectly aware I should be taken into custody at the banking-house because I was aware that Mr Hanbury was there is it probable if I intended to commit a fraud I should have suffered more than two hours to elapse between the time of my going to Mr Hanbury s or that I should return to the brewery two hours after and inquire of Mr Hanburys servant at what time he would be at the bank they said his usual hour was about two o clock I told them to tell Mr Hanbury I would meet him there - I went and waited outside till Mr Hanbury went in and we both went in at the same time I was labouring at the time under an abberation of mind certainly I was not in a sane state at the time is it likely I should have made two people acquainted with the bill under circumstances which would lead to immediate detection if I had even got the proceeds of the bill I stated to Woodcock that I was going to Mr Hanbury s next morning which he must recollect the reason I went to Mr Hanbury was it was said the bill was sent in a letter saying the owner would call in the course of the day but I did not call as I thought very probably if I went they might have offered me the cash but that was not my object I went in the morning and informed Mr Hanbury of it he said he was going into the City and would call now if I had intended to get the money should I not immediately have gone to the banker s instead of waiting till I had been taken into custody is it feasable that a man in his senses would have done that MR BEVAN The prisoner must have been in the bank before Mr Hanbury came in for I had the letter in my hand when he came into the room MR HANBURY I understand he went and asked what time I generally went into the City I do not recollect them telling me the prisoner would meet me there I generally go into the City about one o clock but went earlier than usual suspecting something GUILTY of uttering -

looking at them these are the notes I received the letter about half-past one o clock at noon and marked the notes in the evening - I have written my own name at the back of them in consequence of the receipt of these notes I went to the bankers in about ten minutes after receiving them from the postman and I ascertained that they were forged - I went to Mr Aberdein a solicitor in Honiton within a quarter of an hour after receiving the letter I went to him in consequence of seeing a letter in the postman s hands directed to Miss Cox who is a lace manufacturer and I knew Mr Aberdein was a friend of hers - she herself was at Brighton at the time I had noticed that the letter was a very similar one to mine- I found the postman in the street and got him to deliver Miss Cox s letter to Mr Aberdein who opened it in my presence looking at it No 3 I have every reason to believe this is it - it was a letter bearing that appearance I did not take it in my hands - it enclosed eight 5l and one 10l Bank notes I made no mark on those notes - Mr Aberdein and I transmitted the notes in separate letters to Messrs Freshfield s the Bank solicitors I made up a letter the same morning and sent it by post as desired in the letter I had received purporting to be the invoice addressed to W Jackson 84 Bishopsgate-street within and Mr Aberdein sent another letter which was written by Mrs Clarke my wife - that was also addressed to Mr Jackson it was in answer to Miss Cox s letter and contained an invoice - both these letters were sent on Sunday the 17th I made up a parcel on the Monday morning containing a small portion of lace to no great amount - it was made up in brown paper the rest of it was blank paper it was directed to Wm Jackson No 84 Bishopsgate-street within - I sent it on Monday morning by the mail which leaves Honiton about half-past one o clock Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q You received the notes on Saturday but did not mark them till Sunday A I marked them on Saturday four or five hours after I received them they had not been out of my hands except being in the banker s hands to ascertain if they were forged and then they were in my presence Miss Cox s notes were not at all mixed with mine ROBERT HENRY ABERDEIN I am an attorney and live at Honiton On Saturday the 16th of March I saw Mr Clarke a letter was delivered to me by the postman addressed to Miss Cox - this is the letter it contained eight 5l and one 10l Bank notes - I put my initials on them immediately these are them - I sent the note and the letter to the solicitor of the Bank of England and requested Mrs Clarke to make out an invoice of goods and send it by post directed to Mr Jackson and on Monday I sent a parcel by the coach directed to Mr W Jackson No 84 Bishopsgate-street RICHARD PEARCE I am the son of Mr Pearce who keeps the Four Swans Bishopsgate-street I know both the prisoners I saw Smith on Saturday the 16th of March in the afternoon - I did not know him before he came to the Four Swans and handed me a small piece of paper - this is it looking at it he said he expected a parcel from the west of England directed according to that paper - as he had by mistake put 84 Bishopsgate-street instead of the number of the Bull Inn as it was going from thence to Norwich - he asked me if I would take it in for him I asked if there would be any thing to pay for it - he said No as all his parcels from the country came paid I then said there would most likely be the porterage and if I paid any thing would he refund it - he said certainly and I agreed to take it in he said he would call in on Monday - on Monday two letters came directed Mr W Jackson 84 Bishopsgate-street London I placed them on the shelf in the bar - I saw Coster on Tuesday between one and two o clock at the bar of our wine-vaults he had a glass of porter and a biscuit he asked what time the Ipswich coach came in and said he expected a gentleman by it who he named - I do not recollect the name I told him the Ipswich coach did not come in till the evening there was a letter laying on the shelf of the bar directed to a Mr Farmer a foreigner - it was put up in the bar to be seen this is the letter looking at it he said he knew Mr Farmer - that he was a Polish gentleman and had taken in a person of the name of Jackson he went on talking of other matters but being at dinner at the time I paid no attention to it - he did not say any thing about a parcel at that time he remained there a short time and then went out - Smith came in about ten minutes after Coster went out he nodded to me and asked if there were any parcels for him - I asked him what name - he said Jackson I then said there were and that they were in the coach-office as the bar-maid had sent them there by mistake during my absence I then sent for my father - I saw Smith go out of the door into the street I did not see him go into the coach-office but saw him afterwards return from the coach-office down the yard - it was about five minutes after he had gone out he then had a parcel under his arm to the best of my recollection I then went to the door and saw him going towards the left in the street towards Bishopsgate church - he walked rather brisk I saw Roe the officer following him and saw him taken Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q This was near two o clock A It was between one and two o clock when Coster came - I cannot say whether it was nearer two than one it might be a little later for what I know - there are two Ipswich coaches they come in about five andhalf-past six o clock in the afternoon - several other coaches call at our house but none of them would bring a person from Ipswich it is only the half-past six o clock coach that calls at our house the other calls occasionally - I did not tell him at what hour the coach came Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Were you alone in the coach-office when Smith came on the 16th A Yes I was in the bar - the paper he handed to me was already written I knew no William Jackson Q Did not he say the gentleman had made a mistake in directing the parcel to your house A No he said he himself had made a mistake he did not mention any gentleman - I thought it was for himself he said nothing about being sent by another MR SCARLETT Q Did you know his name A No I understood him to be Jackson from what passed between us and when he inquired for the parcels I asked him what name - he said Jackson I remained at dinner till I saw him coming from the booking-office The paper was here read as follows - William Jackson No 84 Bishopsgate-street London and on the back Mr T Clarke - Mrs S Cox Houiton Devon REBECCA STONE I am bar-maid to Mr Pearce at the Four Swans On Tuesday morning the 19th of March between nine and ten o clock I was in the bar when one parcel came directed to William Jackson No 84 Bishopsgate-street - I gave it to Mr Pearce between ten and eleven o clock the prisoner Coster came in and asked for a glass of ale I had seen him before but did not know his name - he said he expected a person by the Ipswich coach or he might come by the Bury coach I told him we had no Ipswich coach until the evening and the Bury did not call at our house there was a letter in our bar addressed to Mr Farmer - it had been there nearly a week he saw the letter and asked me if I knew Mr Farmer - I said I did by sight he said he had had money from him and that he had taken a friend of his in of the name of Jackson for nearly 200l - he said if Farmer called again I might say a person had been there who knew him and knew of his pawning a watch in St Maryaxe - but he ought not to have named it as he was a brother Mason this was the second time that he came - he staid about a quarter of an hour the first time and went out into the street and I saw him standing against a post opposite the door - he could see into the bar from that post but not into the yard he came back in about a quarter of an hour and staid nearly an hour - it was during that time that he had the conversation about Farmer and Jackson he was standing against the bar at that time he said he had been in the habit of using the Black Lion but in future he should use our house - he had a glass of ale the second time that he came he said Jackson kept a tavern at the west end of the town - I left the bar and saw no more of him Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q If the Bury coach did not stop at your house it would be necessary for a person to stop outside to stop it A Yes he went out once - he spoke of Jackson as living at the west end of the town not in Bishopsgate-street I have seen Coster bring letters to the postman at our bar and he has drank sometimes at the bar - the bar is in front of the street - the coach office is up the yard he could see partly up the yard when he stood in the street but not into the office SIR J SCARLETT Q Does the Bury coach pass your door A Yes - I do not know at what hour but believe in the afternoon JOHN CLIFFORD I am book-keeper at the Four Swans Bishopsgate-street On Tuesday morning the 19th of March Mr Pearce brought these two letters to me and these two parcels and directed me to take charge of them till they were called for he gave me the letters about seven o clock in the morning and the parcels came about nine or ten - the prisoner Smith called about two o clock and inquired if there was any parcel directed to Mr W Jackson I asked him what part of the country he expected them from - he said from Honiton in Devonshire I told him I had two or three parcels for him and gave him the two parcels and two letters - I told him there was 7s 4d to pay for them he put down 8s - I said he had given me 6d too much I returned him the 6d and 2d - there were three or four sixpences among the 8s he seemed rather confused and told the money over two or three times - he then took the parcels and letters and walked out of the office he was pursued by Mealey the officer who had been waiting in the office ever since eight o clock that morning and could not be seen by any body Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Did Smith appear in rather a bad state of health at the time A Yes I thought he was agitated he walked out rather quick at the rate of four miles an hour - I am certain he did not say Mr Jackson had sent him for the parcels HENRY PEARCE I keep the Four Swans Nos 83 and 84 Bishopsgate-street These two letters were received there - I did not see them myself till the Monday evening I had a communication that day with Mr Cope in consequence of which Roe was placed on Tuesday morning in a room over my gateway and Mealey in the coach-office - Roe could see the coach-office door and into the street from the room he was in I placed Mealey in the coach-office about half-past seven o clock - in the course of the day two parcels arrived one by the Exeter mail and the other by the Devonport the Exeter one came first - I took that in myself Stone took the other in and gave it to me - I took them each up stairs to Roe then took them into the coach-office and gave them to the book-keeper telling him when the person came for them to ask him where the parcels came from I was about the tavern in my business during the day - my son sent for me when Smith came as I had desired him and I went directly to the coach-office expecting to find Jackson inquiring for his parcels I did not find him and I went to my son in the front bar and learned that he had been there - I went into the street and then up the gateway into the coach office - he had not been there I went back to my son again I went into the street again and saw Coster on the opposite side of the street looking up the gateway - I had never seen him before to my knowledge I went a little way down the street and kept sight of him - I saw my brother-in-law on the opposite side of the street and crossed over to speak to him I stood talking to him still keeping Coster in my eye and Coster walked past me towards Bishopsgate church and after getting by me I saw him stoop to look under a hackney-coach - he was on the same side as me he appeared to be looking at something on the opposite side of the street and he looked under the next coach - I saw himturn round rather suddenly after looking the second time under the coach and run I then turned round and saw Mealey the officer coming across the street - Coster ran past me I pursued and overtook him - I turned round and saw Roe coming with Smith and the two parcels I gave Coster to Mealey and went in a hackney-coach with them to the Mansion-house - when I stopped Coster he appeared to be in a hurry and said he was going to the booking-office he did not say what booking-office - when they were in the coach they did not appear to know each other at all they appeared to be very strange Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q A great many coaches go from Bishopsgate-street A Yes Coster was standing still when I saw him I did not see him leaning against a post - he was not walking up and down till he passed me I saw him standing still for two or three minutes - he then walked by me and looked under two coaches the prisoners did not speak to each other in the coach - and by that I say they appeared strange JOHN ROE I am a constable of the City I was at the Four Swans Bishopsgate-street about half-past six o clock in the morning of the 19th of March I was placed in a room over the gateway and could see the door of the booking-office - I saw Smith come there about two o clock in the day I saw him go into the booking-office and come out with two brown paper parcels under his arm - I immediately ran down stairs went out at the front door and observed Smith going in a direction from Bishopsgate church I immediately followed him at a little distance and observed Coster on the other side of the way abreast of Smith - I saw Coster turn his head round look towards me and then towards Smith I then observed Smith looking over his right shoulder with his right eye - I immediately ran forwards and caught hold of Smith and at that moment Coster turned round and ran away he being on the other side of the street I immediately called to Mealey to run and catch him - he did not appear to understand me and I called out Stop thief Mr Pearce brought Coster to me I knew him before - I cannot say that I knew Smith s person I put them into a coach and conveyed them to the Mansion-house - Smith gave me the two letter out of his pocket they had no conversation together in the coach - nothing passed to lead us to suppose they were acquainted Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q You were not many minutes going to the Mansion-house A No - they were on different sides of the street my eye was on one and then on another - my attention was directed to them both the street was not particularly crowded them I knew Coster very well and know he knew me - I have been an officer seven years he has nodded to me and I have been at a house where he has been - there were no coaches except those on the stand to the best of my knowledge - no coach passed it was not a minute and a half from the time I came out till I took Smith - I was at the end of the coach-stand when I saw Coster I saw no coach with four horses pass Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q You were stationed over the gateway A Yes - it took me a little time to come down stairs Smith had just turned the gatepost when I got out - I was about ten yards from him I did not ask him for the letters - he gave them to me at once he said Oh take them DANIEL MEALEY I am one of the City Police - I was appointed nine months ago I was at the Four Swans on Tuesday morning the 19th of March in plain clothes I was in the booking-office behind a partition I could not be seen at the counter - I heard Smith come and ask if they had not a parcel left there in the name of Jackson - I looked round and saw him go out with the parcels I followed him about twenty yards - he was afterwards taken by Roe who pointed on the other side of the way I looked over and saw nobody in particular running as there was a coach-stand - I saw Coster with Mr Pearce I ran and took him from Pearce he was put into a coach Letters read No 1 SIR - I am informed by an old smuggler of lace into Belgium that he has heard you will use me well I shall therefore rely on your honour panctuality and secresy and request you will on receipt of this not fail to select me out of all the different sorts of lace you make an assortment to the amount of 50l worth nett merely by way of specimen of what you can and will do for me -

please send me the invoice per post I am Sir your s obedient WILLIAM JACKSON March 15 1833 No 84 Bishopsgate-street within London Immediate and of importance Mr T Clarke Lace Manufacturer Honiton Devonshire No 3 was dated March 15 1833 addreased to Mrs S Cox Lace Manufacturer Honiton Devonshire and exactly the same as the letter No 2 THOMAS WALKER I am a jeweller I know both the prisoners - I first knew them in 1819 Smith was in the Fleet prison at that time and about a month afterwards he came out of the Fleet and I saw him in Coster s place in Staining-lane and at Bridgewater-square also Coster was then carrying on business in the name of Coates and Co - Smith used to be there writing letters for him I knew them until the beginning of 1820 I became acquainted withthe hand-writing of both of them - this letter No 4 is in the hand-writing of Smith they called themselves factors - I do not know whether Smith was a partner Coster s private house was in Bridgewater-square - I have seen Smith there also as well as at the counting-house looking at another letter No 6 this is Smith s hand-writing it is my belief I have not the least doubt of it looking at the three letters Nos 1 2 and 3 these are in a hand-writing which I have seen Coster write many times when he has not signed his own name to them I have not a doubt of their being his hand-writing - looking at a letter to Mrs Cox No 5 that is Coster s hand-writing in which he used to write Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Where is your jeweller s shop A In Ray-street Clerkenwell I am a working jeweller and do not keep an open shop - I work for myself and sometimes as a journeyman JOSEPH WALKER I am the brother of the last witness - we were in partnership together once and became acquainted with Coster we did business with him - our transactions lasted about a month I did not see him afterwards till very lately - I know Smith and I have seen Coster pay Smith wages for his service in his counting-house I have very little recollection of Smith s handwriting - I know Coster s writing perfectly well looking at the letters Nos 1 2 3 and 5 these are decidedly in his hand-writing I am certain of them - I am sure they are all four his writing his burried hand-writing is very different when he is putting his thoughts together to be copied but that is the calm and collected hand he writes after he is copying it out of a book in which he writes - I have seen him write letters which he has not put his own name to he unfortunately forged my name Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q You saw him in 1820 A I believe it was in 1819 - I had nothing to do with him afterwards I spoke to him about six months ago JOHN LUSH I have known Coster eleven years and Smith about a year and a half - Coster s last counting-house was in New-street Bishopsgate-street he carried on business there in the name of William Young and Co - he has done that since January this year I knew him before that carrying on business in Great St Helens under the firm of Thomas Gibbons and Co he carried on business in that name from October 1831 until about a month or six weeks before January - I believe he then took a counting-house in Windsor-street and then went to New-street I have been employed by him to copy letters for him - I commenced in October 1831 - I wrote a great many letters for him and during the whole time I was in the habit of seeing Smith in St Helen s acting as his clerk I became acquainted with the hand-writing of both of them - these two letters are written by Smith to the best of my opinion - these four I believe on looking over them to be written by Coster they are not in his usual hand-writing but I have seen such writing as this of his when he has been particular and had them written so as to be fully understood - but his general hand-writing is in a great hurry and not so legible I believe them to be his hand-writing Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Are they not written in a current running hand A Yes not a forced hand I have not seen him write that hand very often - I think I have seen him write like this but should be very sorry to swear positively I have received written directions from him which he has acknowledged - they were lists of names and addresses I have written into the country for him and those lists were returned to him Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Are you sure these letters are in Smith s writing A I believe them to be his - I know one Lewis there is a similarity to Lewis hand-writing but I do not believe it to be Lewis writing Q Look at this paper whose writing do you believe it to be A I am not aware that I have seen this writing I have seen Smith write like this but it is impossible to say when persons are in the habit of varying their writing - I have done nothing for this year and a half but writing letters for Coster I never became bail for any body SIR J SCARLETT Q Have you been pretty much employed writing letters for Coster since 1831 A Yes I have written twelve letters a day and twenty-four or thirty according to the number he wanted he appeared to carry on a great deal of business Lewis was a clerk of Coster s - I have known him as long as Coster for eleven years MASON STEVENSON I am an attorney I have seen several letters from Coster and have seen him write looking at four letters these bear strong characters of his hand-writing but the writing I have generally seen is more of a running hand but still there are the strong characteristics of the hand that I have not the least doubt of their being Coster s Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q How long is it since you saw him write A I think about eighteen months I saw him write six times but I have perhaps seen fifty or one hundred letters from him addressed to my late partner Mr Gates - we dissolved partnership about eighteen months ago I have seen no letters from him since The following letters were here read No 4 SIR - I want at first hand Honiton or fine Devonshire lace of all sorts for smuggling into Belgium - quantity will not be of any object to me so as the prices suit I will not deal through any agent or agents in London nor have to do with a third person in this affair nor in fact do any business personally only by letter as I am a partner in one of the first and oldest houses in London and dare not privately trade if it is known - I am conscious of doing my partners no harm because they are not in the lace trade - nor do I want to use the firm s name but my own for the benefit of my family I want no credit nor do I give any - I rely on your honour and punctuality as well as secrecy and beg to say that I can at this time buy from 1000l to 5000l worth of lace and remit you the money by post in Bank of England notes before hand to do away all manner of doubt It will be therefore necessary for you to furnish me per post paid letter patterns and prices of all you have for sale as this lace is wanted in a hurry - I beg to know if you receive the money whether you will per return of coach send on the lace directed to my order observe in as portable a parcel as possible which will not be unpacked here until after it is smuggled into its place by the foreign conrier - your answer in course of post postage paid will oblige - Sir yours respectfully February 11 1833 JOHN HOARE Horse and Groom Inn Blackfriar s-road London No 5 was precisely to the same effect as the letter No 1 but addressed to Mrs Cox Honiton No 6 was also addressed to Mrs Cox and in the same words as the letter No 4 JOSHUA FREEMAN I am inspector of Bank notes to the Bank Looking at the ten 5l notes these are all forged in every particular paper plate and signature and all from the same plate looking at those sent to Miss Cox these eight 5l notes are all from the same plate and are all forged Coster s Defence Were it not that my case has been prejudged and that I had been libelled vilified and slandered indeed already condemned by the public newspapers and that in a manner little becoming the situation they hold in society I should await your verdict with the most perfect tranquillity under a conviction that my innocence fully entitles me to an acquittal but a penny pamphlet has been sold in the street professing to contain an account of our committal as two noted swindlers for forgery this has been carried about London and the newspapers have thought proper to make statements about me but when I see so respectable a Jury I am satisfied I shall have a fair English trial and I think I shall be able to convince you of my innocence - that I never wrote one of the letters or caused one to be written I have done business with a gentleman in your box some years back to some considerable amount - I respectfully submit the case before you as a mere abstract question whether the letters given in evidence were written by me - and I trust the respectable evidence I shall produce will place that question beyond the possibility of a doubt I have been a general dealer in sundry articles for twenty years - I have paid hundreds of ready money to most respectable persons - the prosecutors have rested their case solely on the evidence of the Walker s to prove my writing it is fifteen years since I had any connexion with them and I paid 200l to Joseph Walker for chains which I supposed to be gold but found them to be spurious and could not make a farthing of them - they are the only persons who take upon themselves to swear to my writing I believe all of you must know the difficulty of a man writing two different hands without his hand being discovered without being able to disguise it you are well aware of the power that my prosecutors have and the means they have of bribing people and I know that they have bribed my clerks whom I relied upon for my defence and my papers have been taken away which prevents my showing my bills I declare most solemnly I know nothing of the letters in question the respectable evidence I have to offer in opposition to that of Walker s will at once convince you of my innocence you will recollect how ready and willing the Police-officer was in giving evidence and saying he saw my fellow prisoner looking over his right shoulder with his right eye and every device he could use to prejudice your minds against me there cannot be a more public place than Bishopsgate-street and coaches are going to and fro every moment I assure you I had nothing to apprehend to run for I was not aware of Smith s being taken nor had I been with him I was not aware of his having gone to the Four Swans for any parcel the reason of my running was becasue I saw a friend a few yards before me who was going from the Spread Eagle into the country I might mend my pace to catch him - I said I was going to the booking-office meaning the Spread Eagle Gentlemen you will observe when I went to the bar of the Four Swans in the morning I inquired when the Ipswich not the Honiton coach came in I told him I expected a gentleman from Ipswich to stop there I had a note the day before stating he would be in London and expected him by some country coach that morning all the Norfolk and Suffolk coaches which start from the other side of Ipswich must come through Ipswich and I could not tell what time he would come I was waiting thinking I might see a Norwich coach come in - I saw one put down a passenger at the next inn I went and asked Pearce the son if the Ipswich coach had come in and he said No I understood him that one came in between one and two o clock that was the reason of my going there at that time I declare I never mentioned the name of Jackson - I knew Farmer he had taken a watch from a friend of mine whose name is quite different from Jackson how they connect the name of Jackson with it I cannot tell - it is a similar name but not Jackson young Pearce who has been trained no doubt by the powerful enemy I have says William Jackson why I should name William to one and Mr to the other I must leave it to you to judge If any of you gentlemen belong to the Society of Guardians for the Protection of Trade I trust you will waive all prejudice from your minds as to having seen my name in their list for some years past all I crave from you is justice without prejudice I am informed that Lush has had a large sum for swearing to my writing it is true I have paid him a deal of money for copying letters knowing him to be in a starving condition but he does not venture to swear that it is my writing Mr Stevenson has not brought one of my letters forward to compare - that would not suit Mr Freshfield s purpose there is not proof of my having put the notes into the letters there is a chain of circumstantial suspicious evidence when I prove that neither of the letters are my hand-writing I trust an end will be put to the case at once I have been twenty years in credit and can have at this time 1000l on credit if I wanted it and if I could not obtain it I should be merely arrested and kept in prison as a common debtor and is it likely I should pass forged notes to be transported for life Smith never was my clerk in the whole course of his life - he has sold goods for me by commission and I positively deny sending him for the parcel - they do not attempt to prove the paper with the address of William Jackson on it is my writing - I saw that paper before the Lord Mayor - it appears to me the same as the letters if I had been seen walking away in company with Smith who was going after the parcel it is no reason that I should be committing a criminal act I trust you will say it is too much to convict a man of felony because an officer happens to be on him while he is running in the King s highway I deny looking under the hackney coaches and I now rest my case in your hands and look to you as my protectors Smith s Defence I solemnly declare I am totallyignorant of the corrupt cause that has given rise to this prosecution I knew Jackson when I was in the habit of visiting Manchester - he failed there and I have lately renewed my acquaintance with him I met him in Whitechapel - he said I want you to do a little business for me we will go and take a glass of ale - I have written to two correspondents of mine in Devonshire for samples of light goods they will be in two small parcels I intended them to go to the Black Bull but have addressed them to No 84 - have the goodness to call at No 84 in my name and give them this paper when they come I don t expect them before Monday or Tuesday - ask them to take them in I know the party well and expect they will pay the carriage - my reason for not going myself is because I expect there are one or two write out against me I agreed that it should be Tuesday before I saw Jackson again - I went to Bishopsgate-street as the witnesses state I called on Tuesday and having learnt the parcels had come went up the gateway and came out with them as another man would and had not got far down when Roe took me - I gave them up not knowing there was any thing wrong I have now stated nothing but the truth - it was in consequence of Jackson s representation I went I have nothing to do with the correspondence JAMES HARMER ESQ ALD I have been many years carrying on the profession of solicitor to a great extent - I have been concerned both for and against Coster for several years - I have had nothing to do for him for the last five years but before that for perhaps eight or ten years I cannot bring to my recollection any instance of seeing him write but I have had many letters from him and have had communications with him upon them I think I have means of forming a very accurate judgment of his writing - looking at letters I should say these letters are not his they appear to me to be a better hand than his - than the letters I have treated as his I should say this is a common ordinary hand - it does not seem to me to be a feigned hand they are certainly different-to what I have always seen SIR J SCARLETT Q Have you been concerned for and against him in civil or criminal proceedings A Criminal I was first concerned for him about fifteen years ago when he had a prosecution against him - I do not know what his firm was then I was not concerned for him for a long while after that - he has been at my house and perhaps for an hour together but I cannot charge my memory Q He never was in your house for a week A Oh dear no - never for a day the letters I have had from him have not been in so good a hand I should say it was a more illiterate hand I have seen Smith - I think he has been at my house on Coster s business I did not know Lewis the clerk by name - I have no recollection of seeing a letter written by Coster but signed in a different name his letters to me were on professional business some very long I think it is four or five years ago since I was last concersed for him he was then a defendant - I think it was a proceeding about some bills I do not recollect how it was arranged - I think the bills were given up Q Do you think this his hand-writing producing a book A Yes I should say it was - some of the writing in this book is his and I should say some is not I do not know that he carried on any business five years ago - there was a firm but I believe he was out of business - I do not recollect what name the firm was some persons with whom he corresponded have been with me as clients I do not know whether his business was extensive - he was not a client of mine in a general sense persons had bills which he obtained from them - he came to me as a client to give them up I was concerned against him in a prosecution more than once COURT Q Did you say the letters do not appear to you to be written in a constrained hand-writing A They do not - they appear to me a natural hand JOSEPH ROSE I am an auctioneer and live in Church-court Old Jewry I have been acquainted with Coster fourteen or fifteen years - I have very often had opportunities of becoming acquainted with his hand-writing - I have seen him write looking at the four letters I think these are not the hand-writing of Coster SIR J SCARLETT Q Did you ever see them before A Never I have sold a very considerable quantity of woollen goods to him by private contract as well as at auctions - I have dealt very largely in woollen goods I am not a general dealer - if linen or any thing came into my hands I should sell it linen and other goods frequently come into my hands - it is only an accidental circumstance which makes me purchase I have sold goods for Mr Coster - I sold goods last for him in 1831 that was four bucks he brought them to me to get an advance of money on them - I lent him money on them sent them into the market and they were sold by another person I think I never sold goods by auction for him in my life - I am not a friend of his he applied to me - very unfortunately I lent him money before on goods and have lost money by them I lent 3l or 4l on the bucks and I lost money before by him - I knew him by living a few hundred yards from him I live in Church-court Old Jewry - when I first knew him I lived in Maiden-lane he lived near me then I do not know where he removed to his residence was in Staining-lane I never knew him by any other firm but Coster and Co he very frequently bought woollen goods of me he always paid me either in cash or perhaps a draft on his banker - I think he has bought goods of me forty or fifty times sometimes 20l sometimes 10l and sometimes 100l worth I unfortunately advanced him money on property which did not realise it - it was bills of lading for silks - I have frequently seen him write notes and orders I certainly do not believe any part of these letters to be like his hand-writing it does not require to read them to form a judgment of his writing - it is not his hand-writing nor like it in my opinion I do not know Smith - I have been at the counting-house in Staining-lane Coster told me he had bought the bucks I do not recollect where - I think the greater part of this book looking at it is in his writing but here is some which I think is not his writing here are some names and addresses which I think are not his MR BODKIN Q Coster is in your debt A Yes - I have applied for it and cannot get it I never saw these letters before - it is apparent from a slight inspection that they are not Coster s writing JAMES MORRIS PHILLIPS I am a dealer in East India goods I formerly kept a Manchester warehouse and live in Sun-street Bishopsgate I first knew Coster in 1819 and 1820 I have had repeated dealings with him to small amounts - I have had frequent opportunities of seeing himwrite so as to form a judgment of his hand-writing I should say these letters are decidedly not his hand-writing - I will take a more minute look at them I am confirmed in what I stated - they are a considerably better hand - his is a stiff illiterate hand this is the hand of a tolerable good penman - I have not seen these letters before SIR JAMES SCARLETT Q Have you any letters of his hand-writing with you A No I think I have seen him write within these three months he was giving me an account of some goods which he had for sale and was transcribing the particulars and numbers - I have had frequent dealings with him from the year 1829 to 1832 and then there was a cessation my first transaction with him was purchasing goods chiefly British goods linen woollen and cotton I have lately bought hats of him - I never bought hardware - I have sold him within the last eight months the materials with which hats are manufactured and he has paid me for them - I never sold him goods until the last eight months our transactions have been very frequent - I have not been intimate with him except on business I did not visit his house - I dealt with him in the firm of Lyall Phillips & Son I never dealt with him in any other name than Coster - I have taken a great number of bills from him I have discounted bills for him at most of the London bankers that have country connections - he has never discounted for me I began to discount bills for him about six years since - they have always been on London bankers but I have not done any within these last six or eight months - they were always small amounts I do not think any exceeded 80l - I seldom did more than one at a time he used to send them to me in a note and that is the way I became acquainted with his hand-writing - I should think I have discounted 1000l for him altogether from 1000l to 1500l would be the extent - it is not part of my business to discount bills I did it as a matter of favour - I did it running no risk I did not discount bills for any body else - I may have done it or procured them to be done as an accommodation I never discounted any other bills but those drawn by country bankers either on London bankers or the Bank of England - I never held any of his acceptances I never knew the firm of Gibbons and Co - I had no transactions with that firm I have seen the name of Gibbons written on an office which Mr Coster used to transact business at I think it was in Great St Helen s- I do not recollect the Christian name I do not think it was written over the door I think it was under a general list of parties who had offices there - I do not know the firm of Benvolio and Co nor Hamilton and Co - I have known him for many years in Staining-lane the firm there was Richard Coster & Co and then he went I think to Winchester-street - I did not know the firm of Young and Co I knew him in New-street - I do not recollect any name written up there I always received notes from him as Richard Coster - I never saw a note written by him and signed by another signature MR ADOLPHUS Q Have you known very frequently persons of great respectability trading in names not their own A Yes trading in names which have ceased to exist - the firm of Mellish and Co does not exist WILLIAM DODGE FIDLER I live at No 14 New-street and am clerk to a solicitor I have been acquainted with Coster about twenty years - I have seen him write very often and have had opportunities of seeing his handwriting I have seen two letters at Mr Freshfield s about a week ago - I do not see them here I believe these four are not his hand-writing - they are written too fine in too good a hand-writing SIR JAMES SCARLETT Q Who are you clerk to A Mr Garnett of the late firm of Gates and Garnett - Mr Coster was Mr Gates client in money transactions he drew bills and got Coster to get money on them - I do not know who introduced Coster to Gates - I did not the acquaintance commenced when I was a clerk in an agent s office who did business in the Sheriffs Court - Coster used to come there to take out actions and bring clients Coster s connection with Gates was to discount bills not to very large amounts perhaps 300l or 400l my acquaintance with him ceased when I left Gates which was in March 1831 - Gates was a bankrupt then I never knew Coster accept bills for Gates - he used to get bills drawn and send me for the money I do not know what firm Coster dealt in - I have seen the name of Gibbons and Co on his door in Great St Helen s I have seen Smith in the office but had no conversation with him some of this book I think is in Coster s hand-writing - I do not believe the whole of the page on the left hand to be his I think the last entry is not - I believe the rest to be his hand-writing except some parts of the names I do not think this Parker London-dock is his - on the other side I think Joseph Chambers is his I should rather say the entry following is not his I never knew such a person as Gibbons - my business was through Coster MR BODKIN Q Had other people counting-houses at the house in Great St Helen s as well as Coster A Yes it was let out from top to bottom JOHN BAILEY I am a poulterer in Newgate-market I have known Coster about twelve years - I have had frequent opportunities of seeing his hand-writing and I think I can form a judgment of the characters of it I should say his hand is a perfect scrawl that of a man that could not write a good hand looking at the letters - most decidedly these are not his hand-writing there is not a single character like it SIR JAMES SCARLETT Q He dealt in your business A He has sent me dead poultry to sell - not in very large quantities he has sent me 10 or 15 geese and 20 to 30 ducks - I do not remember any fowls and never had any game I do not know where he got them - I saw his hand-writing in a note containing an advice of goods to sell and in adjusting accounts and have his letters requesting to know how the market went and how it was likely to go I have seen him write - he has given me an acknowledgment that he has had his different accounts from day to day I have none of them with me - I have had a letter from him since he has been in prison and have that in my pocket - looking at the book here is one entry of Coster s which takes my eye immediately Captain James Chambers I should think the words J C Chambers are written by the same hand but the pen has been mended before he has written further I believe it to be his and the rest of the entry - I think it is not all his I do not think all the entry on the other side is his - I think Joseph Petre and Horatio are not his there appears to me to be a date supplied in this entry which is not the same hand-writing - I cannot swear it I only think it bears a resemblance but not what I should like to swear to I believe all that side to be his except the bottom entry and Joseph Petre COURT Q You think the entries on both sides are not all his and one on both sides you are doubtful about A Yes MR ADOLPHUS Q This is a book of different entries made at different times and in different manners A It appears so Q The letters are written at one time and in one manner A Yes - I have received more than one hundred letters from him I have not a doubt of a single character in them being his hand-writing - I think that the difference of writing before and after dinner in the book would make the difference but there is not a single letter in the whole four letters a bit like his - I never knew a man disguise his hand-writing by writing a better hand than he ever wrote before - I have never seen these letters before JOSHUA HUDSON I keep a tavern in Leadenhall-market - I was formerly a pugilist I have known Coster eighteen months or two years I have seen him write frequently - I should not judge these letters to be his hand-writing I believe they are not his hand-writing - I think his writing rather worse than that of the two SIR J SCARLETT Q Is it rather worse or much worse A I should call it rather worse I have laid out 200l or 300l with him - I bought some hats of him and sold him some wine I do not import - I bought it myself it remained in the docks perhaps two months before I sold it him - I paid for it before I sold it him that was not my first acquaintance with him - I bought some vinegar of him I made a chap with him for a watch and sold him some crape shawls which I bought of some seamen who used my place - I take in seamen and ship them out I have not offered money to any body to come to be witness for Coster I bought one hundred jars of pickled cabbage of him - he gave me an account of it I do not think it is as long as two years that I have known him - his counting-house was in Great St Helen s a different name was put outside the door saying the counting-house was on the first floor - I think the name of Gibbons was up I used to find him on the first floor - I do not know the firm of William Young and Co MR BODKIN Q You did not know him us Gibbons A No I always knew him as Coster GEORGE TURNER I am clerk to Mr Taylor an attorney of Stanhops-street Strand I have known Smith about ten years I have seen him write repeatedly and can form a judgment of his writing - looking at two letters I am sure these are not the hand-writing of Smith SIR J SCARLETT Q What was the nature of your connection with Smith A I knew him first when he failed in business - he was a commission-agent I know Coster very well but not so long as Smith - a person of the name of Green who is dead introduced me to Coster Smith has since that been an accountant and I have had business with him in making up bankrupts accounts - I do not know that he has been clerk to Coster but he used to be in Coster s counting-house - he used to sell for Coster by commission I understood so from Smith himself - I corresponded with him a great deal on bankrupts business I have employed him and he me to attend under different commissions and to defend actions which have been brought against him - he has had many actions brought against him I have been concerned for Coster too - he has not had many actions I was never employed to negociate with Walker - I was never in the Golden Cross tap Charing-cross in my life - I swear that positively since Coster s imprisonment I have seen Lewis his clerk - I met him in Playhouse-yard Whitecross-street I have never been in a room with him since his master s imprisonment I saw him at the Mansion-house at the examination - I do not see him here I should think I have known Lewis about two years - he was clerk to Coster Coster had another clerk - his name was Nicholson he had been clerk to Coster about six months - I have seen him writing in the counting-house six months before Coster s imprisonment I know the Seven Stars Carey-street - I have not been there within the last two years I have not been there with Lewis since Coster s imprisonment Smith was a friend of mine - I have lent him money he owes me money now - a few pounds I cannot exactly tell you how many exactly Mr BARRY Q As you had business with Smith was it necessary you should call on him at times A Yes and that took me to Coster s JOHN CROCKFORD I am an egg-dealer I sell for myself - I have no shop I live at No 8 Poole-terrace City-road I have known Smith about two years I was with him on the 16th of March in Whitechapel-road - I saw a person who called himself William Jackson I joined that person and the prisoner about twelve o clock - we walked down as far as Whitechapel-church and went into a public-house opposite I think it was the Two Bells and drank out of a pint of porter or half-and-half - after that Jackson wrote a slip of paper for Smith to go for a parcel he was to call at Bishopsgate-street and leave the paper - he said the parcel was expected from the country somewhere Jackson said he could not go for them as there was a writ or two out against him - I saw some money pass from Jackson to Smith I cannot be sure but I think he said from 7s to 8s - Smith undertook to go COURT Q Who gave the 7s or 8s A Jackson gave it to Smith he left Jackson just by the church by Whitechapel-church MR BARRY Q Did Jackson say any thing before he went A He wished to see him again in the course of a day or two I have seen Jackson call at Smith s No 15 Craven-street Charles-square - I have been there when a person called about a fortnight ago and left his name as William Jackson I left Smith on this occasion at the corner of Houndsditch - I did not proceed with him to Bishopsgate-street SIR JAMES SCARLETT Q Is Smith married to your mother A No my mother is housekeeper there she has lived there about two years - I am twenty-two years old I am not married - my sister keeps my house for me I hawk eggs about to shops and families - I have only seen Jackson twice before I met him with Smith I saw him at Smith s house - he called to see Smith while Iwas there to see my mother it was a fortnight before this happened - I have frequently heard Smith talk about him and I know he left his name with my mother as William Jackson - but when I was with Smith in Whitechapel-road he met us they had a conversation about the parcel - I walked behind at first till they got to the public-house and then I went in as they went in I was going to see a friend at the Pavilion and met Smith in Houndsditch and we walked down Whitechapel-road together - I did not go to see my friend but I came back with Smith to the Two Bells I had no particular reason for seeing my friend we stopped at the Two Bells for a quarter of an hour and had a pint of half-and-half - I think the landlord was present I believe he was - it was a man who served us Jackson asked Smith if he would have any objection to fetch a parcel for him and Smith said No if it would do him any good he would - Jackson wrote a slip of paper to leave it there for him and gave him the money to pay what expence there might be he said he would place that in his hands to pay for the parcel - he said it was 7s or 8s I cannot exactly say how much it was - I left Smith at the corner of Houndsditch I did not go to my friends - I have seen Smith write I cannot tell his hand-writing - I have heard of Coster I do not know him I have not seen Jackson since - I was at the Mansion-house when the prisoners were brought up but not on the first day - I came to see Smith the day after he was brought there I was there on the Wednesday - I was not there on the Tuesday I am positive of that - I did not offer myself as a witness I went merely to see Mr Smith to know what had become of him - my mother did not know where he was being out all night COURT Q Did you tell the gentlemen at the Mansion-house this story A No I was not asked about it COSTER -

I presented the note at the Bank it turned out to be forged I met him on the Tuesday evening in Long-lane Smithfield - he was coming towards me he looked a little wild as he passed me as if he was startled - I turned round and looked at him he turned and looked towards me and seeing me standing he took to his heels and ran - I ran after him and caught him in Bartholomew-close I am certain he is the man he caught hold of me by the hand and said he would pay me -

he said so before the Lord Mayor I had a load of 18lbs of tea on my back - I lost sight of him after he ran away first but not after I took him WILLIAM FOX I live at No 6 Rotten-row Goswell-street On the 19th of March I heard Mr Eward call out and saw the prisoner running at great speed in the road - Mr Eward tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I had seen a man in top boots go along - I ran and overtook the prisoner and when Eward came up he put out his hand to shake hands with him and said For God s sake don t discover me for I am undone - you shall have your money I walked behind him and at the corner of Fan-street he got away - I pursued and caught him in Brackley-street he then said to me There are others against me - this is not the only one - they can only transport me in Golden-lane he told some men it was about a bastard child and then the men rescued him and he was taken by Hill Cross-examined Q Did you hear him say that A Yes and so did Hill - I lost sight of him in the first instance but not the second he did not say he wanted to produce the man who gave him the note JOHN HILL I am a constable I was in Golden-lane I saw the prisoner running and people after him crying Stop thief I stopped him -

I know him by his features JOHN CUMMINS I keep a public-house in St James On Sunday evening the 3rd of February I believe the prisoner to be the man who came to the bar door and asked if we sold wine - it was 3s 6d a bottle he said he did not care what the price was so that it was good when he tendered the 10l note I said Where is it going to he said No 25 Little James-street I said There is no such number in the street you must mean No 25 Great James-street Mr Holmes he said That is the very name I wrote on the note Mr Holmes this is the note -

the street door was open - I and Creber went in the ground-floor front-room door being fast - I immediately burst it open and the two prisoners were laying on the bed it was about half after two o clock in the day time - the female prisoner was dressed and the male prisoner partly undressed they immediately jumped up and the female prisoner said Oh my God - Chamberlaine said It is all right Fogg I have been working a square game - I secured Chamberlaine and Creber secured Hill - I searched Chamberlaine and found nothing on him - I went to the left-hand cupboard by the fireplace and underneath a pan of water I found some pieces of metal a file with white metal in the teeth of it a tobacco-pipe with some white metal in the bowl of it - I then searched the cupboard on the other side of the fire-place and found undernerneath the floor in the cupboard concealed among some dirt a mould the floor was decayed - I found the mould wrapped in a piece of white paper - I immediately gave it to Mr Mitchell the cupboards had no doors to them Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Did Creber go into the room with you at first A He did I observed none of these things in any part of the room except the cupboards - they could not be seen by a person going in casually they were concealed COURT Q Did you know the prisoners A Yes I have had them in custody before for the same offence and I believe they lived together in the room - I have no reason to suppose them married they go by different names I have seen them going in and out there JAMES FOGG I am a Thames police-surveyor I accompanied the other officers to the prisoners lodging - I entered the room immediately after them - I cut the bed-tick open seeing a hole in the middle of it - I cut it larger and turned the whole contents of the bed out and found a bag with forty-three counterfeit shillings in it - I gave them to Mr Mitchell and I found six counterfeit half crowns in a piece of white paper in the tick - Chamberlaine said to Hill This will lag us Sal that means transport she made no remark to that - he said he had been there two months and that he did not take the room Cross-examined Q You went in after the other officers A Yes rather ALEXANDER MITCHELL I am inspector of the police - I accompanied James Fogg to the house Thomas Fogg and Creber got there before us we followed them in directly - I entered the room on the ground-floor and then both the prisoners were standing up off the bed - I saw them secured there was a conversation as to whom the room belonged to - Hill said she hired the room and paid for it- I found in the cupboard on the right-hand side two bags of plaister of Paris and I saw Fogg find the mould - he handed it up to me I produce it - James Fogg handed the couterfeit coin to me from the bed I produce that - I believe this to be the same - but after the former trial I mixed some other counterfeit coin with them but I believe these to be the same - I know what I found were counterfeit - there were two bands in the bag of plaister of Paris they were pieces of old hats - I have destroyed them Cross-examined Q You say you had ascertained the coin to be counterfeit was that from Mr Field s evidence A No from my own knowledge - it is so soft a metal it is different from silver or any other coin COURT Q Did the man say anything about the room A Yes he said he only came there occasionally to see Hill HENRY HACKER The house No 1 Devonshire-court belongs to me and was let to the two prisoners by my wife - the rent has been paid to me several times by Hill - I only know who took it from what my wife has told me - I have seen the male prisoner there several times - I have seen both of them there - my house is right opposite and I believed them to be living there as man and wife - I have seen them going backwards and forward repeatedly - my wife is confined to her bed - there are five rooms in the house they only occupied one the rent was paid every evening - it was 6 1/2d a-day- the room was taken by the week Cross-examined Q The male prisoner never paid you any rent A Never I have seen them go in and out both separately and together - I saw one as much as the other JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to the mint - I have been in the habit of seeing counterfeit coin for many years - this is a plaister of Paris mould - having on one half of it the observe side of a shilling impressed and on the other the reverse side - this mould would stamp the impression of a shilling in all respects and it appears to have been used for that purpose I have a shilling in my hand which I believe to have been cast in this mould it corresponds in all respects with it - here is a piece of metal which is called a get which appears to have been made in this mould it fits the channel all the shillings produced are counterfeit several of them have not been cast in the mould - here are only two which I can be positive have been cast in this mould - the half-crowns are all counterfeit they are all the same kind of metal - the metal can be easily fused in a tobacco pipe and poured into the mould - a small band of hat might be used to confine the plaister JAMES FOGG re-examined Q You spoke of finding a mould in one cupboard and one in another A No I only found it in the right hand cupboard - the mould in the white paper is the same mould as I mentioned before Chamberlaine s Defence One thing I have to say that is the landlord is wrong to what he said the first time - he said at first he had seen me frequently there but could not say that I lived there HENRY HACKER re-examined I said they lived there as man and wife Chamberlaine Very probably the things found there were left by characters who lived in the room before me which I could bring witnesses to prove I did not live with Ann Hill - I only came now and then to her - I happened to come on Friday I was playing at skittles in Brick-lane I got intoxicated I went to her and remained there till about eight o clock at night then went to a wine-house and returned home about one o clock in the morning I went to her and was there until I was taken - Fogg said the door was fast it was only on the latch - it was not fastened - the lock hung by one nail - the door was falling to pieces - the pannels were not thicker than half a crown THOMAS FOGG re-examined The door was fast I tried it and burst it open - I don t think there was any lock to it - I think it was bolted - I did not look at it when I got in I put my shoulder against it and knocked it all to pieces - I saw that there was a latch to it and that was fast I will not swear there was a bolt Hill s Defence We had not lived together not for eight months HENRY HACKER re-examined I let the room to them furnished -

I took the prisoner to Guildhall I locked the house and kept the key I gave it to Mr Compton the landlord - I returned to the house in two or three hours before I parted with the key I searched the privy and found part of a mould of a crown-piece Mr Compton was present it was down in the soil I found this dark lantern in the same place GEORGE CRAWLEY policeman I took Smith on Snowhill on a charge of passing bad money I went with the witness to take the prisoner - Smith has been convicted of passing counterfeit money I was with Waller at the first search I have nothing to add to his evidence - I confirm it I saw everything found I was not present when the privy was searched SARAH HILLIER I live in Barley Mow-passage next door to the house the prisoner occupied I had seen him at nine o clock on the morning he was apprehended in the house - I have seen him go backwards and forwards - I have seen him go in at eleven o clock at night JAMES COMPTON The house in Barley-mow-passage belongs to me as an executor the prisoner took the house on the 6th of January last at a rental of £25 a-year - I was present at the second search Walker s evidence is correct JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint - I have a great deal of experience in examining counterfeit coin and other things this mould is of plaster of Paris on one half of it is impressed the obverse side of half-a-crown - the other half has the impression of the reverse side the mould has been used for casting coin - it is discoloured from the heated metal having been poured in - I find among the metal produced what is called a get which fits the mouth of the mould and appears to have been cast in it COURT Q Suppose I was pouring metal into the mould when filled there would be a stream which would be afterwards cut off A Yes the three half-crowns produced are all counterfeit they are cast in white metal and correspond in all respects with the mould - the spoons are of a similar metal to the counterfeit coin and are frequently bought for that purpose this iron ladle has white metal in it - the tobacco pipe is used to pour it into - here is a portion of grain tin this plaster of Paris is what the mould is made with - the files are frequently used to remove the lumps on the surface of the coin and to cut off the get there is white metal in the teeth of the file - the tin band is used to form the mould Prisoner s Defence written My wife who has had the misfortune to break her leg has been for some time confined in the hospital and during that period a young man named Brown with whom I was acquainted lodged with me He had free and unobserved egress and ingress and during my absence at my daily work had of course abundaut opportunities to take any articles either in or out of the house had he been so inclined I have discovered that he is well known to Smith the witness against me and I have a firm persuasion that the articles found at my lodging and now produced against me were placed there for concealment by Brown The very manner of their concealment justifies this suspicion they were found behind some drawers which he well knew I never had occasion to move and where they were in no way likely to meet my observation At the time of my being taken into custody I was proceeding to my work having just visited my wife in the hospital Nothing whatever was found upon me of an improper nature and I willingly offered to accompany the officers to my lodging feeling certain that nothing wrong could be found there Permit me to ask if it is probable I should so have acted had I been aware of these articles being there concealed That such would never have been the act of a guilty man I do most respectfully yet confidently submit Previous to this unhappy charge my character was never called in question while the witness Smith has long been known to the police has been several times in custody and yet upon his sole information I am placed in a most dangerous and threatening situation GUILTY Aged 32 -

t18340410-103  626 WILLIAM HARRIS was indicted for that he having in his custody and possession a Bill of Exchange for the payment of 30l setting it forth at three months after date drawn by William Harris upon William Dobson Albany-street Camberwell afterwards on the same day feloniously did forge thereon an acceptance thereof with intent to defraud William Dobson 2nd COUNT For feloniously uttering the like forged acceptance with like intent Two other Counts stating his intent to defraud Robert Disher Four other Counts omitting to set out the forged instrument MR ADOLPHUS conducted the Prosecution WALTER CHARLES VENNING I am an attorney I had to recover a sum of money on a Bill of Exchange on the prisoner and one Gee - I sued Gee upon it for Robert Disher of Edinburgh - the prisoner called on me in consequence and proposed to me to take his own warrant of attorney and the acceptance of a Mr William Dobson for the amount as security for the demand - he stated that Dobson lived at No 18 Albany-road Camberwell and to be in the service of his Majesty s Excise and also to be his own brother-in-law - he referred me to a Mr Carpenter Smith a solicitor in the Borough and to Mr Scully a soap-manufacturer at Bermondsey as to the stability of Dobson - the Bill of Exchange was to be given for 30l - he stated Dobson to be in the receipt of about 140l a-year - after four or five days during which I had made inquiry he called on me again - I drew this bill addressing it to William Dobson producing it and handed it him to procure the acceptance of Dobson - he came to me about four days afterwards and handed me the bill in its present state apparently accepted by William Dobson - he said nothing more about Dobson - other persons were with him and the person who was negotiating the business for him came with him to execute the warrant and handed over the bill - a warrant of attorney was executed and the bill delivered by the prisoner and he endorsed it - upon that proceedings in the action were stayed - the bill became due on the 12th of February - it had been handed to my client - it is now in my hand unpaid - two sums of 6l each have been paid on account of the warrant of attorney Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How much is there unpaid A 18l the sums were paid to me - I do not know whether I gave any receipt for them - we commonly write the amount off on the instrument - I always give a receipt when requested - the warrant was filed in the proper office - I do not know whether I wrote the sums off on the warrant - I presume I did - I may be wrong - I did not know it was material and am not able to say - I recollect that 12l was paid COURT Q You have stated that he paid two sums of 6l how is it that you recollect that as you do not recollect giving any receipt A I know those two sums were paid to me at my office MR PHILLIPS Q Was anybody present A I do not know - these sums are entered in my book - I have not my books here - I am constantly referring to them - I have not looked at them to satisfy myself about these two sums- the first sum was paid the latter end of November or beginning of December - the second I think two or three weeks afterwards Q Are you not in the habit of giving vouchers for sums paid you A Yes I usually write sums off on a warrant of attorney but do not recollect whether we did so in this case - I have not looked at it to ascertain - there was 18l due - the bill was for 30l - I do not know Dobson - I never spoke to him - the warrant of attorney is field in the office at the Court of King s Bench - it has been out of my possession since December or January MR ADOLPHUS Q You field the warrant in December A Yes there is an Act of Parliament obliging me to file a warrant of attorney - I had not any idea that the bill was forged at the time it was given to me THOMAS RICHARDSON TRAPPS I am a drysalter living in Leadenhall-street - I was at Mr Venning s at the time the bill was given by the prisoner - the prisoner and Mr Gee wrote on the warrant of attorney - the prisoner told me an action had been brought against him and Mr Gee by Venning and Co - and as I knew Messrs Venning he asked me if I would go and stop the action - I went and spoke to Mr Venning - the prisoner said if I could stop the action he would give the acceptance of his brother-in-law Mr Dobson - and it was in consequence of that the bill was given - I was present when the bill was drawn and when it was given to Mr Venning as being accepted looking at it - I have known Mr Dobson about fifteen months and have seen him write several times - I have endorsed this bill myself but at the time did not look at the acceptance - I have seen Dobson write repeatedly and on close examination I do not believe it to be his handwriting Cross-examined Q You endorsed it without seeing whether it was accepted A Yes I knew I was rendering myself liable - I saw it was accepted but did not scrutinize the acceptance - I looked at the name - I endorsed the bill to oblige the prisoner - as Mr Venning said if I endorsed it he would take it - I read the name in which it was accepted - I never satisfied myself whether it was a genuine signature or not - I was merely doing a friendly action to serve the prisoner - I knew the prisoner and Dobson were related - I did not know they were intimate - I had not known Dobson s handwriting particularly well - but I have seen him write several times since that and before COURT Q Has he been writing in your presence and called your attention to his writing since desiring you to look at his writing A I have seen him write since - I do not know that he has written in my presence and called my attention to it since this - I have seen him write two or three times since - I will swear I have seen him write three times Q Did he write for the very purpose of your seeing his handwriting A He has certainly MR ADOLPHUS Q Did the prisoner produce the Bill of Exchange A Yes - it did not enter into my mind that it was a forgery - I believed it was a genuine bill and put my name on it without examining it particularly - I am now of opinion it is not Dobson s handwriting - he wrote several times in my presence before the bill was in existence - he has since written in my presence that I might be able to prove it hereafter within these two months - if he had not done that I should have given the same evidence exactly as I do now - that I do not believe it to be his handwriting having seen him write previously JOHN GEE I was a party to a Bill of Exchange and was in some trouble concerning it - I am a party to the bill in question also as an endorser - I do not know the handwriting of Dobson WILLIAM DOBSON This Bill of Exchange is not my handwriting - I never accepted this bill nor authorized or empowered the prisoner to accept it - I knew nothing of it till it was presented to me and refused payment Cross-examined Q What line of life are you in A An officer of Excise and have been so thirty-three years- I am not always in want of money - at one time I was not- I am at present and have been so of late years rather - I have been a party to Bills of Exchange but only for my brother-in-law on no other occasion - I certainly accepted some Bills of Exchange for him but not latterly - I never made a trade of accepting bills - I began to accept Bills of Exchange I suppose about three years ago or four years between three and four - I will swear I did not begin so long as five years ago - I have accepted small bills you may say twenty years ago - I do not suppose I have accepted two bills for twenty years till four years ago - can I recollect twenty years ago - I swear to the best of my recollection I have not accepted ten bills but I will not say positively - the two acceptances were small ones - I do not recollect the sums - I do not recollect these things after they are past - I have accepted about eight or nine bills for the last five years - it is not fifteen or twenty - it is not much more than half fifteen - I cannot swear to any number I have accepted - the prisoner is the only person I have accepted for - I do not mean the only person in the world - I have accepted for four or five more I should suppose besides him - they were bills for 5l or 6l for tradesmen - that would not distress me to pay - my salary in the Excise is 120l a year - I am a married man and have one child - I have accepted bills where I have received no value a great many times rather too many times for me - I was obliged to pay them - I have accepted them out of friendship where I have got no value five or six times chiefly for my brother-in-law - I have accepted none for the last half-year Q Did you not tell me that within the last five years you accepted five or six bills for persons not your brother-in-law A No for people in trade who I dealt with - the largest sum I have accepted for I may say was about 10l or 11l not 20l - I have accepted a bill for Mr Collins a cheesemonger within the last twelve months - I dealt with him - I owed him money and gave him that bill - I never accepted bills where I did not own money except for my brother-in-law - I have accepted about twelve bills for my brother-in-law - I do not mean to swear positively I have not accepted more than that but to the best of my recollection 50l was the largest sum I ever accepted for him and for which I got no value - I have stood accountable for the bills and given security for them - I have mortgaged some land for it which I have at Merton in Surrey - I have about half an acre there and a house upon it Q Have the kindness to tell me whether you did not very lately accept a 40l bill A I do not recollect that Idid - I paid a bill to the butcher nearly a year ago - the prisoner was a party to that bill - I was not the accepter - I think Gee was - there have been bill transactions between the prisoner and Gee - I have not seen my wife here tonight COURT Q You say you have had bill transactions with Gee A Yes I suppose he has seen me write - he has received bills of me and acted on them MR PHILLIPS Q A good many six or eight A No - he must have seen some of course - he saw the one the prisoner was sued on no doubt as he was the accepter - I should think Gee has held about two bills to which I have been a party or three at the farthest - he did not discount any of my bills at any time - I cannot tell whether he endorsed any - he only accepted the one I have talked of - the prisoner had drawn the bill - Gee accepted it and I endorsed it - we were all upon that bill - we were not together when it was drawn - he saw Harris afterwards- the bill was produced and of course he saw my handwriting on it - there was one or two more bills with my handwriting which he saw and which I conversed with him about - I do not think he had more than one or two we will say three at a guess on which my handwriting was and to which Gee was a party - he might have been drawer or endorser for what I remember - I cannot mention the amount of the bills - I was liable for them - I mortgaged the land at Merton for 200l but there have been mortgages on it since - I suppose the whole mortgages are about 450l - I made the last mortgage about two months ago before this transaction arose - I had accounts to make up which made me mortgage - I had one bill out for 50l - I had bills I was answerable for for the prisoner - I had accepted them - I think the last bill I accepted for him was about May or June - it was about 25l I believe Q Was your wife ever present at a conversation about bills A Not that I remember - there was a 30l bill offered last June and she persuaded me not to accept it and I never accepted one since - she might have been present at conversations between the prisoner and myself about Bills of Exchange but not lately - she has been present at times but not for six months - she might formerly Q Have you not in her presence before the last six months given the prisoner permission to use your name - on your solemn oath A No I never did or why should I refuse that Bill of Exchange - I have never given him authority to accept bills for me to any amount not to my knowledge or belief - I will swear I did not - I do not recollect any thing of the kind - I should be quite beside myself to do so - I swear I did not authorize any person - I never gave the prisoner authority to sign my name as acceptor or party to a bill - I never knew of his doing so- my wife never did it in my presence with my consent - I am not at present living with my wife - we have been separated a few weeks probably - I have come here from Horsemonger-lane Gaol where I am on account of his bills and one thing or another - I have not been separated from my wife through any disagreement MR ADOLPHUS Q The prisoner is your wife s brother A Yes - I have accepted bills for him when I have had no consideration for them - it is about four years ago since I began accepting bills for his accommodation - I could pay my way well before that but since that I have become less able to pay my way and do justice to my creditors - I have been responsible for this man - in June last I determined to accept no more bills for him - I was then obliged to mortgage my property to cover the different securities I had engaged in for him - I had had that property six or eight years - before I got involved in bill transactions for him I did not think of mortgaging it - I lived within my income until then - I have lived apart from my wife merely on account of being in prison that is the only reason - we still I hope agree - she has interfered on the prisoner s behalf with me since this happened - she came to me about it - it is natural enough - she has done so Q Now I ask you again though she is capable of being called did you ever in her presence in any way give this man leave to write your name in any way whatever A I did not - I never heard or knew of this bill till it was presented for payment WILLIAM FIDLER I am clerk to Messrs Ridley and Osmond attornies - I know Dobson - I have seen him write very often - I am well acquainted with his handwriting looking at the acceptance - I do not believe that to be his handwriting - I have seen him write for upwards of three years very often MR VENNING re-examined I received the bill from the prisoner at my office No 2 Bucklersbury in the City Prisoner s Defence written Mr Dobson the principal witness against me has been on terms of the greatest intimacy with me for years and even placed in the situation I am I envy him not his feelings after appearing here and giving the evidence he has done this day HARRIETT FLEMING DOBSON I am the prosecutor s wife I have known my husband and my brother to be concerned in bill transactions -

I have been present several times when my husband and my brother have been talking about Bills of Exchange - they were very friendly and intimate together and about last August twelvemonth my brother came to ask my husband the favour of putting his name to a bill and he gave his consent for him to do so for him - he asked him to put his name to a bill - I cannot exactly say his words - he gave his word that he would - he promised to accept the bill for him - I do not know whether the bill was produced - the prisoner asked him to accept the bill - my husband told him to do it himself and that would answer the same purpose MR ADOLPHUS Q This man is your brother A Yes he asked my husband to accept a bill - my husband told him to accept it himself for that would do as well - this passed last August twelvemonths at No 18 Albany-road - my husband has been sued and brought to considerable difficulties since that by accepting bills for my brother - he is not ruined Q Have you been to him in prison to beg him to vary his evidence and not to hurt your brother I have COURT Q Do you know of your husband having accepted other bills to which the prisoner was not a party A Yes I do not know that my husband refused to accept any more bills for my brother - I do not recollect my brother applying and my husband refusing to accept any more bills for him - my husband has not to my knowledge refused to accept bills for the prisoner - I swear I never heard him refuse - I know nothing about it any further - it is very seldom I have been present when my husband has been asked to accept bills for him - I have not heard him refuse to accept bills for him - it may be four or five months ago since I last saw the prisoner in my husband s presence -

I found the street door open - I went up stairs to the first floor back room - I went first and found the door fast - I burst it open with my shoulder and found Peapall against the door - I almost knocked him down with the force - I found Miller standing on the left hand side of the fire place looking towards the fire-place - as soon as I entered the room he turned round and looked at me and I saw something drop from his hand - it fell into the ashes - I then told my brother officer to lay hold of him - I took it up it was a file - I went up to Hunt as he sat on the right hand side of the fire-place in his shirt sleeves which were tucked up- I saw him pass something to Shipley who stood on his left hand side about a yard from him at the table it was wrapped up in a bit of rag - she dropped it the moment he gave it to her and as she dropped it I saw some white metal in a liquid state fall from it on the table - I then picked it up and feeling it hot I dropped it - I picked it up again and put it into my hat - it was a mould with half-a-crown in it - these are the same - I told my brother officer to secure Shipley - I had then got Hunt against the fire-place in the chair - I told him not to move - when he saw me turn my head towards the woman he struck a pipkin which was on the fire containing white metal in a liquid state -

it was loaded - what Hunt handed to Shipley was hot - I believe he dropped it - Peapall tried to make his escape directly I got into the room - he did not touch any of the implements - I was once in St Catherine s Dock and left because it did not suit me - I was not dismissed - there was never any charge made against me for stealing brandy nor of stealing a donkey except by people of this sort - there is no charge in the least against me in the police - I was never accused in my life of making false charges against any body Q Are you not now under suspicion and only allowed to wear your uniform till this trial is over A I am not - I was three years in St Catherine s Docks - I went from there to Mr Freeman s stone-wharf Millbank and left him on purpose to join the police - Miller had a file in his hand - that was all I saw him do - I have seen Hunt go backwards and forwards there night and day - I know he lived there - I had seen Peapall in the street about an hour or half an hour before - it was more than half an hour - I had been watching the house for a good while - I saw Peapall at the end of the street with a good many more - I did not continue watching - sometimes I had other business - I was not watching the house all that day - I was watching it for twenty minutes before I went in - in the course of that twenty minutes I saw some women go in - it is a kind of lodging-house - Peapall was not one of those persons - I do not know the name of any body who went in - it is a general house for these kind of people - three or four different families lodge there WILLIAM CLIFTON I am a policeman I went with Goose and the other constable - I followed them into the room - as soon as I got in I laid hold of Peapall - I have heard the evidence of Goose - I have nothing to add to it - I saw every thing he has stated - this bottle containing plaster of Paris I found standing on a chair in the room and this tin band was in a cupboard MICHAEL ELLIOTT I am a policeman I assisted in apprehending the prisoners - I have heard the evidence of the last two witnesses and agree to what they state as far as I was present - I found two bad half-crowns one on the table and one on the floor - I stopped Peapall who was making his escape and when I took Hunt I searched him and found three good shillings on him - when I entered the room Miller dropped something - Goose picked it up - it proved to be a file and I saw him heave away half-a-crown which Booth took up - I took Peapall to the station-house - they met Bill Ballard - we were all close together in Orchard-street - Ballard wanted to know what was the matter and I think it was Hunt said It is all up - Peapall said nothing JOHN BOOTH I went with the other officers - I saw Miller throw half-a-crown down - I picked it up - I confirm the evidence of Elliott MARY ANN WARD I am the wife of William Ward of No 7 New-street Pye-street He works at Hammersmith - Shipley came to me for a lodging about two months before she was taken - she came to me at No 7 New-street Pye-street - she looked at the second floor back room in No 10 - she returned and gave 1s earnest for the room at 3s 6d per week - she called herself a single woman and paid the rent until she was taken - I went to the room once and saw Hunt there and only him and Shipley Cross-examined Q At that time did you observe any thing wrong A Not in the least - Hunt was washing himself there JOHN FIELD I am an inspector of counterfeit coin to his Majesty s mint I have been experienced in coin several years - this is a plaster of Paris mould for casting a half-crown - it has the impression of the obverse and reverse side of a half-crown and appears to have been used - here is a good half-crown and the mould appears to have been made with this good half-crown - this is a counterfeit half-crown which has been made in the mould - it agrees in date and every thing - it is the half-crown found in the mould - these two half-crowns produced by a witness are both counterfeit and the same in all respects as the other - they were cast in this mould and the one found on Miller is the same - this file has white metal in the teeth of it such as would be used to remove the surplus metal from the edge - these spoons are the same metal as the base coin and here is a pipkin with white metal of a similar description in it and this tin hand appears to have been used in forming the mould to keep it together while the plaster of Paris was in a liquid state - this tobacco-pipe has some white metal in the bowl and might be used to ladle the metal out of the pipkin - this is plaster of Paris in the bottle Hunt s Defence I went up to No 10 Pye-street as I knew this girl as a friend and had something to drink with her - I left word at the public-house that Peapall was to call there for his tobacco-box - he came and was going out when the policeman broke the door open and swore he would blow my b - y brains out if I stirred Shipley s Defence Hunt came into my room about half an hour previous - he sent me out for six pennyworth of rum - I went and fetched it - I had occasion to go to two or three different places - I was not gone more than half an hour - I returned - we drank the liquor and when I returned the other two prisoners were in the room - I returned with a bottle which I had borrowed at the inn and keeping on my bonnet and shawl I came down stairs a second time - I threw my shawl on the chair immediately went to the bed and put my bonnet inside the bed and was returning from the bed having occasion to go out again when the policemen surprised me by the sudden entrance - the first policeman who entered to the best of my knowledge was Goose - he flew to Hunt - two others flew to the others and the fourth stationed himself with his back towards the door - they bid me stand in the same position as I was in when they entered which I did - when they searched the other prisoners a policeman came and searched me - then he left me in care of another while he took the three prisoners to the station-house - then came back and took me Miller s Defence I came up to the room knocking at the door - the prisoner Shipley let me in - I went for a clean shirt she had of mine and in five or ten minutes Goose arrived - he immediately rushed to Hunt put the pistol to his head and said he would blow his b - y brains out if he moved - he could not see me for I was behind him and he took a false oath that it was I dropped the file - I had nothing to do with it - a policeman laid hold of me and took an oath I had thrown one across the room but I had nothing in my hand - when Clifton went to give his evidence Goose was behind him putting the words into his mouth Peapall s Defence I live at No 4 New Peter-street I was returning home - I called on Hunt for a tobacco-box I had given him the night before and forgotten and was not in the room three minutes when Goose rushed in - I was taken to the station-house - Goose came and said Peapall I am sorry for you for I saw you go in not five minutes before myself - a soldier was in the place and heard it and they would not allow him to give his evidence - he is in the 15th Hussars and is gone to Ireland or he could take his oath I had not been there five minutes William Sampson tinman of No 16 Silver-street Golden-square John Garrett coal-dealer of No 12 Lancaster-court New Bond-street Christopher Hartland porter and William Reynolds porter of No 5 Lancaster-court gave the prisoner Peapall a good character John Watkins publican of Leicester-street Regent-street Martha Bowen of No 7 Wallis-place Pimlico and S Aclin of Great Guildford-street gave the prisoner Miller a good character Valentine Barnes of No 13 Sackville-place Mile End-road gave the prisoner Shipley a good character HUNT -

the street door was open - we entered and went to the back parlour - I found the door fastened inside - I pushed against it but could not get in - it might have been only shut - Ashton and I pushed against the door and broke it in - on entering the room I saw the prisoner there - there was a very good fire in the grate - he was standing by the side of the fire on the hearth - his coat was off and he was in his shirt sleeves - he had got something in his hand which he threw down on the hearth - it was something white like plaster-of-paris - it broke with the fall - I knocked him back into a chair and there held him - Lloyd came up and handcuffed him - his shirt sleeves were tucked up - I went to the hearth and picked up the pieces of a mould made of plaster-of-paris quite hot - I also picked up two counterfeit shillings on the hearth - they were quite warm - I took out of the fire a tobacco pipe three parts full of white metal melted - there was a frying-pan on the fire with some small pieces of white plaster in it - on the table I found a small file with white metal in the teeth of it - I took them away and produce them - I put the pieces of the mould together and there was part of the impression of the head and tail of a shilling on it WILLIAM BAKER ASHTON I am a policeman I went with the officers and saw the prisoner throw the white mould which I produce out of his hand - it broke to pieces on the hearth - that is different to the one Fryer produces- it was quite hot so that I could not hold it - it has been put together since - the prisoner s sleeves were up and he was in the act of stamping on the mould which Fryer has produced when we entered the room - Fryer knocked him back and secured him in the chair - I picked up this shilling with a get at the end of it - it had just come out of the mould and was so hot I was obliged to put it down - I found behind a picture this little book - the prisoner said That is only the rent book - you need not take that away - while I was searching the room I said to him You were very quick old fellow - Yes said he if you had been half a minute longer you would have got nothing ANDREW LLOYD I am a police-officer of Hatton-garden I accompanied the officers to Collingwood-street and entered the room with them - I handcuffed the prisoner immediately afterwards - I searched him but found nothing on his person - I found a fryingpan on the fire almost redhot and a spoon covered with plaster-of-paris - there was some plaster in the fryingpan -

I let to the prisoner the room in which he was taken JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coins to the Mint This appears to have been a plaster-of-paris mould - it was produced by Fryer - it is for casting shillings - on one side of it is part of the impression of the obverse side of a shilling and on the other side part of the impression of the reverse side of a shilling - the mould appears to have been used for casting but it is now broken - here are two finished counterfeit shillings produced by the same officer and I believe were cast in this mould - they are made of britannia-metal which is very easily fused - the tobacco pipe has the same description of metal in the bowl of it - the file has the appearance of white metal in the teeth and is used to remove the projection on the surface - another mould produced by Ashton is of a similar description and has part of the impression of both sides of a shilling - this mould has not been used - the shilling produced by Ashton is counterfeit and has the get to it - this shilling was cast in the first mould - Hall has produced six shillings - they are all counterfeit and cast in the first mould one still having the get - the other five are finished - the spoon has been used to mix plaster-of-paris- all these articles are what are used to cast counterfeit coin Prisoner s Defence written On the evening previous to the day named in my indictment the man who laid the information against me whom I have known about twelve months came to me while I was on Shoreditch coach-stand with my cab and asked me if I should be at home next morning - I replied Yes and told him to call in the morning - he knew where I resided in consequence of his residing at No 5 in the same street and under the same landlady as myself - he came according to appointment and asked me if I would allow him to do a little job at my house - I asked him what it was - he said not of much consequence but he could not very well do it at home and he would not be more than half an hour - I agreed accordingly and then went to my father s on Cambridge-heath on a little business and left him at my home - when I returned I asked him what he was doing - I saw six shillings on the table which proved to be base - he said to me Hold this meaning the mould which he had in his hand and said he wanted to step home and that he would return in five minutes - he then instructed me what to do during his absence - he had not been absent five minutes before the door was burst open- this was his plan to insuare me so that he could insure his object I have since been informed that he is a most notorious coiner and utterer about the neighbourhood of Field-lane and Smithfield -

R Aickman Feloniously did offer utter dispose of and put off with the said forged endorsement of the said bill of exchange with intent to defraud Richard Gosling and others he well knowing the same to be forged against the Statute 2nd COUNT like the first only with intent to defraud Robert Aikman 3rd and 4th COUNTS like the first and second only omitting to set out the instrument MESSRS BODKIN and LEE conducted the Prosecution GEORGE STRANGE I am cashier to Richard Gosling Benjamin Sharp and others who are bankers in Fleet-street The Marquis of Bristol kept an account with us - I knew the prisoner as being one his lordship s establishment - looking at a bill on the 30th of January the prisoner presented this bill for payment - at that time this endorsement R Aickman was on the back of it and nothing more - after some little hesitation about the endorsement I paid the bill - this receipt above the endorsement and the prisoner s name below it was written by the prisoner after he presented it - the prisoner said he received it for Mr Aikman Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q He said he received it for Aikman A Yes I saw him write Received for and his name - I am positive the name of Aickman was there before he wrote that - the regular way of receipting a bill of exchange would have been to have written Received and his own name if he received it for himself - a banker s clerk always signs as received for the firm - if he had received it for himself I should not have paid the money as I knew he was not Mr Aikman Q If he had presented the bill and written on it Received J Aikman that would have done A Yes If he had said it was paid him by Aikman as I knew him I should have made some inquiry - if a stranger had presented it that would have been another thing - there was some difficulty in making out the name - there is a blot on the name - I am not certain the blot was on the name when it was presented - it might have been blotted at the time he wrote or not - I cannot say MR BODKIN Q Would the bill be payable at all without the endorsement R Aikman on it A Certainly not ROBERT AIKMAN I am a tailor and carry on business at Roehampton I was employed by Lord Bristol - in January last I had a demand on his Lordship for 184l 9s - I delivered a bill to that amount to the prisoner about the 18th of January - this is the bill looking at it - I have been paid the amount of the bill since this investigation - I received no payment from the prisoner for it at any time - this receipt is not my handwriting nor did I authorize any body to write it - I never received any bill from the prisoner for payment of my bill or authorized him or any body to endorse any bill - the endorsement on this bill is not my handwriting nor was it done with my authority - it is not spelt right - my name has no c in it - after delivering my bill in January I called at Lord Bristol s to see the prisoner on Saturday morning the 29th of January - I spoke to him about my bill and he said my cheque would be up the beginning of the week from his Lordship - I went there on the 5th February again and saw him - I asked him if I might write down to his Lordship at Ickworth on the subject of his bill - I saw him at Lord Bristol s house at Putney-heath - he told me to call next day at twelve o clock and I should receive my money - I went next day - I could not find him - I made every inquiry for him afterwards but without success Cross-examined Q You never gave him authority to put your name on that bill A No I did not - I never saw that bill - I might authorize him to put my name on some papers but not such a thing as this - never on any bill of exchange or order for the payment of money - he once drew a bill on me for 10l for his own accommodation- this is the bill looking at it - I never accepted any other accommodation bill for him nor he for me Q You say you may have given him leave to put your name on something or other what do you mean A That bill - that is all - I suffer that to be drawn on me - he did not put my name on it - the acceptance is my own handwriting - I put that name myself - I cannot tell you what I authorized him to write my name on - I did not give him a general leave to use my name - not any thing except this Q You told me you gave him leave on some occasions to use your name did you not A No I did not - I have not given him permission in any way - this 10l bill was outstanding at the time the Marquis s bill came to him MR BODKIN Q Did you ever in your life authorize him to write your name on any bill of exchange or draft or order for payment of money A No I permitted him to draw that 10l bill on me COURT Q Do you know of the prisoner having written your name on any other paper with your permission A No THOMAS HARVEY In January last I was in Lord Bristol s employ - looking at an account this is in the prisoner s handwriting - in February last by the direction of Lord Bristol I went to Roehampton - I did not find the prisoner there - I made inquiry - I afterwards inquired in town at his Lordship s residence but did not find him - I went into a public-house in Crown-court St James s on the 8th of February and called for a glass of ale and while they were drawing the ale I heard somebody come in - I took the ale off the counter turned round and saw the prisoner come in - the moment he saw me he turned round and went out - I put my glass of ale down went out into the passage and into the court but I did not overtake him - it being a very foggy night I lost sight of him - I afterwards made inquiry for him but could not find him Cross-examined Q Where did you see him A In Crown-court at the Red Lion - I was standing - he came in behind me - I have not a doubt he saw me or he would not have gone out - he never spoke to me - he saw me for he turned out - he looked at me - I was in my livery Prisoner I had no apartments in St James s-square Witness No not at his Lordship s house THE MOST NOBLE THE MARQUIS OF BRISTOL The prisoner was in my employ as house-steward for about a year and a quarter - he ceased to be so in October or November last - I employed him afterwards to pay the Christmas bills for the year he had been in my employ - I did that as a mark of confidence he having been ten months in my employ in that year and being satisfied of his honesty - in January I was staying at Ickworth-hall Bury - I received from the prisoner a list of the outstanding bills - here is an account of a bill due to Aikman - it is spelt Aickman - to the amount of 184l 9s - the different tradesmen s bills were forwarded to me after they were paid - I think not with the list - it was always my custom on receiving lists of the bills to enclose drafts for the amount to the prisoner - this bill looking at it is drawn by me and was forwarded to the prisoner with others - I sent my steward for the stamps - there could have been no endorsement on the back of it of course but I did not look at the backs of each of them - I afterwards received this receipt from the prisoner for Aikman s account Cross-examined Q You sent orders for money with this A Yes altogether - I cannot say that every one of them came faithfully into the hands of the parties - there were a great many and all came back duly receipted except two and I ascertained that those two persons happened to be out the day he called to pay them - I transmitted this bill to the prisoner probably the same evening as I drew it - I addressed them to him at Roehampton or St James s-square The bill was here put in and read also a receipt for the amount signed R Aickman Prisoner s Defence My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury although unfortunately placed in this degrading situation I will not encroach on your time except to assure you of the absence of any improper motives on my part when I gave the receipt for Aikman s money not having had any intention of misappropriating his money - on that day I paid several tradesmen s bills and by drinking with them I got intoxicated - not having time to pay Aikman I sent his Lordship all the receipts that night as he requested and knowing his Lordship would feel disappointed at not receiving the receipts I thought it no harm to send a receipt for Aikman intending to pay him the following morning but unfortunately for me in a state of intoxication I entered a gaming-house where I believe I lost all the money - this was inquired into by the officer and found to be true - the only recollection I have of the affair is that I went to the gaming-house - perceiving the loss I sustained next morning I wrote to my friends for money to pay Aikman - Gentlemen you have heard from the cashier to Goslings that he knew me - can you then or any thinking men suppose as I was known there that I should myself have presented the cheque if I intended a forgery or a fraud - Might not the money have been obtained without my appearing for it or giving my receipt for it - if fraud had been my intent should not I have appropriated the whole sum to my purpose and have left the country - in obtaining the money I acted by the desire of Aikman - he authorized me to receive it - there was nobody to take up the £10 bill where it was payable - he authorized me to receive this money for the purpose - I admit receiving it and writing the receipt but through the losses I sustained I could not pay him - having received it by his desire he knew he had no claim on Lord Bristol or the banker - hence the origin of my being accused of forgery - by charging me with forgery he secures himself from the loss - I hope from your knowledge of business and the world you will not submit me to the sentence of having committed forgery GUILTY Aged 32 -

Goose came to me and I went to No 19 Duck-lane Westminster accompanied by Goose and Sullivan police constable - we went in at the front door through the passage and met a little girl - we passed her and went to a back room in the yard - the little girl called out Father - I found the door of a room on the left hand side of the yard open - as I entered I saw the prisoner sitting on the right hand side of the fire-place with something in his hand which I took from him - it was the moulds for the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling - the fire was lighted - I seized the mould and from it fell some white liquid metal on the hearth - it splashed on my trowsers - I opened the mould and found a small quantity of metal in it - the prisoner looked up and said Hollo hollo what is the matter - I said It is all right enough you know what is the matter - I took him into custody and gave him to Sullivan and Goose - he said to Goose Let me alone Bob and I will go with you quietly - I searched the room and in a drawer of the table at which he sat I found two files with white metal in the teeth and two small hammers and on a shelf at a short distance I found a new Britannia metal spoon and hanging on the shelf a bag of plaster of Paris - this piece of white metal I picked up on the hearth - this white metal was in the impression part of the mould and here is part of the impression on it ROBERT GOOSE I am a policeman I accompanied Banister and Sullivan - as I entered the room the prisoner sat on the right hand side of the fire-place with something in his hand - as soon as he saw us he put something into his mouth - I saw Mr Banister take something out of his hand- he gave him to me - I said he had better give me what he had in his mouth it would make the case neither better nor worse - and out of his mouth he put a counterfeit shilling which I produce - on the table I found sixteen more counterfeit shillings - he told me he would go quietly with me and said it was all up with him that he was obliged to do it for he could get no work - in the drawer I found a file containing white metal - I found in the drawer a pair of nippers with the file and white metal in the teeth of them - on the hob I found a tobacco-pipe with white metal in it - on the shelf I found a piece of tin with plaster of Paris adhering to it - I searched him and found a knife with plaster of Paris on the handle and blade - I then made a further search in the back yard and in the privy behind the seat I found another mould for a sixpence JURY Q Was the metal in the tobacco-pipe hot or cold A It was warm - it was on the side of the fire - the pipe was not full - there was sufficient fire to melt the metal - the hot metal was all running through the fire on to the ashes underneath CORNELIUS SPOTTISWOOD SULLIVAN I am a policeman I accompanied the witnesses to the place - I have heard their evidence and agree with them - I found nothing myself JOSEPH WARDLE I am the owner of the house in Duck-lane The prisoner was my tenant and has been so five or six years - he is a bricklayer and occasionally worked for me - he had the whole house JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin to his Majesty s Mint and have been so many years This is a plaster of Paris mould to cast counterfeit shillings - it has on one part of it the obverse side of the impression of a shilling and on the other the reverse side of a shilling - it appears to have been used for the purpose of casting - it is discoloured - here is some white metal which seems similar to the shilling produced - the first shilling is counterfeit which was taken from his mouth - the other seventeen are also counterfeit of the same description and I believe theyhave all been cast in this mould - they are all unfinished but in a state apparently intended to pass for the current coin - here are two which have been filed sufficient to go into circulation - the white metal spoon is similar metal to the coin - the tin appears to have been used as a band for making the mould Prisoner s Defence written I am charged with coining it is a base conspiracy to obtain the reward which his Majesty s Mint gives on such occasions I was sitting in my back parlour when Henry Wilson called on me and asked me to let him leave the things which the officer found on the table while he went to fetch a file he had not left my place more than five minutes when the officers came in and apprehended me on the charge of coining To deny that the coin was not there or that I did not know that it was bad would be saying that which no man would believe - but as to making them it is entirely false I implore you to investigate this case with mercy and consideration As for the police-constable Goose he has been a convicted felon and was confined in the Brixton House of Correction for the term of six months and has been discharged from the police-force two or three times for his misconduct I told the police where they could apprehend Henry Wilson but they would not do it for their object is to gain the reward from the mint The file found in the drawer of the table is what I have always used as a steel to strike a light with belonging to my tinder-box and the plaster of Paris found hanging up against the window is what I use in my trade I being a plasterer GUILTY -

t18341016-53  Before Mr Justice Gaselee 1528 WILLIAM PAGE and MARY ANN EDWARDS were indicted for that they on the 3rd of October at St Margaret Westminster 4 pieces of counterfeit coin resembling and apparently intended to resemble and pass for the King s current silver coin called half-crowns feloniously did falsely make and counterfeit against the Statute &c MESSRS SCARLETT and ELLIS conducted the Prosecution ROBERT GOOSE I am a policeman On the 3rd of October I was with Banister and Martin Smith - I went to the house No 47 Orchard-street with them to the one pair back room - the street door was open - the one pair back room door was locked - I gave three thrusts against it and the door gave way - Smith and Banister were behind me - I went in and passed another man and the female prisoner - I made up to the male prisoner - the other man stood just inside the door and the female prisoner at the table - I saw the male prisoner sitting on a chair on the left hand side of the fire-place about a yard from it - as soon as he saw me he rose up - he had no coat on and his shirt sleeves were tucked up above his elbows - as soon as I got up to him I got hold of him - he had something in a cloth which he put between his knees - he had the cloth in his lap when I entered - he rose up and threw something towards the fire out of his lap - I believe he had an apron on but I did not not see it - he threw some counterfeit half-crowns from his lap - I ascertained them to be counterfeit five minutes afterwards - they fell into the ashes - he had the towel in his hand and stooped down to press it together and from the towel fell one half of a mould and in his hand I saw the other part of the mould with the half-crown in it- he would not leave off destroying them till I struck him in the eye - he then dropped down and dropped the towel with part of the mould in it - the moulds were broken all to pieces in the scramble - he struggled very hard and we could not get him away before he had destroyed them - both pieces were broken entirely - here is the towel the mould was in - the blood on it came from him when I struckhim - I took him into custody and gave him to Smith - I searched him and found a good half-crown in his pocket covered with plaster of Paris - there is some on it now - in the fire place I found four counterfeit half-crowns in the ashes where I had seen him throw something away - there was a very strong fire and a pipkin on it containing white metal in a boiling state - it has the metal in it now - on the hob I found a tobacco-pipe containing white metal and on the small hob a metal spoon of the same sort of metal as was in the pipkin - on the shelf I found four more counterfeit half-crowns in a finished state in a piece of paper - I found a get alongside where he sat - I found some wearing apparel belonging to the female prisoner which I gave her at night - she made her escape out of the room and came to my house at night for her clothes and I took her into custody SAMUEL BANISTER I accompanied the officers - I followed Goose into the room - I observed the window had the curtain drawn before it - the two prisoners were the only persons I saw in the room which was extremely dark- it was a very foggy morning and the window was shaded by the curtain - there might be two or three more without their being seen - the woman got away - I was immediately behind Goose - the first thing I saw was a struggle between Page and Goose - I went to assist Goose - Page was sitting in a chair near the fire-place - he got up and made a rush at the fire - Goose laid hold of him struggled with him and struck him - he sat down and squeezed something between his knees - I saw something white drop and picked up some pieces of the mould - I found four counterfeit half-crowns in the fire-place - I found some waste pieces of mould about the room and a bag of plaster of Paris in a closet in the room and a piece of white metal on a shelf in the same closet Page Q Did you see the young woman there A Yes - she was in the centre of the room - she might be coming to the door but did not appear so MARTIN SMITH I accompanied Banister and Goose - when we entered the house I saw a man standing in the middle of the room and Edwards against the table - Page sat in a chair by the side of the fire-place with his coat off his shirt sleeves tucked up and a towel in his hand with something in it - Goose said If you do not give that up I will knock you down and immediately struck him a blow on the head and as he fell back the towel fell from his hand with something in it - I immediately took the prisoner and took him to the other side of the room - I secured him while Banister and Goose searched the room and found what they have produced WILLIAM CORSTER I am agent to Mr Walton landlord of the house the prisoners live in I let the first floor back room to the male prisoner in October - he paid the rent and occupied it about seven weeks previous to the 3rd of October - I have seen Edwards there at different times casually but I did not consider her a lodger - she was there at times - I did not see her for the first two or three weeks JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint and have been so a great number of years I have had experience in matters of this sort - this half-crown produced by Goose is counterfeit - it is the one which fell from the mould - here are also eight other counterfeit half-crown- the first five produced are impressions from the same mould the other four are not impressed from that mould - here is a good half-crown which Goose produced which appears to have been the half-crown that made the- all the thirteen half-crowns produced have been made from moulds made from the same good half-crown and only nine of them from the mould produced - the good half-crown has made more than one mould - Banister his produced some broken pieces of a plaster of Paris mould which has been used for casting half-crowns - here are five pieces of a mould having parts of the impressions of the obverse side of a half-crown - here are parts of the letters and date and here are three other pieces having parts of impressions of the reverse side - I believe nine half-crowns have been made in this mould when perfect - the four finished are not from the same mould - this pipkin has white metal in it of a description like the counterfeit even - this spoon is of the same white metal as the counterfeit coin and such as is usually used to melt for casting coin - this tobacco-pipe has white metal in it of a similar description and may have been used to lade metal out of the pipkin - this get fits the channel of the mould through which the metal flows down into the impression Page Q I wish to know whether you say that is a mould A These are parts of what I believe has been a mould Page s Defence written You have heard the evidence adduced in support of this charge and I leave it with you to determine as to my guilt or innocence but at the same time I confidently rely on your verdict The only circumstance at all implicating me in that offence is the finding of some whitening in the room from which I was taken and which I am in the habit of using or causing to be used for the purpose of cleaning the hearth - which the police preternd was used by me for the purpose of forming moulds - a corresponding circumstance and which in a great measure leads to my being thus charged was the circumstance of the melted metal being on the fire this I was about to form into a weight for a pully to the spring of a pigeontrap - the circumstance of having counterfeit coin found in the room I cannot attempt to deny but many other persons had access to the same room and I do most solemnly deny that any thing was found in my possession to justify this prosecution - when the police arrived there was no person on the premises but myself the female was only an occasional visitor at my lodgings and was gone out at the time the officers came to search my room for some milk for my tea - whatever verdict you may see proper to return as it regards me I do most solemnly protest the female prisoner is innocent of having done any offence in conjunction with me PAGE - GUILTY Aged - Transported for Life EDWARDS -

impressed the figure and apparent resemblance of the obverse side of the King s current silver coin called a shilling against the Statue &c —2nd COUNT Substituting the word reverse for obverse —3rd COUNT Stating that he had in his possession a mould impressed with the obverse side of a sixpence —4th COUNT Stating it to be the reverse side of a sixpence MR GURNEY conducted the Prosecution ROBERT GOOSE I am a policeman On the 16th of October I went to No 1 Greystock-place Tothill-fields with Bannister and Clifton—I went to the top of the house the two-pair front room and found the door closed—I rapped at it—the prisoner and I both opened it at the same time—I told him we were officers that we had information that he was carrying on coining and we must search the place—he said we were welcome to do it—he was in his shirt sleeves—there was a strong fire in the room—I took him into custody—I searched the room and under the fire place up in one corner on the right hand side I found a mould which I produce—there was a lad in the room and a little girl and his wife and an infant in bed—I found a spoon with white metal in it in a table-drawer and in a trunk in the room I found a file with white metal in the teeth and a piece of linen with a lot of platter of Paris—I did not search the prisoner—he said he knew nothing about the things and afterwards he said some man had left them there—he did not say who at that time—asked who was the occupier of the room—he said he was—I found part of a tobacco-pipe—there was nothing in it and I broke it SAMUEL BANNISTER I was in company with Goose—I have been in Court—I agree with the account he gives as far as it goes—I went about five o clock in the evening there and found the room very dark and the persons Goose has described in it—I went down stairs to get a candle and when I returned I found Goose with the mould in his hand—he said in the prisoner s presence that he had found it under the grate—I assisted Goose to search the room and under the bed near the fire-place I found a pipkin with white metal adhering to the side of it add the bottom and a piece of white metal on the mantel piece—that was all I found—when the prisoner stated to Goose that a man left them there I said it was curious he should place the mould under the fire-place if a man had left them—he replied that the man who left them desired him to take great care of them—I saw Clifton take from the prisoner s pocket a sixpence and I saw what dropped from the prisoner which turned out to be two base sixpences and three shillings—Clifton took them up—I said Do you say the money was left by the man as well as the mould How came they in your pocket —he said I agreed to go out with the man in the evening Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Were you three policemen together when you first went to the door of his room A Yes—Goose knocked at the door and it was opened by the prisoner or Goose—the prisoner was at the door in an instant—so time could have elapsed between the knocking and the opening for him to hide the things Q Was the metal the kind of metal soldiers use to fasten their flints in the gun lock A I should say they use a coarser sort of metal—the prisoner had not said he had put the mould in the fire-place but it was found there WILLIAM CLIFTON On the 16th of October I accompanied the witnesses and searched the prisoner—I found in the right hand pocket of his trowsers two sixpences and three shillings dropped from his person at the same time on the floor—I afterwards found a tin band in the room and a piece of carpeting with some white metal on it in different places and some plaster of Paris on it—the carpet was opposite the fire-place Cross-examined Q Are you quite sure it was plaster of Paris on the carpet A It appears to be so JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin for His Majesty s Mint This is a plaster of Paris mould intended for casting shillings and sixpences—it has the impression of both on each one part having the obverse and the other the reverse sides—it is a perfect mould and I have every reason to believe it has been used—there are particles of metal in the channel of the mould and discoloration from the heat of the metal—here are three shillings all counterfeit and I have no doubt they were produced from the mould produced—the three sixpences are also counterfeit and I believe were cast in this mould also—this tin band I believe has been used to form the plaster of Paris mould—it has that appearance—it confines the plaster of Paris in a fluid state—this iron spoon has white metal about it similar to the coin—it appears to have been used to lade the metal into the mould—this file would be used to remove some of the surface of the metal—here are small particles of white metal on the carpet—I have not a doubt the things produced are used to counterfeit coin—she mould itself has been made with good coin Prisoner s Defence The metal and things are used to cast leads for flints of my gun—the plaster of Paris was left by a man who was repairing my room previous to this—the file a great many soldiers have to brighten the swivel their sling goes through Peter Ridley sergeant in the Foot Guards to which the prisoner belonged deposed to his good character GUILTY Aged 24 — Transported for Seven Years Before Mr Baron Bolland

obverse sides of three sixpences MESSRS ELLIS and GURNEY conducted the Prosecution JOSEPH FRYER police-serjeant G 13 On the 18th of December I went to Well-and-Bucket-court Old-street—I went to a room on the ground floor—the street door was partly open—the room door was shut—I lifted the latch went in and saw the female prisoner sitting on the bedstead blowing the fire—the man was in bed with two children—I seized the female prisoner—she gave a loud shriek and wanted to know what I wanted there—I gave her to Reynolds another officer who followed me in—I then commenced searching a cupboard and took from it two bags one containing Roman cement and the other plaster-of-Paris—I gave them to Reynolds—I found a tobacco-pipe with some white metal in it—I saw Duke find some gets—I then went to another cupboard and at that moment the female prisoner swung across the bed—Reynolds took hold of her and pulled her back and stopped her from coming any further—she had come to where I was standing—she said I cannot help what my husband will do—Oh my poor babies what will become of your father and mother —I then took from the wall a bag which was hanging up full of old rags—I chucked it on the bed and told Reynolds to search it—in that bag was another smaller one and in that this mould—in a butter flat under the bed I found twenty-seven counterfeit shillings and twelve counterfeit sixpences which I have here—I saw Ash take from the same flat two good shillings and a good half-crown Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q At the time this woman made that exclamation there were two or three officers in the room A Yes there were five of us—two of them had handcuffed the man in bed—he is not a very large man but these things are destroyed in a moment—I know two men named Davis—one of them keeps a public-house the other is a constable of Clerkenwell parish—I am not aware that I know any other person of that name—I might have seen them the Davis before I went to the prisoners but I will swear I had no conversation with them respecting this man—I know Harris a publican—I have not seen him for six or seven months—I do not know any other person of that name—I was directed by the

by the side of the bed—I pulled her back and gave her to Hall and Fryer pulled down this bag and threw it on the bed—I found in it a small bag containing a plaster-of-Paris mould—the female prisoner said Oh my poor children you will never see your father and mother any more and that she could not help what her husband had done—I then received from Duke who was searching the cupboard a small pipkin and a pipe containing some white metal and a bag of plaster-of-Paris—here is a small piece of tin found in the cupboard by Ashton and another bag with some cement in it—on the mantel-piece under an image was a counterfeit half-crown which I delivered to Ashton—the male prisoner said You have no occasion to look at it cannot you tell whether it is bad or good Cross-examined Q When did you first receive directions to go to that place A The same morning—it was about nine o clock when we went there WILLIAM BAKER ASHTON police-serjeant G 11 I went with the other officers—I searched the butter-flat and found a tin box containing two good shillings and one good half-crown—I saw this half-crown found on the mantel-piece by Reynolds—I saw Duke take a little bowl from the cupboard—after the prisoners had been taken to the station-house I returned to the premises about eleven o clock with Reynolds—I made a further search and under the stairs under a deal of rubbish I found these pieces of plaster-of-Paris Cross-examined Q Some time had elapsed before you went back A Yes I should think an hour and a half or more—the other officers called on me that morning and told me they were ready to go ROBERT DUKE I am an officer of Hatton-garden I accompanied the other officers—I saw the woman in custody of Reynolds and Hall—the man was lying in bed—in a moment or two he jumped but of the bed and attempted to come near where I was standing near a cupboard in one corner of the room—I immediately handcuffed him and put him to the other side of the room—I searched the cupboard and found in one corner some pieces of white metal which are called gets in a cocoa-nut shell—in another corner I found a pipkin with some metal in it—I handed it to Reynolds to take care of—I took Russell in charge Cross-examined Q The other officers were there when you were A Yes they saw what transpired—the man jumped up and while he was up I handcuffed him—it is not true that I handcuffed him in bed—there were five of us there—each of us brought something—it was not particularly to give us something to do—the outer door was open when I got there and the inner door on the latch—I saw a man named Davis at our office yesterday—he is a constable—I had not seen him the day I went to the prisoner s nor the day before—I had no conversation with any man named Davis about this matter either before nor since—I do not know any man named Harris and have had no conversation with any man of that name—I went by desire of Hall my brother officer who spoke to me that morning between seven and eight o clock WILLIAM HALL I am an officer I went with the other officers—I saw Fryer take down a bag and throw it on the bed—Reynolds took this little bag out of it and in it was this mould—I took charge of the female prisoner—I saw the other officers search the place—I took this mould from Reynolds—this file was found in a little box on a table with some tape and thread in it Cross-examined Q You gave direction to Reynolds and Ashton A Yes I received directions on the Monday and I think we went on the Thursday—I know a constable named Davis—I do not recollect that I had seen him that Monday he is called Harlequin Davis —there is another Davis a publican on Saffron-hill—I had no talk with either of them about this matter—I had no conversation with a man named Harris—I received instructions from the officers of the Mint on Monday and acted upon them JOHN STANLEY I am an oil-man and live in Mile-end-road The house No 6 Well-and-Bucket-court is mine—the female prisoner hired part of it of my daughter a year and ten months ago—I received two shillings a week rent from her—the last I received was the week before this happened—they both lived there to the best of my knowledge but she has paid—he was represented to me as being in the watch business Cross-examined Q Did you ever see the man there A Certainly in the same apartment JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint This is a plaster-of-Faris mould for the purpose of casting sixpences—there are upon it the impressions of three sixpences—both the obverse and reverse sides of them—it is a mould in which sixpences may be cast and I think has been used for casting them—by closing one on the other they will form three sixpences—there is a channel down which the metal is poured in a state of fusion—the metal is easily melted in a pipkin like this and laded out with a pipe—this pipe has some metal in the tube of it now—it is a mixture of tin and antimony—these twelve sixpences are all counterfeit and I believe have been cast in this mould—this file is used to remove the small spray from the coins when made—these pieces of metal are called gets they came out of the mould produced—I have tried them to it and they fit exactly—they are removed with a pair of scissors or a file—this Roman cement is not used in coining that I am aware of—here are twenty-seven counterfeit shillings and two good ones which appear to me to have been used to make a mould in which the bad shillings have been made—this half-crown is counterfeit the other is good Isaac Russell s Defence When they came they seized hold of me and put the handcuffs on me in bed—they asked me to get up and took me to the other side of the room placed me against the window and ransacked my place all over—the night before about seven o clock or half-past seven my wife went to get something for supper and two young men named Harris and Davis called and asked me if they could leave these two bags there I said Yes —I went to the yard to wash myself and when I came in I put on my coat and handkerchief and said I was going out—they said Put these bags away —I said they could put them away—they put them

conducted the Prosecution RICHARD TRIPP policeman T 161 On Tuesday the 20th of January in consequence of information which I received about half-past five o clock in the evening I proceeded to Pearl-court Church-street St Giles with Matthews and Denton my brother constables—there are two rooms in the house one at the bottom and one at the top—I found the outer door open—I proceeded up stairs and found the room door closed—I put my shoulder against it and forced it open—I found a chair had been placed behind it to keep it close—I did not notice but I have no doubt it was on the latch—it required the weight of my body to get it open—I saw the two prisoners standing close to the fire-place—there was a large clear coke fire—my attention was then called away by a dog attacking me from under the bed—I beat it off with my staff—I turned round then and my brother officers had secured the prisoners—Flynn said What do you want here what is it you want —I told her she knew what we wanted as well as I did myself—she replied Thank God you have not seen us do any thing you cannot hang us —I commenced searching and while I was searching Hamlet said Thank God you cannot hang us you saw us doing nothing —I searched on the hearth near the fender and found a mould—it was closed—I took it up and found it was warm—I opened it and found a base shilling in it quite hot having been recently coined—I gave the mould to Matthews with the shilling in it in the state I found it—on searching further in the ashes I picked up four more base shillings and two iron spoons—on the hearth were some bits of metal apparently recently melted—I gave them to Matthews—on the shelf I found a paper bag of plaster of Paris—I gave that to Matthews—I told the prisoners to prepare themselves to go with me—Hamlet said Am I to go I have done nothing —Flynn replied You know you must go—and all that is found in the room —I then left Denton in charge of the room—Matthews and I took the prisoners to Bow-street—I returned in about a quarter of an hour by myself and found Denton still there—on searching more minutely on the hearth of the fire-place I found a small file which I produce—Denton found a shilling on the coke within the fire-grate on the fire—it was on a piece of coke on the top of the fire which was not burnt—we left the room and gave the shilling to Matthews at Bow-street—I saw nothing of Flynn s husband—he has been transported—her two children were in the room one is about eight and the other about four years old Flynn There is neither latch bolt nor lock to the door Witness I thought it was on the latch but I cannot gay whether there was a latch—there was a clear coke fire BENJAMIN WILLIAM MATTHEWS I accompanied Tripp and Denton If entered the room close behind Tripp—he was assailed by a large white-dog on entering the room—while he was beating it off I secured Flynn and Denton the other prisoner—I was by the side of Tripp and saw him find the mould and other things which I produce—he put them into my hand as he picked them up—here is a mould with a shilling in it—both the mould and shilling were hot—I saw him find three other shillings inside the fire-place within the fender—here are some pieces of metal which he gave me but I did not see him find them—I produce a bag of plaster of Paris which he found on the mantel-piece and another shilling which he afterwards gave me—I produce two iron spoons which I saw him find inside the fire-place JOHN DENTON I am a policeman I have been present and heard what the witnesses have stated—I confirm their evidence—I saw the whole transaction—I remained in the room—while Matthews was absent I found a shilling on a piece of unbornt coke in the back of the gate—there was a large coke fire JOHN FIELD I am Inspector to the Mint and have been so twenty-years This is a plaster of Paris mould—it has the impression of both the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling—the impressions are quite perfect—there is a shilling in the mould now—here is the get which fills the channel to the mould—it is attached to the shilling—it fits the mould—it was cast in this mould clearly—the mould and shilling correspond in all respects—the shilling has the impression of the obverse and reverse sides—the mould has been used for some time apparently for it is cracked and the appear-ances of the cracks are on the shilling—these spoons appear to have been used to melt metal—one spoon fits the mouth of the mould exactly—it is pinched up in a peculiar way to fit it—the other five shillings have been all cast in that mould I have not a doubt—these pieces of metal appear to have been spilt from the mould—a coke fire would answer the purpose of coining—it is Britannia metal which is a mixture of tin and antimony—here is a bag of plaster of Paris—a file is necessary to remove the surplus metal round the edge of the shilling—I find here every thing necessary for the purpose Flynn put in a written defence stating that she occupied the room with another woman—that she had gone out just before the officers arrived during which time the articles must have been placed there by some person

t18350511-1288  1288 ROBERT BANTIN and JOHN SHIELDS were indicted for that they on the 28th of April 1 mould upon which was impressed the figure and apparent resemblance of the obverse side of the King s current silver coin called a Shilling knowingly and without lawful excuse feloniously had in their custody and possession —2nd COUNT stating it to be the impresssion of the reverse side of a Shilling HON MR SCARLETT and MR ELLIS conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM FORD I am a policeman On Tuesday night the 28th of April between twelve and one o clock I went to No 16 Union-court Orchard-street Westminster—I saw a light in the parlour and suspecting something was going on I went through the passage of the next house on to the wall which is about four feet high the window is about five feet from the ground—I stepped from that wall on to another wall about a yard from the window—there was an old gown hung about half-way up the window—I could see from there what took place in the room—I could see over three-parts of the room—I saw Bantin with a plate and a tin band in his hand and a shilling on the plate—I heard Bantin say to a girl who was lying in bed What is this tied in such a d—d knot for —he took a knife from the mantel-piece and cut a string off the tin band and tied it afresh with another string—he placed the band on the plate over the shilling and I saw him take something white out of a cup and pour it into the band on the shilling—I communicated this to Banister my inspector at three o clock in the morning—I went to the house again the same morning at near ten o clock with Banister and Goose a policeman—we went to the front-door in the court which was bolted with one bolton the top—Banister and I forced the door—the bolt gave way and it flew open—we went into the passage and found the parlour-door fastened with a small bolt in the middle—the door broke asunder in the middle—the whole half of the door went in and I could see what was in the parlour—I saw Bantin stooping with the mould in his left-hand and a tobacco-pipe in his righthand—he was pouring something from a tobacco-pipe into the mould—he was holding the mould in his hand in a piece of rag—the whole door went in entirely in a moment and he then looked round over his shoulder and saw me—he then dropped the tobacco-pipe—he then took the mould out of the rag and broke it in pieces—he was going to rub it but part of the metal came into his hand which was hot and he dropped it—I caught it but could not hold it and was obliged to let it fall—Banister forced him back on the bed—I kept the piece of the mould in my hand and took this piece of spoon off the hob it is the handle—I have part of a shilling which was in the mould that is the hot metal which I spoke of—Bantin said when Banister was keeping him back Ah Ford you may pick it up that will of be no use to you —he said Good luck to the little bolt he has saved me this time —I heard him say the same to Banister and Goose again SAMUEL BANISTER I went with Ford and Goose to Union-court—the first thing I saw on entering the room was the prisoner Bantin in a stooping position as described by Ford with something in his left hand which he appeared to be crushing—he put it from one hand to the other and tried to crumble it—he dropped it on the floor and while he was in the act of stamping on it I knocked him backwards on the bed—at the time he had the mould in his left hand he put something in the fire with his right hand and partially upset a pipkin which was on a strong fire with white metal in it in a state of fusion—I attempted to take the pipkin away but it was so very hot I could not succeed at that moment—I afterwards saw Goose take it into his possession—I likewise saw Ford pick up the piece of mould and the piece of white metal which I believe to be part of a counterfeit shilling—on searching the room further I found a file on the mantle-piece with white metal in the teeth of it and an iron spoon on a shelf in the corner of the room—a short distance from the fire I found a box of plaster of Paris—I saw Goose find a tin band and a new white metal spoon—I secured Bantin and Goose arrested Shields who was in the room smoking a pipe when we went in—there was a female in the bed in the corner of the room in a complete state of nudity—she jumped up in her fright and had not even a shift on—Bantin said You have been looking after me a long time but it is no pull this time —I also heard him say Good luck to the little bolt it has saved me this time ROBERT GOOSE I am a policeman I accompanied Banister and Ford—I found 4d on Bantin—I took possession of a pipkin which was on the fire with white metal in it in a liquid state—on the hob was a new metal spoon—on the mantle-shelf a tin band with plaster of Paris round the inside of it—Bantin said we had been after him a good while but it was no pull this time JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to His Majesty s Mint and have been so some time Here are some pieces of what appear to be part of a plaster of Paris mould for casting shillings they are broken—I have put them together on this card—two pieces have parts of the impression of the obverse side of a shilling—there is very clearly the D and G and this piece of white metal which is said to have fallen from the mould has also that impression on it and there is also in the part of the mould a portion of the beading—here is some plaster of Paris in a box the mould is made of a similar material—it must be mixed with water in order to form that mould—it is generally enclosed in the tin band and then hardened—the process described by Ford is the process usually adopted to form a mould—this piece of a counterfeit shilling is made of white metal of a similar description to the metal spoon—this metal fuses at a very low heat—a file is used to remove any surplus metal round the coin after it is cast and this file has white metal in the teeth of it—the pieee of shilling is the same description of metal as was in the pipkin and the broken spoon is the same metal—it is Britannia metal Bantin s Defence As to Ford s seeing me at half-past one o clock at night I was never in the house until two o clock that night—he said he broke the street-door open and it was bolted at the top and after he broke the parlour-door open he saw me pouring metal out is it likely I should stay there doing that when I heard the street door opened WILLIAM FORD re-examined The street-door is very near the parlour-door—he told us he did not take any notice of the front door opening as he thought it was some chaps larking BANTIN— GUILTY Aged 20 — Transported for Life SHIELDS— NOT GUILTY Before Mr Justice Park

got up to him—I called to the man at the gate to stop him but he did not go on the bridge but into a stack of osiers—I found him concealed in the stack—I found this basket at the entrance of the osiers close to the road—it was between two bundles of osiers—I found in the basket a pair of stockings and a loaf it was about ten yards from him—I asked him if he had bought a pair of stockings at Miss Cable s—he said he had—I said he must go with me to Miss Cable s and he came with me—he said Don t handle me —he said he dare say if he gave the change back it would be all right—I did not tell him it would be better or worse for him to confess—I took him to Miss Cable s shop with the basket—he said the basket and its contents were his—Miss Cable recognized him directly and gave me this piece of coin—I have had the care of it ever since—I searched the prisoner at the watch-house and found a five-shilling-piece and 9s 6d on him all good money—all I noticed that night as the

heard I examined the crown-piece and thought it was a bad one—I showed it to my daughter—I had it in my hand—I then put it into a drawer by itself—the desk which the drawer was inside of was locked every night—I put it into the drawer about ten o clock in the morning I never meddled with it afterwards—on the 18th of April I directed my daughter to go to the drawer and she bought me a crown-piece—the desk was not locked during the day—it was accessible to my daughter during the day but to nobody else—it is in the parlour adjoining my shop—I have no other children at home—I have servants they have no business at my drawer—the crown-piece my daughter gave me was a bad one and the one I had taken on the 11th this was the Saturday following—I did not see it between that and the

t18350921-2111  2111 JOHN JONES MARY the wife of William JONES and JAMES GLADWIN were indicted for that they on the 11th of September falsely made and counterfeited 3 pieces of counterfeit coin resembling and apparently intended to resemble half-crowns MR ELLIS conducted the Prosecution JAMES FOGG I am a Thames-police officer On the 11th of September I was at the prisoner Jones s hoiuse in Propect-place East-lane Walworth Mitchell Isbester and two other officers were with me—It was about half-past four o clock in the afternoon—Mitchell went to the front door I went to the back door and when I heard a knock at the front door which we had agreed upon I opened the back door went in and found the three prisoners in the lower room—the door was on the latch—I saw the female prisoner throw something on the fire and put the kettle on immediately and run out at the back door but she was afterwards bought back—Jones was sitting with his back to the window close to the fire and a table on the left-hand side of him—I ran to the table and saw a counterfeit half-crown on it—there was a fine clear fire—I took up the half-crown on the table and it was quite hot—I secured his left hand and it was full of half-crowns—at that time Mitchellk had got in at the frount door—I gave Mitchell the half-crowns and some of them were warm—I then secured his right hand and from that I took nineteen half-crowns which were not warm—I handcuffed him and gave him to one of the officers to take care of—I went toward the fire and Mitchell called me and said Look here Fogg before I disturb this—there was half-a-crown mould in the fire and the impression on it—It is plaster of Paris—It was the woman side of the impression—the reverse side—after that Mitchell took them out of the fire and put them on the hob—while he was blowing his fingers as it was hot Jones put his foot upon the hob and smashed the mould—I then Left Mitchell and went to a chest of drawers in the room—I there found a stocking with several counterfeit half-crowns in it which I gave to Mitchell—both the Jones hands were black—such a blackness as would result from handling coin—I produce nineteen of the half-crowns which I put in my pocket—I took them out of Jones s hands Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q If I understand you rightly the three prisoners were in the room A Yes I think Gladwin was sitting down in the room—he had his hat and a great coat on Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Had you reason to know that the two Jones were man and wife A No I have not made inquiries about them—I do not know whether the officers of the Mint have—there are two rooms in the house—six of us went there—I think there were not seven—I and Mitchell had been at the Masons s Arms public-house before we went there—the other four officers were at another house in the Walworth-road—there was another person with us at the public-house—he went on his own business—he is a gentleman—I do not think I have a right to answer what he is he is a respectable tradesman WILLIAM ISBESTER I am in the Thames police I was with the last witness on the occasion—I went first to a house nearly opposite the prisoner s and I saw from the first floor landing window the prisoner John Jones come to the window with his coat off his shirt sleeves tucked up and holding in his right hand something white which I believe to be a mould—he went away for a few moments and returned again holding something in his hand which I believe to be a whole mould—he was looking towards the end of it the top—the female prisoner was in the room at the same time sitting in the window doing something by the motion of her hand but what I cannot say as a curtain went across the window she was without her gown—this was between eleven and twelve o clock—and between twelve and one o clock the same day I saw John Jones come out of the house—he was gone about ten minutes and then returned with the prisoner Gladwin they both went into the house stopped in ten or fifteen minutes and came out again—Gladwin John Jones and an old woman a child and the female prisoner all came out—Jones and Gladwin came out first and the others followed and shut the door—I came out of the house where I was and saw them part—Gladwin went up a street and John Jones went a-head and his wife followed him—this was all on Tuesday the 8th between eleven and one o clock Q State what happened on the 11th A On the Friday following I went with Fogg Mitchell and the other officer—I got over some palings about half-past four in the afternoon and went to the back door of the house with Fogg and another officer—Fogg stopped at the door a few moments with his finger on the latch and when he heard a knock at the front door—he opended the door—I followed and went through the room to the door—I unbolted the front door which was bolted at the top and let Mitchell in and went into the room again with him—I have heard what Fogg has said and agree with it as far as I was present after the prisoners were secured on the table next to where John Jones sat I found a small file and in a cupboard next to where he sat on the lower shelf I found two paper bags containing I believe plaster of Paris and a small paper of what I call fine sand but I believe it turns out to be linseed meal the female prisoner calls it linseed-meal and something else with it and I found in the same cupboard two tin bands ALEXANDER MITCHELL I am a Thames police-constable I was with the party—Isbester was acting under my orders on the 8th—on the 11th I went to the front door—Isbester let me in—I saw the two prisoners Jones and Gladwin—Fogg had got hold of Jones s hand and he handed me some counterfiet half-crowns which I produce—after the prisoners were secured I went to the fire took off a tea-kettle and saw some parts of a mould on the fire—one of them lying at the back part and the half of a mould with the reverse side of a half-crown impressed on it—before I disturbed it I called Fogg to look at it—as I took it out of the fire it broke and with the tongs and my fingers I took all I could see out of the fire and placed it on the hob—my fingers were burnt and while I was blowing my fingers John Jones came behind me—he made either a kick or a bolw with his foot on the hob and smashed the pieces of the mould more than they were before—I afterwards received from Fogg six crowns and eight half-crowns in a stocking they are counterfeit—I searched the ashes and found an iron ladle with the appearance of white lead in it—on the top of a cupboard or dresser I found the half of half-a-crown and one metal spoon—on the table by Jones I found five other white spoons—I asked Jones who the house belonged to—he said I took it and pointed to Gladwin he said That old man has nothing to do with it—he knows nothing of my business or what I do —I afterwards took the moulds to Mr Powell the solocitor and in my presence they put them together as they are now JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to the Mint and have been so nearly twenty years—I have examined all the nineteen half-crown produced by Fogg they are all counterfeit—those nineteen produced by Mitchell are all counterfeit—and the six crowns produced by Mitchell are all counterfeit—the half-crowns are from two different moulds of the date of 1821 and 1825 in the reigb of George the Fourth—here are eight more half-crowns and a plaster of Paris mould on one side of which here is part of the impression of the obverse side of a half-crown and on the other a very small portion of the reverse of the reign of George the Fourth 1825 which is the date of some of the half-crowns—this mould does not appear to me to have been used for castint—here is another plaster of Paris mould for half-crowns—that is broken also but there are portions of the impressions of the obverse and reverse sides of a half-crown of 1825 it has nearly the entire impression of the reverse side this appears to have been used considerably and I believe some of the half-crowns produced have been cast on this mould for I find some corresponding indentures in the plaster which correspond with some of the half-crowns—here is another mouls for half-crowns also which appears to be of the date of 1821 the figures are not complete but here is the 2 and 1 and a portion of the 8 and the type corresponds with the impression of that year—here are two tin bands such as are usually made use of for forming plaster of Paris moulds and I believe these moulds have been formed in these bands—these white metal spoons are similar metal to the half-crowns and that is the usual way coiners provide metal—here is plaster of Paris in powder in the bag and a file which is necessary to round off the edge of the coin—I do not know what this sand is used for MRS KNIGHT I am the wife of Richard Knight who is owner of this house It was taken from me in August by Jones and his wife—I do not know the woman to be his wife—Gladwin was with them and seemed to think it sould suit them very well—he did not do any thing himself—Mrs Jones always paid the rent Cross-examined Q How long have you known them A Since August—they appeared man and wife and I thought they were so John Jones s Defence I am entirely innocent of making bad money—I admit they were in my possession Mary Jones I am the wife of John Jones We were married at Carlow seven years ago on the 10th of last March JOHN JONES— GUILTY Aged 30 — Transported for Life MARY JONES— NOT GUILTY GLADWIN— NOT GUILTY There was another indictment against the prisoners for having in their possession a mould on which was impressed the figure of a half-crown on which no eveidence was offered NOT GUILTY Before Mr Baron Gurney

deceitfully and feloniously utter and put off to one William James Robert Savage 1 false and counterfeit shilling well knowing the same to be false and counterfeit MR ELLIS conducted the Prosecution EDWARD JOSEPH POWELL I am one of the under solicitors of the Mint I produce a copy of the record of the conviction of Robert Johnson at Maidstone in October session 1832—I have examined it with the record at the office of the Clerk of the Peace—one read the record and I examined the copy and then I examined the copy against the record read —I was present at the trial—the prisoner is the person who was convicted—I was a witness in the case WILLIAM JAMES ROBERT SAVAGE I am clerk to a gentleman My father is clerk to a gentleman in the Temple and lives in Portugal-street—he carries on the business of a pastrycook there—on the 1st of October I saw the prisoner at my father s shop between six and seven o clock—he asked for two Abernethy biscuits which I served him with—he gave me a shilling—I took it into the parlour and gave him 10d in change—I gave the shilling to my father to look at and he returned it to me—it was not out of my sight till I gave it to my mother Prisoner Q You swear I am the man A Yes WILLIAM SAVAGE I took a shilling from my son and told him it was had—I returned it to him CLARISSA SAVAGE I am the wife of the last witness I received a shilling from my son and put it into a bag loose—there was another shilling in the bag—next morning I took the shilling out of the bag and wrapped it in paper—I knew it to be a bad one and know it was the one my son gave me for I had not another bad one there—I will swear it—I had several shillings there but not a bad one—I wrapped it in paper the next morning after it had been mixed with the other shillings—I know the others were all good because I never had any of them refused—I knew this to be bad when my son gave it to me before I put it in the bag—I looked all the shillings over next morning and have not a doubt this is the one my son gave me COURT Q Is it not possible that some of the others might be bad A I cannot say but none of them were refused—I gave the shilling to the police-officer—it was the only bad one I found there PHILIP WEBSTER I am a policeman On the 2nd of October I was in Gloster-street about ten o clock—I saw the prisoner in company with another man—they turned down Marylebone-lane—the prisoner ran down the Mews the other man went another way—I followed the prisoner and saw him go into a public-house and wait there about two minutes—it was kept by Escot—I afterwards saw him come out—I went into Oxford-street and saw him and the other man join together again and go up Oxford-street conversing together—they parted and the prisoner went down Shepherd-street I followed him—he turned round to the left into Hanover-square and stood at the corner with his back against the railing—I went up and collared him—I said You are my prisoner —he said Why —I said I will tell you presently —I searched him in the street with the assistance of a running dustman—I searched his right-hand pocket and found two counterfeit half-crowns—I asked him how he accounted for the possession of them—he said I do not know I did not know I had them in my pocket till you found them —I said That is singular what is your name —he said Walter —I said Have you not another name —he said Ashford —I said Have you no account to give of the two half-crowns —he said Why yes I must have been foolish I must have known how I came by them I found them — When said I— Yesterday said he—I took him to the station-house and left him in custody and went to Escot s and on the 3rd I went to Mrs Savage who gave me the shilling—I marked it in her presence WILLIAM SAVAGE re-examined When I got the shilling from my son I looked at it and felt it—I said it was bad immediately—I have not a doubt of it—I cannot say it was the same as my wife took from the bag WILLIAM JAMES R SAVAGE re-examined Directly the prisoner left the shop I looked at the shilling and told my father I thought it was bad—I looked at it attentively ELIZABETH ESCOT I am the wife of Robert Escot a publican in James-street On the 2nd of October the prisoner came to the bar and asked for a glass of gin—I poured it out and put it on the counter—I have not the least doubt of him—it came to twopence—he gave me half-a-crown—I took it up and told him I thought it was a bad one—he said I wish we had many of them —I said I should not take it—he said he had no more money and took the half-crown away JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to the Mint This is a counterfeit shilling—these two half-crowns are both counterfeits and are both cast in the same mould Prisoner s Defence I was sleeping the night previous with a man named Green whom I had not seen for some time before—I have every reason to believe he put the half-crowns into my pocket but I did not know I had them at the time I was taken—I believe I was trepanned into the affair—I acknowledge the former conviction—since that I have got my living in an honourable way James Beverley tailor Adam-street Manchester-square

t18351026-2286  2286 THOMAS FIELD alias Jenkins FREDERICK THOMAS JENKINS alias Edwards SOPHIA JENKINS alias Sophia Edwards and MARY CARMAN alias Lindsay were indicted for feloniously making and counterfeiting 4 pieces of false and counterfeit coin resembling and apparently intended to resemble and pass for crown-pieces on the 19th of September at St Mary Lambeth MR CHAMBERS conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM REYNOLDS I am a constable of St James s Clerkenwell On the 19th of September I went to New-street New-cut LambethDuke Hall and Ashton were with me—I arrived a little before four o clock in the afternoon and observed a female knocking at the door of No 1—the door was opened by Carman—I rushed into the passage and was collared by Carman who screamed out violently—Duke followed me in immediately—I released myself from Carman and went up staris and in going up I had occasion to pass by the back parlour door—I observed the prisoner Jenkins called Thomas Field in the back parlour in his shirt sleeves and at the top of the staris was Sophia Jenkins who had nothing on but her shift—she said My God what is the matter —she went into the bacje room first floor on to a bed which was lying on the floor and wrapped a blanket round her—I went into the front room first floor and seeing no one there I ran down stairs hearing a noise in the back yard—I met Ashton as I was coming down the stairs and we both ran into the yard together—I found Carman in the yard then and nobody else—I saw two crown pieces lying on the stones in the yard and two in the water-tub—I requested Ashton to pick them up which he did and in a small drain near the water-butt having a little clear water in it I observed through the water a crown-pieco—I put my arm down the drain and took it up—this is it—I then went into the back parlour and found Hall and Duke and the two male prisoners Field and the boy Jenkins —on a chair in the room I found a small file containing white metal in the teeth also a paper band with a small portion of plaster of Paris on it—Duke in my presence proceeded to search the room and while he was doing so the boy F T Jenkins was very violent screaming out Murder dreadfully—Field was standing in one corner of the room with his hancuffs on him—while Duke was searching the female prisoner Sophia Jenkins put her hand in through the window which was open and seized hold of something which Duke had laid down on the chair—Duke laid hold of her hand and endeavoured to get it from her but did not succeed—at that moment Field sprang from the corner at which he was standing and seized at Duke with the handcuffs on—that prevented Duke from getting hold of what Sophia Jenkins had—I laid hold of Field by his hand and pulled him back and afterwards took away Field and the boy Jenkins in a coach which I had waiting Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When Carman opened the door did you say any thing to her A I did not—I did not inquire for any body—I rushed in immediately and was followed by a brother officer and by more than one—I did not hear either of them say a word before they rushed in—the water-tub stood about half-a-foot from the ground—there were five or six pails of water in it—the officers were rushing into the room when the boy screamed Murder —Sophia Jenkins was not in a situation to have any thing to do with what was going on in the room—one of the officers was struggling with Sophia Jenkins when Field sprand from the corner of the room with his handcuffs on—he was not using violence towards her—he had got hold of her hand—I do not call it violence—she put her hand through the window to take what she did and he laid hold of her hand—he used no more violence that was necessary—I know of no connexion between Field and Sophia Jenkins—I saw Field in the passage in his shirt sleeves—I did not see him do any act of coining—he had not the opportunity while the officers were there—his standing in his shirt sleeves and interfering in defence of the woman were the on ly things I saw him do MR CHAMBERS Q It was after Carman had screamed out at the door that you saw him A Yes there were no other persons in the house but the four prisoners WILLIAM BAKER ASHTON I am a police-segeant I went on the 19th of September in company with Duke Hall and Reynolds to No 1 New Cut Lambeth—I arrived there about a quarter to four o clock—I saw the door of the house opened—Reynolds went in first—Duke and I pushed in together and Reynolds was in the passage with Carman—I pushed by him and saw a man with his coat off endevouring to get over the wall in the yard—that was Field—I heard something like money falling—there was nobody else in the yard—Duke and I prevented his getting over the wall I—afterwards looked about the yard and found two crown-pieces lying on the pavement in the yard and these two crown-pieces were in the water-butt close to where Field was endeavouring to get over the wall—I saw Reynolds take a crown-piece out of the drain—I afterwards looked over the wall being certain there was more money I got over the wall and found this bag with coin it it and some coins spread about the yard—I collected them all into the bag—there were 49 shillings 10 hals-crowns and 2 crown-pieces one of them unfinished—as I was taking the money up I heard a great noise next door and was desired to come and I ran round the adjoining house into No 1 to assist the officers—I went into the back parlour and Field was given into my custody—Hall and I took him in a coach—Hall brought the boy Jenkins to the coach and we took them both to Clerkenwell station-house—a man named Cooper went into the passage of No 1 with us—he staid there for a short time—when we were in the coach with Field the boy was crying and Field said Be a good boy and be quiet —I said Is he your boy —he said I shall answer no questions —I said he need not without h e liked—about a minute afterwards without saying amy more he said No it is not my boy I dare say you know that from where you got your information —I observed Field s left hand was very black in the coach as if he had been working at the fire and he kept rubbing it on his trowsers—I said You are taking a great deal of pains to get that stuff off your hands —he said What stuff I don t know what you mean Field It was the juice of an apple which the officer had given me Witness It was a quantity of black stuff of the back of his hand as if he had been holding it over the smoke Cross-examined Q What time of the day was this A I can t say to a few minutes—I should say about a quarter to four—the yard is about ten feet by five or six—I heard the sound of coin falling but did not see it fall—if a bag of coins had been thrown from up stairs and burat some of it might have fallen on each side the wall—the black markds were on the back of his fingers—Reynolds gave him an apple as he complained of being thirsty and wanted porter—I know nothing of two persons named Smith occupying an apartment in the house—the boy cried very much—I saw Carman in the yard afterwards—I rushed into the house very suddenly—it might have frightened her ROBERT DUKE I am a police-officer of Hatton-garden I went with the officers to the house in the New Cut—I went into the back parlour—I observed the boy Jenkins stamping violently on some white substance and I afterwards discovered it to be a piece of plaster of Paris mould—when I had got him in my arms he cried out Murder very violently—I afterwards found on the table in the room this wooden frame as it now is—it is used for the purpose of holding a mould—I also found a pair of scissors and a pair of plyers a file which appears to have been used for white metal and on the chair I found part of a spoon with the end melted and three new spoons in a paper as they now are—also a knife with a quantity of white plaster on it—and on the floor I picked up some pieces of plaster of Paris mould which I now produce—this metal get I picked up but it was so hot I was obliged to let it fall again—it is that part of the metal which fills the aperture or neck of the mould—on the shelf by the side of the fire-place I found a paper containing a quantity of counterfeit coin which I handed over to Hall—I also found a box on the same shelf containing eleven pieces of white metal and a good half-crown—I found on the mantel-piece a small spoon with some white substance about it and on another shelf two bags of plaster of Paris nearly full and two small files—I observed the fire it was very birght and this ladle was on it with this white metal in it in a fluid state—after taking up the pieces of mould from the floor I placed them on a chair near the window—the prisoner Sophia Jenkins was at that timein the yard and the window was open—she reached her arm in and took some of the pieces of mould off the chair and succeeded in destroying them which prevents my producing all the pieces I found on the floor—I took Sophia Jenkins to the station-house and on the road I said to her that her husband was engaged in a very dangerous business—she told me he could not help it that he was a smith by trade and he had been out of work a long time Cross-examined Q Where did that conversation take place A Going to the station-house in Rosoman-street—I believe she began the conversation herself—I found the get on the floor—I cannot tell how long the metal had been on the fire—I should think the fire would smoke his hand—I know of nobody else occupying part of the house—there was nobody else in the house at the time MR CHAMBERS Q Was the use of this ladle likely to make a hand black A Yes it is black enough now WILLIAM HALL I am an officer of Hatton-garden I went to this house with the other officers—I produce twenty-nine shillings two crown-pieces and one half-crown which were given me by Duke who took them out of a cupboard by the side of the fire-place JOHN FIELD I am Inspector of coin to the Mint This is a frame which might be used to bold moulds together—it is generally used for that purpose to hold the two parts firmly together—this is part of a plaster-ofParis mould for casting a crown-piece—there is a portion of the impression of the obverse side of a crown-piece on it now and three are some of the letters of the word Britannia—the channel of the mould through which metal is poured is still remaining and this get corresponds in size with the channel—this is the obverse side of a half-crown mould dated 1826 and it has some of the letters—here is a mould for a shilling with the obverse and reverse impressions nearly complete of the date of 1819—I have examined the other things they are all implements of coining and casting and such as are generally used—the crown-pieces are apparently intended to resemble the current coin—all the coin produced is counterfeit and is cast with white metal and this good half-crown appears to have been used to make the mould Cross-examined Q By what test do you ascertain them to be bad A The coin of the realm is struck with a die—these are cast in a mould and this is white metal WILLIAM REYNOLDS re-examined I first saw Field in the back parlour—it was before Ashton saw him JURY Q What was the nature of Carman s exclamation when you entered the house A She screamed out that is all—she resisted and struggled with me—she had no reason to know me that I am aware of Field s Defence In the first place—at Hatton-garden nothing was sworn about my being seen in the room below stairs till I was brought there by the officers—I was taken handcuffed from the yard to the room—I had called at the house twenty minutes before to visit Sophia Jenkins and stopped there as she was ill—I formerly lived with her—I slept there once or twice a week then—I had left her and came down stairs to go to the business of my master who is unable to attend here—I was taken and othere witnesses I might have had here may not come understanding the Mint cases would not be tried till Friday morning—my landlord would have been here had he due notice of the case—I will next observe that while in the water-closet the prisoner Jenkins who will acknowledge I was there and merely came to visit her —She heard there was something amiss and called to me to let me escape—I have surfered from something of this sort before—I declare I was never in eighter of the lower rooms—the landlord of the house was summoned to give evidence at the office and when called on he said he was the rent-gatherer and that only Smith and his wife had taken the house—they said Look round and see if you can see Smith —he looked round and said I do not see him —the Magistrate asked him to look at the prisoner if that was him—he said No I decidedly not it was a bigger man than him —he said Don t you think it possible that might be him —he said No —I said I beg your pardon your Worship I hope you don t want the man to swear to me —the Magistrate said Silence Sir pur your hat on don t interrupt the witness and I put my hat on but he could not identify me—I declare my innocence of having been in eighter of the lower rooms or having possession of the coin JOHN MARMOY I live at No 43 New York-street Bethnal-green The prisoner field lived in my house for 12 or 15 months as near as I can recollect—I do not know who he worked for—I remember this Saturday the 19th of September—he did not come home to dinner that day—I have known him longer than the time he lodged with me—he bore an honest character MR CHAMBERS Q When did the prisoner first come to lodge at your house A About 12 or 15 months since but I am not certain to a day as he always paid me every Saturday—I do not know how he got his livelihood only as a mechanic—he came in a mechanic s dress—I had heard he worked somewhere near whitechapel but where I never knew—I don t know any of his friends Prisoner Field Q Was not I at home to dinner on the Saturday in question Try and recollect yourself Witness Oh Yes he was at dinner on the Saturday but he did not come home that night—he dined at home about one o clock and left about ten minutes after two Field I went from the house of my landlord to my work at Whitechapel but I don t wish to bring the young man s name in the way who employed me as it might injure him—he is an upholsterer—I had gone over to Webber-row on business for him and visited Jenkins she being ill at the time—I laid down there which may account for my being in my shirt sleeves—I staid about a quarter of an hour with her and went down to the privy—a messenger had arrived from a house where Mr Powell knows an apprehension had taken place about an hour before and the policemen had to go to Rosoman-street with the prisoners they took and then came over the water to the New Cut during which time there were popportunities for parties to convey intelligence to Mr and Mrs Smith who could have made their escape and left the articles as they were found Jenkins s Defence These two young men are quite innocent—the landlord was not at home—I had two rooms on the first floor Field The officer struck the woman with his staff which made me go to her assistance ROBERT DUKE re-examined There was no staff used not one was taken out of any officer s pocket FIELD— GUILTY Aged 28 SOPHIA JENKINS— GUILTY Aged 29 Transported for

counterfeit coin The HON MR SCARLETT and MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution CALEB EDWARD POWELL I am assistant solicitor to the Mint I produce an examined copy of the record of the conviction of John Douglas in February 1835—I have examined it with the record—it is a true copy read ROBERT DOCURA I am a police constable I was present when the prisoner was tried in February 1835 and convicted of uttering a counterfeit crown-piece—I am sure he is the same man—I took him up ELIZABETH HUNTER I am niece to Mr Thomas Ballance who keeps the Red Lion in Ratchiff-highway On the 3rd of February the prisoner came there and asked for a glass of the best gin—he offered me a good half-crown in payment at first but then asked me for it back saying he thought he had got halfpence—I gave it him back and he put sixpence and two halfpence and a farthing on the counter—the copper was not enough to pay for the gin which was twopence—he took the sixpence and copper up off the counter and gave me a bed half-crown—I called to my uncle and gave it to him and told him he had given me a good half-crown at first and now he had given me a bad one—he afterwards paid me for the gin with a penny-piece and two halfpence—I gave the bad half-crown to my uncle—he did not give it back to the prisoner Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Did you observe which pocket he took the copper money from A No nor which he took the half-crown from—he gave me the bad one from his left hand—he put the good one on the counter and it remained there for about a minute or two—I did not ask him for the sixpence instead of the half-crown—I gave the half-crown to my uncle directly—it did not pass through any body s hands—my uncle did not see the sixpence—he was about half a yard from me—he could see what was going on if he was looking that way—I took the twopence for the gin THOMAS BALLANCE I was standing near Hunter when she served the prisoner with the gin—I observed what took place—she gave me a half-crown to look at—I found it was a bad one—I went round the counter and stopped the prisoner—she said This person has first given me a good half-crown and has now given me a bad one —I charged him with having passed bad money —he wanted to go out and said You do not suspect me of passing bad money —I closed the door and said If you will show me the good half-crown you showed the girl at first you shall go out —he said he had got nothing but the half-crown she had given me—I sent for a policeman—while my friend was gone for him the prisoner showed me the good half-crown in the palm of his right hand—he was then taken into custody—just as the officer was coming in he turned his back to me and put something into his mouth—he put his hand up to his mouth and appeared to have great difficulty to get something down his throat—what it was I did not see—I gave the bad half-crown to the officer Cross-examined Q When did you give it to the Officer A As soon as he came in—it passed from my niece s hand into mine and from mine into the officer s—I am sure he said he had no other half-crown—not that he had given the girl no other—he paid for the gin before the policeman came with one penny-piece and two halfpence—I did not see any thing of a sixpence WILLIAM ROCK police-constable H 99 I was on duty in Ratcliff-highway on the 3rd of February—I went to Mr Ballance s house about half-past four o clock

Statute &c MESSRS SCARLETT and ELLIS conducted the Prosecution ROBERT DUKE I belong to the Police Office Hatton-garden On the 15th of March I was in Church-street St Giles s in company with Hall Reynolds and Palmer all belonging to the police—I went to No 8 Church-street to the one pair of stairs room and found the door fastened—I was followed by Reynolds—we endeavoured to force the door and after some difficulty did so—I saw the female prisoner standing in the middle of the room and the male prisoner on the right hand side near the fire-place in his shirt sleeves—they were tucked up—I had heard the woman call out before I got in What do you want or something of the sort—previous to seeing the man I heard something rattle like money—it was just about the time that I forced the door open—the prisoner hands were very black—I took him away from the past where he stood near the fire-place—the fire was very brisk indeed—I proceeded after that to search the fire-place and observed a iron spoon in the fire red hot—on a chair very near the fire-place I found a metal spoon with the end of it partly melted off—on the table I found a pair of scissors and also a small piece of mental which had been melted—on the right hand hob of then hob of the fireplace I found two shilling and on the left hand bon one shilling—they were quite warm at the time I took them off the hob—the two are dated 1817 the other 1820—I afterwards proceeded to search the fire-place more particularly and up the chimney on a ledge on the right hand side as far as I could reach with my arm I found a mould for shillings which I handed over to Hall to take care of—I searched farther and on the same ledge of the chimney I found another mould for half-crowns which I produce—they are made of plaster-of-Paris WILLIAM REYNOLDS I am a constable I accompanied Duke to the prisoners lodging—I entered the room with him—the male prisoner was standing on the left hand side of the fire-place and the female in the middle of the room—I searched the room and in a cupboard by the left hand side of the fire-place on the floor I found some pieces of plaster of Paris mould I picked them up—they were quite warm at the time—in the same cupboard on a shelf In found half a bag of plaster-of-Paris—on searching up the chimney I found six counterfeit shilling and a sixpence—on the hob on the right hand side of the fire-place I found a counterfeit shilling and under the fire-place among the ashes I picked up two counterfeit shilling and some pieces of metal which had been melted—I observed that the male prisoners s hands were very dirty CHARLES PALMER I am a policeman I accompanied Duke Reynolds and Hall—what I entered the woman was standing in the middle of the room and the man near the fire—I immediately secured the prisoners while Duke and Reynolds searched the room—i saw Reynolds and a sixpenny-mould on the floor and several counterfeit coins on the hob—I afterwards searched up the chimney and found a half-crown mould and a shilling mould—the male prisoner had no coat on—his shirt sleeves were turned up WILLIAM HALL I went with the other officer—I waited outside while they went up stairs—I apprehended a man Young who jumped out of the window—he was discharged at Hatton-garden Office—when I entered the apartment I picked a sixpence off the floor which I produces—I saw Duke find a mould up the chimney JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to his Majesty s Mint and have been so nearly twenty years I have examined the articles produced—there are three plaster-of-Paris mould one for the casting of half-crowns one for a shilling and one for a sixpences—they all appear to have been used for the purpose of casting coin—the date of the sixpenny-mould is 1816—there are two counterfeit sixpences produced which correspond with that mould and I believe have been cast in it—they correspond in all respects with the mould—there are one or two trifling accidental marks on the coin of which I find corresponding ones on the mould which enables me to believe they have been cast in the mould—here is a mould for casting shillings the impression of which bears the date of 1820 and I find among twelve conterfeit shillings produced eight of them correspond with that mould in all respects—the half-crown mould has been used but there is no coin of that date—the coin is made of Britannia metal which is a mixture of tin and antimony and the spoon is of the same metal—here is an iron spoon which appears to have been on the fire and to have some white metal in it similar to the spoon—it is possible it might have been used for melting the white metal—this plaster-of-Paris is the material of which the mould are made—the scissors night be used to clip the superfluous metal John drew to R DUKE Q Did I make any resistance A No—the window was open when I got up—there were two bedsteads in the room—you were in your shirt sleeves John Drew s Defence I had been at work from six to one o clock and had not been in the room five minutes when I was going to change my linen—Young was sitting at the five—i took no notice of him—the officers came to the door—Young immediately jumped up and threw something out of his pocket towards the fire which sounded like silver he then ran to the window and jumped out—two officers secured him and brought him up—there were two beds in the room—Young occupied one—he had lodged three eight nights—I had known him a fortnight and had known his father a long time I gave him a lodging as he said he was going to work in a few days and his father would not give him a farthing—I know nothing of the implements found in her room—Young brought all into the place and then informed against me purposely to obtain money—did not take the room—it was my brother s apartment—Young has he same recourse to the room as we had and he different people there while I was at work—the officer says he heard money rattle before he entered—that was when Young threw the coins of his pocket—he was committed about six months before for a similar offence in the name of Waiter and I understand was tried last Session in the name of Young—do you think I should have placed the coin on each side of the fire and in these other places when the officer says there was a large fire if they were in my possession—I could have been them into the fire and they would leave melted immediately Jane drew s Defence On the morning of the 13th of March Young came into the place with a new spoon—I was washing at the time the officers came—I saw him at the fire but took no notice—I was certainly very much frightened when I heard the knocking at the door but when I got over my fright I unlocked the door—I heard something rattle when Young jumped out of the

moment and one of them I do not know which said Oh what do you want here —I took them into custody and put them in one corner of the room—Ashton look charge of them—the window was open and on the coping stone I found two pieces of metal which were hot at the time—I produce them—on searching the fire-place with Hall I found a piece of metal under the grate—Hall poked the fire with a small poker and I saw some metal run out of the fire—there was one piece of metal and a piece of cinder with metal on it—I found some part of the metal before he raked the fire—this piece was lying down and when he pocked the fire I saw more run out which he picked up—I did not pick up any after he poked the fire WILLIAM BAKER ASHTON I accompanied Reynolds—I entered the room almost immediately after him and saw him with the two prisoners at the further side of the room—Amelia was near the fire-place and Mary bear the window—Amelia was the furthest from me—I went towards her and she held out a shilling

shilling ROBERT DUKE I belong to the police-office of Hatton-garden I was with Reynolds and Ashton—I was in the street about a minute after they went in—there was just time for them to get up to the second floor—I observed the prisoner Mary at the window—she threw something out—it fell into the middle of the street in the dirt and mud—I immediately picked it up—it felt quite hot—I found it to be a mould for shillings—it was broken when it fell into several pieces—I have it here in a box and a shilling which was lying close to it quite hot—I did not see the shilling thrown out—the mould came out of the window in pieces—I saw it in pieces before it struck the ground—I went up-stairs and found on the table a small file with white metal in the teeth of it—and near the table I found two pieces of a metal spoon—it was a very brisk coke fire—under the fire-place I found an old iron spoon with white metal in it which is in it now—I searched Mary—she hesitated and requested I would get a woman to search her—but I ultimately put my hand through the pocket-hole of her gown and drew her pocket out—I found in it a counterfeit shilling in an unfinished state—I searched the other prisoner

sometimes the other JURY Q Was there no elder person visiting them to instruct them in this art A No—nobody that I saw JOHN FIELD I am Inspector of Coin to His Majesty s Mint and have been so nearly twenty years—the mould produced by the officer is made of plaster-of-Paris and is intended for casting counterfeit shillings and calculated for it—it has the impressions of both sides of a shilling on it and appears to have been used for such a purpose—I believe it has been used the obverse side is the deepest impression—the reverse is merely the surface—the two shillings produced by Duke are counterfeit—they are Britannia metal cast—I have applied one to the mould and it corresponds with it and I believe it was made by it—I have fitted both of them to the mould—they correspond in all respects—the piece of white metal produced by the officer and some which is adhering to the cinders is of a similar description of metal to the counterfeit shilling—this spoon is also of the same kind of metal—here is an iron spoon which has the same kind of white metal adhering to it—it appears to have been in the fire—I cannot tell whether it was actually fused in this identical spoon—I have no doubt white metal has been fused in this spoon—here is a file which would be necessary to remove the surplus metal adhering to the coin after it is cast—there is the appearance of white metal in the teeth of this file now—here is a bag of plaster-of-Paris in powder of the same kind of material as the mould is composed of—the shilling produced by Ashton is a good one JURY Q Do the moulds look like the work of experienced hands or of such children as the prisoner A I suppose it quite possible for the prisoners to make them—the mould consists of two circles—this coin resembles a shilling AMELIA

working with metal and it was such dirt as metal would produce—Leonard s hands were dirty likewise and smelt the same—I searched Kelly but found nothing on him—there was another woman there named Dixon whose hands were not dirty and nothing was found on her—there was another man there who got away while the dog was holding me Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q What was the dirt on Newland s hands A Black—it smelt very strongly spoon metal—it was a very particular smell—I can t describe it—we have some metal here and by rubbing it with you fingers it will smell—I did not know the man who escaped—I had never seen him before—there were five persons in the room when I went in—the other woman was discharged before the Magistrate—the man escaped while Ashton was beating the dog off my leg—there were these officers in the room at that time—I believe no officer had hold of the man who escaped—Ashton endeavoured to take him when I called to him—the man ran down stairs—Ashton did not ran down stairs after him—I did not know how many people would be there—I did not intend that one should get away Q You had no notion that there would be one there who it was intended should get away A No—I did not notice the person of that man whether his hands were dirty—I had enough to do with the dog at my leg and to hold those two—I did not go into the house by any signal—the street door was open—I was not told it would he left open for us—I did not expect to find it open—I had no reason to believe it would be open MR ELLIS Q Were you at all privy to the escape of any man A No I intended

hob on the right-hand side of the fire I found this iron spoon containing this metal and under the fire-place in the ashes I found these two pieces of broken mould—on a shelf in the wall on the left-hand side of the fire-place I found a bag containing a small portion of plaster-of-Paris and I found an imperfect cast of a shilling in the spoon—I took Leonard and Newland to the office with Hall and when we were in Holborn in a coach which was just starting a female called out Johanna you can free the other woman if you choose —she answered I will—she knew nothing of what was doing Cross-examined Q Did you know the man who escaped A No—I could not tell whether we should find the door open for I had a very large crow-bar to break it with—It had not been arranged by any body that we should go and find the things as we did THOMAS FINK I accompanied Reynolds and Ashton—I came in after Ashton—I saw Leonard throw something white out of window—as I crossed the room a large dog made a snap at me—I ran to the window and saw Hall in the back yard picking up something like chalk—I assisted in securing the prisoners WILLIAM HALL I went to the skittle ground of the Rose and Crown which faces the window of the room—I saw Reynolds and Fink scuffling with the female prisoners at the window—I stooped down and picked up three counterfeit shillings and one good one—I did not see them fall from the window—they were opposite the window—there is a small wall about seven feet high and they were about two feet from the wall—I picked up several pieces of a mould which have since been put together and from the mould for both sides of a shilling—it was warm at the time—I went upstairs and assisted in taking the prisoners to the office—on the road a person outside said Johanna

counterfeit coin to His Majesty s Mint and have had experience in examining coin for a great number of years This is a plaster-of-Paris mould intended for casting counterfeit shillings—it is composed of the pieces produced by Hall—it has the impressions of the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling—there are five shillings produced which are all counterfeit and cast in white metal—I have compared two of them with the mould and believe they were cast in it—there is an accidental break in the mould with which they exactly correspond—the other shillings I have compared with the mould and I believe they have been cast in it but the break has been removed from these—that is some surplus metal which could be field off—these are in a more finished state—this file might be applied to remove the surplus metal—there appears to be white metal in the teeth of it—the iron spoon might be used to melt the metal before it is poured into the mould—there is white metal in it now which appears to have been an imperfect cast—the mould is made of plaster of Paris and is similar to the plaster of Paris now produced NEWLAND— GUILTY Aged 22 LEONARD— GUILTY Aged 21 Transported for Life KELLY— GUILTY

the fire—Duke and I a strong scuffle with him for some time he being a powerful man—I picked up in front of the fire-place these pieces of mould in a broken state near to where the pieces of mould were I picked up one sixpence with the get on it it was quite hot I could hardly hold it it is dated 1824—I asked Duke to feel it which he did—on the box I found four gets and on the floor near the box I found six counterfeit sixpences and two of them having the gets on—one is dated 1817 and the other 1834—on the right hand hob I picked up one counterfeit sixpence—as soon as Hall entered the room the male prisoner said Hall O my God you had not enough for us last time you will find enough how—I had rather you would take a pistol and blow my brains out —after they were taken away Hall and I went back to the house we had fastened the door and under the stairs we found a saucepan containing powdered plaster-of-Paris ROBERT DUKE I am an officer I accompanied the other officers—I entered the room with them and met the female prisoner against the door she immediately called out Oh Christ what do you want here —I pushed her into the room and observed the man rising from the box—I saw him throw something away and stamping something under his feet what he threw towards the fire-place seemed to be money—we had a severe struggle before we could secure him—the other officers came to my assistance—I searched the fire-place and on the left hand bob I found four counterfeit sixpences in an unfinished state two dated 1817 and two 1834 and under the grate I found another—there was a fire in the grate and an earthen pipkin on it with tobacco pipe in it—there was white metal in the pipkin and a quantity of dross the metal was in a fluid state and the pipkin in a slanting position—I took off the dress—and in the lower part of it observed another counterfeit sixpence but that got into the metal and melted sway—on the box I found a pair of scissors and a file with white metal in it—I searched Smith and found part of a metal spoon in his pock which I gave to Hall also three sixpences and a shilling—the male prisoner s hands were very dirty indeed and smelt very strongly of metal—the female prisoner said she was very glad it was found out for they had been working in dread and fear all the time WILLIAM HALL I am a police-officer I went in with the other officers—Duke and Reynolds were scuffling with Smith—I assisted in handcuffing him and held him while Duke and the others searched his place—I held him while Duke took from his pocket two sixpences one shilling and a piece of a metal spoon—after getting to Hatton-garden office he requested hard to have the good money returned to him—I gave him the same amount from my own pocket and kept this to produce in Court—when we first when in the male prisoner said Hall you did not find enough for us last time you have found enough now —the female prisoner said Well what could you expect Jack all I hope it you will get our children sent with us —there were there children in the court who are in the workhouse now CHARLES PALMER I was with the other officers—I examined the female prisoner s hands—they were very dirty and smelt of metal Prisoner Boyle I was making up a cap my hands could not be dirty WILLIAM HALL I believe her cap was off JOHN FIELD I have examined these articles—I find here a part of a plaster-of-Paris mould for the purpose of casting counterfeit sixpences—it has a portion of the reverse side of a sixpence on it—I have compared one of the sixpences produced with it—it corresponds with it and I believe was cast in it—I have put the pieces of the mould together—here are fourteen sixpences produced all counterfeit and cast in white metal—eight of them correspond with the mould and I believe have been cast in it—here are some gets which correspond with the channel in the mould and some of the sixpences have the gets attached to them now—three good sixpences have been produced by Hall—I have compared two of them with the counterfeit ones—they correspond with them and I believe have been used to make the mould—there are trifling marks about them which induce me to say so and they are the same dates—here is a brown pot with plaster-of-Paris and a spoon which appears to have been used to ladle the metal out—here is a file which has the white metal in the teeth—it might be used to remove the rough surface from the coin and part of a white metal spoon The prisoner Smith put in a written defence stating that on Monday morning the 30th of May he met the female prisoner which whom he had formerly cohabited and being desirous of seeing his children who lived with her he accompanied her to her house and had only been there a short time when the officers came

house in Williams -buildings French-alley Goswell-street about three o clock in the afternoon—I found the street-door open—the parlour door was fast inside—I forced it open and saw the male prisoner sitting by the side of the fire on a chair and the female sitting on a stool by the table in front—on the right-hand-side the male prisoner s wife and child laid in bed—I laid hold of the male prisoner and caught him in my arms—he immediately stooped put his right-hand down and seized a poker—I said James it is of no use you may as well put it down —at the same time from his left hand he dropped something white which he was breaking with his feet—it turned out afterwards to be a plaster-of-Paris mould—took up part of the mould which was quite hot at the time—also a counterfeit sixpence which was very hot among the plaster-of-Paris Dunn The door was not fast it was nearly off its hinges Witness I was obliged to use the crow-bar to get it open—the man s hands were dirty as if with working with metal over the fire—I produce the sixpence WILLIAM BAKER ASHTON I am a police-sergeant I accompanied Reynolds and the others to the house—I saw Reynolds force the door open with his shoulder—when I got into the room I found the man standing up and Reynolds having hold of him—the female was sitting on a stool close to the table facing the man—I saw a counterfeit sixpence found on the floor by Reynolds—it was near the man and about two feet from the woman—I found on the fire a ladle with metal in it in a melted state—on searching the room I found a tin band with plaster-of-Paris adhering to it in a tub of water and another band with plaster-of-Paris to it on a chest of drawers—I found this holder for the mould—I saw Duke find some metal on the table and some on the floor near where they were sitting—I remained there till they were taken into custody—the man s right-hand was very dirty—the first and second fingers were very black as if he had been working over the fire and had plaster-of-Paris round the nails as if he had been working with it ROBERT DUKE I accompanied the witnesses to the place—I searched the room and on the table in front of the fire found a counterfeit sixpence in an unfinished state and on the same table some pieces of metal and a file with white metal and plaster-of-Paris in the teeth of it—a pair of scissors with plaster-of-Paris on them—this piece of rag with a quantity of plaster-of-Paris on it and this piece of ribbon which exactly fits the tin-band as if it had tied it—I found a bowl with a quantity of plaster-of-Paris in it and under the fire-place part of a mould among some wet ashes—I went with them to Hatton Garden office—I did not hear the male prisoner say any thing—his hands were very dirty and his breeches were stained in several places with plaster-of-Paris WILLIAM HALL I accompanied the other officers—when I got into the room I took charge of the prisoners—I produce the mould which I saw Reynolds pick up Dunn Q I should like to know what money you let Duke have that morning A None nor did I see him have any MARY ANN NEWMAN I am a widow and live in Williams -buildings I was

examined both these sixpences—they are both counterfeit and have been cast in the same mould—I have carefully examined the two sixpences with part of this mould and am of opinion they were produced from it—I have no doubt of it as it has the impression of the reverse side of a sixpence corresponding in all respects with the two counterfeit sixpences—the sixpences require a portion of the metal to be removed by a file—the metal in the ladle is of a similar sort to the counterfeit sixpences and the metal in the paper is the same—the bands are what are generally used for making plaster-of-Paris moulds—one appears to have been made in this band—the plaster-of-Paris is the same as the moulds are made with Dunn The woman had not been three minutes in the place—she came to give

January I went to a house at the corner of Queen-street and King-street Seven Dials about two o clock in the afternoon with Ballard Fletcher and Shackell—I went to the street door found it open and proceeded up stairs—on the landing of the first floor I stood a little and heard some persons talking—I fixed myself ready to burst the door open—but hearing somebody move I stood quiet without touching the door—and all at once the key was turned and the female prisoner opened the door—I had not been on the landing place half-a minute before this happened—I rushed by her and saw the two male prisoners—Robert was sitting on the right-side of the fire and the other on the left—the fire-place faced me as I went in—there was a fire in the grate—I saw Robert with something in his hand before I got up to him—I seized it in his hand and it turned out to be a mould—he tried to crush it by pressing his hands together but I got tight hold—my brother officers came in and a scuffle ensued between him and me—I wrenched the greatest part of it out of his hand and some of the bits fell to the ground—I held the parts I got from his hand some time and on looking at it there was the mould and a shilling in it—at the time I laid hold of it the mould was warm—I produce it it has been joined together since—the shilling is in it—there was a Piece of cloth in his hand with the mould in it—I found

went in—in the scuffle this sixpenny mould with a sixpence in it got knocked into the fire—I found on the table a bag with a quantity of plaster of Paris in it—that was not two yards from the fire close to the prisoners and two metal-spoons were on the table—one having some white stuff apparently plaster of Paris in it—I also found a knife on the table with plaster of Paris sticking to it and

Keys assistance and caught hold of Robert Stapleton s wrist and took him to another part of the room—I was going to handcuff him and he threw from his left hind three sixpences into a tub of water—I took them up and searched him and in his left trowsers pocket found another counterfeit sixpence—I knew him before and asked him how he came there—he said he was asked to corns to see if he could make some—the other two prisoners were at the other end of the room at the time—I do not know whether they could hear this Robert Stapleton Q In what manner did you know me A I had occasion to have a communication with him at Bow-street about another case—I never knew him in this situation before—I had not seen him on any charge before WILLIAM BALLARD I am a Bow-street officer I entered behind Keys and saw the girl at the door in the act of moving forward to come out—I beard the bolt of the lock shot—I saw Robert sitting on the right-side of the fire-place and John on the left-side with their faces towards the fire—Keys immediately laid hold of Robert—I passed as quick as possible behind him and saw John with something in his hand which he attempted immediately to rub to pieces—I leaned over him put my arms round him got hold of his wrist and pulled his arms apart—some of the pieces fell from his hand and one piece I made him put on the chair—they have since been put together in my presence by Mr Powell—there are some pieces deficient—it has the impression of the reverse side of a sixpence—I saw Keys take a spoon out of the fire—it was a sort of slow clear cinder fire—he laid the spoon down and I took it up—it was an iron one knocked up to make a tip to pour the metal out—under the grate were a great many pieces of plaster of Paris with no impression on them—they are pieces of metal broken up—there was some metal in the iron-spoon hard as it is now—I never saw it fused ABRAHAM FLETCHER I went with the officers and was close behind Ballard and Keys when they entered the room—Caney endeavoured to force her way out at the door and push by me—I laid hold of her pushed her back into the room and forced her towards the fire-place—Robert Staple-ton was stooping down with his hands inside the fender—I laid hold of him and forced him up and from the place where he was stooping down I picked up part of a mould—I gave it to Keys who has produced it—I searched a cupboard in the room and found some plaster of Paris in a bag and on the table I found this file—Caney said without being asked My name is Mary Caney I wish you would tell Mr Powell that and the others are two brothers —when she was at the office she again stated to me her name and wished me to mention it to Mr Powell—I asked her if she knew the names of the other two as she said they were

was there—she said she went out charing and her husband was a cabinet-maker—she came on Saturday night and paid eight sixpences in advance and engaged the room at 6s a week—it was furnished—it was the room in which they were taken—the prisoner Robert Stapleton came about half an hour after her and they were together in the room—John came in after and to the best of my recollection they all three slept there that night—the room was occupied by the female prisoner from that time up to their apprehension—there was only one bed—the other prisoners often went out and in during the week—John and the female slept there and sometimes they all three slept there Robert Stapleton Q Did you not let me in about ten o clock in the morning in the course of the week A Yes once or twice I did—I am sure

shilling produced by the same witness and which he described as being in the mould and warm when he found it—it is Britannia metal—it appears to have been cast in this mould—I have applied it—here is a good shilling produced by Keys which I believe has been used to make the mould produced as it corresponds with it in all respects —here is a counterfeit sixpence produced by the witness made in the same way as the shilling—there is no mould corresponding with that—this is the half of a mould for casting sixpences but it does not appear to Have been used—it has the good coin now in it with the obverse side of a six-pence—these two spoons are Britannia metal and correspond with the metal of the counterfeit money—one of the spoons has plaster of Paris in it which has been in a liquid state—here is a portion of a broken knife which is necessary to make the channel for the metal to run through—shackell has produced four sixpences all of which are counterfeit but not cast in any mould produced—here is another part of a mould for sixpences having part of the reverse side of a sixpence on it making the impression of both sides—this iron spoon has metal in it which has been in a state of fusion—the file has white metal in the teeth of it—here is some powder of plaster of Paris of which the moulds are formed Robert Stapleton s Defence On the morning in question I visited my brother who occupied the apartment—the landlord came up while I was there and asked permission to remove some articles from a cupboard which was very curiously concealed from our view—he took out some carriage lisps and left us—my brother then ascended to explore the contents of the cupboard and immediately produced the articles which have been found and we out of curiosity attempted to make a shilling with them which filled and we were apprehended in the act—we made no more resistance than was natural to people conscious of their innocence—I have since understood the house is a receptacle for thieves and these things might have been left there—a young man named Grady was recently taken from there for stealing a handkerchief—when the landlord came for the lamps he rased two others and I thought suspected us of stealing them and he has resorted to this savage proceeding for revenge John Stapleton My defence is the same Caney s Defence While these two young men were in my room the landlord came to get something from a cupboard which was in the top of the ceiling—after he was gone they wanted to see what it contained and dragged out a bundle containing the things produced—what the officers say about their asking me to let them do it in my room is quite false ROBERT STAPLETON— GUILTY Aged 19 JOHN STAPLETON— GUILTY Aged 19 CANEY— GUILTY Aged 18 Transported for seven years

apparent resemblance of the obverse side of a shilling —2nd COUNT stating it to be the reverse side MESSRS SCARLETT and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution ROBERT DUKE I am an officer of the police On Monday the 6th of February between six and seven o clock in the evening I went to No 2 Charles-street Drury-lane accompanied by Reynolds and Ashton—I found the outer door of the house open—we went up stairs to the first floor back room—the door was fast—I burst it open and found the three prisoners in the room—Wilson was Bitting on a chair in front of the fire by the side of a table—there was a good fire and a candle burning—on my entering she immediately rose from her seat and leaned forwards to the fire-place—I perceived that she had taken something white from the front of the fire-place she endeavoured to break it with her hands—I seized her hands and in the scuffle she fell on the floor and I found what she had in her hand was these pieces—they are different portions of a mould and are made of plaster of Paris—the other two prisoners were standing by the fire-place—I proceeded to search the room and found in the table drawer this Knife with plaster of Paris on it—I observed in front of the fire an old shovel stuck into the bars that appeared to be the spot where the mould was taken from—it formed a sort of ledge and would have kept the mould hot and it was quite hot when I got it—when we were going to the office with the prisoners Reynolds called to me and then Wilson laid You can t blame me for breaking it as I did it for my own safety WILLIAM REYNOLDS I went with Duke and followed him up stairs—when I entered the room I seized Brady on the right band side of the fire-place where she was standing—I kept her in custody till the other officers came and I then delivered her over to Palmer—are the prisoners were all secured I searched the room and on the left hand side of the fire-place I found a small bag on the ground—it contained some powder of plaster of Paris—between the bars in the fire-place I found an old shovel stuck in and a piece of brown paper in it with plaster of Paris on it—on the hob I found two pieces of broken moulds—I brought Wilson away with me and on the road I said to her You seem very much agitated —she said Yes —I said You are engaged in a dangerous business —she said You can t blame me for breaking them for my own safety if I get over this you shan t find me at the like again WILLIAM BAKER ASHTOK I am a police-sergeant I accompanied the other officers—the first thing I saw on entering the room was Duke take hold of Wilson—she fell on the floor and I found a good sixpence where she fell—I saw Duke take some plaster of Paris from her hand which was quite warm—it was the pieces that have been produced—I found on the left hob this iron spoon with some metal in it and close by the spoon I found this little piece of plaster of Paris—under the stove in the ashes I found several pieces of plaster of Paris which appear to have been moulds for casting money—on the mantel-piece I found this metal spoon and part of an old knife with plaster of Paris adhering to it in a table drawer in front of the fire and a small file with white metal adhering to the teeth of it—I took the prisoner Wild into custody CHARLES PALMER I am a policeman I took charge of Brady and conveyed her to Hatton-garden—on the way to the office she said It was a good job you did not come last night if you bad You would have found a good lot of us WILLIAM HALL I am an officer—I went to the room—I searched Brady and Wild but found nothing on them—I took another person into custody who was afterwards discharged—as I was going along with that person she said in the prisoner s hearing Never mind what are you crying for —they can t hang us but I suppose we shall get lagged —before we left the room I asked Wilson if she lived there and she said she did—I asked her where the landlord lived—she told me the landlady lived down the street next door to the public-house—I fetched her and gave her in charge of the room as the said it was let furnished JAMES RAY I am a tailor I live in the front room of the home—the prisoners occupied the back room—Wilson lived there about three weeks—I the door was always latched—I have seen people coming back wards and forwards—they knocked before they went in and were asked who they

and intended for carting shillings—these two parts formed an entire mould before they were broken—it has been quite perfect but I do not believe it has been used—on one half is the impression of the obverse and on the other a considerable por tion of the reverse side of a shilling and the graining of the edge is here— here is a new white metal spoon which is the metal usually used to make counterfeit coin—here is a small file which may be used to finish the coin I when cast and it has white metal in the teeth of it now—this iron spoon might be used to melt the metal it has metal in it now—the other things are such as would be useful to persons making counterfeit coin—no counterfeit money has been found Wilson s Defence I do not belong to the room—I merely went to stop there as I was very ill but as to making them I did not—the person who was nearest the fire knocked the mould out and it fell under me when the officer knocked me down Wild s Defence I do not belong to the

pieces of counterfeit coin resembling and apparently intended to resemble and pass for 3 current sixpences MESSRS ELLIS and DOANE conducted the Prosecution ROBERT DUNKETT police-constable E 96 On the 18th of April I was in Holborn and received information which induced me to go to No 5 Rose-alley Eagle-street Red Lion-square—the outer door of the house was open—I observed the ground floor window was covered with an apron and coarse towel but they left a small space through which I could see—I looked through and saw the male prisoner sitting by the fire with something in his hand which had the appearance of a small mould—I observed him take a spoon from the fire and pour the contents into what he had in hit hand and which I supposed to be a mould—I tried the window gently and found it was fast—I also tried the door—I procured the assistance of Thornton another officer and we returned to the place—I knocked at the parlour door and then heard a noise like a window sliding backwards and forwards and then the female prisoner Lee opened the door and we both went in—the male prisoner was still in the room sitting where I had previously seen him near the fire—I saw a towel in his lap—I took it from him and in it was rolled up the bowl of a metal spoon—I found an iron spoon on the fire and some white melted metal in it—in the bowl of the spoon was the same description of metal—on my taking the spoon off the fire the male prisoner attempted to throw a large kettle of water over me—it was cold as if it had been just put on the fire—he succeeded in throwing an iron spoon over—I afterwards collected the metal from the fireplace—I asked him what he was doing with the spoon on the fire—he said Making the fire up —I found a paper up the chimney containing plaster-of-Paris and afterwards found a small file some sand and some spoons of the same white metal as was being melted—while I was searching about the male prisoner said You may search about but you will not find any thing —I saw a mould which Thornton found outside the window—the male prisoner said Never mind that was not on the premises Thomas Beresford The policeman knocked at the door and it was opened instantly for him Witness It was not GEORGE THORNTON police-constable E 91 I accompanied Dunkett to the house in Rose-alley When the door was knocked at it was not opened for about two minutes—I heard a noise resembling a window opening and shutting—the male prisoner was sitting by the fire-place with this cloth in his lap and this bowl of a spoon wrapped in it—this iron spoon was on the fire—Dunkett took it off—there was white metal in ft in a liquid state—the male prisoner took hold of a saucepan half full of water and bit Dunkett on the arm with it—some of the water went over him and the contents of the spoon were upset in the fire—some of it was afterwards collected together—I examined the grate and found this knife on the hob—it has white metal sticking to the point of it—the male prisoner said while I was searching It is no use for you to look you will find nothing —from the noise I heard while outside the door I opened the window—it was not fastened—while I was going to it the male prisoner said to the female Turn down the bedstead he can look in there but I said I will look here first —I opened the window and on the sill I found this mould quite hot with a counterfeit sixpence in it—the male prisoner followed me to the window—I said to him What do you call this —he said Never mind it was not found on the premises —on the mantel-shelf I found a file with white metal in the teeth of it and an open penknife with marks of plaster of Paris—I searched the male prisoner and found a purse containing three good shillings and a good sixpence—both the prisoners were conveyed to the station-house ALICE LAST I am a widow and live in Charlotte-street Bloomsbury I searched the female prisoner at the station-house and found two counterfeit sixpences in her mouth—I have had them ever since MARY KNIGHT I am the wife of William Knight a tailor in French-horn-yard Holborn he is owner of the house-No 5 Rose-alley On the 1st of April the female prisoner came to me and took the parlour on the ground floor at 2s 6d a week—she paid the first week s rent and the next afternoon they were apprehended—I never saw the man in the house myself as I never went to the room after giving the woman the key on the 1st of April—she brought the rent to me—she only took one room—I have found a bedstead and a straw bed in the room since they have been gone JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to his Majesty s Mint and have been so many years This is a plaster of Paris mould for casting counterfeit sixpences—it has been used for that purpose and has a counterfeit sixpence now in it made of Britannia metal—a mould of this size would retain heat five or six minutes after it has been used and if the coin remained in the mould it would of course retain the heat considerably longer—the two sixpences produced by Dunkett are both counterfeit and have been cast in the mould—neither of the three are complete—there is a roughness on the edge which should be removed with a file—the files produced would answer that purpose—they have white metal in them—here are two ladles and two broken spoons of a similar metal to the coin and an iron spoon which appears to have been used to melt white metal—it has some now adhering to it—here is some plaster of Paris in powder which is the material of which the moulds are made Thomas Beresford s Defence A knock came at the door—it was opened instantly and the two policemen came in—I was sitting at the table—they caught hold of me and asked what I had about me—I stood up—one of them searched me and opened my coat and waistcoat but found nothing on me—the policeman took but the iron spoon and shoved it in between the two bars and left it in the fire to burn—there are four windows of a blacksmith s shop look over our window—he got a chair and reached out as far as he could before he could get the mould—he then said I have got what I want —I had not been ten minutes in the house when they came in—I deny all knowledge of any thing of the kind Ann Beresford s Defence I never saw any thing of the kind nor did my husband—the two sixpences the policeman dropped in the room and I picked them up—he has not spoken the truth—the usage he gave me was most scandalous THOMAS BERESFORD— GUILTY *Aged 64 ANN BERESFORD— GUILTY *Aged 52 Transported for life Before Mr Justice Littledale

person—he said It is of no consequence my man here is your 1d and thank you—good night —and I bid him good night—I went to my master s and gave him the half-crowns—I told him what had happened and how I had earned 2d —he directly said the half-crowns were both bad and I told a policeman—on the 18th of July I saw the prisoner in Norton Falgate about one hundred yards off—I ran over to him—he made a sudden stop looked at me and then ran and I hallooed Stop thief —Mr Jones stopped him—he then put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and dropped two crown pieces which Jones took out of the gutter—I said was he not ashamed of himself to take in a poor boy like me—he made no reply Prisoner What do you swear to me by Witness He has got a nasty down look—I know him by hanging his head down so and when I gave him the money he trembled like a leaf—I shall be sixteen years old next July THOMAS HYDE I paid Adams 17s 6d on the 15th of July in 7 half crowns which I had received from Mr Ditchett a grocer in Whitechapel the evening before—I believe it all to have been good—I examined it—turned it out on the table and rung it and looked at it piece by piece—I have since seen two half-crowns—I do not believe they formed part of what I paid the lad—I could see that they were bad easily and do not think it possible I could have taken those two for good ones—I did not take notice of the half-crowns I paid the lad but I remember most of what I received in half-crowns were new—I received 10l in silver and 3l 10s was in half-crowns—I have not found any bad money among it JOHN YORK I sent Adams to Mr Hyde to receive 17s 6d —he brought me back seven half-crowns—I looked at them in about two minutes when he began to tell me about the boy—I pulled them out of my pocket and found two bad ones with five more—I rolled them up in paper put them into my waistcoat pocket and afterwards delivered them to the policeman—I am positive they are the same—I am positive I had no other money in the pocket I put them into—I had just changed my trowsers and had no silver about me WILLIAM JONES I am waiter at the Cock On the 18th of June I saw the prisoner running in White Lion-street pursued by Adams crying Stop thief —I caught hold of him at the corner of a street he was going to run down and at the same time I saw him drop two five-shilling pieces which I took up—I met the policeman and gave him into custody with them—I saw a good crown-piece sixpence and some halfpence found on him JOSEPH MEAD I am a policeman The prisoner was delivered into my charge and I received these two five-shilling pieces—I searched him at the station-house and found a good five-shilling piece on him sixpence and 3 1/2 d —he gave the name of George Wilkinson there and then George Smith and then Wilkins at the police-office saying it was all the same it mattered not to him what name he had MR FIELD I have examined the two half-crowns—they are both counterfeit and both cast in the same mould—the two crowns produced are counterfeit and both cast in one mould—they sound pretty much like silver—an accurate ear would detect it but not easily MR HYDE re-examined I was about a quarter of an hour examining and counting the silver—it was about six o clock in the evening Prisoner s Defence I never saw the lad—what he says is false GUILTY Transported for Life First Jury before Mr Justice

counterfeit half-sovereign well knowing it to be counterfeit against the Statute &c MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution CALEB EDWARD POWELL I produce a copy of the record of the conviction of Charles Parr at this Court in January 1835—I have examined it with the original record in Mr Clark s office and it is a true copy— read JOSEPH KENT I was present here in January 1835 when the prisoner was tried and convicted of uttering a gilt sixpence for half a sovereign JAMES ALLING I am a watch-maker and live in Red Lion-street Whitechapel On the 6th of September about half-past five o clock in the afternoon the prisoner came to my shop and asked for a flat watch-key—he spoke like a foreigner—I showed him a card of keys—he put his finger on a white one and threw down a sovereign—I cut the key off and put it in paper—it came to two shillings—it was a plated one—I sent my daughter up stairs for change which she brought down and among it was half a sovereign which I had taken half an hour before—I counted it over to him on the counter—I am sure the half-sovereign I put down to him was a good one—the prisoner said Red one red one — I had put up the white one —I looked him in the face and said This is the one you made choice of do you want a chain or a seal —he said Red one red one —I turned round to get a red one off the card brushed it and put it on a piece of paper—he was moving the change about with his hand over it apparently counting it and said One shilling one shilling —I said The price it two shillings —he said Too much —I took him to be a foreigner—he was dressed very showily with a ring and blue steel spectacles on and a very fashionable coat and hat—I was tired of him being busy and I swept the change all off the counter and laid his sovereign down and thought it best for him to go out of the shop he went on saying Too much too much walking off with the sovereign—I looked at the half-sovereign half an hour afterwards and found it was a spurious one—it was a gilt sixpence—this is it— producing it —I am quite certain the prisoner left this—I had noticed my own half-sovereign—my daughter stood while I counted it over to him—mine was darker and I knew it to be a good one—about half an hour before a neighbors had come in and paid me 4s 6d —I then saw the half-sovereign and looked at it with my eye-glass and put it in a paper into my tea-chest Prisoner Q Did you go to the station-house in Spitalfields to look at a man now in custody A did not—I did not state in my deposition that I was busy in placing a movement in a pair of gold cases and the gentleman that came in held his bead down The witness s deposition being read contained the following sentence he held his head down and said a flat watch-key CHARLOTTE ALLING I am the daughter of the last witness On the 6th of September my father rang the bell for me—in consequence of what he said I went up stairs to the tea-chest in the bed-room—I took out half a sovereign two half-crowns and three shillings—the half-sovereign was in paper—I brought them down to the shop and laid it on the counter close to where the prisoner stood—I am sure he is the man—shortly afterwards I took the coin in question off the work-board—it was not the same half I sovereign that I had brought down stairs—I went to the baker s shop to get I it changed and when I got there I discovered that it was not the same—I returned to my father s and the prisoner was then gone—I am sure I get the same from the baker s that I carried to him—he is not here but it was not out of my sight—he had no opportunity of changing it ANN PENNIALL My father is a waterman living at Greenwich I was at Mr Deer s boot and shoe-maker s shop at Greenwich on Thursday evening the 21st September about seven o clock—the prisoner was in the shop at the time I went in—I am quite sure he is the person—he was dressed very respectably except his shoes which were shabby—he had a chain outside his waistcoat—I heard him ask for a bottle of blacking which came to 1s 6d —he said Will you give me 8s 6d and I will give you half a sovereign —Mrs Deer was attending to him—she looked into the till and said I have no change—I said I have some silver I will give you change intending to speak to Mrs Deer—the prisoner produced the half-sovereign and I gave him four half-crowns—I looked al the half-sovereign and asked Mrs Deer if she thought it was good—she said she thought it was—I had no other half-sovereign in my possession it that time—Mrs Deer then put it into her till as I intended to buy a pair of shoes of her but I found none to suit me and so she returned me the half-sovereign—just about this time Mr Deer came in—the half-sovereign was shown to him and he said it was a gilt sixpence and asked if I should know the man again—I said I should—Mr Deer took care of the half-sovereign—I went with him in search of the prisoner to the Buffalo s head—I had given a description of the person before I got there—I found him there getting change in payment for a glass of ale—I said You have given me a bad half-sovereign—he said he never saw me with his eyes before—the Buffalo is about five minutes walk from Mr Deer s—this was about twenty minutes or half an hour after—I said You purchased a bottle of blacking and I gave you four half-crowns —he said You must be mad or something else —a policeman was there and took him—I think only two half-crowns were found on him—I had noticed he had the remains of a black eye as if it had been bad and was going off and I noticed a broad mourning ring on his hand—I mentioned those circumstances to Mr Deer before I got to the Buffalo Prisoner Q When you told the Magistrate that the gentleman had very shabby shoes did not I take off my shoes and show that they were quite new and then you said they were very dirty A They were covered with mud and dirt which made them appear very shabby COURT Q Was the man at the Buffalo dressed like the man at the shop A Yes—there was no alteration—I am certain he is the man—speak to him from the black eye the ring the watch-chain the shabby shoes and his face—I am quite sure he is the man DOROTHY DEER I am the wife of John Deer a boot and shoe maker in Nelson-street Greenwich On the 21st of September about eight o clock in the evening I was in the shop with Penniall—the prisoner was there and asked for a bottle of blacking—I have heard Penniall s evidence—it is quite correct—the prisoner is the man—Penniall gave me the half-sovereign—I looked at it and put it into the till—I had no other there—I am quite sure I gave her back the same Prisoner Q Did you state before the Magistrate that you placed the half-sovereign along with other gold A No The witness deposition being read at the prisoner desire contained the following statement — When I put the money into he till there was no other half-sovereign in it JOHN RANDALL DEER I remember coming home and finding Penniall in my shop—a piece of coin was shown to me—I examined it and saw it was a gilt sixpence—I gave it to my wife and she gave it to me again after going to a neighbour with it—I delivered it to Sherwood the policeman—Penniall gave me a description of the man and mentioned particular circumstances about him—I was present when he was taken at the Buffalo s head—the appearances she mentioned corresponded in all respects—I did not notice his black eye—he had a mourning ring on his hand and a chain on his waistcoat—his shoes were dusty which gave them a shabby appearance RICHARD SHERWOOD I am a policeman On the 21st of September I met Mr Deer and Penniall and went with them to the Buffalo s Head and saw the prisoner—he had a guard-chain round his neck a mourning ring on his finger and spectacles in his pocket—his shoes were very dirty and he had a mark under his eye as if he had had a black eye—I received from Mr Deer a piece of coin which I have marked—I searched the prisoner but found no other bad money on him—I found one half-crown on him JOHN TUBMAN I am a hat-manufacturer and live in South-street Greenwich about a quarter of a mile from Mr Deer s shop On Thursday evening the 21st of September the prisoner came into the Coach and Horses in the Market-place which is about twenty yards from Mr Deer s—it was about twenty minutes to eight o clock—he came in with a pair of blue steel spectacles on and asked the landlady to oblige him with a sovereign for silver—I saw her give him a sovereign and she took up the silver—there were two half-crowns—I am perfectly satisfied he is the person MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint The coin first produced is a gilt sixpence—it has been altered as the sixpences of that coinage have the garter surrounding the shield—a certain portion of that has been erased leaving the bottom which to a certain extent resembles the rose and shamrock on the half-sovereigns—the other one is also a gilt sixpence but of a different coinage—the obverse side of that is the same as a half-sovereign exactly—the other side is quite different to a half-sovereign—this coinage was called in in consequence of being so much like a sixpence Prisoner s Defence I am rather awkwardly situated—if I had not an hour to live I am not the man who committed either of the offences—I was not in the shops of any of the witnesses in Greenwich—Mrs Dunford has not been examined and I wished to ask her some questions MARGARET DUNFORD I live in Church-street Greenwich My house is between Deer s and the Buffalo s Head—the prisoner came into my shop that evening with another person and dealt with me for two pain of straps—he gave me a sovereign Prisoner Q When you first came into the Magistrate s office and he told you to look at me did not you say you should not like to swear to me A I did say so—I said I wished you to have your hat on and then I should know you better—I am rather particular and I had never seen him without his hat—I wished him to put it on to be more exact and I then knew him to be the person Prisoner Q Did you not request to have a private communication with the Magistrate and did you not point out a gentleman a pawnbroker one of the richest men in Greenwich as my companion A I looked at the gentleman who was in the office and I thought he very much resembled the person of the other man and I asked the Magistrate if I could speak to him—he said If it concerns the offence speak out and I said Does any one know this gentleman —the Magistrate said Yes I do and I then said I am quite wrong then but Mr Powel was present and said he could bear me out for the man who was not in custody was very much like the gentleman—my husband has two shops one a broker s and the other a clothier s—I had seen the prisoner at my shop—he gave me a shilling—that was about eight o clock as near as can be—I should think my shop is not a hundred yards from either the Buffalo or the Coach and Horses—it is rather between them and not a great way from Ailing or Deer s—it is all in the neighbourhood GUILTY * Aged 26 — Transported for Life

went to No 11 Bennett s-court—Bailey and Garby two police-constables were with me—it was between eleven and twelve o clock—I knocked at the door of the house—the female prisoner answered the door—I did not know her before—I asked her whether a female lived there named Hill—she said No —I then asked her whether her husband King was within—she said Yes he was —I immediately ran up stairs desiring the constables to follow me—my lantern was lighted—I went up one pair of stairs—the house consists of two rooms—I went into the room and saw the male prisoner standing by the bed—he was then trampling on a white substance which I could see under his feet—I endeavoured to take him into custody—he crossed the room as quickly as possible and threw a handful of what I considered was half-crowns into his mouth from his right hand—I laid hold of him by the throat and felt them distinctly in his month and in the passage leading to his throat—I could feel distinctly that they were half-crowns—I could not form any idea of what number—I should say there were a great number—he was unable to utter a syllable his mouth was so full—I did not get any of them out—he swallowed them—I called for Bailey to assist me—he came and held his hands—he was very violent attempting to get away—he struggled hard and while he was struggling the female prisoner entered the room with a lighted candle which she immediately blew out and said Oh my God we are done or words to that effect—Bailey said He is reaching towards the fire —he had at that time extricated his left hand from Bailey and Bailey said He is endeavouring to throw something into the fire — the fire was low —I looked and saw him reach his left hand towards the fire—I let go of his throat and told Bailey to hold him—he got his left hand from me and passed something from his left hand to the right and out of his right hand I took four counterfeit half-crowns which I produce—Bailey said There is another at his feet —I looked down and saw him endeavouring to conceal a half-crown on the floor with his feet—I took it from under his feet and now produce it—I desired the constable to keep him in safe custody while I searched the room—he said You need not search any more you have got enough to lag me —I searched his person but found nothing else on him—I picked up the white substance which he was trampling on and have it here—I searched among other places a drawer in a table and found a small file with a quantity of white metal in the teeth of it as it is now—I then found two Britannia metal tea-spoons and on the mantel-piece a large tobacco-pipe with a quantity of metal in it and black as if it had been in the fire—the male prisoner then said That will help to transport me —I found a pair of scissors on the mantel-piece—I afterwards found a flour-tub in the room—on looking into it both the prisoners stated nearly with one breath that it contained flour but on examining it I found it was plaster of Paris in powder—I then went into the lower room and found in the table-drawer there a sheet of glass-papper—I asked the male prisoner if he knew any thing about Hill—he said he did not—he said a man must do something for a living and he might as well be transported—I told him not to say any thing more to criminate himself Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Did he not complain of his situation being very bad A Yes WILLIAM BAILEY police-constable H 104 On the 8th of February Thomas Fuller called me into his shop and gave me a bad half-crown—Power the officer came in soon after and in consequence of what patted I went with him to the prisoner s house—I have heard Power s evidence and confirm what he has said JAMES GARBY police-constable H 30 I went to the prisoners house with the officers and saw the articles found and what took place MR JOHN FIELD I have examined the stuff produced by the officer—it appears to me to be parts of a plaster-of-Paris mould for the purpose of casting half-crowns—on three of the pieces there remains a small portion of the impression of the obverse side of a half-crown—I can trace some of the letters—here is E J G R A on one of the pieces and R G on another—I am satisfied it has been a mould for half-crowns—I have examined the five half-crowns they are all counterfeit and have all been cat in one mould—they are Britannia metal a similar kind of metal to the teaspoons produced—the half-crowns are of the date 1818 and I believe this portion of the mould has been made from the same coin—this powder is plaster-of-Paris—the tobacco-pipe contains white metal of a similar description—this tin band is used to put the mould into shape—the roughness is taken off the coin with a file and the glass paper is used after the file—the scissors would cut off the get which fills up the channel of the mould Cross-examined Q Are there any portions of the mould you can show to the Jury that they can distinguish the letters on A There are letters on it which they can distinguish Q May there not be letters precisely answering to these on the coin of a foreign country A I cannot say that it is impossible—there are many coins without the words Dei Gratia on them—glass-paper is used in a great many trades MR SCARLETT Q One part of the mould has part of the circle A There is part of the engrailed edge—the edge of the half-crown corresponds with it WILLIAM KING— GUILTY Aged 31 — Transported for Seven Years HANNAH KING — NOT GUILTY Before Mr Baron Bolland

it—I found it in pieces—I afterwards shoved him to the other aide of the room—he struggled very violently——his wife at that time came to his assistance trying to get him away from me—I threw him across the chair—Duke came to my assistance—I got him off the chair and saw him bleeding at the neck—I asked him what be had been doing to himself there—his wife said I had done it—I picked up a small knife just against the chair—he said it was an abscess he had in his throat and I afterwards found it to be so—I delivered him over to the custody of Hall—I then picked up off the floor near where he

have been done in the struggle—he had the mould in his band when I entered the room—I went there from information I had received ROBERT DUKE I accompanied Reynolds and assisted in securing the

took place—the pieces were quite hot and broken—they have been since put together—it appeared as if metal had been poured into it—I also found a shilling quite hot on the hearth among the pieces of broken mould and also some parts of broken moulds for half-crowns and sixpences on the hearth among the others but sufficient to discern what they are for—I asked the prisoner if he had any thing else such as files and so on—he said No it is no use if I had I would tell you but I have not WILLIAM HALL I went up stairs soon after the other officers and took charge of the prisoner—I searched about the room and in the drawer of a small table I found three white-metal spoons—I asked the prisoner if it was his place—he said it was and that the goods belonged to Mr Mason his landlord except two small boxes MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin and have been in the habit of examining counterfeit coin many years—this is a plaster-of-Paris mould on which is impressed the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling dated 1816—it appears to have been used for the purpose of casting shillings from the discoloration of the channel by the metal being poured into it—the shilling produced is a white-metal counterfeit shilling which has been cast in this mould—I can say that from the mould being broken across—the shilling has the impression from that crack as if it was thrown down while the shilling was hot—these others are pieces of plaster-of-Paris moulds for casting counterfeit half-crowns—they have the impression of both sides of a half-crown and have been used—the shilling mould would produce a resemblance of a current shilling—the impression in the mould has been made by a good shilling—the other is a mould for six-pences—the spoons are Britannia metal of a similar kind to the shilling—the iron spoon has white-metal of the same description in it Cross-examined Q Have you compared the shilling made of Britannia-metal with a good shilling to be satisfied that it represents it in all respects A I have and have compared the impression of the mould also GUILTY †Aged 23 — Transported for Life Before Mr Justice Williams

uttering counterfeit coin CALEB EDWARD POWELL I am assistant-solicitor to the Mint I produce a copy of the record of the conviction of Charles Chapman and another at this Court in January 1885— read WILLIAM SAWYER I am a police-sergeant I was present when the prisoner was convicted at this court with one Thomas of passing counterfeit coin Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Were you in Court when the verdict was given A Yes and heard the Judge pass sentence I believe—it was twelve months imprisonment—I had had him in custody JAMES DAY I am shopman to Mr Smith a cutler in King William-street London-bridge On the 9th of February between seven and eight o clock I think after the gas was lighted the prisoner came into the shop and asked for a tooth-pick—he was not dressed as he is now—I showed him a tray full—he chose one and gave me a sovereign—I gave him half-sovereign and eight shillings change—he had said nothing about the price—he examined the change and said Do you charge me 2s I never paid more than 18d —I said 2s was the price we never sold them for less—he said I will not have it—give me my sovereign —I did so and he put down on the glass what I supposed to be the change I had given him and left the shop in haste—I looked at the change directly and found a gilt sixpence had been substituted for the half-sovereign—I am certain I had given him a half-sovereign I had looked at it—I went to the door to look after him but could not see him—I put the coin at the back of the till in a compartment which had no money in it—it remained there till about the 30th of March when I took it out marked it and put it into my pocket—I am certain it remained there till I took it out—I had not marked it before—I know it to be the same—I took so much notice of it and the place where I put it was never opened only on certain occasions—there was no other money in that part of the till—the till is under my control—there is no key to it—Mr and Miss Smith had access to it no-body else—I had received one counterfeit half-sovereign once before but on the 9th of February I had none in my possession but this—it has been in my pocket in a piece of paper ever since the 30th of March and I can swear it is the same Cross-examined Q You did not mark it till the 30th of March A I presume that was the day—it was nearly two months after I received it—this is very unlike a good half-sovereign—the impression on the head side is like but the gilding and appearance is not—there is no other person who has access to the shop but Mr and Miss Smith and myself only to-day as we are compelled to attend here—the till was always settled every evening but this coin was never taken out—I saw it every day—an eighteen-penny tooth-pick is very uncommon in our shop—I saw the prisoner at the Compter about a month after the 9th of February that might be a week previous to my marking the coin WILLIAM FERRISON SMITH I am a cutler—Day is my shopman I first saw the counterfeit half-sovereign the evening it was passed—after looking at it I put it under some paper at the back of the till in a separate compartment and it has remained there ever since as far as I know—only Day and myself have access to the till—my sister lives in my house she comes down at night to add up the amount of the money in presence of myself or Day but is never in the shop alone—she is not here being ill and under the care of a doctor HENRY LAMBERT I am shopman to Mr Farthing a cutler in Corn-hill On the 9th of March the prisoner came to the shop about half-part five o clock and asked for a penknife—I took a tray out of the window—he selected one immediately at 6s 6d but did not ask the price—he threw down a sovereign and I put a half-sovereign and 3s 6d change on the glass-case—Mr Farthing had put the half-sovereign into the till that morning—the prisoner then said I don t like this—I will have a silver-handled one —I looked into the trays under the glass-case and told him I had not one—I then looked at the change and discovered that a gilt six-pence had been substituted for the half-sovereign—I took it up rang it on the glass and found it was not the half-sovereign I had put down but a gilt sixpence—I said to the prisoner This won t do Sir —I jumped over the counter and seized him by the collar—he put something into his mouth put his hand to the back of his neck and swallowed twice—I sent for my master who came with a policeman—the prisoner directly snatched at the gilt sixpence which was still lying on the glass case but did not get it—we prevented him and I gave it to my master—the policeman seized him by the throat and tried to prevent him swallowing—I went to the station-house with him and on my return received the sixpence from my master—I took it to the station-house and gave it to the inspector Cross-examined Q Did not you say on a former occasion that you suspected it was a different half-sovereign and not a gilt sixpence A No—I suspected at once that it was a gilt sixpence—I never suspected it was a different half-sovereign JOHN FARTHING I am a cutler in Cornhill On the morning of the 9th of March I put some sovereigns and a half-sovereign into my till—I looked at them all and they were good I believe—I think I an always detect good from bad—I went out in the afternoon there was then only one half-sovereign left in the till—I was sent for home and found a policeman and the prisoner in the shop with Lambert—there was some silver on the counter and what appeared a half-sovereign—I took it up and laid it down again and directly after-wards the prisoner darted forward made a snatch at it and said Give me my money —I knocked his arm on one side and prevented his getting it—the coin was left behind while the prisoner and Lambert went to the station-house—when Lambert returned I gave it to him from the glass-case—it had not been mixed with any other—I can swear it was the same—it had been on the glass-case all the time—I had not left the shop—no one but me and Lambert attended in the shop—several half-sovereigns had been taken that day and paid away—I am satisfied they were all good that were in the till JOHN LLOYD I am a policeman I was called into Mr Farthing s shop on the 9th of March and found the prisoner there in custody of Lambert and some silver and what appeared to be a half-sovereign on the glass case—the prisoner made a snatch at it—I seized him and held him—Lambert said he had got a good half-sovereign in his mouth—I caught hold of his mouth to try to get it but could not—I caught hold of his throat to try to prevent his swallowing but he swallowed twice—after that he said Loose me and I will open my mouth now —Lambert took the gilt six-pence off the counter and gave it to Mr Farthing—the prisoner was taken to the station-house and I found 5s 6d In silver on him but no half-sovereign—Lambert went and fetched the gilt sixpence to the station-house—I was present when he gave it to the inspector and he gave it to me immediately—I produce it—I have kept it ever since Cross-examined Q Was not what Lambert said that he suspected he had got a half-sovereign in his mouth A No I do not recollect the word suspected—he might have said so MR JOHN FIELD I have examined the two counterfeit half-sovereigns—they are both gilt sixpences—the obverse side of the sixpences is precisely the same as a half-sovereign in fact it is made with the same die GUILTY Aged 28 — Transported for Fifteen Years First Jury before Mr Baron Maule

offered a bad half-crown—I gave it to Mr Roberts and then sent for a constable—Mr Roberts had kept the first half-crown Cross-examined by MR PATNE Q Did you look at the first half-crown before you gave it to your master A No—I was busy—Mr Roberts was by the counter while I was serving—there are four shopmen—I put the half-crown on the desk—those persons could get to the desk and an elderly lady came to the desk during Mr Roberts s absence—Mr Roberts showed me the half-crown about ten minutes after I had given it to him—I do not recollect having seen the prisoner before—I went to Hatton-garden the following day and gave evidence but Mr Roberts did not and she was discharged THOMAS ROBERTS On Friday the 12th of April I received a half-crown from Pritchard and gave the change to him—I saw the prisoner and spoke to her—I took the half-crown to the desk and placed it apart from the other money having change to give to another party—I saw it again about ten minutes after and then examined it—it was decidedly bad—I saw the prisoner again that day and received another bad half-crown from Pritchard—I charged her with uttering a bad half-crown and sent Pritchard for a constable—while he was absent I accused her of having passed the bad half-crown in the morning—she denied having been there—I am positive she is the same person—I showed her the second half-crown and told her it was bad—she said it was impossible and asked me to give it into her hand which I did and she hid it in some part of her dress—when the constable came I gave him the first half-crown from the desk Cross-examined Q Were you looking at her when she had the half-crown A Yes but could not see what she did with it—I was about two yards from her—she appeared to me to be putting it into her

not out of my sight—I gave it to Mr Howitt and saw him give it to the policeman a second after—it passed out of my hand into his and directly to the policeman—I can swear he gave the policeman the

open and three females in the passage—we passed them—one of them cried out Bill Bill look out Bill —there was a door on the right hand side of the passage leading into a room which was fastened—persons inside that room could hear that call of Look out Bill —we broke open the door and found it had been fastened by a bed-screw in the floor about eighteen inches from the bottom of the door and a piece of wood put up against it—on entering the room I found the three prisoners there standing by a large clear fire—Holliday had a blue coat on—I believe the others were in their shirt sleeves—there was a table behind them—I handcuffed Holliday—he was the first that was secured—the other constables had a scuffle with the other two men and during that time I saw something thrown towards the fire—it came from that part of the room where they were scuffling—it fell on tie hob—I took ii up and found it was a counterfeit sixpence so hot that I could not hold it and it had a getattached to it—I produce it—I then proceeded to search the room—I found on the hob by the side of the fire-place this pipkin with a quantity of hot metal in it in a liquid state—the pipkin was very hot—the metal is in it now—I found two pieces of metal spoon and a pair of scissors on the mantel-piece and under the ashes this piece of metal—I saw Scotchmer take an iron spoon off the fire with

the prisoners in the room—Holliday had his coat on—Brown had his shirt sleeves turned up and Graham had his jacket sleeves slipped up—there was a large clear fire and an iron spoon on it contain ing

table containing water—he afterwards put his hand into it and when it came out it was covered with a kind of composition which I found was plaster-of-Paris—in the scuffle he put his foot into the basin and broke it in pieces and I picked up part of the contents—I produce what was in it then—I cannot say what it had been—it is in the same state now only dry—I handcuffed the prisoners—on the floor I found a counterfeit sixpence and near the table two pieces of metal—within about eighteen inches of the door I found this bed-screw hexed into the floor up to the nut—when we first seized them

no impression on it but it has the appearance of having been a mould and there is a discoloration on it as if metal had been on it—here are two pieces of Britannia metal spoons—the metal in the pipkin appears of the same description—this iron spoon would be used to lade the metal out of the pipkin and pour it into the mould—here is a small quantity of powdered plaster-of-Paris which would make a mould—scissors are used to cut off the get—here are all the materials for coining except the mould Brown s Defence I am quite innocent—I was going by the door—Holliday was standing at the door and asked us to go in and have a game at cards—we did so—I said I would have a wash before I began—I took off my coat and sat down to have a game at cards and all at once the door was broke in and in the confusion I tried to get away—we did not know what was the matter—we were not in the room ten minutes—the policeman knows we were playing at cards Graham s Defence I have nothing more to say than he

t18400302-818  818 WINIFRED DWYER MARY LANGLEY and ANN STYLES were indicted for feloniously making on the 12th of February 3 pieces of counterfeit coin resembling and apparently intended to resemble and pass for 3 of the Queen s current coin called sixpences THE HON MR SCARLETT and MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM STANNARD police-sergeant G On the 12th of February at a quarter past three o clock in the afternoon I went to No 4 Old Nicholl-street Shoreditch accompanied by Redman and Fink—Fink was left outside—we went to the first floor front room—we found the door fastened inside—I could see through a crack in the door into the room—we could not see the fire-place but saw the three prisoners sitting on stools apparently before the fire—two had their backs to us and Styles was sitting sideways—I could see she had a piece of money in her left hand and was doing something to it with her right hand—the other two sat very close to her—I could not see whether they were doing any thing—I noticed them for about a minute and then burst the door open—it gave way and I fell down inside the room—Dwyer and Langley went towards the window—Styles remained on the stool apparently in a fainting state—we gave her some water—after securing the three prisoners I searched the room and under a stool where Styles sat I found two counterfeit sixpences which I produce—in another part of the room by the side of where Dwyer stood I found a pair of scissors and two counterfeit sixpences behind a bedstead one of which has the get attached to it—that one was quite cold—there was a fire-place close to where they had been sitting—I searched about the grate and on the left-hand hob I found a piece of tin called a band—there was apparently plaster-of-Paris sticking to it—on the table I found a teacup a piece of metal spoon and some plaster-of-Paris in a damp state and on a shelf over the table was a bag containing plaster-of-Paris in a dry state—I merely felt the prisoners clothes—2 3/4 d was found on Dwyer but nothing on the others—all their hands were very dirty and Styles s particularly smelt of metal and antimony—the three prisoners were the only persons in the room—I asked who the room belonged to—Styles answered It belongs to Mrs Cannon and Dwyer said Yes it belongs to me Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How did you find the outer door of the house A Open—the room-door was fastened with a staple and hasp inside—nobody went in at first but I and Redman—Fink came up about four minutes after—I found the sixpence and scissors behind the bedstead which is near the window—they went towards the window on my tumbling into the room—I think Shannon was the person s name whom Styles said the room belonged to Styles Q Had not I my bonnet and shawl A Yes—the others had not COURT Q Was the window open or shut when they went to it A I do not know—I did not observe whether it was open or shut HENRY REDMAN I accompanied Stannard to the room—I entered the room with him and saw Dwyer and Langley go to the window—I ran after them but before I could get to them Langley opened the window and threw some white substance out—I laid hold of her and Dwyer—Standard brought Styles from the fire and we handcuffed them—I searched the room and took this pipe from the fire with the bowl red hot and some fluid metal in it—I found a pot on the hob with a piece of white metal in it and on the hearth near where Langley and Dwyer went from I found three counterfeit sixpences—I found no good sixpence—there was a small bit of a spoon in the pot with the other metal Cross-examined Q About what size is the room A About ten feet square—there is only one window—there was a bedstead and table and the stool they sat upon—I did not observe any chairs Langley I did not throw any thing out of window—it was never opened at all JOHN FINK I am a policeman I accompanied Standard and Redman to the house in question—I remained in the middle of the road while they went up—I saw Langley come to the window open it and throw this mould out into the road—it was quite hot at the time—it had been sticking together but it separated into two pieces in falling—there was nothing in it—I took it up and then went up stairs—I took charge of the prisoners and on the floor I found this piece of metal MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint Here are seven sixpences all counterfeit and all cast in the same mould—this is a plaster-of-Paris mould in which they have been cast—this one with the get tallies with the mould as well as the rest—here are two more gets which also fit the mould—here is a tobacco-pipe with metal in it similar to the sixpences—the metal in the spoon is of a similar kind—it is Britannia metal which is a mixture of tin and antimony which has a smell about it—this is plaster-of-Paris in powder—this piece of tin is used to make the mould to confine the pitster-of-Paris into a shape—the scissors would be used to nip off the gets—they generally make the impression in the mould with a good sixpence Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What would require to be done to these sixpences before they were circulated A Six of them have surplus metal round the edge which should be removed with a file but one appears to have been filed and would be in a state for circulation Langley s Defence I met Dwyer in Shoreditch at a quarter-past two o clock and asked where she had been—she said with her husband s dinner—I asked her to have a pint of beer—we both went into a public-house and had a pint of porter each—directly afterwards she asked me to go home with her to have a cup of tea and I went up stairs with her—any transaction of coining I know nothing about Styles s Defence— written — I beg to inform you my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury that I am an unfortunate young woman and became acquainted with a young woman named Mary Shannon the daughter of Mrs Dwyer the prisoner at the bar with me This acquaintance originated in consequence of my mother and myself residing very near to them in the same street and having lent this young woman an apron during the week I stood much in need of it I had been on an errand for my mother into Bishopsgate-street and on my returning home having to pass by their door I ran up stairs and inquired for her daughter Mary Shannon and was answered she was not within but expected her home in a few minutes I had my bonnet and shawl on me at the time and as she was expected to return in a few minutes I waited there I most solemnly declare to you my Lord and the Gentlemen of the Jury I had not been in the room more than ten minutes when the officers came in and took me into custody together with the other two female prisoners now at the bar with me I humbly beg leave to state that the officers who took me into custody if required by your Lordship can declare upon oath I had those articles upon me at the time they took me into custody I therefore humbly hope this circumstance will convince you that I had not the smallest connexion or was in any way interested in the business my fellow prisoners was then carrying on and the circumstance that led me to their room was no other than what I have before described to get an apron from her daughter that belonged to me Two witnesses deposed to Styles s good character DEYER— GUILTY Aged 42

officers that morning—I did not know what brought them there—they did not tell me what they had found—I asked why they came and they said they should want me afterwards—I said if they did I should

t18401123-72  72 GEORGE COATES FRANCIS M MURRON and GEORGE BECK were indicted for feloniously and falsely-making and counterfeiting 3 pieces of counterfeit coin intended to resemble and pass for 3 sixpences MESSES BODKI and ESPINASS conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM PENNY I am an inspector of the G division of police On the 9th of November I went to No 11 Carrier-street St Giles s with Fink and Farrell—I went into the yard of the house up some wooden steps to a room detached from the house—I found the room-door with a padlock outside which was locked—we broke into the room and found the three prisoners sitting in front of a very clear fire on a small bench—Coates was in the centre—they immediately stood up—Coates had something in his hand which he dashed into a tub of water—he then stooped and put his hand into the tub—he pulled it out again and his hand was all white with plaster of Paris—I emptied the water out of the tub and found a quantity of plaster of Paris at the bottom which I put into a cup—I found these two pieces of metal in front of the fire-places-one was so hot I could scarcely hold it— they are called gets which is the part that runs into the channel of the mould—I found a crucible on the fire three parts full of Queen s metal in a liquid state—I found six pieces of the same kind of metal on the mantel-piece and near these pieces of metal twenty counterfeit sixpences on the mantel-piece fresh made—Coates said You have done a great deal and what have you done now JOHN FINK I am a policeman I accompanied Penny to the room and saw the prisoners—I produce an iron ladle which I found on the fire with metal in a fluid state and on the table nine metal spoons one of them bent up—Beck said it was an unfortunate job for him he had merely come into the room for 1s which Coates owed him and he supposed it would make no difference that they should all share the same fate—M Murron said he had just been to fetch a sheet of writing-paper for Coates—I examined M Murron s and Beck s hands—they appeared black as if they had been handling metal—I found a sheet of paper on a shelf with a piece torn off the comer—it appeared as if it had been there some time for there were cobwebs over it—we were obliged to burst the door open—the padlock was fastened outside BENJAMIN FARRELL I accompanied the witnesses—when I got in I took Coates into custody just as he drew his hands out of the tub of water—they were all white and he wiped them on his trowsers—I found on the table two files two pairs of scissors a knife and two spoons—the files had some sort of metal on the edges as if they had been used and there was white on the knife similar to what was on the prisoner s hands JOHN COFFEE I live at No 3 Carrier-street St Giles s I let out No 11—I let the room the officers went to to Coates three or four days before they were apprehended—there was a lock on the door and no key to it—my wife put a padlock on before he took it—it was not to be fastened except when they were out—they could not fasten it when they were inside—I know the other prisoners—I see them in the neighbourhood almost every day—they live in St Giles s Coates Q Is not that the padlock you gave me when I took the room A I do not think it is JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to the Mint This plaster of Paris appears to have formed part of a mould—I have examined the pieces—they present at present no impression at all—some pieces from the discolouration on them appear as if heated metal had been poured into them—putting a plaster of Paris mould into water and squeezing it would destroy its appearance—it would absorb a considerable quantity of water and expand and be easily obliterated especially if the mould was hot at the time—these sixpences are all counterfeit and cast in a mould—they are composed of what is known as Britannia or Queen s metal—they are all impressions from the same mould—these spoons are the same kind of metal—here are three gets formed of the same kind of metal which would be formed in the channel of the mould—the metal in the crucible and ladle are of a similar description—here are two files in the teeth of which there appears white metal—the knife has the appearance of plaster of Paris on the blade—the scissors might he used to cut off the get from the coin—these articles might be applied to the purposes of coining Coates s Defence On the 9th of November I asked M Murron to fetch me a sheet of writing-paper he had not been there three minutes before Beck came in and asked for what I owed him I gave it him he had not been there two minutes before the door was locked outside by somebody and then the officers came it is not the padlock my landlord gave me M Murron s Defence Coates came and asked me to go for a halfpenny sheet of writing paper and bring it up to his place I took it up he was sitting in the room by himself I saw a cup on the table with something like whitening in it he asked me to sit down Beck came up and asked him for a shilling he had lent him and he gave it him I then went to the door and found it locked and said George the door is locked Beck s Defence I went and asked Coates for the shilling I had lent him he gave it me and I showed it to the policeman when he searched me I went towards the door Coates said Stop a moment you shall have a drop of beer

conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM PENNEY I am a police-inspector of G division On the 29th of December I went in company with Redman Farrow and Humphreys to No 3 Church-street St Giles s and found the street-door open I went up to the first floor front-room which I found locked inside—I forced it open and saw the prisoner Wicks sitting on a bed quite close to a large clear fire—Perkins was standing up by the fire with a mould in his left hand and a saucepan full of hot metal in his right hand—he dropped both—Wicks called out Jem you b—r break it you b—r smash it —Perkins had the mould under his feet at the time and ground it to powder except a few bits which went right and left of his feet—on the fire was a small pot red hot without a handle nearly full of white metal in a liquid state—I took it off—it was hot and I dropped it on the ashes—both the prisoners kicked it under the bed—I took it up and produce the contents which were strewed about—I afterwards lifted up a loose board on the landing just outside the door and found a mould there for a half-crown of George III —Perkins said it was not his and he knew nothing about it— Perkins Q Is not the other room nearer to the place the mould was than mine A There is a room on the same landing as near but not nearer—your door was locked—I tried to open it—you said yourself I must have given it a fine kick for the staple was in such a way HENRY REDMAN I am a policeman I accompanied Penney to the house—the room door was fastened inside—I did not hear the prisoner make any remark about the staple—I saw the door tried before it was forced and we were obliged to make a regular rush before it opened—I found Perkins standing by the fire and Wicks sitting on a bedstead close to the fire—Perkins let something fall from his hand like a white mould—he put his foot on it before I could get hold of it—I saw the pot of white metal—an iron spoon fell from Perkins—it was quite hot—I found some white metal in the cinders and a counterfeit shilling quite hot which I produce—I found part of a Britannia-metal spoon on a table near the fire-place—on the mantel-piece was an old pair of scissors—I saw Penney take the pot from the fire—I picked part of it up from under the bed—it was still hot—both the prisoners attempted to kick it and Wicks called to Jem to break it BENJAMIN FARROW police-constable G 200 I went with the other officers—I picked up part of a mould in front of the fire-place on the floor—there were four or five pieces of a mould there—there was an impression on only one piece—a great deal was crushed to powder—on a shelf on the right hand of the fire-place I found a quantity of plaster-of-Paris in brown paper and on the same shelf a cake of white metal cold which had been melted DANIEL HUMPHRIES I accompanied the witnesses to the house and saw the mould found under the board on the landing—I found four counterfeit sixpences under the next board quite handy to the mould RICHARD LANGLEY The house the officers went to belongs to me—I let it out—I let the front room first-floor about eight months ago to a young woman who gave the name of Perkins —she lived there with the prisoner as her husband—he has paid me the rent about half a dozen times—I let it at 7d a-night to be paid every night—I generally send over for the rent but sometimes Mrs Perkins brought it—Wicks is an acquaintance of Mrs Perkins s—I have seen them a great deal together—I have seen her in the room with both Perkins and his wife Perkins Q Was there a lock on my room A There was a bolt and latch on every room—the board which was taken up is rather nearer to your room than the other I think if there is any difference—the end of the board comes against the front room door—any thing could be put there without going into your room—one Smith lived in the back room—I believe he removed there a day or two after the officers came JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint— examining the articles produced —here are two or three small pieces of plaster-of-Paris which I believe have formed part of a mould—on one piece I find a small part of what I believe to be the impression of the dex-ter part of the shield the three lions and a portion of the Hanoverian crown—here is a cast counterfeit shilling in an unfinished state and some white metal of a similar description to the shilling which is Britannia metal—the shilling is of Geo III and has the Hanoverian crown corresponding with this portion of the mould—here is a small pipkin or blacking-pot with similar white metal—this iron spoon appears to have been used to fill the mould—it is tapered at the point to make a channel and some white metal adhering to it—here is some plaster-of-Paris in powder of which moulds are generally made—this part of a spoon has been melted—scissors are used to cut off the gets—here are four counterfeit sixpences cast in white metal and a complete mould for half-crowns which appears to have been very much used it is perfect and has white metal now remaining in it—it is much discoloured with heat Perkins I hope you will consider it is my first offence Wicks It is my first offence PERKINS—

Humphries police-constables—the street-door was open—I went to the front room second floor—the room-door was fastened by a small table being against it—I forced it open went in and the prisoners were there—Beckwith was sitting on a chair in front of a clear fire with nothing on but his trowsers—he had no shirt on—he had what appeared to be a white mould in his left hand made of plaster of Paris—immediately that I went in he threw it on the floor jumped on it and broke it into several pieces then laid hold of an iron spoon which was between the bars of the fire the bowl of which was red hot and full of white metal in a fluid state he threw the contents all about the floor and at the same time with the other hand swept a quantity of counterfeit sixpences off the table—part of the metal which was thrown from the spoon was picked up—I took up nine sixpences myself two of them quite hot—I picked up several pieces of the plaster of Paris which he threw down but they had no impression on them—the prisoner Foot was standing up with her gown off washing at the table—she cried out You b—r Jack you b—y b— you have sold us but we will tell you b— where you make —she said this to several prostitutes who were at the door which was open—there was no man there—Jack is a man they know among themselves—Beckwith made use of similar language several times saying It is that b—y b—r Jack that has sold us Beckwith I was standing up when you came in did you find the spoon in the fire Witness No you pulled it out JOHN FINK I am a policeman I went with Penny—I entered the room at the same time as him and saw Beckwith sitting in a chair in front of a very clear fire about three feet from it—he had something white in his left hand which he threw down jumped on it and broke it into several pieces—I laid hold of him—at the same time he took from between the bars of the grate an iron spoon with metal in a fluid state and threw it up the contents of which I took off the floor and at the same time he swept off the table a quantity of counterfeit sixpences with his hand—he was sitting between the table and fire-place—I afterwards picked up some of the fragments of what he threw down—two of them have letters on them—I produce a counterfeit sixpence and part of a get separated from a sixpence I have a sixpence which it fits—I took up the sixpence myself—it was quite hot and so was the get—I picked up some of the white metal which he threw from the spoon and produce it—I searched him and found a knife in his trowsers pocket—it has some white spots on it similar to plaster-of-Paris—when I entered the room Foot was standing at a small table washing—it was the same table as the sixpences were on—the tub was at one end and the sixpences at the other—Foot said it was that Jack had sold them and she would sell him for she knew where he made them—Beckwith used similar expressions—they were both taken into custody BENJAMIN FARROW I am a policeman I went with the others officers to the prisoner s lodging—I produce a spoon—the bowl seems to be bent up for the purpose of pouring the metal out—it was quite hot when I took it up—I was obliged to drop it—I produce some white metal which I found quite hot on the floor and a counterfeit sixpence which was hot—a pair of scissors a file and part of a Britannia metal spoon DANIEL HUMPHRIES I am a policeman I went with the officers and searched a cupboard in the prisoner s room and found some plaster-of-Paris in powder—I found a counterfeit sixpence on the floor close to the fire MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint These pieces of plaster-of-Paris are fragments of a mould—I have examined them with a glass—here are two small pieces which I believe to have formed part of a mould for casting sixpences—on one of them is a small portion of the wreath on the reverse side of a sixpence—on the other piece there is still apparent some of the letters which I believe to have formed part of the legend of the obverse side—there is the letter A which I believe ends Victoria and Dei —here are some other pieces without impressions—here are almost sufficient to produce a mould—here is part of a Britannia metal spoon similar to the metal counterfeit coins are generally made of—here is some small portions of the same metal and a lump of metal termed a get which fills up the channel in the mould where it is poured down—it appears to have been broken off the coin not cuthere are twelve sixpences all counterfeit which have all been cast in one mould and are all Britannia metal similar to the spoon—I cannot say which sixpence the get was broken from—here are scissors a knife and file which are useful in coining—the file appears to have white metal in the teeth—it is usually applied to remove the surplus metal from the edge—here is plaster-of-Paris in powder—this iron spoon appears to have had fused metal in it—it is doubled up at the top to conduct the metal into the small channel WILLIAM PENNY re-examined Some of the parts of the mould were left behind being reduced to powder Beckwittis Defence I got up about ten o clock on Saturday morning and was at breakfast when a young man came into my room called Jack—his name is John Edmonds—he had breakfast with us left and came back in about half an hour—we got talking—he asked if I was not at work—I said I could not raise money

let them be till I come back —he said he should be about a quarter of an hour—I undid the handkerchief and turned them out on the table—there were spoons and things and I tried the experiment on them myself—just as I was doing that the policeman rushed in and took them away—I am quite innocent of knowing what they were at the time Foot s Defence On Saturday morning about ten o clock I was at breakfast with Beckwith a young man came in who he called John—he sat down and had breakfast—he got up and said I will come back in three or four hours —I began to wash after he was gone and about

Excise-officer In consequence of information on the 9th of Feb I obtained a warrant and on the 10th I went with it with William and Thomas Hughes M Kay Shakesby and Frith to No 61 Princes-street Lambeth about a quarter after eleven o clock in the morning—we knocked at the side-door twice—there was about a quarter of a minute between the two knocks—there are two doors one in the street and a

left the door and made his way towards the stairs—we secured him about half way up the first flight of stairs—he was taken down into the front parlour by myself and Thomas Hughes and given into custody of a policeman—I then proceeded up stairs to the back room first floor and there saw a chair standing opposite the fire-place with a board lying across it and a fire-shovel with one end resting on the board and the other between the bars of the grate—I saw some moulds with coin in them and a great quantity of coins lying about—I put my hand on the moulds and they were quite hot—there were two shillings in one mould and one shilling in another—there was a pipkin on the fire with white metal boiling in it in a fluid state—I took it and threw it on the floor—there was nobody in the

whatever—I found no female apparel about the first floor—I do not think there was any—Mr Hughes was with me when I searched—I took possession of nothing besides these articles which I considered suspicious—when I look Brown into custody he did not say he could not be bound by what his lodgers did and did not know anything about it—I was not with him above a minute—he did not say in my presence that he had a female lodger who had people coming to visit her—I saw no one in the house besides these two—I first saw Tucker down in the still room in the custody of the police—that was below in the kitchen I think THOMAS HUGHES I am assistant to William Hughes the supervisor of Excise I accompanied the officers to this house on the day in question—I observed Brown open the door—I asked if Mr Smith lived there—he attempted to shut the door but I put my foot in and it was forced in by Mr Rice—when I got in Brown made his escape towards the stairs—he got half-way up—I followed him pulled him back and after a deal of difficulty two or three of us got him into the front-parlour and kept him in custody—he was in his shirt sleeves which were tucked up—he asked for his coat and said Do I know whether I came out of the still-room meaning down stairs or from up stairs —I told him From out of the still-room meaning down stairs —he said he came down stairs and not up stairs I am sure of that—he was making his way up stairs when I went in—I went over the house after he was in charge of the police—I did not find anything—I did not observe any sign of paper-staining or paper-manufacturing—all the rooms were empty but the still-room the coining-room and the back kitchen—there were seven rooms-five were totally unfurnished—the still-room it on the ground floor under the front parlour—that was one of the furnished rooms—the front parlour was furnished—that would make three rooms furnished the front parlour another room and the coining-room—there was a bed and bedstead a box or two and a chair in the coining-room also a bed in the back parlour and one in the front parlour—there were but two beds in the house Cross-examined Q Had he his coat off when you took him A Yes it was in the front parlour—I believe I have told you all the conversation I had with him—he did not tell me he could not be answerable for what his lodgers did—I am the son of Mr

supervisor in the Excise On the 10th of Feb I accompanied the other witnesses to No 61 Prince s-street—I guarded the front door to see that no one came out while the other parties made their entrance—I went in after them and found Martin in custody of Rice and my son—they took him to the front parlour—I left him in custody of my son and the police and proceeded after Rice up stairs to the room where I found the implements of coining—these are the articles which I produce—this silver watch was lying in the centre with two heaps of base coin on the mantel-piece—the moulds were quite hot—I could not hold them in my hand at first—there were two impressions in one mould and one in another—I produce a file a knife and a pipkin—when I left the room up stairs I proceeded down stairs the under-ground kitchen or cellar where I found Tucker and the private still going on—I there found a quantity of spirits—I examined some ashes that were lying in the still-room and found one of the base shillings unfinished which I produce—this shilling was not kept apart from the others—they were all put together—it was rough in the edges—I also found some pieces of cuttings or parings of metal lying in the ashes—I did not take any notice of them—I left them there—they had a bright appearance as if not long cut off—they had been melted—they had been pared off the shillings I have no doubt—I asked Tucker how long he had been in the house—he said between three and four months—I asked him if the man Martin had been there the same time he had—he said they both came together—I then asked if he knew any thing about the coining going on up stairs—he said no the business was carried on up stairs by the other man Martin and he did not know what he was doing there—I said it was impossible for the business to be carried on up stairs without his knowledge—he said he did not know what he was doing—I then asked him if they were not partners—he replied they were—I asked him about the shilling I found in the ashes—he seemed rather confused at the first moment and stated after they might be brought down in the ashes a Martin used to bring his ashes down into that room—I do not believe he saw me rake it out—the front parlour had a few chairs in it and a table—I found some papers in a cupboard such as receipts for hats which I did not remove—I also produce a receipt from the landlord which I found in an ornament on the mantel-piece in the front parlour—I went over the house—I did not see any thing of paper-staining or hanging going on—not the least—there was one bed in the coining-room and there were two or three beds on one bedstead in the room below—the distance between the still-room and the coining-room is perhaps about ten yards Cross-examined Q I suppose your cross-examination of Mr Tucker took some time A Not a very little time—I might be five minutes in the questions I put to him—I have been in the Excise upwards of twenty-seven years—I did not arrange this conversation when anybody else was present—there were parties in the room—I cannot charge my memory at the present time who the parties were that were present—I am sure there were parties present because they had not left the still-room—Tucker was with me in the still-room the police and also my brother officers—I cannot charge my memory with their names—they could not be very far off—the room was not three yards across—I cannot say whether my son or Rice was present or the other witnesses—Martin was taken down out of the parlour into the still-room—I do not know whether he was present—it might be before he was taken down—I think there were persons in the room at the time—those were the words that I put to Tucker—I have told all that was said—I never heard a word about a female being up stain before this time from anybody—my information was connected with the private still and something else—I did not know where to find the still till I got to the house—I first went into a lobby which leads to the staircase—the first room I went into was the room up stairs where the coining was going on—that was the first place I went to after Brown was brought down stairs into the front parlour—I assisted in getting him into the parlour and I bolted up stairs a quick as I could possibly go leaving him with my son and the police—I think there was a gown or something of that sort which Tucker said belonged to his daughter—there was a little piece of very inferior linen in a chest in Tucker s room in the back kitchen where the bed was adjoining the still-room going down to it JOHN CHARLES KAY I was one of the Excise officers that went to the house—I remained outside for some time to see that nobody escaped—when I went in 1 found the prisoner Brown in custody of Thomas Hughes and the policeman just coming off the stairs as I entered the house—I assisted Thomas Hughes in securing him—he became very restless—I told him to be quiet—we took him into the parlour and got his coat—I left him for a moment and ran up stairs where the coining had been going on—I just cast my eye round on the things but did not touch anything—Thomas Hughes called me down stairs as Brown was very restless—I assisted in taking him down into the still-room where I found Tucker—Thomas Hughes and one of the policemen was there—William Hughes came down then to me—I continued there for some time—I heard William Hughes say he had picked up a shilling while I was in the still-room—he was raking about the ashes at the time—Brown was there at the time Hughes said he had found it—I did not hear the coversation between William Hughes and Tucker—I heard him talking to him—I did not direct my attention to what was passing—my attention was chiefly called to looking after the still seeing there was no accident happened with that—I left my brother officers to attend to that THOMAS SHAKESBY police-constable L 114 I went to this house—Brown was given into my custody—I took him to the station and then returned to the house—I went up stairs to the front room first floor and found these things by the fire-place—I found this plaster of Paris at the right-hand side of the fire-place in this state

state—these white metal spoons are corresponding metal to that in the pipkin and the counterfeit coin—they are known as Britannia metal—the crucible appears to have been used for the purpose of fluxing metal—it has a portion of metal of a similar description in it now—the files would be used for the purpose of removing any superfluous metal from the edge of the coin after first cast—they appear to have white metal in the teeth—here are some more clippings of white metal of a similar description—they appear to have been taken from the edges of the counterfeit coin after first cast—such particles would attach to the coin cast in these moulds and must be removed by scissors a knife or file—these appear to be of that description—here is a knife and files—there appears to be every thing necessary for coining—here are also five shillings cast in the double mould—they are different from the twenty-eight MR BALLANTINE called JAMES ALLEN I have known the prisoner Brown two months I know the house he lived in No 61—I have brought coke to the house and shot it in the bottom room by Mr Brown s orders—I have brought a bushel and half a hundred weight of coke up stairs as far as the front door and shot it in the cupboard on the left of the party that lived up stairs by order of the party that lived in the room—she was a tall genteel woman dressed in black—I have seen her standing at the door—she lived in the room—she was standing there when I brought the coke and coal and showed me the cupboard where to shoot it—on the Sunday after that I served her with a bundle of greens—I never was in the room in my life—I saw her at that time—she paid me for the things—I cannot tell how often I have been in the house as often as they ordered me to bring things—I have not seen this woman in the lower room—I never saw Brown in the upper room Tucker s Defence I worked the still since I went into the house but I do not know any thing about any thing else not the least all the ashes

was guarding the front door and a window very near it that no person might make their escape—Kay was standing at the side door—we were so stationed round the house that no one could escape—the windows were all fast down with the catch and not disturbed—I examined every part of the house and am sure no one could have escaped without our notice J C KAY re-examined I was stationed at the side door and window—it was impossible that any one could have escaped without my perceiving it—the other witness was at the front door—there is no other door no back door—the back of the house butted on other premises Brown There are two sliding windows to the top room from which any body could escape Tucker told Hughes that a woman went out three minutes before they came in and they were not round the place then I took the house intending to work the still with Tucker as partner and the upper part of the house was occupied by other people BROWN— GUILTY Aged 30 TUCKER— GUILTY Aged 55 Transported for

the man—he was dressed in his shirt-sleeves and coat and waistcoat and he had on a rough light coat before the Magistrate—I know him by his countenance COURT Q Do you remember whether there were many half-crowns in the till A I cannot say—there was not a great deal of money perhaps 9s or 10s in the till WILLIAM RUNDELL HOARE I keep the Ben Johnson in Great Wild-street On Saturday the 11th of

out—one went on one side of the street and one on the other both running up the street—Robins came up almost directly—I gave him the half-crown telling him the circumstances—I think I detained them six or seven minutes—I had never seen the prisoner before but he had got my name very perfectly Cross-examined Q Did you say any thing before the Magistrate about the prisoner running away A I did but it is not in my deposition—they both ran away—I could see them all the way up the street—he did not produce the half-sovereign to me—I had never seen the other man before—I should know him again if I saw him—he was dressed in light bricklayer s trowsers with lime or something about it and a cap on—the prisoner had a black hat with crape round it neither coat nor waistcoat on and I do not think he

it—he walked across the street—whether he ran I cannot say—I was examined before the Magistrate and my examination was read over to me—this is it—I did not to my recollection say any thing before the Magistrate about having seen the prisoner on the 11th but it was stated at the first examination—I said I had seen him before — The deposition being read omitted to state that the witness saw the

person by his coming the week before and coming as a regular customer always for eggs—he had come several times for eggs the week before and my girl served him—I have no doubt whatever of him—he wanted to take up a shilling instead of sixpenee which made me notice him at the time he passed the half-crown—I knew him at that time COURT Q Did he ever come after he left the bad half-crown A Yes—I told my husband he was the person and my husband went to get the half-crown—I believe the prisoner took notice that there was something—he said I have forgot the money —he went out of the shop and never returned JAMES BROWN police-constable F 142 On the 17th of Feb I went to Mr Phillips s and received from Mrs Phillips two half-crowns which I produce Cross-examined Q Have you had them in your

mark on the mould was used to make the mould for the counterfeit shillings—I am confident of that—here is a tobacco-pipe which has some white metal in the bowl which appears to have been fused—here is a small piece of white metal corresponding with the counterfeit shillings—it is what is termed a get which fills up the channel of the mould—a file is used to remove the surplus metal which is now on

current shillings MESSRS PAYNE and DOANE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM GUEST police-constable L 62 On the afternoon of the 7th of October I went with three other officers to No 3 James-place St Ann-street Westminster—we found the street door open and went up stairs—there is only one room up stairs—the door was shut—I put my shoulder against it to endeavour to open it and on doing so a rush was made towards the door by persons inside pushing it back and trying to keep it closed—we ultimately succeeded in forcing it open and found all the four prisoners in the room—the moment I entered I saw Burrows go towards the window which was open and throw something white out of his hand across the court and into the open window of a house opposite and I then heard the jinking of coin falling on the floor of the room opposite—he then jumped out of the window right across the court a distance of between five and six feet into the window of the other house—I saw him stoop repeatedly in that room go towards the fire-place and throw something into the fire—he then came to the window dropped down into the court and made off—Brook followed him—I assisted in securing the other three—I left them in the care of Lupton and Goff and went into the opposite house to the room I had seen Burrows in—I there found these three counterfeit shillings on the floor two others on the hob and two in a piece of paper under an ornament on the mantel-piece—I saw melted metal running from the grate into the ashes beneath—I picked some of it up—here is part of a shilling which I picked up—I came down into the court again and between the two windows in the court I found this shilling—I then went into the room into which I originally went and found in the cupboard some plaster-of-Paris in this bag also this iron spoon which appears to have contained metal and three or four Britannia metal teaspoons HENRY LUPTON police-sergeant L 7 I went with the other policemen to this house and assisted in opening the door which was resisted by the two female prisoners—when I got into the room I saw the four prisoners there—I saw Burrows throw something from him and then jump out of the window into the window opposite—I saw that Townsend was about to take the same step and I caught him under his arm just as he was going out of the window—he called to Burrows who was in the room opposite and said Here and threw something which looked to me like shillings—I drew him back into the room and secured him—I then saw Burrows stooping or kneeling down in the room opposite picking something up and throwing it on the fire—he then jumped out of the window into the court—he fell on his back got up and was followed by Brook—I assisted to secure the other prisoners—I then searched the room and on the fire I found this spoon full of metal both red hot and a saucer on the table close to the fire containing nine shillings which I should say were bad—I also found a spoon partly melted and a small file—Temple was crying and Townsend said to her Don t fret or Don t cry they cannot hurt you —while they were waiting at the police-court Temple said he was only sorry they had not had a fight for it with the pokers and knives—Burrows said Leave the knives out not with the knives Townsend I never said any such thing Witness Yes you did CHARLES BURGESS GOFF police-constable L 83 I went to this house—Lupton had hold of Townsend as I entered the room—I saw part of a plaster-of-Paris mould on the floor close under Townsend s feet—Johnson stepped on part of it and broke it into dust—I pushed her away from it into the corner—I then picked it up—it was quite hot—I turned it over into my handkerchief and held it—I found a shilling in it which was quite hot and burnt my fingers—I found this holder lying close by the mould—it was also hot—I looked into the cupboard and found some pieces of plaster-of-Paris—I found portions of melted metal among the cinders in the fire-place—I found this knife on the table—Townsend claimed it and wished me to give it to him—I refused—here are some other pieces of plaster-of-Paris which I found about the room JAMES BROOK police-constable L 118 I went with the other witnesses—I remained outside the house—I saw Burrows jump out of the window into the window of a house opposite—I went up stairs and was making my way into the room where he was when he jumped out again into the court—I followed after him—I stopped him—he was very violent and tried to get away from me—I searched him and found a counterfeit shilling which I produce in his trowsers pocket—as I was taking him to the station some person asked him if he was got to rights—he said no they could only give him two stretch—I understood that to mean two years Burrows Q What was the reason you struck me with the handcuffs on my head A You would have got away from me—you did get away from me in the court—you were very violent before you were in custody MR PAYNE Q Did you do any thing more than was necessary to keep him from escaping A No THOMAS PARKER I am a brass and ivory turner The house No 3 James-place St Ann-street belongs to me—Johnson took the room in which the prisoners were found about a fortnight previous to the officers coming—I have seen all the other prisoners in the rcom occasionally since Johnson took it MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to the Mint and have been so a great many years All the nineteen shillings produced are counterfeit in all respects—sixteen have been cast in the same mould and three in another—here are two pieces of a plaster-of-Paris mould—on one of the pieces is part of the impression of the obverse side of a shilling and on another piece is a small portion of the impression of the reverse side—one of the shillings said to be found hot in the mould is similar to the sixteen—here are portions of metal which appear to have been fused also part of a shilling partly melted but part of the impression is on it—here are other portions of a plaster-of-Paris mould having no impression on it—here are some iron spoons which appear to have been used for the purpose of fluxing metal having white metal in them now similar to the counterfeit shillings—one iron spoon has a considerable quantity of similar metal in it now—it appears to be Britannia metal—here is part of a Britannia metal spoon the handle of which appears to have been melted and a file having white metal in the teeth which appears to have been used lor the purpose of removing the metal from the edges of the shillings which are at present unfinished—here is a small portion of plaster-of-Paris in powder similar to that which would 10rm the moulds—the other things are such as might be applied to the purposes of coining Townsend s Defence I had not been to bed on Friday night on Saturday morning between eleven and twelve o clock I went up there and asked if they would let me lie down which they did I was there three or four hoars I

coin MESSRS ELLIS and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution CALEB EDWARD POWELL I am assistant solicitor to the Mint I produce an examined copy of the record of conviction—I have compared it with the original in Mr Clark s office—it is a true copy— read JOHN SERGEANT police-constable E 65 I know the prisoner—I was present in April 1842 when he was tried and convicted of uttering a counterfeit shilling and half-crown—I am positive he is the person described in that record JAMES MOORE I am a blacksmith and live in Buckinghamshire On the 21st of Dec I was in Covent-garden market with holly to sell—the prisoner came and asked the price of it—I had never seen him before—I told him 1s a bundle—he gave me a shilling and went away with the bundle—I bit the shilling directly he was gone and found it was bad—I put it into my pocket in a bit of paper—I had no other money in that pocket—next morning the prisoner came again and asked me the price of holly—I told him 6d a bundle—he offered me a bad 5s piece—I had it in my hand and said Old man you are not going to do me the same as you done me yesterday morning —he said Did you see me yesterday morning —I said Yes and I will swear to you you gave me a bad shilling yesterday morning and now this is a bad 5s piece —he said If you don t like my money give it me again I will change it and come and pay you for your holly —he took the 5s piece out of my hand and went away—a person who stood by went and told the beadle who directly went after him down to the lower part of the market called me and I went with him—I had lost sight of him round the pillars for a minute or two—it was not above five minutes before he was taken—I had marked the crown-piece with my teeth before he had it back enough to know it again—I gave the shilling to Richard Moore Prisoner Q Was it not between nine o clock and a quarter past that I tendered this piece A I should think between nine and ten I cannot say particularly—it might be as late as half-past ten when the charge was made at the station-house—it was not twelve—at the station I pulled out a counterfeit shilling wrapped up in a piece of paper—there was no others with it—the inspector asked me how I knew it was the same shilling in taking it out with those three—I had two other bad shillings wrapped up in another piece of paper in my left hand pocket—I had taken them in the market I do not know who of—the other one was in my right pocket—I took them all three on the Thursday—when I took the first two I put them into my pocket along with other shillings not knowing they were bad—I did not put the shilling I took from you into the same pocket—I had it in my mouth and when I found it was bad I searched and found I had two more among my other money—I put those two into a bit of paper and the other in another bit—I did not bite the other two—I gave them all to the beadle at the station still wrapped up—they were shown to several at the station—they were taken out of the papers and the inspector asked me how I knew the one out of those three RICHARD MOORE I am beadle of Covent-garden market I was on duty there on Friday morning the 22nd Dec —the prisoner was pointed out to me by James Moore—as soon as he saw me he ran between two carts and I saw him put something to his mouth—Johnson another beadle first took him in my presence—when I came up he had hold of him by the collar—I then saw him pitch something from him—we struggled and all three fell on the ground together—he was then secured and taken away—I have a shilling which I received from Moore at the station—it was wrapped up in this piece of paper—he gave me two other shillings as well in another piece of paper—this was distinct from them—he took them all from one pocket—at the station I asked him if he could identify either—he said Yes the one that is wrapped up in the piece of paper by itself I bent it and marked it with my teeth —that was in the prisoner s hearing—I have kept it apart from all other coin since Prisoner Q Which pocket did the prosecutor draw the money from A The right hand breeches pocket—to the best of my knowledge he drew the three coins from one pocket—when we saw you fling something from you we did not pick it up because you threw us down—it was thrown among a bundle of holly CHARLES NYE I am a salesman in Covent-garden market I was present on this Friday and saw Johnson scuffling with the prisoner—they fell down—Johnson picked the prisoner up—Moore was also in the scuffle—I afterwards picked up a crown-piece immediately under where the prisoner lay—I took it to Bow-street and gave it to Johnson Prisoner Q Why did not you follow us down to the station with it A I did but was not admitted—I asked to see Mr Johnson—you were lying on the stones close by some holly—I took the crown-piece off the holly—it was close to where you lay—I did not put it into anybody s hands before Johnson received it FREDERICK JOHN JOHNSON I am beadle of Covent-garden market On Friday morning the 22nd of Dec the prisoner was pointed out to me by Moore and a man named Bird—he had something rubbing in his hand—I went towards him—he went between two carts standing close by at a hurried pace—I was close behind him—he put his hand to his mouth—I seized hold of him by the back of his neck and he then with his right hand pitched something from him—we had a terrible scuffle—when on the ground I put my hand to his throat and felt some hard substance pass my finger and thumb down his throat—ha swallowed it—he said What do you want —I said What you have got in your mouth —he said It is gone what can you do now —I had a further struggle with him—he seized my left hand put it into his mouth and bit my middle finger very severely—with a good deal of difficulty I got my hand out of his mouth—we got assistance and got him to the station—he was searched and four shillings and 5d in copper was found on him in good money and a bit of chalk which I have here—there is a blueish colour on one of the flat surfaces—it is broken in two pieces now—it was all in one when I had it first—it is as I took it from him except what the paper has rubbed off—I have seen the effect of rubbing metal on chalk—I produce a crown-piece which I received from Nye Prisoner Q When I ran between the carts you saw me throw something from my right hand A When I caught hold of you by the back of your neck—I did not pick it up because I thought securing you was the most necessary thing—I will not pretend to say what you threw away JAMES MOORE re-examined This is the shilling the prisoner gave me—I find a mark here that I made on it—this shilling and the other two bad ones had been in the same pocket in paper but I wrapped this in a piece of paper by itself and the other two in another piece—they were together in the two papers—I swear to the mark on this shilling—I made it when I took it—this is the crown the prisoner gave me— looking at it —I know it again by a small mark—the larger mark was made at the station—I think here is a small mark—I bit the one the prisoner offered me and there is a similar mark here—I know it is the crown the prisoner offered me by this mark I made on the edge with my teeth when I took it— showing it —I also looked at it attentively at the time and am sure it was a bad one Prisoner I should like to see him bite it again— the witness did so MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint—this crown and shilling are both counterfeit Prisoner s Defence I did tender a crown-piece to Moore but it was not a bad one for I immediately went to the White Horse nearly opposite where he was standing and had some gin and beer and had the remainder of the change in my pocket when I was taken I know nothing about the shilling I was not in the market at the time It is very strange the crown should pass through the Magistrate s hands at Bow-street and he not see the marks and that he should ask the witness why he did not mark the piece before he gave me into custody and that when I came up on the Wednesday following it should be cut and marked as you now see it he says I was not more than five minutes out of his sight whereas he owns it was about half-past nine or ten o clock that I tendered the crown to him and he cannot say whether it was not as late as twelve when we got to the station If any other person was standing at this bar he would as soon swear to him as me GUILTY Aged 21 — Transported for Ten Years

the Prosecution JAMES BRANNAN police-sergeant G 20 On the 28th of Feb from information I received I went to a house in Green-court Brick-lane St Luke s with Hull Redman and Cole—I entered at the front door went up stair to the door of the first floor room found the door fast and proceeded to force it open—I succeeded in forcing the upper part open sufficiently to be able to we into the room and saw the prisoners there—Edmeads was sitting with his face towards me and Burton was sitting sideways Edmeads holding something white in his hand and Burton holding a large spoon close to that white substance in Edmeads s hand with a pail between them—directly the door was broken open they saw me and both put their hands out as if flinging something into the nice clear fire which was burning—I did not see any thing pass from their hands—I then noticed Edmeads put something white into his mouth—it was the same white thing as I had seen in his hand—Burton went towards a cupboard in the room then came to the door and put his shoulder against the door and resisted us very much as we were still trying to force the other part of the door—at last with the assistance of the officers I forced the door open seized Edmeads by the throat and four pieces of plaster of Paris came from his mouth—I looked at the pail and noticed some melted white metal in it—Edmeads resisted very much—there was some plaster in the pail besides and water—I went to the cupboard I had seen Burton go to and found two moulds which I produce—when I first entered the room I asked Edmeads what he meant by this—he said I don t know what you mean —I said to Burton What game do you call this —he said I know nothing about it —we took them into custody and took possession of the things I now produce Cross-examined by MR ROBERTSON Q As soon as you opened the door you could see what the parties were about A Yes—directly the door was opened they removed—I crept up the stairs very gently—forcing the door made a noise—Burton put the spoon back towards the stove—I did not see him do any thing in the cupboard—I could not—his hands were white as if he had been handling some plaster—this plaster was found in the cupboard—I saw some white laying about the room—I do not recollect seeing a clothes brush—I will swear Burton had not one in his hand Edmeads Q On your oath did you come softly up stairs or run up A Very softly as quietly as I could—the very first shove I gave the door the top part came open— the witness s deposition being read at Edmeads s request agreed with his evidence JOHN HULL policeman I accompanied the other officers to this room—the door was fastened with a poker stuck into the wainscot with a staple—we burst the pannel of the door open—Burton turned round previous to our going into the room and threw something into the fire-place—Edmeads took something up which was part of this plaster of Paris mould and put it into his mouth—I saw Brannan take it out of his mouth—I found this pipkin on the fire with this iron spoon and part of the metal in it and three half-crown pieces—I also found this mug Cross-examined Q How long were you breaking open the door A I should say half a minute—they were sitting with a pail of water between them—Burton turned towards the fire threw something in then directly got up came to the door and tried to prevent our coming in—I and the other policemen were standing together—the cupboard was on the same side as the fire-place on the opposite side of the room Edmeads He said I took something up and put it to my mouth and threw something into the fire Witness I did not see Edmeads throw anything into the fire—he took up this part of a mould—his mouth was all covered with white—we went up stain softly HENRY REDMAN policeman I went to this room—when the door was partly forced open I saw Edmeads throw something into the fire—we forced the door open—Burton resisted our opening it—when we got in I saw Edmeads with something in his mouth—part of it fell—it was plaster of Paris like a mould—the other officer took possession of it—I examined the fire-place and found part of five half-crowns in the fire burning hot—I raked out some pieces of metal from the fire—I produce part of two spoons which I found on the hearth in the fender—I found this metal in the ashes—it was hot—I produce two forks which were stock in the floor with the handle of the broom against them and the other end of the broom against the door—the poker was put through the staple to fasten the door also Cross-examined Q Was there a lock to the door A Yes—the door was locked as well—Burton came to the door to prevent our coming in—I saw him standing against the fire-place when the door was partly open Edmeads Q On which side of the fire-place was I when you first saw me A I think the further side from the fire when I first saw him but the other officers were before me—I saw something in his mouth then saw him take something and throw it into the fire ROBERT COLE I accompanied the other officers to the room—I went up a few minutes after the others—I found a plaster of Paris mould for t fourpennypiece two files with metal in the teeth which is there now a pair of scissors all over plaster of Paris a little pot with some composition and a quantity of plaster of Paris Cross-examined Q You saw these things lying about the room A The scissors and one file were on the table and one file on the mantel-piece Edmeads Q How far were you from the street door when the officers went up stairs A One or two yards watching the window—they went up softly so that no one could hear them MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint This is a plaster of Paris mould intended to cast half-crowns—it bears the impression of both sides of a William IV half-crown—it appears to have been used very much—here is another plaster of Paris mould for shillings of George III 1816 which appears to have been very much used and has both sides of the impression—here are three counterfeit half-crowns all of which have been cast in the mould I have spoken to—two of them are finished and one unfinished as it comes from the mould—here are portions of two broken white metal spoons of similar metal to the half-crowns—here is some more metal which has been recently fused and here are portions of counterfeit half-crowns attached to it as if thrown into the fused metal while hot—all these half-crowns have been cast in the mould I have spoken to—scissors are generally used to separate the get from coin—this file has white metal in the teeth—it is generally used to remove any surplus metal—this iron spoon has been used to lade the metal from the pipkin—it has metal in it now—the pipkin contains similar metal—I do not know anything of this box of composition—here is some plaster of Paris the material of which the moulds are composed—these four pieces of white produced by Brannan as coming from Edmeads mouth are plaster of Paris in a solid state but have no impression on them—a pail of water could be used to immerse the moulds into immediately in cast of alarm to destroy the impression which would be done in a very short time—here is part of a mould for fourpenny-pieces but the impression is nearly obliterated Cross-examined Q It is necessary the metal should be in a fused state A Yes—they must be near enough to reach the fire to make the half-crowns—this mould is made from a good half-crown—nothing more than the articles produced is requisite to make the coin JAMES BRANNAN re-examined The fire-place was not three feet from where the prisoners sat—Burton might have reached the pipkin where he was Edmeads Defence I met Burton in Old-street be asked me if I could take him where he could brush his coat as he had been out all night I said we had no brush at my place but there was one at my mother s he accompanied me there and on going up stairs the key of the door is always left on the landing I found the room door ajar and found the room in the same state as the officers found it I just put the piece of iron in the door as it had no other fastening I had not been in the room ten minutes before I heard a dreadful crashing up the stairs and a forcing at the door before I could get to the door to open it the top panel came quite in Brannan laid hold of me but as to having plaster of Paris or mould in my mouth I swear it is false I asked him to call the landlady up he said if I said another word he would knock me down the woman who lives under the room says they came running up stairs in such a manner

after I looked in my pocket—in the interval I had not changed my money or received money from any one else—I found the 2s 4d where I had placed it and found one of the shillings to be a bad one—I put

give any account of this shilling that has been produced by May A Yes he said he had gone into a tobacconist s shop close by for a pennyworth of tobacco and gave he woman half-a-crown and took the bad shilling in change—Friendship took him to the tobacconist s shop—I was with him—what he speaks of has reference to another shilling passed at a beer shop in the New-road ANN O KEEFE I am the daughter

went with some other officers to No 8 Broad Arrow-court Milton-street St Luke s—the street door of the house was open—I went up to the front room second floor—I found that door fastened—I forced it with the assistance of the other officers—I found Henry Brown sitting on a chair in front of a clear fire—Emma Brown was sitting on his left quite close to him—Jones was sitting on a flock bed which was on the floor with a child in her arms—Henry had a mould in his left hand which he immediately threw down and rubbed under his feet—the other part went into the fire—I produce the part I picked up—on a chair on his left I found a pair of pliers a pair of scissors a hammer a knife and three gets one of which was quite hot—he immediately got up and was seized by Sergeant Brannan—he kicked and made a great resistance—he laid hold of 2s previous to being seized put them into his mouth and swallowed them—we could see him do so—Brannan seized him by the throat—the women were pulling and laying hold of him—Emma Brown said Don t kill my father —she called him father at that time and afterwards uncle—she called him a great many different names—she laid hold of him by the arm and pulled at him to get him out of our custody—after he was secured I commenced searching and just by his chair I found a complete pair of moulds used for casting counterfeit sixpences wrapped up in this piece of linen rag—in the cupboard I found a quantity of plaster of Paris which is used for making moulds—he was at that time secured—he began to use violent and shameful language—he said he had been in this country long enough he did not care a b——how soon he left it for he had been all over it before—the women were not exactly so bad but their language was very rough—I knew Jones before JAMES BRANNAN police-sergeant G 20 I went with Penny to this house in Broad Arrow-court—I seized the male prisoner by the neck directly I went in seeing him pick up some counterfeit coin from the chair on which he had sat—I held him so a considerable time—Jones came with both her hands before his chin and said Spit them out my dear the b - - policeman will choke you —he succeeded in swallowing the counterfeit shillings—the portion of the mould that he threw on the fire upset this spoon which contained some melted metal which I afterwards picked up—it fell through the grate—I produce a portion of it and the spoon three counterfeit sixpences a get and a portion of a mould with some letters on it—this is the mould which he endeavoured to stamp on while I held him by the throat—it is for casting counterfeit shillings—I produce a pipe which was stuck in the fire at the same time close by the spoon—it is used for melting I believe—the women seized me by the arm and endeavoured to turn me round and Emma said Don t choke my father Mr Brannan —she knew me well by name—I am sure the man is not her father—I know her father HENRY REDMAN police-constable G 224 I went with the other officers—I produce a file one counterfeit shilling four counterfeit sixpences and part of a mould which I took off the fire—the heat of the fire caused it to crumble—it is in pieces—there is only an impression on one piece—the women assisted in trying to get the male prisoner away from us—at the time he put the shillings into his mouth they lodged in his throat—I saw the lump—I saw he had something in his hand and in trying to get it one of his teeth caught my hand which caused me a bad hand for a week or so and from that hand this shilling dropped with a little piece of the mould—the women s language and conduct were very violent—Jones got up from a bed where she was sitting went to the mantelpiece and laid hold of something I could not see what—as soon as I succeeded in getting the hot shilling that dropped on the boards and put the male prisoner in the corner I went to the mantelpiece and from a shell there I picked out four counterfeit sixpences—that was the very corner to which Jones had gone

respects and appears to have been used for that purpose—these are four counterfeit sixpences—all of them appear to have been cast in this mould—here are also two others which have been cast in this mould and one that has not—here is a small portion of a plaster of Paris mould which appears to have been broken—it has a small part of the impression of the obverse side of a shilling on it—the three letters VIC in the word Victoria appear clearly on it—here is a counterfeit shilling of the present reign just as it comes from the mould with all the surplus metal on the edge just as it is cast—it has similar letters to those on the mould—here is a get which appears to have been produced by a mould and which fills up the channel when the metal is poured in hot—here is a small file with white metal in the teeth of it—it would be used to remove the surplus metal off the edge of the coin when cast—here is an iron spoon which might be used to melt the metal in and appears to have been so used—here is some metal which appears to have been in a state of fusion—it is white metal similar to that of which the counterfeit coin is composed—here are other tools a pair of scissors a pair of pliers and a knife which are all articles used in coining—the plaster of Paris is similar to that of which the moulds are made Henry Brown Q Do not you know a girl called Mary Allen A No I do not know

went after some money which we have for a nurse-child 3s a week during that time the woman commenced making these things I had not been out of bed for seven weeks with rheumatics when Jones came back

her her supper that night and her breakfast next morning she wanted the key of the closet she went under the pretence of going into the next room for it and during that time Jones said For God s sake get up Henry I don t like these things in the place I got up and had the mould in my hand to break it when up came the three officers the door had neither bolt nor lock nothing but a wooden button it is a complete plot and I am as innocent of it as a child I never issued a bad shilling I always got my living in the Docks Penny was talking with this woman all the morning she has had eighteen months

at eight o clock MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to the Mint and have been so for many years—I have looked at the things produced by the officers—this is a plaster of Paris mould intended for casting shillings—it has the impression of both sides of a shilling on it and appears to have been used for the purpose of casting shillings—here is a part of a plaster of Paris mould upon which there is no impression whatever—it appears to have been scraped out—this pipkin appears to have been used for the purpose of melting white metal—it contains white metal which appears to have been melted—by pouring that white metal into the mould it would produce a counterfeit feit shilling—here is a counterfeit shilling produced by one of the witnesses said to have been uttered of a similar metal to that in the pipkin—that was cast in the mould of which I have spoken—there are also four other shillings which have been cast in that mould—all five are alike counterfeit—here is a good shilling produced by one of the witnesses which appears to have made the mould in which these counterfeit shillings were cast—here is a tin band and also an oilcloth band which appears to have been used for forming the mould—it confines the plaster of Paris and is a thing usually applied for that purpose—here are twenty-three sixpences all counterfeit and appear to have been recently cast—here is plaster of Paris in powder of a similar material of which moulds are made—here is a tobacco-pipe which would be used to lade the metal from the pipkin into the mould—there is white metal in the bowl of it now

seized me As soon as the landlady saw this young woman she said You are the girl that we have got another young woman in trouble for I am quite a cripple I had my left hand in my pocket and do you think if I had four counterfeit shillings in my possession I could have passed them out of my hand with three constables by me Because I came out of that house I am to be answerable for what is found

materials capable of producing the colour of silver —3rd Count for casing over the same MESSRS ELLIS and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JAMES BRANNAN police-sergeant G 20 On the 23rd of Dec last in consequence of information I received I went to No 1 Bath-court Bath-street Shoreditch between nine and ten o clock at night—the bouse consists of two rooms one above and one on the ground floor—the outer door opens into the lower room without there being any passage and then there a staircase which takes you to the upper room—I found the outer door fastened—I knocked and the child the female prisoner opened the door—I proceeded to the staircase without saying anything to her—she rushed to the staircase before me seized me round the middle and called Father Father loud enough to be heard some distance—I pushed her away and proceeded to go up stairs leaving her below—as I was going up I met the male prisoner coming down—I was about half way up and he was about four or five stairs-above me—on seeing me he endeavoured to return back and said Brannan you have not got me to rights yet sergeant Brannan you thief —I seized hold of an apron which he were and partly turned him round as he was going up stairs again—he then jumped at me struck me with both his feet on the chest or stomach and knocked me down—the back part of my neck came against the edge of a chair in the ground-floor room and he placed his knee on my flank—the injuries which I sustained then I feel now and shall for life—at that time the officer Cole who was in the room at the time took the male prisoner off me and I directly saw a dog seize Cole by the leg I saw the little girl proceed up stairs and directly I recovered myself I followed her up and partly pushed her up stairs into the upper room I pushed her up I noticed her bending herself as if to ease something down her bosom and when I got up into the room I put my hand into her bosom and took from it this sleeve of a frock containing fourteen half-crowns which I produce—I observed a work-bench there and saw upon it a lighted candle with some apparatus—there were two earthen-ware jars with a wooden trough placed between them—these five half-crowns which I produce I found on the same work-bench near where the apparatus was—there were six but Mr Field has had one of them—I also produce four more in a similar state in different parcels and eight more in another parcel all on the same bench—I gave the apparatus into the care of Seward another constable and desired the male prisoner to be brought up—Cole brought him up—I was in the act of removing some of the bottles and the apparatus to the other end of the bench to prevent the prisoner doing any mischief—he put his hand over my shoulder picked up a bottle and smashed it over the table the contents of it burnt my hands and also Cole s—it was some burning liquid but I did not ascertain what it was—Cole pushed him back to prevent his breaking any more of the things and I saw him put his hand between his waist band and apron pull out this black bag and give it to the little girl saying Stash it Annie —the instantly put it down her bosom and begged to be allowed to go to the water-closet or else she should dirty herself—I took the black bag from her bosom directly and produce it—it contained twenty-two half-crowns and forty shillings but two of the shillings I how given to the authorities of the Mint—I secured the prisoner and have the articles up to Seward—I then proceeded down stairs and when there I saw the little girl endeavour to conceal her hand in her frock—I seized her by the hand and took from it these three counterfeit half-crowns which I produce—I then saw Cole seize her and take something from her hand—the prisoners were both taken into custody and conveyed to the station—when I first saw the male prisoner on the stairs he was without his coat and had his shirt sleeves tucked up john green I never made use of the word stash it to my child she never heard me express such a word in my life ROBBERT COLE police-constable G 193 I was with Brannan on this occasion and followed him into the house—I saw the little girl take hold of him round the waist at the same time crying out Father father —saw the male prisoner make his appearance on the stairs from above—I saw him about returning and saw Brannan take him by the apron and partly pull him round—he then made a spring struck Brannan on the breast knocked him down stairs and fell with the whole of his weight on his person—I seized the prisoner for the purpose of taking him off and succeeded in doing so when a dog instantly seized me by the leg—the little girl was about to make her way up stairs—she was followed by Branan—I and the male prisoner had a very violent struggle down below for some time—I at last succeeded in throwing him down on the floor—he then said Well I will give in I find you are too much for me and you will find the whole of the things up stairs —I proceeded with him up stairs—on entering he seized a bottle and broke it and some portion of the contents came over my hands which were burnt—I produce a half-crown which I found on the bench near the apparatus—in removing the prisoner to the further part of the room I saw him pass something to the girl which she took into her hand—I asked her what her father had given her—she said Nothing —I opened her hand and found it to contain three half-crowns which I now produce—the male prisoner was taken down stairs—I searched him at the station and found 11s 7d in good money on him JOHN SEWARD police-constable G 67 I went with the other officers and was outside the house—I went in directly afterwards and proceeded to the upper room—I there saw a work bench with some things on it which now produce—I received them from Brannan—the liquid now contained in this quart bottle was in both these basins when they were found—one I of the basins was inside the other at the time I received them from Brannan and the liquid was in the smaller and larger one too—there was also liquid in each jar which was placed in two separate bottles on the Saturday following and given to Mr Field—the jars had been in my care in the mean time—I am sure the liquid I gave to Mr Field was the liquid that was in the jars—the contents of one jar were placed in one bottle I and the contents of the other in another bottle ALLEN CAMERON police-constable N 91 I was with the other officers on the 23rd and followed them into the house—I was left in charge I after the prisoners were taken away—I went up stairs into the room from I which the prisoner was taken and under the bed I found this wire and I behind the door I found this sand—this file and this metal I found down stairs MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint I have examined all the coins produced—there are sixty-one half-crowns all of them counterfeit—when I first saw this paper it contained six half-crowns one of them I handed over to Mr Smee for the purpose of making some experiments upon it—all the six had undergone the process of electrosilvering—the surface of the coins is silver produced by the electrogal-vanic process—I am sufficiently familiar with that process to be able to state that—here are thirty-eight counterfeit shillings—there were forty when I first saw them—I gave two of them to Mr Smee—I believe the half-crown was given to him by Brannan—one of the coins produced by Cole is in the state in which it first comes out of the battery as the apparatus is generally called—a great number of the coins have not undergone the process—they are composed of Britannia metal which is generally a mixture of tin and antimony—the whole of the coins are counterfeit and are all in different stages of the process—here are two galvanic batteries made after the construction recommended by Mr Smee—when first saw these batteries each of them contained fluid—these are what Cole pointed out as jars—by my direction the fluid was taken out of these two jars and placed in two bottles which I afterwards numbered 1 and 2 —the other bottles produced by Seward also marked 3 4 5 and 6 —they were delivered up to me at the office of the Solicitor of the Mint on Saturday the 28th of Dec for the purpose of having experiments made on them and on the Monday following I placed them in the hands of Mr Smee who in my presence made experiments on the fluids contained in the bottles 3 4 and 5 and we found that they contained what had the appearance of silver by the test—I also saw two basins containing what I believe to be sand and water the contents of which by my direction were placed in this quart bottle—I do not know what experiments Mr Smee made on the contents of No 1 and No 2—the whole of the articles produced I believe to be complete for the purpose of performing the process of electro-silvering—the electrosilvering would give that appearance to the coins which the perfect ones have—this wire I belongs to the battery—they are the conducting wires—sand is used for robbing the coins when they appear in this dull state to make them appear as some of the coins do that are here now in the more bright and finished state—that would prepare them for the electrosilvering and remove this dead colour afterwards—the metal that was found down stairs appears to be Britannia metal similar to the coins as far as I can judge of it—I here is a broken wine-glass ALFRED SMEE I am a surgeon I have examined these batteries and all the apparatus have present—these two batteries are oh the contruction of which I am the inventor—altogether they form a complete apparatus for covering the surface of metal by precipitating it into a solution and with this apparatus—I have coated two half-crowns with the silver out of these solutions and with this apparatus—the solutions marked 3 4 5 and 6 contain silver—you put the substance to be coated in another vessel apart from the battery—this vessel was probably used for that purpose—if you place in this vessel any of the solutions 2 3 4 5 of 6 and connect that to the battery you can deposit a film of silver on the base metals—these are the two half-crowns which I so coated by using the articles produced by the officers and nothing else not even a drop of distilled water besides—I did it with these very things without any addition whatever—I have one half-crown which was given me I think by Brannan yesterday—he put a mark on it at the time that he might know it again—I have taken off the coating of silver from that and on applying chemical reagents to the solution of the salt I found it to be silver unequivocally—the coin itself is white metal which is very fusible probably tin and antimony Britannia metal—it will fuse in a glass vessel—here is part of one of the shillings so fused John Green s Defence When Brannan pulled me down he pulled me on the top of him and that was the cause of his being hurt I did not kick him I always got my living by shoemaking which my friends can prove I never did any thing of this kind myself they were left in my place for a trap Edward Richard Dean printer No

moulds intended for counterfeiting penny pieces MESSRS SCRIVEN and WILDE conducted the Prosecution CHARLES BURGESS GOFF police-constable L 83 On Sunday the 20th of April between one and two o clock I saw the prisoners Blundell and Jemima Wilson at the station-house and while there I saw Blundell put something into his mouth which he appeared to swallow with great difficulty—I said they should be searched—the female prisoner was taken to the back of the station-house by the female searcher who afterwards returned and said Jemima Wilson had two keys which she refused to give up—I said they would be taken from her if she did not—she then produced them—I went to No 10 Eaton-street New-cut Black-friars-road with Romain a constable and there found the prisoner Ann lying on the floor between the bedstead and cupboard—as we went into the room Romain turned his light on—she looked up and said I thought it was my sister come and asked where she was—I said She is locked up at the station you had better get up and dress yourself —Romain took a candle off the bedstead and lighted it—I saw something white in the cupboard and found a mould there which I produce—I found a file on the same shelf five counterfeit penny pieces and this bag with Robson plaster-of-Paris manufacturer Mount-pleasant on it—I found some pieces of metal in the cupboard called gets which fit the mould and some pieces of run metal among the cinders under the fire-place—I found some more pieces of plaster-of-Paris between the stove and the wall—there were small splashes of white metal in the front of the stove and about the bars—I said to Ann Wilson I have found a mould and several counterfeit coins here you must go to the station —she said I do not live here it is my sister s room I live at No 12 and will show you —I tried the keys to the door and found both of them locked and unlocked the room door—it was not fastened when I went in—I asked Ann how she got in—she said she burst the door open to lie down as her sister was out—I went with her to No 12—she pointed out the back parlour on the ground floor as her room—as we went in she said something I did not understand but she seemed surprised that there was no furniture there—the room was empty—I examined the fire-place and behind it and under it in the ashes I found these pieces of plaster-of-Paris which appear like broken moulds—the floor before the hearth was loose—I took up four boards went under the flooring and found this broken pipkin which appears to have burst on the fire as the metal appears to have flown from it—there are portions of metal in it—I found other pieces of plaster-of-Paris under the floor—as I was tying them up Ann said I know nothing of them —I found one key locked and unlocked the door of No 12 but not the other WILLIAM ROMAIN policeman I accompanied the witness on the 20th of April shortly after one o clock in the morning—the door was shut—we shoved against it and it went open—we went up to the first floor back room—the door was shut but not fastened—it had been burst open—Ann Wilson said she did not live there she had burst the door open to get in to sleep—I found on the mantle-piece this mould some blue-stone and in the cupboard a saucer with some lead-pipe and a piece of broken mould—this shovel was on the coals at the bottom of the cupboard with this metal in it—here are marks at the back as if it had been on the fire—we went to No 12 with Ann Wilson—she said that was the room she rented but she had moved her things out the previous day—next day I accompanied the prisoners to the Magistrate—Ann said on the road all the trouble she had got into Blundell and her sister had brought her into—this was not in the other prisoners hearing HONORA HANCOCK I am the wife of Thomas Hancock of No 10 Eaton-street—my huband rents Nos 10 and 12—the female prisoners came to me nine weeks before they were taken—Ann took the room No 12 and the other No 10 where I live—Blundell was not with them then—Jemima took the room at No 10 for herself and husband who she said was a baker s man—I gave her the key and in three days after he came to live there—I saw him up and down coming to and fro as a man would do at his own place—I saw Ann Wilson at No 10 coming in and out to the other prisoners room—she occupied my room at No 12 for nine weeks before she was apprehended—they were not both taken at the same time—Jemima took No 10 four weeks after Ann took No 12—they both came together to take No 12 and about four weeks after Jemima took No 10—Ann paid the rent of 12 and Jemima of No 10 but the last time the man paid 9d which he said was on account of rent—I gave the key of No 12 to Ann and that of No 10 to Jemima—I thought Ann slept at No 12 but do not know whether there was a bed there Blundell Q When did I pay you the last money A The very day you was taken about four o clock on Saturday evening—I did not see you go out at the time and cannot recollect whether you had your things on to go out MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint—this plaster-of-Paris mould found at No 10 is intended and has been used to cast counterfeit penny pieces and has impressions of both sides of a penny piece—here are five counterfeit penny pieces which have been cast in it three of them have the gets attached to them—I have applied them to the mould and they fit it—they would have to be colpured by means of a solution of sulphate of copper before they are circulated—a pair of scissors is generally used to remove the gets and afterwards a file to take off the surplus metal—here is a file with white metal in the teeth of it and some pieces of white metal similar to the counterfeit coin several of them in the forms of gets—here is some plaster-of-Paris which appears to have been a mould but has no impression on it now—here is a mould found at No 12 with the impression of both sides of a farthing on it—here is some white metal lead and pewter similar to the metal in the shovel—I believe the coins to be Britannia metal and pewter—I cannot tell exactly—the metal in the shovel appears of a similar description and to have been fused in this shovel—here is a pipkin which appears to have been used to fuse in white metal and some broken pieces of plaster without any impressions upon them—they appear to be parts of moulds Blundell put in a written defence stating that he left his room on the morning in question and met a man named Willis and his wife who asked permission to stop in his room till the evening that he gave them the key that ht

police-sergeant S 3 I was present at the prisoner s trial in Sept 1844—I am positive he is the person THOMAS HENRY TARLTON I am secretary to the Young Men s Christian Association in Sergeant s-inn Fleet-street On Saturday the 13th of Dec about one o clock the prisoner came to our office to purchase three tickets of admission to a course of lectures then in process of delivery to young men—I told him they were 1s each—he asked first if they were any price at all and when I informed him the price he asked if I could give him change for a sovereign—I said Yes and put the change 17s on the desk—he drew an apparent sovereign out of his pocket folded up in paper—I found it was counterfeit and charged him with having tendered me a base sovereign—he denied all knowledge of its being base and said his master a bookseller at Hackney had given it to him—I told him unless he could give me evidence that he had been sent by the party he named I should detain him till I sent for a policeman—he did not and a policeman was fetched—he then acknowledged the sovereign was bad—I delivered it to Noble the policeman ISAAC NOBLE City police-constable No 318 I was called to Sergeant s-inn on the 13th of Dec and the prisoner was given into my custody by Mr Tarlton from whom I received this bad sovereign—I searched the prisoner and found on him some pamphlets two good shillings and three halfpence but no other bad money FREDERICK WILLIAM LARGE I am errand-boy at the Marylebone Literary Institution On the 3rd of Dec last I saw the prisoner at the library of the Institution—he asked me for a ticket for Mr Russell s entertainments the price of which was 2s —he gave me a counterfeit half-sovereign—I saw at once that it was bad—I took it to Mr Bingley the secretary and by his direction went for a policeman—I left the half-sovereign with him after making a mark on it—I found Doherty the policeman who came and took the prisoner into custody—on my return Mr Bingley gave me the same halfsovereign I had given him and I gave it to Doherty—the prisoner was taken before a Magistrate the following morning and discharged JAMES BINGLEY On the 3rd of Dec I received a half-sovereign from Large—I remarked that it was bad—I retained it in my possession a short time and then gave it back to him—I am sure I gave him the one I got from him JAMES DOHERTY police-constable D 51 On the 3rd of Dec I took the prisoner into custody at the Institution—I received from Large a counterfeit half-sovereign which I took to the station and gave it to sergeant Sheppy—he returned it to me on the 17th of Dec and I produce it Prisoner Q You and Large were absent from the station two or three minutes by the advice of the inspector where did you go to A To a public-house on the other side of Oxford-street to weigh it—the landlady weighed it and it was not weight at all THOMAS SHEPPEY police-sergeant D 19 I received a counterfeit halfsovereign from Doherty on the 3rd of Dec —I put it into the desk along with other counterfeit coin but am certain there was no other half-sovereign—I returned it to Doherty on the 17th of Dec —I can swear I gave him the same I received from him WILLIAM WOOD I am schoolmaster to the Society for teaching the blind in Queen-square Bloomsbury On the 11th of Dec last the prisoner came to the Society s premises there for a report and he purchased an embossed copy of the Acts of the Apostles—the cost of that is 3s 9d to a bookseller and I charged him that as he said he came from Mr Williams a bookseller—he tendered a sovereign in payment—I said it felt rather curious—it was very smooth—I struck it on the desk and asked a blind boy close by me what it sounded like—he said in the prisoner s presence that it was a shilling—I then compared it with a shilling and finding it was not a shilling gilt I felt more convinced of its goodness and gave the prisoner 16s 6d change and he gave me 3d —I packed the book up in brown paper at his request tied it and wrote the name of Williams on it with the selling price—I placed the sovereign in a tin-box which I have for the purpose—there was one other sovereign in it which was very bright and sharp in the impression—it was decidedly a good one and very different from the one I took from the prisoner—it remained in the tin box till about half-past one next day—I then gave it to Malcolm who guides our pupils to take to change—I am quite certain I gave him the sovereign the prisoner gave me—I was not certain of it at the time till Malcolm came back and then I looked into the tin box and found the bright one still there—the one I had given Malcolm was very dull and very smooth and the other was very bright and sharp—I took it to the solicitor of the Mint on the 22nd—I kept possession of it and produce it now—I have kept it entirely separate from other money since JOHN MALCOLM On the 12th of Dec last I received from Mr Wood a piece which I considered was a sovereign but I never looked at it—I took it to a shop to get change and when I threw it on the counter the man told me it was bad—I returned it to Mr Wood—I am positive I returned him the same piece I got from him for it was never out of my sight Prisoner Q By what means do you know it to be the same A I had no other sovereign and only two sixpences—I had nothing of that kind or colour about me MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to Her Majesty s Mint and have been so many years This half-sovereign first produced is counterfeit—the first sovereign produced is counterfeit and the second also and both have been cast in the same mould—they are precisely alike in all respects Prisoner Q Why do you state that A I have examined them both very accurately and I have no doubt whatever they were produced from the same mould—there is an identical mark about each sovereign—at the front of the neck there is a small projection which should not be in a good one and if the Jury look at the other and compare them together they will find the same identical mark there—it is an Accidental mark in the mould itself—the two correspond exactly—there are several other things about them Prisoner In the expectation of being found guilty I hope to receive the mercy of the Court GUILTY Aged 25 — Transported for Ten Years Before Mr Justice Wightman 
t18460202-482  482 THOMAS RUSSELL ANN RUSSELL and JAMES SCOTT were indicted for feloniously making two counterfeit shillings MESSRS BODKIN and ELLIS conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM PENNY police-inspector G On the 28th Jan about half-past four in the afternoon I went with Brannan Cole and two other officers to a house in John s-buildings St Ann-street Westminster—I tried the door and could not open it—I consider it was locked—I then forced it open with the assistance of the other officers—the house consists of two rooms—we went to the upstairs room and found that door fast—I found it was fastened with this wooden cross-bar across the door—this larpe piece of timber about eight feet long was fitted into it and went in a slanting direction to the wall—the door was broken open by Brannan with a sledge-hammer—as soon as a piece of the door was knocked out I had a full view of the room—I saw Thomas Russell throw a quantity of shillings into a large clear fire—I could see they were shillings—the prisoners were in the room—Ann Russell had a mould in her hand at the time which she put into a pail of water in front of the fire and squeezed it—the door then came in and we rushed in—I put my hand into the pail of water and took out a shilling and some plaster of Paris which she had in her hand—I then commenced searching the room—under the bed by the I found a paper parcel containing plaster of Paris in powder and this knife on the floor close to the fire with plaster of Paris on it—on a kind of dressershelf I found this galvanic battery in a jar containing fluid which in the affray was accidentally upset—I had it in my hand before it was shirt and it was quite full—the male prisoners had their coats off and their shirt sleeves rolled up—I did not see Scott till I entered the room—he was in the corner of the room where the bed was—when I entered Thomas Russell was Just in front of the fire and Scott was in a kind of place where the bed was—Russell had a handkerchief tied round his head—I ascertained the state of the door after I got in—I produce the things I found Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Had you any search-warrant A No—I did not expect to find a galvanic battery—I had arranged beforehand the time to go—I had not been in communication with any one for a few days before this nor at all only with the Mint authorities—I had not been speaking to any private individual relating to this case—I had had an interview with the authorities of the Mint about ten or eleven o clock in the morning of this day—I was informed of the time at which I was to go—I took the sledge-hammer by my own arrangement—I anticipated fastenings both to the outer door and to the room up stairs—there always are on these occasions—I did not expect the bars nor had I any idea of finding a galvanic battery—I was not informed who would be there—I expected Russell and his wife or the woman that passed as his wife would be there—I had not been in communication with anybody from the house recently before this nor ever in my life nor was I ever near the house before—I had never seen this bag of plaster of Paris till I brought it away—I had never seen Ann Russell before—I expected to find the man and his wife in the room from the information I had received—the information I received was from Her Majesty s Mint—I expected from the information I received that if I went there at half-past four I should find Russell and his wife manufacturing bad shillings—it was considered that would be about the hour they would be at work making this counterfeit money—no stranger or private individual was introduced to me on the subject—I would not have spoken to a private individual about it—I believe the information came to me first—I have letters to attend at the Mint occasionally—I think it was Brannan that went first to the Mint Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Who went into the room first A I and Brannan went in abreast as the door came open—Brannan could not see so much as I did because he was breaking the door at the time—we had equal opportunities of seeing when we went in—we were all together—it was a very small place—we left one officer outside but he was up in the room in moment afterwards—I saw Scott the moment I went in—I had the galvanic battery in my hand as I was searching about the place and it was accidentally upset as I was stooping—some of the stuff went on my shoes and I was afraid it would burn me—it was a kind of yellow stuff—it was all spilt but I have a sample of it in a bottle Q How long ago is it you first heard anything about this man and his wife A Upwards of fourteen months—I have been to all parts of London after them COURT Q How many of the shillings appeared to be thrown into the fire A I should say a handful—part of them ran through the grate—I expect part of them went into a saucepan which was on the fire full of metal in a fluid state—there was about 15lbs —I could see they were shillings—I was not so far off as I am from the bench—I had a great piece out of the door and I had a full view JAMES BRANNAN police-sergeant G 20 I accompanied Penny and other officers to this house—I broke open the door with a sledge-hammer-after I had broken a panel out I could see into the room and I noticed the female prisoner with something white in her hand which I believe to be a mould—her hand was in a pail of water—I also saw Russell and both his hands were covered with plaster—I succeeded in breaking the door open I should say not half a minute after a very short time indeed—I went up to the woman—the took her hand out of the pail of water—I took hold of her hand and found in it this piece of plaster with some metal—it was very hot—she at the same time dropped this shilling out of the same hand on a table—it was covered with plaster—the shilling was cold but the plaster and metal very hot—I took possession of them—Thomas Russell was also standing at the pail at the time I gained access—I immediately seized and secured him and gave him over to Turpin—the fire was large and clear—this iron saucepan was on it—it contains from 12lbs to 15lbs of metal which was in a fluid state—i found a quantity of white metal which I produce not inside the fender but just in the corner of the chimney jamb—I did not take any notice of Scott Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You took a sledge-hammer with you A I did—I have been engaged in matters of this sort before—I have taken a sledge-hammer before but have not used it—I expected there would be barring of doors not of the lower door—there were no bars to the lower door—it was shut—the resistance I found I expected—I expected to find coming implements—I did not expect to find a galvanic battery—I cannot say what I expected to find—I cannot say whether I expected to find a galvanic battery—I had not been informed there was a galvanic battery that I swear positively—I received information from the solicitor to the Mint—I had parted with him that morning—he wrote to me at first in the usual way—I had no information from any private individual—the letter stated the time at which we were to go—I do not think I have that letter by me—I have three or four letters from Mr Powell—my time was appointed—the letter said nothing about a galvanic battery nor did it say they would be at work at half-past four o clock—no time was fixed—we were to remain in attendance—we remained in attendance about an hour and a half—we were at the Green Man public-house close to Westminster Sessions-house and there I staid till about half-past four—nobody came to tell me all was ready—I watched a certain signal which was a chalk mark on the iron gate before the Westminster Sessions-house—when the chalk mark was made I was to go—I did not see anybody make the chalk mark—I was in the public-house and I went backwards and forwards to the place to are if the mark was there and when it was I proceeded with the other officers to the place named—the arrangement was that I was to wait till I saw the mark on the gate—I did so and then proceeded forthwith—that arrangement was a communication from Mr Powell—my information stated there would be a chalk mark made—I do not know that this inquiry has been set on foot by an old offender—I do not know who gave the information—I think it comes from somebody that must know something about it—I cannot say whether he has been convicted or not because I do not know the person COURT Q What other persons were there in the house A In that apartment only the three prisoners—I saw nobody but them in the house ROBERT COLE police-constable G 4 I accompanied Penny and the others and found the prisoners in the room—I was present when Brannan broke open the door and I followed the officers into the room—I took charge of the female prisoner—she was taken from a pail that was standing before the fire by Brannan and given into my custody—while in my custody I perceived she had something in her hand—I saw some plaster of Paris some metal and a shilling taken from her hand by Brannan—I found on a table standing before the fire a small file with a small portion of white metal in its teeth—under the grate I found various pieces of metal—one is a round piece bearing somewhat a resemblance to a shilling—it appears to have been melted—I found a box in the room at the foot of the bed and in two separate parcels thirteen large Britannia-metal spoons—I have produced all that I have mentioned HENRY TATE police-constable G 136 I accompanied Penny and the others—when I got into the room I seized Scott—he was stooping before the fire—I secured him with the others—in front of Scott I saw this ladle with metal in it in a fluid state—I found this plaster of Paris in a paper bag in the room and this pair of scissors on a chair close by where Scott was standing HENRY TURPIN police-constable G 119 I accompanied the other officer on this occasion—I produce two spoons which I found on the chimney-piece and a bason with some plaster of Paris in a bag HENRY BELLAMY I keep the house in John s-buildings St Ann-street where the officers went I am a labouring man at a gas factory—I know the room the officers broke into—the prisoners Thomas and Ann Russell lived there—the female took the room in the early part of Aug —they continued to occupy it down to the time of the officers coming—I know Scott try sight—I never saw him on the premises—I have seen him about the neighbourhood and have passed him once twice or thrice a week—I have no farther knowledge of him Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did the female take the room as the wife of the man A Yes and has lived with him ever since as his wife—I was never in their room since they have occupied it until I heard the constables making a noise up stairs—I then went in—I knew nothing of their proceedings—Scott did not reside there—I am out all day from half-past five or six o clock in the morning till half-past five or six at night—I know nothing about what visitors came—I am married—my wife is not here—I never noticed any person go up or come down—I occupy the other room myself MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin to her Majesty s Mint Looking at the articles produced —this is a counterfeit cast shilling in an unfinished state and appears just as it comes from the mould when first cast—here is another counterfeit shilling in the same state with the get at tached to it—here are a variety of other articles which I have examined all applicable to the means of casting counterfeit money by a mould made of plaster of Paris—this metal appears to be Britannia metal which it what is generally used—here is some metal which has been fused and among it appears something like the impression of a shilling partly melted COURT Q What has the galvanic battery to do with it A It has nothing to do with the coining of money—it might be employed for the purpose of plating the counterfeit money after it is cast but it might be employed for other purposes as well—the expense of plating money by such meant it very trifling—I have seen a great quantity of counterfeit money covered by means of a galvanic battery—it is most generally done so now—it is what is called electro-plating JAMES BRANNAN re-examined I cannot say whether the landlord or landlady were at home when we went—we rushed up stairs so quickly it it impossible for me to say—the landlord came into the room afterwards while we were there HENRY BELLAMY re-examined I was not at home when the officers came nor was my wife—she goes out to her daily work—I had no servant or anybody on my premises except the prisoners THOMAS RUSSELL— GUILTY Aged 29 SCOTT— GUILTY Aged 32 Transported for

tried MARY COOPER I am bar-maid at the Royal Pavilion Vauxhall-road On Wednesday evening the 11th of Feb a little after six o clock the prisoner came to the bar with another man—I had never seen him before—he asked for change for a sovereign—he offered me a good sovereign—I noticed that it was good—he laid it on the counter—I gave him a half-sovereign and 10s change—I am sure the half-sovereign I gave him was a good one—I had noticed it that afternoon—the prisoner then asked me for a glass of porter which came to 1d —I gave it him—he asked his companion to pay for it—he did so—he then turned to me and said Then will you give me my sovereign back again —I gave him the sovereign and as I took up the halfsovereign and threw it into the till it fell lightly—I knew it was a bad one—I took it off the counter—I did not see how it came on the counter—he had plenty of time to change it while I turned my back for the glass of porter—I did not see him touch the change—when it fell into the till Mr Mackwinnie who was standing by me instantly took it up and gave him in charge—there was no other half-sovereign in the bowl—there are three separate bowls—I marked the half-sovereign at the police station Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Were both these persons given into custody A Yes—I had not myself received the half-sovereign that I gave the prisoner in change—my mistress had put it into the till—I did not see it put in—I saw it in the till—it was the only half-sovereign there—the first occasion on which I had occasion to use it was when the prisoner came in for change—my mistress is well and is now at home MR ELLIS Q Had you noticed the half-sovereign in the till before you gave to the prisoner A Yes—it is a rule for me to get the gold changed for silver before we are busy but I did not do so on this occasion as there was only a sovereign and a half in the till—I took them both up and they were good—I did not ring them ANDREW MACKWINNIE I am son-in-law of the owner of the Royal Pavilion On Wednesday the 11th of Feb about six o clock in the evening I was in the bar parlour—the prisoner and another man came to the bar—the prisoner asked the barmaid if she could give him change for a sovereign—she said Yes —I saw her give him 10s in silver and a half-sovereign—I afterwards saw a half-sovereign and some silver lying on the counter—I did not see Cooper take it up—I had noticed the half-sovereign that was in the till in the afternoon and noticed that it was good—I heard the half-sovereign that was returned fall into the till and I noticed by the sound that it was bad—the prisoner was given into custody with his companion—I kept the halfsoverign and gave it to the policeman—I have occasion to go to the till to notice the money that is taken and the quantity and that day I took very Particular notice of the money taken and I know there was a good sovereign and a good half-sovereign in the till Cross-examined Q Did you ring it A No I did not but I could tell it was good without sounding it CHARLES ROOPE EWART I am an ironmonger and live in Shaftesbury-terrace Pimlico—on the 7th of Feb the prisoner came to my shop about twelve o clock in the day and asked

my apprentice in the shop—I got from my cash-box a good half sovereign and 9s —I brought it down counted it before the prisoner and laid it on the counter—I am quite sure the half-sovereign I brought down was a good one—a boy came in with the prisoner and when I had counted out the change to the prisoner the boy immediately said he wanted a knife—he had said nothing about wanting a knife before—I turned round with my back to the counter to get a paper of knives—the prisoner immediately pushed a half-sovereign to me and said he did not like the look of it—that was a bad half-sovereign—it was not the half-sovereign I had put down—I said the one I laid down was a good one I could not conceive how it was a bad one yet I saw it was but I could not have a piece of work with him because my wife was ill up stairs and therefore I put up with the loss and gave him the change—the boy paid for his knife and they went away—I kept the half-sovereign apart from other money and afterwards gave it to Cripps the policeman—I first of all showed it to different tradesmen Cross-examined Q Had you ever seen the prisoner before A No JOHN CRIPPS police-constable B 157 I was called to the Royal Pavilion on the evening of the 11th of Feb and found the prisoner and another man there—I took them into custody by desire of Mr Mackwinnie for ringing the changes and giving a bad half-sovereign to the bar-maid—they made no observation—I conveyed them both to the station and found on the prisoner a good sovereign and a ring—he told me he lodged at No 2 Carpenter s-buildings Back-fields—I went there searched the room and found this counterfeit guinea wrapped up in paper on the chimney-glass—in consequence of something that reached me afterwards I went to Mr Evans and received from him this sovereign which I produce—this other halfsovereign I received from Mr Macwinnie—I found no half-sovereign on the other man Mr JOHN FIELD I am an inspector of counterfeit coin to the Royal Mint—these two half-sovereigns are both counterfeit in all respects—this guinea is also counterfeit Cross-examined Q How are the half-sovereigns made A They are cast in Britannia metal and electro-gilt—they may be easily detected by sound or weight but not by sight COURT Q Are both the half-sovereigns from the same mould A No one is dated 1842 and the other 1844—the date of the guinea is 1795—that is brass gilt GUILTY Aged 27 — Transported for Seven Years

draper in the Commercial-road On the 28th of April between three and four o clock in the afternoon the prisoner came into the shop for change for a sovereign—I gave him half a sovereign and 10s in silver half-crowns I think but I cannot be certain they were all half-crowns—I can swear the half-sovereign I gave him was good for I had weighed it only ten minutes before—it was with other gold but I had no other half-sovereign—I am certain it was full weight—there is a ledge which projects from the desk I put the change there—I gave the half-sovereign first and while I was looking out the silver he said I don t like the looks of this half-sovereign —he put it on the ledge again—I said If you object to it I will give you silver for it I am certain it is good —I gave him silver for it and put the half-sovereign which I received from him into the till again where there was no other half-sovereign—he walked out and Francis Reader came in immediately—In consequence of what he said I looked at the till and examined the sovereign I bad received from him which I had put into the same till—it was good but the half-sovereign was counterfeit—there was but that one half-sovereign—I could tell it by the weight of it and the appearance altogether—I only weighed it in my hand and I had bad weighed the other in the scales—Reader went to get a constable and brought back Frazer K 121 with the prisoner—I marked the half-sovereign and gave it to Frazer—the prisoner said did I wish to charge him with passing a half-sovereign—I said Yes —he asked me to let him look at it—I said No certainly not —he said rather than have any noise about it if I would give it him he would give me 10s for it—I refused Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Does any other person serve in the shop besides you A Yes several—I took the sovereign up and put it into the till and gave him silver without further investigation though he told me he did not like the look of it—I did not discover that it was light when I took it up from being so certain before DONALD FRAZER police-constable if 121 On the 21st of April I was called by Reader —in conseguence of what he said I took the prisoner in charge—I got a half-sovereign from Eliza Whitmore which I produce—I searched the prisoner at the station which is about one-eigbth of a mile from where I took him—I found on him 20s in silver all good but no half-sovereign—I took him about fifty yards from the shop—I had seen him come of the shop—I took him to the station—I did not search him till there ELISABETH WHITMORE My husband is a haberdasher we live in Portland-place Cambridge-heath Bethnal-green On Tuesday the 28th of April about half-past two o clock in the afternoon the prisoner came to the shop and asked for a shirt collar which came to 6d —he gave me a sovereign—I had not change and gave it to the little girl to go in the neighbourhood and get it—he saw that and after the child was gone he said he hoped she would not bring all silver—I said Most gentlemen prefer silver and if you object to it I can give you half a sovereign —the little girl returned with all silver—in consequence of what passed between me and the prisoner I took 10s of the change and proceeded to get the half-sovereign from the cash-box which was in a little shop parlour adjoining the shop—I found a lialf-sovereign iu the cash-box—I only bad that one in the house—I had taken it myself the evening before and had examined it—it was a remarkably bright one quite new—I weighed it in the scales—it was a vtry good one—I gave it to him and after giving it him I turned round to put the silver into the cash-box—I turned my back to him and when I turned round again he said This is a bad half-sovereign and gave me a half-sovereign which I am sure was not the same which I had given him—I said A bad one —he said Yes —I said Well it is very strange it was good last night and I am sure it was good when I gave it to you —it was not td bright as the one I had given him and I saw at once it was not the same—I told him so—I took up my scales and weighed it before him—it was a very bad one indeed—he said it was the same I had given him—he had one glove on his left hand and the other glove twisted round one of his fingers—this raised my suspicion—I requested him to take his gloves off—he said he felt himself very much insulted—he took off his gloves and shook them both—I do not think I took hold of them myself—he said he was sorry he had come into the shop at all but took notice of my name on the shop and left—as soon as he left I went to Mr Whale a neighbour and showed him the half-sovereign—he went in pursuit of the prisoner—I followed and met him bringing the prisoner back—I said to him This is a bad half-sovereign you have given me I am sure —he said give it to him again half a sovereign was of no consequence to him—I gave it him he put it into his mouth directly and gave me four half-crowns—I allowed him—to go—I had given him the 10 back when he said it was a bad half-sovereign and was left with the bad half-sovereign and nothing for it at first—he was not dressed as he if now—I think he had a blue frock coat on—his appearance was very respectable—her had a cane with a silver head Cross-examined by MR BRIERLY Q You are quite certain you cannot be mistaken in the person A Quite—I looked particularly at him—I never saw a person put money into his mouth before when he was waiting to receive change—I am quite sure I had not another half-sovereign—it was about twenty minutes to three o clock when I met him coming back GEORGE WHALE I am a cheesemonger and live near Mrs Whitmore—Mrs Whitmore came to my shop about half-past two o clock and showed me a half-sovereign which was very bad—in consequence of what she said I went out and about 200 yards on the Cambridge Heath-road overtook the prisoner—I asked him if he had been into a shop to buy a collar—he said yes—I said he had passed a half-sovereign there they did not approve of—I asked him to step back with me—he said Yes certainly —as we went back we met Mrs Whitmore—I saw him receive the bad half-sovereign from her and give her good silver—he put it to his mouth—whether he took it out again I do oot know—he went away—I met Mr Cane a neighbour a plumber and glazier—I told him and we followed him about half a mile nearly to Cleveland-street—he went in a direction towards the Commercial-road—I lost sight of him in Mile-end-road—I did not notice him do anything as he went along— Cane came back with me—we met Reader who said he would follow him and we left Cross-examined Q Are you quite sure he is the same person A Quite by his features—his whiskers have been taken off since I think—he said I don t value the half-sovereign and put it to his lips—persons do not often put money in their mouths—I have not seen it done very frequently FRANCIS READER I live in Cleveland-street Mile-end-road On the 28th of April at twenty minutes to three o clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoner and Whale and a policeman near my house—I went up to them—something was said about his having passed a bad half-sovereign—he was allowed to go—in consequence of what I heard I followed the prisoner—I saw him join a man and woman at the Blind Beggar public-bouse in Whitechapel-road about 300 yards from where I first saw him—they were together about eight minutes then parted company—the prisoner went towards Whitechapel-church—the man and woman went in an opposite direction—I and a policeman followed him into the Commercial-road—the man and woman had joined him again on the opposite side of the public-house—they went about half a mile together towards Limehouse—they were in the Commercial-road together—that policeman left me and Frazer another policeman joined me—the prisoner left the man and woman and went into Roberta s shop—the man and woman went on by the door—on the prisoner coming out I went into the shop and made inquiry—the man and woman were about 200 yards from the shop at that time—in consequence of what was told me in the shop I came out and pointed the prisoner out to Frazer—he pursued him and took him into custody a very short distance from the shop—he had not got up to the other two but had gone in the same direction JOHN FIELD I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint This half-sovereign is counterfeit in all respects—the composition of it is white metal not platina—it is Britannia metal—the gravity of it is about 8 to 19 as compared to gold—platina weighs rather more than a half-sovereign—this does not weigh so much by half Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Would there be any difficulty in a person finding it out as soon as they took it up A I should think it very easily indeed GUILTY — Transported for

the G division of police On Wednesday the 6th of May between four and five o clock in the afternoon in company with other officers I went to a house in New-court Duck-lane Westminster—I went up stairs to the front room second floor and found the door fastened inside and out—I was provided with hammers and implements to break open doors—these two large logs of wood were placed against the door inside and it was fastened outside by two bolts one at top and one at the bottom and two planks about two and a half inches thick which reached from top to bottom were nailed outside the door to give it the appearance of an uninhabited place—we broke it down in an instant with our implements and saw the prisoner there alone—I had four officers with me—as soon as I entered the room I saw the prisoner standing by a large clear fire—in her right hand she had a large plaster of Paris mould in her left this large iron spoon containing white metal in a fluid state—she put the spoon on the hearth and at the same time lai d hold of a counterfeit half-crown with a get attached to it off the mantel-piece and put it into the iron spoon which was quite hot and the metal was in a fluid state—she at the same time dashed the mould on the floor and commenced stamping upon it with her feet—Brannan then secured her—I produce three Britannia metal spoons which I found upon the mantel-piece one partly melted a file the teeth of which were foil of metal that was on the mantel-piece also a piece of white metal—I also produce a piece of a mould which I found on the hearth quite hot—it was part of the one which she threw down and destroyed—she abused us very much and said You b—s you thought you had me to rights but you b—i you have not if you had been here half an hour sooner you would you ought to have been searched before you came here Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was that all she said A Yes at that time—she said more at the police-court—she said You ought to have been searched before coming into the room for you bring a parcel of things into the room drop them here and say I have done it —I did not mention that before because I was not asked—I should have recollected it in an instant JAMES BRANNAN police-sergeant G 20 On the 6th of May I accompanied the officers to a house in New-court Duck-lane Westminster to the second floor front room—the door was securely fastened—it was broken open by sledge hammers by Penny and another constable—I saw the prisoner with a large piece of plaster of Paris which I believe to be a mould in her right hand standing close to a clear fire—she had a ladle in her other hand—I saw her stoop down and place it upon the hearth—she dashed the mould down and stamped upon it with her feet—I instantly seized her and secured her and gave her to Tate and commenced picking up the pieces of plaster of Paris which were very warm under her feet where she had stamped—I did not see her put anything into the spoon myself—I found a Britannia metal spoon upon the hearth very hot—the top of it is melted off—I fonnd upon the table several pieces of copper wire with some silver-leaf attached—die wire was damp with some wet fluid—it was close to some galvanic batteries which had fluid in them at the time—I picked a bottle off the floor which was broken and some liquid from it was spilled upon the floor—I found a quantity of plaster of Paris in powder in a bag in a cupboard—there was a handkerchief round the bag Cross-examined Q How high is the room window A The window-sill is fourteen or sixteen feet from the ground outside COURT Q How do you suppose people got into the room A They must have knocked and been admitted—the boards outside might remain as they were they might take down the planks from inside and admit them EDMUND WHITE I accompanied the officers to this house—I produce one galvanic battery and a pot with silver sand in it they were on a table two brushes which were quite wet with plaster of Paris a basin in which plaster of Paris appears to have been mixed with water and some pieces of a mould which 1 found quite warm on the hearth Cross-examined Q Who did you receive instructions from to go there A From Penny HENET TATE police-constable G 2 On the 6th of May I went with the other officers assisted in forcing the door open and saw the prisoner standing alongside the fire-place—Bran nan took her in charge—I found some galvanic batteries on a table which I took possession of—I had seen her stooping towards the fire—I found this jar and a quantity of solution in it which I have now put into a bottle—I found a small file a quantity of plaster of Paris in a saucer in powder and a pair of nippers Cross-examined Q You say Brannan had her in custody did he not push her towards you and you take her into a corner A Yes—about a minute after he entered the room—the half-crown burnt me—I did not hare it in my hand but Penny put it alongside my hand and it burnt me—it touched my hand WILLIAM MILL AN police-constable B 95 Soon after the door was opened I saw the prisoner with a spoon in her hand—I saw her take it off the fire—I had before that seen her put half-a-crown into it COURT Q Then you saw the spoon first on the fire A Yes—she had pat the half-crown into it which she took off the shelf—she then took the spoon off the fire and put it on the hearth—Inspector Penny took it up and took the half-crown out all in a fluid state—one end of it was melted—the metal in the spoon was in a fluid state—I produce a piece of a counterfeit shilling which I found on the hearth—there was a piece of carpet near the fire all over melted metal—the prisoner was taken to the station—I went there afterwards—next morning she called me and said she bad swallowed a good half-crown while we were breaking the door open and that she was very ill—she appeared very ill and was sent to the hospital Cross-examined Q What did she say when you entered the room A If we had been half an hour sooner we should have got her to rights she was not to rights yet—before she took the iron spoon off the fire she put the half-crown into it—I saw her take it off the shelf just before I could get into the room and put it into the spoon which was in her left hand at the same time—that was the first thing I saw—I have not said within the last few minutes that she put it into the spoon before she took it off the fire—she put it in while she had it in her hand—it was all done in a minute—it was all close to the fire-place—it was such a momentary thing—it was not down on the hearth when she put it in DANIEL FORBES I am inspector of the B division of police On the afternoon of the 6th of May the prisoner was brought to the police station in Vincent-square—I took the charge—about an hour after she was locked up she complained of great pain in her throat and said that in the confusion when the officers entered she had swallowed a good half-crown—I saw a protuberance at the bottom of her throat and sent for a surgeon who recommended her to be removed—she was taken to the hospital and was brought back about nine o clock and was then locked up

counterfeit half-crown cast in a mould—it is white Britannia metal—it hat been partly fused but there is all the impression of a half-crown on it—it ii of the reign of Geo III 1819—putting it into hot liquid metal after leaving the mould would give it this appearance—it is the same metal as the spooni— examining the articles produced —this is a piece of metal called a get which is attached to the coin and subsequently separated—here is a piece of similar metal which appears to have been in a state of fusion—here is similar sort of metal adhering to this piece of carpet—these are three white Britannia metal spoons and an iron spoon containing similar metal which has been fused—a file the teeth of which are full of similar metal and it is used to remove the surplus metal off the coin after casting—here is another file a galvanic battery and another in a jar—they are used to electroplate coin or anything—they are Smee s batteries—this bottle produced by White contains a solution of salt of silver—another bottle with a weak dilution of sulphuric acid used to excite the battery—these copper wires are to conduct the battery to the articles to be plated—here is another quantity of the same solution—toil plaster of Paris is what moulds are usually made of—there is no impression remaining on the pieces of the mould—they are made of plaster of Paris—the whole apparatus is what are used to make counterfeit coin and a good half-crown is used to make an impression on the mould—here is a portion of a counterfeit shilling nearly fused—silver sand is used to polish the metal before

half-sovereigns and the remainder in silver wrapped in separate parcels—I examined the three half-sovereigns myself—they were good—I am certain the one produced is not one of the three—there was a stranger on the same side of the counter as the prisoner—I did not interfere with him Cross-examined Q Is this the first time you have recollected about the stranger being there A No—I was not asked the question before the Magistrate—I put the half-sovereigns in the paper about ten o clock in the morning—my wife and Davis serve in the bar but my wife was not in the bar that morning I am certain

me the half-sovereign I will send for a policeman which I did—after the servant had gone out some time he said You need not trouble yourself I will go and fetch a Policeman myself —I said No you need not do so —he said Well give me the half-sovereign back —I said I will not —the policeman cane during that time and I gave him in charge JAMES HANDLEY policeman I was called to Mr Weston s house found the prisoner there and received this half-sovereign from Mr Weston which I produce—I took the prisoner in charge—he said it was all wrong I ought to let him go about his business—I asked where he lived—he said No 18 King-street Somers—town —I went there and found it was quite false—he then said he lived with somebody in St James s—street—I found that was false—I searched him—I found no money on him—I saw a man standing behind him in the public-house Cross-examined Q When you said he must come with you did not be say Very well A He did not at that time—he was unwilling to go and used very abusive language—I swear he did not say Very well at all—he was very unwilling to go with me—after he was taken into the parlour when I told him the third time he was to go with me he did say Very

visit her—he was there every day almost—I might have seen him every day or I might not—I cannot take my oath of it—I will swear I saw him once a week and that I saw him halfa-dozen times during the whole period—I swear I saw him on the Friday before the 17th—I cannot say what time I should say morning if I said any thing—I will swear it was not night—I often saw him going out about ten or eleven o clock in the morning—I know he was in my house on Friday morning the 16th—there was scarcely a day that I did not see him but I did not watch him in and out—I live in the parlour but my laundry is up stairs and I go up and down—he generally went out of a morning—I have seen him go in and out—he had a latch-key to let himself in at the outer door—they had a key of the apartments between them—nothing made me notice him that afternoon—I did not see a person come there about half an hour after he left and go up to his room—I saw a female go in with Mrs Anderson between five and six o clock on Saturday afternoon—that was the short woman in black I have spoken of—I can t say that she came in the absence of Anderson—I never saw her speak to anybody but Mrs Anderson—I did not notice whether Mrs Anderson had a basket with her or whether the woman had anything—nobody else came that afternoon to my knowledge—their door fastens with a proper key which was given to Wright—the police had not been in communication with me before this MR ROBINSON Q You have not seen the woman in black in the room A No—only coming up stairs with Wright—I don t know whether Anderson was in the room at the time she came—I had seen him go out before—I think they went up stairs and not into the back place Wright Q Did you never open the door to a man in a white flanneljacket who inquired for M Donald

used—here is another pair of moulds intended for casting two sixpences at once having the impression perfect—that does not appear to have been used—here are two counterfeit half-crowns which I have no hesitation in swearing are cast in the second pair of moulds—they are made of Britannia-metal—precisely the same as the spoons and as the metal which is in this iron ladle—they appear to have undergone the first part of the process of galvanic plating—this jar has powdered plaster of paris in it similar to what the moulds are composed of—these leather bands are used to confine the plaster of paris in a fluid state when making the moulds—this knife file and other articles are such as are generally found where coining has been carried on and may be used for that purpose—the file is used for removing the rough surface of the coin—it has white metal in the teeth of it—here are some fluids which are used in the galvanic process Wright Q Is it plaster of paris or whitening in the saucer A A great part of it is plaster of paris—there may be whitening among it—here are twenty-three counterfeit four-penny pieces all cast in one mould and all having undergone the process of electro-plating ALFRED SMEE ESQ I am author of The Elements of Electro-Metalurgy I have examined the acids contained in these bottles—this is strong sulphuric acid—this is diluted sulphuric acid such as would charge a battery—I have ascertained that by placing a small battery in it and this bottle contains a compound of potash and other things—I found all the things necessary to plate metal with a coat of silver—this is a battery fit for the purpose—it only wants the conducting-wire—this is copper wire here The prisoner Wright put in a written defence stating that the articles found in the room and the packets of 4d pieces were given to her by John Barker who frequently visited her to take care of for him and that Anderson knew nothing whatever of the occurrence and that she knew nothing of the hag found in the privy WRIGHT— GUILTY Aged 32 — Transported for Fourteen Years ANDERSON— NOT GUILTY

MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution JAMES BRANNAN police-sergeant G 20 I went with a number of other police-constables on the 19th of April about one o clock in the afternoon to No 3 Peartree-street Westminster—the outer door of the house was open—I went up stairs to the second-floor front room—the door of that room was securely fastened with an iron bolt and a chair behind it and the bedstead against it—I broke the door open and then found it had been barricaded in this manner—when I got in I saw the male prisoner standing on a chair behind the door—his coat and waistcoat were off and his shirt sleeves tucked up—he resisted very much—I pushed him into the arms of Neville and at that time I saw his wife raise up the window with her left hand and put her right hand out—that was after I had given her husband into custody—I gave Hawkins instructions to take the woman into custody—I looked at the fireplace—there was a clear coke and coal fire burning—it was rather a fierce fire—close to the fire-place there was a table on which was a number of counterfeit sixpences some in a tea-cup and some on the table—I laid hold of them—they were warm—eight of them were filled at the edges and three were not—the get was not attached to any of them but apparently was broken off—here are the three which are in a rough state with the get broken off—these other eight have been filed at the edges—I saw a pail containing some water—I put my hand into it and took out some pieces of plaster-of Paris—one of them has a circle on it about the size of sixpence—I placed a sixpence on it—it was about the size but the plaster was partly perished in consequence of being in the water—I wrapped the pieces of plaster soparately and was putting them and the sixpences in a handkerchief into my pocket and the male prisoner sprang from the bed on which he was sitting handcuffed he got the handkerchief from my hand and the pieces of plaster fell about the place—he put his foot on one and said Now you b——r I have done it —there was no plaster on the sixpences before that but they then got mixed with the plaster which gave them the white appearance they now bear—I examined the cupboard and found a small portion of plaster-of-Paris in powder which I produce Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How many of the sixpences were warm A They were all warm—I do not recollect any being cold—some were warmer than others—I saw his wife open the window with her left hand and put her right hand out—I saw Sergeant Tate at the fire-place—I am not able to say what he did—I have not received any money for this—I do not know anything about that—there was a sunken circle on the plaster-of-Paris but no letters—it is about the size of a sixpence HENRY TATE police-sergeant G 2 On the 19th of April I went with Brannan to this place—I assisted in forcing the door of the room—the two Prisoners were in the room—I went to the fire and found a number of counterfeit sixpences—some were on the fire partly melted and others were whole—I found a spoon which had contained metal on the fire—the metal was upset on the fire and some sixpences appeared as if they had been thrown there—I produce them—here are four whole sixpences and four half sixpences—I found eight gets and a part of a sixpence with a get attached to it—I found three files and one of them had the appearance of while metal in the teeth of it—I saw Brannan take some white plaster out of the pail JAMES NEVILL police-constable G 152 I was the other officers—Brannan shoved the male prisoner into my arms—I saw the female prisoner lift up the window with her left hand and throw her right hand out—I picked up a sixpence close by where she was standing at the window—I produce it JEMES HAWKINS police-constable G 191 I went in the room—I secured the female prisoner—her hands were wet and appeared to have plaster-of-Paris on them HENRY HOLLOWAY police-sergeant B 29 I waited outside the house—I saw a female throw something out of the window with her right hand—it fell close to me—it was two counterfeit sixpences—these are them MR JOHN FIELD I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint—the sixpences produced are all counterfeit—they have been cast in two different moulds—some are dated 1840 and some 1845—some of them have been field on the edges to remove the surplus metal left by the get and three or four have not—this piece of plaster-of Paris appears to have been part of a mould—at present there is no impression on it—it appears to have been intended to cast sixpences—the circle is still on it—I apprehend it has been a mould for casting two sixpences at a time—there are parts of two circles—that is exactly the way in which such counterfeit sixpences would be made by castng whit metal and pouring it on the plaster-of-Paris mould—this mould is broken and here is only part of it left—here is a get which has part of a sixpence attached to it now which would appear as if it came from the mould—this whit metal has been partly melted and seems to have been thrown in the fire—this iron spoon would enable parties to melt such metal—it has white metal in the bowl of it now—a clear coke fire would answer the purpose well—here are three files—one of them has white metal in the teeth of it—the whole of these things are what are used for casting coin—here are three or four sixpences some of which are partly melted and some not—they present exactly the appearance of having been thrown suddenly on a fire—a mould made of this material and thrown into water while it was warm would have the impression obliterated very soon Cross-examined Q How long would it take to melt A I suppose not less than five minutes—the impression would be destroyed much earlier MR PAYNE called ANN COLLINS I live at No 1 Old Pye-street Westminster I have known the prisoners about nine months—they lived in the same house with me about six months—they lived together and passed as man and wife—I let them the room afterwards—they were reputed to be man and wife—they slept together and had their meals together MR BODKIN Q What name did they go by A I always called her Mr M Manus—the man went by a nick-name—they used to call him Joss—I have always heard the woman called M Manus and she answered to thatname—they passed as Mr and Mr M Manus—they left the house I live in about a month before Easter—my husband is a journeyman baker—I am kept in that house to look after it—it belongs to Mr Abbott—it is a lodging-house—men come and hire a lodging for a night—the two prisoners took the room together—I let it them—they have now a two pair of stairs front room at 3s 6d a week—the man gets his living by selling things in the street—the woman goes out washing or charring or anything she can do—I know that her mother lives at Chelsea—I saw her one day last week when she was coming to get a Counsel for her—I do not know her sister—I have heard her say she had a sister—I never heard her say

This is the woman —there were four women in the cell—he pointed to the prisoner and said That is the woman and I said I knew her without MR BODKIN Q Did you know her without his pointing A Yes when I went to the cell—if I had gone alone without the policeman I should have known her of my own knowledge—she had a child when she came to my house—she had not one in the cell—I have no doubt about her

COURT Q You say you are sure the sixpence you took out was the one you had put in A Yes—I should not like to swear to it having had it out of my hand—I do not think it was one of the other sixpences but my motive was that I wanted to avoid any further trouble—I thought the case would have been discharged—I did not tell the Magistrate so but that was the reason I would not swear to it—I expected the Magistrate would not commit the prisoner—I said so that he might not commit the prisoner and that I might have no further trouble about it WILLIAM JOHN ANDREWS policeman On the 20th Oct my

coppers—she said they belonged to a broom person they did not belong to her Cross-examined Q Why did not you go before the Magistrate A I was not required to go—the policeman did not know I had found

shilling she gave me MARY DOUSE I keep a chandlers shop in Shaftesbury-street New North-road On 27th Nov the prisoner came there near seven o clock in the evening—he wanted half an ounce of tobacco—I served him—it came to 1 3/4d —he gave me a half-crown—I gave him change—I put the half-crown into the till—I had no other half-crown there only three sixpences—the instant the prisoner had gone out of the shop before any other customer had come in I looked at the half-crown and found it was bad—while I was looking at it a butcher came in who was a stranger to me—he said something to me and went out of the shop again—he came back again in about five minutes with the prisoner and the officer and two or three more persons—I gave the officer the half-crown I received from the prisoner—he was then taken into custody Cross-examined Q The butcher came in just at the moment you were looking at the half-crown A Yes he looked at it—the prisoner was brought back in five minutes by Jellett the officer—the butcher came also—he took his tray and went away—I have seen him once since he called on me and asked whether the prisoner was taken—that was all that passed MR BODKIN Q Did the half-crown go out of your sight at all A No I had it in my hand—the butcher left his tray against a cask of soda at my door there was meat in it he came back shouldered his tray and went away HENRY JELLETT policeman N 383 On Saturday evening 27th Nov I saw the prisoner in Hoxton being held by two men—they said he had passed a bad half-crown to a poor woman—I took him back to Douse s shop—she made the same charge and gave me this half-crown—I took the prisoner to the station went back to the same place where I had seen him held and somebody gave me half an ounce of tobacco Cross-examined Q Who were the two men A One was Macklin whom I knew from living near the other was a lamplighter—Macklin went with me to Douse s shop and several persons followed JAMES BRETT I am a lamp-lighter in Ironmonger-row St Luke s On 27th Nov about seven o clock I was in New North-road near Douse s shop—I saw the prisoner two men had hold of him—I went up—they said he had passed a bad half-crown to a poor woman—I heard another person say he had thrown some money away and he pointed to the place—about that time the policeman came and took the prisoners way—I picked up half an ounce of tobacco—the next morning early I was coming by the spot that had been pointed out to me and I saw a half-crown lay—I picked it up—it was bad—I gave it to the police sergeant Cross-examined Q You call yourself a lamp-lighter A I am a gaslighter round St Luke s—one of the men who was holding the prisoner is outside—he is a painter I believe—I do not know that I ever saw him before—I did not see a butcher nor a tray—I looked for the half-crown that night but it was so dark I could not see it—I found it in Deane-street which is a public throughfare between seven and eight o clock the next morning EDWARD MACKLIN I am a painter in Cliff-street New North-road On the evening of 27th Nov I was spoken to by a butcher and the prisoner was pointed out to me—I went up to him and said You have been giving a woman a bad half-crown come back and deliver the change to the poor woman she will not hurt you —he said I have not done such a thing I have passed no half-crown —the butcher and I brought him back to the end of the street and he threw another half-crown away—whether it was good or bad I cannot say—he trampled it in the mud—Jellett came up and took the prisoner into custody—I saw Brett afterwards give the policeman the tobacco Cross-examined Q When did you do any painting A The last time I was painting was the inside of a house in St Jame s-park—I work for Mr Cox of Cobham-road—we were working at that house in the park about six weeks—the house is just through Storey s-gate—I believe it is called Birdcage-walk—I have always been a painter—I do not know that I was indignant at the prisoner s offering the half-crown to the poor woman—I never did such a thing myself—I can swear I have never been convicted of uttering counterfeit coin and was never charged with it—I did not say to the prisoner as I was taking him towards Douse s that I would give it him to his heart s content—on my oath I had not had a quarrel with him—I have known him by sight for ten or twelve years—I had not seen him for three years before—I have not had a quarrel with him and fastened this matter on him to spite him—I had no quarrel with him at skittles—I did not threaten that I would be a match for him some day—I do not know that I ever played at skittles with him—he never refused to pay me—I never was in his company but once—I was not tried in this place and convicted three years and a half age for uttering counterfeit coin—I never stood in this dock nor in the dock in the other Court on my oath—the night the prisoner was taken he said in the station You have been one of the same sort yourself —I was not charged with uttering two bad shillings in change to a woman who bought mackerel of me in Leather-lane—I never sold such a thing in my life—I will swear I did not sell mackerel in Leather-lane and give a woman two bad shillings to charge for five-shilling piece—there is not a syllable of truth in it WILLIAM SAUNDERS police-sergeant N 25 I produce a half-crown which I received from Brett—I have kept it apart from all others CALEB EDWARD POWELL This shilling is counterfeit—these two half-crowns are counterfeit and both cast in the same mould—I have been attending the Mint prosecutions for many years—I have no knowledge of the wit-ness Macklin he is quite a stranger to me GUILTY Aged 25 — Transported for Seven Years 
t18471213-330  330 GEORGE SMITH for a like offence MESSRS BODKIN and ROBINSON conducted the Prosecution CALEB EDWARD POWELL I produce a copy of the record of the conviction of George Smith at the Sept Sessions 1844—I have examined it with the original—it is a true copy— read—George Smith Convicted Sept 1844 and confined one year WILLIAM FLANNGAN police-sergeant S 41 I was present at the prisoner s trial in Sept 1844 CAROLINE MATTHEWS My husband keeps the Fox at Cowley in the parish of Hillingdon On 19th Nov the prisoner came there accompanied by two females—they called for a glass of hot gin-and-water—I served it—it came to 6d —the prisoner laid down as I thought a half-sovereign—I gave him 9s 6d in charge—I took the half-sovereign up-stairs put it into a bureau locked it up and gave the key to my husband—there was no other half-sovereign there—the next day in consequence of something that was told me my husband went up stairs and when he came down he showed me the same half-sovereign I had taken up the night before—I saw it was bad Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How did you know it A I did not stay to put it with the gold—I laid it with the silver—I did not go up with my husband to fetch it—he had the key—I do not say that I recognize the half-sovereign as the one I had given me the night before HENRY MATTHEWS I went up to the bureau on 20th Nov to get out half-a-sovereign—my wife had given me the key of the bureau the night before and it had remained in my possession—I found the half-sovereign in the bottom of the bureau—there was no other gold near it—I kept it till the policeman came—he told me to mark it—I did so and gave it him—this is it—here is my mark on it Cross-examined Q You put a mark on it A Yes on that Saturday night—I can say that this is the one I took out of the bureau on the Saturday—there might be about 2l worth of silver in the bureau and there might be ten or twelve sovereigns in gold but that was in a bag in the bureau—I know there was a 5l note changed—I believe the change was in half-sovereigns partly MR PAYNE to CAROLINE MATTHEWS Q What gold was in the bureau A I do not know exactly—there might have been twenty sovereigns—it was in a bag—I had given change for a 5l note on Saturday morning—I believe with ten half-sovereigns—we had a good many half-sovereigns as we generally have—I do not know how I came to put this half-sovereign with the silver but I did do so—I was in a hurry—I thought they were respectable people and to accommodate them I took the change out of the bureau and gave it them MR BODKIN Q Where was the silver A Laid down in front and I laid the half-sovereign there—when I changed the 5l note I took all the half-sovereigns out of the bag MARY ANN CLAYTON My husband keeps the Anchor at Yewsley which is better than a mile from Mrs Matthews On 19th Nov about half-past six the prisoner came with two females—he asked for a pint of beer and while I was drawing it he asked if I could give him change for a half-sovereign—I said I believed I could—I received a half-sovereign from him and gave him 9s 10d —there was some talk about their being in a hurry to go by the train—I laid the half-sovereign on the counter—I afterwards discovered it was bad and gave it to my husband—I am sure it was the same I received from the prisoner—I went with my husband to the railway-station and found the prisoner and the two women there—the women were taken—one of them called out George and the prisoner looked out of a carriage—I was before the Magistrate on the following morning—I saw the half-sovereign which I had given to my husband produced there—it was put down on the desk—the prisoner caught it put it up to his mouth and swallowed it we suppose we did not see it afterwards Cross-examined Q You went to the train in consequence of what they said that they were going by it A Yes WILLIAM CLAYTON I received a half-sovereign from my wife on 19th of Nov —I have not the least doubt it was a bad one—I took it wrapped in a bit of paper to the railway and gave it to the policeman—the prisoner was taken out of the railway-carriage—I was taken before the Magistrate the next day and saw the half-sovereign produced—it was laid down on the desk the prisoner seized it put it to his mouth and made a motion and said It is gone Cross-examined Q How do you know it was bad A It would not ring—it was very light—I could tell by the weight of it on my finger JOSEPH HENRY TAYLOR policeman F 215 In consequence of information I took the prisoner at the West Drayton station—I received a half-sovereign from Mr Clayton—I looked at it—it was bad—I produced it before the Magistrate the next morning—the prisoner sprang forward took it and swallowed it—he said That is where forty more or many more are gone —I found 8s 6d on him at the railway—I afterwards found 10s 8 1/4d —I asked him where he got that as he had not it before—he said his wife gave it him CALEB EDWARD POWELL This half-sovereign is counterfeit—it is made of white metal and galvanized GUILTY Aged 30 — Transported for Seven Years Before Mr Common Serjeant

undertaking purporting to be an undertaking for the payment of money of the Empire of Russia and SOLOMON MUSCOVITZ feloniously inciting them to commit the said felony and as an accessory after the fact to which AARONSON and MUSCOVITZ pleaded GUILTY Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutors — Confined Eighteen Months MESSRS CLARKSON and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution SARAH MYERS I am married and live at 28 Bury-street St Mary Axe In April last year Friedeburg came to live at our house—he left about the end of May came again in the middle of July and left in October—he had told me he expected his cousin from abroad—I have seen all the prisoners at his lodgings—Muscovitz lodged there in another part of the house—Friedeburg said Kauffman was his cousin and the expected him to pay him some money Friedeburg Q Did I leave in Oct A Yes—I am sure you told me that you expected a cousin before Kauffman came and before I saw any of the other prisoners GEORGE LAWRENCE LEE I am a lithographic artist and printer at 245 High Holborn and sell lithographic materials About the end of Sept from 20th to 25th Friedeburg and Kauffman came and purchases a lithographic stone of me for 2s —this is produced —a day or two after they called and said they should want to hire a press—I showed them one it was the smaller press produced—they were to deposit 4l and pay 5s a fortnight for the hire—they came again in the evening and Aaronson with them—they paid the 4l deposit—I signed this receipt for it and gave it to Aaronson—I lent them a printing roller and another stone an ink slab and twenty scrapers without any extra charge—they took the press away—I have two places of business and my wife sometimes attends to one of them—she was not present when I lent the press— receipt read—Received of Mr Alexander 4l as a deposit on the loan of a small litho press two rollers ink-stand and one lithographic press with two scrapers to be lent for their use for a fortnight from 25th Sept 1847 for which 5s us to be paid for the loan GEORGE LEE —Alexander is the name Aaronson gave me—two or three days after Kauffman called at my house and said he could not make the press work—I offered to go to his place to see it and we went first to a house in Newton-street Holborn to a room on the ground-floor—I saw Friedeburg there—I do not recollect whether there was any one else—there was a German there—I asked to look at the press—they consulted a little while whether they should show it me or no—they agreed to do so and Kauffman went with me to Short s-gardens near Drury-lane—I was shown into a room up stairs and the press was brought there by Kauffman from another room—the press appeared to have been tried—the handle was off it was broken—I showed Kauffman how to use it merely by putting a board under the stone to raise it to a sufficient height—this is part of the press produced —about ten days after I found this press had been returned to my shop and another a larger one was gone—I was not present at the time—I have since seen the larger one in the hands of the officer Friedeburg Q One morning we went with you to see the press at Short s-gardens A Yes—I was taken into your lodging as I passed—I did not understand what you spoke about—I inferred what you were consulting about by your gestures—it was a short thick-set man a German that brought the press into the room at Short s-gardens—I did not see any appearance of a lithographic establishment at you lodging in Newton-street—you did not go with us to Short s-gardens JULIA LEE I am the wife of George Lee About a fortnight after Mr Lee had parted with the smaller press I exchanged it to Kauffman and Friedeburg for the larger one—I lent them this stone for 3s more at the same time JAMES OLIPHANT I am a stationer at 47 Threadneedle-street On 29th Sept Aaronson and Kauffman came there and purchased two quires of paper—they consulted one another as to the quality of the paper—it was of two different kinds—I believe this produced is a portion of what I sold them—Aaron came again on 22nd Oct and purchased the remainder of one of the sets of paper—it is the same sort as that on which the lithography is and I believe it to be the same—he purchased all I had—he said he should most likely want some more of it and I kept back a sheet as a sample—this is it ANN ELLSEY I keep the house 8 Queen-street Soho where three of the prisoners were apprehended Aaronson and Friedeburg came on 4th Oct to look at the apartments for a French gentleman name Marchant who could not speak English—that was Kauffman—the same evening a strange man with Friedenburg brought this press in a truck—Kauffman was not there till half an hour afterwards—only Kauffman lives there—after he came I saw Aaronson and Friedeburg every day—I cannot say exactly how long they remained—Friedeburg used to be there pretty well all day on and off but Aaronson used to come once or twice a day—there was a bench in Kauffman s room—I do not know who it belonged to—it was brought there with Kauffman Friedeburg Q Did I Aaronson speak to your lodger A You both spoke to him in French SAMUEL STRAKER I am a lithographer at 80 Bishopsgate-street Within and sell lithographic materials On 17th Sept last Friedeburg and Kauffman came to my shop and purchased two lithographic stones for 3s 6d —this is the bill of parcels I gave to Friedeburg produced —he said he had no money to pay for them that he had come out without his money and he would step and get the 3s 6d which he did—Kauffman could articulate a few words in French by which I understood that he had come from Paris and that he was a poor artist and he was about to do some lithographic work and having no press he asked me whether I would allow him to bring his work to prove—that is the technical term for taking an impression—I said he might do it—he did not come to do so—he came again on 29th Sept with Aaronson and purchased another lithographic stone which was cut in three pieces—these produced are two of those pieces—I think Aaronson was the only person that could speak English therefore he must have given the instructions to have it cut into three—he said his press was nine inches wide—that is an unusual size and there was no alternative but to cut the stone—this is my bill for them produced Friedeburg Q Did not I ask you if you had any work for Kauffman A You made some causal remark of the kind ELIZABETH HAY I live at 9 Newton-street Holborn The prisoners Friedeburg and Kauffman came there to lodge in Sept and left on 4th Oct —they only occupied one room the back parlour—there was at first one bed in it—they wished for two and another was prepared—Kauffman was in the habit of remaining in-doors all day—Friedeburg was in and out nearly all day—about a week after they came I recollect a small printing-press coming—Friedeburg asked me if I had got any stone by me—I said No —I gave him two pieces of board—he said he could make them do for a short time—he said he was an interpreter of foreign languages—Kauffman said he was a French wafer-maker—they were in the habit of working in their room in the daytime—the window of the room was accessible to the sight of any person—there was a muslin curtain to it and Friedeburg asked for a thicker blind—Friededurg said he expected some stone and asked me if I would take it in if it came—Aaronson came to see them frequently—I suppose I have seen him six or seven times—I have seen him there twice a day—I have noticed when they were at home that their door was locked—I have several times gone to the door and Friedeburg has unlocked it to answer me—that has occurred frequently—I cannot say whether they were both there then—I did not go in—I asked them for what I required at the door—I always found the door locked when I supposed they were working Friedeburg Q When did I leave the lodging A To the best of my recollection it was 4th Oct —you did not go out in the clothes you are now wearing—you wore a large morning coat a wrapper—I do not recollect seeing Kauffman in any different clothes to those he now has on—I did not see any preparation for a press when I went into your room to make the bed—I saw the press go out—I did not see the stones come—you said you expected some letters from France and when you received them you would be obliged to leave directly—I said it was a rule to have a week s notice and you said it was a rule you were ignorant of—that was on the Sunday night before you left on the Monday—you paid me the rent on the Monday morning—it was due that day—I said as you were ignorant of the rules of the lodging I did not wish you to pay it as you wished to leave directly—Aaronson came to you several times and a lady and gentleman also came to the door—I knocked at your door but only a strange man came out—I saw about thirty people coming to you backwards and forwards COURT Q Do you mean as many as thirty people came and saw Friedeburg A Yes—They appeared all foreigners DANIEL FORRESTER I am a police-officer On 15th Oct I went with my brother and two or three other constables to 8 Queen-street Soho—I knocked at the door—it was opened and I proceeded to the third floor—I struck the door with a hammer knocked it open and saw Kauffman standing at the head of a small table—his face was towards me—he had a pair of scissors in his hand—Friedeburg and Aaronson were standing on my left at the table—they were only looking on—these printed papers produced were on the table—I immedistely secured the prisoners Kauffman Aaronson and Friedeburg—in a bed in the room between the clothing and the bed I found this parcel of notes and in a cupboard in the room I found this parcel— producing them —I found this other parcel in the lining or pocket of Kauffman s coat—I was obliged to cut it out—this printing-presa was open in the room and several stones which my brother took charge of—there were a great many other things brought away most of which I believe he also has—I found a key on Friedeburg which opened the door of 45 wardour-street Soho where he said he was lodging—on pulling off the bedclothes there I saw some printed parcels which my brother took possession of—this type was found in the room in Queen-street—I have Kauffman s pocket-book—there was nothing in it connected with this case Friedeburg Q Did you try to open the door without the hammer A I do not think I did—I am not sure that it was locked—I did not find any Russian notes in your pocket—it was at the Mansion House that you said you lived at 45 Wardour-street—you might have said that before but I do not recollect it—I do not recollect that you requested me to go there—I did go the same night—the landlord told me there were two rooms taken and that was your room and the key unlocked it—he showed me a room on another floor where two other persons slept—I did see any other persons there—there was no one there when the door was open—I do not recollect your saying anything about your having two rooms there—I recollect your saying something about two other persons but whether it was that day or afterwards I cannot say—I think it must have been somewhere about two or three o clock that I took you to the Mansion House—you wanted me to take the two men into custody—I did not do so—you told me that you lived at 45 Wardour-street with two other persons—I did not find two persons at your lodgings—the landlord showed me the room where two persons had lodged but they were not there Kauffman Q You say found some papers in the lining of my clothes A I cannot tell whether they were in the lining or the pocket—I may have cut through the pocket or the lining—they might have been in the pocket—this is the note found in the prayer-book produced MR BALLANTINE Q Who had possession of the prayer-book A My brother—I took it from Kauffman—I cannot say whether it was found on him or in the room—he claimed it—I went through all the leaves and found the notes—I searched Muscovitz and found these two notes in this envelope with another in his pocket-book—I took him the same day at 139 in the Minories—When I went into the room I saw him fumbling something—I caught hold of his hand and took from it these three notes—the other three were in the pocket-book—he gave an explanation of them—I took this tracing of transfer paper from Kauffman s pocket JOHN FORRESTER I accompanied my brother and the other officer on 15th Oct to 8 Queen-street—I searched Aaronson and found on him a pocket-book with this note in it also this receipt for 4l and this bill of Mr Straker s for the three stones—my brother produced a key to the landlord of the house in Wardour-street which we went to—we applied it to am room which the landlord pointed out as occupied by Friedeburg—it opened it—we went in together with the landlord—my brother lifted up the bed and took out this bundle of notes from between the bed and mattress—they have only an impression on one side—I also found this one—I do not think there was more than one of these—I saw the note found in the leaves of the prayerbook after Kauffman had applied for it—my brother took the out of my hand and I saw him take the note out—I produce some stone which I took charge of—I found it in Queen-street in the room where the prisoner were apprehended—I cannot recollect where—I am almost positive it was on the table—this smaller stone laid on the table I think—it did not then appear as it does bow but quite plain—an of ordinary observer would not see that there was anything engraved on it—it was quite clean—we could not see that there was anything on either of them at that time—the back boards of the press were in this state producing them with marks of the plates in them —I produce another stone which was found at Queen-street with part of the note on it—think it was found on the floor at the foot or the back part of the bed—it appeared then to be quite plain Frideburg Q Do you recollected after I was locked up my requesting to speak to an officer of the Mansion-House and some person introducing you A Yes—I think you told me to go your lodging 45 Wardour-street—I did not go then—I went at eight o clock in the evening and I found these notes in the room which the landlord told me was yours—I did not ask him whether you had one room ar two—I do not recollect your saying you lived in two rooms—I found the notes on the first floor and these other papers produced —they were not on the floor—I think they were in a kind of bag—I searched your pocket-book but found no notes—I have not found Mr Lee s press MR CLARKSON Q I believe you were acting under the instructions of the Russian consul from the begging to the end A I was and I received information from tome to time CHARLES CLARK I am an interpreter I have been employed by the Russian government in this matter—I have seen a note which professes to be an impression from the small stone—it was shown me by Mr Peachy—I have translated it—this is the copy—I have compared my translation with that in the indictment—it is a accurate— the translation was her read Friedeburg Q Are you interpreter for the Russian government A No for the consul—the note from which I translated this is in the solicitor s possession—I wrote on it the word translated — looking at one of the forged notes I should say this is identical with the one which I translated—I can not only read what is legible but I have transcribed into English the whole of the Russian text where the words are not quit distinct the witness at friedeburg s request here read the note in Russian —I can see the number of letters and and that enables me to read it but if this small print stood quite by itself I should hesitate FREDERICK GEORGE NETHERCLIFF JUN I am a lithographic artist and carry on business with my father in king William-street I have had put into my hands a stone bearing the reverse side of a Russian note—the impression was then scarcely perceptible—it had been washed out with turpentine or oil I cannot exactly say which both would do in lithography and covered with a composition to preserve it as occasion might hereafter require—that is the ordinary course adopted to preserve an impression—if the stone is wanted for another purpose the lithographer must grind the impression off before he could put another on it—if it was not entirely ground off there are means by which he could revive it—after a critical examination of the small stone I found it had gone through that process for the purpose of preserving that which was under the composition—I removed the composition with a piece of flannel and a little turpentine with the aid of the prisoner s roller rubbed the stone with it and brought up the original impression in the state in which it now is—I afterwards proceeded to take impressions from the stone having taken it home for that purpose—it certainly was not a worn stone—I suppose the composition was put on to reserve it—that is the rule—I produce some of the impressions I took from it—I took about half-a-dozen on paper and more on parchment CHARLES CLARK re-examined I have looked at these impressions—this is the one from which I made the translation—I make out on this side of it exactly what I have read as my translation and have compared it with the indictment MR NETHERCLIFF continued There is a process which we call re-transferring which is done from one stone to another by means of transfer paper—this stone is not in the state it was in when I first saw it—it had been attempted to be ground down but it was very imperfectly done—the state in which it now appears is the result of the process to which I had recourse for removing what had been put on it—it now shows two sides of eight notes—you could scarcely see the front part of the note—it is my opinion that the front was first lithographical then endeavoured to be removed and the back placed on the same stone—by having recourse to the reviving process I found the remaining portion of the front and a portion of the back—I have not the least doubt but that has been effected from this smaller stone I can prove it—I mean that the re-transfer has been taken from it—by means of the transfer paper eight separate transfers were taken from it—this is a perfectly removed impression of the front of one of these notes—I have no doubt of it—I have seen these sheets of eight notes and also the single notes—I am decidedly of opinion that these impressions were taken from these stones—I have not the slightest doubt about it—you will find they are the same on comparing them—I speak positively as to the back but not to the front—it is my opinion that the impression has been re-transferred from one stone to the other—the smaller stone has only got the back of the note—I only speak to those that are eight on a sheet Friedeburg Q Have you compared them with a genuine not A Yes—it is wretchedly done it is an attempt to imitate it but very badly done CARL JACOB PIEPER through the interpreter I am a member of the Bank of Russia—it is a Government bank One rouble notes are circulated by that bank—the value of a rouble in English money is about 3s 1d —the rouble note has a back to it similar to the back of these forged notes—these sheets of notes are similar to our Russian notes—rouble notes are very largely circulated in Russia and they become very much worn—the three signatures to these notes are forged—in a proper note the first signature is printed and the last two are manuscript—they are printed in these notes—his produced is a genuine note of the Russian Bank Friedeburg Q Could anybody make use of such a forged note in Russia A Certainly because an ignorant person would take it as a genuine one—these forged ones have no number on them—in Russia the numbers are put on them before they are signed—it is not a note till the number is put on—there are many minor differences but it has a similarity to a Russian note—I have nothing to do with the manufacturing department only the signing MR CLARK re-examined I have here a translation of the whole of one of the notes—I made it from one of the sheets of eight— This being read stated that on its being presented it would be immediately paid and purported to be signed by two directors and the cashier Friedeburg s Defence written I am a furrier by trade and was carrying on the same in Bury-street St Mary Axe Five weeks previous to my being arrested on the present charge a man came to me named Beek residing at 5 Ebenezer-square and recommended a man named Max as a worker in my trade I wanted a man at this time to assist me I went to Houndsditch with Beck to see Max and engaged him to come and work Max commenced work with me the next day and continued in my employ ten days During his being with me he was visited every day by two persons named Rochelt and Kauffman I inquired of Max who they were he answered me One Rochelt was a partner of his and Kauffman came with him Max and Rochelt together from France to form a lithographic establishment in this country I took little or no notice of this Every day during the time of Max being in my employ he and Rochelt were continually saying that me trade of a furrier would prove far more lucrative in France than in this country and Kauffman promised to give me numerous recommendations to respectable houses there and tried to persuade me to accompany them to France Being anxious to avail myself of any honourable way of bettering myself I thought it might prove advantageous for me to follow their advice A difficulty however presented itself my passport was only good for Holland not for France I showed them the passport and they answered me Never mind Mr Friedeburg we have travelled many times between France and London and we have many friends in France and if you will wait a fortnight till we get letters and money from our friends we will certainly take you to France with our passport I finished the work I had on hand and not having any more to go on with I went and took a room in Newton-street Holborn At this time Max and Rochelt were living in Short s-gardens Drury-lane The day before I took the lodgings in Newton-street Kauffman came home and said he should be much obliged if I would take lodgings so that he might come every night and sleep with me as he was badly accommodated where he was and he would pay me 1s 6d a week for the accommodation Kauffman seeming a respectable man and having promised to give me recommendations for my work in France I agreed to the proposal I occasionally visited Max and Rochelt and Max and Rochelt visited me I asked them every day when we should go to France as I was anxious to be working at my business again having nothing to depend upon but my labour He answered Don t hurry we shall soon have letters from France and then we shall go immediately I asked Kauffman what business he was following in this country He said the same as Max and Rochelt had told me that he was trying to form a lithographic establishment in this country and that he expected his presses from France and as he could not speak English he asked me to go with him to a lithographic printer and borrow a press for him for a fortnight I accordingly went with him to a lithographic printer in Holborn and he borrowed one agreeing to pay him 5s for the loan of it for a fortnight and agreeing to leave 4l as a deposit I bought of the same printer a stone for Kauffman for 2s I asked Kauffman if he had the 4l with him he said he had not but he had a friend a gentleman who would come with him to-morrow and pay the deposit I then said to the printer I will come with this gentleman and pay the deposit The next day Kauffman came to me with a gentleman whom he called Aaronson a countryman of mine who had resided five years in Paris and had only lately come from thence Kauffman then said Mr Aaronson will pay the deposit if you will go with us to the printer and see it paid I went with Messrs Aaronson and Kauffman and saw it paid Kauffman took the press to the lodgings of Max and Rochelt in Short s-gardens Kauffman was there the whole of every day and came to sleep with me at night I called several times to see Max and Rochelt and asked if they had received the expected letters and when I should go with them to France At those times I did not see Kauffman he being as I understood engaged in his own room I asked Max and Rochelt Where is Kauffman He replied He is very busy I did not take any notice of this thinking he was earing money for himself in his own business The fortnight which Max and Rochelt wished me to wait passed away I then began to be uneasy as I wanted to be working at my business again One morning Max and Rochelt came home and said Mr Friedeburg we have received letters from France and our wives say they cannot send us the money now but in twelve days or a fortnight we shall have it for certain Now Mr Friedeburg if you will wait that time we give you word of honour that you and us will surely go to France and in order that your expenses in waiting that time may be less it will be better for us three to live together for the next fortnight Having waited a fortnight already and being without work and depending upon their promises I consented to wait the time they mentioned and went and took two rooms one on the first floor and one on the third floor in War-dour-street Soho We lived there together Sometimes I slept on the third floor with Max and sometimes I slept on the first floor by myself During the time I lived in Wardour-street Kauffman came every day to see Max and Rochelt Kauffman at this time had left the lodgings in Short s-gardens where he had lived with Max and Rochelt and had taken others in Queen-street Soho I sometimes called at his lodgings there having spare time on my hands and found him unemployed at which I was surprised and asked him if he bed not any work to do He replied I expect work every day When I had lived a week in Wardour-street with Max and Rochelt they gave me 4s 8d to which I added 2s 4d and went and paid the landlord the rent taking a receipt and at the same time giving him notice of my in-tention of leaving the lodgings at the end of the week it being my design to go back into the City to obtain employment in my trade should Max and Rochelt fail to fulfil their promise of taking me to France at the expiration of that time On the Friday following the 15th Oct in the morning Mr Aaronson came to visit me I was at the time in the third-floor room with Max and Rochelt where I had slept that night Max having slept on the first floor Max and Rochelt said to Mr Aaronson and me Mr Friede-burg and Mr Aaronson the Frenchman who lives in Queen-street Sohe would deem it a favour if you would call upon him this morning as he has something very particular to say to you I was not dressed at the time Mr Aaronson said Go and dress yourself Mr Friedeburg and we will go and see what the Frenchman wishes to say to us so very parlicular I went down to the first floor to dress myself and while I was doing so Max came in and brushed his clothes I finished dressing and went up stairs to Mr Aaronson leaving Max in the room Shortly after I came down stairs with Mr Aaronson to accompany him to see Kauffman Passing by the first-floor room I saw the door open and no one inside the key being in the door I locked it and took away the key with me When we got to Kauffman s lodgings I said to him What is it you wish to say so particularly to Mr Aaronson and myself He seemed very much surprised at my question and said I never told Max and Rochelt to say anything of the kind When I got into his room I saw lying on a table many papers having some resemblance to Russian bank-notes I took up one sheet and said laughingly What fool has been spoiling paper in this way and asked Kauffman where he had got so much rubbish He answered I got it yesterday from Max and Rochelt to cut it for them He then requested that I would not tell Max and Rochelt that I bed seen the papers as they had requested him not to let me see them and said that if Max and Rochelt asked him if I had seen the papers he should tell them that I had not We remained in conversation about ten minutes when to my surprise Messrs Forresters burst into the room and declared us to be their prisoners Kauffman s Defence through an interpreter Max and Rochelt arrived here on 26th Aug they engaged me and were to pay all my expenses Max gave me the notes on 23rd Sept and asked me to go with him to establish a lithographic establishment and he bought materials for 20s he said we should make these notes on 10th Sept I had no money to pay my lodging I went about to every shop to look for work and could not find any I told Max I should go he said if I went he should make the greater fortune he said he should make four hundred francs I said I would stop two days I had in my possession the stone the press and other materials Max took all the materials except the stone and press to his lodgings Max had the press in his possession five days I could not work without it all the things belong to Max it is all owing to him and Rochelt they brought me here and then left me Friedeburg called HENRY MYERS Friedeburg lived at my house and followed the business of a cap-maker—I have seen fur caps—I saw two or three persons at different times in his room—I have no recollection of seeing a stout man there—I have seen two young men who worked up in his place SAMUEL SLOMAN I live at 45 Wardour-street Soho Friedeburg took two rooms there of my wife one was a small room on the first floor and one a larger room on the third floor—he paid 7s a-week—he came in the evening by himself with a truck—I was in the shop at the time and he left the things with me and went up into the little bed-room—he said he expected two men to come and ask for his room—I showed him the room on the landing he took his tea and went to bed—I understand that Aaronson took the lodging for him in my absence—he afterwards told me he expected two of his men to sleep in the front attic but did not know whether they would come that night—Friedeburg and the two men used to eat together up in the attic where the two men slept MR CLARKSON Q Was Friedeburg in the habit of keeping his roomdoor locked A He was and he kept the key—he gave it to my wife to make the

t18480515-1225  1225 GEORGE ALEXANDER was again indicted with WILLIAM WILMOT for feloniously silvering 2 pieces of counterfeit coin intended to pass for sixpences MESSRS BODKIN and ROBINSON conducted the Prosecution JAMES BRANNAN police-sergeant G 20 On Saturday 6th May I was in company with constables Harvey Neville and Hawkins in George-street Foley-street Tottenham-court-road and saw the prisoner Alexander come from No 27 in that street—I crossed over with the other constables seized him by the arm and told him I belonged to the police and had directions to take him into custody on suspicion of having in his possession counterfeit coin—I pushed him into a shop put my hand into his waistcoat pocket and found in it two half-crowns and ten shillings separately divided by paper to prevent them rubbing—he said It is all right you have got me to rights —I also found four half-crowns five shillings six sixpences and seven fourpenny-pieces all good—I then took him to the house he came from and knocked at the door—it was opened by a female and I asked her what part of the house Alexander occupied—she hesitated and Alexander said It is all right the top back attic —we went to that room and found the key in the lock outside—I unlocked the door entered the room and saw Wilmot at a table with his back towards me his coat off and his shirt sleeves tucked up—I seized him and took him to a distant part of the room—on the table stood four galvanic battery jars and four cups out of one of which Wilmot took a sixpence when I seized him—Hawkins immediately took it from him—in the same cup there were these three other counterfeit sixpences in a solution to receive a colour like silver—each battery jar was connected by a wire with silver leaf attached in the cup in which was some solution—I produce a portion—the other cups contained solution and counterfeit shillings—on the table I found strewed 25 shillings and 15 sixpences all of which appeared to have been recently operated upon—on the windowledge which was a sort of work-bench I found 14 counterfeit half-crowns with the rough edges on them after having been cast and before being silvered and three counterfeit shillings complete for circulation—I also found this piece of iron steel with a graining on the edge for the purpose of milling the edges to give them a perfect appearance—I also found these ten files with white metal in their teeth five powders of different colours five bottles containing liquid and these five plaster-of-paris moulds in a box near the window three for casting half-crowns one of which was warm a double mould for shillings and a double mould for sixpences—I also found two iron ladles with a piece of white metal in one hot forming the get which is the refuse cast into the channel of the mould—several tin bands for the purpose of forming plaster-of-pairs moulds with plaster adhering to them seven galvanic battery plates and some copper wires which appear as if they had been dipped in the solution they were then dry—I also found a pair of large scissors and two knives with plaster-of-paris adhering to the blades Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Who was with you when you spoke to Alexander A Harvey and Neville—I think he was about six or seven doors from the house—the door was closed—I was in George-street when I first saw him—I do not think he could see me—I was in a house and Neville and Harvey also—another policeman in private clothes was further on in the street—it is very likely Alexander knew me by sight—when he came out he turned to the left towards Marylebone-street and O pursued him the other constables were by when he said I had got him to rights—I had received my instructions in writing from Mr Powell—the other policemen were under my directions—I should not have gone to the back attic unless Alexander had told me that was his room—I should have gone to the house MR BODKIN Q Did you lose sight of Alexander from the time he left the house till you took him into custody A No—I took him two or three minutes after he came out of the house and we were back in the house two or three minutes after he came our—he did not communicate with anybody—I did not give him an opportunity JOHN HARVEY policeman G 118 I went into this house and found on the table in the room these eight shillings and two sixpences counterfeit— produced Cross-examined Q Have you been in Court while Brannan was being examined A No—I was stationed in a chandler s-shop with two more policemen nearly opposite the house Alexander came out of—when he came out I followed him and overtook him at the bottom of the street about fifty or 100 yards off—he was there pushed into a shop and searched and afterwards taken back to the house—that was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after he had come out MR BODKIN Q Was Brannan in the chandler s shop A Yes—I did not see Alexander communicate with any one before he was taken—he did not offer any resistance—the money was taken from him directly and he then said It is all right you have got me to rights JAMES HAWKINS policeman G 191 I saw Alexander taken and went up into the room—I produce nine shillings which I took out of the three cups and one sixpence which I took from Wilmot s hand when Brannan had seized him and taken him from the table—I also found this paper of red powder on the table JOHN CROOK I am a smith and keep the house 27 George-street—I let the back attic last Michaelmas to a Mrs Fassett—she left 1s deposit—Alexander came the same day or next morning as her husband—he took the room for colouring maps in—he was to pay 2s 6d a week—he said he wanted only one chair and a table to sit at the window—I cannot say whether he told me his name—he said he was the husband of the person who took the room—she went by the name of Fassett—I always knew him as Mr Fassett—he continued to occupy the room till he was taken—he paid me the rent once a fortnight—he did not sleep there to my knowledge—I believe Mrs Fassett used to bring him his meals—I have not myself seen her do so—I do not know Wilmot Cross-examined Q Did Mrs Fassett live there A No—nobody slept in the room to my knowledge—Mrs Fassett said she took the room for Mr Fassett to colour maps in—I made the agreement with her—when Alexander came he said it was a nice little room and would suit him very well—I do not know when I saw him next—I have seen him come down stairs at times—I never saw him in the room except when he agreed about it HARRIET SQUIRES I am married I occupied a room on the same floor with the prisoners—I have seen Alexander come backwards and forwards to the back attic since last Oct and Wilmot for about a fortnight—I have not seen them together—I do not know how long they were there at any time Cross-examined Q Did you ever see a woman there A Yes—she was not very often in the room—I was never there COURT Q You never saw Wilmot till within a fortnight of the time he was taken A No—sometimes I did not see them for a day or two and sometimes two or three time a day ALFRED SMEE I am the author of a work entitled The Art of Working in Metals —my attention has been particularly drawn to that subject—these articles produced are four voltaic batteries with wires which have a plate of silver attached to one end of them and zinc on the other—one end is bend and has evidently received a deposit of silver—the object of this apparatus is to supply the voltaic force to pass through a solution containing silver and to deposit silver—these four cups would be for the purpose of receiving such a solution to deposit on any other metal—any metallic substance inserted in the solution would be at once coated by this process with silver—the solution produced by the officer stated to have been in the battery contains a mixture od sulphuric acid and sulphate of zinc—the sulphate of zinc would arise in the action of the battery sulphuric acid being required to charge the battery—the solution in the cup would produce the same effect being acted upon by the voltaic battery—it contains silver—this sixpence taken from Wilmot s hand is evidently coated with silver so deposited—these three sixpences found in one of the cups have evidently been in but a very short period—the process was just commencing—I cannot judge how long they had been subjected to the process as that would depend on the strength of the charge—there is a greater deposit on the first sixpence than on these—they might have been put in at different times or if put in at the same time might have a different amount of silver on them—they are evidently base—the first is not silver bending it —I have torn off some of the silver and the base metal underneath can be distinctly seen—I should think that sixpence could not have arrived at that stage in less than a quarter of an hour or ten minutes but it is a doubtful point—the things produced are quite complete for the purpose of silvering base metal—I put one of the solutions into the of the batteries and another into one of the cups and put into it one of the half-crowns produced by Brannan uncovered and I got this distinct deposit of silver on it—these shillings are all covered with silver deposited by the voltaic agency—they are quite complete—judging from the solution not containing a large quantity of silver I think the process must have been conducted rather slowly at any rate a quarter of an hour or even longer—I was about two hours casing the half-crown but there was very little solution—these sixpences found on the table have been subjected to the same process—they are perfectly covered and are very well done—they would of course be wet when taken out of the cup CALEB EDWARD POWELL These twelve sixpences are counterfeit Wilmot s Defence I am a shore-maker I was directed by Alexander to come up to his place on Saturday morning for a pair of boots to repair Alexander and another man were there I told him I had come for the pair of boots he said Very well if you will wait here a few moments I will go and fetch them he went out and the other man immediately followed I then looked about the room and saw things which I did not think was right I attempted to go out but found the door fastened outside the room was very close I pulled my coat and hat off and went to look at the table when the

t18480703-1718  1718 THOMAS JOHNSON and SARAH JOHNSON feloniously having in their possession moulds for coining counterfeit shillings MESSRS BODKIN and PLATT conducted the Prosecution JAMES BRANNAN police-sergeant G 20 On Monday 22nd May about noon I went with four other officers to the second-floor of No I New-court Great Wild-street Drury-lane—I directed Hughes to remain in the court to stand by the door under the second-floor window—he would command a view of that window—the street-door was open—we went up to the second-floor room and commenced battering the door which was strongly barricaded—there was a door nailed to the usual door with large spikes to make it thicker and more difficult to enter and against that door these large pieces of wood produced to go from the door to the wall on the other side—after considerable difficulty we got in and Neville and Swanson secured the prisoners who were in the room—Thomas was standing with his shirt-sleeves tucked up above his elbows and a frying-pan in his hand—Sarah was standing close to the window which was open—there is but one room on a floor—before we got in I heard a noise resembling the breaking of glass and ordered Harvey to go down in the court to Hughes whom I had left there to watch—on entering the room I observed this earthenware pipkin on a clear fire with white metal in it which had been recently upset with the metal pouring from it through the fire—I saw a tub containing water which I immediately emptied on the fire—I then commenced picking up the metal which poured through the fire—this is it—I believe it is Britannia metal—on the hob I saw an iron pot which contained metal not in a fluid state but quite hot I could hardly bold the spoon—it appears to have been melted but left there to cool—under the stove I found another iron spoon and this knife on a table close to the fire with plaster of Paris adhering to one of the blades and on the same table a pair of scissors and two files one of them with white metal in its teeth—on a shelf in the room I found a quantity of copper wire having a silvery appearance as if used in the galvanic battery and under the table three tin bands for forming plaster of Paris moulds with plaster adhering to them—I searched Thomas and found in his right breeches pocket three good shillings produced and 2 1/2 d in copper—I ordered the prisoners to be taken to the station in consequence of a mob being assembled—I went with Harvey down stairs—I got a candle and went down to the cellar but found nothing—I saw the plaster under the stairs was broken within six or seven feet of the cellar-door—I put my hand into the hole and found three parcels wrapped up separately in paper—one of them contained a mould for casting half-crowns and the other two double moulds for casting shillings—some stuff was spilled on the table in the confusion and some of it got spilled on the shillings—before that they were perfectly bright—I showed them to the man and afterwards showed him the moulds and told him where I found them—he made no reply Cross-examined by MR BRIARLY Q The street-door was open A Yes—these moulds were on that part of the stair-case that led to the cellar in a part to which any one might have access—one of the shillings found on Thomas did not correspond with the moulds—two of them did JAMES NEVILLE policeman G 152 I accompanied Brannan when the door was forced—I saw Thomas with the frying-pan in his hand—the table was about a yard and a half from the fire—there was a bed and bedstead in the room—I was the first who seized the man—he said Deal with me fairly treat me as a man BENJAMIN SWANSON policeman 172 G I accompanied Brannan and the other officers and took Sarah standing near the window with a wet cloth in her hand JOSEPH SAMUEL HUGHES policeman 114 E I was in front of the house—in a short time I heard the noise of breaking a door—on the first blow I heard the breaking of glass—I looked up to the window which was open and Saw several glass bottles thrown out—some came near me and others went over a wall on the roof of some stables—I saw some jars come out—I could see the prisoners standing in that room with the officers—Harvey came down—we searched and just over the wall I found this part of a galvanic battery plate and some copper wire—there was nothing in the jars that I could retain—they were broken and the bottles too—I went up to the room and found this file on the floor and on the mantel-piece under a saltcellar this shilling—I found this handkerchief with a hole burnt in it JOHN HARVEY policeman 118 G I was with the other officers—I joined Hughes and went to the back of the stable-yard—I found part of a jar part of a galvanic battery plate and some wire to it which appeared to have been silvered and two necks of bottles which smelt of sulphur—they were six or seven yards from the window EDWARD SPEECHLEY I am a broker at Great Wild-street On Tuesday 16th May Thomas came to my house and took the second-floor room of No 1 New-court—he was to pay 3s 6d a week—he paid 2s deposit—on 22nd May I saw both prisoners in custody—these pieces of wood were not there when they took the room—neither the wood nor any of these things belong to me Cross-examined Q You let three rooms in that house A Yes—there are no back-rooms—other persons lodge in the house—the staircase was open to persons living in the house—I keep the cellar in my own occupation it is locked CALEB EDWARD POWELL I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint This mould is plaster of Paris and is for casting counterfeit shillings—this is a good shilling and appears to have been used for making this mould—it corresponds with one of this impression of 1820 of George the Third s reign—I have no doubt it made this mould—there are some defects on it which must have occurred after coining—those defects I find represented on the mould—this other mould is for casting two counterfeit shillings at the same time—one is an impression of George the Third s 1816—this other shilling was the model for making that mould—this other is a Victoria one—this shilling found on the mantel-piece is counterfeit—these pipkins are used for melting metal—this appears to be Britannia metal which is generally used in casting counterfeit shillings—they use the galvanic battery for covering these coins with silver this copper wire is part of it—these bunds are used for making moulds —these files knife and scissors are used in the preparation of coin Thomas Johnson s Defence I throw myself on the mercy of the Court this female had only been with me three days she is perfectly ignorant of it she never saw the moulds to my knowledge she was never at home but at meal times THOMAS JOHNSON *—

there—he asked for twopenny worth of gin and a drop of cold water—I served him—he gave me a half-crown in payment—I gave him a shilling two sixpences and a fourpenny-piece in change—he stopped but a very few minutes after he got the change—I put the half-crown into a cup in the till in the bar—there was no other half-crown there—the prisoner was brought back again in about half-an-hour by Mr Pither the policeman and another man—I gave the half-crown to the policeman before he went after the prisoner—it had been locked in the till and I had the key in my possession all the time Prisoner Q What money was there in the cup A I cannot say exactly—there were two or three shillings and two or three sixpences—there was no one in the bar but myself—my mistress came in while I was serving you—I do not recollect any one but you being served at the bar—there was no man in a smock-frock—I believe my mistress did serve a gentleman with a pint of beer—I do not know what money he gave her or what change she gave him—I believe he gave her some pence—my master had the half-crown in his hand and rang it on the counter and I then took it up and gave it to the policeman—it was not out of my sight COURT Q What money was kept in the cup A Silver only the copper was put in the till generally—I am sure there was only one half-crown in the till THOMAS WHEATLEY PITHER I keep the Duke s Head at Bedfont I saw the prisoner in my house about twelve o clock—the policeman Bray afterwards came to the door and in consequence of what he said I spoke to Turner—she unlocked the till in my presence and gave me a half-crown from the cup—there was only one there—I sounded it on the board and gave it back to her—I then went in pursuit of the prisoner—I found him about three quarters of a mile from my house—I took hold of him—he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a purse containing coin—he threw it on the ground—I took it up and put it in my pocket till I saw Bray I then give it to him—it contained fourteen counterfeit half-crowns THOMAS BRAY policeman T 200 I was at Bedfont on 22d Aug —in consequence of something I heard I went to the Duke s Head—I afterwards went in pursuit of the prisoner—I received this bag from Mr Pither it contained fourteen half-crowns—all but two were wrapped up in separate pieces of paper Prisoner Q How far were you from me when Mr Pither stopped me A About thirty yards I saw you throw something away but could not see what it was—it was something light—I saw your hand in your pocket for some time before Mr Pither came up to you—there was another person taken up on suspicion of passing bad money and a third man was stopped and examined by Mr Pither and another person—I did not suspect him—the person who was taken into custody besides you was Joseph Scales—he was taken before the Magistrate next morning—he was about 100 yards from you at the time Mr Pither stopped you MR BODKIN Q How was that person dressed A In a drab coat and dark striped trowsers not in a smock frock—he was remanded and afterwards fetched back and discharged—he had passed a bad half-crown to a person at another place JOHN KEMPSTER I am in the In-tellers Office in the Bank of England I have examined the half-crowns produced—there are four among those produced by Bray dated 1845 and ten of 1817—the one produced by Turner is dated 1845—they are all bad—I cannot positively say whether any of them were cast in the same mould with the one in question—they appear all to be made with the same metal Britannia metal—I am not in the Mint—I am sent from the Bank—I cannot tell whether any of them have been cast in the same mould I should think it would be impossible for any one to say—all I can say is that they are bad Prisoner s Defence I positively deny the charge on 22d Aug I was going to Egham races I had nearly 2l —worth of silver in my pocket I went into Pither s house for a drop of gin I gave no half-crown at all it was a shilling and I received sixpence and a fourpenny-piece in change whilst standing at the bar a man came out of the tap-room for a pint of beer and was served by the mistress he gave her some money and received some silver in change I cannot positively swear what it was I saw a shilling and sixpence perfectly I then came out and proceeded along the road towards Egham when I got about a mile and a half on the road Mr Pither came behind me collared me and charged me with having passed some bad money at his house and about two minutes after the policeman came up and took me I walked a few paces when he returned back a short distance and picked up something what it was I do not know he returned and said he had picked up a bag and accused me of having thrown it away the man who was taken into custody at the same time I was was not above five yards from me at the time in the custody of a butcher who had collared him by the policeman s order on suspicion of passing bad money and he was identified as having passed a bad half-crown at another public-house he was just as likely to throw away the bag as me the policeman took my money from me so that I have not been able to get counsel THOMAS BRAY re-examined I found on him four half-crowns seven shillings four sixpences and four fourpenny-pieces all good—that was loose in his pocket—Scales was going in the same direction as the prisoner—I should say he was 100 yards from the prisoner or it might be rather more when he threw away the bag—I am positive the prisoner threw it down—it was impossible that Scales could have done it—I saw the prisoner throw it out of his hand and saw it fall to the ground ELIZA TURNER re-examined I am sure it was not a shilling I received from the prisoner—it was a half-crown and I gave him a shilling two six-pences and a fourpenny-piece GUILTY — Transported for Seven Years Before Mr Justice Williams

been in circulation Cross-examined Q Just look at the one with a cross on it is that a good imitation of a lion shilling A I should say not I am a clerk in the Bank of England—this one looking at one produced by Mr Payne is good—I can tell the difference by the feel of it—one is dark and heavy-looking—there is as much difference in them as between cut glass and that from a mould HOMAN— GUILTY Aged

t18491217-226  226 ANN ELIZABETH PHELPS feloniously making counterfeit coin MESSRS ELLIS and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JOSEPH THOMPSON police-sergeant F 11 On 4th Dec about six o clock in the evening in consequence of information I stationed myself on the roof of the Model Lodging-house Charles-street Drury-lane from whence I had a view of the front room of No 48 on the other side of the street—there was a candle on the table—I saw the prisoner blowing the fire—I went again next evening and saw the prisoner sitting at the side of the table with something like a mould in her hand—she took something like a small bowl from the fire and poured something like metal into the mould in two places—she held it in her hand a few seconds opened the mould and turned out on the table what appeared to me to be two shillings—I saw her do that perhaps a dozen times or more—two men and another woman in a cloak and bonnet were in the room—one man took something and appeared to scour it and then sent it across the table to another man who appeared to file it by the movements of his arm—one of the men then went to this pot a galvanic battery —when they had done a certain quantity and counted them over one man who was without his coat gave the other who wore a cap some money two pieces or more—he handed them over to the woman in the bonnet who put them into a basket I believe I could not exactly see but she had a basket—the man without the coat turned the money over and put it into his left-hand trowsers -pocket—he appeared to me as if he had purchased them—the woman in the bonnet and shawl and the man in the cap left the room—the prisoner stayed still going on with the same process—in a few minutes the man without the coat turned down his shirt-sleeves buttoned up his clothes and went out of the room—he returned in a very few minutes pulled off his coat and sat down by the side of the table and commenced rubbing some of the coin—I then left the parapet—I was gone about ten or twelve minutes and returned with several officers and a ladder which I rose to the window I had been watching—I went up first with a crow-bar—the prisoner was sitting at the side of the table with something in her hand like a mould—I forced open the window and sprung into the room—she jumped up threw down this mould produced with a piece of cloth round it and two sixpences in it and screamed out—the man was not there—she came towards me to shove me I suppose but I got into the room and was followed by Sergeants West and Dunston—I dragged her from the fireplace to the table and gave her into Dunston s custody—there was a bright fire on which was this spoon with white metal in it in a fluid state—on the hob I found two moulds one with two impressions of shillings and one for half-crowns—on the table were twenty-three sixpences and two in the mould she threw down also this electrotype-battery this spoon and part of another spoon this acid in a bottle these thin pieces of silver a piece of glass which has the appearance of a mould of two sixpences having been made on it and these six pieces of timber which screw together over the door and it was shored up at the bottom it would be impossible to get in it was not screwed then—it is a frame made the exact height of the room and pieces to go across produced —I asked her where the Doctor was—she said she knew nothing about any doctor no one lived there but her—one of the men I had seen in the room goes by the name of the Doctor—I knew him before Prisoner He said he saw a woman in a bonnet and cloak and now he says it was a bonnet and shawl the whole of your evidence is false Witness I believe it was a shawl but it was very dark— the witness s deposition being read agreed with his present evidence WILLIAM WEST police-sergeant V 7 I accompanied sergeant Thompson and Dunston—we waited in Park-street—Thompson joined us and we went to 48 Charles-street and raised the ladder—I followed Thompson in at the second-floor window—Dunston was behind me—Thompson took the prisoner and delivered her to Dunston—I found this saucepan with white metal in it cold—it had been melted—these five or six files were on the table—two of them have white metal on the teeth—I found some whitening on the mantleshelf in a piece of paper with a tooth-brush without a handle in it IRA DUNSTON policeman V 53 I got in at the window last—I found this white pot containing plaister of Paris a teacup containing a small quantity of sand and water and five counterfeit half-crowns of the same year as the moulds produced—the prisoner was given into my custody—I took her away Prisoner You are not the man who had me it was a much taller man he used me most shamefully and laid my head open with an iron crow-bar here is the mark on my eye now he threw me on the bed and said Gag her and you two know the man and said Don t ill use her so Witness I know nothing of it—I did not know that you were beaten—I did not see blood flowing from your head as I took you to the station JOSEPH THOMPSON re-examined She was so violent it took Dunston and another man to hold her—they said they would gag her if she was not quiet—she kept calling for water—we gave her some—she said she was going to have a fit in a minute—I did not tee Dunston strike her—I hit her on the head with a bar as I got into the room because she tried to push me out of the window when I was on the ladder—the other man was a constable of the A division—I do not know his number—he came in at the door—I can find him in a minute JOHN RICHARDS I am agent to Charles Paternoster the landlord of 48 Charles-street Drury-lane I live there—on 16th Nov I let the prisoner the room which has been spoken of No 6—she went by the name of Polly Firelock—she paid 3s 6d a week 7d nightly and nothing on Sunday—she always paid me—before that she lived in No 6 room of 2 Smith s-court Prisoner Q You did not see my door screwed up in this manner A No but I was only in the room once—the timber was then on the floor—that was on the 18th two days after you came WILLIAM WEBSTER I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint This sixpence of William IV 1834 and of Victoria 1844 were cast in this mould with the cloth round it—here are twenty-three sixpences from it—here are two unfinished with the get on them —the one mould serves for the two different sixpences—here is a mould for half-crowns—in my judgment these five half-crowns were cast in it—here is another mould for a shilling of George III and William IV but there are no impressions from it—the coins are all Britannia metal—this part of a spoon and this melted metal are Britannia metal—I do not understand the battery—these files sand and plaister of Paris are all useful in the preparation of counterfeit coin Prisoner s Defence Thompson s evidence is quite false I had quarrelled and fought with a woman and she said she would do for me on another day on the Monday night before I was taken I was very tipsy and was standing at the corner of Charles-street when Tom Ansell whom she lives with who makes and passes this sort of money said I will transport you for ten or fifteen years and will get 2l 10s for doing it on the Tuesday I was very ill from the drink I went out with a woman to pledge a pair of boots when I came back I found the coins put on my table and the window went up and I was knocked down and struck with an iron crow-bar and handcuffed I was tipsy on the Monday when Thompson says he saw me making the coin I saw Thompson take out his handkerchief with something in it wipe his face with it and lay something on the table he pulled the moulds from his pocket ran to the fire and said I have got the moulds hurrah ten of them they have put in all

of information I went at six o clock in the evening to the top of the Model lodging-house in Charles-street Drury-lane which is opposite to No 48—I could see into the second-floor room at 48—In consequence of what I saw I went again the next evening about the same time and saw the prisoner sitting by the table and a female by the side of the fire holding something in her left hand which appeared to be a mould—she took something from the fire which appeared to be a small ladle—the prisoner poured something white into two places in the thing the woman held in her left hand—it appeared to be metal—after holding it a few seconds she opened it and turned out on the table what appeared to be some small white coin—she did that several times—the prisoner was sitting at the table and he appeared to be filing and rubbing what appeared to be shillings which the woman turned out of the thing in her hand—a man with a cap on and a woman with a bonnet and shawl and basket came into the room while this process was going on—after they had done a certain quantity the prisoner went to this pot producing a galvanic battery and did something to it—after that the prisoner took up the pieces in his hand rubbed them more gently than before and laid them on the table—when he had done a certain quantity he handed them to the woman with the bonnet—she looked at them and handed them to the man—he looked at them returned them and the woman then gave the prisoner some money more than one piece which he turned over in his hand and put into his left-hand trowsers pocket—the man and woman then left the room—the prisoner turned down his shirt-sleeves put on his coat and went out with them or directly after them—while he was absent the woman kept pouring out the liquor—he came back

two sixpences in it when it was picked up—Durston and West followed me into the room—we searched the place and on the hob I found these moulds of half-crown impressions and these two shilling moulds—this white metal was on the fire in a fluid state—on the table I found twenty-three sixpences and the mould I had seen the female throw down with the two sixpences in it—I found this spoon and the portion of another one—this electro-battery was on the table—on the mantelpiece I found this glass with the impression of two sixpences on it as if a mould had been made on it and also some small silver which is used for electro-plating and two bottles of acid all produced —a quarter of an hour had not elapsed from my leaving the top of the house and getting in at the window—I have known the prisoner for two or three years—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man I saw—I had seen him in the room on two or three prior occasions from the same place—I had him in custody three years ago—I took him into custody on 3rd Jan which was the first time I saw him after this—I told him he was charged with Ann Phelps then convicted for making counterfeit coin—he said he knew nothing about it—I found in the room this frame like a large gridiron produced which fits against the door and has two struts which run out against it so that it is impossible to get into the room without knocking the wall down WILLIAM WEST policeman F 7 I went with Thompson and assisted in putting the ladder against the window—I got into the room and found six files two of which have white metal between the teeth—they appeared to have been used very recently—I found also some whitening part of a tooth-brush and a spoon with some metal in it near the fireplace IRA DURSTON policeman F 53 I found five counterfeit half-crowns a white jar containing plaster-of-Paris and a teacup containing sand and water JOHN RICHARDS I reside at 48 Charles-street Drury-lane and am deputy-landlord of this house In Sept last the prisoner took a room No 2 Smith s-court and lived with Ann Phelps who was convicted last Session when I was present—Phelps afterwards took a front-room two-pair at 48 Charles-street and I have seen the prisoner in the room with her—there was no such timber as this in the room when I let it Prisoner Q Have you ever seen me in the room A Once or twice the first time I saw you there you were at tea with the female—I was only in the room twice while Phelps lived there and each time saw you there WILLIAM WEBSTER I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint—these thirteen sixpences of William IV are all counterfeit and from the mould produced—they are made of Britannia metal the same metal as this spoon—there are also eleven sixpences of Victoria which were cast in this other mould—there are two impressions in the same mould one Victoria and the other William IV —this galvanic apparatus is used for silvering the Britannia metal after it is made into coin—it is also necessary to use acids but I do not know the nature of them—I know that silver is used and is dissolved by the acid—I should say the silver leaf now produced is the kind necessary—this piece of glass would be to lay the sixpences on to form the mould—the sixpence is oiled over and laid on the glass a piece of paste-board is placed round the glass and the plaster poured on to the sixpence Prisoner s Defence I did not live with the woman while she was in Charles-street when she went there I went to live in Whitechapel the landlord said at the police station he only saw me in the room once and now he says twice the policeman never saw me in the room how could he see across a road thirty feet wide into a room on the opposite side of the way so as to speak to me I am brought here to get the reward through the Mint GUILTY * Aged 22 — Transported for Ten Years There was another indictment against the prisoner

BAYLEY conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM FRY I am a builder of the Walworth-road—I know the house 36 Queen s-row Walworth—Mr Urrey is the owner of it—I was employed to let it and the prisoner came to inquire the terms in the early part of Sept —he took it of Mr Urrey and took possession about 9th Sept —I had a letter from Mr Urrey to give him the key and did so—the rent was to commence on the 29th—he was to pay quarterly—I saw him in possession and he occupied it nearly three months—the key was returned to me by the Parcels Delivery Company five or six days after Christmas-day—he paid no rent and carried on no business except selling a few coals Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Were you before the Magistrate A No—the last time I saw the prisoner there was 22nd Nov —I live nearly opposite—I saw his wife and family there but no lodgers—I do not turn any corner to get there from my house—I cannot see the house only the steps but I pass six or ten times a day and never knew there were lodgers ELIZA SIMMS I live at 35 Queen s-row and am barmaid to my brother at the Pilgrim public-house The prisoner came there in Sept and said he was a glazier and was about to become the next door neighbour and if anybody asked for Mr Thomas he was the person and that he was expecting some furniture—he called several times to know if any one had been to ask for him—he asked me if my brother wanted to purchase some coals that he was going to open in the coal business and chandler s shop way and his wife and himself were to carry it on and he was to do the glazing business—the previous tenant was a painter and glazier and there was Painter and glazier over the door it was never taken down—I saw a cart come it might be a day or two before or a day or two after that conversation—it brought a tea-chest a chair or two a table and an old mattrass—he had told me his furniture was coming by a van—I saw no van come with any furniture—I asked him on several occasions whether he was about opening—he said he had been very busy and had not had time but he should do so in a short time—he had opened in the coal trade but not in the chandlery way—the shop was kept shut up all but two shutters—the coals were in a cellar underneath—there was an outside trap-door—the last time I saw him was one Tuesday or Wednesday night when he came to take a light at our gas and went out and I saw him go down the trap into the cellar—Smith the constable came next day or the following Saturday—I saw the prisoner s wife and children come home in a cab about half-past nine in the evening—there was no one in the house in the mean time to my knowledge—the house was shut up barring the shutters—the shutter of the shop door was always kept down—the prisoner used to call every day sometimes twice a-day but I never saw him in a working dress Cross-examined Q Did you visit the house A I never went into it—I can see everything from our window and never saw any van or furniture except what I describe—if there had been I must have seen it—I was never out above an hour WILLIAM SMITH policeman P 32 On Thursday 29th Nov I received information and went to 36 Queen s-row Walworth—I did not find the prisoner there—the shop was closed—I watched it off and on for five days and nights and he did not come there—the wife came on the Saturday night at half-past nine o clock and remained until 8th Dec when they removed away early in the morning and left the house shut up—she took with her a mattress a chair or two a table and a weighing-machine—I then ceased to watch JOHN FELLOWS I live at 4 West-street Walworth-road On Sunday 25th Nov between eight and nine in the evening I was in the Good Intent East-lane Walworth kept by Mr Jeffery—I saw the prisoner in the parlour among other persons—after I had been there a little while he said he had been round the neighbourhood and could not get change for a 10l -note and he had got a party to pay some money to outside and would give any one a shilling that would get the change—he put it on the table—I took it and went to four places and then to the Sir William Walworth kept by Mr Howland who 1 have known for years—I gave it to him and he gave me for it a 5l -note four sovereigns and one pound in silver—I returned and gave the change to the prisoner—he gave me one shilling for getting change—he had something to drink—on the following Friday Mr Howland brought the note to my house alleging it to be forged Cross-examined Q Did you remember before the Magistrate that you were promised the shilling A Yes I did not mention it—Mr Howland put my name on the note—he knew my name and address JAMES JEFFERYS I keep the Good Intent East-street Walworth On Sunday evening 25th Nov the prisoner came with a 10l -note in his hand—he asked me to change it and said he never saw such a d—d poor place as this that he had been to a dozen houses and could not get change—I would not give it him and he said he would give anybody a shilling to get him change—Fellows went for it—I saw him return and give the change to the prisoner—next morning the prisoner came into my back yard and asked me what change that old gentleman gave him—I said A 5l -note four sovereigns and small change —he said I have lost the 5l -note —I said You cannot have lost it you are too artful and too cunning to do that — I had seen him twice before when he came in for two half-pints of beer and once he came to ask me to have some coals —he said Never mind light come light go Cross-examined Q Did you give evidence before the Magistrate A No this is the first time I have mentioned the conversation in public—another man was with him and his wife—it was between ten and twelve o clock—he came into the back yard by himself—the other man did not hear the conversation CHARLES CLARIDGE HOWLAND I keep the Sir William Walworth On Sunday evening 25th Nov a little before nine o clock Fellows brought me this 10l -note produced —I wrote on it Mr Fellows West-street Walworth and gave him a 5l -note four sovereigns and 1l worth of silver—next day I paid it to Mr Gurney of Islington—I received it back from him on Thursday the 29th I believe JOSHUA FREEMAN I am inspector of Bank notes in the Bank of England This note is a forgery in paper plate and signature— read—Bank of England No 15454—I promise to pay to Mr Matthew Marshall or bearer 10l for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England J Cann —there is a clerk named Cann who signs notes—it would pass in the world—there is no water-mark—there is a mark by pressure—it is not Bank paper JOHNSTON EDDINGTON I keep the Artichoke at Camberwell A twelve-month or two years previous to Nov last I had seen the prisoner at my house but I did not know him when he came in—I had a regular customer named William Thomas who I have known about twenty years—between six and seven o clock on the evening of 25th Nov the prisoner came and asked for Mr Thomas his uncle I said he had not come yet but I expected him—he said he wanted particularly to see him for he wanted to leave him 2l —I said if he liked to stop a short time his uncle would be there—he said he was very much pushed for time—I offered to take the 2l —he said he could not do that unless I changed him a 10l -note and he put the note into my hand—I did not like the feel of the paper and handed it to my wife as I cannot see well without my glasses—she said she thought it was good and I gave the prisoner 8l for it and was to give 2l to his nncle—when I went up for the change I left the note with the prisoner and when I came down I saw his name on it—this is it produced —here is Caleb Thomas on the back of it—I locked it up—I was to tell his uncle that 30s of the 2l was to be sent to his daughter in the country to bring her home—I paid the note away on Wednesday the 28th and on the Saturday following Dec 1st it was brought back by Mr Potter as a forgery Cross-examined Q Did you see the uncle after you discovered it was a forgery A Yes about an hour afterwards and told him so and gave him the two sovereigns—he is a gardener I have known him twenty years JOSHUA FREEMAN re-examined This note is a forgery and is for the same amount and of the same number and date and signature as the other—I have no doubt they are both impressions from the same plate—the Bank do not issue two notes of the same value number and date Cross-examined Q the same person signs a good many notes A Yes note read SARAH EDDINGTON I am the wife of the last witness I handed the prisoner a pen and ink and saw him write his name on the note while my husband was gone upstairs to get the change—this is the note JOHN WILLIAM FITCH I am a grocer in Crosby-row Walworth-road On Saturday 24th Nov the prisoner came to my house about nine or ten o clock in the evening and asked for 1lb of black tea—I asked if I should send it for him—he said yes I might—I took the order in a waste-book it came to 10s 2d —he gave his address 36 Queen s-row Walworth—he took a 5l -note out of his pocket and handed it to me in payment—I held it up to the gas and examined it—he looked at me at the time I examined it and said Look at it well —I wrote his name and address on it—I asked him his name he had given me his address before as the place I was to send the goods to this is the note produced —I gave him the difference taking the amount of the goods out—I afterwards sent the goods to the address he gave me and they were taken in by a female—I paid the note away on the Monday and on the Wednesday I believe it was returned to me as a forged note—I am quite sure this is the same I gave change for—I then went to the station and communicated with Sergeant Smith—we went together to see if we could find Mr Thomas and could not—we sent some one to knock at the door and could not get any one to answer it—there was no one there Cross-examined Q He told you to examine it well to see if it was a good one A Yes—I did not remark that I wished I had a thousand such—I did not make any remark—I supposed it to be good or I should not have taken it—I do not know that I looked at it more minutely in consequence of his saying Look at it well MR FREEMAN re-examined This note is a forgery in all respects paper plate signature and water-mark—it purports to be signed by Mr Pasquet—he is a cashier in the Bank and signs 5l -notes—this note appears to be of the same sort of paper as the other—the water-mark has been attempted to be done in the same way by pressure JOHN CASTLE I keep the City of Salisbury in Lock s-fields Walworth On Friday 23rd Nov the prisoner came there I think between twelve and one o clock—he asked for change for a 5l -note gave one to my wife and she brought it to me—I had seen the prisoner drinking at my house two or three times before—I said I would give him change and asked his name and address—he gave the name of Thomas and I forget the address—I wrote the name and address he gave me on the note—this is my writing on this note— produced —it is the name and address he gave me Mr Thomas No 36 Queen s-row Walworth —I gave him the full change for it—I kept in three or four days or a week in my cash-box and then paid it to my distiller—in three or four days after it came back to me marked forged —I went to the prisoner s house and could not find him—I saw his wife I believe and she said he was not at home—I did not see anything in the house in the shape of furniture the shop was quite empty—I afterwards attended at the Lambeth Police-court when the prisoner was under examination—my deposition was taken down by the clerk in the presence and hearing of the prisoner—I do not remember the prisoner saying anything MR CLARKSON proposed to give parol evidence of an exclamation made by the prisoner while the clerk was taking down the deposition of the witness not before the Magistrate but in a private room MR PAYNE objected to this as the deposition alone was evidence of what passed before the Magistrate and if this was not in the Magistrate s presence it could not be admissable the clerk having no authority to act in his absence MR JUSTICE TALFOURD was of opinion that the evidence was admissable it was not part of the prisoner s statement as to which the statute applied and it was not excluded on any other ground JOHN HARVEY police-sergeant G 14 I have known the prisoner seven or eight years—in consequence of information I received in the early part of Dec I went in search of him—I searched after him till 8th Jan when at eleven o clock at night I went with Sergeant Steadman to the tap-room of a beer-shop in Pear Tree-street St Luke s called the Blue Lion where there was a number of men and among them the prisoner—I knew several of the men—I said to the prisoner How do you do Mr Thomas —he said My name is not Thomas —I then said You enjoy yourself better than you did when you kept a shop in Golden-lane —he made no answer—I said I knew you too when you kept a beer-shop in New Inn-yard —he said Yes I did —Knight said Oh I knew Mr Harvey when I was a little boy to which the prisoner replied Oh I remember him when I kept this beer-shop —I then called him to the front of the bar outside and told him that I wanted him for passing forged notes fives and tens at Walworth—he said he did not know anything about it—I said I suspected him to be the man and he must go to the station with me—on the way to the station he wanted to go home to take his wife the key—he did not tell me where his house was—I told him I should not let him go—on that he said Well it is no use to deceive you I have been made a dupe of and I have lost 45l by it —he said he had been engaged by a countryman to change these notes for him and he told him that he would put him into business or lend him some money to start in business—he said he was glad I had come for he had been out of the way for about five weeks and he was sick of it—he said if the case was not exposed in the papers he would soon find the right party—I searched him at the station and found the latch-key of his house—he gave his address 16 Peartree-street and asked me to take the key—I did so and found it was the Blue Lion beer-shop where 1 had taken him from—he had not said a word about lodging there when I first took him—I found from the landlord that he did not live there—the prisoner was remanded from 9th Jan to the 14th—I attended the second examination—as I passed him as he was in the dock he said to me How came you to say that you took me from among thirty or forty swindlers as stated in the Times newspaper —I said I know nothing about the Times —he said he should complain to the Magistrate—he did not do so—I noticed to him that his whiskers were shaved off—he said he need not have done that for he owned that he passed the notes—he said he should brine parties forward to prove where he had the notes from and bring his uncle forward Cross-examined Q Did you recollect all these statements of the prisoner s when you gave evidence before the Magistrate A I recollected them but they did not take them all down they put down the principal part—it was in the clerk s office that he said he should bring his uncle forward at the last examination I believe—the Magistrate was not present—that was not said in answer to any question by the clerk—I believe it was said to one of the witnesses—he said it loud enough for the clerk to hear and I believe the clerk told him if he had anything to say he had better mention it by and by MR FREEMAN re-examined The last note produced is a forgery in every respect—it is not from the same plate as the other five—it appears the same sort of paper and the water-mark appears done in the same way by pressure MR PAYNE to MR CASTLES Q I believe you are not sure about the day whether it was the Friday or Saturday A No I am not—it was in the morning between twelve and one o clock as near as I can recollect—I never said positively it was Friday I said somewhere about the 23rd GUILTY Aged 39 — Transported for Ten Years Before Edward Bullock Esq

loaf he gave me 6d I gave him 5d change and he went away—I laid the sixpence on a ledge on the till where I am sure there were no others—directly he was gone a constable came in and my sister gave him the sixpence from the same place—there were no other sixpences near—my sister and I marked the sixpence and I gave it to the constable—no one had been to the till after the prisoner went out and before the constable came in Prisoner Q Was there not a man went in before me with a sixpence A Yes—I laid that on the ledge and when you came in I put that in the till—I did not put yours in the till with that one—the ledge is on the side of the till—we always put the last money on the ledge so that we should know what change to give if there is any dispute—I gave the other man 5d change—the policeman did not tell me before the Magistrate If you say what I told you before we came here you will make a case of it but if you do not the man will get remanded —he did not tell me what to say—he did not say a word to me ISABELLA HAYES I am sister of the lost witness and was in the shop when the prisoner came in for the penny loaf and when the man came before—if we receive any coin our practice is to lay it on the ledge inside the till until we give change and it remains there till another customer comes in—my sister served the first man—I did not see her place the sixpence on the ledge—she served the prisoner and laid the sixpence she took from him on the ledge—when the constable came in consequence of what he said I looked at the ledge and the same sixpence my sister had taken was there—I marked it and gave it to the officer—this is it produced Prisoner Q What were you doing when I went into the shop A Scrubbing the counter—I saw your face—I did not say you were not the man or that I did not notice you—I marked the sixpence before I let the policeman have it—I said it was bad before I took it off the ledge—I could not see it was bad when you laid it on the counter—I could see it was a sixpence MARY HARRISON I am the wife of George Harrison My sister Jane Martin keeps a tobacconist s shop—I do not serve there but I went there on Thursday 11th March and served in the shop—the prisoner came in and asked for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—I served him—he gave me a sixpence and I gave him 5d change—he went away and directly afterwards the officer came

duty at St Pancras and saw the prisoner in company with a man and woman—I saw him go to Mr Hayes take a penny loaf and tender a sixpence on the counter—he came out went and joined the man and woman and passed something to the man—they then went on together towards Mrs Martin s shop and I observed the woman give the prisoner something and he went to Mrs Martin s shop and purchased some tobacco—I saw him pay a sixpence for it—when he came out I followed him to the corner of Battle-bridge where they all three ran away as fast as they could—the others got away and I secured the prisoner and said Feeny I want you for passing two bad sixpences —he said Me pass two had sixpences I have not passed any to-day —I took him to the station searched him and found on him a penny loaf but no money—there was time enough for him to get rid of the money when he joined the man and woman—he walked some distance with them—I produce the two sixpences one from Hayes and the other from Miss Harrison—they were both marked before I had them Prisoner Q You saw the three of us run away A Yes directly I came up you made a start and I caught you by the collar when you had run about half a dozen steps—when I told you it was for passing two bad sixpences you said you had not a tanner that day—I took you to one of the shops and you said you had not been there all day—I did not take you when you came out of the second shop because I was following you with a view of getting a third piece but I came upon you accidentally round a corner and directly you saw me you bolted off—I saw you give a sixpence for the penny loaf—I was seven or eight yards from the shop at the time—I did not take you when you came out of the first shop because I could not get any assistance—I asked some persons to run after the man and woman but they would not WILLIAM WEBSTER I am inspector of coin to the Mint These two sixpences are counterfeit—they appear to have come from the same mould but one is so much worse an impression

conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM SOUNS I am a die-sinker in Rupert-street Haymarket On Thursday 23rd Jan O Shea came to my house between ten and eleven o clock in the morning—my son handed me this note and said in his presence that he had received it from O Shea— read — Sir I want to know whether you would have the goodness to make a cast for two half-crowns and if you do what you will charge you will be paid liberally and faithfully and depend upon the strictest secrecy —I read the note and asked O Shea what he wanted—he said a mould to make half-crowns—I appeared surprised and told him that was decidedly wrong—he said We know it is not right but we want to make them —he said they wanted to pass them—I asked him to describe what he wanted—he said his comrade was outside who could explain it better than he could—I requested him to fetch him—he did so and Mulcharey came in—I said to him I suppose you are aware what is wanted here —he said Exactly so —he said he wanted a steel die made for half-crowns—I asked him if it must be in steel—he said O certainly nothing else —I made a sketch on paper and showed it him—he said he wanted it large to make two at once and he made a sketch with two on it and he sketched the mode in which the channel was to be made—O Shea was standing by at the time—Mulcharey described to me the channel that he drew—I undertook to do it after settling about the price which I told them would be about 10l —O Shea offered me 4l and said he could get it done for less in Birmingham but he did not want to go further if I could do it—I at last agreed for the price of 6l —I then asked them how they came to come to me—Mulcharey trailed and said You see we found you out —in subsequent conversation I inquired how they came to me and they said they had a letter from a person in Ireland to an engraver in the same street—there had been an engraver in that street but he is dead—they were to come back on Monday 27th—on the day they first came I went to the police-office and informed the inspector what had taken place—I gave the note and the sketch to the inspector and in consequence of instructions I went on with the proceeding—on Monday 27th Mulcharey came alone in the morning—I had prepared the mould and showed him what I had done—in the evening both the prisoners came and said they wanted it done by Thursday as they wished to return to Cork—Mulcharey said he should be able to put a great many pounds in my pocket that they should want a great deal done in that way and the next mould would be to make sovereigns—I think it was Mulcharey said that—O Shea was there—the prisoners then came almost daily to watch the progress of the mould—on 7th Feb O Shea came alone he saw the mould and he presented to me two Bank of Ireland notes one for 1l and one for 3l —he asked me if I would make-some notes of that description—I told him it could be done and asked him what they were for—he said he could pay the rent to his landlord and he would make them good—he left the notes with me—I had communicated to the inspector about the note and the sketch and I did also about these notes—on Monday 10th Feb I saw both the prisoners about the notes they were anxious to have them done very quickly—O Shea said some of his neighbours were rising rapidly in fortune by forged notes and he wanted a good supply too—he said that they supplied them at 1s 6d each in London and Liverpool But he did not know exactly where to get them and he wished to have plates of his own—I showed them the mould at that time it was nearly finished and they were to come to try it the next evening the 11th—on that evening they both came again and O Shea brought some tin in his pocket which he melted in the ladle and I poured it into the

Q Can you give us any idea how O Shea came to select you A No it was Mulcharey who drew the plan—I told O Shea it was very wrong—I then went on under the direction of the police—O Shea made no secret

Witness O Shea alone introduced the notes and he said to me I have not let my comrade know about the notes I don t think I shall —I said That is your business —when you came together O Shea produced

and POLAND conducted the Prosecution THOMAS RICHARDS police-sergeant M On Wednesday 13th Oct from information I received I went to No 1 Unicorn-court Mint-street with sergeant Wood house and two other constables—we found the street door open and went up to the first floor—we had a little boy with us who knocked at the door—some one inside said Who is there —the boy said It is all right and the door was opened by I believe the prisoner Kelly—I entered alone and saw all the prisoners—Kelly and Fisher were standing up and the two women and Minns were standing round the fire—it is rather a small room the light was in Fisher s hands—it was about half past 6 o clock in the evening the fire was alight—I saw a mould in Kelly s hand when I went into the room—I seized it and took it from him this is it produced —I believe it is only half of a mould it is for a half crown—here is half a crown sticking in it now which I believe is good the head is next to the mould it has never been taken out yet—this pipkin produced was on the fire containing melted metal quite hot—there was a quantity of broken up plaster of Paris on the hearth more than enough to have formed the other half of the mould there was enough to fill a quart pot—I picked up three bad shillings and a sixpence in an unfinished state from among the plaster of Paris on the hearth they were quite warm produced —I found on the mantel piece part of a galvanic battery and a broken Britannia metal spoon—in the cupboard I found an iron ladle—as I entered the room I saw Brown rise up from where she was sitting and run to the foot of the bed—I went there afterwards and found this part of a bad half crown under the bed—I asked Kelly who occupied the room he said he did—when I took hold of Kelly Fisher attempted to run down stairs—he was stopped and brought back—I took the prisoners into custody with the assistance of the other constables—Minns was sitting by the fire for some considerable time I had desired them all to remain where they were—Minns and Field did not move it was close to their feet that I picked up the bad money—one was silting on one side of the fire and one on the other Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q Have you made some inquiries about Minns A No I have known him about Kent-street as a boy—I know nothing against him Kelly Q What was the reason you left the room after coming in A I had received information that underneath that place I should find a great deal of money which was made and I left to find it but could not do so—what I found was in your presence in the room JOHN WOODHOUSE police-sergeant 13 M On 13th Oct I accompanied Richards and the boy to this house—I remained on the stairs after Richards had gone into the room the prisoner Fisher came out in a hurried way I stopped him and took him back—there were two more constables downstairs whom I called up—I searched Fisher found nothing on him and gave him in charge of a constable—I then searched Kelly I saw him put his foot on something and found under his foot a counterfeit shilling—in his pocket I found two good half crowns and two good shillings—there was a table in the room with three bottles on it and a saucer containing sand and a cup with something which appeared like some acid it has not been tested—I took a paper containing plaster of Paris from the table two files a knife and a spoon containing wet plaster of Paris not quite set—there was a very bright fire with a pipkin on it which Sergeant Wright took off—it had some hot metal in it in a fluid state—Field was standing at the corner of the room near the window Minns and Blown were sitting down by the fire—I said to Field What are you doing here —she said I have nothing to do with them I have only come to see them make it Cross-examined Q I believe you know something of Minns A Yes I never beard anything against his character—I have seen him working with a barrow selling fruit COURT Q How long have you known him A From a child his age is about nineteen—I examined several broken pieces of plaster of Paris which I found—there were no marks on them they were broken up too small—when Field said she had nothing to do with it she only came to see them make it she spoke as if she was frightened—I am sure the others could have heard it she spoke loud enough—she was three or four yards from them at the time Fisher was nearest to her—there was a good deal of bustle in the room EDWARD HEWLETT policeman I took Fisher and found four bad sixpences on the hearth unfinished and quite warm produced —also some plaster of Paris—the prisoners were then all gone to the station Kelly Q I wish to know why there was not a constable there one or two persons came into the room and were ordered out A A young man came in and as soon as sergeant Woodhouse saw him he ordered him out—he had not gone up to the fire he went and spoke to Field at the window DENNIS CLARK policeman M 108 I assisted in searching the room—I found two bad shillings under the table—it was after the prisoners bad gone to the station WILLIAM WEBSTER I am one of the inspectors of coin to Her Majesty s Mint This plaster of Paris mould bears the impression of the head of a half erown it has not been used—I have taken the half crown out of it—to make it usable it wants the corresponding part for the reverse and it also requires the channel to be added to it—this galvanic battery is used for electro-plating the coins covering them with a coat of silver—we do not have quite so much electro-plated coin now as we had some years ago it gives too bright an appearance—these shillings are all counterfeit and from the same mould which has been made from the good shilling found in Kelly s pocket—these sixpences are counterfeit and from the same mould—there are enough pieces of broken plaster here to form a mould for a shilling or half Crown—this is part of a half crown of Her present Majesty which was found under the bed—it is different from this half crown mould— a basket full of broken pieces of plaster of Paris was here produced which the witness examined —this piece is part of a mould looking at one but I cannot swear whether the other pieces are parts of a mould or not Minns received a good character KELLY— GUILTY Aged 19 Transported for Ten Years BROWN MINNS FISHER and FIELD— NOT GUILTY

there—I moved it from the jar to the drawer where I put money but never loose—it is not a till—there was 1l s-worth of silver wrapped up in the drawer—I threw it back on the counter to the prisoner—it

one there was something in the manner of the prisoner that induced me to say so—I put the half crown in the trier—the prisoner came to the trier and I took it from him—both our hands were on it and it was bad—Mr Brooks took it out in his hand and gave it to the policeman Cross-examined Q Do you mean that your hand and your husband s were on it at the same time in the trier A Yes Mr Brooks said he

of 1839 it is a good shilling and is the model from which the mould has been made—I can tell that from corresponding marks on this good shilling and some of the counterfeit shillings—this paper contains six 4d pieces and here is the mould that they were made in—I can say that certainly from peculiarities I find in it Price s Defence I met this young man that morning in Drury-lane he asked me

coin and some plaster of Paris for making moulds Prisoner George Q How could you see me come down stairs nobody can see the stairs till they get to the foot of them A I had abundant opportunity of seeing you you had a piece of a bedstead in your hand in an attitude to strike and I believe that was your intention—there were some pieces of wood sawn in the back parlour under the stairs Prisoner Emma Q What violence did you see me use A I saw you struggling with a constable and he pushed you on the bed JAMES BRANNAN Junior Policeman G 21 I accompanied my father the last witness and saw the

these fragments of moulds I have been able to pick out a fragment of one for halfcrowns and one for shillings—this good halfcrown and shilling are like the patterns for these two moulds—these coins are all bad George Smith s Defence I was not coming down stairs I had not been up stairs at all I was in the parlour sawing wood it is a very strange thing if the man who was behind saw me coming down stairs and the one in front did not I was out nearly all day on the Friday the staircase is not in sight till you get near to the back door another man swears that he found two halfcrowns they turn out to be florins and when he is found out he says it is a mistake I wish to call Thomas Kemp THOMAS KEMP examined by the prisoner George Q Can you see anybody coming down stairs in that house A Yes

t18570406-468  468 JAMES FOWLER SELINA PHILLIPS and SARAH USHER feloniously having in their possession moulds for making florins MESSRS ELLIS and POLAND conducted the Prosecution JAMES BRANNAN SEN I was an inspector of police up to a recent period On 27th March in consequence of information I went to a cottage in the rear of Went worth Street Whitechapel between 10 and 11 o clock in the forenoon—I was accompanied by several other officers—the street door was fastened I broke it open with a sledge hammer and saw the three prisoners in the room sitting near the fire—Fowler was in his shirt sleeves—the door opens into the room—the house consists of that one room only—Phillips picked off the hob of the grate a part of a plaster of Paris mould she dropped half of it on the floor and Fowler attempted to stamp on it—he was immediately seized by Briant and myself—he offered a desperate resistance and kicked us most violently—we succeeded in throwing him on a bed in the room with the assistance of Evans who had Phillips in custody—I took from her hand a piece of plaster of Paris mould which I produce—both the females were then secured and I commenced searching the place—I found on the floor the obverse side of a plaster of Paris mould for making florins—on a dresser in one corner of the room I found this galvanic battery in full action with a counterfeit shilling in the bend of

for making and coating counterfeit coin and several bottles with acid in them Fowler Q How many times did you knock at the door before it was opened A Only once—I did not think it would answer my purpose to knock three or four times Usher I had only been in the room five minutes Witness I do not know—if she had only gone one minute before I should not have seen her COURT Q Had you seen either of those three persons in the room before A No BENJAMIN BRIANT Police inspector On Friday morning 27th March I accompanied the last witness to the cottage—I saw the door broken—it opens into the room—I followed the last witness in—I immediately seized Fowler who was rising from a chair—he fastened on me by my hair and kicked me violently—we had a struggle for several minutes—the last witness assisted me and we succeeded in pushing Fowler on the bed and after some time in handcuffing him—I then found these four counterfeit shillings produced on the floor by the bed side—they are finished—I then searched Fowler and in his trowsers pocket I found a good shilling which has been used in solution for coating—while I was struggling with Fowler I saw Usher stamping on part of a mould which had been dropped by Phillips—Usher kicked it under the table—it was then out of her reach—she tried to escape out of the room and was stopped by sergeant Brannan—I went afterwards with Fowler and Phillips and sergeant Brannan in a cab to the police court—as we were going Phillips said We are not married sir we have only been a few days together he told me if any of you came to be sure and break the moulds how do you think I shall get on —I said I don t know —Fowler was sitting there—he heard it but said nothing—Usher was in another cab with Mr Brannan Usher I may have kicked the mould with my feet but I never saw it Witness I am quite certain she saw it—she stamped on it wilfully THOMAS EVANS Policeman G 145 I was with the other officers—I saw Phillips go to the hob and take a plaster of Paris mould off part of which she dropped—I then laid hold of her and tried to take from her hand the portion which she had not dropped—Phillips said You shan t get it and tried to pull me away from her and scuffled with me—I pushed Usher away and inspector Brannan came and took the remaining part of the mould from Phillips s hand and in the scuffle several pieces dropped on the floor—I found these ten counterfeit shillings on the mantel piece of the date 1816—I went with Brannan to the police court Phillips I should not have been so wild if he had not pulled my hair and he struck me with something in his hand Witness I saw her hair fall all about but I did not see any one pull it—I did not strike her—I had nothing in my hand nor had any one except Mr Brannan who had the hammer in his hand which the door was broken open with JAMES BRANNAN Police sergeant G 21 I went with the other officers to the cottage I saw the door broken open—I went in I saw Usher attempting to escape at the door—I took her into custody—after securing her I saw on the mantel—piece five counterfeit shillings of 1816 wrapped in a piece of newspaper—I went to the police station with Fowler and Phillips—I heard Phillips say what has been stated by inspector Briant—Fowler was there I did not hear him say anything—he was paying attention and nodding Usher He pulled me in by the hair of my head Witness I pulled her in but not by her hair—she resisted very violently so did the whole three of them JAMES BRYAN Policeman G 104 I went with the other officers—I assisted Mr Brannan who was in a very violent struggle with Fowler I received a very violent kick—I found four counterfeit shillings of 1816 in a cup with water and sand—I afterwards went to the police court HENRY JAMES ADAMS I am landlord of the house On 27th March I arrived and found the officers in the place—I let the place to Fowler and Phillips together about three months ago—I received rent from Fowler up to the time the prisoners were taken—I have received rent of Phillips—I had seen Fowler and Phillips at the place daily as I was building a house within ten doors of it—I had been building about a month before 27th March—I had not seen Usher there WILLIAM WEBSTER I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint This mould has on it the obverse side of a florin it is made of plaster of Paris—the moulds are formed on a piece of glass like this or sometimes on tin—this plaster of Paris is in powder it is put in the mould and hardened with water—the impression on the mould is by putting a coin on the glass and the plaster runs all over it and then the mould is half done—here is a fragment of a mould with enough to enable me to see that it is the reverse side of a florin—here are Britannia metal spoons and metal used in making the coin—this spoon has been put in as they wanted it and so much would be melted away—here are twenty or thirty counterfeit shillings of the reign of George the Third 1816 some of them are quite complete and ready for circulation—here is no mould for making shillings nor any part of one—here is a good sixpence which has been used in the acid—this is the acid—here is the jar and the battery—here is a good sixpence attached to one wire and in these other wires are the shillings—they are all put into the acid and the acid takes the silver off the good sixpence at the bottom and throws it on the bad shillings—they then undergo another process which is scouring with sand to take off the taste which they have from the acid—after that they are coloured to make them look well when thrown down like shillings that have been some time in circulation—almost anything will do that sometimes they use a little black or a little dust—here is a good shilling which has been in the solution—here is everything necessary for carrying on the business of coining—here is some stuff used for cleaning the coin—these files have white metal in their teeth after getting the gets off these are used to file the coins—this battery is on a large scale—it would hold half crowns as well as shillings—a good shilling would coat very likely a thousand—it would go a great way Fowler s Defence I have known Phillips for some time and we were to have been married on the 6th I deny the charge of coining the house was certainly occupied by me and I gave a man my consent that these articles should be there on condition of his acknowledging a debt due to me of 26s but I took no part in making these coins I allowed my house to be used for such purposes without the knowledge of the crime and without the knowledge of Phillips I have stated this not to exonerate myself I am aware that I must suffer but I wish to prove to you the innocence of this female I had allowed the man to have the use of my place for six weeks and four of them had expired I had contrived to keep Phillips ignorant of it by sending her on visits or errands when anything was going on but on the Sunday previous I accidentally said to her If anything happens put those away which shall be at the fire she said What I told her to keep everything out of sight and to say that she knew nothing of what was going on Usher has known me the last three or four years and knew that I obtained an honest livelihood she had no thought that anything wrong was going on she came in that day without fear little thinking that within half an hour she would be in custody is it likely that a man should leave the door of a house when he was carrying on such a dangerous trade on the jar or on only the common fastening of a lock which would open with a kick had I been in the habit of obtaining my living by such means I should have fastened it but though I was in the house and knew what was going on I was not aware that I was so awfully breaking the laws Usher came in without suspicion and when she saw five men rush in in the manner that they did and use such violence she became alarmed Phillips knew nothing but was kept in ignorance she was with a man whom she thought was to be her lawful husband in less than a fortnight Usher s Defence I have known Phillips about six months I went to ask her to come round to my place I was not there five minutes before the officers came I am as innocent as you are FOWLER— GUILTY Aged 39 — Transported for Life PHILLIPS— GUILTY Aged 22 —Recommended to mercy by the Jury —

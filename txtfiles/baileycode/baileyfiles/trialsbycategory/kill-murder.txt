I jumped out of bed and ran down stairs and in the passage I saw Hussey and his wife striking my brother - the prisoner on seeing me up with his fist and knocked me down Gannon who was there brought my brother up stairs in less than two minutes into the front garret - I followed him up and on getting him into the room bolted the door - my brother was sitting on the bed undressing when I went in I told him to take off his clothes and go to bed and we would leave the house as soon as the night was over About ten minutes after I got into the room Hussey gave a blow with a hammer at the door which opened and he struck my brother with it on the left side of his head over his eye and knocked him down he was on the bed nearest to the door Q After he entered the room did anything happen before he struck him - A No my brother said nothing to him nor did anything he only kneeled down and was bleeding The prisoner then came and made a third blow at me - I grasped at the hammer to prevent the blow we were struggling in the room for ten minutes and then both got into the passage struggling for the hammer The watchman was on the landing place Hussey pushed me and knocked me down put his knee on my chest and kicked me - he then let go of the hammer When I saw my brother bleeding I was senseless and do not know whether I gave Hussey in charge or not I took the hammer into the street and whether I gave it to the watchman or not I do not know Hussey gave charge of me -

if there was any blood on him it was mine Q I ask you one question and tell you I have a witness to call - have you ever said I do not know that Hussey did strike my brother first but I will swear it for I think it no harm to be revenged on him - A No nor anything like it to any person I know Conway but said nothing of the kind to him Q Have you ever said that if Hussey s friends would give you 10 l you would go home or to harvest till this trial was over - A No I never said so to Green nor that as they would do nothing I would do all I could against him and give Green 2 l to swear against him I never spoke to him JOHN GANNON I am a labourer 1 June 1823 I lodged at the prisoner s house and slept in the back garret - there are two beds in the room I and Grogan slept in one and two men in the other This happened on a Saturday night I went to bed between eleven and twelve o clock all were in good humour then drinking in the kitchen - Michael Delaney was one of the party I left him down stairs when I went to bed I locked my room door and was disturbed between three and four o clock by Turvey who called me up it was day-light I went down and on the landing found the prisoner the deceased his brother the prisoner s wife and two or three others who I do not recollect they were pulling and mawling one another about Mrs Hussey sang out to me to take Michael Delaney up stairs to prevent the quarrel I laid hold of him and got him and his brother out of the mob with a great deal of trouble up to the first turn of the stairs Thomas Delaney broke down under my arm and went down - he wanted to go down again I took Michael up to his room but could not get in there so I took him up to his brother s bed-room and locked the door One Galaghan who slept in the room was there also M Grath - they were not in bed I asked Michael to go to bed he was very much intoxicated and wanted to go down again and said he would not go to sleep till he could be revenged on Hussey Q Mind what you say remember you have given an account of this before which is in writing - A I will mind his brother came up I knew is voice and let him in he locked the door Catherine the servant came up after that and told us all to go bed for the watchman had entered the house and if we did not he would take us into custody I went to bed then without opening the door to her Tom Delaney stood at the head of the bed in his small clothes and shirt I heard the door broken open in five or six minutes and when I turned round I saw that the deceased was on the floor bleeding and Hussey in the room he and Tom Delaney had both hold of each other the watchman was in the passage and both gave charge of each other I saw nothing in Hussey s hand I did not see him enter the room the first thing I saw when I turned round in bed was the deceased on the floor I suppose he was knocked down but I did not see him knocked down the watchman took Tom Delaney into custody the prisoner came back into the room and I saw him kick the deceased either on his legs or thigh while he was on the floor I got out of bed and then the watchman came in and took Hussey away Q Did Hussey say any thing when he kicked the deceased - A He said there never was a man reared from his father that he would not serve in the same way M Grath who is now in the hospital took the deceased into Mrs Turvey s room she attended to him he was in a very bad state indeed and said he should never get over it the room was stained with blood I observed a cut on his temple - I left the house directly Cross-examined by Mr PHILLIPS Q At what time did you first set down to drink that night - A Between ten and eleven I think - the two Delaneys and a few more of the lodgers were with us I went to bed in about an hour I suppose they continued there four hours after When I came down Mrs Hussey begged of me to take the deceased up stairs that there might be no more quarrelling he was very violent and so were every one of them they were all in a great passion Tom Delaney was as much inclined to fight as any of them but he came up of his own accord afterward I don t think one of them was sober The deceased passion did not cool at all when he got up stairs and Hussey s passion seemed to continue I saw an iron curtain rod in the room I saw it in the deceased hand he was doing nothing with it I was sober when I first went down - Hussey was bleeding in the mouth Tom Delany was down before me the watchman came up with Hussey I heard the door burst open I could see the door from my bed but my face was to the wall Q What time passed between your hearing the door burst open and seeing Hussey in the room - A Not three minutes and I saw the watchman directly I turned round in bed my bed was near to where he fell COURT Q Had the deceased the iron rod in his hand when the prisoner came into the room - A I cannot say my Lord ALEXANDER M CROMBIE I am a watchman I was on duty on Saturday night in June in New-street my attention was called to the prisoner s house by a woman who lives there I went and saw three or four men one on the top of the other on the passage floor I endeavoured to separate them as well as I could the landlord Hussey gave charge of one man whom I took to the watch-house Hussey accompanied me there we returned to the house the constable of the night and one or two watchmen came to my assistance Hussey then came out of a little room with a hammer in his hand and went up stairs - we followed him up and the first room he came to he burst open with the hammer he looked in and said nothing but wentup to a room on the second floor and burst that open looked in came out and went up to the third floor burst the door open with the hammer and went in but did not stop any time and I did not go in I said Do not break the doors open you should not do that he said the house is mine and I can do as I please with it this was while he was breaking the second door he came out and the deceased s brother and him were struggling and fell down on the landing-place we separated them and took both down Q At this time did you know anything of what had happened in the room - A No we took them to the watch-house and were going to take them to the compter they wanted some clothes I returned to the house went up to the same room and found a quantity of blood Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You and the other watchmen followed him up - A Yes close behind he knew we were following him I did not observe his mouth and face JOHN ELLIOT I was an officer on duty on this night and took the hammer from Thomas Delaney between the house and the watch-house MR R A STAFFORD I was house surgeon of St Bartholomew s Hospital I saw the deceased there on Sunday the 15th of June 1823 about five o clock in the morning when he was brought in I found his scull fractured on the left side - it was about an inch long and one deep - he was sensible he died on Tuesday morning His death was occasioned by inflammation of the brain caused by the fracture that could be produced by this hammer I think from the external appearance of the wound that the sharp edge of the hammer had done it Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Might not the wound be occasioned by falling against the foot of a bedstead - A I think not I do not think that the force of falling would do it the inflammation would certainly be increased by intoxication Prisoner s Defence The deceased and I were on good terms I did not intend to do him any harm I bore him no malice at all GUILTY Aged 29 Of manslaughter only Transported for Fourteen Years

I did not hear her say a word - she had her hand in her pocket to give some money to my child to get the victuals from the bakehouse and he knocked her down with his fist and kicked her with his legs several times while she was down - he kicked her in several parts about her body side and thighs persons began to collect and as soon as she recovered herself she got up and ran into a chandler s shop at the corner of the court he dragged her out by the hair of her head and her handkerchief knocked her down again and jumped upon her twice - the mob collected and I saw no more - whether he dragged her down the court or what I cannot say I stood at the top of the court and said Pray Con don t you he said If you don t get away I will serve you the same the woman had not spoken to him in my presence Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q When did you see him first on that day A About four o clock - they were both together and seemed very agreeable neither of them were sober but they were not far gone - he was more sober than her Q Do you recollect his complaining of her not getting the supper A No she was giving my girl the money to pay the baker when he came up I did not hear him speak to her nor she to him Q Did she not say to him You may kiss my head A Oh dear No He kicked her the first time he knocked her down I was perfectly sober and she seemed quite sensible CHARLOTTE DAVIS I live in Turnmill-street with my mother I saw nothing of this till Earl ran into the chandler s-shop The prisoner ran in and pulled her out by the collar and hit her on the back of the head with his foot - she did not fall he then pulled her to the top of the alley where they live took her by the hair of her head and threw her down the steps where they live - the alley goes down six steps - he forcibly threw her down them I did not go farther and saw nothing more Cross-examined Q How long had you know the deceased A From a child I have known the prisoner about a year she seemed solid when she ran into the shop - she did not appear at all drunk - she did not slip down the steps he dragged her down by her hair - he did not fall himself I had not been drinking with them SUSAN WELCH My husband is a chimney-sweeper I was in White Hart-court and saw Sullivan run into the chandler s-shop after his wife - he kicked her in the shop and pulled her out by her hair drew her down the steps by her hair then pulled her all along the court and dashed her in-doors like a dog into the room where they live I did not see him strike her till he got her in he then fastened the door and broke the chair all to pieces over her - he was beating her with the chair till he broke it he struck her eight or nine times with the chair - it was not a heavy one - every body was afraid to go near him she was laying down all this time and all her senses were gone Q How did you see all this A I followed him and said Con govern your passion he said I will serve you the same I peeped through the key-hole of the room-door and saw him beating her with the chair - the room door opens into the court While I was looking through the key-hole I saw him tie a handkerchief round her throat - he tried to choak her as it appeared to me he said at Hatton garden that when he got out he would cut me with a knife Cross-examined Q Do you know Mrs Meltis A Yes I had been selling cucumbers that night and was quite sober he kicked her when she was going into the shop the house is in a broad paved court he said the first person he caught near him he would murder - he would not let any body go in COURT Q Where did he strike her with the chair A About her back and sides - his face was turned towards the door - he had a waistcoat with sleeves on I did not see the chair fall on her head at all STEPHEN HEARN I keep this chandler s-shop About half-past eight o clock in the evening I was serving two customers - the deceased came forcing into my shop apparently terrified and before I got a sight of her the prisoner fetched her back by force but I could not see how and in about half a minute I heard a scuffling under my window I went out and saw the deceased laying on the pavement - the prisoner stamping his feet on her rather than kicking her - I saw that repeated several times her head lay towards my window and her feet towards the curb stone he took her up in his arms and I saw no more - my shop is next door to the court where they live she appeared to have no senses left when he took her up - he stamped on her about the middle of her body but not all on one place ROBERT SMITH I am a smith and live in White Horse-court - the prisoner lives in the first house in the court I was coming out of my room and heard a person telling the prisoner not to go and ill use his wife any more I saw him open his door and give his wife two kicks in her side and say Lay there you b - y w - e I was just at thedoor - I saw nobody else there - the door was shut he came and opened it and went in alone - I went away I think the kicks were in the body - it was near nine o clock - no mob was assembled then JOHN COOPER I am a surgeon and live in Cow-cross-street I was called in to see the deceased on Wednesday the 3d of August twenty-four hours after the injury - I found her laying in a most wretched state perfectly insensible when I felt her extremities she did not appear to feel at all I proceeded to bleed her arm but without success I afterwards opened an artery and got about three ounces of blood - I took her some medicine and with difficulty got two spoonsfull down I had a blister applied all over her head and mustard poulticies to her feet her disease being an oppression of the brain I was convinced she could not live - she was perfectly sensible all the time and on Thursday she died I opened her and found several bruises under the scalp very well marked indeed particularly on the left side of the head - the bruises were inflicted by blows of considerable violence they were very black and very extensive A person being dragged along the pavement would not produce them but a fall would I found four ounces of extravasated blood on the left hemisphere of the brain I ascribe her death to the extravasation which was caused by the violence on the head - that certainly produced her death her chest and abdomen were perfectly healthy there were several bruises on her body and legs but not sufficient to cause death Cross-examined Q Might not the extravasation proceed from other causes A The bruises could not I have in some cases of apoplexy seen extravasated blood but not so great a quantity - but here there was no cause for apoplexy there was no fracture the bruises without the extravasation would not produce death I saw the prisoner - he paid me 2 s 6 d for attending her and said he would pay me any charge when he received his money I said she would not survive he said he was very sorry and exhibited extreme anxiety It is not improbable that the edge of stone steps would produce such appearances except that there was no cut GUILTY Aged 33 Of manslaughter only -

I observed Dennis McCarthy coming with a stick in his hand and said to Sullivan Dan Dan look out there is something coming I had hardly spoken these words before Dennis McCarthy struck me with the stick on the head I had had no quarrelling with him at all lately Florance Mc-Carthy then came after me and struck me with a poker - I put my arm up - I was insensible - the blood spirted out of my arm - I got the sleeve of my coat torn with the point of the poker I also received a blow with a fist in my right eye and that brought me to the ground I lay there some time and cannot say what happened then to Sullivan when I recovered my son stood there calling out My father is murdered The prisoners were at the public-house that evening and went before us my son took me home -

I went to Rearden s house where the deceased lay I afterwards went to Florance Bryant s house - the door was bolted I knocked two or three times and at last after threatening to break it open somebody opened it I went in - the first thing I saw was Florance Bryant going up stairs on seeing me I and the watchman followed him up the door of the bed-room was fastened - I threatened to break it open and a voice within said they would come down as soon as they were dressed I came down leaving the watchman at the room door and heard a voice outside exclaim The e is somebody getting out of the window I went out - Florance McCarthy dropped from the window I secured him - he then had a clean shirt and trousers on Dennis McCarthy was secured in the house he was also in clean linen The ditch is very dirty and had a great deal of water in it at that time Mrs Burke gave me a poker on Wednesday the 15th of March HANNAH BURKE On the morning of the 12th of March I found this poker about break of day on the footpath - I pointed the spot out to Townsend SAMUEL TOWNSEND I am one of the parish officers The spot Burke pointed out to me is a few yards from the ditch which Sullivan s widow shewed me - it is about 150 yards from Bryant s THOMAS ANSELL I am a surgeon On the 11th of March at midnight I was called to the deceased - I found him laying on a bed at Rearden s house much exhausted but sensible I found several wounds on his head - one on the back of his head one on the forehead and another near the eye I attended him till death and afterwards examined his body the whole of his back was one livid bruise - I opened the body - the small intestines were in a state of great inflammation it appeared to me to have been occasioned by repeated blows the inflammation of the intestines was the cause of his death - it became gangrene he was quite a healthy subject except a very old complaint in the liver from which he had recovered - that had nothing to do with his death Cross-examined Q Did you discover any disease A None whatever there was inflammation about the kidneys Florance McCarthy in his Defence entered into an account of a quarrel between Rearden and one Collyer a few weeks previous to this transaction and stated that on the 11th of March Collyer and Rearden quarrelled again at the public-house about a pint of beer when the deceased was going to strike him with the pot but was prevented - that they went home and about 12 o clock Rearden and his party came to the door and called Collyer out to fight - when Bryant asked why he made a disturbance at his house at that late hour - they got fighting and the deceased attacked Bryant s wife and tore her clothes she called out Murder and they went to her assistance but used no violence to him they went in doors and in a few minutes heard a noise and went out hearing the men were fighting in the ditch and saw Florance Bryant and a woman helping him out of the ditch DENNIS McCARTHY s Defence The first of this was Jack Barry and Con Rearden had been to Lambeth-street about an assault Collins was a witness and Rearden said he would serve him out for it He came to our lodgings once or twice stripped called us out to fight and said he would have blood or something - and on the night this accident happened the deceased and Reardens were drinking at the Rose and Crown Collins drank out of their pot and they wanted him to pay for a pot - he refused and the deceased put up a pot and said he would strike him with it About twelve o clock they came to our house and called him all manner of names the landlady came out and was attacked we went out - Rearden told me to go home to his lodgings with him - I did so and as I returned I saw Sullivan near the ditch - he struck me and I struck him we both rolled into the ditch and I do not know what happened I was all covered with mud and stuff MARGARET DRISCOL I was in bed on this night and heard a row at a quarter or half-past twelve o clock the watchman said Rearden and Florance Bryant s people were fighting and he would have no hand in it and in about two minutes I saw Sullivan pass by going home - I moved towards the ditch where there were two or three women I saw Sullivan turn back with his wife - he pulled a rail out near the ditch went and struck Mrs Bryant with it three times - she called Murder and somebody ran down to Florance Bryant s - Dennis McCarthy and another man ran down from their place - I made the best of my way home when I saw the people coming FLORANCE McCARTHY - GUILTY DENNIS McCARTHY - GUILTY Of Manslaughter only - Transported for Life

heasked where I was going - I said seeking my husband he said Oh I have got a shilling or a sixpence he wanted to get me into some lonesome place he asked me to go I refused - I saw him again as God would have it- I happened to meet him again about two o clock he knew me again and spoke to me I thought if I could see a watchman he would see me home - I saw a watchman and spoke to him to take care of me the prisoner did not hear what I said - the watchman then went with me towards home The prisoner immediately flung a great stone at the watchman - there was nobody else to heave it but him there had been no conversation between him and the watchman I spoke to the watchman just by Baker s-row - the prisoner did not hear what I said as I whispered he was standing at a short distance I walked by the side of the watchman to near Whitechapel workhouse about ten yards - the prisoner was behind about three yards from me - another man was walking just before us we continued walking on with the watchman behind till we came to the workhouse the watchman did not speak to the prisoner he only said Let the poor woman go home the prisoner never said a word but directly flung a stone - I did not see it thrown - he could hear the watchman say let the woman go home the stone then immediately came at the watchman and knocked him right down I did not see the prisoner throw it as my back was towards him I heard it rattle turned round and saw the watchman on the ground we were almost side by side but he was rather behind me Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Was it not a very short time from the time the watchman came up till he fell A It might be ten minutes it began and ended in ten minutes I never saw the prisoner before - he was as sober as a Judge it was about two o clock and a very fine night COURT Q Was it moonlight A Yes my Lord and there are gaslights in the street I happened to be out - I was looking after a person I wished to see Q Did you hear the prisoner say any thing before he threw the stone A He never said a word and the watchman never said a word he never spoke afterwards - the stone was flung directly he said Let her go home - there was a gentleman before me who picked up the stone I could see him he could not have thrown the stone without my seeing him as he was walking before me there was nobody else in the street on that side of the way The prisoner ran away directly the stone was flung - he ran down the road behind us I was quite sober - I had not tasted a glass of liquor that evening Q Had you complained of him to the watchman A I only asked him to see me home JAMES HENRY DOLEMAN I am a silk-weaver On the morning of the 24th of July about two o clock or rather after I was in Whitechapel-road - I saw the prisoner and the deceased there and Mrs Gray was walking towards Whitechapel I was coming from Mile-end and was about six yards before them - Gray was walking rather first the deceased next and the prisoner behind - they arrived nearly at the end of the workhouse and then all three stopped I stopped standing before them the deceased said to the woman You had better follow that man meaning me and then you will be safe - the woman then said to the prisoner You go about your business the prisoner answered He shall not follow you meaning that the watchman should not follow her he had both his hands behind him - he took his left hand from behind him and immediately threw a stone at the watchman - I saw the stone and saw him throw it at the watchman who was about two yards or two yards and a half from him - it struck him rather above the left ear towards the temple he directly fell forward on his face and the prisoner ran away directly - he appeared quite sober I directly ran after him hallooing Stop thief a young man stopped him at the end of the road and delivered him up to me - I never lost sight of him I and the other young man delivered him up to the watchman directly I afterwards assisted in conveying the deceased to the Hospital he was in a very bad state bleeding at the left ear very fast I never heard him speak after he was knocked down Cross-examined Q Was it a bright moonlight night A It was after two o clock - day was beginning to break and it was very light from the gaslights - I could see him by the lamps I did not notice whether there was any moon it was nearly half-past two o clock the woman was nearer to the watchman than me and he spoke to her - I had no conversation with the prisoner but he appeared quite sober I do not know whether he and the watchman were at all acquainted it did not last above five or six minutes altogether COURT Q Did you hear the watchman say anything to the prisoner A Not at all I saw his hands behind him - he did not stoop he could not stoop to pick up the stone at that time without my seeing him he could not have taken it up while I was there or I must have seen him he was rather behind the deceased ROBERT STRATTON I am a hackney-coachman and was in Whitechapel-road on the morning of the 24th of July a little after two o clock at the corner of St Mary s-street against the post it joins the workhouse I saw the prisoner walking up the road with the deceased and the woman Doleman was before them - they walked within seventeen or eighteen yards of me by the workhouse - I I heard nobody speak I saw the prisoner throw the stone with his left hand the watchman immediately fell the prisoner turned round after throwing the stone and ran away I pursued him - a person stopped him before I got up to him but I never lost sight of him When I got up he asked if I could swear he was the man who threw the stone - I said I could he said nothing further I assisted in conveying him to the watch-house and the deceased to the hospital Doleman got up to him before me - it was getting towards light - the day was breaking The prisoner seemed perfectly sober Cross-examined Q Had you much opportunity of seeing whether he was sober or not A Yes I saw him in the watch-house I did not notice him before - it might last four or five minutes altogether MOSES MOSES I am a dealer in fruit and was in Whitechapel-road on the morning of the 24th of July between two and three o clock I heard a cry of Stop him Stop him I went towards the road to see if I could see any one running and saw a man running from the workhouse across the road in a direction for the New-road - I instantly ran across the road and secured him he resistedvery much and said Let me go - it was not me - it was not me that was all he said - it was the prisoner I went afterwards with him to the the watch-house and saw the deceased Cross-examined Q How far was the last witness from him A I saw nobody near him till somebody came to my assistance I just looked round me I did not look to see if any one was near - my attention was to secure the prisoner - I delivered him to Doleman COURT Q Did you see anybody beside the prisoner in the street A Not running When I laid hold of him I saw nobody near him Doleman came up in two minutes or a minute and a half there was nothing to obstruct my view down the street Baker s-row is not far from the workhouse - I could see very plainly from that distance he was stopped at the corner of the New-road opposite to Baker s-row about fifty yards from the workhouse JOSEPH SYKES I am a watchman of Whitechapel - On the morning of the 24th of July I was standing at the end of Great Garden-street in Whitechapel-road and heard a call of Stop thief I ran up to where the deceased lay - I was then desired to follow the prisoner which I did to the corner of Cannon-street-road when I got there he was custody - two or three men had hold of him we brought him back by where the deceased lay and a man sung out Look out for the stone as I came by my foot kicked the stone - I picked it up within about two yards of where the deceased lay and put it into my pocket I delivered it to the officer afterwards - I looked at it at the watch-house - I saw no blood nor dirt upon it but did not examine it close enough for that - it appeared to have been carried about for some time it had no dust nor any thing on it nor dirt or mud The streets were quite dry The prisoner did not appear the least in liquor The deceased s name was Ephraim Darkin Cross-examined Q If there had been dirt or mud on the stone must you have seen it A I dare say I must there were candles on the watch-house table where it lay it was within a quarter of a yard of the candle when I came to examine it at the office I saw a small spot of blood but I did not examine it minutely before COURT Q Was there any heap of stones near there - A No we went out to look I picked it up on the pavement just at the edge there was blood on the flags THOMAS BROWN I am a patrol of Whitechapel and was at the watch-house on the morning of the 24th of July when the prisoner was brought in Sykes delivered the stone at the watch-house it has been in my possession ever since and is in the same state now as it was then - there is a spot of blood on it there was more on it but being handled has taken a little of it off Here the witness produced the stone which was a large flint about nine inches in circumference MR PHILLIPS to JOSEPH SYKES Q You say there was blood on the flags A Yes I had not put my hand down into the blood - I did not see it there till I returned from the watch-hosue the deceased was about five yards from the stone - they had turned him round it might be four or five yards from the blood which was nearer to his feet as they had turned him round - I examined but could find no loose stones near the place - the road is M Adamized JURY Q Is not Baker s-row paved with this sort of stons A I do not know ALFRED HAMILTON I am a pupil at the London Hospital On Tuesday morning the 24th of July the deceased was brought there - he was completely insensible his feet and legs were cold and his pulse fluttering - he was evidently dying when he came in he had one bruise on the forehead and one above the left ear there was a severe bruise on the forehead and a considerable swelling - he lived about three hours after his death I examined the head there was a fracture of the skull passing from about the left ear across the base of the skull to the right ear there was from a pint to a pint and a half of extravasated blood on the brain - the blow above the ear was the cause of his death Cross-examined Q There was a severe blow in front of the skull A Yes as if it had come in contact with some hard substance - as if he had fallen with cousiderable violence - that was only a bruise and would not affect his life - the skin was not broken COURT Q Can you form a judgment how the blow above the left ear had been occasioned A By something striking the head a large heavy stone like that produced would do it I should think his merely falling down would not produce such a fracture I am satisfied his death could not arise from the fall but from the violence applied to the head Prisoner s Defence I know nothing about the concern no more than a child unborn GEORGE WICKERBY I have known the prisoner about twenty years I keep the Crooked Billet public-house in Rosemary-lane - he called there at half-past eleven o clock on the evening of the 23d of July there was a club-meeting there - he did not stay five minutes he appeared to be very drunk indeed MR QUIN Q How long have you kept this house A Since the 5th of May he was very drunk - he could not walk a man helped him down out of my house - I would not serve him with any liquor JOHN KELLY I was at the Crooked Billet on the 23d of July I saw the prisoner there between ten and eleven o clock he appeared a little elevated in liquor GUILTY Aged 27 Of Manslaughter only -

t18280703-26  Second Middlesex Jury - before Mr Justice Burrough 1374 JOHN CASEY TIMOTHY COCHRANE JAMES BARRY CORNELIUS BARRY JAMES SHEA JEREMIAH MURRAY JAMES HAYES DENNIS BURKE and TIMOTHY CONNOR were indicted for the wilful murder of John Eales alias Long John HENRY RUCKLEY I am groom to Mr Elmore of Duke-street Manchester-square On the 29th of June I was sent to Mr Reed s a farmer near Harrow I was there about half-past ten o clock at night and heard a great riot - I heard the voices of several persons abusing each other I ran to the spot and in the way met several persons coming back it was very dark - when I got to the spot the first thing I saw was the prisoner Casey striking Long John with a black-thorn stick across the shoulder the stick was rather thicker than my thumb - the blow knocked him down on the ground Casey instantly fell on his knees on him and beat him about the head very much with the stick the blood poured out of Long John s forehead very much - he gave him about three blows on the head when he was down - he tried very hard to get up but it was of no use he could not I went and pulled Casey off him - Long John then got up and was pulling his clothes off to fight Casey he said if assistance was given him to get his clothes off he would fight him they had a round or two and then the others came up Q Was the fight fair A No - Casey struck with a stick and John had nothing but his fist I cried out that it was not fair and then all these others came up - they fought for an hour or better before the others came up Q What before the others came up A They were so long between the rounds the stick continued in Casey s hands all the time but after about three blows were struck on John s head with the stick it was lost he cut him very much about the forehead with the stick and after that the fight was fair after fighting about an hour the others came up and Long John was struck by Casey across the loins with a hay-fork which the others had brought up one for him and the others for themselves some brought hayforks and some sticks they came from Mr Reed s barn which is about two hundred yards off Long John was standing on his legs when Casey struck him across the loins with the fork the blow knocked him down and he never moved hand or foot after that blow Q At that time none of the others had done anything A No I did not see whether one of them gave him the fork or whether he took it himself we were all obliged to run away then for they all ran after us with their forks - Casey followed with the rest Long John remained on the ground I and a person who was with me ran into my mother s house - we returned to the spot in about twenty minutes and found only the body there Bell and a woman stood looking at it Long John was not quite dead - he drew his last breath after we got there as we were carrying him to a house he did not speak but appeared to be alive the blood was running down his nose he made a noise with his nose we found some forks about which we have brought here The prisoners were all hay-makers at Mr Reed s I took the body to the Green Man public-house which is about ten yards from where it began - he was dead then Cross-examined by MR J ALLEY Q It was very dark A Yes but I could distinctly see every thing that was done I could see it was a black-thorn stick I believe they had been fighting before I came up the deceased was a stranger to me - I took no part in the fight I had an elm walking-stick in my hand - my feet were blistered as I had been driving a cart which I am not used to - I could scarcely walk on my toes Q Did you strike Casey A They ran at us and as I ran I struck him on the knuckles - that was all I did not see Casey knocked down by any one the witnesses Nix and Arnold were knocked down while Casey and John were fighting Barry and Hayes knocked them down- when I assisted to pull Casey off I put my stick back and struck him on the knuckles as I ran away to prevent the fork from coming into me none of us fought with them they could get the pitch-forks from the barn in two minutes before we could turn round they were on us again RICHARD ARNOLD I am a labourer and work for Mr Reed I was at the back door of the Green Man on the night in question Long John went out at the back door his woman was with him - a number of Irishmen came out after him one of them spoke to him out at the door - they seemed quarrelling but what it was about or what he said I cannot say Casey lifted up his fist and knocked Long John down without saying any more - Long John then called out for help to get the man off I went to him and saw these men beating him when he was down and I assisted him Casey was beating him - I cannot speak to the others he laid on the ground - Casey and some others were beating him I was in the scuffle about ten minutes and then had a fork run into my cheek and under my chin - I was then struck down with a blow on my head from a fork and was senseless Q How many persons were there A I cannot say - they were all fighting one among another but after that I saw nothing more Long John and the rest of the Englishmen were fighting with the Irishmen for their lives - this happened near the trees about twenty yards from the house Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q You work at Reed s A Yes - another Mr Reed is the prisoners employer When the row began there was not above five men but more came afterwards Casey spoke to the deceased before he struck him whether it was in anger or not I cannot say - I cannot swear that anybody but Casey struck him - he was a tall strong man we fought for our lives and struggled to get away as well as we could ELIZABETH REEVES I am a hay-maker and lived with Long John for eight years I was in the tap-room of the Green Man with him - the prisoners were up in the clubroom they did not seem to be in liquor - he was sober he went out about half-past ten o clock for a certain purpose - I went after him and just as I got to the door I saw Casey knock him down I heard no words between them- I got up to go out as soon as he got up and when I got to the door I saw Casey knock him down he got up and immediately struck Casey again - four men then came out to assist Casey he assisted himself as well as he could and when they got a little distance they all came up with forks Q Was there nobody to assist John A Only the two who got hurt all the rest ran away Casey s wife and Muiray were two of the four and one is not taken they would not let him get up any more Q A witness has said they fought for an hour before the forks came A No - there was a great skirmish but not for so long as that I was close to them - they tried to beat John but as he was very strong they could not till they got the forks these men then fell on him knocked him down with the forks and beat him as long as they could Casey and his wife then got on him and stamped on him he lived for half an hour after that Casey and the other two men struck him with forks - the fork struck him in the eye - I saw the whole of it there was no fighting for an hour nor any stopping between the bouts - Casey went away for half an hour returned with a scythe and fork and said to me Is he dead I said he was dead but he was not - Casey said If he is not dead I am come to kill him with a scythe and fork nobody but me was there then - he made towards the body but a man came from the other side of the hedge to assist me and so he went away without touching the body Q How long might it last altogether A I suppose an hour the skirmish with the fork and all before he was dead Cross-examined by MR J ALLEY Q You have cohabited with the deceased eight years A Yes - there were four of us in the public-house we had two pots of beer - we were there about an hour and a half I did not say at the office that I had been there five hours the deceased was quite sober - two others shared the beer with us there was no quarrelling in the house the prisoners were not in the tap-roop I went out directly after John to get him to go home he knocked Casey down after Casey had knocked him down - there were five of them down the deceased was very violent on this occasion - his right name was John Eales we had been down there about three weeks - we went to hay-making I saw John Nix strike a man with a stick but I kept by my own man the witnesses helped John all they could when they tried to get him down Q There was a general row and scuffle after the quarrel between the deceased and Casey A Yes - there were four on our side and I suppose fourteen on the other - some others were on the other side of the hedge but not with us I do not exactly know how many there were on our side MR BARRY to RICHARD ARNOLD Q You saw Casey strike the deceased near the public-house A Yes and he got on him as soon as he was down Rackley was not there till I was beat out of my senses - I did not see him I was wounded in the chin in less than ten minutes JAMES BELL I am carter to Mr Gray I was not at this fight but got up just after and was taking the deceased off the ground when Casey came up and asked who I was he said he would kill me - I said I hope not John he said Who are you he came and looked at me and said You are Gray s carter - is the man dead if he is not I will kill him quite this was about eleven o clock - I gave him good words and he went away I went with him a little way Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Were you alone A No the woman was with me I had seen no part of the transaction Cross-examined by MR J ALLEY Q Was he dead when Casey said he would kill him A Not quite Casey spoke in a violent manner WILLIAM GRIFFITHS I was in the Green Man publichouse about twenty minutes or half-past ten o clock I saw the deceased and Arnold go out of the house - they went across to where there were some lrishmen and women who appeared to be quarrelling there seemed an uproar - I could not hear what passed - I said there was a fight and ran over - the deceased was then stripped and fighting with Casey with his fist just as I got up they were both down the men there got them up again and almost immediately they were down again - they were stillfighting with their fists they continued to fight fair for five or ten minutes but when some more Irishmen came running up the road and threw stones over the hedge where I and several young men were standing - I said it was time to run away I ran to the house and asked the landlord to let me in Cross-examined by MR J ALLEY Q You heard an uproar before you saw them fighting A Yes the deceased was stripped and I think Casey was not stripped but I was so confused I did not notice I did not see the beginning and cannot say who struck first Casey would not let the man go when he was on the ground - they were pulled away by somebody both seemed irritated the deceased seemed to want to fight fair - Nix and Arnold were there I cannot say whether they interfered I saw nobody with sticks but I returned a second time from the public-house and then saw Lacey with a fork or scythe JOHN NIX I am a shoemaker I went to the Green Man the landlord would not draw me any beer I was returning to my lodging and on the green very near the Green Man I saw two men stripping as I thought to fight - I saw the deceased knocked down by Casey I cannot say what he did it with - it appeared to be with something not his fist I had a stick in my hand being a cripple - I immediately went up to the spot several men were there - I cannot say who I interfered with my stick I had not been long among them before I got a severe cut over the eye and two stabs underneath I saw no more pass - I was fighting in among them with my stick trying to rescue the deceased I fought till I fell into a ditch being blinded with the blood which flowed from one eye into the other Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Were you perfectly sober A Perfectly I saw Rattle with a stick I did not see them strip - I did not get up to them when it first began I did not see Bell till the deceased was picked up - his the deceased s coat and waistcoat were off COURT Q You could not see what passed after you were in the ditch A I got my eye bound up then armed myself and went to pick the deceased man up STEPHEN LACEY The first I saw of this was the Irishmen throwing stones at the Englishmen at the Green Man - we then followed them down the lane a few steps and met the Irish with their forks and things the deceased was stripped - I saw Casey take a fork and beat him down for dead with it they had been fighting before that - I received a blow on my head from some of them and went away I afterwards saw them bring the dead body away Cross-examined by MR J ALLEY Q Had you not seen them fighting before Casey knocked him down A No I did not fight - I kept them off from the poor man as well as I could with my hands I did not knock anybody down - I tried to do it I was there about a quarter of an hour there was not a general battle I saw the Irish with forks - I did not see the deceased s party strike the prisoners I saw the prisoners strike them repeatedly - they did not return the blows I never saw the deceased before I had lived there about three weeks and came from High Wycombe I never heard the deceased called the fighting man there were about six English and fourteen Irishmen- I did not see the whole of the fight JAMES BROOKS I am a labourer I saw Casey strike the deceased several times and saw him strike him with his fist when he was down I left them and did not see him get up I had not seen the quarrel JOHN ISHWIN I was at the public-house I went home and after that heard a noise and went out I saw the deceased and Casey fighting with their fists - they fought till they got through the hedge I stopped till the Irish came up the lane and then ran away - the deceased and Casey fought several rounds up and down with their fists I saw no stick in Casey s hands JOHN STREET After this fight I heard a great noise in the barn I saw Casey come down towards Mr Reed s after the man was killed - he was stripped and had a scythe in one hand and a stick in the other he said there was one man dead if not two and if any man attempted to take his weapons away he would destroy him - I saw nothing of the fight Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q Are not the scythes and things kept at his master s A Yes I suppose so JAMES TROWER I am a horse-patrol I met Casey in a lane on this night - he would not surrender I threatened him and he threatened to knock me off my horse and attempted to strike me - I followed him across two fields and found him in a ditch he was very obstreperous - he had a fustian jacket on and a stick in his hand WILLIAM PUTNAM I am a labourer I was going by the Green Man - Casey had got the deceased down and two more were scuffling about with him I cannot say who they were some others stood in the road - they ran down and said Let us go after a fork I saw them come back and then ran home JOHN COLLINS I was in Mr Reed s field and heard a row in the barn among the Irishmen - they were quarrelling and fighting among themselves I stopped there about ten minutes and then returned to the field - I came back saw the patrol and told him Casey was coming down DANIEL BOWEN I am a surgeon On the 30th of June at one o clock in the morning I saw the deceased lying on a board in a stable quite dead he had been very much beat about the face - the bruises were very considerable there were two incised wounds on the upper lip and one in the under lip - that appeared a contused wound the lower jaw was fractured - his month was full of blood and there were punctures with a fork in his left shoulder and considerable bruises about the chest on opening the scalp a great quantity of blood flowed out and on opening the skull ten or twelve ounces of blood flowed there was a considerable wound in the left eye about two inches long on the orbit ridge I consider the suffusion of blood on the brain must have been the cause of his death a blow on the loins might have brought on paralysis no doubt Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q It is your opinion that he died from the suffusion of blood on the brain A Yes he appeared to have been knocked about by very heavy weapons I think the wounds on the lip were caused by the prongs of a fork - I cannot say whether the blow in the eye was caused by a stick or a fall The prisoner Casey handed in the following statement - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - I and my fellow prisoners were employed by Mr Reed a farmer of Harrow at hay-making for some time back On the 14th of June last before this business happened the party of the deceased came up to the barn which Mr Reed allowed myself and my fellow prisoners to sleep in and threw stones and brick-bats into the barn and threatened to kill us On the night in question which was Sunday I was at the Green Man the deceased was there and struck me first - he gave me a violent blow and knocked me down he also knocked Burke down and beat him when down After the deceased struck me I returned the blow I then retired from the fight the deceased renewed the fight - he ran over to where I was and struck me a second time upon which I instantly seized a pitch-fork which laid in my way and which I had used the day before in hay-making and I struck Long John with it my fellow prisoners and myself were first struck by the deceased and his party and a general scuffle then followed I and my fellow prisoners were knocked down many times and much cut by pitch-forks which the deceased and his party struck us with I declare before God and my country I had no intention to kill any one I was almost cut to pieces by the deceased and his party ABBEY BROWN I live at Harrow and was at the Green Man between nine and ten o clock when the row began the deceased asked Dennis Burke for a drink of beer -

t18280911-16  1574 MARGARET HARTIGAN was indicted for the wilful murder of a certain female child named Maria Ann Moore SEVERAL OTHER COUNTS varying the manner of describing the child s name MESSRS ADOLPHUS and RYLAND conducted the prosecution CATHARINE CRAWLEY I am single I had a child living - it was a girl it would be six months old this month - its name was Mary Moore I do not know that it had been baptized - I called it Mary Moore My mother is dead I never saw the prisoner before her mother was about six weeks in the place where I lodged - she lodged in the lower room for a fortnight and then came to lodge in the same room with me at No 5 Crown-court White s-yard Rosemary-lane Whitechapel - a woman named Smith kept the room and lived there another woman lodged there Smith had two children and the other woman had two children also On Tuesday the 26th of August I saw the prisoner there I was out for about five minutes before this happened and when I came back I found her in the room - I had never seen her before there Toomey and the prisoner s mother were there - Mrs Smith was not there there was another woman named McCarthy but she went down as soon as the row began - there were three children in the room mine Toomey s and the prisoner s my child and the prisoner s lay on the bed - Toomey had hers in her arms there was a fire in the room and a kettle on it when I went in As soon as the row began the prisoner told her mother to take the kettle off the fire because it was boiling Q Do you mean to say the prisoner said Take the kettle off because it is boiling A Yes and the mother took it off in about two minutes and put it down on the hearth the prisoner s mother got hold of Toomey and asked her what business she had there she said she was in a gossip s place she had been there before and she would be there after Q Who did she mean by the gossip A Smith who keeps the room when she made that answer the prisoner went up and struck her over the side of the head with a stone bottle - Toomey said she was much obliged for the reception she had given her and she did not expect such a reception when she came up stairs - then the prisoner went over to Toomey and struck her in the face with her fist again up to this time Toomey s child was in her lap and mine on the bed - Toomey then put her child on my lap saying it was a pity to let a blow go twice she then got up took hold of the prisoner and knocked her down on the other bed - she fell on the bed without much violence she shoved her on it- the prisoner s mother and brother then came and began to beat Toomey I then got up saying it was a pity for two to be on one and began to part them as well as I could - the prisoner screamed Murder three times when Toomey beat her Q Then Toomey and the prisoner were fighting A Yes - she screamed Murder Mrs Anderson came up and began to separate the prisoner and her mother from Toomey and the brother they were separated and the mother went out of the room to look for an officer - I had put Toomey s child in bed along with my own and in the same bed with the prisoner s child they all three lay on one bed - when Anderson separated the prisoner she the prisoner came pulled my hair and tore my gown off I was not able to resist after that - I went over towards the window to put my hair up my cap and all was off - the prisoner then went over to the bed took her child off and laid it under the window I saw her put a child there - I cannot say whose it was she then made over to a kettle of boiling water which lay on the hearth and said if she could not get her revenge on the b-l-y women she would on the children she took the kettle in her hand and threw it in among the children in the bed she threw kettle and all on the bed - she then ran and took her own child from under the window the lid was on the kettle when she threw it but it came off and was found in the bed afterwards - she threw it up towards where the children were at the head of the bed there were two children then on the bed - her own was under the window Q Can you say whether the kettle fell on the children A No I heard it go against the wall with the force of the blow about three fingers length above the bed I ran to take my child off the bed and saw the kettle in the bed I dipped my child into a tub of cold water which stood opposite the bed - its clothes were entirely full of water - the heat of the water burnt my fingers as I took her up - it was all over water except its face and stomach which lay on the bed I screamed out that my child was killed a man ran up stairs and took it to the hospital - I was there till it died which was about one o clock next day - it had never had a day s sickness in its life and five minutes before it happened I saw it on the bed as well as ever it was Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You have never been married A No it was the only child I ever had - I cannot say what day of the month it was christened I never swore it to anybody - I never had occasion- I get my living by selling oysters and fruit I lived with a man named Moore but not at that time - he is the father - he is now at sea I am eighteen years old next St Patrick s day - Moore has been at sea five months and was at home when the child was born I have lived at this house ever since it was born and never saw the prisoner before that afternoon I cannot say what time it happened - I believe it was about two or three o clock in the day - the prisoner s mother and I had lived in the same room together for about three weeks the prisoner had never seen the child before to my knowledge - I did nothing to her but separated them Q On your oath did not you take away the mother in order that Toomey might beat her A I took her away that the prisoner and Toomey might fight it out together - they fought for about three minutes before they came up stairs - they fought for about ten minutes altogether Q How did it begin A Toomey and the prisoner had some words down in the court - they made it up and came up together they had not fought down stairs they only had a couple of words as I heard them say - they fought for about ten minutes altogether then the kettle was thrown - it had been off the fire ten minutes I saw the prisoner with one black eye when I saw her at Lambeth-street - she beat Toomey more than she beat her only she did not give her a black eye I never said she took the kettle off the fire or hob nor that she poured the water on the child I only just dipped my child into the cold water took it out again and screamed Murder the prisoner had called Murder three times - that was before Anderson came up Q She was beating Toomey almost all the time A Yes Toomey wasover her on the bed - she got the best of it the brother was about eight years old - he was beating Toomey in the face with his fist the mother was dragging her by the gown and tore it off her back Q Did she throw the kettle the very instant she was separated from Toomey A After she beat me Anderson shoved her away from me to part us I never offered to fight either of them - I only pushed the mother away I did not strike either of them I went to the hospital in five minutes leaving the prisoner and her mother in the house Q Was not the prisoner like a mad woman A No she was perfectly calm quite collected not at all agitated - I observed she was not at all alarmed at what she had done Q You took particular notice to see whether she was agitated A When I saw the people come about her I saw her putting up her hair as unconcerned as if she had not done it at all I did not join in the row - I sat on the bed she had invited Toomey up to have tea with her - I was on the bed when she and Toomey came up stairs I always called the child little Mary or little Mary Moore I am a Catholic Smith my landlady took it to the priest to be christened about three weeks or a fortnight after it was born CATHERINE TOOMEY I am single I know the prisoner and her mother On the 25th of August I had had some words with the prisoner she afterwards called me up stairs to her mother s lodging in Crown-court - I had my child with me I went up and the prisoner began to abuse me - we had not many words before she came over and struck me I was sitting down with my child in my arms - she struck me on the head with a stone bottle Crawleywas in the room and had a child in her arms - the prisoner had her child she laid it out of her arms before she struck me and put it on the bed she struck me once without the stone bottle then struck me with it her mother was in the room and came over and struck me then caught me by my hair and dragged me about - they were both on me at once I gave my child to Crawley to defend myself from them both Crawley seeing them both beating me threw the two children on the bed out of her arms and came to save me from them the prisoner s brother was in the room - he struck me too they were all on me when Crawley came to my assistance - Crawley came between them both as well as she could to save me - I was then standing I cried out Murder and Mrs Anderson ran up stairs - she put them all aside as well as she could disengaged me from her hands and separated us the prisoner then took her own child out of the bed and put it under the window about as far from the bed as I am from your Lordship she then went up to the fire a kettle of water stood on the hearth she said if she could not have revenge on the women she would on the children - she took the kettle off the hearth and threw it over the bed right over the two children she stood at the side of the bed near the wall she did not pour the water out but threw kettle and all - the kettle did not go near the children as I saw it stopped in the bed it did not hit them - the lid was on when she took it up Q From anything that passed had you an opportunity of knowing whether the water was cold or hot A It was on the fire when I came up I did not see anything done to it afterwards Q When it went out of the prisoner s hands where did it hit A I did not notice immediately it was thrown the children began to cry - Anderson called Murder the children are scalded to death - I took up mine Crawley took her child up and dipped it down - a man came up and took it to the hospital my child was also sealded but not so dangerously as the other - I took it to the hospital the doctor dressed it - I brought it home Crawley s child was called little Mary Moore Cross-examined Q Is that your child you have got in your arms A Yes I took it to the hospital two or three mornings and had leave to stay with it there - it was getting well I did not strike the prisoner till she struck me twice I know her mother but had never quarrelled with her - I live at No 11 Crown court Q What business had you at her house A I was going for some tea and sugar - I was not asked to tea I called Murder two or three times and that brought Mrs Anderson up the prisoner did not cry Murder she had a black eye which I believe I gave her - Craw ley did not fight she only came between us - I did not see her strike at all the fight might last about a quarter of an hour - the prisoner was in a very great passion nobody but her beat me there were three of them against me - I could not do much - I got into a passion when she struck me the children lay on the bed dressed not under the clothes - we had been talking at the foot of the stairs but not scolding I got into a passion when she struck me MR ADOLPHUS Q Though you were not asked to tea were you up stairs A The prisoner asked me to come up after the child was scalded she sat on the bed and seemed to take no notice of the children COURT Q You were talking at the foot of the stairs what words passed between you A I cannot tell the words - there was no quarrelling then the quarrel began up stairs by the prisoner saying she was a married woman and one thing or another I said if she were married she had no occasion to talk about it I do not know what was said afterwards I said if she were married that was enough - I had not said she was not married ANN ANDERSON I am married and live at No 5 Crown-court on the second floor On this day before I went up I heard a noise as if they were all fighting together I ran up stairs - it was between four and five o clock I first saw the prisoner s mother on the bed very much in liquor and Mrs Toomey was beating her - I tried to part them and did so as soon as I parted the prisoner s mother she ran down stairs - the prisoner and Crawley were in the room when the mother had gone down stairs the prisoner fell on Crawley and beat her - I parted them the prisoner went away - the three children were all on the second bed - I always knew Crawley s child by the name of Mary Moore the prisoner then went and took her own baby off the bed and put it under the window about two yards from the bedstead - she then said as she could not have revenge on the b-y women she would on the children she took the kettle up and threw the hot water over them - the lid jumped off and went under the bedstead the lid was on it when she took it up but was afterwards found under the bedstead separate from the kettle - the kettle was full of water which went over the children I called Murder - Miller came up and took Crawley s child to the hospital Cross-examined Q Toomey was beating the prisoner s mother when you came A Yes they were all fighting together - she was beating her severely the mother was a very stout woman and very much in liquor Toomey was over her - Crawley and the prisoner fought for about ten minutes Crawley did not strike at all - it was the prisoner beating her Crawley did not beat the mother it was Toomey - the prisoner called Murder - I suppose from the noise I heard they had been fighting for a quarter of an hour - the prisoner was not much beat the mother hallooed out that her daughter was being killed and went down to get an officer - her daughter was not being ill-used at that time they were all fighting together - the bed was about a yard from the fire COURT to CATHERINE CRAWLEY Q You said there were a couple of words between the prisoner and Toomey at the foot of the stairs A Yes - they had a few words - I cannot say what it was I heard them talking the prisoner s mother caught hold of Toomey directly she came up and asked what brought her there - Toomey said she was there before her and would be there after her in her gossip s place the prisoner said she was married - Toomey had called her a wh-e those were the first words - she said that before Toomey had said anything to her NATHANIEL MILLER I carried Crawley s child to the hospital it had been scalded - I delivered it to a gentleman there Perry was with me JOHN PERRY I went with Miller to the hospital Mr Wild the surgeon took charge of the child MR JAMES WILD I am a student at the London hospital On the 26th of August the child was delivered to me in the presence of Perry it had been scalded all over its belly its back the front and back of its bowels and legs it had lost a great portion of skin and appeared very much exhausted from the shock it had received it continued under my care till one o clock the next day and then expired I ascribe its death to the scalds Cross-examined Q Did you know it had been immersed in cold water A Yes they told me so immediately it was brought - that was calculated to do it good I had no hopes of it and told them it would not survive long by the shock I mean the hot water MR ADOLPHUS Q Is not cold water the best application to a burn A The sooner cold is applied the better THOMAS BANKS I am a headborough of Whitechapel I heard of this accident and went to look for the prisoner on Tuesday night but could not find her till Wednesday morning when I found her in a back room at Mr Gray s Rosemary-lane I have the kettle - I saw it found about half-past six o clock there was about half a pint of water in it- I told the prisoner what I took her for she said she was coming to give herself up to me - she knew she had done wrong and had been very uneasy all night I had made her neither threat nor promise Cross-examined Q What state was she in A She had no black eye to my knowledge JANE SMITH I knew Crawley s child and took it to be baptized at the Roman Catholic chapel Mr Foley was the priest who christened it and I stood godmother I gave it the name of Mary Ann Moore - I did not understand the language the ceremony was performed in THE REV RICHARD HORROBIN I am one of the ministers of the Roman Catholic chapel in Virginia-street the Rev Mr Foley is also minister of the chapel I produce a register of the baptism which is in Latin I know it to be in Mr Foley s hand-writing - the register is kept in the Sacristy the translation of it is Mary Ann Moore born the 12th of March 1828 baptized 20th of March by the Rev J Foley the godmother is Jane Smith Cross-examined Q This is entered as the daughter of Catherine Crawley and Thomas Moore A Yes there is an erasure - it has been the daughter of Thomas and Catherine Moore but finding it was illegitimate the alteration was made at the time Prisoner I have said all I have to say - I do not wish to say anything now GUILTY Aged 21 Of manslaughter only -

t18300415-225  London Jury - before Mr Justice Park 892 DANIEL GOULDING was indicted for the wilful murder of Sarah Goulding SARAH BROWN I live in Ireland-yard Blackfriars The prisoner and his wife lived in the second floor front room for about six months - they had two children I never saw him strike her - I have heard them quarrel she was always at home with him except he put her out of doors which I have known him do two or three times a week - he sometimes put her out all night at ten o clock sometimes at seven sometimes at twelve or one and she very often did not come in all night - he used to fasten the door and lock it to prevent her I have heard him at those times say he would be hanged for her - she was delivered of a still-born child six or seven days before she died there are two children alive now - she was only five or six months gone with the last it was a miscarriage - she was never out of bed after the child was born she was a very good quiet woman and he was very quiet when sober but when he got a drop he was the reverse - he was often in liquor he never put her out of doors except when in liquor - I am sure she was not in liquor at those times she did not drink Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q How long ago is it that he said he would be hanged for her A It might be two or three months - I am a good deal out myself one of their children is fifteen or sixteen years old and the other seven - they lived at home and are both boys Q In their quarrels have you not heard the deceased s voice very loud A She has hallooed out Murder and spoke angrily to him COURT Q How far is your room from theirs A Mine is on the ground floor I did not visit them ELLEN BERRY My husband is a carpenter I had known the deceased Sarah Goulding for about two years and a half - I did not live in this house I have seen her and the prisoner together sometimes they sometimes lived comfortably and sometimes quarrelled the prisoner was the most violent - I never saw him do any thing to her I laid her out after her death - I washed the body but did not observe any marks on it there were marks about her forehead but they were from a disorder - I understood it was the bad disease I did not examine the scull - I have heard the prisoner several times call her a b-y w-e and have seen her in a passion in her passion I have seen her pull her cap and tear it - I then got out of the room as soon as I could I did not see the prisoner do any thing ELIZA GOLDSMITH I live in the adjoining room to the prisoner I never saw him commit any violence on his wife they very frequently quarrelled - I heard her sometimes use aggravating words when she has been on the stairs after he has turned her out of the room which he frequently did as I live up stairs I cannot say whether he ever turned her out of the house - on the 2nd of April- between five and six o clock in the morning the prisoner knocked at my door and said his wife wanted to speak to me - I went to her she was ill and was delivered at five o clock that evening - she had a doctor from the dispensary she died on the 10th - I saw her almost every hour in the day-time I never saw the prisoner use her ill while she was in bed HANNAH BALL I live about twenty yards from this house I saw the deceased in the street on Thursday morning the 1st of April - I was at my own window and heard her crying I looked out and heard the prisoner at the same time speaking very rash to her - I did not see him but knew his voice he said You b-y w-e I will smash you but I did not see him do any thing - I never saw her again MATTHEW FOY I am patrol of Castle Baynard ward I have known the deceased and prisoner some time On Sunday morning the 7th of March about eleven o clock I heard a disturbance between them the prisoner was calling her every name he could think of - she said very little to him I was in the same house - I heard two distinct falls on the floor as if somebody had fallen down or been knocked down I heard words between him and his wife and just after I heard the falls she called out for Mrs Brown the landlady to come up to protect her from her husband s violence - I then heard him tell her he would be her b-y butcher and would be hung for her at the Old Bailey I have heard him use that expression frequently before - the last time before that was three or four weeks before they were so addicted to quarrelling and wrangling I took no notice of it Cross-examined Q Did he appear the worse for liquor that Sunday morning A No not much He had been drinking I did not go into the room WILLIAM PYE I have known the prisoner and his wife some years the deceased came to my house on the 1st of April holding her hands against her side and crying - she appeared much agitated she said nothing about her husband - she did not remain there above a moment I did not see the prisoner nor hear him that morning SARAH BROWN re-examined I remember being called up by the deceased on the Sunday morning Foy mentions the prisoner was on one side of the door and she stood on the landing - she said to me Pray come up and take my part for he is going to ill-use me I went up and told him I must not have that noise on Sunday and if he could not be at peace he really must go out - he made no answer I told her if she would come down with me he might get his temper over and she came down - he said he would serve me the same I do not know what he had done to her - there were no marks of bleeding or any thing then but there were after I was in her room when two doctors were there - I think that was the day before she died she said she could not live and appeared to believe she was in a dying state - the prisoner was in the next room near enough to hear what she said I am quite sure the doors between the rooms were open - they are very small rooms the bed-curtains were drawn aside when the doctors came in they asked how she was she said she had been ill-treated - that Mr Goulding had been ill-treating her and she certainly must die from it she said he had beat her and she could not get over it she was so bad - the prisoner said he had not done it he had not beat her at all - she said You have knocked me down like a bullock and if I die my death will lie on your hands he again said he had never touched her - she did not seem at all out of temper at this time but quiet Q Did you not tell the Coroner she seemed in a passion when she said this A Yes she was but she was not able to be in a very high passion she told me before this that she thought she should not recover Cross-examined Q She said he had knocked her down like a bullock - did you examine her corpse A I helped to wash and lay her out I saw no marks DANIEL FELSTEAD I lived in the same house as the prisoner in the second floor back room I had only known him and his wife a fortnight the first quarrel I heard was on the 1st of April - they were quarrelling up stairs and I heard a fall I heard him say Come out you bl-y w-e or I will be your b-y butcher - she came down stairs he followed her and my door opened with the pressure of her arm - I then saw him following her and saw him kick at her as if he kicked her*** with his feet it did not seem able to do her any harm - she did not fall I did not hear her speak Cross-examined Q Are you sure this was not earlier than you mentioned A No it was on the 1st of April he kicked at her I did not see Foy there JONATHAN PEREIRA I am a surgeon - I reside at the General Dispensary Aldersgate-street I was called in to attend the deceased she was an out patient - I was there on the 2nd of April she had miscarried about four hours when I saw her - I called the prisoner into the room to talk to him about the dangerous situation of his wife I had been informed that he beat her and asked him how he could think of beating a woman particularly in her situation he denied having beat her at all - I then applied to the women present whether they had not just before told me he had beat her they made no answer - the deceased after a few seconds said Goulding if I was on my death-bed you know you are the cause of my illness - you knocked me down like a bullock he made no direct reply to her but denied it to me - I was afraid from his appearance he might behave violent to her in my absence and told him she was in a very dangerous state and perhaps his life would depend upon her life that she must be kept quiet and if she died he would be hung for it he said he could not help it he did not beat her - since her death I have opened her body and also examined it externally I discovered no marks of recent injury on the outside - no blackness nor any thing of the kind on opening her on the left side of her body I found marks of inflammation on the membrane covering the lungs and a slight inflammation of the upper orifice of the stomach - these were not solely the cause of her death it was the combined effects of her miscarriage and the inflammation which produced more fever than is usual in miscarriages - there was more fever attending the inflammation and miscarriage than usual I cannot state what produced the miscarriage not from inspection - if I had examined the body without knowing what had been told me I should have thought it probable that the inflammation had been the cause but should not have known it to be so the inflammation might have proceeded from various causes - it must have been recent I should say within a fortnight and very probably later than that - if it had proceeded from external violence it would not necessarily produce any external appearance Q Are you able to say what in your judgment was the immediate cause of her death A Not any one of the symptoms I have mentioned but the combined effect of the mis-carriage and inflammation in a healthy person I should say not any one alone would have produced death I think if kicks or blows had been given to knock her down would produce inflammation - that might produce miscarriage - and the combined effect of the two in a weakly woman might have produced death Cross-examined Q Might not these appearances have presented themselves from natural causes A It is possible Q Had she not been afflicted with siphilis A She had marks of having excoriation of the bone of the head and some marks about the shoulder but that had been years before she was more liable to inflammation and must necessarily have been a bad subject therefore not able to bear the proper treatment for inflammation - it would probably have been better if I had been called in earlier after the miscarriage but the principal symptoms she laboured under were not miscarriage but inflammation I would not say she had been afflicted with siphilis AMELIA SUTTON I lodge in the room under the prisoner On the 1st April I heard a dreadful lumbering over my head and heard Mrs Goulding scream out Murder violently - I heard the same lumbering noise again and she screamed Murder again - the prisoner said to herget out of the room - she directly ran down stairs he followed after her and fetched her back into the yard and struck her on the left shoulder I was on the stairs and saw that - he pushed her violently up against the passage wainscot she said Oh you murdering villian you shall suffer for this - he pushed her out of the door again and told her if she came in again he would butcher her - I heard her scream out Murder several times and heard the blows down in my room several times Cross-examined Q How many people lodge in the house A Three other people have heard his blows as well as me I did not interfere nor speak to any one about it then HENRY CRUMP I know the prisoner and deceased were always quarrelling - but never saw any blows struck I have lived in the house as long as them my room is on the ground floor - I could hear them in my room nobody could get rest for them Prisoner s Defence I am not guilty GUILTY of Manslaughter only Aged 40 Transported for Life

I did not go down I heard my mother scream as soon as he went down stairs and I screamed also he came up stairs after staying down there about a quarter of an hour and then went out but my mother came up stairs first went out and then he went out - my mother had come up stairs first she did not enter the room where he was but opened the street door and went out he was in the room with me he took his son out with him - my mother came in in about an hour about nine o clock I observed then that her temple was very black and she complained very much of her breast - that was all she complained of she began to get tea ready and while she was getting it the prisoner came in - he did not say a word to her that I heard nor did she say any thing to him - she put a cup and sancer before him and began to pour him out some tea he said You need not pour any out for me I don t want any my mother said Then there is more for them that do be kept nagging at her - she said she did not want any discourse with him for he was a drunken man and a brutein heart he got up and said If you don t go out I will kick you out she said You need not do that for I can go out and she went -

nothing passed for about five minutes my mothere would have said nothing to him at all but his little boy was looking very steadfastly at him my mother said Come away child for he is no example for any child to look at but to bring them to the gallows - my father was very drunk then he got up and said What is that you say he made his way towards her and she flew out of the room down into Mrs Ralph s kitchen and he went after her - I heard her scream as soon as he went down but do not know what passed for I staid in the parlour my feet and legs were as unwell as they are now the witness was unable to walk - I heard her scream two or three times Mr Ralph ran down stairs from his bed-room and Mr Lachmere who lives in the house ran down after that my mother ran up to me took me out of the room and sat with me on the first floor stairs I heard the prisoner while we were there tell Mr Ralph he should leave him to-morrow and he was to give him a receipt -

between twelve and one o clock I heard my father out of his room in the passage saying Oh could he but find her he would kill her when my mother awoke I told her what I had heard - she said something to me and groans directly came into her throat and she immediately died she only said one word which was asking me if my father said it loud -

I do not recollect him my mother has lived with the prisoner since last summer twelve months - her name before that was Ellen Robinson - every body called us so but her own name was Rowberry the first house she lived at with the prisoner was in Catherine-street - she was known there by the name of Eleanor Robinson Q Has she gone by the name of Robinson ever since the death of your father till she lived with the prisoner A Yes - she was married to Rowberry at Islington church but I cannot find any thing for it when she lived with the prisoner she went by the name of Ellen McCarthy MR BODKIN Q Do you mean that your mother s name was Ellen or Eleanor A Eleanor when any body used to call her Ellen she would say her name was Eleanor MR CLARKSON Q How came you to tell me her name was Ellen A I thought you asked me whether her name was Robinson - she used always to say her name was Eleanor I have been ill since last March - the prisoner provided for us all he worked at the West Indiadocks - he had only 12s in his tobacco-box there had been no liquor in the room that day - my mother was in her own room all day cleaning up it might be between seven and eight or nine o clock when she went out - I do not know where she went she was gone about half an hour each time - it was on Sunday that she told his son not to look at him &c he got up and said What is that you say she made him no answer but went down and he after her - Ralph and Lachmere came down directly they heard her scream we had only a few beef bones boiling for broth for dinner on Sunday - she had nothing else no beer of any kind nor spirits she had no supper - she walked out both times on Saturday but when she came in she complained of her breast - she got up as usual on Sunday CATHERINE RALPH I keep the house in which the deceased lived it is in the parish of All Saints Poplar - the prisoner came home on the Saturday between five and six o clock I was down in the kitchen and heard words between them but could not distinguish what passed I looked up stairs and heard the deceased say Three shillings of this is owing for rent and what am I to do with the remainder the prisoner said Give it me I know what to do with it she said No it is owing elsewhere it is not yours I looked up to the room saw her coming out of their room door and the prisoner struck her - I ran up stairs and asked her to come down he struck her on the left side of the head with his double fist that was the first blow I saw - I was at the foot of the stairs and could not see whether it was violent I ran to her assistance and saw it swell directly she said to him Oh you rogue Oh you villian here is an eye you have given me she then gave me half a crown went into her own room and shut the door - I had some conversation with her about the half-crown and am sure she knew perfectly well what she was doing - I went into my own apartment and had not been long down stairs before words occurred between them again and she came down to me - the prisoner came after her and struck her two or three times I screamed murder - I was so terrified - I cannot say where he struck her but it appeared to me about her head for I stood between them to part them as well as I could - she and I both screamed Murder they appeared to be violent blows - he appeared in great anger - I did not notice that he said any thing Mrs Lachmere came down - she took hold of the prisoner and asked if he knew what he was about - upon that he struck her over her shoulder - it struck his wife and knocked her down Mrs Lachmere fell with her - she fell against the kitchen-table and upset it he then kicked his wife as she lay on the ground- he kicked her on the stomach between the two breasts that was done purposely for I saw him look at her lift his foot and kick her with violence Mr Lachmere came down and persuaded him to go up to his own room - he went up with him - he said the quarrel had been about money - I heard him call Mr Lachmere into his own room and say Look her Lash I have got half a sovereign but that is owing elsewhere I heard no more that night - the deceased had not been into my room all Saturday till this happened - I had seen her pass on the stairs - she had no appearance of being in liquor - she appeared in good health I did not see or hear the prisoner again till between one and two o clock on Sunday afternoon when I was taking up my dinner I heard words again and the deceased ran down to my room screaming violently McCarthy followed her into the room - he struck her with his double fist it appeared to me to be on the head or shoulder - I screamed for my husband who came down directly - Mr and Mrs Lachmere came down after him - my husband took him by the collar pulled him out of our room and he challenged my husband to go to fight - he appeared in liquour the poor woman afterwards got down some rags - I gave her two chairs to sit or in the empty kitchen and there she died - I got up at half-past five o clock a medical gentleman was sent for and examined her COURT Q Was it a kick or a stamp he gave her A A kick Cross-examined Q Did you know the deceased before she lived with the prisoner A yes she had lived with me in her first husband s time - he died at St Kitt s her name was Eleanor I have heard her called Ellen - she answered to both names she passed as the prisoner s wife - she always kept to her own room she did not sit with me - she dined on Sunday about three o clock in the empty kitchen which I had lent her I do not know whether she had been out that morning - she seemed to me to get the most blows about the head and shoulder except the kick the prisoner had offered to pay his rent and go directly - my husband said he should have the receipt tomorrow Mr Natorff was the first doctor that saw her and he said she was not dead MR ADOLPHUS Q Did Mr Natorff do any thing to her A Yes he bled her - not above two drops came from her he then had hot water put to her feet and then he said she was dead - he was not present at the opening of her body MR CLARKSON Q Did he not examine the whole of her person A he turned her round and examined her DOROTHY LACHMERE I lived at this house I went down to the kitchen on Saturday - the prisoner knocked his wife and me down and bruised my right shoulder and side I saw him on Sunday strike at his wife again but cannot say whether she received the blow RICHARD LACHMERE On the Saturday evening between five and six o clock I was in Ralph s kitchen and saw the prisoner kick his wife but cannot say in what part of her body as I was busy picking up my wife at the time JULIUS NATORFF I am a surgeon and a native of France I was called in at a quarter past six o clock on Monday morning and found the deceased s thorax and abdomen warm - I opened a vein and got I suppose half an ounce of blood I at first did not suppose life was extinct but put her feet into warm water and found she was dead - I examined her minutely outside but was not present when the body was opened I detected no appearance of bruises whatever - I could discern no cause of death Cross-examined Q Finding her still warm life could not have been extinct long A No but it is impossible to say how long it might have been half an hour - I examined the chest between the breasts there was no bruise of any kind to be seen Q Supposing a violent kick to have been given between the breasts about noon do not you think there must be some external mark A There would be a rupture of some small vessels and an extravasation of blood which would make its appearance at some time but when no medical man could tell - if the vessels are deep-seated the appearance would not be so quick if she had been beat on the temple and swelling followed there would have been some appearance of it - my examination did not lead me to form the least idea that she had died from personal violence I have said that to my judgment she died of apoplexy - I asked the beadle if I should open the body he said he had a medical man of his own - it is usual when two medical men see a body for both to be present at the opening MR ADOLPHUS Q What are you A A surgeon I keep an apothecary s shop at Limehouse about ten minutes walk from where the woman died - I never saw her before MARMADUKE TATHAM I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and am surgeon of Poplar parish for this year the beadle requested I would go immediately and examine the deceased - he pointed the body out to me laying on a bed-tick several people were there - I observed a few slight contusions on the anterior part of the head a little on one side I think on the right and about the fourth rib was another contusion I cannot say on which said - I did not think it would be material as I did not conceive any external appearance could be of any consequence I examined the abdomen externally and on the lower part of it was a discoloration on each side a little below the navel - perhaps a little more to the right than the left I then opened the head the dura mater was in a perfect uninflamed healthy state - the next two membraues were also uninflamed and healthy the lobes of the cerebrum both anterior and posterior were perfectly healthy- it was the most healthy brain I ever saw I found a slight degree of inflammation in the lungs commencing but not sufficient in my opinion to cause death - I then examined the abdomen and on laying bare the intestines I found a little below the smaller portion of the last intestine which covers the ilium in the highest degree of inflammatian and a considerable quantity of serum and some portion of coagulum lymph in the cavity of the abdomen which was the consequence of the inflammation - the uterus was also inflamed these are the principal appearances I observed - I have every reason to conclude that the immediate cause of death was the inflammation of the intestines the other causes had nothing whatever to do with the death neither the signs about the head nor the inflammation of the lungs - I had frequently seen the woman before having attended her child on the parish account she was Mrs McCarthy and lived in Sophia-street when I attended her - I never saw the prisoner till to-day Q Could the appearances of inflammation to which you ascribe her death have been occasioned by a blow or kick in the stomach within twenty-four hours A There is no doubt of it violence occasions inflammation and there was every mark of inflammation and the result of violence - if it had been internal inflammation the appearance would have been very different it was external inflammation - the Coroner and Jury viewed the body as I examined Cross-examined Q Your opinion is that the inflammation of the ilium was the cause of her death A Certainly that and no other - that intestine passes backwards and forwards in the lower part of the abdomen it is principally below the navel the jejunum begins where the ilium ends but there is no fixed point of division it is arbitrary - they are separated by an imaginary line Q Is not the upper part of the ilium called the jejunum A Decidedly not the intestine is five times the length of the body - the next intestine to the jejunum is the duodenum that is the upper one of all next the stomach that was in a perfectly healthy state and was full Q Now would not a kick given between the breasts rather have inflamed the duodenum and jejunum than the ilium A But I observed no kick between the breasts that could not have produced the inflammation if I had found the ilium as I did and had not heard of what had happened I should say it arose from external injury received in some way or other - I could come to no other conclusion I dissected with care to ascertain if there was any hernia Q Might not the same appearances of inflammation have arisen from other causes than violence A You make me something beyond human to decide what may be but from the appearance of the body I judge it arose from external violence I examined the body between eleven and twelve o clock - I was told by a person whom I had never seen before that some one had attempted to bleed her some hours after death - but I proceeded to examine the body as surgeon of the parish the marks on the abdomen were sufficiently plain to see there had been contusions - they were only slight but the woman dying so early the appearances would not be so plain as they might be a few days after - they would not be quite so visible at six o clock nobody was present but my pupil MR ADOLPHUS Q Were you informed of the name or address of any medical man who had been there A Not at all - if I had I should not have objected to his being present at the opening COURT Q You confine the cause of death to the inflammation of the ilium A Decidedly so blows where the contusion was might have caused the injury on that part - it corresponded with the commencing part of it but spread both lower and higher it was certainly connected with the contusion below the navel Q Would inflammation of that sort produce sudden death A That depends on the constitution inflammation increases much quicker with some than others the appearances I saw might have arisen in four or six hours inflammatory action proceeds at times very rapidly dissolution from inflammation is generally sudden I should have thought she must have felt considerable pain in the abdomen for some hours - death from inflammation sometimes takes place previous to mortification DOROTHY LACHMERE I saw the deceased after her death but did not examine her till after Mr Natorff was gone - I then saw a bruise on her forehead on her left temple and a bruise on her left side between the left breast and hip and an impression on the hip - this was the moment Mr Natorff left - when he came he did not know she was dead there was no other dead body in the house - I was not there when Mr Tatham saw it WILLIAM SMITH I am beadle of Poplar I went to Ralph s and saw the deceased I knew her before and knew her as Mrs McCarthy - I was present when Mr Tatham saw the body Prisoner s Defence She never wished me to pay my debts - that was the beginning of my falling out with her on Saturday GUILTY of manslaughter only Aged 41 Transported for Life 
t18310512-69  OLD COURT FRIDAY MAY 13 Second Middlesex Jury before Mr Justice Littledale 1056 THOMAS GALLAGHER EDWARD GALLAGHER MARTIN MORAN and ANN MORAN were indicted for the wilful murder of James Dockery MR ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution ELIZABETH WHITE I live in Lumley-court Strand On Sunday morning the 24th of April between eight and nine o clock I saw the prisoners and the deceased in Brewer s-court Bedfordbury - I saw Thomas Gallagher who worea straw hat holding the deceased by the collor and as the deceased was trying to make his escape the prisoner Thomas Gallagher caught him by the collar and struck him several times with his fist - the deceased did not strike again but only tried to escape Edward Gallagher was there and struck him once on the neck with his fist - that is all I saw him do I heard the people round say that the quarrel began on account of the man s religion - I did not hear either of the prisoners say any thing I saw Thomas Gallagher strike him twice on the head with a stick - he then fell to the ground it was a long stick a good deal like a broom-bandle - this was after Edward struck him he fell to the ground and then the people round cried Murder I went away and saw no more - Thomas Gallagher put his hat over his face shouched and walked up Bedfordbury - Thomas Gallagher did not appear in any way in liquor he walked up the street very steadily - I did not notice the others Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How far from Bedfordbury do you live a It is a good way - my is huband was not with me I had just got up and was going on some business for myself Q What was the first you saw of the transaction A I heard a noise I was then in Bedfordbury one or two doors from Brewer s-court - I cannot tell when the quarrel began I did not go quite close to them - Thomas Gallagher did not appear very angry I saw them in the court not in any house - I was there about a quarter of an hour there were seven or eight people there when I first went up - I knew none of them they did not go in doors while I was there - I am sure Thomas Gallagher had the back in his hand when he struck him I cannot tell where the stick came from - I never saw it till it was in his hand just before he struck him he struck him with his fist at first - he had no stick in his hand when he held him by the coller Cross-examined by MR BROKIN Q Are these people natives of Ireland A I have heard so - a great many irish live there I do not know where Edward Gallagher lives MR ADOLPHUS Q Gallagher struck him first with his fist how long after that did he strike him with the stick A Two or three minutes - this is the stick looking at the handle of a bricklayer s server produced by Wilson this iron part which is now broken off was not on when I saw it - when he was struck he fell to the ground and was bleeding at the mouth and nose what had happend before I came I cannot tell MARY WRIGHTSON I am single and live in Brewer s-court Bedfordbury On Sunday morning the 24th of April I was looking out of window and saw Thomas Gallagher draw the deceased out by his collar and throw him on the stones in a very violent manner - he dragged him out of the house where he lodges Thomas Gallagher and the deceased lodge in the same house - I went in and saw no more I merely saw him drag him out by the collar - he chucked him down in a spiteful manner on the stones on his face I observed nothing further - I saw nobody there but Thomas Gallagher and the deceased I knew them both by sight but had no acquaintance with them Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Have you lived long in the court A Yes six years - the Irish live in that house I was drawing up the window when I saw this - I had heard no noise I was accidentally looking out of window - I am certain nobody else was there MR ADOLPHUS Q How many houses are there in the court A Seven - I live at No 8 the Irish live at No 4 which is next door PETER GILLDAY I live in Brewer s-court On the 24th of April I saw Thomas Gallagher drag the deceased Dockery out of the outer door of the house - neither of them said any thing he had hold of him by the collar and let him fall down on the stones on his back Q Do you mean that he let him fall by his own weight A I cannot say I suppose he meant to put him down out of his hand on the flags - he was apparently dead then to me nobody else was there - I immediately went and fetched a Policeman I came back with him and found in my absence the deceased had been taken into No 4 again - I did not see him again till he was in his coffin Q Then at the time you saw him brought out of the house there was no scuffle A No - Thomas Gallagher dragged him out by the collar with his heels on the door cill he appeared dead then - this was between eight and half-past nine o clock I saw nobody by JEREMIAH CORCORAN I live in Doke s-court Little Dean-street Westminster - I did not know the deceased but I know all the prisoners On Sunday morning the 24th of April I was at my brother s and heard a cry of Murder I put my head out of the window which is in the next court - there is only a wall between I could see into Brewer s-court and saw Thomas Gallagher draw the deceased out by the collar and throw him on the stones - he seemed to me quite helpless I could not say whether he was dead or alive - he did not strike him then he only threw him on the stones - he then went down the court I came down stairs went into the court and he came back again towards where the man was and said to the deceased If you recover yourself I will come and see you at night again the deceased was taken in doors by somebody and I saw no more of him- I was there when the Policeman came which was in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before the deceased was taken in I observed blood on the side of his head and about his mouth - this was after he was thrown on the stones I cannot say whether it was there when he was first brought out of the house - he appeared to me to be dead when he laid on the stones JAMES FOX I live in Brewer s-court on the second floor On the 24th of April I got out of bed about ten minutes before eight o clock or ten minutes after and on coming into my sitting-room I heard a screaming in the court - I put my head out of window and saw Thomas Gallagher drag the deceased out into the court and drap him on the pavement right opposite the door I walked down stairs directly in my shirt-sleeves came down as far as the body and he seemed apparently dead - I saw no marks of violence except a little blood on his face I turned from the body walked down towards the court and stood close to the pump - shortly after Thomas Gallagher walked down to me and said Fox why have you not been to the row I said I don t want to be he told me that Meran and his lodger meaning James Dockery the deceased had been pitching it into him and said Would you take it ill of me to take my own part pitcking means striking or assaulting him - he walked down towards the bottom of the court and shortly after a Policeman walked into the court passed him not knowing him and went up to where the deceased laid - Gallagher walked towards the bottom of the court and shortly after Martin Moran the prisoner walked from Bedfordbury into the court the body had at that time been moved into Moran s apartment - I did not see it moved but afterwards saw it there and have no doubt of its being James Dackery s body when Martin Moran walked into the court I asked him where he had been as a man was apparently dead in his house - he said he had been in search of a Policeman to give charge of Thomas Gallagher and Dockery for having a row in his house that is all I saw - I was taken up by the Policeman and discharged by him on promising to give evidence Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Thomas Gallagher told you Moran and the deceased had been pitching into him and Moran said the deceased and Gallagher had a row in his house A Yes JOHN WILSON I am a serjeant of the Police On the morning of the 24th of April I was fetched to this court by Gillday I got there about nine o clock in the morning and found the court full of people - I inquired where the fight was and was told at No 4 I went to No 4 - the door was closed I asked for admittance - Mrs Moran asked my business I said I understood a man was either killed or dying - she said there was nothing the matter there had only been a spree with a couple of her lodgers and that the man was not dead - I then shoved the door and it opened she then said Now you may come in I said I don t thank you for that because I had opened the door myself - I entered the front room on the ground floor where Mrs Moran lived and there saw a corpse laying across the bed I felt the man and he was quite cold both his breast and forehead - I then saw blood on Mrs Moran s arm from her elbow to her wrist and took her into custody I took her to the station-house when I got assistance I went for a surgeon to inspect the body - Moran s husband had gone away then I had seen him when I first came into the court but did not know he was her husband after I came from the station I took Moran into custody - I found him at the bottom of Bedfordbury he had not gone away - he also had blood on his hands and was apparently in liquor I could not say he was drunk but he had been drinking - I took hold of him he said he would not be handled by a Policeman but I still held him and took him to the station by order of the superintendent I went back to search the house - I then found the stick produced under the bed where the deceased was laying the superintendent came afterwards and found the iron server belonging to it not far from where the stick was he turned the bed up and found it - when I found the stick it was in the state it is now in with a few drops of blood on it and the server had some hair to it it appears to me to he human hair - it adhered to it quite close as if it had been a blow Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Have you had that stick ever since A No it has been locked up in the superintendent s room - we have not washed it here is the mark of blood - the stick is split at one end - I only know that I found it I cannot say in whose hand it had been - Mrs Moran might have soiled her hand with blood if she had laid hold of it human hair is sometimes used with mortar I believe for a shift - the server is used to scoop mortar it had been in mortar - there are only small particles of mortar on it now Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q You expected to find the deceased at No 4 living or dead A Yes - I pushed the door open with my hand I gave one push and it opened - the room is four or five feet from the outer door Q If a man had received an injury and was taken into the house is it not very probable he would be taken into that room A Yes there is another room on the side but that is a sitting-room there were a great many lodgers in the house MR ADOLPHUS Q Was there any fresh or moist mortar on the server to which the bair could be A No- the bair was on the edge of it I did not compare the hair with any thing JOSEPH SADLER THOMAS I am a superintendent of the Police I went to Brewer s-court with a party of officers on receiving information about a quarter-past nine o clock - I found a great number of persons assembled in the court and considerable confusion I entered the house No 4 and found a dead man laying on the floor - I observed his face and neck greatly discoloured and a slight contusion on the right side of the nose his face appeared to have been recently but very imperfectly washed - I inquired who had done it the female prisoner was present - I was answered by several voices Thomas Gallagher I inquired for him and was answered by Ann Moran Oh he is off - you will not get him I then ordered the officers to guard the house and suffer nobody to escape I secured every person in the house - Wilson took Mrs Moran and Martin Moran came having promised Wilson he would do so I examined the apartment and in the room facing Moran s on the left I perceived marks of fresh blood on the wall - there were three beds in that room I found the server in Moran s room under the bed which was then turned up - the body was on the floor when I entered I examined the body more particularly and found a wound on the back part of the skull - it appeared a sort of bruised wound which might be made with a stick and certainly not with an iron cutting instrument I found this hair on the server producing three hairs - I saw several spots of what appeared to me to be blood in the front of Ann Moran s dress it might have happened by her moving the deceased about if he had been brought in wounded on the following morning she had either sucked or washed out those stains - I sent an officer for Thomas Gallagher and he brought him in in half an hour JOHN MURDOCK I apprehended Thomas Gallagher at the Three Augels in Long-acre about half-past nine o clock that morning - it is about five minutes walk from Brewer s-court JOHN NATHAN BAINBRIDGE I am a surgeon I was called in to view the body of the deceased two other gentlemen were present - I made notes of my examination heappeared to have been a stout well-formed healthy man - I found a wound on the head which had penetrated some depth into the scalp on moving the scalp there was a considerable quantity of blood or serum also on the chest it is my opinion that the cause of his death was the extravasation of blood on the brain and that external violence such as blows or a fall would cause GEORGE DOUCHEZ I am a surgeon and assisted Mr Bainbridge - I agree perfectly with his evidence PATRICK BARRETT I am a surgeon and was present I agree with the evidence given Thomas Gallagher s Defence I struck in my own defence - he struck me first for not giving him some of the gin which the women sent me out for Edward Gallagher s Defence I stand before the bar of justice with a clear conscience and am innocent of the charge on the morning in question between seven and eight o clock I and one of my fellow lodgers went into the Black Horse at the corner of May s-buildings - I returned home about eight o clock with three loaves under my arm I brought them into the second floor front room of the house where this transaction happened and from that time was never in the court nor down stairs till the Policeman came about nine o clock so that I know no more about it than a man in France White has merely come for the sake of her expences to swear my life away - no man in the court can say there was a row there when she says she saw me and my brother strike the deceased she could not identify me at the first examination when Sir Richard Birnie told her to point out the two men whom she saw strike the deceased - she could not point out one I am a very remarkable man and can be known among two or three people - she could not identify my brother till Mr Thomas said Did the man wear a straw hat Yes said she - whatever Thomas asked she said yes to whether it was right or wrong she did not point me out- I was remanded from the first examination till Wednesday when I was brought up but not examined I was brought up on the Thursday and discharged with others from the bar and as I went home to my lodging by the Horse and Groom two Policemen came and said You are the man we want and that I must come back - I went with them to Covent-garden watch-house Mr Thomas had the woman up stairs - he fetched her down and pointing to me said Is that the man Yes said she that is the man who struck him in the court and on the inquest she swore there were four men besides me and my brother striking the deceased - but at Bow-street she swore it was only two men holding him and the others striking him the witnesses against my brother can swear there was no row in the court - I have proof that I was in my chair fast asleep when it happened my landlady and three others can swear I was not down after I brought the loaves up till after it happened - I did not know what was the matter till I was in the watch-house I never saw the deceased in my life to the best of my knowledge - I hope my Lord you will weigh it in your bosom why did not the woman identify me at first I am remarkable enough to be known - White I understand is a very bad character I sent a person to her last week and she said she might make a mistake Martin Moran s Defence I know nothing of the business - I went out at half-past six in the morning and left two lodgers in the room with my wife I never came back till half-past eight or a quarter to nine and all the people in the house were then taken prisoners - the Police man asked if I was landlord of the place I said I was - he told me to come with him Ann Moran Dockery brought in two women in the morning and he had the bonnet of one of them in his hand - I said Who owns that bonnet he said That is my business - I said I don t want you bringing in women intoxicated to my place one woman said Never mind sendout for 6d worth of gin - I said I don t want gin he told Tom Gallagher to go out for 6d worth - he was a long time gone the women asked what kept him so long - somebody said something about the women taking the gin in the street Dockery said Never mind if Gallagher don t bring it in he will be sorry for it - one of the women said Never mind it and the two women walked out when Thomas Gallagher came in they began words - I told them not to be at words on Sunday and if my husband came in he would kick up a row with me Dockery said they had a right to do as they liked in their own place - Dockery struck Tom Gallagher he returned the blow and struck him - the back of his head came against the bedstead I ran out and said I will not have a row in my house - I went to the bottom of the court but could not see a Policeman I said Oh Murder here is Tom Gallagher will be murdered send for a Policeman to take them away - as I came back Tom Dockery had the man out at the door I saw no wounds - I asked what was the reason they were going so far with it and who brought him out - Who did said Tom but those that were able to do it - Mrs King and I brought the man into my house no Policeman was to be found - I have plenty of proof that my door was wide open when the Policeman and doctor came some of the blood came on my arm in carrying him in but I had no part in it ELIZABETH WHITE When I was first examined on this charge my deposition was read over to me and I made a mark to it - I was so agitated I did not say any thing about Edward Gallagher at the first examination I could not distinguish him and could not bring him to mind WILLIAM BURNABY I am a clerk at Bow-street office On the Thursday Edward Gallagher was discharged with others - White at that time could not identify him she had seen him with others but about half an hour afterwards he was brought back with White and it was then she said he had struck a blow - she had a full opportunity of seeing him before and on the Monday ELIZABETH WHITE re-examined I did not see Edward Gallagher on Monday - I went only twice on the Thursday and I described him to Mr Thomas before he was brought in - I was not there when the men were discharged I was not there on Thursday till after they were discharged - I never saw Edward Gallagher till I saw him in the watch-house Mr Thomas was there - he sent for him after I had described him I did not know what I was going to the watch-house for - he stood alone when he was shown to me my husband is a labourer and I sometimes go out to work MR BURNABY I do not exactly recollect whether she was at Bow-street twice on Thursday JOSEPH SADLER THOMAS I sent for White to the station on Thursday morning - she did not come in time to go to Bow-street she described Edward Gallagher before she saw him and when he was produced she immediately recognized him without the slightest difficulty - I then took her to Bow-street and she swore to him firmly she was only there once that day MR BODKIN Q Were you there on Monday A Yes Edward Gallagher was at the bar when she was examined but he stood back and she was considerably agitated - she described him as having a defect in his nose - Edward Gallagher had the appearance of being asleep when he was taken T GALLAGHER - GUILTY of manslaughter only Aged 25 Transported for Life E GALLAGHER -

t18320906-65  OLD COURT FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 7 Second Middlesex Jury before Mr Baron Bailey 1791 CATHERINE BAINBRIDGE was indicted for the wilful murder of William Francis ELIZABETH BOWLES I lived at No 4 Match-walk Shadwell the prisoner lodged with William Francis in the room facing mine - they had lived there together not quite a week both came there together - whether they had lived together before I cannot say On the 19th of July Francis came home between eleven and twelve o clock before the prisoner I saw him - he did not appear to me at all intoxicated nor elevated with liquor he appeared to me ruffled in his temper - he knocked at my door and asked for a light I gave him one and while I was getting it he put his hands together and said to me You would have been frightened to hear the expressions she has been calling me up in Shoreditch he said she had said she would not let him come in that night and he would not let her in the prisoner came up stairs in about a quarter of an hourshe opened the room door and went in I heard him tell her to go out - I did not hear whether she made any answer I then heard basins plates and things being broken - I could not tell whether they were striking each other but there was a great rustle between them which continued a very few minutes whether any blows were given I cannot possibly tell but I heard her say I will stab you with a knife she had been in the room a very few mintes when I heard that - it was altogether a very few minutes they had been rustling together before I heard her say that she almost immediately called Nancy Nancy meaning Leonard who lived in the room underneath she seemed frightened - Leonard went up immediately I was partly undressed and did not go into the room till the Policeman took the prisoner away I then went and asked for a light I had heard no words between them but what I have stated - there were words between them but what I could not understand it was before she said she would stab him - but they were both in a passion and I could not understand what was said nor tell whether any blows were given there might or might not be blows - I heard the crockery breaking before I heard her say she would stab him the deceased was about fifty years old or more - he was a very powerful man Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q He was a black I believe A A tawney - he appeared a foreigner I had not seen the prisoner the early part of the day and did not see her come in that night - I was in my room with the door closed I knew her by her voice COURT Q How many minutes do you think she had been in the room before she said she would stab him A I suppose five or six - they had been quarrelling all that time ANN LEONARD I lodge in the same house - Francis had been there six days I knew the prisoner before she came to that house she had only lived with Francis about a week the last time - she had lived with him before and they parted when he went to sea he had returned about a week - I was not at home on the 19th when he came in but was at home when the prisoner came in and heard her go into her room I had not heard Francis say any thing before that - when she had been there about five minutes she called out Nancy two or three times pretty quick she did not seem much flurried - if she had not called I should not have known any thing had happened I had heard the crockery breaking but how it was broken or by whom I cannot tell - the prisoner said when I went up stairs that she had broken it when I went up stairs I found the prisoner laying on the floor and Francis had his foot on part of her body and her hair in his hand and he was aiming to strike her - she had her cap off I said Francis what are you doing he put his hand to his breast and said See what Kitty has done his breast was streaming with blood - it was all over blood I thought he had a red flannel waistcoat on - I asked Catherine how she had done it she said she had thrown the bason at him - nothing more passed the prisoner was very much in liquor - whether he had beat her when she came home I cannot tell I have known him beat her - his temper was violent I do not know whether he was in liquor Cross-examined Q Did you ever know him to bite her A I did not see him bite her but she showed me a mark on her arm they did not lodge in our house then but we lodged with the deceased Q Had she been in the habit of calling you before A No she used to get out of his way when they quarrelled she has often got out of his way because she was afraid of him - I live in the room under them she called loud enough for me to hear a struggle might happen in the room without my hearing it - they so often quarrelled I did not notice whether there was struggling or not the breaking of the crockery sounded loud as if it was dashed about the room when I went up he was making an aim to strike her with his fist and had hold of her hair to beat her she could not get away from him COURT Q Had you seen her that evening before A Yes at the George and Dragon about half-past eleven o clock and desired her to come home she came home in a few minutes - I told her to come home as I knew how he used to beat her and I was afraid he would beat her for being out late she did not express any unwillingness to go home nor ill-will against him - she went directly he was very jealous of her MARY SPURDEN I lived in the same house as Francis I was in bed and heard him come home alone and in about a quarter of an hour I heard the prisoner come home - she went up stairs - I did not hear her go into her room as soon as she got up stairs I heard him say You shan t come in and heard her say she would come in I heard no quarrelling or scuffling - I heard the crockery break-I heard a rustling as if he was endeavouring to keep her out and she was endeavouring to get in it appeared as if only one person was throwing crockery about by whom it was thrown I cannot tell - I heard the prisoner call Nancy three times quickly as if she wished her to come up as soon as she could I should not have known any thing had happened if she had not called - I went up stairs the man was then laying under the window and the prisoner sitting on a chest JOHN DOUGLAS I am a Policeman On the night of the 19th of July about five minutes before I went up to the room I was in the street and heard the prisoner call out Little Ann Little Ann very lond a great many times as if she was anxious for her to come - I heard nothing more till I was called up the first thing I then saw was the deceased in an inclining position over the back of the chair - the prisoner was going about the room backwards and forwards as if in distress I noticed the blood spurting from a wound in the deceased s right breast - I then said he had been stabbed the prisoner replied No he has not been stabbed - I have only set his nose bleeding by throwing a basin at him I then looked at him and saw another wound bleeding fresh over his left eye - I said again to the prisoner This man has been stabbed she said No he had not - I looked about and just on the other side of the room by a chair I picked up this knife there are marks of blood on it particularly on the lower part and high up it is greasy the other knives in the room were not of the same kind as this - they were all round points when I picked the knife up the prisoner said That is not the knife it was little Ann s knife - I turned round to little Ann and asked where her knife was Tucker said she had taken little Ann s knife down stairs - I went down to little Ann s room and on a table found a knife which I now produce there are no marks of blood on that - the knife was damp I took the prisoner to the station-house when I told her I must take her into custody she immediately rushed to the table and took another knife out of a drawer which I took from her and as we were going to the station-house she said This is through my speaking to another man - she afterwards said he had no business to leave his money in Old-street as he had and that he had left 20l odd with somebody else in Shoreditch Cross-examined Q How far were you from the house when you heard the cry for little Ann A I stood in the street opposite to the house the window was shut - I had been there before on account of hearing them talk loud I had heard a noise about ten minutes before from the same room from the prisoner only I did not see her but knew her voice - she had been released from the deceased s grasp when I got up and was pacing the room the knife is a table knife - the deceased was cook on board ship I found the room in confusion broken crockery laid about and some was outside there was no cloth on the table the crockery was dinner articles SARAH TUCKER I am landlady of the house - the prisoner took the lodgings for herself and Francis - I heard him come in on the night of the 19th I was in bed and heard the prisoner come in about half an hour after him - I heard the crockery breaking and heard her call Nancy two or three times I went into the room almostly directly and saw the deceased with his foot on the prisoner s body her hair in his hand and his hand was rising as if he was about to strike her but he seemed very faint - he gave me a round pointed knife out of his hand - it was Ann Leonard s he turned round when I saw the blood on his breast and said See what Kitty has done - he did not say what had been done with that knife that was all he could say - the knife he gave me was not bloody when he turned round I saw a great cut over his left eye - when I saw the blood on his shirt I said What have you been doing the prisoner said I threw the basin at him when he said See what Kitty has done - he staggered and fell I saw him die in a very short time - he was in the habit of beating her violently he was passionate - he would scarcely speak while he was beating her Cross-examined Q I believe this is also a table knife A Yes the large knife belonged to the deceased - he used to keep it in his room it is rather sharp he had a knife in his hand while he was bleeding - ithad no blood on it that I saw it was in the hand he was aiming with to strike her COURT Q Then if he had had strength you think he would have struck her with that knife A Yes WILLIAM BUTLER I am a Policeman On the 19th of July a little before ten o clock I was on duty and saw the prisoner and deceased at the top of Old Gravel-lane having a great many words - Andrews my brother officer was coming up the lane and moved them on they crossed the road and went on quarreling - hesaid Kitty I will have no row with you to night he crossed over on myside again - she started off and ran for nearly fifty yards then stopped and looked back - when he got nearly opposite to her she said You shall not come into the room to night - I will go home and fasten the door or fasten you out I saw nothing more till I went up to the room after the deceased was stabbed - as Douglas was going to the watch-house with the prisoner I heard her say she did not do it if she did it was with the crockery I picked the crockery up and examined it as narrowly as I could but could find no marks of blood except one drop on a little bit as if it had come from his eye - as I was taking the deceased down stairs to go to the hospital he died Cross-examined Q Were they both sober at ten o clock A The prisoner had certainly been drinking -I have known her a good while I never saw them quarrel before - I had not seen the man above three times JOHN TRIPE I am a surgeon Mr Bird was called in to see the deceased I examined the body about seven o clock in the evening - the death was occasioned by a wound on the right side of the chest either of these knives would produce that wound JOHN WILLIAM BIRD I examined the body the stab in the chest was the cause of death either of these knives would produce it - the blow seems to have been struck on the collar-bone and the large knife was bent in the blade- I cannot say which knife it was done with ANN LEONARD The small knife is mine the prisoner had asked me to lend it to her on the Monday I lent her two knives and forks GUILTY of manslaughter Aged 22 Transported for Life 
t18331017-54  OLD COURT Friday October 18 1833 Second Middlesex Jury before Mr Justice Park 1460 ROBERT EMMETT was indicted for the wilful murder of George Ashton GEORGE CROW I am a plumber and glazier I was in Globe-lane on Saturday night the 5th of October about a quarter before seven o clock it was then dark I heard some boy s wrangling there were four of them altogether - I saw the prisoner and two with him and one other I saw the prisoner and Ashton near to each other about two feet apart hearing them wrangling I went to the door and stepped into the road and heard the prisoner say to George Ashton If you come back I will stab you - the prisoner then put his right hand into his left hand pocket and took something from it I cannot tell whether it was a knife or what - Ashton turned towards him but never lifted his hand to strike him he did not advance towards him at all he only turned his foot and he never lifted his hand at all that I saw the prisoner then instantly thrust forth his right arm to the left breast of the deceased and the decesed fell into my arms saying Oh he has stabbed me take him away - I did not see anything in the prisoner s hand - I took a knife from him at the station-house in about five minutes - he had it in his left hand pocket I took it from his pocket it was shut then I afterwards saw it open it was a double bladed knife I saw the large blade open and there was a stain of blood on it the deceased was about eighteen years old when he fell into my arms I gave him to a young man to take care of while I took the prisoner to the station-house Ashton died at the London hospital - the prisoner did not attempt to go away he remained standing there while I had deceased in my arms he might easily have gone away - it was a momeutary act - there was a gas lamp that enabled me to see this I saw nothing of the beginning of the dispute THOMAS FORDHAM I am a carpenter I live near the place - I was within ten yards of these parties at first I came nearer to them - I heard the prisoner who is a sweep say to George Ashton If you come back I will stab you - I was not near enough to observe whether he was crying - I ran up as fast as I could and when I got to them the deceased had turned round towards the prisoner and was within about two feet of him - I saw the prisoner plunge a knife into him - I did not see the knife but he struck at him with something the deceased fell into Crow s hands - I did not hear him say anything - I saw two sweeps there near him they did nothing - the prisoner was standing up when I first saw him - I had not seen him coming out of any shop - Crow came out of a baker s shop - Nicholls and Stroud were with the deceased they were very near when he was stabbed- the prisoner appeared very violent and as if he had been put in a passion - he was very violent I did not see anything in his hand before he struck the deceased - the deceased was returning to the prisoner when I saw them - he was moving towards the prisoner - I saw him move towards him after the prisoner said If you come I will stab you - the prisoner appeared in a great rage when he said that - I did not see him take the knife out of his pocket for all I know he might have had it in his hand before Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q About how far was the deceased from the prisoner when he said If you come back I ll stab you A I was about a hundred yards off the last time I heard him say it he was about two feet off he said so two or three times - I could not see them the first time it was said - I might have heard it said three times - he was about three feet off the last time I heard it said - if the deceased had chosen he might have gone away instead of returning to the prisoner - he was older than the prisoner and a great deal larger and stouter - it was said in the voice of a person who was in great anger - I did not hear the prisoner say he had hit him in the eye with a tobacco-stopper - I am sure the deceased walked towards him JEPTHA MILLER I am sixteen years old On Saturday night about a week ago I was with the prisoner and another sweep named John Potter at a quarter before seven o clock - I was quite sober I don t know how the others were - we had been to a sugar-house we had not been to a public-house - the deceased met us there were two more boys with him they were doing nothing - as they passed by Emmett said He is a gone off - he did not point to any one in particular - the deceased had gone on about ten yards before he said that on the prisoner s saying that he came back and hit him in the face - it was a smart blow I was near him and the blow almost struck me I heard the blow - the prisoner fell down from the blow and cried out - when he was on the ground the deceased kicked him on the thigh I saw that - he only kicked him once he did it with violence - Emmett began to cry and then called the deceased a twopenny-halfpenny thief - the deceased went towards his companions and the prisoner told him if he came back he would stick a knife into him he said that immediately - the deceased came back in a minute or two and was going to hit him he lifted his hand up - then the prisoner put his hand into his pocket and took something out - I don t know what prevented the deceased hitting him his hand was cleanched when he lifted it up towards him - I did not see the knife in the prisoner s hand but he put his hand into his pocket as if to take something out - I did not know the prisoner before we are not under the same master but the other boy knew him - I am quite sure I saw the deceased strike him the first time and afterwards kick him on the ground and afterwards he offered to strike him again - it was not so much as three minutes between the first blow and his coming up the second time - I knew the deceased by sight before his name was George Ashton Cross-examined Q Did it appear to you that whatever the prisoner did was in defence of himself when Ashton was going to strike him A Yes JOHN DAWSON I am a pupil at the London hospital The deceased was brought in on the 5th of October a little after seven o clock in the evening I saw him immediately after he came in he was brought there by four men on a shutter HENRY MONATT I went with the deceased to the London hospital and delivered him to this gentleman JOHN DAWSON I saw him immediately he was brought in he lived five or ten minutes - I afterwards examined his body - there was a wound between the third and fourth ribs on the left side it had entered the heart and was about two inches deep that no doubt was the cause of death it had pierced the heart - I saw the knife before the Coroner such a knife would have inflicted that wound William Brazier a chimney-sweeper gave the prisoner a good character for kindness of disposition GUILTY Aged 15 - Of manslaughter only Transported for Fourteen Years 
t18350202-585  585 GEORGIANA CLARK was indicted for the wilful murder of Henry Jenkins WILLIAM DUNSTAN STANLEY I am one of the beadles of St Pan-cras On Monday evening the 26th of January between six and seven o clock I was passing along Zion-terrace to Argyle-place—I saw a number of people collected—I went up stairs in a house in Argyle-place in the front room first floor and saw five or six persons there and a man lying dead on the bed—the prisoner was sitting on the side of the bed near the corpse—I asked her how the man came by the cut in his side which I could see it was bound up but I put the wadding on one side and saw it —she said by cutting a piece of wood to put on the fire—I asked her if she was a married woman—she said she was married to Jenkins the deceased—I asked her where the knife was—Phoebe Davidson came up stairs and took the knife out of the cupboard—I asked Davidson if that was the knife—she said it was—I said Can you swear to its being the knife —she said Yes it is is it not George speaking to the prisoner and the prisoner said it was—I produce that knife—I then asked the prisoner to tell me whether she actually was a married woman or not and she replied that she was not—I asked her if she and Jenkins had had any quarrel—she said they had on the Saturday night about Phoebe Davidson—she said the quarrel was because Davidson would not come up to sup with them—Davidson lodged down stairs—I found so many people there I said nothing further but desired them not to bury the body until an inquest was held—I went down stairs and went to a neighbouring beer-shop and not feeling satisfied I sent for Campbell a sergeant of police—he came and we both went to Dr Jones that night and from what Dr Jones told us we felt ourselves in duty bound to take the prisoner into custody—I went to the station-house and then returned and got the deceased s clothes which I have here—there is a cut in the clothes—it has gone through the great-coat—the prisoner said the clothes were hanging up behind the door and I found them there—the cut has gone through the great-coat and two waistcoats in the place corresponding with where the man was cut in the side and it corresponds with the knife—his shirt was cut also in the same place—there was no under-coat—the shirt has been found since—I did not see it found—there was no appearance of any wood being cut in the room Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did you know the deceased A I did not—I had not seen Dr Jones in the room when I went there—I had seen him below in the house—he was just coming out—there were five or six persons in the room—they seemed much alarmed at the man s death—there was a great deal of wretchedness and misery—the prisoner appeared agitated and distressed SAMSON DORKIN CAMPBELL police-sergeant E 14 I went on Monday evening with Stanley in consequence of what he said—we got there about half-past seven o clock and found the prisoner in the room sitting on the foot of the bed—there were other people in the room—I asked her if she was the person who cohabited with the deceased—she replied she was—I asked her then how the accident had taken place by which the man had lost his life—she said that in cutting some wood to put on the fire to fry some sausages the knife had slipped and cut him—she said it was on the Saturday night—I asked her if there were any other persons in the room except herself and the deceased at the time of the accident—she said none—I asked her whether she had alarmed any of the inmates of the house previous to fetching the doctor—she said she had not—I learned from her that Mrs Wilkins and her daughter lodged in the front parlour and a young woman named Phoebe Davidson in the back parlour—those were the only persons she mentioned to me—I asked her whether she and the deceased were good friends or had any words within a short time of the accident—she said Oh yes we were quite good friends —I said Are you quite sure that you had no quarrel at all with him shortly before that —she said I will tell you the truth we had a few words he lifted his hand to strike me I turned ray back from him towards the table and at the same moment I saw he had lifted his hand I heard him call out Oh I am cut —I asked her how could that be reconciled with her former statement that he had been cutting wood as he could not be doing two things at once cutting wood and string her at the same time—I used these very words to her—she made no answer—I asked her if she had any objection to tell me the subject of the dispute between her and the decesed —she said It was relative to the young woman Phonebe Davision who lived in the back parlour and he went to strike me in consequence of the words we had about her —I then told her I should feel it my duty to take her into custody which I did—she remained in my custody during the night—she stated that at the moment she found he had met with the accident she ran for Mr Jones the surgeon—she apppeared very much distressed and agitated—in fact it was with some difficulty I could get her from the body—I tore her from it—she threw herself on the corpse and I could hardly get her from it—Phobe Davidson was present during the whole conversation—the prisoner stated in her presence that the deceased was very angry with her because Phoebe Davision would not came up to supper—she remained in my custody all night and about six or seven o clock in the morning I ascertained a Catholic clegryman had visited the man—I went to her to ask where he lived—she said she did not know and she said Oh Jenkins Jenkins little did I think it would have come to this you have often threatened to stab me and yourself but little did I think it would have come to this —I said You do not mean to say he stabbed himself do you —she said He might have done it for my back was towards him —I said You told me last night you always lived very happily together —she said Oh no he has often beat me and left me weltering in my blood as my late landlady who lived next door can testify Cross-examined Q Did she tell you how long they had cohabited together A I think she said they had been together nearly four years—Phoebe Davision is single I understand she had a child in her arms—the prisoner apperared in an afficted state at the time—in such a state as I should expect to find a woman who had lost her husband—I think Phoebe Davision was in the room the whole time—these persons were in very poor circumstances—I called on her landlady next door and had a conversation with her on the subject to which she referred—the story was confirmed to a certain excent by the landlady—she mentioned one instance that she knew of—she stated that they had been together to market that Saturday—it apperared according to the statement made in the prisoner s presence that the deceased Wilkins and herself had been drinking together after his horse—the house is a loading house in Argyle-place which is between Judd-street and King s-cross—I understood the deceased to have gone himself once to Mr Jones after he was wounded WILLIAM JONES I am a surgeon and live in Judd-street I was not acquainted with the deceased before the accident—on Saturday the 24th between ten and twelve o clock in the evening I saw him at No 1 Argyle-place—the prisoner came to my house for me to go—she seemed very much distressed—I went with her and found the deceased in the front room up stairs—I do not recollect whether he was in bed—he stated that he had cut himself in cutting wood—the prisoner was with me—on examining I found an oblique would extending between the seventh and eighth rib on the left side about three quarters of an inch long—it appeared to be made with a sharp instrument penetrating obliquely from the left side to the right—it had entered on the left side—there was only blood on the shirt—the bleeding of the wound had ceased—his pulse was affected but I do not conceive it was from the blood lost but rather from the shock or fear in his mind from the accident—I did not think seriously of the wound—having dressed it to cheer him up I told him to consider himself more frightened than hurt—being an oblique wound it was impossible to state what would be the result as I could not see to what depth it had gone—I then gave him some ammonia &c with an idea of accelerating the pulse to raise the pulse to bring on re-action—the next morning about eight o clock I was surprised to find him at my house which is about one hundred or one hundred and fifty yards from where he lived—I found his pulse considerably accelerated and fuller—he complained of pain in his stomach—I have learnt since that he had taken something to injure him—I immediately ordered him to be bled to produce fainting—I ordered him to be sent to bed and kept quietly and to take two ounces of castor oil—I intended him to be bled till it produced that effect on the pulse—that is a general rule when we order bleeding to faint—my assistant bled him in my shop instantly—he was to walk home after he had rallied from the fainting—my assistant is in the habit of bleeding under my direction four and five times a week—I have found a good effect from bleeding for incipient inflammation—the pulse was fuller than it was the night before—the characteristic pulse is a small pulse but a quick pulse—this was on Sunday morning—I saw him twice that day—in addition to that he was ordered to have a mustard poultice applied all over his stomach—this was at eight o clock in the morning—he died at six o clock the following day—he did not die from any internal bleeding but from peritoneal inflammation— I examined the body after death on Tuesday morning at eight o clock —I did not inform him he was dying and I cautioned the prisoner against letting him know my opinion—I told her twenty hours after the accident that there was not the slightest chance of his recovery—that was after the bleeding—I did not see him take any brandy or any spirits—I did not learn such a thing had been administered till the inquest Cross-examined Q I think you say the treatment you resorted to after seeing him on Sunday morning was under circumstances of entire ignorance on your part as to what he had been doing himself or what he had taken A I thought he had taken nothing but what I ordered him—there was nothing about the wound on Saturday which led me to conclude the result would be fatal—I could not conclude that as was evident from the nature of the wound—the immediate cause of death was inflammation about the internal parts in which he had received the incision—the peritoneum when wounded takes inflammation very soon indeed—a wound externally if sufficient to produce inflammation without the peritoneum being wounded COURT Q It is the character of peritoneum inflammation you say to give a low quick pulse A We understand by the pulse I describe a quick small pulse that is a sort of pulse I should desire a patient to be bled with under those symptoms MR CLARKSON Q It became evident to you on Sunday morning that inflammation had began A Yes and it was the consequence of the wound—it is the nature of the peritoneum when wounded in the slightest degree to be inflamed—in this case it was wounded in two places and even if wounded in only one it is the nature of that membrane to take on inflammation—brandy would certainly have tended to increase the inflammation—drinking would make the difficulty the greater—the prisoner came to my house two or three times on the Sunday—she was in very great affiction and distress and paid him the greatest possible attention COURT Q You would not have thought it judicious and discreet to bleed him if you had not first given him ammonia to raise him A I do not say that I would—it would have been highly injudicious to bleed him when under the shock and fear MR CLARKSON Q Did you apprehend that internal bleeding had followed the wound A I could not discover on dissection that it had COURT Q You opened the body and I ask you was the wound it your judgment the cause of his death A I think so—there was effusions of fluid into the cavity of the chest—not of blood—it is the nature of inflammation for that description of fluid to flow much more than can be taken up and so it remains in the cavity—I have not a doubt the wound was the cause of his death MR CLARKSON Q Did the pulse rise after what he went through in your shop A Decidedly I took about twenty ounces of blood from him besides what he lost from the wound—he only came to me once I was astonished to find him there—many individuals after losing blood to a considerable extent are perfectly capable of walking a considerable distance Q Having received a severe wound on Saturday night and losing twenty ounces of blood should he have gone out in the cold A There would not be any objection COURT Q The considerable effusion you named was not blood but arising from the peritoneal inflammation A Yes that effusion was the cause of his death and that appeared to have been caused by the peritoneal inflammation which was caused by the wound—it was not by the bleeding or any other cause MR CLARKSON Q The wound might have existed and yet inflammation might not have appeared A I do not think it possible—the very process by which it was to be healed would be inflammation—I think if he had had raw spirits or brandy-and-water the inflammation would have been more likely to have a fatal tendency—I did not know of his taking spirits until the inquest PHCEBE DAVIDSON I am single I lived in the same house with the deceased and the prisoner—I had not seen the deceased on the Saturday evening—I occupy the back parlour—Mrs Wilkins occupied the front parlour—I went up stairs at half-past eleven o clock on Saturday night not long after the accident—the prisoner desired me to come up stairs—she said he was hurt and asked me to come up stairs—I went up and found Jenkins in bed—he said he was cutting wood and the knife slipped—I did not see the wound because it was strapped—he said he was more frightened than hurt—I asked him which knife it was done with—he pointed to one on the table—there was no blood on it—this is the knife—I continued with him until nearly three o clock—the prisoner was there all the time—when I left him he appeared better—I went to bed and saw him again at a quarter past five that morning—I had no conversation with him then—he said nothing to me at that time about the prisoner—I remained with him about half an hour—I saw him again at eight o clock—he said nothing to me then—on Sunday afternoon between three and four o clock he asked me if Georgian a had told the people below—he did not say what—I said Yes she had —there was only Mrs Wilkins and her daughter below—when he asked me I said she had—and he said Then she had done for herself —the prisoner was not present—she appeared to have an affection for him and appeared very greatly distressed—he took three-penny worth of brandy at a quarter past five on Sunday morning—I and the prisoner fetched it together but I do not know the quantity—I saw him drink it—I do not know what liquor he had had the night before—he had a glass of brandy-and-water of unadulterated brandy from his mistress—I did not see that but he said it was unadulterated— I was before the Coroner and at Hatton-garden —I saw him return to the house on Sunday morning a little after eight o clock—he had been to Mr Jones—he gave me twopence halfpenny to get him some mustard—he appeared better then in point of strength Cross-examined Q Where did Mr Baggett his master live A At No 26 or 27 Tonbridge-street New-road—I saw him return a little after eight o clock in the morning—he went to bed directly and did not get up again—he went to his master s first and then went to Mr Jones—he said he had been to his master s first—he did not have more brandy when he came home—he had three-penny worth of brandy at five o clock in the morning—he died about half-past six or a quarter to seven on Monday night—he had not been dead a quarter of an hour or ten minutes when the officer came—while he lay ill on Sunday morning he was affectionately attended to by the prisoner—he repeatedly called to her to come to the bed that he might embrace her and entertained the warmest affection towards her—she attended on him till he died—two of us had to push her down stairs to get her from his person MARY WILKINS I lodged on the ground-floor of the same house with the prisoner and the deceased—I had seen him on Saturday evening at eleven o clock before the wound was received—he was in my room before he went up stairs to his own room—the prisoner was with him—they had been out toge ther—I do not know of their drinking any gin—I did not go out with him or see him out of doors—they had not been gone up stairs half-an-hour when I heard a heavy fall—I did not hear any talking before the fall—I cannot tell what the fall was—it fell very heavy and after the fall I heard a load talking—I could not distinguish which voice it was—it did not seem to be quarrelling—I was rocking my baby—the prisoner came down stairs to my door and asked me not to make a noise for she had stabbed Mr Jenkins with a knife—I said Dear me what have you done —she made answer Lend me the nutmeg-grater —she did not say what she wanted it for—I lent her the nutmeg-grater—she told me she would fetch the doctor and she went out to fetch him—she appeared very much agitated and distressed—she said she had fetched the doctor and had the wound dressed—that was after Mr Jones had been there—she had fetched him before she came to me—I did not go up to see him nor have any conversation with her as to how it happened Cross-examined Q Are you in the habit of taking spirits or is it very seldom A I never do take spirits—I had not been to market on this night—the prisoner and the deceased came into my room—I had not been to any wine vaults with her—I recollect the words she said distinctly—she said she had stabbed Jenkins with a knife not that Jenkins had stabbed himself with a knife—I do not recollect using any other words before the Coroner—I am sure I did not say she had stuck him with a knife—what I said before the Coroner was read over to me before I made my mark to it—her words were I have stabbed him with a knife —I did not say stuck before the Coroner—I paid attention to the deposition when it was read over to me—I am sure she said stabbed —she did not say struck —I was not asked before the Coroner if I might not have mistaken the word struck for stuck —he never asked me that question if it was struck and I am quite sure I never used the word

upon half an hour when I heard a loud talking—I could not distinguish voices at all—they were both talking and he more than her as if quarrelling—I heard something very heavy fall on the floor—I thought at the time it must have been a chair or table—I could not say which it was—soon after that I heard her run down stairs and go out—she did not call at our door as she went by—she went out of doom—I heard her return in about ten minutes with Mr Jones—I saw Jenkins again between eleven and twelve o clock on Sunday morning—I heard him go out before I saw him—I went into the room he was in bed—I asked how he was—he said he was very bad—that was the last time I saw him—she had come into our room on Sunday morning and my mother asked her at the same time how she came to do it and she said

with—she goes by the name of Ann Benson —they were in Pedley s room—Benson was quarrelling with the prisoner—Pedley was trying to part them—I was looking into the window and could see them—the room is on the ground-floor—Benson had a poker in her hand and Pedley was trying to part them—he was advising them to go out of the house—the prisoner apparently wanted to hit Benson and she had the poker up to defend herself—Pedley was quarrelling with Potter—I could not hear what words passed—he was not touching him—I did not perceive them strike each other—there were persons collected together looking in at the window—I should think the words between Pedley and Potter continued five or ten minutes—the deceased got Potter and the woman out of the house—they went out themselves—he used no violence—Potter then came into the court and fought with a young man named Carr—they did not strip—Potter did not appear sober—he got Carr into his own passage and Ann Benson too and shut the door—Carr hallooed out For God s sake somebody open the door I shoved the door in myself—I did not see the prisoner as it was dark—Carr went out of the Court and I went after him—I returned into the

was taken away to the hospital—I do not know positively how long it was before he was taken to the hospital—it was about a quarter of an hour that he sat in the chair—the surgeon did not come till after he was gone to the hospital Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q What countryman are you A Irish—one part of the court is inhabited a great deal by Irish and the other is not—I do not know what countryman the prisoner is—I have known him about three weeks just by sight but not to speak to him—I had spoken to him once before this took place—I had a quarrel with him myself about a quarter of an hour before this happened—it was not that quarrel which led me to Pedley s house—after that I went down the court away and when I returned he was in the deceased s room with his girl—I was gone

to look into the deceased s room—I struck him with my hand—I saw nobody near me but the prisoner then—it is not true that I and four or five others followed him up the court to Pedley s house—they might have gone to look in at the window as I did—but what Carr quarrelled with him about I know nothing of—he was thrown down by Carr when he was fighting—he was not knocked down at all—I did not see him down—he might be knocked down before I got to Pedley s without my seeing it because I went down the court—I went to the bottom of the court and waited there—I might have gone out of it it leads

went up stairs with the policeman and saw the prisoner lying on his bed with a woman—I do not know her name—they both had their clothes on—the door of that bed-room was shut—we had to burst that open—I saw the policeman pick up a knife which was on the floor—there were stains of blood on the knife—two knives were found—I only noticed blood on one Cross-examined Q How long had you been there

five minutes walk from Salutation-court—in consequence of hearing a disturbance there I went there—it was twenty minutes after eleven when I left home—I went to Pedley s house—there was nobody but

door and when I saw Potter with a knife in his hand I told him that I saw him with a knife and told him to come in—he did not come in he said the prisoner would not hurt him—I went to go past Pedley and Potter to fetch a policeman—I did not see the prisoner violent or making a noise he only came out with the knife—I told Pedley I would go and fetch a policeman in consequence of hearing Potter say he would stab the first person who came near him—after I said I would go and fetch a policeman he made a blow but whether it was at Pedley or me I don t know—he turned round about three steps to make the blow—I had a basket in my hand and the knife glanced down the side of the basket and scratched my hand a little I have the mark of it now—I had the basket down in my hand and I held it out when I

of it in Broad-street—the persons did not appear to be coming from the court—not above a minute elapsed between my seeing the prisoner with the knife and the blows being struck—he struck one blow which struck me and the other which struck the deceased—the basket was on my side nearest to Pedley—Potter was between us COURT Q Then the side he struck was nearest to Pedley and if the blow had continued without being drawn back it might have gone into Pedley A Yes MR BODKIN Q Did the second blow follow immediately A Immediately as quick as he could lift his arm—I do not believe it mattered who he struck—I believe he would have struck the first person he met COURT Q How far is Pedley s house—are there many houses in the court A Pedley s house is the first house in the court—it is very near the mouth of the court and the prisoner s is next door—Pedley s house is a little room to itself—only one room—it has only one window—there are two turnings before you get into the court without any houses at all—Pedley s house is not more than six or eight feet from the mouth of the court—the turnings are small passages—a person standing in the mouth of the court in Broad-street might hear a disturbance six or eight feet off but it would be impossible to see—when I got there I heard no disturbance at all—I did not see any persons running out of the court and the lame young man following them—Pedley had not lived there a fortnight DANIEL HORROGAN I live in Charles-street Drury-lane I knew both the prisoner and the deceased by sight before—I was standing at the bottom of

stairs afterwards— I had not seen him at the window before that —he had a knife in his hand —I saw part of the blade of the knife—I do not recollect seeing Mrs Cormach there—Pedley was standing about a yard away from where Potter lived at the door in the court—I saw Potter run to him and make a thrust at him—I think he struck him some-where about the belly—Pedley came up the court then and said Mrs Cormack Mrs Cormack my guts are out —I had not observed her—I went to fetch a doctor and when I came back I saw Pedley taken on a shutter to the hospital Cross-examined Q Did you see any thing of any previous quarrel A No I don t recollect seeing him quarrel with Carr—it might have been before I went up the court—I heard of it—no one went up the court with me—I think I saw Connell in the court but I am not certain—I was looking at Pedley at the time the blow was struck—I can t say where Mrs Cormack was for I did not take notice—directly it was done somebody called to me to fetch a doctor and I ran directly—there were a good many persons about—I dare say there were as many as ten COURT Q Did you hear what the deceased was urging in his room was he not urging them to go home A He was

room and found a knife up in the corner of the room all over wet blood and the fat of the entrails was on it at the time—I saw Pedley in the hospital—I saw him after he was dead—he died on Monday the 8th of June at half-past three in the morning Cross-examined Q Did you find any poker A I did not—I did not look for one at Pedley s—I did not search his room—I have been stationed in that neighbourhood about six years—the lower Irish congregate there very much and disturbances very frequently occur COURT Q Were you present at the Middlesex hospital when Mr Laing the magistrate was there A I was on Sunday the 7th of June—the prisoner was present—I took him there—I knew the deceased—I only knew him by the name of Blucher—Mr Laing examined him in my presence and in the presence of

the bowels protruding—the wound was inflict with a cutting instrument such a knife as this would produce the wound if used with great force—I believe the wound in the abdomen was the cause of his death—he died on Monday morning at about half-past three o clock THOMAS GREEN I am servant to Mr Pedley the brother of the deceased—I have heard his brother say his name was Henry—I heard that before his death—I saw him once or twice—I only knew him by his coming once or twice there—I have heard Mr Pedley say That is my brother Henry —I have seen my master and the deceased together and have heard them speak together ROBERT JENKINS I am a police inspector of the E division I was present at the Middlesex hospital when the magistrate took the deposition of the deceased Pedley—I saw him put his

and ran down again with a knife and ran it into me—but whether he intended it for me or the others I do not know Prisoner s Defence written The facts of the case have been very much misrepresented by some of the witnesses—the whole of the provocation I received from Connell and his associates which drove me to a state of frenzy have been kept out of view but that I was provoked almost to madness I think you will feel when you have heard my witnesses—feeling my life in danger I hastily seized the first thing that presented itself and what happened afterwards I cannot state for I was in that excited state but I solemnly declare I was acting under an impression that I was defending myself from violence but not towards the deceased—we were always on the most friendly terms—I trust you will hear Benson s evidence—I deplore that I should have been however innocently the cause of the death of the deceased ANN BENSON I am acquainted with the prisoner On the night in question I was coming home with him about half-past nine o clock—he was very tipsy—I never saw him so drunk—when I entered the court there was a fellow with a crutch Cormack and five or six more—the prisoner had his hand on my shoulder and he happened to touch the fellow with the crutch with his elbow as he passed by and he struck me on the nose with his crutch—I got the prisoner down the court away from them and then

no quarrel that night—Pedley interfered when these men struck me—the prisoner and I were not quarrelling that night—Pedley did not say that the prisoner ought to be ashamed of himself for treating a woman like me in that way—I did not hear him say so—he might say it—the prisoner took up a toasting-fork in Pedley s house and I broke it in halves—I had nothing in my hand but the bit of the

all—Connell struck me first—Horrogan struck me and Thornton took me by the hair of my head—they struck me without any provocation—I know nothing of any previous quarrel the prisoner had with them—I

screams of a woman—I went to see what was the matter—I saw this woman in the middle of the court—I saw nobody strike her but I saw Connell come from her with a sort of satisfaction—she then went in doors to No 2 seemingly into her lodging—I cannot tell what house she lodged in—she went in and fastened the door and stopped there so long I do not know what time she came out—I did not see her

hurry and struck the carpenter again in two or three minutes—he said nothing—the carpenter never returned the blow and said nothing—he was still leaning on his hand and his face was in a gore of blood from fighting and the second blow likewise added to the bleeding—we then all sung out that there should be no more fighting that night and Antonio said No there shall be no more fighting —he went add sat down on his chest and then he stood up and said to the carpenter flourishing and throwing his arms about that he would either fight him that night or kill him—he had nothing in his hand then—he went and sat down again on the chest and we all commenced getting our supper again—Antonio did not eat any thing at all—he had some bread and a bit of cheese in his hand that night but I did not see him eat any thing—shortly after I saw him make a move round the chest and make a motion with his arm towards the side where he used to wear his knife and I saw the reflection of the knife beneath the lamp—I sung out He has got a knife in his hand and at that very instant the carpenter fell down—I saw him stab the carpenter—I saw him plunge the knife close to his body before I could get to him to prevent him or give any assistance—when I Sung out that he had a knife in his hand another man laid hold of him by both arms and said You have stabbled the carpenter —he said No I did not and when he was seized he held his knife up in his right hand and said Take my knife I will not kill him and gave the knife up—the carpenter fell the very instant he was stabbed—to the best of my knowledge there was four or five minutes between the last blow he gave the carpenter with his hand and his stabbing him—Antonio appeared to be in a great passion—he had been in a great deal of passion before but he seemed to be cool after he had the second blow at him—he appeared in a great passion when he was plunging his arms about—that was after the fight was over and before he had struck the second blow at him—he did not appear so when he struck the second blow—he went and sat down and seemed cool Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q How large is the place A Almost like half a moon—about as large as this table—there are twelve berths in the room—also two uprights and chests belonging to the men and a little rigging—there were about ten men in the room—the vessel is about 400 tons burthen—the room is very dark—we always burn a lamp there—there was no room for a table in it—she was an American ship—all the crew were not Americans—there were a good many foreigners—I do not know how many Americans wee in the crew—there were were four or five present at that time—the prisoner is a Portuguese but speaks very good English—any man on board the ship could understand what he said Q Is it considered fair fighting among Americans to get a man s hand in your mouth and bite it A If a man stuck his finger into another man s mouth he would give him a nip—it is not fair to keep a man down after he says he has had enough—after he said he had had enough the carpenter let him go—he asked him twice if he had had enough and then let him go—Antonio Sang out twice Let me up I was examined before the Coroner and what I said was read over—I put my mark to it—I told the Coroner that the crew said there should be no more fighting that night—it was read over to me—he was cooler after the last blow was given Q On your soleman oath did not you swear before the Coroner these words He never appeared to cool at all from the time the first blow was struck but kept cursing and swearing all the time A Yes and I said it was like a flash of lightning—he had nothing in his hand when he was cursing and swearing—he was not severely bitten—he had sore fingers but no bones hurt—he was knocking his hand against the bulk-head and the wood and saying his hand was bit all to pieces—that was after he went to the chest—he was wringing his hand as if in pain and heaving it about—he did not draw his knife till after the cursing and swearing—he was wringing his hands just before he drew the knife and said it was bit all to pieces—it was after the carpenter fell that he said Take my knife I will not kill him —he said Kill or stab I cannot say which COURT Q How long were they down you say they fought at first fairly A The whole of it was between a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes from the begining to the last of it—they had two or three fair blows and then clenched—they were down on a chest—the carpenter was uppermost—it was not long before the prisoner sang out You have bit my fingers carpenter —I cannot be certain whether he said he had bit him or bit his finger—they had not been down long then—they were holding one another and scuffing a little—we did not take much notice—they were not fighting but trying to keep one another down—squeezing and cramming one another—the prisoner s hand was bleeding—it was all bloody—the hand he was wringing about—I could see it when he was flourshing it—the greater part of the crew were Americans—there were a great number of foreigners—I believe in some parts of America it is considered fair when a man is down to bite him or put his eye out—it is so at Kentucky JOHN DAVIS I am a Welchman I was on board The President from New York to England—I knew the prisoner and the carpenter—I was present on the Saturday evening in question—about supper time—the first I observed was the carpenter asked the prisoner how much money he had spent that day—he said 9s —the carpenter held 3s in his hand and was going to bet him he did not spend it for he had not 9s to spend—Antonio said he had and called the carpenter something out of his name—I forget what it was—the carpenter then got up and struck him—that was the first blow between them—they fought for a little white—it was a fair fight—the carpenter had the best of it he asked Antonio if he had had enough and he said Yes —I heard Antonio sing out You villain you are biting my finger —the fight was over then and the carpenter had gone aside—Antonio was just by the scuttle—he then said You have bit my finger Or some thing which I did not exactly notice—the carpenter asked him two or three times whether he had had enough and he said Yes —they were both on their feet Q What was said when he said he had had enough A The carpenter dropped him and went to his supper—they left off—the carpenter went and sat on his chest getting his supper—Antonio was standing between the bits on the scuttle—they were about five feet from one another—Antonio was cursing and swearing by the scuttle—he was in a great passion at that time and said he would fight him next morning or else kill him that night—I cannot say who began the second fight for I did not notice—I saw them giving blows to one another—I was standing on the chest to get out of the way—they both appeared to be in a passion when the second fight began—Antonio was lying on his back on the chest and the carpenter had his hand on him but did not strike him—the carpenter got up and left Antonio and went and leaned his head on his bed-place on his arm—Antonio got up and sat a little while on the chest just the same as if he was considering and then he got up and stabbed the carpenter—he was considering a very little while no time I might say—it might be a minute but I cannot say—the light was very dull but I saw the knife shining in his hand and sung out The villain has got a knife in his hand —and before I spoke the word the carpenter was down—I said You have stabbed the man —he said No I have not stabbed him —I and another man lifted the carpenter up and overhauled his right breast—the prisoner delivered his knife to Taylor who put it in his breast and ran for assistance Q During all this time did the prisoner become cool and calm or continue in a passion all the time A He must be cool when he could sit upon the chest I consider—he appeared cool enough when he went with the knife—I cannot tell any thing about his passion—he had been in a great passion Cross-examined Q Did you not swear before the Coroner that Antonio was in a h—l of a range all the time A Yes—I said that he appeared so at the time they were fighting—I dare say I said the whole of the scene did not altogether take eight minutes but I cannot say exactly—I also said I thought Antonio had not time to cool from the scuffle that he was in a violent passion all the time but I cannot speak property—I do not think I told the captain that the carpenter got Antonio down and laid on him a considerable time but I cannot say—I do not recollect any thing about it—I do not remember saying that on the carpenter throwing himself off him Antonio immediately got up and stabbed him—I will not swear I did not say so—I know Taylor—I do not think I said say thing of the sort to him or in his hearing COURT Q What sort of a blow was it that the carpenter struck the first time at Antonio A I did not notice—it appeared an angry blow when Antonio returned it—I said that the blow the carpenter struck was an angry blow it was so certainly—that was the first blow that was given by any body—I did not notice whether the carpenter was on him when he said Oh you villain you are biting me —I saw them down sometimes Antonio was uppermost and sometimes the carpenter—that was after two or three blows—it lasted no time altogether not more than eight or ten minutes—it was when it was all over and Antonio was getting his supper that he said You villain you bit my fingers —he was standing with his victuals in his hand by the scuttle—I did not hear that while the scuffle was going on—I do not think I ever heard of fighting up and down —I have heard of it in America I believe JOHN WILLIAMS I came from America with Shipley and the prisoner—I remember the Saturday evening—Antonio began the dispute—he said he had spent 10s in the course of the day—the carpenter said he had not and Antonio called him a liar he said he was not a liar—Antonio then called him a lying son of a b— the carpenter then struck him—Antonio returned the blow and they fought—it appeared to be a fair fight—the carpenter had the worst of it—at last Antonio struck him a heavy blow by the side of the face—I saw them clench together they were both standing up—they never were quite down—they were thrown against the bulk-head—the carpenter asked him two or three times if he had got enough and the other answered Yes two or three times—he then let him go and they parted—the carpenter was standing against his berth leaning against it—the prisoner was standing against the bulk-head in the aft part of the forecastle—they were about eight feet apart—I then observed Antonio strike the carpenter again—I saw him go up to him—I did not hear him say any thing—he struck him on the side of his mouth—Antonio said the carpenter had bitten his fingers—I saw his fingers in his mouth before they separated—Antonio was in a passion about his fingers—he was is a passion till he sat down—he sat down for four or five minutes to the best of my recollection—when he was sittting down he was showing his hand and complaining of his fingers—he shook his hand and said Carpenter you have bit my fingers —he appeared to be in pain from it and struck his hand against the bits—that was while he was sitting on the chest—the next I saw was when he got up and ran to him as I thought to strike him but he stabbed him—he had given a blow after they were parted the first time after he said he had had enough—there was no blow after that that I know of out the stab—before he stabbed him he said Carpenter I will fight you or kill you and got off the chest and went to him—I did not observe any thing in his hand—I saw the carpenter fall down on his face—one of the men said He has got his knife out —I caught hold of the prisoner—they said You have stabbed the man —he said No I have not stabbed him —I caught him by the arm and held him—he said to one of the men Take my knife and said he would not stab him Cross-examined Q When he said that was it after the man had fallen from the blow A Yes he was in an agitation about his hand during this—it was after he struck last blow with his fist that he said I will fight you or kill you —the carpenter was standing against his berth where he struck the last blow with his fist—he did not return that blow—he was not able—it staggered him—the prisoner was sitting down just before he used the knife—neither of them were lying down Q He was not lying down on the bulk-head and the carpenter standing by with his hand on him A No COURT Q Did you hear the crew say they should fight no more A Yes several said so after they parted the first time—that was in answer to Antonio s observation that he would either fight him or kill him MR BODKIN Q Did you see Antonio s hand A Yes it had blood on it—I did not examine it—I saw his hand in the carpenter s mouth COURT Q Where was Antonio s hand at the at the time the carpenter asked him if he had had enough A His two fingers were between the carpenter s teeth—I could tell that by his manner of speaking—he had his teeth on Antonio s fingers at the time he asked the question WILLIAM TAYLOR I joined The President here about eleven days before this happened—I was on board when this occurred—we had left off work and at supper-time Antonio came down and said he spent 10s that day—the carpenter said he had not—Antonio said he had—the carpenter told him he was a liar and he had not spent 10s —that was the first time I heard the word liar used—Antonio then said he was a lying son of a b— or something—the carpenter then struck him—that was the first blow that was struck—it was not a very smart blow—I took it to be a light one—the blow was returned and thee was a scuffle between them—the carpenter asked Antonio if he had had enough in a broken kind of voice and he replied yes he had had enough—in a broken way of speaking English he said Me got enough —the carpenter mumbled as if he had something in his mouth—I did not hear him ask more than once if he had got enough—they parted then—Antonio then complained of the carpenter s biting his fingers—I did not notice his fingers at that time—it was rather dark—I did not see him do any thing with his fingers—he said Carpenter G—d d—you you have bit my fingers —he appeared at that time in a passion—he then returned to the carpenter and struck him and they had a second Scrummage—I cannot say where he struck him—it was with his fist—they clenched again had a very short Scrummage and parted again—the carpenter walked back and leaned on his berth—Antonio stood off from him by the ladder as I think and kept complaining about his fingers again saying Carpenter d—you you have bit my fingers —I heard him say several times over By J— carpenter I will fight you to night or kill you —he kept saying it three or four times over—he appeared to me to be in a passion JURY Q Did the expression appear to be produced by the pain of his fingers A Yes—he kept striking his hands against the bits as though he felt the bite which made him angry—I had sat down again to finish my supper and heard them sing out Look here he has stabbed him —I did not see that done—I should think about five or six minutes had elapsed between his complaining of his fingers and the stabbing—I cannot say exactly it was a little more or less—I did not see the stab given—I should think the whole affair took fifteen or twenty minutes Cross-examined Q Did you tell the corner there was very little time between the last blow and the stab A I might say so—we term four or five minutes a very little time—I consider there was four or five minutes between the blow and the stab—the second scrummage followed the last blow—five or six minutes was the whole time from the striking the blow till the stab—the carpenter shoved the prisoner back on the chest in the second scrummage and I believe had him by the throat—he kept him down for a very little while then let him go and they parted COURT Q How long do you think the first scuffle lasted A A minute and a half or two minutes but in that confusion I cannot tell exactly—we cannot tell how time goes in such a confusion CHARLES EVANS I am assistant to a surgeon I was called in to examine the deceased—I saw him between six or seven o clock on Saturday evening and found him dead—I inserted my finger in the wound on the left side of the chest between the fifth and sixth rib and on inspecting the body that wound was found to enter the heart—immediate death would follow on that—a knife was shown to me at the police-office—it had penetrated the right ventricle of the heart—it appeared a wound likely to be occasioned by such an instrument as the knife produced Cross-examined Q How was the carpenter dressed A He had a seaman s dress—a woollen shirt—I did not observe whether he had a waistcoat—the wound as two or three inches deep—I do not know what clothing the man had on—his breast was bare when I saw him—I examined the prisoner s fingers—there was an injury on two of them as if they had been bit or scratched—I should think it would produce very great pain both at the time and afterwards—there would be a sort of reaction to cause very great pain—I did not observe that the fingers were swollen—it would cause numbness and afterwards by reaction the pain would increase Prisoner s Defence written In defending myself from this serious charge I have no contend against overwhelming diffculties But before adverting to those difficulties I would earnestly implore you to banish from your minds all prejudice arising from the character too generally entertained of the dispositions of my countrymen and not allow that feeling at all to bias your decision An Englishman can produce his kindred and friends to prove that his actions have ever been controlled by a kind and humane heart but I stand before you a friendless outcast far from all friends and kindred a stranger in a foreign land and one who but for the humanity of the most worthy Sheriffs would have been here without the means of defence But I feel confident that after hearing the few remarks which I have to offer on the cruel treatment I have received from the deceased you my Lords and Gentlemen will award me justice I commenced my career in the Portugese navy and having faithfully served my country obtained my discharge I then entered the merchant service and having sailed since then on board the shipping of almost every country I about two years since engaged myself in an American ship called the St George of the line of packets sailing between Liverpool and New York I remained in this ship for two voyages and having conducted myself to the satisfaction of my officers I sailed in another American packet called the St Andrew on the same station With her I remained also for two voyages and then unhappily engaged myself to the packet-shop The president Thus you will see that I have conducted myself to the satisfaction of my superiors On Saturday the 16th we knocked off work about six o clock and went into the forcastle to get our supper In about half an hour the deceased and I began to joke as to which had spent the money We continued our joking some time until the deceased became angry and some hard words passed between us He told me that I was a liar and on my answering him that I was no liar he struck me I returned the blow and he fell on his chest I then said I had fought enough and I did not wish to fight again but on rising he turned his sleeves up and began to strike me I returned the blow he caught my hand forced my fingers into his mouth and bit them violently whilst he heat me with the other hand I called to him to let go of my fingers but he still held them fast for some time I called to him again and he then released them but at the same instant suddenly seized me by the throat and pinned me against the side of the forecastle He grasped me with such force that I was almost strangled and called to him several times but in vain to release his hold I urged him again and again to loose his hold but he still held fast and having my ship-knife by my side a knife worn by all seamen on board of American ships I drew it from the sheath and was so overcome with rage and pain that I cannot remember what followed Gentlemen of the Jury since then I have never ceased deeply to lament my conduct and have not had one moment s comfort for I was on friendly terms with the deceased and entertained towards him no feelings of malice or revenge Indeed we had always been the best of friends and none of the crew can regret his death so deeply as I do But Gentlemen do not I beseech you forget that at this time I was suffering the most brutal treatment from him I was pinned against the wall and throttled almost to suffocation my fingers were nearly bitten off my check was dragged till the flesh almost gave way blows were inflicted when I could not defend myself and yet seven or eight of this American crew four of whom are witnesses against me calmly witnessed the scene and refused me their assistance And here I may be allowed to remark that in addition to my other misfortunes I am unable to express myself intelligibly in the English language and therefore liable to be misconstrued or misunderstood Gentleman let each of you imagine himself in the midst of foreigners treated thus brutally and no one offering the least assistance—aching with pain—sinking almost with suffocation—and yet deserted in this dastardly manner by all his shipmates and would there be no palliation if in this moment of passion and suffering you inflicted a fatal wound I solemnly assure you that the witnesses against me have misrepresented the facts and that my statement is true and yet I can produce before you no evidence to support it for though there were other persons present besides those examined they have all left England and returned to America GUILTY of Manslaughter aged 35 — Transported for Life Before Mr Justice Vaughan 
t18370130-594  592 JONATHAN BAILEY was indicted for the wilful murder of Ann Bailey his wife MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution HANNAH CROSS I live with my husband in Thomas-street Grosvenorsquare in the same house with the prisoner and his wife They occupied a shop a parlour behind the shop and a bed-room on the first floor—I live in the first-floor front room over their shop—on the 16th of December between twelve and one o clock in the day the prisoner came home in liquor—he was always intoxicated—I never saw him sober—alter became home that day I beard him and his wife talking together—there was nobody in the parlour but them I believe—he spoke in an angry tone—I did not hear her answer him angrily—it appeared to me that they were quarrelling I could hear hex voice —that continued as much as twenty minutes—after that they were very quiet—after the talking I heard a scuffle and it was after the scuffle they were quiet—about an hour after that the deceased came up stairs into my room—the complained of her head and showed me something on it—it was very much swollen in the middle of her forehead such as would be caused by a blow—I continued to see her from day to day after that—she went about her work as usual—she was obliged to take to her bed on Christmas eve—she had complained of her head every day from the time this happened till then—the first week of her illness I was with her every day three or four times a day—the died on Friday the 6th of January—on the Wednesday week before that she said she considered herself in considerable danger and asked me to recommend her a doctor but I could not—the doctor came the next day—she said on the Wednesday that unless her head was easier the could not possibly live that the pain was so great—she kept saying after that that she was afraid she should not recover—the prisoner continued in the house during her illness—I never heard him say any thing respecting his wife s situation—he frequently went into the room and locked the door that nobody else should come in—I was never in the room with him and never heard him speak to her COURT Q What did the scuffle sound like A Like as if he was poshing her about the place—I heard the trampling of feet and the pushing about of chairs as if they were being jumbled about the room—it lasted about twenty minutes—the talking and jumbling together continued that time—the scuffle lasted about ten minutes—the noise was violent at the time he struck the blow and she came out of the room as quick as she could but I did not see her for an hour—the scuffling was not very violent—I heard it distinctly—I went to listen on the stairs—their door was shut and I did not hear any body else in the room JURY Q Did you hear the female call out A She did not call out loudly she was only speaking to him after he struck her—I did not hear her call out before that only crying from the agony of the blow—that was twenty minutes after it was over—I did not hear any blow struck CHARLES VERRALL I am a surgeon I was called in to see the deceased on Saturday the 31st of December—I found her extremely ill—in a state of very great danger and in the absence of any account of the circumstances I considered her sinking from the effects of fever—she at all times spoke very despondingly but on two occasions expressed herself satisfied she should never recover—that was most particularly on Wednesday the 4th two days before her death—she made use of very strong expressions—she had complained that her husband had come into the room and disturbed her and she said Keep him out of the room and let me die in peace —I think she was then impressed with the notion that she should die and I thought her dying too—the cause having been then related to me I considered she was dying in consequence of inflammation of the brain—I always stated my opinion as to her being in extreme danger in her presence and to her—I did not try to remove her impression of dying nor did I add to it—she seemed to say seriously that she should not recover and particularly on the Wednesday—I had said in her presence that I considered her in great danger and I believe that was her own opinion—she told me she had received a blow from her husband on the forehead—that it was a very violent one and had produced violent pains in her head that it was with the utmost difficulty she had kept about the house for a week—she had taken to her bed a week previous to my seeing her and she had never ceased to have pain in the head from the time the blow was struck—that was all she said to me as to the cause of her illness at any time—she was always consistent in her story—I do not think she made any addition to it—in fact it was all drawn from her in answer to questions I professionally put to her—it was not one uniform narrative—she died early in the morning of the 6th—I examined her body after death—there were marks of violent inflammation of the brain—I found no discolouration of the bone and no external marks of violence at all—I should attribute her death decidedly to inflammation of the brain caused in my opinion by the blow which she stated herself to have received MR PHILLIPS on the prisoner s behalf stated that felt it impossible to struggle against a verdict of manslaughter GUILTY of Manslaughter Transported for Life Before Mr Justice Williams 
t18370403-917  917 JAMES GREENACRE was indicted for the wilful murder of Hannah Brown and SARAH GALE as an accessory after the fact MESSRS ADOLPHUS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution SAMUEL PEGLAR police-constable S 104 On Wednesday the 28th of December I was on duty in Edge ward-road and about ten minutes past two o clock in the afternoon Robert Bond came to me—in conesquence of what he said I went with him to a pathway near the Pine Apple-gate Edgeware-road about eighty yards from it on the side near London—on the left-hand side going from London—I observed a large flag-stone in the path-way—I there found this sack— producing it I found it contained the trunk of a human body without a head and do legs or thighs—I found all these things by the side of it—they are rags and a cord—a part of this cord the arms of the trunk were tied with across-the bag bore the impression of a string or cord on the upper part of it as if it had been tied at the mouth but the string or cord recently cut—me of the rags were lying close to the bag—other pieces were lying by the side of it and other pieces further from it but ail within a foot of the bag—the stone laid with the upper part against the wall and the lower part about thirteen inches from the wall—to the best of my recollection the stone was more than four feet long and rather better than three feet wide—the bag was about a foot from the stone—it was not under the stone when I arrived—the stone laid aslant the upper part of it resting against the wall—I procured a wheelbarrow and carried the bag and its content and the rags to the Paddington poor-house—I examined the bag and observed in it appearances like those of mahogany scrapings such as would be thrown off from a piece of mahogany which had been recently planed—I have seen a steel instrument applied to mahogany after it was planed—they were scrapings—on Monday the 27th of March in consequence of hearing of the apprehension of somebody I accompanied Inspector Feltham to No 1 St Alban s-street Lambeth—I examined the back room on the ground floor and found this child s frock—it is twilled jean—it is patched with nankeen as one of the rags I produce appears to be patched—it is one of the rags I found with the sack JURY Q Is the shade of the nankeen in both the same A The quality is MR CLARKSON Q Does the frock found at the house appear patched in the same manner as the remnant of a frock found at the side of the bag appears to be patched A It does These articles were here handed to the Jury JAMES WHITE On Wednesday the 28th of December I was in Edgeware-road near the Pine Apple-gate—my attention was drawn to a stone there on the left-hand side going from London—it was leaning against wall—I observed a bag there with something in it—it was lying on the ground behind the stone—the sack was corded round three or four times— I do not remember whether the mouth of the sack was corded up—I sent for Pegler of the officer EZEKIEL DICKENS Pegler the officer drew my attention to a stone lying against the wall near the Pine Apple-gate on the 29th of December—I had been to that stone on the 24th at half-past two o clock in the afternoon for the purpose of placing a small piece of wood which the employed on the improvement of the path had dug up—I placed the wood behind the stone—at that tine there was no sack or any thing whatever under that stone MATTHIAS RALPH I am lock-keeper of the Begent t canal and live at Johnson s Lock Stepney On the 6th of January last I believe about half-past eight o clock in the morning I had occasion to abut the gates of the canal and found something impede their shutting—I was called to by a bargeman who told me there was something in the gate—I immediately went with a hitcher—I found the gates would not come to—I put the hitcher down and pulled it along to the middle—I said It is a dead dog case the gate —they eased the gate—I pulled it up and to my surprise I found the head of a human being—as soon as I pulled it from where the gates met the gates joined and then I pulled it straight up—I saw the ear first—that made me know it was the head of a human being—the water was about five feet deep there or it might he five feet three inches—sometimes it is more and sometimes less—when I got the head first to the surface of the water it went down again—the hitcher let go of the hair—it was very long hair—I put the hitcher down again and could not feel it mysef—a man was with me and I said Bob take hold of the hitcher at took it and carefully drawed it along—he said I cannot pull it cut—he gave me the hitcher on the gate—I took it end landed the head the ground—I untied the hitcher from the hair and examined it—the hitcher brought it up by the Bait alone both times—I examined it and food the right eye to be knocked out by a stick or some other weapon—I found the flesh in a perfect state not sodden—the left jaw-bone was broken and penetrated through the skin—the bone itself was through the skin—Iobserved that the left car had been pierced and had had an earring torn through in youth and there was a seam—in the right ear there was a hole which was perfect—in the left ear there was a seam grown up where it had formerly been torn—it appeared thai the slit had grown together again—from its appearance I should suppose the head had been in the water four or five days—I cannot exactly say because sometimes bodies will change in a short time and sometimes not for a long time—I cannot speak nearer than to four or five days—I have frequently picked them out in two days and they have looked worse than others which have been in ten day I did not observe the back of the head—there were no ears—I laid the head down went to my house and fetched a cloth wrapped it and took it to the bone-house and locked the door Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Were you the first person that took head out A Yes and the only person that handled it on the lock—severall others saw it but no one bandied it—the man who was with me said I am done when he was bringing it to the water s edge—he was I believe—he went and cast afterwards and the other one when he took hold of the hitcher said I cannot do it —they were so alarmed—in the lock I have every reason to believe it would have been more freah—the wound—the mark would have been mow fresh—I cannot tell how long it had been in the lock—perhaps three four or five days—I cannot—sometimes we pick bodies out of the canal—I have picked out several and sometimes one that has been in the water three or four days will great deal worse than those which have been in ten days—picked them out when they have been in overnight— the hiccher was here produced —I put the hitcher down and drew it along and drew it up COURT Q By which part A The hook and when I got it to the top of the water it disappeared—it was held by the hair—I scraped for it the second time and when I found it lifted it up—I did not into it—the hitcher was never off the ground—the bottom of boarded in that part—I did not dig after it—I was more particular it up the second time because I did not know at first what I had got MR PRICE Q You say the wound in the eye had not been done the lock because it was not a fresh wound A It would have been more fresh—I did not examine any other wound except that in the jaw that did not appear fresh—not quite fresh—that might have been done the gates bat I cannot say—I cannot say whether that might not have been lone by a stick or iron instrument—I have every reason to gay the wound in the eye could not have been done in the lock or part of the eye would hare been hanging to it—I could not perceive that more than one jaw was broken but I did not examine or perceive any other bruise or mark—I did not overhaul it to feel it as medical assistants would have done—I examined it carefully as far as I did examine it but I did not examine the back part of the head as medical—I examined it as far as I could see for about two minutes—the flesh was perfect—I put my hand to it—it was not like what we pick out of the water when it has been there perhaps a month—not sodden or rotte—the wound on the eye was rather rough—the first parts of the head I saw in the water was the ear and the hair—the head only went down had not much trouble in getting it up—the weight of it was nothing to lift—I wrapped it up in a piece of old sack which I left at the bone-house along with the head wrapped up as I did it—I cannot sty it was coarse or fine sacking—it was a piece I had lying by me—it was a coal-sack or what I cannot say—it was quite sufficient to cover the head—I left the head at the bone-house—I did not delivered to body—I locked the door and returned the key to the grave-digger MR CLARKSON Q You did not examine the back part of the head if I understand you the back part of the head had long hair to it A Yes that would prevent nay observing it JURY Q Could you have broken the jaw-bone with the hitcher A No I am confident the hitcher could have hurt nothing—I perfectly certain I did not injure the head by dragging it up MR PRICE Q Was the head floating A No it was down bottom of the water MR CLARKSON Q Did you afterwards see the head any where else A I saw it in the course of the afternoon at the bone-house—Mr Goulding and one of the police inspectors were present—I cannot say on horseback—there were a great many people there—it was the head I had brought out of the water and which was taken care of by the police JAMES PAGE I am a labouring man On Thursday the 2nd of February I was working at an osier-bed in Cold-harbour-lane between Camberwell and Brixton and found a sack among the bushes—there was a hole in the sack and I saw the part of a knee through the hole—I did not open the sack—a young man who was there pulled it open in my presence—it contained the legs and thighs of a human being—they were taken to the station-house by a policeman whose name I do not know who came there while I was there and they remained there till after the inquest WILLIAM WOODWARD police-constable P 157 I went down to the osier-beds and assisted in carrying the legs from there to the station-house where they remained till after the inquest—I afterwards conveyed them to Paddington police station-house and from thence to the poorhouse at Paddington EVAN DAVIS I am a cabinet-maker and upholster and live at No 45 Bartholomew-close I knew the deceased Hannah Brown for five years last February—shortly before Christmas I heard she was going to be married—about a day before Christmas I was called down from my workshop into the sitting room and saw Mrs Brown there and the male prisoner—he was introduced to me by Mrs Brown as her beau as her intended husband—she was about forty-seven years of age—I think they staid there together about three quarters of an hour at that time—she did not introduce him by any name at that time—the prisoner and I went to the Hand and Shears public-house together and drank—no conversation passed that evening about his intentions—he had a deal to say about America and said he bad a large farm there of 1000 acres of land at Hudson s Bay—he said he had been away from there about four months and that he was going back three weeks after Christmas—after this we went back to my house and had supper together and they left about ten o clock—on Thursday the 22nd of December Greenacre came again to my house I believe it was between six and seven o clock with Mrs Brown—they took something at my house and after that I and the prisoner went to the Queen s Head and French Horn—he was in conversation about America the grand place it was and the rail-loads there and his farm which bo described as a beautiful place—after having a pint of ale he said he was in a hurry to go home to my house we went back there together and supped together at nine o clock—after supper he sat at the right of Mrs Brown and Mrs Brown on his left on the sofa—I sat opposite to him and my wife opposite to her—he said Well we may as well tell you our intentions as we are not children before you and we intend to get married on Sunday morning at St Giles s church and it is agreed that you shall be the man to give her away and your eldest daughter to be the bridesmaid and you being kind enough to offer us dinner on that occasion we shall accept of it —I had offered to do so—we then began to talk about meeting on Sunday morning and it was agreed that we should meet at the Angel public-house near the church at ten o clock—they went away toast a quarter past ten o clock and I walked about a hundred yards with them—from that time I never saw Hannah Brown again alive—on good Friday I saw a head at the Paddington Workhouse-the forehead I observed was flat and the eyebrows straight not so much in a circle as persons generally are—the eye was grey and the two upper teeth were precisely like Mrs Brown s—I did not observe any thing peculiar about the ear for I had never seen her ear when alive Q Did the appearances you observed of the head at the poorhouse correspond with the appearances of Hannah Brown s head in her lifetime A It did in my opinion—I could not swear to it but the appearances of the forehead the eye and the teeth corresponded with her appearance and I believe it to be her head—her eye was grey Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q You accompanied the prison and Mrs Brown part of the way did the make any proposal to you A They told me to be to my time and I said I would Q Did the ask him to step into any houses as you went altar and have something to drink A I do not recollect—I cannot recollect it—I do not recollect her asking lor something to drink more than once and its being rejected by me and the prisoner—it is no use to go and falsehood and I won t do it—she did not say any thing of the sort to at recollection nor any thing that would lead to such a matter MR CLARKSON Q You knew the deceased Hannah Brown five years were her habits those of a temperate sober woman or of a drunken and dissipated one A There was not a more sober woman I believe in London nor a more pleasant and agreeable woman—if I had been pressed to go into two or three public house during the hundred yards I walked with them I should think I should recollect it CATHERINE GLASS My husband is a plasterer and we live in Windmill-street Tottenham-court-road I was acquainted with the deceased Hannah Brown—I remember the 24th of December last Christmas eve very well—she came to my house as near twelve o clock that day as I can recollect—I knew perfectly well that the was about to be married next day for she was to have slept with me—I knew that a week before—it was arranged before that day and on that day also—it had been spoken of several times during the week and on the 24th nine o clock was the hour named for her to come—to the best of my recollection she was not above half an hour with me that Saturday—she had no appearance of black eye or bruise about her face at that time at all—I never saw her again alive—the was a woman of very sober habits—she appeared quite in her usual health and spirits when she left me—I have not seen she head COURT Q Did the come foot to you A Yes—I live very near her—she lived in Union-street Middlesex Hospital Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What are you yourself A I keep a mangle—I had known Hannah Brown nearly two years—I cannot tell how often I saw her—I did not alwaya see her once a week and some times I saw her as often at throe or four times a week—my business kept me very much at home and so did hers—I knew the time for her leaving her lodging in Union-street was not up—she occupied the kitchen below stain MR BODKIN Q Where used you to see her A She sometimes would call on me and sometimes I called on her—I have seen her in the evening as well as morning and at different times—the always appeared a woman of sober habits HANNAH DAVIS I am the wife of Evan Davis I knew the deceased Hannah Brown five years—I saw her last on the 22nd of December—I have seen her in company with the prisoner Greenacre—they came to our house together twice—they said they were going to be married that they were asked at St Giles s church and were to be married on Christmas morning—this was on the 22nd—we were to meet them at a public-house I do not know the name close by St Giles s church—I was to have provided dinner for them—Greenacre said they were going to Hudson s Bay and he would be very glad to see us over there and our family fur there we could have a home and welcome—he represented that he had a great deal of land there—I cannot recollect whether he mentioned how much—it was a good deal and if we came over we could have a home there—I have a daughter—on Christmas eve the 24th became to our house as near as I can recollect boat eleven o clock at night—he asked me if Mrs Brown had been—I said No —he immediately said She said she would not come —he said he thought proper to let me know as I was so kind at to ask them to dine with on the day that the marriage was not to take place in regard that he had made a close investigation with respect to property and found that she had none—he did not add any thing more—I asked him to walk in—he said No and I wished him good night—this conversation took place at the street-door Q Did he say any thing about poverty A He said it would not do for them to plunge into poverty—he seemed very much agitated—I had known Mrs Brown five years last February—line had rather a high forehead and longish features—she had very good teeth short thickish and even—she had a slit in one of her ears—I had observed it—it was an open slit but it had healed each side of the ear and a second place was bored above for the ear-ring—never saw her afterwards—we made a great deal of inquiry about her—I did not go to the workhouse to see the head—her hair was a sort of brown neither dark nor light—it had been light and it was intermixed with grey—she had a fair complexion JURY Q Was it very long hair A Yes—very long—the front was as long as the back—she was a tall fine genteel respectable-looking female Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Have you been intimate with Mrs Brown for the last five years A Most of the time—she was never longer than a few months together without coming to see us—I did not visit her very often—I should think she had lived in Union-street about a year and a half as near as I can say or a year and nine months—she came there from Mr Perring the hatter in the Strand who she had lived with about two years—she was like house-keeper there to Mr Perring—before that lived with Mr Oliver the anchor-maker at Wapping—I cannot exactly say for how long but I should say very nearly twelve months—the last time I saw her she talked of getting a little shop—I think that was September about Bartholomew-fair time—she called in at our house she intended to sell fruit and pastry—she told me where she intended to take it but I cannot now tell the part—there was some widow-lady was going to give up the place—it was near where she herself resided—I do not know Mrs Glass of Windmill-street—I never knew she was an acquaintance of Mrs Brown s—I never heard of her—I was not much acquainted with Mrs Brown s acquaintances—my daughters used to go to her friends with her both of them—Mr Davis s sister lived in a family and that was the way I became acquainted with Mrs Brown—I cannot tell what family it was—it was some where in the City—it was only a short time they were together—that was the origin of ray acquaintance with her—my sister-in-law has been dead three yeaxs the 28th of next June—from two to three months was about the average of Mrs Brown s isiting us and sometimes oftener as it suited her Q When Mrs Brown and Greenacre were at your home on the 22nd of December was there not every appearance of cordiality between them A Yes very much as it should be with persons about to be married—my husband and I were friends of Mrs Brown—we told her to be cautious about going abroad we did not wish to part with her—Mrs Brown told me she had a daughter—she did not speak of her very often—I never saw her—she spoke of her daughter at Norwich and told me she was a straw hatmaker—she did not say whether she was in business for herself—Mrs Brown told me that Greenacre lived at No 2 Carpenter s-place Camberwelltd—I was never there—Mrs Brown invited me there to spend the day there some day after the marriage took place—she said it before Greenacre as well as in his absence and that I was to excuse them not being very nice because they were going away soon to America and it was only a temporary matter—that was in the way of apology for the state of the house—they left our house about ten o clock on the 22nd of December as near as I can recollect—it was as late as ten o clock—they went away together MR ADOLPHUS Q And your husband accompanied them a little why A Yes—Mrs Brown told me she became acquainted with Greenacre through the Wards of Goodge-street Tottenham-court-road—during the five years I knew her there could not be a more sober well-conducted woman—I never saw her child—she mentioned that she had a daughter and that is all I know of it MR PRICE Q Do you know the Wards at all A No I do not ELIZABETH CORNEY I am the wife of John Corney a shoemaker who lives at No 46 Union-street Middlesex Hospital I knew the ietttiti Hannah Brown in her life time—she lodged at No 45 Union-street she occupied the front kitchen—I do not remember the day she came there—she was there a year and a half—she got her living by washing and mangling she had a mangle—I saw her last on the 24th of December—I understood she was going to be married—she had quite sufficient furniture and things for herself—she sold them before the 24th of December—she told me they were not required that Mr Greenacre wished her to sell them for pocket money—she disposed of her mangle—she left the house between the hours of twelve and three o clock on the 24th of December—I observed a hackney coach waiting for her and saw her in it—she took her bores and things with her—I had only seen the prisoner Greenacre on one occasion previous to that—that was a few weeks before—I believe it was him that went away with her in the hackney coach—he and the coachman helped her out with the boxes—I cannot say the hour they went away nearer than between twelve and three o clock—I cannot remember whether I had dined when they went away—the coach had not staid any time—there was a key to the room she occupied—I asked her if she would leave her keys with me or send them to me when the week was up—she went away before her time was quite up—she answered me she would come on the Monday and bring her man with her pay me the rent and give me the keys—that was in the presence of Greenacre—he might have heard it or he might not—he was in the passage and so was she—I cannot say exactly how many boxes or trunks were put into the coach—whether it was three or four—I never saw Mrs Brown again alive—I did not see Greenacre again till I saw him at the police-office—Mrs Brown did not return on the Monday—the keys were sent to me on the Tuesday—her person was in nowise disfigured when she left on the Saturday—she was not wounded but just as usual—there was no injury about her eye—no blows or any thing whatever—on the Tuesday following the Monday on which she was to have come with the keys I received the keys from one of the lodgers—I did not see from whom the lodger received them—I forget the lodger s name Mrs Brown had paid the rent up to the Tuesday before—I have not received the rent up to the following Tuesday—that was part of the object the deceased had then she said the was coming on Monday to pay me—on Friday the 24th of March I saw a head in Paddington poorhouse—I noticed the teeth and the colour of the hair of that head and they corresponded exactly with the teeth and hair of Mrs Brown—I noticed the colour of the eye—it resembled hers Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Were you very intimately acquainted with Mrs Brown A Yes—my husband and I occupied the front parlour next door to her—I was in the habit of seeing her every other day or so—she got her living by washing and mangling—she was very much at home occupied with her business the whole of the day generally—she had nobody to assist her—she generally did all her work self—I have seen the prisoner Greenacre—I do not remember when I first saw him—it was some weeks before he took her away—I believe he came frequently to see her but not being in the same house I did not see him—was not present when be used to come to see her—the lodger s name is Mrs Hawksworth from whom I received the key—Mrs Brown told me that the reason she did not give me the key was she had some few things in the room which did not belong to her—she had a right to occupy room till the Tuesday—there was only one room—she said she should return on Monday and then only to give up the key and pay the rent—did not receive the rent till Wednesday—my husband was the first person who went into the room—he is here—I went in with him and found nothing in the room but an empty birdcage of no value—it belonged to Mr Brown—she had offered it for sale for a trifle—I am quite certain there was nothing else in the room MR CLARKSON Q You did not jive in the house where Mrs Brown resided A No—it was on the Wednesday after the Saturday she left that I received the key from the lodger—any one who had the key could have gone into the room without my knowledge and taken any thing out—while I knew Mrs Brown she was a very sober woman WILLIAM GAY I live in Goodge-street The deceased was my sister—just before her death we were not on friendly terms—I saw her the Thursday before her death at my mistress s shop—I am a broker doing business for a lone woman who keeps a broker s shop No 10 Goodgestreet—it was there I saw my sister on the Thursday—she was alone—I know the prisoner Greenacre—I do not remember haying seen him before Christmas—I saw him on the Tuesday night after Christmas about seven o clock or so—it was candle-light—he came to my mistress s shop—I was not exactly in the shop—I came from the low kitchen—my mistress was it the shop when he came—I heard him speaking to her and telling her the wedding was put off that he had investigated into the character of Mrs Brown his intended wife that was to be and she had no property and he thought that she had by the report that he had heard from some people and by what she had said about taking a shop in London instead of going to America—he said that Mrs Brown had run him in debt at the tallyshop and they had had a few words and were not going to be married after he had said this he said Mrs Brown would not go to tell the people who had provided the dinner that they were not going to be married whereby he said he went I think he said at eleven o clock that Saturday night and told them because she would not go—his expression was they had had a few words—of course be meant on the Saturday night—I never saw him before in my life not know him—he was not acquainted with my mistress—my sister Hannah was acquainted with my mistress from her childhood—my mistress s name is Blanshard—I do not believe that Greenacre knew I was Hannah Brown s brother—I believe my sister never told him—my mistress said to him This is Mrs Brown s brother-wont you walk in —I had come up then and stood and heard them talking said nothing—he said No I am in a hurry and the countenence of the man changed and he walked off saying something which I could not understand—I do not think he stopped two minutes after my mistress said was Mrs Brown s brother Q Do you knew that your sister Mrs Brown had met with accident with one ear A Yes the left ear was torn where it was pierced for the ear-ring—I had heard her say a fellow-servant had torn it is play and the ear was bored higher up—it had healed up but was still perceivable like a cut—I have seen it in that state—I have since seen a head at Paddington workhouse—I looked at the left ear and found a similar appearance there as that I had Noticed in my sister—I noticed the eye in that head and it resembled fiefs—I also noticed the hair—I took a lock of it from the workhouse—it was light hair mixed with grey—her hair corresponded with that I saw at the workhouse—I believe it was my sister s head and no one else s—I told the overseer fit the poorhouse he need not go any farther for that was my sister s head—I never heard of any child of hers at Norwich—there is a sister s child she took to London who was with her for twelve months or two years and she went down to Norwich and got a situation there—she always termed her her daughter—she is now living in Dean-street Soho Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How long had you been dost stairs before you came up and found Greenacre with your mistress A I cannot positilvely say sometimes I am up and down in an hour per haps five or six times—it was dark at that time and I came up as I could not see—I cannot tell how long I had been down all I know it I cum up at the time he was there—I have always given a similar account of to conversation as I have now—I cannot speak for a word—I belief Iii not mention to the Magistrate the conversation about America or taking the shop—I never was at such a place before and perhaps my feelings would not allow me in the agitated state I was in to recollect ever thing particularly Q Have you had any conversation with any person since to refresh your memory as to what took place then A No—only respecting talking to each other—mistress and me—my mistress and I talked abort my sister being absent but not about this conversation which I have stated—I cannot tell how long the man had been in the shop before I came up—I do not suppose above a minute or two—the conversation lasted it might be five or eight minutes after I came up—I cannot swear exactly to the time—I know from my own knowledge that ths child at Norwich was called the child of the deceased—it was my other sister s daughter next to me or I next to her—she is not dead—the deceased termed it her child because she brought it to London in her childhood and she had the care of seeing after it—the deceased never had a child of her own to my knowledge—I often saw my sister though we were at variance Q Have you ever told any body before today a single syllable about the countenance of Greenacre changing when he was told you were her brother A I have told my wife so—that is all—I have had no conversation with any body else about his changing colour—I hold very little conversation with any one—I cannot recollect whether I mentioned it to any one but my wife—to cut it short if you ask me questions I shall not—I hare lived with Mrs Blanshard I believe two years this month I never measured the height of my sister—she was a tall woman—a middle-proportioned woman—not the stoutest nor the thinnest—I cannot tell whether she had a round face or a long face—I cannot say so much about her face about her features—it was not a long face certainly Q How many times had you seen her within six months before Christmas-day Q I had seen her several times but what time I cannot name I did not speak to her when I saw her—I had been at variance with her from about ten weeks after I came to London—I never quarrelled much with her—I have been in London two years this month—she often came to my mistress s house but I never spoke to her all that time—I should think my sister was forty-seven years of age or about that—the was much older than me—I am only guessing at her age—I do not know my own age—it was near the conversation that ray mistress said This is Hannah Brown s brother MR BODKIN Q Do you know whether the child you speak of was brought up to any trade A No—I do not know that—she had been in service MARIA GAY I am the wife of the last witness I knew the deceased Hannah Brown quite well for about seventeen or eighteen years—I should think she could not have had any children—I made observation of such facts which made me think so—she was a tall woman with a very delicate skin and very high chested much more titan most women—and she had a large hand and long fingers—the ear-ring had been torn out of her left ear by her fellow-servant many years ago and that had left a slit in her ear—the part next the face hung a little lower than the hind part—the fond was closed up but still that part hung long—there was a hole bored above its second time—I was not present at any conversation that my husband had with the prisoner in the presence of his mistress—I remember hearing the reports about the body and head being found—my husband made inquiry and he came and told me and I went myself to the Paddington workhouse on the 24th of March—I saw the head which was preserved there and I thought by the time I saw it which was a very small time that I could draw the visage of her down the nose and the features about there—from the very short time I had to look at her it appeared at though I could draw it was the from each side of the nose—she had a very flat nose—her hair was light and intermixed with grey like the hair of the head I saw—I noticed the left ear and it was as my sister-in-law s was Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q How long have been married A About eighteen years—I first saw Mrs Brown at Wyndham in Norfolk—she lived about two miles distant with her mother and father—I have been in London two years this month—my husband was at variance with his sister—I think for about three weeks or a month—they had rather differed—she had been that time with me before we had words—that was about two years ago—after she came to town—she came to live with me the week after in Goodge-street where I live now—she lived with me a very short time—the variance took place while she lived with us—that was the reason we parted—I met her several times afterwards in the street but she never spoke to me—I had a very imperfect view of the head at the time I saw it and will not be positive it was the head of Mrs Brown—I should be sorry to swear to it—I should think I might do it from the view I took of her—it was greatly changed but it appeared at if I could draw the resemblance—her nose was very much flattened and it was then still more flattened—one of the eyes I believe was knocked out—the lower jaw was very much fractured indeed—she had a very nice set of teeth when alive and it appeared to me as if she had but very few in fat of her mouth—but with all those differences of appearances I still thought I could draw a likeness—she certainly had teeth out then and I do not suppose she had a tooth out when I saw her last time—the teeth were very much like hers—she was a tall woman much taller than I am and her skin was delicate—I should not say she was a very weak woman—she earned her bread by very hard labour—a mangle requires power—she continued her daily occupation up to the last time I heard any thing of her to my knowledge—she was a woman of much more power than I am—a somewhat unusually strong woman much more than I am but I should reckon there were many women as strong as her—I cannot tell what strength she had by her look—her work was very hard—it requires more strength than I have to turn a mangle JURY Q Will not constant use enable a person to perform that labour better than one stronger but not accustomed to it A She was stronger than me I know MR PRICE Q You have said she was very high-chested A yes and her hands were very large—I never put her hand against any other—it was a much larger hand than many women have—she was a stronghanded woman I should suppose—I should think the strength lies in the bone and not in the flesh—I never saw her naked—she was flat I call a stout woman not a small woman—she was larger than I am great deal—there are stouter women than she a great deal in the world—her sister is larger than her—she was high-chested—I know she would like to have shown her delicate neck hut she could not being higher than many women are—I should not think that bad any thing to do with strength—I never visited her in Union-street—I was not present when the prisoner called on Mrs Blanshard—my husband came home and told me of the interview between him and Greenacre at his mistress s—I cannot bring the particulars to my recollection—he certainly said Greenacre had been and said his sister had run him into debt in the Strand—but nothing else particular that I can bring much to mind—he did not make any observation on Greenacre or his mistress that I recollect—he merely said he heard Mr Greenacre complain to his mistress that she bad run him into debt in the Strand and he said he thought if she had done it before marriage she would do it afterwards—I recollect those words—I have no particular reason for recollecting them they made no impression on me—it was no more than what I thought would be from what I had learnt and hard of him from my husband s mistress—I thought the man s intentions were not so kind as they ought to be to her—I do not recollect my husband making any observation to me about him—he did not express any thing of the appearance of the parties during the conversation—I am sure at that think I recollect his saying he thought Mr Greenacre seemed in a very agitated mind and state after his mistress stated that ray husband was the brother of Mrs Brown—it seemed to him that it gave the man a great change of his countenance—I am not able to say the time my husband mentioned this to me but to the best of my knowledge it was the same night that Greenacre was at the shop—I saw my husband about half-past nine o clock I think that night Q Did not that communication about Greenacre s agitation make an impression on you when it was mentioned to you A No not the least in the world—I did not remember it just now—it was quite immaterial in estimation at that time—my husband did not make any other observation that I can recollect—he did not tell me why he suffered Greenacre and his mistress to talk to long together without interfering himself in the conversation—I did not ask him that—my husband generally leaves work at nine or half-past nine o clock—I have stated all the conversation that passed that I recollect—I do not know Mrs Glass of Windmill-street—Saturday the first of my having any acquaintance with her—her door is not a minutes walk from mine but I never heard of her before last Saturday SUSAN DILLON I am the wife of John Dillon we now live at No 6 Carpentrer s-place Windmill-lane Camberwell I know both the prisoners—I knew the female prisoner by the name of Greenacre—no other name—Greenacre is my husband s landlord—he lived in the house No 6—the same house we now live in the the prisoner Galo lived there—we were not then living in the same house with then but about twenty-four yards off on the opposite side—I think Greenacre came to live at No 6 sometime in August twelvemonth—I did not see the female prisoner till about the latter end of October twelve month—she came backwards and for wards—whether she lived there I do not know—I remember Christmasday last—it was on a Sunday—I saw the female prisoner on the evening of boxing-day the day after Christmas in Greenacre s gaurd about seven o clock—I cannot say to a minute—she came from Greenacre s door and the child was crying violently after her—I had seen heir every day nearly but I saw her that night in particular—I did not see her come out of the door—I saw her approach from the door in a direction from the house and the child was following her she was in the front garden—it it only a narrow path—it is no street—the child was following her crying—the gardens are in front of the houses and a passage runs through separating the garden of the houses on each side—the houses on each side have gardens in front—this was about seven o clock on boxing night Monday Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How do you know it was boxing evening in particular that you saw the woman and child A Because I went to a particular place I was never at in my life before—I had seen the woman About there many months and had often seen the child—it was in habit of playing with my children—I now tare at No 6 where Greenacre lived—I have not been in the house adjoining Q Is it not possible to hear a conversation if it is loud in the house No 6 taking place in the houses No 7 or No 5 A It is—I cannot say whether the partitions are thin but we can hear persons in each house—if they speak any thing loud at all I could hear what they say—it was very at seven o clock in the evening about Christmas time—the house I lived in is about twenty-four yards from where I live now—my husband a person named Headlands were with me at the time I saw her—my husband is not here—I never knew Gale by any other name than Greenacre—I that was the man s name and I did not know but that she was his wife MR CLARKSON Q Was she known among your neighbours by the name of Grennacre A I do not know—there were many that knew her by no other name—I never spoke to her till I took the house of her and Mr Greenacre which was as near as I can say about the 27th of January I then addressed her by the name of Greenacre and she answered me by that name JURY Q Are you certain it was about seven o clock on boxing-day that you saw Mrs Gale A I am satisfied for I went out to know the time thinking it later than it was—I was going to spend the evening out and it wanted a few minutea to seven o clock—it was very dark and the snow was on the ground—she had not a light—she spoke to the child—their door was open and the light shone from the door I suppose for I saw her and I could see the child from the light from the door and the snow—I could see very well—the door opens into the room—only two houses divided ours from theirs—I was going out at the time and I passed the gate of Greenacre s bouse—I did not observe this from my own house—I was close to her—the child was crying violently at the time—it had no bonnet on—it was a little boy—it was generally very nearly dressed—I never saw a hat on its head to any knowledge—I should think it was about four years old MR PAYNE Q What it the distance from Greenacre s gate up to the house A I should think about twelve yards—from the door of the house to the gate of the garden would be twelve yards I should think—she was inside the gate near the path—the door of the house was wide open at the time—I saw her come from the door—it was kept open till she came close up to the gate CHARLES THATCHER I have prepared copies of plans of the premises in questions for the purpose of doing so I went to Carpenter-place Windmill-lane Camberwell—I believe this is a faithful copy of the plan I hold in my hand—I believe these plan faithfully represent the situation of the houses on that side Carpenter s-place on which No 6 is situated—they are fronted on each aide of the way by strips of gardens—the upper line here denotes she opposite side Nos 11 to 17—the red mark denotes the house No 6—the front door of No 6 opens from the garden into the room—there is no passage—the distance from the door of the front room to the garden gate is thirty six feet three the front room is ten feet eight by ten feet nine—I would beg leave to explain there is a recess underneath the cupboard by the fire on the side which I have not taken into the measure that would make it twelve feet four—it is a glass cupboard but it does not decend to the floor—there is an opening underneath—the cupboard descends to about three feet from the floor—the depth of the recces is one foot six—the distance from the fire-place to the back of the room opposite the window is exactly four feet that is the distance from the fire-place to the division of the back room—there is a passage between the houses on the side and on the other at the end of the gardens—it varies in size and width—I think the average is about three feet seven Q Supposing a table to be opposite the fire-place and a chair on one side of the table where the front door is and another at the side of the door leading to the back room would it be possible from the size of the room to overturn a person in a chair on the floor of the room or would they necessarily come against the wall of the room A It depends on the obliquity of the situation in which they sit Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Did you take this plan yourself A I did—I did not go into either of the adjoining houses—I cannot say whether they are the same size but apparently they are—there is a door opening from the front room into the back room—it descends a step into the back room and lower than the front—the back room is seven feet eight by eight feet a person sitting on the right-head side of the fire-place would have their back towards that room door Q A person sitting on the right of the fire-place in a chair facing the front window if by accident a fall should occur and the back door should be open would they fall headlong down that step A It depends on how they fall—it is possible—I cannot say that it is probable a person on the right-hand of the fire-placewould have their back towards the door of the back room if they sat in an oblique diretion—if she sat facing the fire-place as a person generally does she would have her chair at sight angles—the fire-place is three feet seven from the partition which divides the two rooms COURT Q How far is the side of the door of the back room from the wall where the fire-place is A Four feet—the fire-place projects a very trifle into the room MR PRICE Q I think you do not understand the question A I can give you the exact measurement looking at a memorandum though the plan may not be in proportion the length is three feet seven—the back room of No 6 encroaches a little on the next house No 7—a considerable proportion of that room is within the area of what should be No 7—I think the partition of the front room dividing No 6 front No 7 is four and a half inches thick—the back room from the door to the corner is five feet three Q It appears to me quite impossible that that part of the partition of the back room which divides it from the front room could be any thing like three feet—the larger proportion you will perceive is in the adjoining house No 7 A 0ne foot four only is in the other house—I believe it is not more from the measure I have—the plan may be wrong from the suddenness in which it was done Q What is one foot four A That portion of the room which you may call an encroachment on No 7—the length of the remainder of the partition between the back and front roomis I believe three feet seven—the breadth of the door way is two feet four—the length from the left-hand side of the opening of the back door to the staircase it the front room is two feet six—the width of the opening to the staircase is two feet three—that is narrower by an inch than the opening in the back room—a person sitting on the right hand of the fire-place would have their back towards the back room door Q Then it would be more probable than otheiwise that a chair falling back would throw the sitter with her head backwards through the door and down a step A I cannot say that—towards the opening they would but I cannot say they would come through the door-it is possible a person falling there might fall down that opening—I should apprehend the door was very old and it was thin—it has a very imperfect bad latch to it Q Now whether the door was shut or open was it not such a door if so fastened as that any body say a stout woman falling backwards in a chair against it would burst it open A I cannot say—the door open into the front room and it shuts against the frame hence there would be greater difficulty—I believe it opens into the front room—if it was open if is possible a person might fall through it—any great noise in that house I should think must be heard in either or both the next house—a conversation such as we are now holding might be heard MR CLARKSON Q Then in your judgment a fall with great violence from one room through the door into the other must have been heard by the next door neighbours A I should think it would—I should think the force of the fall would have carried away the door casing against which the door shut in order to fall into the back room as the door opens in wards—that must have carried the door casing away and I should think that could not be done without being heard next door—if the body fell against the door I should think it must carry the casing away for a person to fall into the back room JURY Q Supposing you had been standing in the passage and the door open could you have seen a person in the garden very distinctly at night time A I could have seen them—I cannot say whether I could recognise them MR CLARKSON Q Does not the door open not only inwards into the front room but next to the fire-place A Yes—the hinges are next to the fire-place—I cannot say that I noticed any appearance of the door or panel or casing being broken MR PRICE Q Does not the door if it opens inwards open against the partition and not against the fire-place A It opens towards the fire-place—only the partition divides the two rooms—I never saw the door so exactly open as to say it would fall against the partition but I should think it would—I believe the back room floor is not stone—I rather think it is wood COURT Q We understand you to make the width of the back room seven feet eight A Yes on one side—the distance from the left-hand side to the partition of the front room to be one foot four and from that to where the hinges of the door are three feet seven and the doorway itself two feet four—that makes seven feet three—then there is the side of the door not taken in and that would be about three inches on each side—it is a very old house and there is a difference in the size of almost every portion of the room—there is a copper in the corner of the back kitechen—the privy is in the front of the house at present—it was formerly it the back—it was in the front when I looked at it in the shed MRS DILLON re-examined It was in January I took the house No 6—I know the door leading from the back room to the front—it opens inwards towards the fire-place of the front room—when the door is opens you cannot place a chair in the situation it ought to stand—if I was going to sit by the side of the fire-place I could not if the door was open place it in a proper situation—a table stands in front of the fire and the door opens within about a foot of meeting the table—I am not very stout but I must move the table or chair to pass Q If the door was shut in order to fall from the front room down the step into the back room must you not carry away the casing of the door A Yes—when I sit in a chair to sit down and rock my child without falling I can save myself by the wainscot—when I sit by the fire and the door is shut I can rock my child to sleep with the back of the chair striking against the partition between the two rooms—I fall with my head against it—the back room door has no appearance of being broken at all nor the casing of the door—I never observed it—the floor of the back room is wood—the step is a very little one about seven inches deep MR PRICE Q Will not the back room door open against the wall flat A Yes quite flat by moving it—I cannot say it will come quite close—I have always been in the habit of moving it to pass into the kitchen—I believe it will go quite back flush with the wall—what I call the most convenoient place for a chair is where I can receive the most benefit from the fire Q If two persons choose to sit not on each side of the fire but in front of it of course there will be a considerable degree of space behind then if they have no table in front of the fire A There will—there would not be room for a woman to fall back prostrate on the floor unless she sat quite in front of the fire—if she did she might fall back on the floor—I should not think there is room between the side of the fire and the wall to fall back prostrate for as I sit I can rock my child and fall back against the partition—I sit in a nursing chair and it is lower than any other chair in the room—it has a high back Q If the door was open would it be possible for a person twinging herself back in a chair to fall into the back kitchen A No I should think not—I do not consider she could fall into any place but the front room if she was sitting by the fire—if she sat in any place she ought to sit by the fire aud she would not fall back into the kitchen Q Is there no place where a person sitting in that room might not by possibility fell with part of their person into the back room A Certainly if she tat near the door of the back room she might MR CLARKSON Q When you speak of sitting in front of the fire do you contemplate a table being opposite the fire between the two chairs A No—if the table was in front of the fire and the person sitting so as to be comfortable they could not be thrown into the back room—if she was sitting as she ought to sit with the table in front of the fire she might but not if the table was moved from the firt—it if fold and uncomfortable to sit with the back to the door if it is open I cannot sit with the door open even now Q Then sitting in a chair on either side of the fire-place the table filing its ordinary situation in the room is it at all probable a chair being thrown over she would fall into the back room A I should think she might if the table was where it is now in the room and the back door open the might be thrown into it MR PRICE Q Suppose there is a fire in the back room is there then any inconvenience in having the back room door open A There was no stove in the back room when I took it nor if there now HENRIETTA HEADLANDS I live at No 5 Windmill-lane Camberwell—that is nearly opposite Carpenter s-buildings—I cannot see No 6 carpenter s-place from my house—I known the female prisoner Gale perfectly well—I saw her in the neighbourhood about Christmas last—the last time I saw her before Christmas-day was on Christmas-eve—that was on Saturday from half-past ten to half-past eleven o clock io the morning—I cannot speak nearer—she was it the garden of the house No 6 Carpenter-buildings standing carelessly at another person might be—I had known her some considerable time before—I may venture to say near upon twelve months—I did not speak to her—the door of the house was open—I never knew her except as Mrs Greenacre until very lately Q Have you ever addressed her by that name A I have never had consversation with her except Good meaning it is a fine day —she always passed by that name—I saw her no more that day—I saw her next on boxing day Monday—I was in Mrs Dillon s company and her husband also on Monday and saw her from a quarter to seven o clock till a quarter after in the evening—it was quite dark—she was coming in a direction from Mr Greenacre s door down the garden—I am quite sure it was her —her little boy was screaming violently—she came in a direction from Mr Greenacre s door and the door was wide open and a great reflection of light passed from the house on to the garden—I noticed that she had a bonnet on carelessly—she took the child up in her arms and the words the repeated were You naughty cross child —I saw no more of her—I pasted on—I saw her again on the Wednesday following in the garden of the same house—I did not see Greenacre then—it was before dinner between ten and eleven o clock in the morning—nothing whatever passed between us—I did not see her there on any day that week at the same time as Greenacre—I can undertake to say I have seen them there together both before and after Christmas at the house—on the Friday week before Christmas I saw them both together—she had a dark common print on when I saw her in the garden on the Wednesday—she had no bonnet on * Wednesday—she was dressed as a person would be it places where they lived—I remember seeing Greenacre carrying a blue merino bag in the Christmas week—it was after the Wednesday—it might be Saturday but when I cannot say—I mean the week after Christmas day—he came down Carpenter s-place before me and went into the house we call his No 6—they usually lived in the front room down staira—I noticed the shutters of that room being shut in the week after Christmas day for three Off four mornings—they were shut at the time I saw Greenacre carrying this bag—I cannot say whether the shutter were shut on either of the occasions that I saw Gale there—this was a common merino bag such as most tradesmen as most tradesmen are in the habit of carrying—it might be a little larger than this one looking at one as the table and of a different colour—it was blue—when he got to the house with the bag he took the key with his right hand from his pocket and unlocked the door—he had the bag in his left hand—he let himself in—he took the key out from the front and went in and shut the door after him—I did not see him come out—this was either Friday or Saturday sit Christmas day—it was in the Christmas week—after this the house was to be let—I went to the house with Mrs Dillon to look at it—I cannot exactly say how soon after but imagine it might be three weeks after Christmas—the house was fumigated from the top to the bottom with brimstone—it smelt as if it had been so—the prisoner Gale was in it and her little boy—the fireplace was barricadoed up in the front room except a small space—I thought I should not be able to put coals on the fire unless it was removed though there was a fire in the room at the time—I could not see the hobs nor any part but the front of the fire—the boards came up as high as the chimney-piece—the boards reached from the hob to the mantel piece—not from the ground—Mrs Gale had every appearance of living there then and in fact she said she was Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Are you married or single A Single and live at No 5 Windmill-lane—I knew Mr Greenacre and Mrs Gale as neighbours—I never had any conversation more that good morning and good evening—I had lived in Carpenter s-buildings previous to my living in Windmill-lane with Mrs Dillon—at that time Mrs Dillon lived at No 9 Carpenter s-place on one side—Mrs Dillon and I were intimate acquaintances—I was living at her house—I went to look at the house No 6 to take it for her and for me to be a lodger with her—I should consider that I stopped in the house from twelve minutes to a quarter of an hour—I went up stairs into the front and back rooms—they were furnished—there was a bed in each room and chairs and boxes and the house smelt of brimstone—Mrs Dillon made no observation about that—I made an observation to her immediately I came out but not before—I asked her if she smelt it for I was coughing violently from the perfume—I have seen fire boards but never saw one fitted in exactly as this was—there was a moderate fire as poor people usually keep—the screen was wood I believe but I was not near it—it was not burnt because there was a place cut out as if it was meant to replenish the fire—I did not know Mrs Gale s name farther than calling her Mrs Greenacre merely because she lived in Mr Greenacre s house and I always understood she passed as Mr Greenacre s wife—there was a bill in the window for the house to let—the gate of the garden is generally shut—I cannot say whether there is a fastening to it—I believe there is a simple fastening—children play about there—I cannot say I ever saw them in the gardens not in Mr Greenacre s garden—there was only his own child and I suppose he did not like to be annoyed by other people s children—the garden was not in a dilapidated state—I consider Mr Greenacre s was in the best situation—he had taken a great deal of pains with it—I saw it this morning—it is now in a dilapidated state—I was in the house this morning with Mrs Dillon—I saw Mr Dillon there—we hare not been talking of this business at all—I have mentioned it because I went for Mrs Dillon to come here—that is all I said about it—I had only a passing acquaintance with Mrs Gale—that is all—we never had a few words together—the fire-place was barricadoed as I never saw one before with the fire in it—what I mean is I that there were boards before the fire—I thought it probable that the fire-place might smoke—the place smelt full of brimstone FRANCES ANDREWS I am the wife of Joseph Andrews a shoemaker I lived at No 11 Carpenter s-place till a fortnight last Saturday—I lived there for some time last Christmas that is on the opposite side to No 6—I had lived there twelve months on the 14th of last December—I know the two prisoners—I knew the woman by the name of Mrs Gale all the tine I was there—I had not known her before—our side of the way is better supplied with water than theirs—there is none on their side—our water is laid on—I was living in friendship with Mrs Gale getting my living by shoe-binding—she used frequently to come to my house for water and sometimes I have fetched her when I have found the water was on—I remember her coming the week before Christmas—before the 18th—it was not on a Saturday—it was one day in that week—she came for water—I could not supply her at that moment—she did not call on me after that for water—she did not come to me for any thing after that only on Sunday the 18th she came and asked me to lend her an iron—on that day I saw a female go to her house in the afternoon—she was rather broadish across the shoulders and rather darkish—I saw her in the afternoon in the garden and after that I saw her go in-doors—I saw her before the shutters were shut but not afterwards—she had a pea-green gown on and a cap on—I did not see her is a bonnet—I did not see her go there but only saw her when she came out—she was rather stout and broadish across the shoulders—I rather think her gown was silk but I was not near enough to know—she was not a short woman—before that Mrs Gale had said to me if I had any water she was going to wash a pair of sheets as she had got a visitor coming—I cannot say what day that was—it was before the 18th—she said the was coming to stop two or three days—I asked her whose visitor she was—she said Mr Greenacre s —she said she was to sleep with her—I cannot say whether the woman who came on sunday the 18th went away at all—I never saw her afterwards—I saw Mrs Gale afterwards in the course of the week before Christmas day—I saw her little boy in the course of the week—nothing passed between us—I saw her on boxing day—I did not see her the day before Christmas day to my knowledge the day after Christmas day I did—I observed nothing particular about the appearance of the house on Christmas day—I saw the shutters shut but that was not unusual if they went out—the shutters were shut on Christmas day—I noticed them in the morning but did not notice after—she had not been to me for water on the Saturday to my knowledge—I did not see her at all on Christmas day—on the following day I went over and saw Mrs Gale but nobody else—I cannot say what time it was—it was before dinner—it was boxing day—the windows were a little way open but not entirely—I taw Mrs Gale—I took the little boy a bit of plum-pudding—I did not see the boy nor Greenacre—I saw Mrs Gale—I said I thought you were out yesterday by the shutters —she said No I was not —that Mr Greenacre was gone out to dine where her boy was but she was not inclined to go—I told her I thought she was out by the shutters being shut—we had this conversation in the house—I afterwards went to her about water I think on the Wednesday—the water was coming on—I had thawed my water—I went over knocked at the door and it was opened to me—Mr Greenacre was striking a light—he opened the door—I did not speak to him—I said Mrs Gale the water is on if you wish to have any —Mrs Gale was there as well as Mr Greenacre—she was putting some wood into the grate—I was coming back again and Mr Greenacre called me back again and gave me some whiskey—Mrs Gale was present all that time—this was Wednesday after Christmas day the 28th of December—in the course of that morning Gale came to my house and asked me to let George stop with us as she was going out a little way—that was her little boy—I do not know the time—I told her I would let him stop and be frequently came and stopped—she left some bacon and bread for him while he was there—I never heard any more about the visitor—Mrs Gale came back for the boy in the evening some time after dark—when she got him I cannot tell whether she went over to Mr Greenacre or not—I left that place about a fortnight last Saturday Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q In that Christmas week were there persons occupying the houses on each side that in which Greenacre lived A Yes and they are occupied now by the same persons—Mrs Folt and Mrs Brigden lived on each side—I did lot know where Gale lived during the latter part of that Christmas week—I did not know she was absent from there—I do not know where she lived from the Thursday before Christmas—I never saw her sleep there at all—one of the persons who occupied the house on one side of her is outside now waiting—I have not seen the other—I am positive that the conversation I have spoken of as occurring on boxing day about Mrs Gale being at home on Christmas day related to Christmas day THOMAS CLISSOLD I live at No 1 Pitt-street Camberwell and am a shoemaker I know the prisoners at the bar—I became acquainted with them on moving their goods about a week after Christmas—I happened to be going down Bowyer-lane at that time—Greenacre was an entire stranger to me—it was between nine and ten o clock in the morning—as I went down Bowyer-lane Mr Greenacre met me at the top of the saw tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I wanted a job—I told him yes—we went up Windmill-lane and before we got to the top of lane we met a boy—he asked him if he would come to assist—the boy said yes and we both went to the top of the court and there we found a truck at the top of Carpenter s-court down Carpenter s-place—he put the boy in possession of the truck to mind it while he and I went down to the house No 6—when I got there I found every thing was packed up boxes bedsteads and bedding all packed up—I think there were three boxes—I am sure there were three—Greenacre helped me out with the large box which was the first a little to the end of the garden—I then put it on my shoulders and carried it to the truck—I fetched two more afterwards and put them on the truck—then the bed and bedstead and two or three chairs—Greenacre assisted me to tie part of the things into the truck—at this time I thought he Greenacre trembled exceedingly—he was very much agitated at the time he was assisting me to tie the things in the truck—after the things were tied up he said Now I am going to leave the country all is right —the woman Gale was by the side of him—when he made that observation Gale exclaimed Ah you have done for yourself —I and the boy went on with the truck to the last turning before you come to the Elephant and Castle at the left-hand side along the Walworth-road—the two prisoners accompanied me—Greenacre on one side of the pavement and the woman on the other—I and the boy were in the road—there is a turning on the left-hand side just by the Elephant and Castle—when we got there Greenacre said he would dispense with our services and he was going to part with part of his furniture there—the boxes he said he should take himself to the Docks and the truck he should bring back himself—we had then missed the woman—we had lost sight of her by York-street in the Walworth-road and I never saw her spin till she was in custody—he did not say where he had disposed of or sold part of his furniture—there is a kind of picture shop where we stopped where they sell pamphlets—he did not go into that shop before he said he would dispense with our services—he gave me 3d at first and the boy 2d but after some cavilling as I was dissatisfied he gave me 6d and the boy 3d —this was in the Christmas week Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Were you out of work at that time A Yes—I am not out of work now—two policemen called on me to attend here—my first examination was at Union-Hall—they called on me because there was a quarrel between two women in the street and one went and gave information to the police that I helped to move the goods—I had nothing at all to do with the women—it was the mother of the boy who helped me who was quarrelling—I do not know where that boy is—he is not here to day—I have seen him since—he came to Marylebone but he was not bound over—I know nothing about him now no more than he is a neighbour living very near where I live—he may be here to day if he is called on—I was walking carelessly down Bowyer-lane and Greenacre came out of Windmill-lane—he tapped me on the shoulder and said Do you want a job and I said Yes —I did not observe any agitation when he tapped me on the shoulder—the woman walked on one side the pavement and the man on the other and I and to boy in the middle of the road—when I had done the job I quarreled about payment—he paid the money—I did not perceive any great agitation then—he seemed to be in a great hurry—the agitation was not so violent as to keep him from wishing to save his money COURT Q Is there not a furniture shop broker s shop close by the place where the truck was set down A Yes—where old furniture is bought and sold THOMAS HIGGINS I worked for a mangle maker of the name of Ward I know this sack—I know it by the string of my apron—sometimes I wanted a string to tie a sack of shavings and sometimes I was short of a bit of cord and I took the string of my apron and tied it to the sack—here is the string of my apron in it now—I remember using that string with the sack—I should know the sack without the string but I know it better by the string and I know it by the holes in it which I used to cut with the chisel—the sack does not belong to roe but to my employer—I said I could make use of it in taking shavings out to sell—I used it sometimes once a-week and sometimes twice a-week for the space of two years constantly—there are holes made in it by my child—here is one but it is torn now—here is another which was cut with my teeth when I could not get a small chisel to put into it—I made the holes to put the string through to tie the sack shavings up with—there is nothing more by which I can remember it—the sack was kept down in the manger of Mr Ward s premises in a stable—I go through that to go to the workshop—persons coming to the shop must come into that stable before they come up stairs into the shop—I know the prisoner Greenacre—I have seen him come to Mr Ward s whose premises are in Chenies-mews Chenies-street Bedford-square—I have seen Greenacre go up stairs to the workshop—a fortnight before Christmas day I used this sack—in the Christmas week I wanted it and found it was gone—I do not know the day—I looked for it but could not find it—I had put it into the manger when I had done with it a fortnight before—I took no notice of it afterwards—I asked Mr Ward where the sack was—that was at the time when I first missed it—I wanted it to sell some shavings in—I cannot tell what day it was that I spoke to Mr Ward about proposing to take out the shavings—it was in Christmas week—I noticed Greenacre at Mr Ward s premises the week before Christmas day—Mr Ward has now gone away—I do not know where he is gone to—I see no shavings in the sack now—I used to carry shavings of beech in the sack and some times birch and sometimes African mahogany shavings—the shaving is not caused by the plane—we generally use a scraper to fine wood and plane the coarse wood—I used to sell the shavings of beech and mahogany—I call it all shavings whether produced by a plane or a scraper—that produced by a scraper is the finest of shavings—it is very thin scrapings very fine—they are sold merely to burn—I sell the shavings to a baker to burn Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Let me see the sack are there any marks about it of pots and kettles A I never knew any in it—Mr Ward is a mangle-maker—he was an acquaintance of Mrs Brown s—I think he had known her for a length of time—I cannot say how long—I have known her for four years visiting Mr Ward backwards and forwards long before any thing was known of the prisoner—it was not her that brought the prisoner to Mr Ward—Mr Ward I believe recommended him to the deceased—Ward did not tell the prisoner in my presence that he was going to America but Ward himself told me so—I do not know whether he is gone there—I never saw the sack in Mrs Brown s possession—I cannot tell whether Mr Ward gave it her to remove her pots and kettles in from Carpenter s-place Q Was Mrs Brown in the habit of getting shavings constantly from Ward A When we had a boy we used to tend shavings up to Unionstreet I usually sent them in sacks—I cannot say that this sack was ever there for that purpose at any time—I never took her any shavings in sacks—this sack sight have gone to her with shavings but it always came back again MR BODKIN Q When you sent out shavings was the sack always brought back A Brought back always HENRY WIGNAL I live at No 56 Portland-street Walworth I know the prisoner Gale—I know both the prisoners—Mrs Gale came to lodge it my house on the 22nd of December—she took the buck parlour unfurnished—my wife was there when she came in—she slept at out house that night—I first saw the prisoner Greenacre at our house the text morning about nine o clock—that was the 23rd—he brought a bundle with him—I was at work at the time—I saw him there on Saturday the 24th in the morning—on the evening of Saturday Gale was out—the came home about half-past nine or ten o clock—I cannot tell what time she went out—she slept there that night—the next day Christmas day Greenacre came to our house between one and two o clock in the day it was Sunday—Gale was then at home—they dined together—they went out in the evening but whether they went out both together I cannot say—it was towards the evening that they went out—I cannot say the time—Greenacre was at my house during the Christmas week—he slept at my place two nights the 31st of December and the 1st of January and moved on the next morning—the 1st of January was Sunday—on the 1st of January I was in my own room up stairs reading the newspaper—he was in Mrs Gale s apartment—I was reading the newspaper that morning to my wife and a friend of mine and my sister—I read of the trunk of a body being found in the Edgeware-road Q Did you read loud enough for the prisoners to hear you A They must have heard me read it—they had the door of their room ajar and must have heard me—they staid there all day and slept there all night—they did not say a word about this trunk that was found Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Mrs Gale came to you on Thursday the 22nd of December A Yes—she did not sleep in the home every night—she slept out of the house on the 26th of December which was boxing-night—that was the first night she slept out after she came to live with us—on the Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday she slept at our house—they went out on Christmas day in the evening—I cannot recollect when she returned but I should say as near as I can guess about six or seven o clock—I dare say they might have stopped out an hour—I almost forget—very likely Mrs Wignal may know something about this—I know we were not out all day only in the morning—Gale was not out very long—the slept in the house that night—we are very regular early people in our house—Mrs Gale was a very quiet well-disposed person—I cannot say that I observed any alteration in her appearance or manner from beginning to end—we did not entirely approve of Mr Greenacre coming to our house at all—that and her stopping out on boxing-night occasioned on giving her notice to quit altogether—boxing-night was the night after Christmas day—it was a particularly cold sleet and inclement night—Greenacre dined in Mrs Gale s apartment on Christmas day—I was not in the room when the dinner was cooked—he came between one and two o clock to the best of my recollection—we dined ourselves about one o clock—upon my word I cannot recollect whether he came before or after our dinner—Mrs Gale went out to buy something for dinner—I believe it was part of a scrag of mutton according to what my wife tells me but I did not see it COURT Q You mentioned boxing-night and then again you named the 31st of December and 1st of January was Mrs Gale there during the whole of that week you say she left on boxing-night A She slept out on boxing-night—I let her in about seven or eight o clock the following morning and gave her warning to quit for stopping out and leaving the child in-doors all night—whether she went out again that day I cannot say but the following Thursday she came up and paid me my rent and then went down stairs and took her child and was out all day and all night and came home on Friday—I did not let her in myself on Friday SARAH WIGNAL I am the wife of Henry Wignal The female prisoner came to lodge with us on Thursday the 22nd of last December—I myself let the lodgings to her—she described herself as a widow woman—she did not give me her name—I know the male prisoner Greenacre—he moved her in that evening—she came into the apartment in the daytime and between six and seven o clock in the evening he helped her to move in with another man with a horse and cart—she slept in the house that night—die next day the male prisoner brought a sort of a bundle it appeared in the shape of a quartern loaf and appeared one—she slept at our lodgings that Friday night—on Saturday the 24th of December Greenacre came again in the evening—I cannot exactly say at what time—it was towards evening—on Christmas day Greenacre dined with her—on the following day which would be boxing-day Gale went out in the evening—I cannot exactly say the time it was between six and seven o clock or it might be eight o clock—she had a little boy Q What was done with the little boy A She took the boy with her Q Did she come home that night A Yes Q What on boxing-night A No she did not come home on boxing-night Q Was the child left behind or did she take it with her on boxing-night A Yes she took it with her—no I beg your pardon she locked the child up in the room—she put it to bed between six and seven o clock and locked the door when she went away she did not come home that night nor till between seven and eight o clock the next morning—on her coming home I gave her notice to quit—she was to leave that day week—on the following Thursday she came up and paid the rent and took her little boy away with her that morning at nine o clock and did not come back again any more till the next morning—I do not remember any thing about new year s day—Greenacre slept there two or three nights during the time she was at my house in her room—she left for good on the Monday morning—Greenacre slept with her on the Sunday night as she moved on Monday morning—Greenacre took her goods away for her when she left Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q The notice to quit proceeded from you I believe A Yes—the woman did not leave of her own accord—I was dissatisfied with her stopping out all night and with Greenacre being there—when I gave her notice to quit Mr Greenacre came and fetched her away—she was in the habit of dining at home every day—she used to go out occasionally to get things in—she slept at home every night until Monday boxing-day—she always conducted herself as a quiet orderly peaceable woman—she was a woman living very abstemiously and sparingly —she bad a small dinner on Christmas day—it was boiled turnips and a scrag of mutton about one or two pounds with her child—that was all her dinner—Greenacre dined with her that day—he came at dinner-time and dined with her—I cannot say positively whether she went out at all on Christmas day in the evening—Greenacre came between twelve and one o clock or it might be two o clock about the time we were getting our dinner ready—between one and two o clock—Greenacre stopped all the afternoon I believe till about nine o clock or between nine and ten o clock then he went away alone leaving Gale in our house where she slept that night—I cannot say whether Gale left the house at all after Greenacre came there on Christmas day—I cannot say whether she did or did not—I have no recollection on the subject—I was at home all day—one or the other was there the whole of that day—I cannot say whether Mrs Gale left the house in the course of that evening or not—I do not think she went out at all Q Supposing she had left the house then Greenacre would have been left behind A I do not think she went out at all MR CLARKSON Q Whether she left with Greenacre or without him or at all you cannot say A No—I knew her only eleven days—she represented herself as a widow—she slept out the fourth night that she came and he slept with her two or three nights Q It that what you mean by being a peaceable orderly woman A She was a person we did not approve of—there were two pounds of a neck of mutton and turnips between her and Greenacre—I cannot say exactly—there might be a pound or a couple of pounds—there was but a very little bit—on the evening of that day Greenacre left about nine or ten o clock—I cannot say whether Gale went with him COURT Q What was the age of the child A Three or four years—it was a boy—on boxing-night the child was left at home when she went out—I did not see it in bed but heard the child crying Mother about eight o clock after she was gone and several times during the night the child cried out Mother JURY Q The child on the evening of boxing-day slept at home at your house you have no doubt A Yes on boxing night I know it did because the child sung out Mother in the morning the moment she came in it the door COURT Q What time did Mrs Gale go out on boxing-night A Between six and seven o clock in the evening after putting the child to bed—I do not recollect whether she had been out before that with the child—I do not know where Carpenter s-buildings is myself JOSEPH KNOWLES I am a pawnbroker and live in Bolingbroke-row Wilworth I produce some articles which were pledged at my shop on the 17th of January—I took them in myself of a female—I have seen the female prisoner before and have every reason to believe her to be the person I took them in of—I believe her to be the person—she gave me the name of Mary Stevens 9 East-lane Walworth —I believe I have seen her before but I have no recollection of her having been a customer—I produce a pair of shoes two veils and a handkerchief—they were wrapped up in an old silk handkerchief—I have got that handkerchief—I examined it after the inspector called to see it—in folding it up I perceived several stains of what I think to be blood on it—these holes in it appear to me to burnt—they are where the stains are which I conceive to be blood Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How much did you advance on these things altogether A 2s —they are worth about that sum—then is something among them worth nothing at all—the marks are where the holes are in some part of the handkerchief—those marks are on the hand kerchief now—any body that has got eyes can see them GEORGE FELTHAM I am an inspector of the T division of police On Saturday 25th of March I received a warrant for the apprehension of Greenacre and proceeded with it to the neighbourhood of Kennington—I went to Carpenter s-place to make inquiry and on the Sunday I went with the warrant to No 1 St Albanstreet—I got there about half past ten or a quarter to eleven o clock at night—the door was opened by the landlord of the house—in consequence of what he told me I went to the parlour door which just inside the street door—I knocked at the door and called Greenacre —a voice from within said Yes what do you want —it turned out to be Greenacre—I said I want to speak with you open the door —he said Wait a bit while I get the tinder-box and get a light —I did not wait—I heard him moving in the room as if he had just got out of bed—I lifted the latch of the door and it not being fastened I went in—the root was dark—I found him standing in the room—the door fell back towards his elbows—he was standing in his shirt in the room—I laid hold of him by the arm and he said What do you want —I said I have a warrant to take you into custody for the wilful murder of Hannah Brown —by this time a light was brought from down stairs by the laid-lord—when the light was brought I read the warrant to him or partly so—I then said Do you know a person of the name of Brown —I said Do you know Hannah Brown —he said No I know no Hannah Brown —I said Were you never asked in church to a person of that name —he said Yes I was —he was then putting on his stockings—I said Where is she now —he said I don t know and you have no right to ask me those questions —I said I don t mean to ask you any more questions and I caution you what you say to me for whatever you do say to me I shall be obliged to repeat elsewhere —I then searched his trowsers which laid on a box by the side of the bed—I had not noticed Gale at that moment—just about the time I took the trowsers off the box I saw the woman Gale in bed in the room while I was in the act of taking out of his pockets whatever might be in them—I said What woman if thay —he said Why that is a woman that comes to sleep with me —I said She must get up alto and dress and go with me —as I was speaking thus I saw or rather heard the rattling of something in her hand like a watch and I said What is that you have in your hand let me see it and she handed me this watch—I put my hand towards the bed and she handed me the watch—in so doing I saw that she had two rings on her finger and I took them off at the same time—she then got out of bed and dressed herself—I then turned my attention to Greenacre s trowsers pocket from which I took this pinchbeck watch in a leather bag—he had this purse with one sovereign in it and a cornelian stone and there was a half-crown loose in his pocket—the cornelian stone bears a crest and the initials J G as it appears to me—I also found this bunch of keys eight in number a spectacle-case and a pencil-case—Gale got up and dressed herself—she had put on her pocket and I said Stop what have you got in your pocket I took from her pocket these two duplicates these two ear-drops which are cornelian set in gold 2s 5d in money and these keys—one duplicate is dated 17th January 1837 for two veils a handkerchief and a pair of shoes pawned at Mr Knowles s 19 Boling broke-row Walworth in the name of Mary Stevens—the other duplicate is for a pair of shoes pawned on the 9th of April 1830 for 1s 6d —I found a third duplicate in this pocket-book which I took from Greenacre s coatpocket—it is for two silk gowns pawned on the 6th of February 1837 for 14s At Franklin s late Harrison Tottenham-court-road in the name of William Green—after they both had dressed I sent for a coach and as they were both coming away the female prisoner said Oh there is my child in the next room —I said Child — Yes said she I cannot go without my child and the male prisoner requested to have a great coat out of a box which was corded—I at first refused to open the box for it—he seemed anxious for it and I uncorded it and gave him the coat—I did not bring the boxes away then—a coach came and we got into the coach together—I locked the rooms and took the keys with me and drove to Paddington station-house—before we left the lodging after he was dressed and had put on his great coat and while the child was being dressed he said it was lucky I had come when I had for he should have been on the quay to morrow for he was going off to-morrow morning at nine o clock—he did not say where he was going—I went to the lodging again at six o clock next morning having kept the key the whole time—I started from Paddington at six o clock that morning and went to the lodging—I unlocked the boxes which I found in the room—four of them were locked and corded—one which stood by the side of the bed was not locked nor corded—the bed was on the floor not on a bedstead—I unlocked the several boxes and took out such articles as I thought probably belonged to the deceased and among them was this boa and this silk cloak—they were both wrapped together in a bundle—this shawl and this white dress I also found and this saw I found in one of the corded boxes—there were many other things but I only took what I thought material—I did not find any thing else then—I could not stop longer—I went again on the Tuesday the day following in company with the friends of the deceased her own brother Mrs Davis her sister-in-law and three or four persons witnesses who have been here—I then unlocked the boxes and found some articles—this handkerchief was in one of the boxes and this collar laid on a recess with some glasses by the side of the fire-place and this handkerchief I found in one of the boxes—it appears to have a stain of blood on it—it is a handkerchief which females wear on the neck and this small crape shawl I also found which was identified—in the back room which the male prisoner said was the female s room on the night of their apprehension I found in a box this box of cards and another box with some bits of ribbon and trivial things in it—I also found a trunk in the same room—it is a wooden trunk covered with paper—there are some pieces of huckaback in it—I should say some of the things are new and some have been used—on the Tuesday in the box which stood by the side of the bed I found this pistol in a till at the end of the box the box was not locked and the ball was in it—it has a percussion lock—I also found this French knife in the same box and across the box laid this stick—it was too long to lay along and it laid corner ways—it is a sword-stick—found some bullets which had been very recently made and were made very roughly—that was all I found—I brought nothing else away at that time—I have fetched the whole of the property away since that and it has been lodged in the station-house—the things I found were produced to the friends of the deceased at the next examination and they pronounced their opinions on them—they have been in my care ever since unaltered and untouched by any body— producing them Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q You received a warrant to apprehend the prisoner it was obtained on your own application was it not A It was—I am not aware that I have ever given a different account of this transaction—I am quite sure the expression I used when I entered his room was I am come to apprehend you for the wilful murder of Hannah Brown —I should not think I said I am come to apprehend you on suspicion of a murder —I have never said that I did say so—I am sure of that—quite sure—I never said that to any person whatever on any occasion that I am aware of—I do not think I could have said so—if any person should say so they would be mistaken—my words were distinctly For the wilful murder of Hannah Brown —I read the warrant to him—I turned my head when I first saw the female—I heard the watch rattle—she had it apparently in her hand and I heard the trinkets rattle against the watch—it was a silver watch and appendages—I demanded it and she gate it up—this is the small pinchbeck watch that I took from the male prisoner s trowsers which he put on and wore to the station-house—there are some stains on this blue handkerchief apparently like blood—they appear to me to be so—I cannot say they are like any other stains—it appears as if blood had been on and wiped off—they are the colour of blood—it is a crimson colour—as though blood had been on it and wiped off with a silk handkerchief a cotton one or something else—the stain is not exactly crimson—it is that sort of stain blood would leave—I do not know that a gooseberry tart would leave such a stain—I will not undertake to swear what the stains are—I thought they were blood when I first saw them and I still retain that is pression—they appear to me the sort of stains that blood would leave—port wine might leave such a stain—I got this paper box out of the back room called the woman s room—there was another box in that room—that is at the station-house—I have kept the articles I received from the women separate from those I received from the man—I believe the huckaback was in one of the corded boxes—these two small boxes were in the wooden box covered with paper—the other was not empty but that was nothing in it which the deceased s friends thought material—there was some children s wearing apparel in it and a woman s gown—it was nearly full I believe—the contents of that box are now in another box—I have kept them separate so as to distinguish them Q Now after having been to St Alban s-place did you go back again to Camberwell A Yes and I searched the house in the absence of the prisoners at Carpenter s-place—I had been to Carpenter s-place before but not to enter the house before—I did not get information that the man had gone to St Alban s-place from any body at the house—one of these watches has been identified as the property of the deceased—that is the pinchbeck—I am not aware of the value of that—it is a common rather oldfashioned watch—the pistol I have produced has no powder in it now—I had—I cannot tell what quantity there was in it when I found it for I took off the cap and put it into my pocket—when I first examined it I perceived there was powder in it—that was when I got to the station I discovered a small quantity in it then—I should say one third of a charge—it is a percussion lock—I did not examine my pocket to see if there was any powder there—there was not a full charge in the pistol certainly when I examined it MR ADOLPHUS Q Have you in the course of your life seen stains of blood on silk or linen A I have these stains appeared to me to be blood when I first saw them and I am of the same opinion still—I am rather of that opinion—I have seen stains of fruit and port wine and many things—on silk and linen—I should think I could tell the stain of port wine on silk of that colour—I searched the house at Carpenter s-place when I went again—I did not find or bring any thing away from there—I looked at the room and shape of the place—my first object in going was expecting I should find some stains of blood or something—I went to examine the house—I should not think that taking the percussion cap off would enable the powder to escape from the pistol because the cock was down—whether it had been actually full I cannot tell MR PRICE Q Were there other carpenter s tools there besides the saw A There was a coarser saw and other carpenter s tools but they are not here—I did not think it right to bring them COURT Q Did you find in some of the boxes several other carpenter s tools A I did—I could bring them to-morrow if they are wanted REBECCA SMITH I live with my husband James Smith at Wyndham in Norfolk The deceased Hannah Brown was a sister of mine—her maiden name was Hannah Gay—I know this paper trunk— looking at it —I knew it in my sister s possession—I believe this card-box was hers—I saw it last October two years—my sister was then living at Mr Perring s and I was stopping there a fortnight with her and the card-box stood on the table in her room where I slept with her and I saw her use it of a morning when she put her things on— looking at Mary Ann Bale —I know that young girl—she is the daughter of my sister Sarah Gay—whose name is Bale now—that girl has been living in Norfolk latterly—my sister Hannah used to call her herdaughter—she stood god-mother for her—the girl s father died nineteen years ago—he was killed on the 9th of February—the was very young then—her mother was in the family way and she left about a month after her father was killed—this girl was always noticed and called as Mrs Brown s child—she has since been in service—I never heard of my sister Hannah having a daughter or any one she called her daughter except that one—I never heard of her having a child of her own Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Had you ever seen the trunk before you came to London to your sister A Yes—at different times—I speak to it by a particular mark and some work that is in it—it was seen with some waxend—it was broken by the luggage being on it when she came down into the country and we put it together with some waxend and plastered it together with paste—I have seen that box and examined it within the Iast fortnight— looking at it —I know it by the hinges and this part here—it was done four years ago last Michaelmas—I saw it at the place the policeman took me to and examined it there minutely—I have never expressed any ill-will against the prisoner—I never saw the man but twice Q Now with respect to your niece where does your sister live whose daughter she is A I cannot say the name of the place but it is within eight miles of Yarmouth—I cannot say how long the girl had been with her aunt Hannah because I was not in London—I have not been in London since last October two years—she lived with her mother a good while and she went to service—my sister Hannah was then in London—the girl was at service at Wyndham—I do not know how long she was with my sister after she was up here—I know nothing about that—the girl was always in service HANNAH DAVIS JUN I am the daughter of Mr and Mrs Davis who have been examined I knew Mrs Hannah Brown—I was to have been bridesmaid at her intended marriage—she had such a shawl as this— looking at it —I think she had it on the last time she was at our home on Thursday evening the 22nd of December—she had such a boa as this—I do not remember whether she had one on that night—she used to wear it in general when she came to our house—I saw her in it a short time be fore Christmas—she had such a collar as this—of this pattern—I know the pattern of the work—I remember that—I do not remember whether she had that on on the 22nd—I have seen her wear it often and generally when she came to our house—she had such a white gown as this—it is made of jaconet muslin—this is the way it was made—she wore it when she used to go with us to Gravesend—I have seen her several times in it—she had a white veil but I cannot swear to this—this black veil is like hers—she had a black lace veil like this—it was dotted exactly like this and there was a tear in it which is here—it has been mended—that enables me to recollect it distinctly Q Now did you after the marriage had gone off at any time go to Paddington workhouse A I went on Good Friday and saw the head of a female there—it resembled that of Mrs Brown s—the hair was like hers in colour and the eye was like hers—I had seen her frequently in life—I believe it to be the head of Mrs Brown Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q That is a very common boa I believe is it not A No I do not think it is—it is a good one of the sort there are different qualities—there is nothing uncommon in it—she had one like it—I never saw but one collar like this and she used to wear that repeatedly at our house—I had known Mrs Brown for five years—I believe she was a healthy strong woman—she was tall and stout and of a vigorous frame—she was a very hard-working woman—I remember her living at Mr Perring s the hatter—I do not remember seeing that covered box among her things but I did not take particular notice of her boxes—I have seen her several times at her house—I slept with her once in Union-street and I visited her very frequently Q Did it not occur to you as extraordinary that you heard nothing more of the marriage A Mr Greenacre came and said it was put off—I had no curiosity to know any thing about the reason of its being put off—I did not see him my mother saw him—I made an attempt to find Mrs Brown—I went once to Mrs Blanshard in Goodge-street Tottenham-coot road where her brother lived—I only went once to inquire after her myself—we thought that she was ashamed to come on account of her great disappointment in not being married—I do not know Mrs Giass of Windmill-street—I never heard Mrs Brown speak of her—I knew some of Mrs Brown s friends and acquaintances—I knew Mrs Blanshard and Mrs Ellener—Mrs Blanshard was intimate with her—I have not seen them much together but I believed them very intimate—her brother lived as servant to Mrs Blanshard—I did not know they were at variance—I had heard they had had a few words but did not know exactly that they were at variance then—I did not know that they did not associate—I heard nothing of that from Mrs Brown herself—I have heard her talk of it but did not know they were it variance at that—I do not know how Mrs Brown came to visit Mrs Blanshard and not her brother—I have been to Mrs Blanshard s with her—I do not think her brother was in town when I went there—I went to tea there once before he came to town Q When you read the account in the papers of a person missing did—it never occur to you that it might be Mrs Brown A No—I first learnt that Mrs Brown was missing on the Sunday before Easter Sunday from the brother who went in search after her at Camber well SARAH ULLATHORNE I am the wife of Thomas Ullathorne a baker in the Strand I knew the deceased Hannah Brown from a child—I knew her well and intimately we lived close to one another in the country before we came to London and we kept up our intimacy all our lives—she used to visit me up to Christmas last looking at the cloak —I have seen her wear a cloak like this about once—it seems the make and like the cloak the had on at that time for I looked at it particularly when she came to my house—it is a black silk cloak—it might be five weeks or a month before Christmas that she called on me with it on—it was the last time I saw her I think—I have seen her wear a shawl like this many times and have seen her wear this boa or one like it frequently—this black veil is also like one I have seen her wear Q Now taking all these things together if they were found in a room or any where should you pronounce them to be Mrs Brown s property A I should the shawl particularly but not the other things so much—the shawl I had particularly noticed because I wanted one like it but could not get one—I cannot speak to the boxes—she was staying with me at one time which enabled me to notice her things Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Is there any thing particular about that cloak or is it a common black silk cloak A I should not particularly know the cloak—I should know the shawl if I saw it any where else—it is a particular pattern which I never saw before—if I had seen it twenty miles off in the country quite unconnected with Mrs Brown I should have thought it was the same pattern—I do not speak with any confidence to the boa—the shawl is the only thing I can speak to with confidence—my intimacy with Mrs Brown continued up to within about the last month of her death—I saw her perhaps once a fortnight or week Q As you yourself got up in the world did your acquaintance with her discontinue A No I was on the same terms of intimacy with her as I was before—I never made any difference—she mostly visited me—I did not visit her in Union-street—she was a strong hearty woman—she got her living by keeping a mangle MARY PAINE I am the eldest sister of the deceased Hannah Brown—this Pinchbeck watch was my sister s—I have had it in my possession for three or four months together—I cannot be positive to these ear-drops—she had some very nearly like them CATHERINE GLASS re-examined I have seen this cloak—Mrs Brown had one exactly like it—I had not seen it very often—I noticed the make of it because she showed it to me and asked me how I liked it—I examined it on her—it corresponds exactly with the one she showed me—I have seen her wear a boa exactly like this and she had a shawl exactly like this—I have seen it very often—I remember the pattern—I have often noticed it—it is exactly like the shawl she wore Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q It appears to be an ordinary cloak is it not A Yes very commonly worn about the street—I last saw her in it a fortnight before Christmas at my house—I have seen her wear it at her own house—she usually dressed very respectably—the boa was not a recent purchase—the cloak I believe she had recently—I know she had not had it long—I cannot tell how long she had the boa I believe as long as I have known her—I cannot exactly say I know the white dress—I know she had one but cannot say whether that is it or not—I never visited Mrs Brown except at my own house—we have gone out together—I did not know any of her friends—I knew her nearly two years but never knew any of her acquaintance—she never slept at my home before—she told me she should sleep with me on Saturday night because all her own goods were out of her own apartment—she told me she had been to Mr Greenacre s—she has called on me when she has been going there—she never said she was going to stop there—she was a stout strong muscular woman MR BODKIN Q Did she say any thing to you about Mr Greenacre inquiring about her property A No—she told me whatever her goods sold for she was to have for herself because Mr Greenacre did not want any money he had got plenty MRS DAVIS re-examined Mrs Brown had a collar like this and she has been I dare say dozens of times to my house with such a collar—I had noticed the pattern and work of it and directly I saw this collar I knew it—I saw it at Lambeth at the house where it was found—I accompanied the officer there—Mrs Brown had a boa like this but I do not know any particular mark on it—I know she had cornelian drops but cannot say these are them—they are like them as far as I can see EVAN DAVIS re-examined I remember that Hannah Brown had similar ear-drops to these but I cannot say they are the same WILLIAM TAYLOR I am parish-clerk of St Giles-in-the-Fields I produce a book of the publication of banns—I find the banns of marriage between James Greenacre and Hannah Brown published the first time on the 27th of November the second time on the 4th of December and the third time on the 11th of December—they were completely out-asked before Christmas—I officiated and know they were published by the minister—I entered them in the book banded it to the minister and he published them ELIZABETH CORNEY re-examined by MR PRICE Q On the evening of Mrs Brown leaving your house do you remember her packing up her things A Yes—I am not aware that she had any kettles or any thing of that kind—I believe she sold every one of them—I have only a belief of that—I never saw this piece of sacking till I saw it in the policeman s possession—I do not believe she had that sack among her things when she went away—I never saw it—I did not observe the things she carried away very attentively—I do not know that she carried away any cooking things—I do not believe she did MICHAEL CARROL BROWN I am a police-sergeant On Sunday the 26th of March I was at the station-house at Paddington on duty and the two prisoners were brought into my custody by Feltham about half-past eleven o clock at night—about ten minutes after Greenacre was brought in Feltham read the charge to him and I put the prisoners into separate cells—there were no other prisoners with either—Greenacre was visited by me about twenty-five minutes after twelve o clock in his cell—I found him lying on his back with this silk handkerchief tied into a noose round his right foot and the other part of the handkerchief tied round his neck—I first cut this part off his neck and then I cut the other—he was stiff and apparently dead—Mr Girdwood came and bled him in five or seven minutes and he recovered in about three hours—the first word I heard him say as I was in the act of putting his foot on the fender by the wish of Mr Girdwood was I don t thank you for what you have done—I wish to die—d the man that is afraid to die—I am not Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Were you examined before the Magistrate about this A No I was in attendance to be examined and was not called—Mr Girdwood Feltham and a police-inspector were present when this conversation occurred—I did not make a memorandum of the words—I have mentioned the words over several times since—I have talked about it to many people—I do not know whether I have done so to my brother policemen—perhaps I have but I cannot charge my memory—I might have done so—I am quite clear that I am correct in the words I have mentioned THOMAS TRINGHAM police-constable T 187 I was in the cell with Greenacre at the police-office at High street on Saturday morning the 1st of April—he began talking first about people coming in to look at him—he said This affair has caused a great deal of excitement more I believe than any that has transpired in London or the country for some time —he said Many people run away with the idea that this was moved in a cart —I said What you mean the body —he said Yes but it was not it was moved in a cab —I said Was it on the same night that the affair happened that it was removed — MR PRICE Q Had you said any thing to him before this conversation took place A I cautioned him before it began not to have any convenation with me as perhaps I might name it—I said nothing else—he did not send for me—I was placed in the cell with him after the occurrence and he began to talk to me voluntarily MR CLARKSON Q You said Was it on the same night that the affair happened what said he A He said No it was not it was in the morning —I said The morning of the same night — No he said on the Monday morning I believe —I said Was it after daylight —he said no be believed it was between the hours of two and five—he then said There is a great deal of mystery about the head—they have run away with the idea that it was thrown over the tunnel at Maida-hill and they don t know to the contrary—there is no proof to the contrary—but I don t want to satisfy the minds of public curiosity —I repeatedly in the course of the conversation cautioned him not to talk to me so much—he said As for what I say to you is nothing —he then began asking me if I knew whether a person was coming forward whose name I do not recollect Captain some-body—he did not say a Captain of what—I said I don t know —he said he had been informed that he was— Well if he does he said I will provide myself with some questions to ask him —he then commenced writing—after he had been writing some time he read over some sentences of that he had been writing—questions he intended to ask this captain—it was about a ship that this captain took to America with a cargo of goods—he did not name what goods but he sold them and defrauded his creditors—he said he had also sold the ship and cheated the owners and came back and returned it as a total wreck—he asked me repeatedly while he was writing if I had got a knife to cut his pencil—I said I had not—he asked me several times for a knife Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q When did this conversation occur A On Saturday morning previous to the second examination—I found him very freely communicative—I am quite certain he said the body was removed between two and five o clock in the morning MATTHIAS RALPH re-examined I conveyed the head I found in the lock to the bone-house—I locked the bone-house up and gave the key to the gravedigger s wife at his own houses—I believe her name is Sarah Matthews— looking at her —that is her—I left the head in the bone-house in exactly the same state as it came out of the water wrapped up in what I carried it SARAH MATTHEWS I am the gravedigger s wife I received the key of the bone-house from Ralph on the Friday—I delivered it to James Barrett the same day—I kept it till I gave it to him—I did not let any body in in the meantime JAMES BARRETT I am a bricklayer I received the key of the bone-house from Mrs Matthews and went there with it—I saw Mr Birtwistle the surgeon there—he saw the head that was in the bone-house—I opened the door and let him in—several people went in at the time I went in because I could not keep them out—they went in at the same time I did on my opening the door—I went a good many times that morning to get the boards out—no one went with me—strange people came in and looked at the head but nobody interfered with it at all—they did not touch it—I let Mr Birtwistle in about the middle of the day and several more gentlemen went in at the same time Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When you went for the boards did you take them off to another part of the burial-ground A I locked the door when I took the boards out—I did not go away and leave the strange people in the bone-house—I took the boards outside and locked the door after me and had the key in my pocket—I took all the set of boards out at one time—I suppose I went six or seven times before I went with Mr Birtwstle and every time I came out I locked the door JAMES FELL I am clerk at the public office Marylebone I attended the examination concerning the two prisoners—I have a statement here which was made by the prisoner Greenacre—nothing was said by the Magistrate or any person by way of promise or threat to induce him to make that statement—it was his own voluntary statement—I took it down—I did not read it over to him at that time—I did afterwards at a subsequent examination—he then acknowledged it and signed it—the female prisoner also made a statement in her behalf—I read it over to her and she signed it—she very well understood what it was—these are the statements— read The prisoner Greenacre says There have been many direct falsehoods given—the key I have had twenty years—I did not tell her brother that we had had words—I told him distinctly that we had no words on the subject—I questioned her about the property and I found that she was a loose woman—she had put up two silk gowns to me at a tally-shop—there had been duplicity on both sides—there are many coinciding circumstances that may perhaps cost me ray life—one of the witnesses has stated that I helped her to move her boxes on Saturday that is true—I had this female lodging in a room and she washed and cooked for me—I gave her notice to leave previous to Mrs Brown s coming home and she left—Mrs Brown came down to my house on Saturday night—she was rather fresh from drinking in the morning—in treating the coachman she had made herself fresh—then at night being Christmas eve she insisted on having some rum and had a great deal to her tea—I thought that a favourable opportunity to press her for a statement of her circumstances and she seemed reluctant to give me any answer and I told her that she had often dropped insinuations in my hearing about hating property to go into business and she had said that she could command 300l or 400l at any time—I told her I had made some inquiry relative to her character and I had ascertained that she had been to Mr Smith s in Long Acre a tally-shop to endeavour to procure silk gowns in my name—when I put those questions to her she pat on a feigned laugh and retaliated by saying she thought I was deceiving her by misrepresenting the extent of my own property—during this conversation she was reeling backwards and forwards in her chair which was on the swing and as I am determined to adhere strictly to the truth I must say that I pot my foot to the chair—it was just after we had concluded tea and she went back with great violence against a chump of wood that I had been using of and that alarmed me very much—I went round the table and took her by the hand and kept shaking her and she appeared entirely gone—as it regarded my own feelings it is impossible for me to give any thing like a description from the agitation I was in at the time—during this state of excitement I deliberated and came to the determination of concealing her death is the manner it has been already laid before the world—I thought I might be more safe that way than if I gave an alarm of what had occurred because if I had I thought I might be considered her murderer—no other individual had the least knowledge of what I have now stated—this female who is here I perfectly exonerate—she was away from the house—this took place in Carpenter s-buildings Camberwell—some days afterwards when I had put away the body I called on this woman and solicited her to return to her apartment Again—as regards her things and her trunks I told this woman that as she had left them there we would pledge them—the whole of them fetched about 3l —I do not knew any thing more that I have got to say—she had eleven sovereigns and two or three shillings—that is a true statement of the facts—It was Christmas eve it happened—we had tea about seven or eight o clock and it was that evening I called on Mrs Davis to stop their going to church—there was no quarrel at all The prisoner Gale says I have nothing to say—I know nothing about it—I was not at Camberwell at that time—those two rings that was taken from me one of them I gave 5s 6d for in the City twelve months ago and the other my little boy who was digging in the garden found with a half sovereign two half-crowns and a five-shilling piece and sixpennyworth of halfpence—the ear-drops have been my own for this seven or eight yean—in regard to the shoes Mrs Andrews gave me the ticket and the other ticket I found in the street near our own house—Mr Greenacre told me I must leave hit house a fortnight before Christmas but I could not suit myself with lodgings till the Wednesday or Thursday following—I returned back on Monday-week following the Thursday—he said the correspondence was broken off between him and Mrs Brown and he wished me to come back again—That is all I have to say The prisoner Gale says nothing MR JOHN BIRTWISTLE I am a surgeon residing in Mile-end road On the 6th of January I saw a human head at Stepney Churchyard which was afterwards removed to Mile-end workhouse—it had been drawn from the canal—when I saw it—in the dead-house I partly examined it but not KELLY Mayor minutely—I examined it enough to know that it was in the same unaltered condition when I examined it more particularly on the following day the 7th—it had not been altered in the least—when I examined it on the 7th in our workhouse I found it had received a blow in the right eye that the coats of the eye were ruptured and the humours consequently let out——round the eye was ecchymosisy which means the pouring out of the blood from the rupture of a vessel—that effect was produced when the body was alive—that is my opinion—the appearance of it was what I should call tremendous black eye—the face was cut in various places—this appear ance of the eye was caused before death—that is my opinion—after death 1 think a blow on the eye will not produce that effect Q Was the eye totally displaced or did it remain void of its humours A It remained void of its humours—there were several lacerations on the face—one a sort of crescent-like laceration on the cheek and a contort wound on the lower jaw—the crescent-like wound I conceive was pro duced by incision—the one on the lower jaw by being jammed—both the lower jaws were fractured—my opinion is all the wounds I have described except on the eye were inflicted after death—on the top of the head there was a bruise also which had occurred after death—I did not observe any other wound on the head at the time I am speaking of which was at our workhouse on the 7th of January—I examined the neck at the dead-house and found the body of the fifth cervical vertebra had been sawn through and disarticulated at the transverse processes—that is it had been disjointed about five of the bones of the neck down Q Would such a saw as the one produced effect the severance of the head in the manner you have described A I think it would—I have seen this saw since applied to the two bones and it fits exactly—I kept the head in our dead-house until night and had the key of it my self—I then went over with the policeman and it was removed to my house which is opposite the workhouse—I then packed it in a small hamper myself tied it up and put my own seal upon it and gave it to two policemen a sergeant of the K division and a common policeman—it was taken from my house that night to Paddington workhouse—I saw it again there about half-past ten o clock next morning—the hamper was then as I had left it with my seal untouched—I then examined the bead more carefully in company with Mr Gird wood—I was present when be ex amined it and appearances were then made obvious which were not appa rent before—the right ear had a notch in it—I think it was the right ear—the head is here—we examined the wounds which I have described and came to the conclusion that the wounds I have said were inflicted after death were so and that the other the eye was inflicted before death—we then proceeded to open the head—there was a wound on the back part of the head—I could perceive that on opening it—there was no bruise on the outside—it was an effusion of blood—there was no bruise on the outside but an internal wound which I could only discover by opening the head—it was between the integuments and the skull Q Were you able to judge whether that wound had been inflicted before or after death A I think from its appearance it had been inflicted before death—I cannot say whether it had any necessary union or concurrence with the blow in the eye but I should think if a blow was struck in the eye and the back part of the head came in contact with any thing it would produce it—I applied the head to the body that was at the workhouse and the one fitted the other exactly—it appeared tome that he throat had been cut—the head was perfectly bloodless—all the blood was perfectly exhausted—I had nothing to do with the body but the bead was entirely free from blood—the were entirely free from blood—I do nut think that effect likely to have been produced if the throat had been cut after the subject was dead Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q How long after death will the blood flow 10 as to empty the vessels of the blood—how long after sudden death A It would depend entirely on the cause of death—I think if a person died from the effect of lightning the blood would flow some time after death—I cannot say as to the case of a broken neck—I never witnessed a case—blood will flow while the body is warm—I should think in to case of killing by a contused blow or bruise or any internal injury proceeding from a blow or fall that warmth would remain in the body for an hour or two Q Daring that time would the body be capable of ecchymosis a perfect body A I have never made any of those experiments and therefore cannot speak decidedly on them—there are gentlemen here who can but I am not prepared to enter into these matters—I am a member of the College of Surgeons—I was admitted in 1827—I have examined many bodies recently after death but not immediately after death—I have had no opportunity—Mr Girdwood attended the examination with me—I think him a gentleman of great experience—I mean by a bruise any thing that has contused the part—there cannot be contusion on a living body I think with—I out blood being on the surface of the skin—nor immediately after death also—there is a distinction between the words bruise and contusion—it appears to me that there is—I think in a contused wound you would not find the same appearance as in a bruise—a contusion may not produce blood on the surface but a bruise always produces blood on the surface—a bruise always produces ecchymosis—the neck was not ex amined internally by me—I was not present at every examination—it has been examined many times since—the first examination by myself was on the 7th of January and the second examination was on the 8th by myself Mr Girdwood and others at the Paddington workhouse—I was present the whole time with Mr Girdwood—on that occasion the neck was not opened—the part cut was examined—that is the anterior part of that portion of the neck which had been divided from the trunk—the cervical column was taken out by disarticulating it from the head—Mr Girdwood art down upon the first vertebra—he introduced the knife through the flesh—he then cut the neck down—he took the bones out entirely and left the toft parts—he then cut down the neck from the first vertebra to the remainder of the fifth in front and behind—he removed the flesh from the column on one side but the flesh remained—he then severed the column fromfrwn the head with the knife preserving the whole of the fourth and fifth vertebra—that column was not dissected longitudinally in my presence—I do not know whether it was dissected at all—I am not aware that we made any observation on the neck during the operation of direction except on the retraction of the muscles—I mean the muscles were less they were retracted—I am not aware of any other observation on the neck—Mr Girdwood has that column now—the body of the verte bra was sawn through—from the jagged appearance of the bone I should say it was not cut through with a knife—from the rough appearance I would say so—it appeared to be done with a saw—it was rough all through—I do not think a notched knife would have done it—I think this saw would have done it—I did not observe whether there was any spinal marrow in the filth vertebra—I made no remark on it whatever Q In what part of the skull in the corresponding integument was it you found the internal bruise A This part pointing to hit own head just on the occipitis—rather more at the left side than the centre of the head Q Supposing that to proceed from a blow on the back of the head might it create a suffusion of blood within the head A I cannot give an opinion of that—it might or it might not MR GILBERT FINLAY GIRDWOOD I am a surgeon of the parish of Paddington—I am not a member of the College of Surgeons—I passed my examination at Edinburgh—I have been practising as a surgeon twelve years—I examined the head of a female at Paddington workhouse on Sunday the 8th of January—Mr Birtwistle was present at the time alio Mr Lucas and some other medical men—there are three published doc* ments which I drew up at the time—they are copies of my original notes—I have not the original notes with me—they have all been published—the first was made at the inquest—that was before I examined the bed—it had reference to the trunk only—I published an account of the appearances of the head on the very day it was examined on Monday the 9th of January a note of it was given to the churchwardens and to the newspapers—i saw it afterwards in the newspapers—I saw the head on Sunday the 8th of January at Mile-end workhouse and examined it very cursorily—on the 9th between nine and ten o clock in the morning I went into a more detailed examination—the bead was brought to the work-house during the night—upon examining it on the 9th the head had the appearance of being that of a female—the nose was slightly flattened about the centre and it had a slight twist of the tip to the right side—there were several wounds and bruises—there was a large wound on the left cheek in the shape of a crescent commencing a short way under the left eye and terminating on the same level as the mouth and about a inch or an inch and a half from it—it was an incised wound—it was merely superficial—it entered into the cellular membrane and the fat underneath-in my judgment that wound was inflicted after death—there was under that wound a large contused wound over the lower jaw—the jaw was there fractured—that injury in my judgment was inflicted after death-on the other side of the face there was another contused wound at the right angle of the lower jaw there too the bone on that side was broken—on that side too there was a wound partly contused and partly in-incised and which opened right through into the mouth— those two lit ter injuries were sustained after death —it opened right through into the mouth and by that means made the mouth larger continuing the moots along the cheek several of the teeth of the upper jaw were forced out and the tongue was crushed between them—that appeared to me all part of the same injury—the right eye had received a blow—there was a wound in the eye itself above the pupil which had entered into the eye and occasioned the escape of the humours of the eye around the eye above-below and there was a mark a round ecchymosis surrounding the eye presenting the appearance not of an ordinary but of an extraordinary black eye as to its severity—it was of the same species—I might call it what would follow a black eye but to a considerable extent—within the area of this bruised appearance there were three small superficial wounds was external to the orbit of the eye one was superior to the orbit of the eye and the other was situated on the side of the nose and exposed the bone of the nose Q In your judgment was the injury you have described to the eye inflicted during the life of the party or after death A I believe the wound in the eye and the bruise around it to have been inflicted during life and I believe also the three small wounds I have alluded to to have been inflicted after death—the circumstance of the eye being ruptured would imply great force—it might be the result of a blow with the fist of a person—I think it could not be referable to a blow with a dull weapon—there was no mark on the surface of abrasion—abrasion is more likely to follow a blow by a bludgeon than a blow by a hand—I mean abrasion of the skin—it is almost impossible to say whether it was inflicted with a fiat or instrument—I could not form any definite opinion—a blow struck with the violence I judge this to have been inflicted with would certainly deprive the party so struck of sense for the moment and at the moment for a time—the length of time it would do so depends entirely on the individual—one person would bear a blow very differently to another—it depends on the effect produced on the nervous system on the vital energies of life—this being a female subject it is very possible the blow would deprive her of senses so as to enable further injury to be given to her during that period of insensibility Q Supposing on the blow being struck in front the back of the head was to be driven in contact with any thing would that tend to increase the period for which insensibility would follow A I think it very likely—there were two appearances behind which I have not yet described on the crows of the head—it was a large contused wound—that is all—it was two wounds together—there were two bruised surfaces coming into one another continuous—they had been done after death—it was a semilunar wound having two tail as I may say—on turning back the scalp which we cat through from ear to ear by cutting a little and exposing the upper part of the skull on the pos—I tenor surface on the left side in the cellular membrane underneath the skin and in those muscular fibres called the occipilo-frontalis muscle existed an ecchymose appearance—I opened the head and found an internal injury corresponding with the outside—on the outer covering of the brain called the dura mater there existed a slight redness an unnatural redness not visible any where else—that was opposite to the place where the ecchymosis appeared—that was so far a serious injury that serous effusion on the dura mater indicated a disturbance within Q Now was there in your judgment any connexion between the injury in the eye and that at the back of the head A I could not but think that the one was the result of the other—that the appearances behind were the result of the injury in front—that is on the supposition that the head when struck in front came in contact with some resisting body—there was this relation between the two injuries that it was on the opposite side of a round body and a round body struck on one side if opposed by striking against something will show that something has struck there—the external appearance of the skull would not be caused by the blow in front sup posing it did not strike against any thing at all—the internal derangement which was presented might have been the result of a blow in front supposing the back of the head did not come in contact with any thing—by the derangement I mean the slight redness on the dura mater as well as the disturbance which that intimated—the appearance in the eye could not possibly be caused by a blow struck at the back of the head—whether that injury was by a blow a fall or any other means it could not have caused the appearances in front—I afterwards proceeded to examine the throat—the head had been separated from the trunk at the fifth bone of the neck which was sawn through—not entirely but partly—I have fitted the saw produced to the bone and it appeared to me to correspond—the greater part of the anterior portion of the bone was sawn through and the other part of it appeared to have been broken off—the posterior part—it was sawn nearly through from the front and then broken off—there was no appearance of discolouration of the neck—the fleshy part of the neck appeared to have been cut with a sharp instrument—such an instrument as this looking at the knife would be adapted to the purpose—it is something in the form of a surgical knife—it has a spring at the back which makes the blade firm—the muscles where they were divided were very much retracted—the muscles do retract for some time after death—as long as warmth continues or until the rigidity of death begins Q Supposing a person to meet a violent death suddenly being in good health at the time how long would that state of the muscles which would cause them to retract continue A I cannot speak from experience but I should say it would continue some time of course—in all states after death this retraction of the muscles will continue some time—certainly some hours—but the retracting power which is often very strong at the moment of death gets less and less every hour and at last ceases—it would be less too if much blood was lost at the moment of death—the retracting power would continue for a shorter time inasmuch as the body would sooner get cold and rigid—I found all the large blood-vessels of the head empty and the same as to the trunk—there were other wounds about the neck independent of that which severed it from the body but they were all part of the same attempt in cutting the neck—the superficial cut was very ragged Q We have not yet got to that—independent of the cutting of the neck did you find some superficial cutting about the neck A Yes the tomination of the wounds which were carried round and round the neck—the neck was evidently cut in front at first—the first incision commencing on the left side in the fold which exists where the bead joins the neck high up exactly here putting his finger uider hit ear —it passes along the fold in front of the neck behind this ear and terminates on the right side—that cut was not continuous round the neck—the continuation of the cut appears to have been jagged on the right side—the division of the muscles becoming now deeper and deeper and at the same time lower down the neck so that the incision which has cut through the windpipe is full two inches under the first superficial incision which I have already described—this cut through the windpipe has cut also through the carotid arteries and it is on a level with the division of the vertebra—there is a superficial cut high up in front not penetrating the windpipe and two inches below that there is the main cut which separated the head from the body—there is thus left a flap of skin in front adhering to the trunk—that would have supplied the space between the two cuts and then the posterior cut of the skin coming round on the right side leaves a flap about two inches long adhering to the neck Q Do these circumstances denote that there was an attempt to cut the throat and inflict a slight injury in addition to the main cut which divided the head from the body A I cannot form any opinion positively on that point COURT Q What was it the appearance suggested to you was it that an unskilful man had attempted to separate the head after death A The suggestion I formed having seen a wound in the eye which might or might not prove mortal was that the cut in the throat certainly must have proved mortal—the cut above was certainly the first cut and the cut must have been inflicted during life or very shortly after death Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q You have described to us now all the wounds you perceived both externally and internally on the head A As far as I can recollect—I do not recollect having omitted any thing—I examined the brain but I have not been asked to give any account of its appearance—there were two large bruised wounds on the outside of the head which I have mentioned and one partly bruised and partly incised and there was the large double wound I have mentioned on the top of the head—bruise and contusion are synonymous terms—it depends entirely on the force with which a bruise or contusion has been given whether they will show ecchymosis—bruise and contusion being synonymous terms if either one or the I other is inflicted with sufficient force they will produce ecchymosis—a contusion after death will not produce the appearance called ecchymosis—a contusion or bruise might effect a lodgment of blood within the head or it might not—it would not under the bone—a blow on the back of the head may cause a lodgment of blood within the head—it may do so under the bone but not a great lodgment of blood know no means how it could escape except by absorption—blood when dislodged is not obedient to the law of gravitation in a living body not to any extent—it is subject to the law of gravitation as far as the law of gravitation can be allowed to have its effect in a living body—a living body has the means of disposing of a lodgment of blood which the dead body is without—in any part—you are not alluding to the cranium—I beg leave to say a lodgment of blood in the cranium could not take place to any great extent—an internal effusion of blood caused by a blow on the back of the head would be likely to find a lodgment either in the dura mater or in various parts of the brain—it entirely depends on the peculiarity of the individual wherever the vessel happened to give way which effused the blood—I never knew a blow on the skull inflict a wound exactly on the opposite side of the skull—a blow on the back part of the head might produce injury exactly opposite within the skull a contre coup but not the eye which is without the skull—the venous portion of the eye would not be the natural position for blood lodged in the cavity of the brain to escape—a blow received behind will inflict injury in front—the cause of that injury in front would be as to its effect in a mechanical manner—if you strike one part of a circle then the whole of that circle will be dis turbed and it will occasionally produce fracture of the skull in the oppo site part but in most cases the fracture is received behind as blows generally are given in front Q How long will the head of a human being after death generally speaking be capable of ecchymosis A I have said you cannot produce the phenomena of ecchymosis on a dead body—it is impossible to do so although warm—a blow given half an hour after death would communicate avidity on the surface—I am speaking from experiment from my own knowledge of the fact—you will have a discolouration of the surface—I did not describe the black eye as discolouration Q What is the difference between lividity and a black eye A in a black eye you have a phenomena of ecchymosis which you do not have in the dead body—the ecchymosis of a bruise or contusion consists in having blood effused in all the tissues which have been interested in the blow—there is also the existence of blood throughout those membranes in the minutest blood vessel by membrane I mean tissue which in health do not contain this red blood—there is also the existence of swelling—there are some other phenomena but these three are the important ones—there is at times a yellow colour round the external edge of the ecchmosis what we call a black eye will sometimes not be apparent at first—then in a black eye which will not assume that appearance until a considerable time after the blow—I never saw a black eye that did not immeadiately afterwards assume that appearance I mean the puffiness—the outer skin va ries a little in different persons—a blow on the chest of a person who has considerable flesh between the muscles and the cuticle might not be ecchymosed—if the skin be thin ecchymosis may be almost instantaneous but you are supposing cases which I have not seen Q With respect to the neck I think you have elsewhere described that the section which removed the head proceeded across the neck anteriorly through the skin immediately under the fold formed by the junction of the chin with the neck A Not immediately but under it—I am the author of the report of the examination of the head of the female in the medical Gazette—I do not wish to correct that statement—there is no correction necssary—what I have said here is but a different mode of expressing the same thing—the posterior cut of the neck was exactly on a line with the section of the vertebral column Q How long in your opinion will blood generally flow after immediate death A There have been experiments to show that blood will flow for many hours after death—I think blood will flow for several hours from a vessel divided after death—there is an experiment to prove what you wish—I think it is sixteen hours—I am not quite sure I talk only from memory Q Then during that time the blood vessels of the head might be emp tied by severing the head from the trunk A The large vessels—it might or might not—but that would depend on the death of the party the ok time the blood coagulates and a variety of circumstances—I have no experiment to prove in how long the head might be emptied by severance after death I cannot speak from experience—I cannot say whether the wound which occasioned the division of the head from the trunk was done in great haste—I really cannot judge of haste COURT Q Was it done as a surgeon would do it in any experiment A Certainly not MR PRICE Q You are quite of opinion that the fifth vertebra was sawn through A I am quite sure of that—I have them to show that fact—I divided the portion of the cervical column which was left on the head the bones called the vertebral column that is the cervical vertebra which is attached to the head the four and three quarters which is attached to the head—the fifth was sawn through—I did not myself divide it—it was done by my orders in my presence and I think I assisted—we took it off at the atlas—I am not certain that that now forms one end of the portion of the column I have here—it may or may not—it may have been removed but at the time it was severed 1 think it did—I think the dentatus processus is still attached to the column—I think that portion of the column was left perfect but I have not examined it since—I have never taken the trouble to divide the column longitudinally nor transversely Q Then you can give us no account of the state of the spinal marrow A No not in that part of the column—we looked into the spinal marrow—I have the means of knowing if the spine was injured—I saw the marrow at the end of the column where it was sawn across—but I have not traced it through its course—it is now lodged in the column of the body—I do not know whether any thing has been done with it and the bones that were removed—the cervical spine has been sawn through—I have examined the bones externally and had there been any injury inflicted by any external cause it would have produced some injury in the bone Q Is it possible for the spinal marrow to be injured without leaving appearances on the bone A When you talk of possibility it is possible for instance a needle might be introduced to the spinal marrow—there was no injury that I am aware of to the spinal marrow—it could not receive any injury that I am aware of to occasion death—there was not the slightest injury in the parts—an accident creating pressure on the spinal chord would occasion death certainly—T should ascertain that fact by exmining the marrow but I might not ascertain it by doing so—by examining I may perceive an injury and I may not perceive it Q A person might die from injury to the spinal marrow and leave no trace behind A In a locked jaw there is no appearance whatever—there would be an appearance of fixedness—there are no appearances that I know of in persons dying of hydrophobia—there might be this injury to the spinal marrow or nervous system—I mean injury to one of the nerves of the thumb which sometimes will occasion a locked jaw—a locked jaw is an injury to the nervous system—there might be pressure on the spinal chord and death not ensue but it might so happen that death may ensue from it—an injury of the spinal marrow might produce death or it might not—an injury to the spinal marrow in one part might product instant death but I do not think it could be produced without producing tome effusion round it which would be of a bloody character or of a serous character—I mean around the spinal marrow externally—if the spinal marrow was injured at its juncture with the brain a small injury might occasion instant death but if you examine that body after death I think you will find perhaps a very small blood-vessel or effusion of blood or you might have the spinal marrow itself shortened or slackened—I exa mined the neck on Monday the 9th of January—I had seen it before but I examined it anatomically on the 9th Q You have said that the external appearance would be slight—is it possible that the immersion of the head and its remaining in the water for eight or ten days would have rendered the detection of that injury more difficult or not A I do not think it would make any difference—you are alluding to the injury of the spinal marrow taking place where I have named—I should think it would be necessary to examine the marrow itself to be able to say positively that a person died of injury to the spinal marrow—a blow on the back of the neck might be capable of killing but it depends entirely on what the blow is—any blow may be capable of killing which at all shakes the vital spark not that shakes the spinal marrow—a blow on the stomach might cause instant death—I have said almost all blows of any great severity may be mortal—it all depends on whe ther they affect a vital part—I think it very possible that a blow disordering he spinal marrow would occasion death but I cannot imagine a blow being given in such a case without having external appearances—I cannot imagine a blow to have occasioned such an injury to the spinal marrow as to occasion death which would not show it after death—I certainly have no right to infer things are not possible because I have not met with them—I am talking generally from what I have observed and experienced—I cannot conceive violent muscular action of the neck capable of causing death—I do not see where the injury could be effected by the muscular action of the neck—violent muscular action of the neck will not disorder the os coccygis—I never knew the thigh broken by the action of the nuclei Q I will suppose a case of a man balancing on a chair and losing his equilibrium might not the muscular operation of the neck in endeavouring to recover itself inflict an injury on the neck of the person so as to cause death A I cannot imagine such a case—I am not at all aware of any thing likely to produce such a circumstance—I cannot conceive a case of the sort—I know no case at all like what you describe—it might injure a fibre or ligament—the muscle confining the dentatus processes is a very strong one—if that ligament was ruptured it might occasion death—if it permitted the spinal marrow to be injured in all probability it would occasion death—the dentatus processus is not the next vessel to the spat it is the axis on which the head turns COURT Q Supposing what the learned gentleman has supposed to take place would it leave any external appearance A In the spinal marrow it would but not on the surface of the skin—that injury had not happened—if it had I should have detected it in examination MR PRICE Q Then you do not think such an injury could occur so as to affect or injure the spinal marrow without leaving an appearance on the external part of the bone A Certainly not—the termination of the spinal marrow was examined where it joins the brain and there was no appearance—I am now speaking of the dentatus processus—I have been confining myself during the whole examination to that exact part Q Are there not other parts of the spinal marrow from the atlas don to the seventh vertebra the injury of which might occasion death A I have said an injury to the spinal marrow may or may not produce instant death—it is not very likely it would produce instant death if it was not at the place I have described—many cases are on record where injuries haw been inflicted in that place where paralysis of the lower parts hare taken place and where instant death has not followed where in fact they ban recovered—I have already said I believe all sorts of accidents may be fatal—it depends on the state of the nervous system COURT Q What do you mean by all sorts of accidents A Affecting vital parts—injury lower down than the part alluded to may produce death as it may so strike the nervous system as that death may immedi-ately follow MR PRICE Q Even though it should be with reference to that part which with this particular spine was still left on the trunk A I have said there was no injury to that—injury might happen to that portion of spine left on the trunk it by no means follows that death would ensue but it might take place by its effect on the general nervous system—pulsation ceases instantaneously after death—it is one of the three great links that connect life together—death cannot be instantaneously detected—to constitute death there must be no pulsation but that does not imply that you have discovered that death exists—if I was Called to a dead body I should not like to decide on that person being dead until I had examined other things than simply pulsation Q But may not an ordinary person detect death as soon as it has taken place and that by detecting the cessation of pulsation A Certainly not it would be no proof—I should not myself be satisfied by that symptom alone—I should not be satisfied that the body was dead after the pulsation appeared to have ceased two or three minutes nor in a week after by simply examining the pulse—I mean the pulse at the wrist—how I should ascertain pulsation ceasing would be to apply my ear to the region of the newt—it would be there I should be able to detect the indication of the smallest pulsation—it could not be ascertained by applying the hand to the heart—is a medical man I should advise no one to be satisfied by applying the hand to the heart—I do not think it right to determine that death has taken place without applying the ear to the heart—I examined the trunk of the body on Thursday the last week in December I think the 29th the day after it was found—I came to the conclusion that the parts had been cut away shortly after death by the very great retraction of the muscles of the neck—the bloodless state of the body was one of the causes which led me to conclude that the mutilation had taken place shortly after death—by mutilation I mean the cutting of the neck and legs—I believe nobody mis—I understands the phrase—that would not be applicable to amputation—that applies to a living subject—amputation is a thing done for the advantage of man mutilation has an adverse signification—but I did not use it with that motive—if a surgeon were said to have mutilated a member it would found reproachfully to men of science—but it has several signiflcations—it depends on the way in which it is used COURT Q It may be used in a good sense or bad A yes it nay be used to explain a fact without reproach MR PRICE Q If a patient s arm should be severed by a sabre the phrase mutilation would then be proper A One man might sty it was mutilated another that it was cut off—mutilation does not convey the idea of suffering pain to my mind—I did not examine the internal part of the stomach—I looked into it—I opened it—I did not cut into it—I opened the orifice—the stomach was removed from the body—I simply looked into it and ascertained that there was no injury done to the internal coat—I found some undigested food in the stomach—I think I smelt it but I really forget—I think I did—I have said it had a spirituous well—I was satisfied with a very cursory examination—I think I smelt it and said There seems a little smell here I only satisfied myself of the existence of the undigested food—it was then closed up and tent to Dr Hunter Lane—I did not remark of what spirit the stomach smelt—I have seen at different times all the parts of this body—the hands for a female were large—she was nearly five feet eight inches high—that is a random guess by comparing her with two other women—I find now she was about an inch and a half shorter—I believe that is some-where about the middle height of women—I believe five feet four is about the middle height I should say she was a well-formed perfect woman externally—a woman of strength and capable of vigorous exertion and as far as I could judge in perfect health and fine condition MR BODKIN Q You have been asked about lividity and eechymosis are they clearly distinguishable from each other A Clearly—using the pharse lividity as the appearance of a dead body and ecchymosis as what will sometimes exist in a bruise on a living body—I am quite certain the appearance on the eye was the result of an injury inflicted during life and not the result of livor after death—I use the phrase livor as express-ing after death—I found the swelling in this case which I have spoken of as one of the symptoms of ecchymosis—there was a thickening of that part a puffiness of that part which presented the bruised appearance-that would certainly not follow any injury inflicted after death Q If there had been any lodgment of blood from an injury to the back of the skull in this particular case would that blood have been effused into the eye so as to have caused ecchymosis A Certainly not it is impossible—I have particularly specified there was no appearance on that part of the bone next the brain and which is over the eye—there was no injury sustained to the brain on that part but on looking through the very thin bone which covers the eye there was a sort of dulness which I considered coagulated blood within the orbit of the eye and a subsequent examination proved that opinion correct Q Would that appearance in the orbit of the eye be one of the conse quences of a violent blow in the eye as you have spoken of A Certainly—the spinal marrow is subject to disease the same as all other parts of the human body—disease may arise spontaneously or be occasioned by some powerful effect on the nervous system as a whole—I vever knew heard or read of a case in which sudden death was produced by in-ternal injury to the lower part of the spinal marrow without some ex-ternal marks accompanying it—on looking at the subject on the whole there are two facts which immediately struck roe—in the first place there was a very severe blow inflicted on the eye during life and that blow has a corresponding bruise on the back part of the head—there was on the dura mater a little serous fluid or blood existing—this group of facts is such as to lead me to say that such an injury might be mortal but certainly if that had not been so the cutting of the neck would have been neces-sarily mortal—I allude to the whole group of facts—from the external and internal examinations—I say the blow in the eye and the injury behind the flowing of serous matter these together form such as would occasion death but if not the cutting of the neck would necessarily do it Q Is that on the supposition that the injury at the back of the head was the consequence of the blow in front A It is certainly—I delivered the stomach to MR GUY DR JAMES HUNTER LANE I am a Physician residing in Euston-square—I also lecture on chemistry and forensic medicine The stomach of the deceased was brought to me by Mr Guy a student of the school—he is in attendance—I proceeded to examine and analyze the contents—on opening the stomach I found it to contain a quantity of mat which I supposed to be either pork or beef—it was preserved pork or beef potatoes and pastry also a quantity of fluid the whole mixture having a spirituous smell—the stomach in its appearance was healthy at one part there being a slight redness which generally accompanies the process of healthy digestion—with regard to the attempt to distinguish what description of spirit it was we could only come to the general conclusion of negative evidence that it was not whiskey and it was not rum—my reason for coming to that conclusion is this that on exposing whiskey or rum to the atmosphere they still have their odour for some time but with regard to gin that is not applicable I put this circumstance to the test whether by exposing those liquors to the at-mosphere they would leave any portion of smell behind—both whiskey and rum did while gin did not—it was but a small portion of spirit in conse quence of the small amount of fluid contained in the stomach—I should say it was certainly not sufficient to cause intoxication—I should conceive that the digestion was about half completed only—I made no other observ ation except the question whether the individual could have died presenting those appearances from drunkenness and in consequence of the absence of all morbid appearances in the stomach I conclude she could not—and there being no portion of poison in the stomach in the absence of all de-struction of the stomach or morbid appearance we came to the conclusion she had not taken poison—as far as the stomach is concerned I conceive death must have been sudden and while the individual was in possession of cool health as there was evidence of digestion still going on COURT Q Was there any appearance of tea in the stomach A There was no smell of tea and there was no appearance of milk HENRY GUY I am a student in medicine I received the stomach of the deceased from Mr Gird wood and took it to Dr Lane as I received it DR LANE Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q You have confined your-self to whiskey rum and gin A Those are the three experiments I made in reference to this particular case—I have not tried brandy—there is a very considerable difference between the evaporation of spirits in the stomach and in the open air—in making an observation of that sort I must give my reasons for stating what I believe to be the nature of the difference—in the stomach it will necessarily be considerably less than in the atmosphere—its being mixed with tea will not make any difference in the delay or expedition of evaporation—it will have the effect of destroying the odour of gin completely—green tea if used in considerable portions to gin will completely cover the odour—it will not have the same effect with rum—it would cover the odour of gin in proportion to the quantity—I have no means of knowing whether any of the spirituous matter bad been ejected from the stomach—the presumption is and the direct evidence that none had been vomited—the stomach was not full by any means—I cannot say what quantity had been digested—I cannot undertake to say the stomach had not been full—I believe it was about ten or twelve days after the 24th of December that I examined the contents of the stomach—that was long enough for the odour to have con siderably escaped but not wholly to escape—I speak advisedly when I make that assertion Mr John Freeman stone-merchant Millbank-row Westminster deposed to the prisoner Gale s good character from November 1883 to January 1834 when she was a wet-nurse in his family GREENACRE— GUILTY— DEATH —Aged 42 GALE—

t18380101-386  386 GEORGE CLUTTERBUCK was charged on the Coroner s inquisition with the wilful murder of Thomas Hawe and also indicted for the manslaughter of the said Thomas Hawe MR STURGEON conducted the Prosecution THOMAS BURN I am a coal-whipper and live in Great George-street Bethnal-green I knew the deceased Thomas Hawe—he was a coal-whipper—I had known him for about three weeks and a month—on Saturday evening the 9th or 10th of December I was in his company at the Queen s Head at the corner of North-street Mile-end-road—the prisoner was there and a young woman named Jane Bubb—there was a dispute between the prisoner and the deceased about Jane Bubb—the prisoner told her to keep herself to herself and not to be talking to other young men—she had come there with the prisoner and she was talking to the deceased—the prisoner then said he would strike her if she did not keep herself to herself—the deceased said in his presence that he should not—that was all that passed—they left there afterwards—on the next Tuesday I was at work with the deceased all day and went to the Northampton Arms public-house in the evening between eight and nine o clock-—the prisoner was in the tap-room when I got there—the deceased came there a little after ten o clock-t-the prisoner had come about nine o clock—I did not hear the prisoner say any thing in the tap-room—I did not see the other people come down to him afterwards—I was up stairs in the same house about ten o clock—there were thirty or forty persons there as near as I can guess—Jane Bubb was there and the deceased—the deceased went down stairs and in about five minutes returned with Jane Bubb and she went and sat by his tide— they came up together—she sat down by the side of the prisoner and kept laughing and sneering all the time at the prisoner—the deceased then sang a song and in a few minutes after he got up to go and Jane Bubb with him—the prisoner all the time appeared much agitated—all the while the was in the room sneering and laughing at him and when they got up to go away he jumped off his seat ran to the door and went down stairs and they followed him—I followed them and when I got round the stairs I heard the deceased say Don t strike her —I suppose he said so to the prisoner—the staircase goes round—as soon as I got round the first thing I saw was the deceased either strike or push the prisoner and he went back about a yard and a half against the partition—the deceased then followed him and doubled his fist—they then struggled together with their hand round each other s neck—they bad about one of two hits at each other as I thought—I then stepped in between them and said Drop it —the deceased made answer He has got a knife —I then laid hold of the prisoner s hand and held it till a young man named Stiff came down and took a knife out of the prisoner s right hand—it was open—I did not see any blood on it—it had a black and white handle—it was a sharp-pointed knife—a common clasped knife which men are in the habit of using—the deceased was taken to the hospital—I saw him again the next evening alive—I saw him after he was dead at the Coroner s Inquest—this is the knife— looking at it —that was the knife given to me by James Holland Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You use such a knife at this yourself do you not A Yes—there is nothing particular about it—the deceased either struck or pushed the prisoner and he fell back about a yard and a half against the partition Q From the time that happened until the deceased told you that the prisoner had a knife had the prisoner time to put his hand into his pocket or take it out and open it A No COURT Q Do you understand the question A Yes MR PHILLIPS Q In the course of the scuffle between the two did not toe prisoner fall down holding his hands out to try to prevent his falling A He held them down—he did fall against the partition—there was a gas light at the bar near where he fell—if he had put his hand into his pocket and pulled out the knife I must have seen it—he did not do so CODRT Q Which was the most powerful man A The deceased was a much more powerful man than the prisoner and I think he was the elder man—he seemed about twenty-three or twenty-four years of age—the prisoner appeared very angry up in the room when the girl was sneering and laughing at him and very much excited all the time they were in toe room—he appeared so that he could hardly sit on his seat MR PHILLIPS Q I believe the deceased was a married man A I have heard so since SAMUEL STIFF I am a coal-porter and live in North-street Whitechapel-road On Saturday night the 12th of December last I was at the Queen s Head—I saw the deceased the prisoner and Jane Bubb there—Jane Bubb was sitting between the two—the deceased got up and said There is a vagabond who says he will strike the girl because she spoke to me —I saw the prisoner mutter to himself but was too far off to know what he said—I saw no more of them that night—I saw them on the Tuesday evening afterwards at the Northampton Arms up stairs in the singing room—I went up with some friends—when I had been there a short time the deceased came up with two friends—I heard him sing a song—I went down and when I came up again I saw him sitting by the side of Jane Bubb and she was laughing and jeering at the prisoner who appeared greatly excited at their conduct—the deceased and Bubb got up with the intention of going down—the prisoner rushed down before them—I heard a noise and followed immediately—when I came down I saw the deceased and the witness Burn and the prisoner—the prisoner held a knife in his right hand—Burn was holding him by his right hand and I took the knife out of his hand—the affray was all over when I got down Q Can you tell us what the prisoner was doing up stairs when he was so much excited—was he eating or drinking A I did not observe him—I think there was a pint of beer before him—he was sitting at the table—I did not see any thing in his hand when he rushed out to go down stairs Cross-examined Q Did not the unfortunate prisoner appear almost beside himself with agitation and excitement A He appeared very much agitated—it is not a room where they take bread and cheese and chops—they drink there—the prisoner s back was towards me in the room CATHERINE HATES I am servant at the Northampton Arms I remember the Tuesday night in question—I saw the deceased that night and the prisoner and Jane Bubb—they were up stairs—I saw the prisoner in the tap-room and also up stairs—he did not come to the bar to me—he came to the house by himself and Bubb came with the deceased—they did not dance together that evening that was on Saturday—Todd and Clark were down in the tap-room when the prisoner called me down into the tap-room—the prisoner had said to me that Tuesday afternoon that if Bubb came there that night he would give her a good hiding—that was before she came with the deceased—I never heard him threaten to give her a good hiding before that—I remember their dancing together at our place on the Saturday before—he had been complaining of her then—after they came on this Tuesday evening the prisoner came and called me down stairs into the tap-room and gave me a knife a pocket-book half a brace and another book besides—he told me to take care of them till the morning—I told him I would take care of them and told him not to go up stairs any more—I left him in the tap-room with Clark and Todd—after putting his things away I went up stairs for his beer and brought it down stairs—he afterwards came up stairs again and brought his beer back and soon after he went up the deceased and Bubb got up to come down stairs—when the prisoner saw it he rushed out and came down before them—he got before the girl in the passage and asked her where she was going to and he struck her—the deceased saw it the returned back from the bar and struck the prisoner—they were then in the passage—he appeared a more powerful man than the prisoner and they struggled—he appeared to me to strike him hard—I do not know whether he went backwards in consequence of the blow but they struggled together and the deceased fell—I cannot say how long they struggled together—it was not very long—I saw the deceased strike the prisoner once but not after the first blow—when the deceased fell I picked him up brought his hat to the bar and told the girl to go out—the deceased ran to the prisoner again and they struggled again—the prisoner was standing by when I picked up the deceased—I stooped down to hold him up—I left the deceased s hat at the bar—I do not know what happened after they struggled the second time for I picked up the deceased s hat and told Bubb to go out and as I returned from the bar I saw several young men trying to get the knife from the prisoner—it was in his hand—there were a good many other persons in the passage besides me—a good many were coming down the stairs and when they heard the scuffling they all ran down COURT Q Was there a confusion in the passage when the struggle took place A Yes there was a gas-light before the bar not far from where the struggle took place—it was as far as I am from your lordship— about six yards —I cannot say how wide the passage is—it is not very wide—it is not so wide as the jury-box-—it is wider than one division of it—I cannot say how wide it is—the girl and I and the two men struggling were in the passage—the rest were coming down stairs—Burn was in the passage during the struggle—I kept the knife which the prisoner had given me and gave it to my master—the prisoner never had that Cross-examined Q Is this the knife he gave you producing one A I believe it is—I put it into the kitchen-drawer and master had it—I cannot swear it is the knife—the prisoner did not attempt to strike the deceased at all while he was on the ground—after I picked him up the prisoner was standing still and the deceased made a rush at him again—I did not observe any hurt on the deceased when I picked him up—he complained of nothing the first time Q Do they smoke cigars in the room up stairs A They do—I do not remember the prisoner having any cigars—I do not know whether they sometimes cut a bit off the top of a cigar to light it—I did not observe the prisoner put his hand into his pocket at all in the passage COURT Q He might have done it without your seeing it A Yes he might MR PHILLIPS Q Do you know whether the deceased was a married man A I do not MARTHA HAMBLETON I am the landlady of the Northampton Arms I remember the Tuesday evening this occurred—I saw the prisoner just before the scuffle took place in the passage go out of the house—he was gone about five minutes—when he came back as he was going up the stairs I called him down again—he appeared very much agitated and looked very pale and I thought he was crying—I told him I hoped he would not go up stairs to cause any disturbance—he assured me he would not but that he would have a b—good row that night—he promised me he would not cause any disturbance in the house because if he did I said I would have him put out and the girl too—he said he hoped I would for she had been the ruin of him—he then went up stairs and a little time after I heard a scuffle in the passage—I then saw the prisoner and the deceased struggling with each other in the passage—I did not see the blow struck—I thought they were fighting and immediately ordered the man to put the prisoner out of doors—I did not see any thing material—my man put him out of doors and he came in again—this was after the transaction was over but I did not then know the young man was stabbed—I sent for a doctor COURT Q How old is the prisoner A I do not know his age nor what trade he is—he had been to the house with the young woman but I had not seen them dancing together—there is dancing up stain on a Saturday night at our house Q Who is Bubb is she a woman of bad or good character A I cannot speak of my own knowledge—I never saw nor heard of her before WILLIAM CLARK I am a carpenter and live at No 1 Darling-row Last Tuesday night three weeks the 12th of December I was at the Northampton-arms—I saw the prisoner there—he came into the taproom and said God strike him dead or God strike him b—dead if he did not have his revenge that night—he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a pocket-book and a pocket handkerchief—he gave the pocket-book to Kitty Hayes the servant girl and the handkerchief be put back again into his pocket—he also pulled out something else which I did not see—he said I won t give you that and if the b—hits me I will run it into him —I then walked out of the tap-room and was going up stairs—he followed me out into the passage and went into the back yard—I went up stairs—he came up directly afterwards and sat by the side of me—a young man got up and sang a song and directly the song was over the deceased and Jane Bubb got up to go out-—the prisoner went out first and the deceased and Jane Bubb went afterwards—they were down stairs two or three minutes and I heard a scuffle but I did not go down till it was all over—I saw nothing more Cross-examined Q Did I understand you rightly that he took out the pocket-book from his coat pocket and gave it to Kitty A Yes—he pulled the handkerchief out with the pocket-book but put the handkerchief back again—he then appeared to me to pull something else out of his pocket but I did not see it—that was after giving the pocket-book to Hayes—the expression he made use of was I won t give you that and if the b—hits me I will run it into him —I have given all the expres sions he used Q Have you ever had any quarrel with the prisoner A Yes I was about four years ago and fought him—we fought two rounds—Todd was present at the conversation I have stated JOHN TODD I am a labourer and live in Forster-street I was present when the prisoner gave the pocket-book to Catherine Hayes—he came down stairs and seemed very much agitated and gave Kitty the pocket book and a knife—he made believe to take something else out of his lefthand coat pocket—Kitty took the knife and pocket-book and went into the kitchen—when he made believe to take something from his left-hand coat pocket he said This I will keep and if the b—touches me I will put it into him —as he left the room he said God strike me dead or b—dead I will put the knife into him —that was as he left the room after he had delivered the pocket-book—he said God strike him dead or b—dead he would put the knife into him if he touched him and rip his bowels out Cross-examined Q Where was Clark when he made use of the observation that he would rip his bowels out A Standing alongside the fireplace—he made use of the expression loudly so that I heard him plainly—I was standing alongside of Clark at the time the prisoner said it—it was as he was going out he said it—that was the last I heard—Clark went out and I went home—he was going out of the room with Clark when he said be would rip his bowels out COURT Q Did you ever say any thing about what he said going out of the room before to-day A Yes at Lambeth-street before the Magistrate and I stated it before the Coroner—he said he would put his knife into him and let his bowels out if he touched him Q It does not appear to have been taken down—how came it to be omitted in your deposition A I do not know MR PHILLIPS Q Have you ever had any quarrel with the prisoner A No never—nor any dispute with him lately—I had a little bit of a quarrel with him once but we made it up and have been good friends since that—I cannot say how long that is ago—it was a long time before this transaction but I cannot say how long—it was about his striking this same girl Jane Bubb—it is a long time ago and we have been good friends since—I found him striking her and I told him not to do it—we have made it up a long time and been friends—we had two or three blows about it Q Who had the best of it A I cannot say that either of us got much the worse from it—I am nineteen years old—I should say to the best of my recollection it was six or seven months ago that we had the quarrel—I do not know how old the prisoner is—he is a labourer I believe—I believe Bubb is a slop-maker—she is a young woman THOMAS BLIZARD CURLING I am a surgeon of the London Hospital About eleven o clock on the night of the 12th of December I remember a man being brought in—he had a wound on the right side of the belly about an inch and three quarters in extent—it was a serious wound—the bowels were protruding and the patient bleeding—he died of that wound—it might have been made by the knife produced BENJAMIN CORDELL I am a policeman I was on duty near the Northampton Arras on the 12th of December and was called in—I took the prisoner into custody outside the house—I then went inside to solicit somebody to go as a witness with me and when I went into the house the parties there came round two or three saying one thing or another—I said Who will go with me to the station-house who saw what took place —the prisoner expressed a desire to go and see the deceased—I took him into the tap-room—he stooped over some of their heads and looked at him—I walked with him to the front of the bar and he put his arm down on his head and staid there for a while—I said Cheer up perhaps it may be better than you expect —I took him out and in going along the road he said How do you think it will go with me —I said I am sure I can t say but by all the appearance of the man it seems to me he won t live to reach the hospital —he said Well I might have done it as I had been eating a bit of bread and cheese just before with my knife in my hand —and directly afterwards he said I wish you would lend me a knife as I wish if I can get an opportunity to put an end to my own existence —he said directly afterwards that he had been treated very ill by the girl who had been walking up and down the room laughing and making ridicule of him—that she had been the instigation of turning him out of his employment on the Monday before—and he said in the scuffle that he was struck first by the deceased GUILTY of Manslaughter only Aged 19 — Transported for Life Fourth Jury before Mr Recorder 
t18380129-652  652 DANIEL MAHONEY PATRICK MAHONEY and THOMAS BRYAN were indicted for the wilful murder of John Bryan they were also charged on the Coroner s Inquisition with the like offence MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution MARGARET DOWNIE I live in Red-cross-alley in the Borough in the parish of St George-the-martyr I remember the day after Christmas-day—I was in the court about a quarter to eight o clock that evening and saw the prisoner Bryan—he lives in the parish—I saw him when he first came into the court—he came by himself—his wife had come before him—I knew the deceased John Bryan and had lived three years next door to him—he had a brother named Jerry Bryan—there had been a quarrel that evening between Jerry Bryan and the prisoner Thomas Bryan and blows passed between them—that was at a quarter to eight o clock—a very few words passed between them and then the blows took place—the women interfered when they were fighting and took Jerry into the deceased s house and after that the prisoner Thomas Bryan went away from the court—he did not say any thing when he went away—he was gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—the court was quiet while he was gone—there was no disturbance then—neither of the Mahoneys were present at the first quarrel—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Thomas Bryan came back and the two Mahoneys with him—Daniel Mahoney was in his shirt sleeves and I think Patrick had his jacket off—Daniel is the son of the other—I did not see any thing in either of their hands at all—when they came Thomas Bryan said Where is e er a b—Bryan now I am not alone now —he said to the elder Mahoney Never mind gossip — that means a person who has stood godfather to a child —Mahoney said he had been listening for a long time and did not know that Bryan his gossip was concerned in it or he would have come— I had told Bryan s wife to go home before that —I said There is no Bryan here to answer you —Thomas Bryan said Never mind gossip I shall see John the Iron either over the bridge or on this side the bridge — the deceased was called John the Iron—he worked at Mr Alderman Thompson s iron-wharf —Thomas Bryan then said Never mind gossip if I do not see him to-night or any of the Bryans I shall meet them over the bridge to-morrow or on this side the bridge or any of his brothers I don t care which it is and I will give them blood to drink or they shall give it to me Q Was there any appearance of any of the Bryans out in the court at that time A No—the prisoners then went away—they went the same way as they came—after they were gone Jerry Bryan the deceased s brother came out of his house into the court and asked who was looking for him—upon which the two Mahoneys returned but not Thomas Bryan—the two Mahoneys came right up to my door—Jerry Bryan was standing under the lamp at my door—the elder Mahoney Patrick came up and shook hands with him very heartily under the lamp by my door and asked him how he did—young Mahoney Daniel also came up the court but I did not hear him say any thing—a young man named Reardon also came up the court and tome others whom I did not know—they went two doors from my house—I did not hear the deceased s wife call out after that—I heard nothing but I heard a row between Jerry Bryan and some of the women at the second door to me where they had gone Q Did you hear anybody on the row taking place call out for the deceased to come out A I did not hear him called out myself but I saw him come out of his brother Patrick s house—not out of his own house— Jerry had been in that house before that the deceased had come out of his own house with his child in his arms and took the child to his brother Patrick s house and when he was called he came out of his brother Patrick s house which is four doors from his own house—I did not hear him called—when he came out of his brother s he went into his own house and came out again—he hardly staid a minute in his own house—when he came out he went down to where the mob was—where the row was going on—it was in the same court—Redcross-alley Q Did you see what he did when be went down there A I heard him saying In the name of God what do you all want here and I saw no more of him till they dragged Jerry Bryan away from the row—presently I saw a kind of clearance and they dragged Jerry Bryan into the deceased s house—I then saw the deceased on the ground and noticed a great quantity of blood come from his head—I did not see any blow struck myself—Mrs Grant and Michael Bryan went to pick him up—Michael Bryan is no relation to him nor to the prisoner Bryan Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Can you tell which of the parties were sober A On my word I think most of them were sober—I know Jerry Bryan was in liquor—I saw the beginning of the row among the women—I did not hear of any disturbance before the one I saw Q How many Bryant live in that court A There are three brothers and a nephew—I cannot say whether the prisoner Thomas Bryan was the worse for liquor—I cannot say that he was much—it was Boxing night—Thomas Bryan went away with the Mahoneys not by himself when they first left—I do not know that Jerry Bryan was taken down the court by the deceased s nephew—I am quite sure about the words Thomas Bryan used when he came back with the Mahoneys— he called out whether there is ever a Bryan here and said If I was alone a while ago I am not alone now and Mr Mahoney said I have heard the disturbance a long time and little did I think it was you there or I would have been here before now and cleared the court —he said Never mind as we cannot find e er a Bryan now I shall find him to-morrow or either of the brothers I don t care which it is I shall give him blood to drink or he shall give it to me —the deceased had come out of his own house first with the child and took it to his brother s house but when he was called out he brought the child back to his own house left it there and went down the court Q What became of you when you heard him say In the name of God what do you all want here A I stood at my own door which is not within four doors of them—I could not see what was going on—it was very dark and I was very ill—there was a row seemingly at the bottom of the court—there were a good many people there—there were none of the other Bryans there that I could see but Jerry Q When the deceased came out of his house and went down to the bottom of the court how many Bryans were there A Jerry and his wife—there was no other Bryan that I could see only Thomas Bryan—I did not see whether the deceased did any thing when he said What in the name of God do you all want here —it was too dark COURT Q HOW long after that did you see the deceased on the ground A Not long it might be a quarter of an hour MR PAYNE Q What occurred between that time you do not know was there any quarrelling and noise during that time A There was MR BODKIN Q Had the deceased any thing in his hand besides the child when he came out A No—he did not speak with any anger at all when he went up and said In the name of God what do you all want here JOHN GRANT I am going on for eleven years old and live with my mother in Redcross-alley I remember last Boxing night—I was standing in the alley on the railing about eight o clock in the evening—I saw the two Mahoneys in the alley—I think they were in their shirt-sleeves—I saw them when they first came up the court—I did not see Thomas Bryan with them—the court was quiet when they came in—Jerry Bryan and Thomas Bryan had been quarrelling before this but Jerry had gone into his house and Thomas Bryan had gone out of the court—he did not live in the court—I did not hear either of the Mahoneys say any thing when they came into the court but I afterward saw young Mahoney with a poker hitting the deceased John Bryan—I did not see him with the poker when he came into the court—I do not know whether he had it or not when I first saw him—I knew the deceased—I saw him come into the court—he came out of his brother s house—he came out of his own house first with his little boy and went into his brother s house with it—about a quarter of an hour after I saw him come out of his brother s house with the child in his arms and go into his own house with the child—I did not see him come out of to his own house again but I saw him afterwards in the court near his own house—I had not heard anybody call before be came out nor before I saw him standing in the court Q What did he do after you saw him standing near his own house A I heard him say to Thomas Bryan s wife You had better go home in peace as Tom Bryan s wife was quarrelling with the deceased s wife—the Mahoneys were not there then—they had not returned— they bad come up once in their shirt-sleeves and gone away again —I did not see the deceased do any thing after the Mahoneys came up the second time—I saw him in the court—I saw young Mahoney come up the court with a poker—the deceased was in his own house then smoking hit pipe—it was after that he came out with his child and went back Q Did you see either of the Mahoneys do any thing to the deceased A Yes I saw the youngest one Daniel hit him on the shoulder with the poker—it made him stagger a little and I saw him Daniel hit him twice more on the head with the poker—he then fell—he was close by the railing at that time and I was standing over him at the tine he was struck Q Before young Mahoney struck the deceased did the deceased strike him or attempt to do so A No I did not see it—I do not think he could have done it without my seeing him where I was—I did not hear them say any thing to each other before the blows wore struck—the deceased had no hat on—he had what is called a Jerry cap which fits close to the head—old Mahoney was standing by while the deceased was being knocked down and after he was down he came and kicked him—he was about as far from the deceased at the time he was knocked down as I am from you— about six yards —I did not hear him say any thing at the time the deceased was being knocked down—he kicked him twice after he was down—he kicked him once first then his wife who was among the women came and kicked him and then he kicked him again—he caught hold of his wife s clothes and kicked him—I did not see in what part of his body he kicked him—the deceased had his cap on while he was on the ground and he had his hands over his head—I did not notice either time where he was kicked—they were not very hard kicks—I did not see any more of the Mahoneys after that for they ran away—I did not see any policeman come—I hallooed out Murder and the Mahoneys ran away—Mrs Williams was at her window at the same time and she called Murder also COURT Q Was it a dark night or not A The lamps were lighted—they are gas lamps but there were a lot of women and men and they took the light away—the lamps did not give much light where this took place—there was light enough for me to be sure that young Mahoney knocked the deceased down with the poker and old Mahoney kicked him—I saw them quite plain—I did not notice what was done with the poker Cross-examined Q Where did the deceased come from at the time you lay young Mahoney struck him with the poker A He came out of his own house and was going into his brother s house—he did not come from the bottom of the court where the disturbance was—he came out of his own house—I was standing on the railing and stood over the deceased when he was struck Q If you stood over him why could you not see where he was kicked A Because it was dark down there—it was more dark on the ground than in any other part—persons were standing between the lamp and young Mahoney and that made it dark—I had been standing on the railing almost half an hour—I did not see the deceased come out of his own house and go down the court where the quarrel was—I was before the Coroner at the first examination—I was not sworn the first day—I was not asked any questions the first day because I did not know the Lord s Prayer—a Catholic priest gave me instructions and then I was sworn—I could not say the Lord s Prayer the first day and I was taught it by the priest—I was never before a Magistrate in my life before—I did not hear any one say Will you see your mother struck —a person named Mary Ann Bryan was in the court—she lives at No 6—she is no relation of the deceased—his wife s name is Peggy I believe—old Mahoney did not say or do any thing while his son struck the blows—he was near to the dark part of the court Q You say he pulled his wife by the gown are you quite sure he did not stumble over the man and kick him by accident A No—he stooped his head—he kicked him about the head I dare say for he kicked towards his head but it was so dark I cannot tell where it was exactly MR BODKIN Q There were people between where you stood and the gas-light A Yes and that made it dark on the ground—I could see the faces of the people but it was dark on the ground ELIZABETH CHARLOTTE WILLIAMS My husband is a tailor I knew the deceased John Bryan—he worked at an iron manufactory I understand—I live at No 4 Red Cross-court or alley—I believe they call it alley—on the day after Christmas-day I was at home in my bed-room on the first floor between nine and ten o clock—it was not ten o clock—I heard a scream of murder and threw up my window—I saw several people fighting together but it was very dark opposite my door—I saw a man in his shirt-sleeves with a heavy weapon in his hand—it appeared a very large poker or an iron-railing—it was very long—I saw him give three different blows but there were five or six people there and I cannot say whether he gave all the blows to one person—my window was not further from them than from me to the Bench— about seven yards —I left my window just to go and put my hand on my child and then returned to it—there then appeared nobody in the court but I saw somebody on the ground and a man in his shirt-sleeves came up and kicked him—I could not tell whether it was a man or a woman on the ground—I saw a man in his shirt-sleeves just come to the body and kick it with his right foot Q Did you see where he kicked it A About the white part of the body—it must have been the upper part of the body because he had a white smock-frock on—I could not tell whether it was the head then not knowing whether it was a man or woman—the man then went past the body a few steps and seized a woman by her gown COURT Q When you first looked out did you see more than one person in shirt-sleeves A I only noticed the person using the weapon—I cannot say whether that was the same person that kicked the body MR BODKIN Q Did you notice whether the man who kicked had the weapon in his hand A No—he had nothing in his hand when he kicked—he seized a woman by the waist and turned round and as he passed again he kicked the body with his left foot—he kicked then on the other side of the body—on the lower part of it—farther from the head—the other persons were gone away then—I saw nobody else in the court—I saw four or five when I looked out the first time or there might be six when the weapon was used but it was in a dark part of the court—I called out that somebody was murdered and then Michael Bryan came up to the body—I saw nobody the last time of looking out but one man and a woman—I stopped to shut the window and while I was doing that I heard them say it was John Bryan the deceased—when I came down he was led away by two policemen—he walked along between them MICHAEL BRYAN I live in Red Cross-alley I knew the deceased John Bryan but am not related to him About eight o clock in the evening on boxing-day I was at my own door in the court and saw the prisoner Thomas Bryan there—I heard him inquiring for John Bryan or any of the Bryans and he said he would serve them so and so that he would jump on any of the Bryans in the court and if he did not catch them then he would have John Bryan as he was going backwards and forwards on London-bridge to his work the deceased used to go over the bridge to work and he said if he did not have help then he would go and bring help that he would bring his gossips from the Back-alley—the Mahoneys—I have been told that the Mahoneys do live in Back-alley—Thomas Bryan then went away and was gone for a quarter of an hour or better—I did not see him return with the two Mahoneys—I know Jerry Bryan the deceased s brother—I did not see him come out of the house but he was at the bottom of the court and was rather in liquor and a great many women had a quarrel down at the bottom of the court—I did not see the deceased there—he was next door to me at his brother s house—I saw him come out with his child in his arms—I do not know what made him come out—at this time the two Mahoneys were down by his house—I followed him down the court—he put his child in doors came out and advised the Mahoneys to go home and to take no notice of women s quarrels as they had begun it to let them finish it betwixt them Q What part of the court were the Mahoneys in when he said that A Close to the deceased s own house—the elder Mahoney then said he would jump on any man who would say any thing against his gossip—at this time Jerry Bryan was rather in liquor and six or seven women got round him and were clawing him opposite the deceased s door—the deceased s wife and I assisted Jerry into the house and got him in doors as he was in liquor—I did not go in doors with him—the two Mahoneys and the deceased at this time were coming up the court talking together—I followed them up and as I came a little towards my own house I saw something white lay against the palings—I had been two doors further up and there were a great many women and people in the way—I did not see any thing done to the deceased but I saw something white against the paling which turned out to be him—he had a white smock frock on—I looked at him and thought it was one of the women and said I would let her stop down a bit as she deserved it having begun the quarrel—somebody said It is John Bryan and then I went to pick him up—I saw a man standing against his head—I looked and it was young Mahoney holding a poker over his head with both hands as if he was going to strike but I did not see any blow struck—it appeared as if he was going to strike me—I said Mind young fellow don t you go to hit me with the poker I have not interfered on either side —I drew back—there was a door open behind me and I got in—I got up on the stairs and remained there two or three minutes and when I thought they were gone I came out—I helped to pick the deceased up and he was taken away by the policemen—I saw no blow struck whatever—I am sure it was young Mahoney had the poker in his hand—I did not notice whether old Mahoney was there—I kept my eye on the poker—the two Mahoneys were in their shirt-sleeves when they first came into the court Cross-examined Q When Thomas Bryan came up with his wife was he in liquor A Both he and his wife were in liquor—that was when he said he would jump on any of the Bryans—this began about eight o clock and kept on till close upon ten o clock—there was not a good deal of quarreling and fighting only Thomas Bryan wanted to get his wife out of the court Q Was there a squabble between Thomas Bryan s wife and the deceased s wife A I do not know—I do not know who was there at the time young Mahoney was going to strike me—I did not look at anybody—I thought to get away from the poker—I cannot tell whether old Mahoney was there then—I did not see either of the Mahoneys strike anybody MARY ANN BRYAN I am the wife of the last witness I saw the two Mahoneys come into the court—they had nothing in their hands—I saw the deceased come out of his brother s house with his child which is two years and a half old—I did not see what became of the child—I saw the deceased talking to the Mahoneys and heard him say that he never interfered with women s quarrels and to go home and be peaceable and quiet—I did not hear them say any thing to that—I saw a man named Reardon striking hands with the deceased and saying he would rather take his part than ill use him—I heard the elder Mahoney say to his son Will you tee your mother struck —the deceased at that time was standing with hit back against the shutter of our window Q Had he struck Mahoney s wife or done any thing of the kind A Not that I saw—I think he could not have done so without my seeing for I was standing close by—I then went into my house and was gone about five minutes—when I came to the door again I saw the elder Mahoney was putting his hands together and he said Be off all of you —the deceased was on the ground at that time and I saw the elder Mahoney kick him on his head—that was after he said Be off all of you —he then took I woman by the clothes and brought her along and as he passed the body he kicked him a second time—I then put my door too and saw no more—I am quite sure the first kick was somewhere about his head—it was not on the shoulder it was on his head towards the upper part—I am quite sure the kick was on some part of the head—it was a violent kick—I cannot say whether the prisoner had boots or shoes on Cross-examined Q How far were you from the man on the ground when he was kicked A He laid opposite No 7 and I live at No 6—I could see by the light of the gas that his head laid on the ground towards where Mahoney s foot went—I can safely say the kicks did not take effect on the shoulder or upper part of the smock-frock—there were no people between the gas lamp and the body that I know of Q On your oath was it not the light darkened by the people who stood between him and the lamp A On that side there was none I am certain—there might be on the other—the lamp is by the door of No 11—I did not see any one standing there with a poker then—there were no person but the elder Mahoney and the woman—I could see the deceased s head—I could see the smock-frock and the dark hair—I cannot say what part of the head it was that was kicked Q How then could you tell it was the head A The smock-frock appeared white and his hair was dark—he had nothing on his head when I picked him up—if he had any thing on his head when he was kicked it must have been the colour of his hair—I cannot say how many people were there when Mahoney said to his son Will you see your mother struck —I know there was the deceased the two Mahoneys Reardon Jerry Bryan snd his wife and my husband and myself—there had been a tumult in the court from about seven o clock and this was about ten o clock but I had bad nothing to do with it MR BODKIN Q Was there light sufficient for you to see that the deceased had a white smock-frock A Yes MR PAYNE Q HOW long were you looking on at this A From the time Thomas Bryan s wife came into the court and asked when Bryan was—I did not see young Mahoney struck at at or down on the ground—there was no fight at all that I saw but I never saw such a quarrel before and I have lived there six years MR BODKIN Q YOU say the deceased had a white smock-frock and his hair appeared dark A Yes—I am quite certain it was on hit head that he was kicked JURY Q Did you see Mrs Mahoney struck A No I did not nor do I think anybody was struck at the time—I did not see toe deceased s wife there at all MARY ANN BRYAN I am the daughter of the deceased I saw nothing of this till I found my father lying on the ground—I did not see either of the Mahoneys there then—I saw some people running and suspecting them I ran after them and found it was the two Mahoneys and his wife—I called out after them and said You murdering villains you have murdered my father —Young Mahoney turned round and lifted up a poker I believe it was and attempted to strike me but his mother said Don t strike the child whatever you do to the father and he did not strike me—I went away into the Borough and called the policemen—my father was not an acquaintance of these people at all that I know of—he was sober that night Q Do you know what occasioned him to go out into the court A Yes I believe Mary Ann Bryan came in and told him something—I did not see her come in—I heard him called out—I heard my aunt Jerry Bryan s wife call to him to come—my father was out at the time and she called to him to come and assist but he did not move then—lit was standing three doors from our house with his back to the window—there was a quarrel going on between Jerry and the women further up the court near to our house a door or two from where my father was—I did not see my father interfere—they brought my uncle Jerry into our house and all the people came in with him leaving my father outside—my uncle was in liquor—what happened to my father when the people went out of the house I do not know Cross-examined Q Had your uncle Jerry been qnarrelling with Mrs Mahoney and other people in the court A Yes—he was brought into our house and the people followed him—my father was outside at that time—he did not come in with the crowd—he was about three doors off when the people brought my uncle in—my uncle s wife asked old Mahoney if he came to hurt her husband and he said he would rather take his part—there was no quarrel between old Mahoney and my father that I know of—I do not think my father ever spoke to them MR BODKIN Q Had your father any weapon in his hand at all A No—he had a black cap on—it was a white flannel cap covered with black glazed stuff and he had a white smock-frock WILLIAM ROBERT BOYD I am assistant to Mr Bransby Cooper of Guy s Hospital I remember the deceased being brought there on the 26th of December—he was alive then and lived till the Thursday week following the 4th of January when he died—he was suffering from a large wound on the left side of the head which was bleeding profusely—there was a contusion on the left temple and a smaller wound near the vertex of the head—he was unable to speak when he was brought in but was conscious of what was being done with him Q I suppose it was a perfectly hopeless case from the first A I should say certainly not as far as we were able to judge when he was brought in—there was not appearance enough to prove a pressure of the skull on the brain—I examined the head after death—on removing the scalp I saw a large quantity of extravasated blood and discovered an excessive fracture without any displacement of the bone—it had extended over a large artery and ruptured that artery and formed a large coagulum of blood which pressing on the brain caused death COURT Q If you had known the state of the wound to be as you found afterwards would you have trepanned A That would not have altered the case—there may be pressure of blood from various causes—trepanning is of use in cases where the pressure is from blood and not from the bone MR BODKIN Q Was it such an injury as was likely to have been inflicted by such an instrument as a poker A Yes I think it very probable that the contusion on the temple might be the result of a kick that alone would certainly not be the cause of death—there was no mark on the shoulder when I examined after death—I did not examine it particularly before—there was no sign of violence on the shoulder after death Q Were the two wounds besides the contusion so situated as that they might be inflicted by one blow A I think it possible they might be inflicted by one blow—they were about two inches or two inches and a half apart Cross-examined Q You consider death was caused by the pressure of coagulum of blood on the brain A Yes that proceeded from the rupture of a vessel which was caused by a large fracture of the skull which I found—that fracture corresponded with the wound outside MR BODKIN Q Would the flow of blood be caused by the contusion on the temple A Not at all WILLIAM CHICHESTER REYNOLDS I am a policeman In consequence of hearing of this affair I went to Mahoney s house in Red Cross-court Borough just in the rear of where the deceased lived—we demanded admittance and were refused—it was between ten and eleven o clock at night—it was boxing-night—I found them in bed when I went in—I told them what I took them for and the younger one said he knew nothing of it—they were undressed but they put their clothes on—I did not see what kind of shoes the elder one had WILLIAM HUMPHRIES I am a policeman I took Thomas Bryan into custody on the night of the 8th of January in Fishmonger s-alley at an Irish wake—he lived there—I had not been looking for him before—I told him what I took him for—he said it was John Bryan s wife s fault—that he knew something about it and it was her fault Cross-examined Q Was not what he said that he had nothing to do with it it was all John Bryan s wife s fault A No he did not say so Cornelius Cronin Catherine Brown of the Maze Borough Ellen Mahoney Michael Mahoney Mary Allen of

t18380402-1089  1089 SIMON MARRIOTT was indicted for the wilful murder of Mary Warner MESSES BODKIN and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution JANE GODWIN I am the wife of Richard Godwin and live at No 15 Red Lion-street Holborn I know the prisoner—I went to lodge in his house on the 14th August st—the house was at No 2 Dolphin-place Holborn—I knew the deceased Mary Warner—I saw her on the first day I went—she appeared to be rather old—I saw her at the kitchen window in front of the house—it is a kind of long window—I believe only one pane opens in it—it looks into a sort of area but I cannot cell it an area it is more like a hole—the window is below the level of the street—when I went there the pane of glass was in—two days after I went to lodge there I heard the deceased crying—I did not speak to the prisoner about it at that time but I did about a week afterwards when I heard her again and his answer was that he was coming to her—I did not hear him go to her then—I heard her cry again and I called him again—she was a few days after the other—on that occasion he went to her—I heard him open the door and speak to her—I did not hear him come out again—I did not hear what he said—I left the house on the 30th of October—I never on any occasion of the prisoner s going to her when she has been crying heard what he has said—the door of the kitchen was in a confused sort of a place—it was always locked—I learnt that by her crying about half-past eight o clock one night—she was screaming Muffer dreadfully crying to be let out—I have seen the prisoner come out and saw him lock the door always when be came out—I went and tried it once and found I locked—on the night she cried Murder I heard her trying to get out—she did not succeed—that was the occasion on which I tried the door and found it shut—I then communicated with the rest of the lodgers—I went into Mr Marriott s house which is No 1—I lived in No 2—the old lady lived at No 2—I went down with them the kitchen and we put a candle through the pane of glass to help her to see herself to bed—it was half-past eight o clock in the evening about the middle of October about a fortnight before I left—there was no light in the kitchen the whole of the time I lived in the house—I never saw any light in the kitchen—I never saw a fire—I had a large Are myself—it was cold at the latter end of August—I lived in the back parlour—when I looked through the window with the assistance of the candle I saw the old lady—she was andressed—she had only her shift and stockings on—I could not see her get into bed because the bedstead was in a corner—the night she was screaming dreadfully I went down stairs and asked her for the key and said You have locked yourself in —she said No I have not —I said You had better give me the key through the door you have locked the door —she said No I have never had a key I have always been locked in since I have been here —I spoke to the prisoner three times on the subject of the old woman and he always sod he was coming—he never expressed himself in any way about the old woman—when he said he was coming I never heard him go to her—I must have seen him if he had gone—I did see him go once but not at the time called him—on one occasion I saw the kitchen door open and heard the prisoner reading something which I believe to be a Bible—on that occasion the deceased appeared contented—I never heard him do any thing to her on any other occasion—a few days after that I heard her crying again—I told the prisoner of it—I did not hear him go into the kitchen then—she got out of the kitchen one day and got stairs to the third floor—the prisoner came to me and said Mrs Godwin have you seen any thing of the old woman —I said no I had not seen her—she went up stairs and he found her on the third floor—when he came down he said What are you doing up here —I did not hear her reply—he said You are too dirty to be seen —she said she could not help it and I heard her crying—I was never in the kitchen—I never saw any of the lodgers except the old woman in it—the door was never open when he candle was put in at the window it was from the area—there was the commonest sort of furniture in the kitchen—she looked round and said why should she be locked up in that hole she had property Mr Marriott had taken her property— my furniture was my own—I believe the prisoner let no furnished lodgings —she said she would rather be in a workhouse than she looked up where she was—I never heard her complain of want of food Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How long before you left was it that this happened about the cry of murder A In the middle of October about a fortnight before I left—Mr Marriott always locked her in the room—asked her for the key one evening not knowing that Mr Marriott had pocked her in—I never saw her with a stick—I cannot say that she was lame—I think she was not—I will not swear it—she stooped a little—there was Mrs Marriott—I never saw Mrs Marriott go to her but once—I was generally at home—I was obliged to go out some times—I was the greatest heart of the time at home—my husband is a lawyer s clerk and he lives at come—he supports me and has a family of three children—I did not tell Mr Marriott of the cry of murder and police and putting the candle into the hole but the lodgers did because they told me so—I never saw Mrs Marriott go to the woman but once—I never looked into the kitchen in the daytime—I never could see the lady—I am not in the habit of going out in the evening—when Mr Marriott found I spoke about the old lady he gave the notice to quit—I never knew any other reason—he did not tell me at the time he gave me notice that it was for bad conduct and that I should not stay in the house any longer—I have seen a Mrs Cruikshanks—she lived in the same house with me—I was examined before the Coroner—I had a large fire in my room at the latter end of August—the cry of Murder and police took place about half-past eight o clock in the evening—it was dark—the old lady was not in bed when we saw her—I did not understand that she had fallen out of bed—I understood that she wanted to get into stopped—she was undressed—I did not tell Mr Marriott of that—I was married at Paris—I have been married seven years to the lawyer s clerk—we were married at St Rolph s chapel—the last situation my husband had in England was in Sergeant s Inn in Fleet-street—I can hardly think of the name of the person he was clerk to there—that was about six months ago—he has been to Belgium—I have not been with him—he went there at the time he left—it was Mr Fiddey he was with—I cannot tell why he left Mr Fiddey—he has been two months at Belgium and is not come back—he left Mr Fiddey about a month before he went to Belgium—I have maintained myself since by his sending backwards and forwards—he was in Belgium when I last heard from him—I cannot say where he is now—I was married by a Catholic priest—I am not a Catholic but my husband is—became acquainted with him in this counter—I might be as well married at Paris as here—we travelled together to Paris and certain parties with us—I cannot say exactly whose employ he was in at the time—be was a lawyer s clerk then—I have no certificate of my marriage with me—it is at home—it is in the French language—I understand very Tittle French—I cannot tell the name of the town in Belgium from which I last heard from my husband unless I had his letter here—I was before the Magistrate—I was not asked for my certificate MR BALLANTINE Q Is there any pretence for insinuating you are not married A Not that I know of—there were other lodgers in the house besides me—I do not know of their complaining to the prisoner of the ill-treatment received by the old woman—I know that the other lodgers left but why I cannot tell—one left before me—she was not sent out of the house because she was a nuisance—she gave the prisoner notice and he gave her notice after that I believe—I did not give him notice—he gave me notice—he did not say why—he desired me to stop a few days if I was not suited MARTHA SMITH I am single I now live at No 15 Quicksett-row New-road In April 1837 I went to lodge at No 1 Dolphin-place—I did not know the deceased by name—I know an old woman lived in the house—I saw her the night she was brought there which was about a month or six weeks after the time I went to live there—I saw her in the passage with Mrs Marriott—she occupied the back parlour of the house No 2—I should say she occupied it not more than three weeks or a month at the most—after leaving the back parlour she went into the front kitchen—I was in it the day it was prepared for her reception—there was furniture brought the night she came—she was brought to No 1 at first—that was the night the furniture was brought—I do not know How much furniture there was—I believe some part of it was sold—I have seen the prisoner cleaning up furniture for sale—I do not know whether that was part of the furniture that was brought in for her—I did not see furniture at all—it was brought in the night—there was no furniture is the kitchen subsequent to the day I saw it—I cannot say whether she went into it that night or the next day—Mrs Marriott said it was being prepared for her reception—I saw her in it the same week—I never heard the prisoner or his wife talking to Mrs Warner—I never heard her name till after her death—I left on the 14th and she died on the 19th—I used to ask after her as the old lady—he and his wife used to tell me repeatedly that she was well and better than I was—I lived there from April till the 14th of February this year—at the time I left the old lady was alive—the servant has been standing at the door and Mrs Warner has walked about Dolphin-place and talked to me—for five months before her death I never saw her out of her room—I have spoken to her in the kitchen before Mrs Marriott—about the middle of October I was sitting in the parlour occupied by Mrs Robinson in the house No 1—there came repeated knocks at the door for Mr Marriot—they were not answered by him—be was not in the house at the time nor his wife—we went to the door and I went with Mrs Godwin—Mrs Warner was screaming Murder and trying to get out—the entrance to the kitchen is from the area of the house No 1 over a sink—you might go from the house No 2—when I heard the scream Mrs Robinson and Mrs Godwin went through to the door out of the area with a candle—I staid above—I went to the gate to try and find a policeman to come but I could not see one—the old lady came to the window—she said that she had got out of bed and could not get in again and she wanted to get away from there—there was no fire in the room and she had no light and it was about half-past eight o clock at night—she said they had got her clothes—she did not mention names—she said they had got her clothes and furniture—all she seemed to want was to get away—I was absent part of the time while Mrs Robinson was holding the light—I have spoken to the prisoner about the old lady—I was cleaning a few knives and forks once and the servant came and locked the door of the kitchen and jumped over the place where I was standing which is where the sink is where they ger over—I saw Fillingham the servant lock the door and bring the key—the prisoner was standing at the sink of his own house by the kitchen-door—I said How dull that poor old soul must be shut up in a kitchen after being used to a house to range about in —he said How do you know she has been used to a house to range about in —I said From what you said yourself —he said It would be much better for you to mind your own business and I said no more—I have seen the prisoner take food to the old lady three or four times—when I first saw the old lady she appeared remarkably well and her spirits very good—I should say I had not teen her for six weeks or two months before I left the house—she then appeared remarkably dejected and very much neglected and dirty—she begged of me on one occasion to come down stairs and comb her hair—during the time the servants were there the first servant in particular she appeared always clean—that was the time she was living in the back parlour—I have been in the kitchen—there was nothing there but a dresser and fire-grate when I saw it Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Do you know where the station-house is in your district A No—I have an idea of course—I have seen a policeman in the streets—I did not complain to the police that the poor creature was cruelly treated—I did not think she was treated kindly being locked up—I thought it cruel—I must say I did think she was cruelly treated—I mentioned it to Mr Bernescol hoping be would mention it—I knew if I mentioned it I should get into disgrace—I mentioned it to all my friends—I left it to others to mention it to the police—I did not tell the prisoner about hearing the cry of murder—it was after I had been told to mind my own business—she wanted then to get out of the place—she had a bed-gown on and appeared as if she had been to bed—she was exceedingly excited and was crying dreadfully—she wanted to get out—she was bettering the door with a stick—she was soothed after we had been there about half an hour Q Was she an infirm old lady A She walked without assistance—I have seen her walk on more occasions than one up and down Dolphin-place but not for five months previous to my leaving—the weather has been very severe this winter—I have been in the habit of asking after the old lady and the prisoner used to say Why my dear she is better than yon —my health has been very good—I am twenty-four years old—I think she was seventy-four—it is as much as five months since I have seen her—my uncle and sister were living at the same place—I do not live there now—they live there still but are going to leave—they would not have stopped so long if they could have got apartments to suit—I left on the 14th of February—I had a few words with my uncle and I said we had better part friendly than unfriendly—I am now residing with a friend in the New and—a married woman who has a family—my sister is living with my uncle at present—I never was out but on one occasion after twelve o clock and then I went to the theatre—the quarrel was not about my being out late—my uncle is sometimes out and sometimes at home—I do not follow any business—I did then—I did work both at home and out—I was more frequency out than at home in the daytime but I was mostly at home at meals in—I do not wish to insinuate that the old woman had not above three males in ten months—I have known both Mr and Mrs Marriott take her food—when I heard the cry of murder I told my uncle of it when he came home but he is a dreadfully nervous man and I dared not interfere on that account—told him a few things that I had seen but not all—my sister was away from home—she was away for months together—what has happened has always been when my sister has been away I suppose—I did tell her and she said I had better not interfere in it I should get into anger with my uncle—that was the reason why I did not mention it to the police—there were other persons that took it up as well as me—I partly supported myself by needlework—before the deceased occupied the kitchen it was occupied by another lodger—I do not know How long the lodger had left it—it was a room which had been occupied—I have been in the kitchen—I cannot say whether it was eighteen feet long—it is a boarded kitchen—by the window it is light but by the fire it is dark—it is a large window by which the light comes in two ways to the room—it is angular—if there was a screen to the window a person outside could not see the fire—I have never been into the back parlour which the deceased had before she went to the kitchen—I have been in the front parlour over the kitchen—there are two kitchens—I do not know How many lodgers there were when the old lady was there—the house was full—they had one common place to go to get water—in order for the lodgers to get water it was necessary for them to pass the door of the kitchen where she was—on one occasion she asked me to comb her hair—I did not do it—when the door was locked How could I do it Q Although the door was locked she was in that state of mind to ask you to comb her hair A She wished for assistance—there were two servants one after the other—I should say I saw her last full two months before this happened—it might have been in January—the furniture came in the evening—I do not know who bought or paid for it MR BALLANTINE Q Up to the time the old lady went to live in the kitchen had her conduct been quiet and peaceful A As far as I know—I never before that time heard her call out murder or complain of being under restraint—I have had conversations with her before that and at different times and she answered very sensibly indeed—I do not know whether there was a door between the areas when I first went—persons have no occasion to go into the area at all to get to the kitchen—there was not a kitchen of the same kind in our house—it was a square kitchen there—Mr and Mrs —resided there—that kitchen was carpeted—I cannot say whether there was any carpet in the kitchen where the old lady was ELIZABETH KERLEY I am—the wife of John Kerley and live at No 20 Carlisle-street I lived in Dolphin-place about twelve months—I went in September and left last September—I have seen Mrs Warner—I saw her first at the beginning of the summer—I recollect her coming about the month of June—she then lived in the back-parlour and continued to live there about a month or six weeks—I cannot recollect the time—I knew the kitchen she lived in subsequently—I have been in it myself—I never was in it after the deceased was there—it was not carpeted before—I have seen the deceased in the passage often going into the kitchen—I remember her going into the kitchen—the door was always locked—sometimes Mr Marriott had the key and sometimes the servant Ann Price—I do not know the name of the other servant—there were two servants—I never heard her name—she always locked the door—I never heard Mr Marriott tell her to lock it after her—I have heard the deceased complain of being kept in the kitchen and ask why she was made a prisoner of—she once showed me a dry piece of bread—a person stood by the said of me—I asked her if she had not enough—she said it was too dry she could not eat it—it did appear to be very dry—I only saw it through the window—I never could get in—I never had any conversation with Mr Marriott about it—I have called to him when she has been crying for assistance—on one occasion he attended to the call but it was an hour after—I had once some conversation with the old lady—I thought her replies perfectly sensible—there was nothing that I observed peculiar in her conduct—I never saw candles in the room—I could not get into my room without passing her window—if there had been a candle in the room I must have seen it—I never saw a candle in the room—I lived in the same house with her—we all cooked for ourselves Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What part of September did you leave A I think it was about the 16th—we did not want candles very early—I am married—my husband is a stage-coachman—I went by my own name in the house—I never went by the name of Heath—that is my mistress s name—she never lived there—my husband is now driving the Wickham coach—I left Mr Marriott because my husband s business led ns to the West-end—I gave notice a fortnight previous to Mr Marriott giving me notice—my husband was then going to drive an omnibus and it was more convenient to leave—I cannot recollect when the deceased showed me a piece of bread—it was not while Ann Price nor while the other servant was living there—I never said the old lady was being starved to death—I certainly do not say that now—I could hold a conversation with her through the window—it is a large window that throws a great deal of light into the room—the fire-place was opposite the door—I do not know whether it was a comfortable room as I never went into it MR BALLANTINE Q I understand you never could get into it to see A No not after the old lady went into it—I talked to her once at the window—she was calling out for Mrs Kelly—my name being Kerley I went down to speak to her thinking she had made a mistake—I went to live there in September 1836—this rent-book which I have was made out in Mr Marriott s handwriting I think at first—I received it from him—it is headed Mrs Kerley —I have passed by the windows when it was so dark that candles were required and there were none—I did not think she was well treated—I have heard her cry for an hour together for assistance—I never had conversation with her enough to judge whether her conduct was such as to justify her confinement—when I saw her before she got into the kitchen her conduct was quite quiet and rational in my opinion ELIZABETH ROBINSON I am the wife of George Robinson We live at No 1 Dolphin-court—we were both living thereat the time the old lady in question was living there—we went to live there on the 1st of August last—at that time I believe Mrs Warner was living in the kitchen—on one occasion Mrs Godwin mentioned something to me—in consequence of that I went to the kitchen window where Mrs Warner was—she was calling murder and shaking the door violently—I desired Mrs Godwin to fetch a policeman—I said to Mrs Warner Has any one a key that will open the door —I endeavoured to pacify her—she said They have got me here and all my good clothes and things and see here look at this Place when I have got so much good furniture of my own —I did not Particularly notice How the place was furnished but it did not appear comfortable—I was looking through the window—I put a candle through a square of glass that was out— this was in the month of October —there was no means of closing the square—it appeared taken out of the frame—I said How is it you are here have you no friends have you no nieces she said No —I said Have you any neighbours or friends tell me and I will go or write to them however great the distance —she said No no they will not interfere —I tried to pacify her—I lived there the whole winter—I passed the window when I came home but it was but seldom—I passed it once a week at least—I never saw a spark of light there—when I came home in the evening I tapped at my bed-room window for my children to let me in and I could see the kitchen window—I know now where the fire-place is—if there had been any fire I must have seen it quite plainly—during the whole of the winter there was no fire in the room not even a glimmering light Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q It was but seldom you passed the window A Not above once a week—I live in the parlour and com across to tap for my children to open the door—that is when I have passed her window and sometimes I have gone on purpose Q Are you prepared to swear that during the severe weather there was a not a screen before the window A I saw nothing but dark—there was a green curtain—I do not know whether that would prevent my seeing or not—I think the cry of murder must have been in the middle of October—Godwin fetched me—Smith was there on the same occasion—the deceased wanted to get out—I did not hear her say that she had got out of bed and could not get in again—I was so excited I cannot tell what she said—she was out of bed—she might complain that she had got out of bed and could not get in again—I will not swear that she did or not—I rather believe she did—I saw her—I did not notice whether she was in her night dress—she might have it on and I not notice it—I only looked through a window—after a time we succeeded in soothing her and she got into bed—when we asked about her friends she named one person but said they would not interfere MR BALLANTINE Q Had you other opportunities besides when you passed the window to observe whether or not there was a fire in the room when you stood at your own window to tap to get in could you see into the room A Yes sometimes—that might be two or three times in a week and sometimes not for a fortnight or three weeks together—I had not occasion to do so often about Christmas that I know of—when I held the light to the window there was no screen in the room—the court is not a thoroughfare—there are three houses in it—they all belong to Mr Marriott MR PAYNE Q Which house do you live in A No l—it is quite full of lodgers ELIZABETH TURNER I know the houses belonging to Mr Marriott in Dolphin-place—I was one of the lodgers there—I took the apartments at No 2 in March 20 1837 and left on the 17th of May the same year—I remember Mrs Warner coming there—there was a van of goods come about an hour before—I do not know whether those goods were Mrs Warner s—I never heard Mr Marriott say any thing about them—they were taken to No 1—she was taken to No 2—I left in May Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was there a screen in the room A In Mrs Warner s room there was MR BALLANTINE Q What room A The back parlour in which she was first placed—I was there when she was taken into the kitchen—she was taken first to the back parlour and then down to the kitchen—she was an invalid and was assisted down by Mrs Marriott—the kitchen was not so comfortable as the room she was taken from—I do not know what became of the screen after she left the parlour ABRAHAM CARTER I live at No 31 Paradise-terrace Holloway On the 8th or 9th of March 1837 I called on Mrs Warner in Cannon-street at the former Mrs Reed s house who was a sister to Mrs Warner—I had known them a number of years—I always understood that it was rented by Mrs Reed—I know from passing the lease into the hands of a gentleman named Wood that the value of it was full 200l —Mrs Reed was not dead then—she died about the 6th or 7th of March—that was after I was sent down there—when I called on Mrs Warner on the 8th or 9th of March Mrs Reed was dead—I saw Mrs Warner on that occasion and had some conversation with her—she appeared in very good health and very good faculties—her spirits were good—I never saw her in the house in Dolphin-place Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When you saw her did she say her sister had made her will and left her executrix A Yes—I asked her to let me see it—she said Mr Marriott had got it and the lease also—she did not say he had got them with her consent—she did not tell me he had taken the lease away with her consent—she mentioned nothing of that—I saw her again the next morning—she told me the same night that she would get it for me if I wanted to see it—I went the following morning—the then said Mr Marriott would save me the trouble of interfering in the business—she gave me Mr Marriott s compliments and he would take all the trouble

BALLANTINE Q Do you know whether Mr Marriott was related to her at all A I believe not I cannot say positively ELIZA LUCK I am a charwoman I know the house in Dolphin-place—I knew it from April last year down to February in this year—I attended to the lodgers and worked for two ladies in the house No 2 in which Mrs Warner lived—she lived in the kitchen and in the parlour at first—I was never in the parlour while she was there—I remember her living in the kitchen—I once or twice heard her making a noise and she told me to let her out and said it was very cold—I asked her if she had any fire and she said she had no fire she had only had fire twice while she was there—she told me this about December or January—when I was talking to her the weather was cold—it was that induced me to ask her—I was outside the room—I could not get in then—I did get in once—the door was locked—she told me there was no fire—I was not able to see that myself—I looked through the window once in the cold weather and there was no fire—I saw a screen that was standing so as to prevent a view of the fire-place—it was something like a shutter—it was before the fire-place—I could not see the grate—I did not see into the room when she said she had no fire—when I spoke to her it was through the key-hole—it was a kind of wooden screen—it was close to the grate to the best of my knowledge—it was not as a cloak to the chimney but a cloak to the grate—it was close against the grate so that I could not see it—I cannot tell whether it was touching the grate—it was large enough to screen the grate—I looked particularly to see if there was any fire and I could not see any—if there had been a fender before the fire-place the screen would prevent my seeing that—it was a kind of board or fire-screen put against the fire-place—I do not know whether it stood by itself—I could not see any fire if there had been one I suppose I should have seen it—the screen was placed up against the fire-place—when I went into the kitchen it was very damp Q How did you get in A Mr Marriott once took the lady some bread and butter and tea or something in a mug—I wanted to go in to see whether she had any fire—I had spoken to her—it had been reported she was not quite right in her head—I said to Mr Marriott Oh dear poor creature she is childish and she said she was not nor out of her senses—that was when I went into the kitchen Q How had you got in A I was down at the sink doing some work and I saw the prisoner open the door and go in and I went in after him—I am quite sure he unlocked the door and I followed him in—I saw the fire-place then and looked at it very particularly—that was when I saw the screen—if there had been a fire in the room I must have observed it—one side of the wall near the dresser was very damp—it was cold weather in December or January—it was December to the best of my knowledge—when I got into the room I observed the walls were damp—I did not touch them—I could see damp on the walls near the dresser—the other part did not seem so damp—there was not much furniture in the room—there was no carpet that I could see—it was not such a place as any of the lodgers lived in—it was not so comfortable—I had several opportunities of seeing her while I worked there—I have seen her many times through the window sitting on a chair looking very disconsolate—nobody was with her or attending to her that I saw—she cried very much and wanted me to let her out—to the best of my knowledge that was not above twice but she often called to me saying Is that Mr or Mrs Marriot and saying that she wanted her tea Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Were you examined before the Coroner A No nor before the Magistrate—I have known the houses in Dolphin-place nearly three years—a Mrs Benson lived in the kitchen before Mrs Warner—I cannot say How long but not long—Mrs Jolly lived there but she did not sleep there—she used to cook there—a Mr Banyon did not occupy it that I know of—it is a boarded kitchen with a large window—I cannot exactly say whether the screen was a chimney-board that fitted in close but the grate was disguised—I did not go up to it—it stood between me and the

belief—I heard Mrs Marriott in there with her once—I worked for Mrs Wells and Mrs Lefroy—Mrs Lefroy lives there now on the second floor—Mrs Wells is not there now—to the best of my knowledge it was in December when I went into the room RODERICK NEIL I live at No 16 Brook-street Holborn and am a twopenny postman On the 21st of February last I took a letter directed to Mrs Warner to No 1 Dolphin-court or place—a female opened the door to me—from what passed with the female I did not leave the letter—I did not think her old enough to give me a decisive answer and I called the following morning after eight o clock—the prisoner then opened the door half way to me but I can recognise his face—I asked if Mrs Warner lived there and he said The letter has been round twice I thought you had a decisive answer not to take it round the third time —I had intrusted another man to deliver it previously—when I asked if Mrs Warner lived there he said No —I returned the letter through the Post-Office in the ordinary way under cover to the writer—I asked the prisoner if he could give me the address and I would have the letter forwarded to her—he said be did not know her—he denied knowing any thing of her—I asked if she had ever lived there—he said no he never knew her Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What time was this when you asked him if she had ever lived there A After eight o clock the following morning the 22 nd—I have heard since that she had been dead two days at that time—I am quite certain about what he said—I did not write it down—his answer was that he thought I had received sufficient answer not to take it round a third time—my partner had written on it Not known as directed Dolphin-court High-Holborn MR BALLANTINE Q Did he say one single word about Mrs Warner lying dead in the house A He did not JIMSS WOOD I reside at No 6 Sebbons-buildings Islington I knew the deceased Mrs Warner—I have a letter which I wrote to her— producing it —it was returned to

not—I had a demand of money on Mrs Warner MR BALLANTINE Q Do you know anything about the letter produced A It is my writing—I do not know the date of it SARAH CRUIKSHANK I am the wife of Robert Cruikshank and live at No 34 Cannon-street City Some day previous to the 10th of October I went with my husband to No 1 Dolphin-court—I there saw the prisoner and his wife—Mr Marriott asked me to write an agreement about the house No 34 Cannon-street of which Mr Cruikshank was to take the upper part—I heard the prisoner mention the name of Mary Warner to his wife—he spoke in an indistinct tone—I could hear nothing more than the Name of Mary Warner—Mrs Marriott dissented to what he said whatever it was and he again repeated it to her and she again dissented—I asked the prisoner what interest Mrs Warner had in the house and he said None whatever —he asked me if I remembered a conversation he had with me respecting the decease of Mrs Reed—I told him Perfectly well —he said did I not remember he had told me at Mrs Reed s decease that Mrs Warner was her sister—I inquired in what way Mrs Warner could be a party to the agreement—his reply was None whatever —he said something about her not being capable of undergoing the fatigue that at her advanced age she was quite incapable—that he had been accustomed to let lodgings—there was an agreement ultimately signed—I produce it—it is not stamped—after it had been signed I inquired whether Mrs Warner was a relative as he seemed to take such an interest in her affairs—he said None at all —he said respecting the house in Cannon-street Mrs Warner having been accustomed to let lodgings he had taken the lease of the house of the Pewterers Company on condition of paying up as arrear of rent that they had given him four years to pay it by three instalments 20l of which he had paid in consideration of which he had undertaken keep Mrs Warner comfortable as long as she lived—I wished to purchase some of the furniture and he said I might make my own selection—he did not say to whom it belonged—I understood it was his own property—he did not speak of it as anybody s property but his own—he appointeda Mr Kelly to value the furniture in the house in Cannon-street to Mr Cruikshank and a Mr Phillips was appointed to value it for us—the amount of the valuation was 37l within a few shillings—that has not been paid—we were to pay it to Mr Marriott Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When the name of Mary Warner was mentioned and Mrs Marriott shook her head did the prisoner say Yes yes better A He did—the name of Mary Warner was put in the agreement because Mr Marriott asked me to do so—I will swear he said he had taken the house of the Pewterers Company and was to pay 60l arrears of rent and had paid one instalment of 20l —at the time he said she was no relation of his he said she was a townswoman of his—I have heard the prisoner say that Mrs Mason had been living in the house since Mrs Warner left it and that she had unfortunately got into the King s Bench prison—I cannot say at what time I heard it—I had every reason to suppose from what passed that the furniture was his—I lived at Dolphin-place for a few days once—I told Mr Marriott it was different to what I expected and it did not suit me—I complained that there were persons in and out at night and it disturbed me—I do not recollect that I complained of any particular person—I really cannot say where the lodgers lived who came in and out there were so many persons in the house—I lived there a few days previous to the 10th of October MR BALLANTINE Q While you were living there did you see Mrs Warner at all A I saw her but was not at all aware who she was until her death—I saw her in passing by a window which looks into an are—I did not notice in what state she was but I recollect she had on a black gown JOHN GREEN TOWERS I am clerk to the Pewterers Company I am aware of what leases are made by them—no house or premises belonging to the Company would be taken without my knowledge—there was never any premises in Cannon-street let to the prisoner—he never at any time took a lease in any shape from the Pewterers Company—he has paid two instalments of 11l 15s each for arrears of rent due from Mrs Reed—he paid it as her executor—he so stated Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Was there not a petition sent in on the part of Mary Warner the sister of Mrs Reed to let her off the arrears in consideration of her long tenancy A There was a memorial sent in in the name of the prisoner—he stated his object to be to serve Mary Warner—the prayer of the petition was not acceded to—he made himself answerable for the amount COURT Q Did he give a written agreement A He signed a memorandum which I have here MR PAYNE Q What time was the petition presented A The 8th of April last year—I think Mrs Reed died in February or the beginning of March—I have no recollection of a Mr Mason of the Custom-house making an application on behalf of Mrs Warner MR BALLANTINE Q Did you sec Mrs Warner at all when this house was the subject of conversation A I saw her once after the death of Mrs Reed but not on this petition—I believe it was before it was presented JAMES FORD I am a clerk in the Prerogative Office I produce the original will of Ann Reed—the personal property is sworn under 100l —I am not able to tell the value of the premises—our act of Court states there was no executor or residuary legatee—Mrs Warner is named in the will as sister and next of kin The will was here read it was dated the 26th of March 1836 bequeathing to Mary Warner all the effects and the lease of the house in Cannon-street —Witness S MARRIOTT MR DOANE Q These are letters of administration granted to Mrs Warner by your Court A Yes—when a person takes out letters of administration it is necessary to give two securities—the securities here are C Cresswell and Simon Marriott—they enter into a bond for the proper administration of the effects—I cannot tell who paid the expenses of taking out these letters—it does not appear to have been taken out by commission and therefore Mrs Warner must have personally appeared—the letters were granted the 20th of July 1837 CHALES REEPE I live at No 31 Aucit-street Lambeth Mrs Warner s sister was my grandfather s second wife—I remember the death of Mrs Reeves—I went to her funeral and saw the prisoner there—after the funeral he called me on one side and asked me if I should have any objection to pay for my cloak and my sister s and brother s also as he did not wish to put Mary Warner to any expense he should pay for his—he told me he was left executor—he showed me about a quarter of a sheet of writing paper as a will and told me he had found it by mere chance lying down on the ground—J observed Mrs Warner was much grieved and took a chair and sat down by the side of her and told her she should come and live at home with me and I would make her happy and comfortable for the remainder of her life—her reply was that it was a kind offer certainly—the prisoner said No no sir she shall go home and live along with me as you are no relation whatever —I asked him what relation he was—he said he was a townsman and that he had buried Mrs Reeves s niter and it was Mrs Reeves s wish that he should bury her too in fact that be was executor—he said Mrs Warner is going home to live along with me until affairs are settled and I will make her happy and comfortable Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did you ever go to make inquiry after Mrs Warner A I asked Mr Marriott to give me his address—he did so and I gave it to my sister who promised to go and see her but she by chance lost it—I called at the house in Cannon-street and inquired for the address but was not able to get it—I did not find her—I first came forward to give evidence at Bow-street—not before the Coroner—it was after I saw in the newspapers that some money was found in a box and saw Mr Marriott s name mentioned MR BALLANTINE Q Have you an interest in any money found in a box A None JOHN LLEWELEN I occupy the ware-house parlour kitchen and cellar of the house No 34 Cannon-street and pay rent for it to the prisoner 55l a year—I paid him one quarter s rent last Christmas Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q You did not pay taxes A No the rent is exclusive of taxes SAMPSON SWENDELL I live at No 7 Drury-lane and am an undertaker On the 20th of February I was employed by Mr Target an undertaker to take a coffin to No 2 Dolphin-court—I there saw the prisoner and his wife—they went with me into the front kitchen—I there found the corpse of a female lying on a board—I took it from the board and placed it into the coffin—when we took it off the board it laid with the knees bent out—that is caused by a body not being laid out properly—it had the appearance to me as though it had died through want—it was in a kitchen below stairs—there was not much furniture in it—there was no carpet and no bed—there was a tent bedstead but no fire-irons no coals nor any appearance of fire which made me consider there was very little comfort for a poor old soul to lay there—I had difficulty it placing the body in the coffin from the position it was in—I could not get the knees down—I was going to put a nail into the coffin to keep the knees down but I did not and covered it with a cloth—the prisoner was there part of the time Cross-examined Q Did you afterwards go with Mr Target on the day of the funeral A I did—I formed an opinion of the person having dieds from starvation from the external appearances ANN PRICE examined by MR PAYNE I went to live servant with Mrs Warner in Cannon-street after the death of her sister Mrs Reeves—Mr Marriott engaged me—I remained in Cannon-street a month or six week I went from there to Dolphin-court at the same time as Mrs Warner—I lived there rather more than two months—I was examined before the Coroner—I gave evidence before Mr Minshull at Bow-street—I was bound over at Bow-street to appear here and give evidence—when Mr Warner first went to Dolphin-court she lodged in the back-parlour of No 2 and remained there three weeks or a month—at that time the kitchen floor was occupied—after that she was removed into the kitchen below—she did not object to it—there was a bedstead there and two feather beds on it—during the time I was there I took her meals down to her—it was bread and butter and tea for breakfast and meat and potatoes for dinner and bread and butter and a drop of beer for supper—it was pretty good beer—I had the same—it was good meat that she had—I had my dinner with her—I took her out to walk once or twice a week while I was there—I took her out to church on Sundays—Mr Marriott went into the kitchen on Sunday evenings to read to her—his conduct to her was generally kind—she was lame and she used a stick—she used to be assisted by my arm when she walked out—I did not think she was quite right in her head at times—when I was not with her I used to lock the door—Mrs Marriott used to go to her at times—she was not fit to go out by herself—she used to say sometimes that she could at more food than she had—that was only now and then—she had all her usual meals during the time I was there COURT Q How long were you there A About two months MR BALLANTINE Q How long had she been in the room in the area before you left A About five weeks I should think—I was there rather more than three months in all—about two months in Dolphin-place—the old lady was in the back parlour about three weeks or a month HENRIETTA FILMNGHAM examined by MR PAYNE I succeeded Ann Price in waiting on Mrs Warner—I used to take her to church and to take her food—I had my meals with her—I remained there five weeks—she had plenty of wholesome food during the time I was there—we some times disagreed—I took her out for a walk—I left Mr Marriott because I and Mr Warner could never agree—she said she did not want a servant and could do better without one than with me MR BALLANTINE Q When did you leave the service A On the 30th July WILLIAM HUGHES I am a surgeon residing at No 90 High-Holborn on the evening of the 26th of February last I went to the kitchen of the house No 2 Dolphin-place and found the dead body of a female lying in a coffin—I looked at the body and then returned to the Coroner s jury—I subsequently made a post-mortem examination—on the view I had of it first it presented an appearance of great emaciation as if she had died from some lingering disease or from starvation—on the same day I made a post-mortem examination—the immediate cause of death was water on the brain—I cannot tell what that was produced by—it might have been the conesquence of disease but I found no disease except water in the centre of the brain—that is sometimes the effect of inflammation in younger subjects and dometimes the effect of great exhaustion—it may be caused by some disease or by extreme exhaustion—we call inflammation disease—any thing may produce inflammation of the brain may produce effusion of water on the brain—I found no disease in the brain sufficient to produce this water—there was only a very slight appearance of inflammation of the membranes or what I should call lymph thrown up on the membranes of the brain which is sometimes I believe present without inflammation Q If it does not arise from inflammation to what other cause can you attribute the appearances A To great exhaustion—or excitement may produce it also—it is my opinion that there was no disease apparent that could cause this—there was very great emaciation of the body and the stomach and bowels were empty and were collapsed—the heart also was empty that is there was a very small quantity of blood in it not the quantity we usally find in post-mortem examinations Q What in your opinion did that emaciation arise from A It is imPossible to answer that question decidedly—it might arise from a want of a proper quantity of food—I am not aware of any thing else—we see that emaciation when death happens from diseased lungs but here the lungs were healthy—water in the brain may be called a disease but it is more the effect of disease COURT Q Was it that inflammation being there the result of the inflammation was water A Yes when the water comes the inflammation ceases—there are at times besides water other appearances to show there has been inflammation such as large quantities of lymph MR BALLANTINE Q If there had been such inflammation as to cause if scretion of water would there be appearances of that left A I should think so and such inflammation must occasion pain but what pain depends on what we call acute or chronic—I think that is such a disease as would require the attendance of medical men—death could not be caused by such a disease without there being the appearance of indisposition—it my opinion that the secretion of water was caused by exhaustion—had all the appearances of being an old woman—I think that remaining for days and nights in a room without fire of any kind would be productive of injury to a woman of her age—I saw the kitchen in which her body was—I did not much notice the place but without a fire I should say it was not fit for anybody to remain in with such weather as we have had last winter—the exposure in such a room might destroy life first by producing excitement and then exhaustion—confinement in any room of a person against their will might produce it more especially a woman in her reduced state and at her age Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q I suppose by emaciation you mean there was scarcely any flesh to the body but the skin adhering to it A Yes as complete a state of emaciation as ever I saw as if in the last stage of consumption—that is not often the case with old persons unless they have some organic disease—if there was an effusion of water on the brain produced by exhaustion there might not be some appearance of effusion of water in other parts—I will not swear there would not be—excitement is usually followed by great exhaustion—I am quite certain death was caused by water on the brain—I am not quite certain that water on the brain must have been produced by exhaustion—by exhaustion I mean that state of collapse which you see after great excitement—I may explain further by saying when a person has lost a large quantity of blood that will produce exhaustion and death a diminished supply of blood not sufficient to support life—emptiness of the intestines might probably be produced by other causes than withholding food—I found no cause on examination sufficient to account for the emptness of the stomach—vomiting for some time before death may account for it or other causes—there are cases of disease for instance stricture in the throat but that would be visible—I never met in my practice a case in which water in the brain was produced by want of food—I never read in the course of my medical education any case to that effect MR MBALLANTJNE Q In your experience you never met with a person starved to death A Never—the appearances on all parts of the body betokened the want of proper food and nourishment MR PAYNE Q Can you tell us whether the state of the body did or did not betoken an incapacity to derive nourishment from food A No it did not—I found no disease—that is the only thing that would incapacitate the person who had food offered to them MR BALLANTINE Q From the appearance of the stomach could the person have taken any food within a reasonable time A Not within some hours previous to death—I should say twelve hours—I saw the body in the kitchen—there were no marks of vomiting pointed out to me—she had been dead a week when I examined her JOHN GREEN TOWERS re-examined The lease of the house in Cannon-street has about eight years to run—the rent is 50l a year—I do not know what the taxes are—there have been some repairs

t18381126-90  90 JOHN ROBERTSON and ELLEN COLLINS alias Smith were indicted for the wilful murder of Edmund Taylor MESSRS CLARKSON and HORRY conducted the Prosecution MARY BROWN I knew the deceased Edmund Taylor—he was about twenty-two years of age On Saturday night the 29th of September about ten o clock I saw him by the Paviours Arms Ratcliff-high way—I saw him again about one o clock on Sunday morning in Bluegate-fields—he appeared pretty sober then—he had been drinking a little but I do not think he was intoxicated—he told me he had been fighting—I went to have something to drink with him at the Bluegate-public-house—we were there about five minutes and had some gin—I came up Bluegate-fields with him—I had my pattens on—he stood talking to a woman named Macey who lives next door to the prisoner Collins s house—I went up to the top of the street leaving him talking to the woman—he came up to me again and we went to the Coach and Horses night-house Ratcliff-highway—it was then between two and three o clock—we had some more gin there—we went from there down Shakspeare s-walk—it was very dry there he said he would carry my pattens and I gave them to him to carry—when we got to the top of Shakspeare s-walk I met Ellen M Carthy—she is the same description of person as I am—I then bid Taylor good night leaving my pattens with him as I forgot them—when I passed Collins s house I saw a man sitting at her door with her but cannot say who it was—I saw Charles Stiles standing by Collins s window and she said to him Come here Charley I want you and I said the same—he went with Collins into her house—the other man still remained at the door—Collins directly after came back without Stiles and having a knife in her hand with a white handle—I cannot say whether it was a clasp or a table-knife—she walked about eight or nine times before the door and said she would stab the first b-r that came a nigh her or her man should-those were the exact words-her man was standing by her at the time the same man who had been sitting by her—I had had a few words with her about a fortnight before but not at that time Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Was Stiles the man she alluded to A No it was him she called into her place—when she said her man should Stiles was inside—she did not say which man she meant—we had not made our quarrel up at that time MR CLARKSON Q Do you know what is meant by a fancy man A No—the expression she used was if she did not her man should—I have not had my pattens since ELLEN M CARTHY I live in Bluegate-fields On Sunday morning the 30th of September between two and three o clock I was in Taylor s company after he had quitted Brown he had a pair of pattens in his hand—he was in liquor—I had only had a quartern of gin between four of us and one glass of rum to myself—after having that I and Taylor went back to Bluegate-fields—we came by Collins s door and she spoke first to Taylor—she appeared to be very much in liquor—she said she was glad to see him along with me and not with the witness Brown—I told her to mind her own business and not trouble herself with us and Taylor called her a b——w—the prisoner Robertson was standing at the door with Collins at the time—Collins went in-doors into her own room on the ground-floor and came back again instantly to the door—I left Taylor and went to the door and pushed both the prisoners inside and shut them into Collins s house—the door was opened again directly and both the prisoners came out and Collins said the first b——that touched her her man should knife them—I told her not to be so fast with her knives-Robertson flew from the door and struck Taylor a blow in the mouth with his fist directly—Taylor was about a couple of yards from the door at the time and had the pattens in his hand—he staggered from the effects of the blow-Robertson ran up to him drew a knife from his sleeve and stabbed him in the breast as I held him by the jacket—I did not see Taylor use the pattens at all—he had no time to do so—he had them in his hand-Robertson did not appear very sober—I held Taylor against the wall while he was bleeding and went to fetch a policeman-Robertson made away directly he had stabbed him-Lee the policeman came and Taylor was taken to Dr Bird and then to the London Hospital—I had been drinking three or four glasses of gin and some beer in the morning before but I went to bed after that—when I am in liquor my memory is bad-three or four glasses of liquor and beer will make me drunk—I cannot say how much beer I had drunk-five or six of us were drinking together—I had enough to send me to bed at three o clock in the afternoon to get sober and I kept in bed till half-past two o clock on Sunday morning and then I met these people—I did not see Collins with any knife—I saw no knife pass from her to Robertson—I cannot state what sort of a knife it was Cross-examined Q How many people were with you when you went by the door and pushed them into the house A Nobody but me and the deceased—I am quite sure there was nobody else about till after it was done—I have no doubt about what I have stated Q I suppose you have never said Robertson was not the man who stabbed A At first there were four of us deceived as to the man Brown Eliza Hill Charles Stiles and myself—I am an unfortunate woman—I came out of gaol at a quarter past nine o clock the morning before this happened and I was taken to the police-office on Sunday morning after the deceased went to the hospital for being disorderly—I cannot say how long ft was after this occurred—I drank after this—I have been in gaol once or twice before Q Is it your practice when you come out of gaol to take a round among your friends and take a little liquor with them A Yes—I had done so on the Saturday morning in question—I drank with three or four that morning CHARLES STILES I am a seaman and live in Marmaduke-place St George s-in-the—East On Sunday the 30th of September I was in Bluegate-fields at Ellen Collins s house about half past one o clock in the morning—I fetched half a pint of gin for the prisoner Robertson from a public-house in Ratcliff-highway—I had seen Mary Brown near Collin s house along with Edmund Taylor about ten minutes before that and Brown spoke to me before I went into Collins s house—when I went in Collins gave me a glass of gin and told me to go along with my w-s-a man named Ingram was in the room where Collins was and Robertson was at the door—he went into the room when I did—I came away when Collins told me and saw nothing of the disturbance ELIZA HILL I live in the neighbourhood of Bluegate-fields Between three and four o clock on Sunday morning the 30th of September I was going home and at the corner of Bluegate-fields I saw Brown who I only knew by sight talking to a sailor—I afterwards saw her return by herself in the direction of Collins s house-just at that time I met a man coming as from Collins s house—he had no shoes on—he had a bundle in his right hand and was walking very fast—I went on towards Collins s house and saw the deceased opposite Collins s door leaning against the shop-shutters vomiting and complaining—I went over to him—I had been in company with him before and knew his name—it was Edmund Taylor—I saw Collins at her door alone—she called him a b—— and said You know I did not do it —I did not hear any body say she had done it—Ellen M Cartby came up first and then Brown—Collins had a lighted candle in her hand and was standing on the threshold of the door—I asked her for the candle and she said she would not give it—and as Brown was passing to go to her own door she called her a b——h said she would knife her and shut the door—Taylor had some pattens in his left hand—Ellen M Carthy took them out of his hand and threw them down—I took off my apron and applied it to the wound and remained with him till he was taken to the surgeon s and then to the hospital WILLIAM LEE police-constable K 268 On the morning of the 30th of September I was on duty in Bluegate-fields and heard a call of Police —I saw Edmund Taylor leaning against a shop with his arm against the wall and his head on his arm he was bleeding very much at the breast—he said he had been stabbed by a roan who had just run into Collins s house which he pointed out—the door of the house was open—I went in and saw Collins standing at the door with a lighted candle in her band—my brother officer took the candle—I found Ingram undressed and lying in Collins s bed very much in liquor he seemed not aware of any thing that had passed—I then went and led the deceased to Mr Bird s in the Highway but he was not at home and I took him to the London-hospital and gave him to Mr Andrews—I went to Collins s house again in the evening and found this clasp-knife on the table—Collins was present and Ingram said in her presence That is my knife —there appears to be a stain in the bone of the handle—I said to her I think you know all about who stabbed the man Taylor —I did not make any threat or promise to her—she said No I know nothing about it —I said I believe you do —she said I know nothing about it for I have been in bed all the night with Ingram —I took her into custody Cross-examined Q I suppose you knew her before A Yes—I know nothing of Robertson—I never saw him MR CLARKSON Q Do you know the house in which Collins lived A Yes three or four women of the same description live in the house but not in the same room as her—she lives in the parlour alone—the bed was in the parlour JAMES FOGG I am one of the Thames Police Surveyors I took Robertson into custody on Tuesday the 2nd of October between three and four o clock in the afternoon at the Sailors Home in Wells-street—he had a hat on his head—I took it off and asked how he got a cut which be had just across the top of his head and which appeared fresh—he said he had fallen down and cut it—it was such a cut as might be inflicted with a patten—it was a small cut not exactly straight—I asked him where he slept on Saturday night—he said he slept there meaning the Sailors Home—I said You did not sleep here and a person belonging to the place standing there said No you did not sleep here on Saturday night —I then said Why you stabbed a man in Bluegate-fields on Saturday night or Sunday morning and here is one of your shipmates who you told so —Maull was standing by him—the prisoner said No I did not tell any body any thing of the sort —Maull said Yes you did you told me so —I told him he must go with me—he then said he had been to the King William and got drunk he left there and came up some turnings in Ratcliff Highway which he did not know the name of but he described it and it was by Bluegate-fields—he said as he went up there was noise and somebody struck him with a patten— he called it a batten—he is a Dutchman —that he was sitting in a chair with his shoes off along with a girl but he did not know the girl and some one struck him with a batten and he then picked something off the floor and struck the man with it—I asked him if it was a knife—he said he did not know he was very drank—I told him he must know whether it was a knife or not—he said he did not know—I told him there had been a knife found—he said Oh if that is my knife then I may as well tell all about it —I had not got the knife with me—he said he hoped the man would not die if he did he supposed he should be hanged-another man named Horrabo bad been apprehended on the charge who bore a very great resemblance to the prisoner which was remarked by the Magistrate when this prisoner was taken the prisoner said there was another man in custody for it and an innocent man should not suffer for him he would rather give himself up—I was at the London Hospital when the examination of the deceased was taken—he said some-thing about the prisoners and Collins said she was not outside the house at all that she had been sleeping all night with Ingram and she knew nothing about it JOHN MAULL On Sunday morning about seven o clock while Robertson was in custody I saw the wound on his head—I asked him how he got his head cut—he said he got it struck by a man with a pair of battens—I understood him to mean pattens—I asked him if he had done any thing to the man who struck him with the pattens afterwards—he said he took his knife and stabbed him in the shoulder and he put his hand to my shoulder—I told him he had better get up and have his head shaved and washed—he was lying in bed and the blood came freely from his head—I said May be you have killed the man —he said No I hope not but the blood flowed very freely from him —he then got up and had his head washed—I asked him what he had done with the knife—he said he had lost it—I know his knife—he had been a shipmate of mine— looking at one —this is not his knife—the room we were in was rather dark—he caught hold of my hand and put it on the wound—I felt it and it was about an inch or an inch and a half—it appeared a straight wound Cross-examined Q How long had he been on shore A He came ashore the Monday before—he is a Dutchman—I believe he had come from a foreign voyage HENRY BLAZER I am the agent for the Sailors Home which is a refuge for sailors who come from sea On the 1st of October I went on board the Golconda vessel with the male prisoner—it is the ship he came home in—I afterwards went with him to King William-street to get his wages paid—I left him a little while while I went into a public-house to see for the rest of the men and when I came back I asked him if he had been paid—he said No I must make haste and get out of this for they will be after me —I was not aware of any thing having happened and asked what he meant by that—he said he had got into a row at the King William last night and said The man struck me with a batten on my head—I did not know what I was about—I took out my knife and stabbed him making a motion towards his right breast EDWARD ANDREWS I am house-pupil at the London Hospital On Sunday morning the 30th of September about five o clock Taylor was brought in—he had a wound in the upper part of the right side of his chest—the orifice was about an inch long-such a knife as this might do it—it was a punctured wound full three inches deep but I did not ascertain that at that time—he lived till the 29th of October just a month—there was a post-mortem examination—I have no doubt the wound was the cause of death-an artery of the lungs was cut into—atthe time his examination was taken I hardly think he knew he was dying—he knew it was unlikely he should recover JOHN BESWICKE GREENWOOD Esq I am a Magistrate of the Thames Police I attended at the London Hospital to take the examination of the deceased on the 5th of October—I did not ask him his impression as to his recovery—I thought he might recover and I think he thought so too—the prisoners were present at the examination—it was taken on oath —I should state that both prisoners were not present at first bat the man was and in consequence of something he stated I adjourned the examination for an hour till Collins was apprehended—the examination was then recommenced from the beginning—I took it all afresh-what had passed was read over to her—I took the examination with my own hand—she made some remark in the course of the deceased s statement but I forget what it was—this is the signature of the deceased taken in my presence and countersigned by myself—the prisoners had an opportunity of putting any questions—they had a solicitor present—I should state when Robertson was first brought before me besides the wound on his forehead he appeared to me to have a mark of a circular reddish rim on his forehead—it was not a precise wound—I thought it to be such an impression as might be produced by the rim of a patten— the examination was here read as follows EDMUND TAYLOR sworn saith —I saw the prisoner Robertson once before now—it was on the morning of the day on which he struck me—I never saw him before then nor did I know him—on Sunday morning last about four o clock I think it was I was in Bluegate-fields—I passed near a b——y-house there with a girl named M Carthy—I do not remember that I was carrying pattens—I do not think the girl had any pattens with her—the prisoner Robertson was just in the b——y-house passage—when I was going by I heard the prisoner Collins who was standing at the b——y-house door say Stick him with a knife —I saw a knife pass between the two prisoners—it was a sailor s clasp d knife with a sharp point—the prisoner Robertson ran out of the door and stabbed me and the blood gushed out-if I struck him with a patten I must have picked one up but I do not recollect doing so—I had not one with me—I staggered back against a gateway and two policemen came to me soon after and took me away to this hospital where I have been ever since—I do not remember that I said any thing to the prisoner Robertson nor he to me before he stabbed me—I had not been at the King William that night but I was not sober but I know this is the man by his hair and his countenance—I did not go into the b——y-house in Bluegate-fields—I was going home to No 23 New-street—I am not a sailor but I hare been to sea—I am a cooper by trade—I had known the prisoner Collins before—I had no particular acquaintance with her—this is the girl Collins EDMUND—TAYLOR JOHN BESWICKE GREENWOOD Esq re-examined When Horrabo was brought before me M Carthy said he was the man and when the prisoner was produced she persisted that Horrabo was the man—there was a great similarity between the two—I was not at all surprised at the party being mistaken—there was a great similarity ROBERTSON— GUILTY Confined

t18390812-2237  2237 GEORGE COKER was indicted for the wilful murder of Moses Gates he was also charged on the Coroner s Inquest with the same murder MR PHILLIPS conducted the Prosecution BENJAMIN SOMERVILLE I am a baker and live at Harefield On the 3rd of August I saw the deceased Moses gates at his stall about a quarter or half-past nine o clock in the evening—I was between five and six yards from his stall as near as I can guess—I heard tome noise at the stall and on looking towards it I saw Gates strike the prisoner twice on the side of the head—I am quite sure I saw two blows—he said he would not cut and maul his salmon about for him—the prisoner then went away a little distance and returned in half-a-minute—he was saucy to Gates but I did not hear the words distinctly—Gates ran after him two or three yards—he then came back and Coker followed him and said if he bit him again he would not run away he would give him something for himself—Gates again ran after him and just struck him with his finger on the head as his hand could just reach him—it was his open hand—Gates immediately after came back and said he had stabbed him—there was a candle in a lantern there and I observed a cut in Gates s trowsers just about the stomach when he made the exclamation and the blood was running—the light was taken out of the lantern and one button of his trowsers was undone—he afterwards went to the doctor s Cross-examined by MR JONES Q You were five or six yards from Gates s stall when you first observed them A Yes—I did not observe whether he was bargaining for salmon—I heard him say ho would not cut and maul his salmon for him—I did not hear the prisoner say it was more salmon than he wanted and he would not take it—I did not hear any thing about it—I believe the prisoner is between 14 and 15 years of age—I should say Gates was 21 or 22 years of age—he was rather tall but not very stout—it was not a very heavy blow blow that Gates struck the prisoner in the first instance—I could not see whether it was with his open hand—Gates struck him three times altogether—I only saw three blows—I did not hear the prisoner tell him he would not be knocked about by him—he might have said so without my hearing it—he did not complain of Gates striking him—he did not say a word about it—I do not remember seeing a man named Hanstead then—I did not see the prisoner run behind a man for protection—I lost sight of him for a moment—there were many persons about—I did not see Gates kick at the prisoner under the stall—he might have done it without my seeing it—I did not hear him tell him to go to hell—he might have done so without my hearing it—I have known the prisoner several years—I never knew any thing wrong of him—I have lived in the same village with him nearly all his life but I have been out of Harefield four or five years—I do not know whether he and Gates were acquainted—I never saw them together before COURT Q How long do you think it might be from the first blow that you saw given till the deceased cried out that he was stabbed A Between three and four minutes EDWIN CLIFT I am a stone-mason and live at Harefield On the night in question I saw Gates at his fish-stall—I was about four or five feet from it—I saw Coker there—Gates was weighing some pickled salmon—he told Coker it weighed seven ounces and asked 7d for it—the answer Coker made was Go to hell who do you think is going to give 1d an ounce for your salmon —Gates made no answer just for the moment but Coker kept grumbling about the price and with that Oates gave him one rap on the head—he said Be off about your business who do you think is going to weigh salmon for you —or Why do you come here to order salmon and not take it when it is weighed and gave him a rap on the head—it was with his open hand—it was a smartish rap on the cheek—it was not sufficient to knock him down—it was a kind of blow which a man who was angry at the salmon not being bought would give—after this rap was given the prisoner then said You b—if you hit me again you shall have something for it —this passed in front of the stall—the prisoner then left the front of the stall and went to the back of the stall in the horse road—he came back again in a short time after—it might be a minute and a half—I should not suppose it was above a couple of minutes at most and the first word I heard the prisoner say was Now come and hit me you shall have something for it —he said I sha nt run —these words were repeated by the prisoner move than once or twice—after he had dared the deceased in that way the deceased went towards him—he was then standing with his back a little way towards the road—the prisoner then ran backwards and the deceased followed him to nearly the middle of the road—when the prisoner was running backwards followed by the deceased—he was waving his arms about but whether it was for self-defence I cannot say—I saw no blows pass and Just as they got to near the middle of the road I saw the prisoner make a stand and a sort of rush towards the deceased—they were not a yard apart—the next thing I heard was Coker said You have got it —the deceased put his hand to his belly and came back to his stall and said He has stabbed me—he has run a dagger into me —that was not more than half-a-minute after the prisoner said You have got it —he had not three yards to walk—I taw some blood on his trowsers—I did not see the deceased again till Monday evening—he was dead then—this happened on Saturday evenings Cross-examined Q How many times altogether did Gates strike the prisoner A Only once that I saw—there were a great many more persons round—I did not hear Grates say any thing to Coker when he was running after him the last time—I was ten yards from the middle of the road where they were—I could not tell whether Gates was running after Coker to hit him or to send him away—he did not go very fast—I cannot say what he was going to do—perhaps he might be going to hit him again—I did not see what his meaning was—I did not hear him say if he caught him he would break his back—I think if he had said so I was near enough to have heard it—he did not say any thing before he left the stall—he left the stall when the prisoner was daring him in his business—I did not see him attempt to kick the prisoner—it was just getting dusk—there was no moon Q If he did not appear going to strike him what did you mean by saying that the boy appeared to be waving his arms in self defence A I said I could not tell whether it was in self defence or whether it was to strike the deceased or not—he was going at a pretty quick kind of running walk—I do not know whether they were acquainted before—I have only lived at Harefield about seven weeks—I do not know whether the prisoner went behind a man when he west to the back of the stall—I dare say he did—he ran into the middle of the road when Gates was following him—he did not go behind any man then—a boy named Parr was examined as a witness before the Coroner—he is here JURY Q Had you seen the prisoner with a knife at all previous to the blow being struck A No—I have never seen the knife to this moment NATHANIEL HANSTEAD I saw the bargaining about the salmon and saw it weighed—the prisoner refused to have it and Gates chucked it into the kit again turned himself round and hit Coker two or three times—Coker came back to me stood beside me and cried and said You b— you serve me so again and I will give you something for yourself —Gates was standing at his stall then and I stood between him and Coker—Gates then came from his stall and ran after Coker—he overtook him about the middle of the road about ten yards from where I stood caught him by the collar and hit him twice or three times again —I saw him get five or six blows altogether—he struck him at two different intervals—after the second striking Gates came back to his stall and said Oh dear me he has run a dagger into me —the affair did not occupy above two or three minutes from first to last—it might be five minutes COURT Q From the first slap given on the face of the prisoner to the last affair in the middle of the road how long might it be A Five minutes—to the best of my knowledge would be the outside MR PHILLIPS Q Might it be three minutes A No—I will say five Cross-examined Q The prisoner did all he could to get out of Gates s way A Yes he ran away from him COURT Q The deceased was a young man A Yes—he was as big as I am or bigger—I did not see any knife or other weapon HENRY BULLOCK I am a surgeon I was called in to attend the deceased—I first saw him at three o clock on Sunday morning—I at once saw he was in a very dangerous condition—I observed a wound in the belly which a knife or sharp instrument might have inflicted—I did the best I could for him—he died in about twenty-six hours after the accident—my opinion is that he died from loss of blood occasioned by the wound JOHN ATKINS I am a constable About half-past ten o clock on Saturday night I went to the house of the prisoner s father—I found the prisoner in bed—I searched his breeches pockets and found a pocket clasp-knife—I examined it and saw marks of blood on it—I had asked him where the knife was—he said it was in his trowsers pocket but it was not bloody but I perceived marks of blood on the end of it—I asked him if he was not sorry for what he had been doing—he said no he was not for Gates hit him first—I asked him whether that was the knife he did it with—he said Yes —I gave the knife to the high-con stable of Uxbridge Cross-examined Q Have you known the prisoner long A Ever since he was quite a child—he is the youngest of seventeen children—I never knew any thing against his character as a humane inoffensive boy CHARLES JAMES MURRAY I am high-constable of Uxbridge Atkins delivered this knife to me—it is a common pocket-knife—almost every boy carries such a knife Cross-examined Q Was the prisoner taken before a Magistrate before the inquest was held A Yes he was placed in my custody with orders to take him before the Coroner and then before the Magistrate as I understood—I did not take him back to be examined by the Magistrate as the Coroner refused to allow him to go back in my custody Q Did he give as a reason that the Magistrates had committed Mr Medhurst for manslaughter and he was determined they should not do so again A He did not say it in those words—he said they had acted very improperly in committing Mr Medhurst and he would not give them the opportunity of doing so with this boy—those were his words—a boy named Parr was before the Coroner—he was called into the room and examined partly—he said he saw the whole transaction—he was not bound over as a witness by the Coroner WILLIAM PARR I live at Harefield I am fifteen years of age—I did not see the whole of this affair—I saw part of it Cross-examined Q Did you hear the prisoner ask Gates any thing about a piece of salmon A He asked him for six penny-worth of salmon—Grates took up the tail-piece which had been cut before—it was just as it laid in the kit—he took it out just as it was and wanted 7d for it—the prisoner said he only wanted sixpenny-worth and he would not buy more—Gates said he should not have it for 6d he would have 7d for it if he sold it—Coker said he would not give him more than 6d —Gates put it into the kit again and turned round and hit Coker a slap in the face immediately—it was a pretty good blow—I did not hear him tell Coker to go to hell—he told him to be off for he should not have it for 6d —I did not see Gates try to kick him—I saw him hit him twice—he ran after him—the prisoner tried to get away from him COURT Q where was Coker when you saw him hit twice A stood close to the stall—he ran away and Gates after him MR JONES Q He ran away a good way from the stall at one time did not be A Yes—I do not think It was so far as twenty yards—he did all he could to get away from Gates—I was sworn before the Coroner and examined as a witness COURT Q Do you mean that you took an oath A Yes I had a book given to me in the same way as I have had to-day COURT to JOHN ATKINS Q Do you know whether this boy was sworn A Yes as a witness GUILTY of Manslaughter only Aged 15 — Transported for Life 
t18391021-2937  2937 WILLIAM CALVERT WILLIAM PINE JOHN PINE and JOHN BURKE were indicted for the wilful murder of William Aldridge MR CHAMBERS conducted the Prosecution MARIA HUBBLE I keep the Navy Arms at Deptford On Sunday evening the 29th of September near six o clock the prisoner John Pine and two other men were in my tap-room—they came in from five to six o clock and called for a pot of ale—their conduct was very disorderly—they all came in together—they had one pot of ale—two out of the three were very disorderly and Pine was one of them in consequence of which I spoke to Stevens the policeman—after speaking to Stevens one of the men walked out very quietly—I requested them to go out and so did my husband—the other two stopped ten minutes in the house and behaved very disorderly—Pine was one of those—they then walked out and what happened afterwards I do not know Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did Stevens refuse to come in when you applied to him A He did—there was no crowd or mob except the persons in our house—they were using bad language—the policeman might have got them out without further disturbance—they staid perhaps half-an-hour altogether—the police never come into our house—they tell me they are not allowed to do so—a great many of the penny-bundle people live about us GEORGE STEVENS police-constable R 106 On Sunday evening the 29th of September I was on duty in New King-street Deptford—shortly before six o clock Mrs Hubble spoke to me—I refused to go into the house and went up the street—when I was some distance from her house I heard a shouting noise—it sounded behind me towards the Dock-yard gates—I went towards the place and saw the prisoner John Pine wrestling with a man named Carey opposite the Dock-yard gate near the Navy Arms—there were several other persons there but none connected with the disturbance—I went and asked them to go home—I addressed both of them—John Pine said he would see me d - - first—I said if they did not go home I should be under the necessity of taking them to the station-house—they then commenced wrestling again and shouting and creating a great disturbance—Carey and Pine shouted—I did not hear any body else—they went on wrestling along the New-row—as they went along the number of people increased very much—when they got to Mr Ody s railing there were about a hundred persons present—I went and asked them to go away quietly if they would not I must take them to the station-house but if they would I would not interfere with them—John Pine immediately struck me on the eye and knocked off my hat—I immediately collared him—I said nothing to him when I did so—I had collared him about five minutes when the deceased William Aldridge came to my assistance—during that five minutes I was attempting to get John Pine towards the station-house—I did not draw my staff at that time—Aldridge and myself both drew our staves together when he came to my assistance—John Pine was very violent and trying to getaway from us—the persons round were very violent against me trying to rescue the prisoner from roe and struck John Pine twice on the arm with my staff—I did it in my own protection in consequence of his violence towards me—he was striking and kicking me—I saw a man named Carey pull a rail off Mr Ody s fence—Aldridge and I still continued to endeavour to get Pine towards the station-house—we got him as far as the toll-gate—the mob was increasing very rapid and when we got to the toll-gate they were very violent indeed throwing stones and striking both me and Aldridge—at that time Buckmaster another constable came up and we all three endeavoured to get Pine towards the station-house—we could not succeed on account of the violence of the mob and also of Pine whom we had in custody—Baker another policeman then came up—in consequence of what the mob were doing we endeavoured to get Pine into the toll-house but the mob placed their backs against the door of the toll-house and swore if we put him in they would break the windows and we were obliged to desist from the attempt—I did not hear Pine say any thing during this time—Aldridge and I lost our hats before we got to the toll-house—when we got to the toll-house I heard Aldridge complain of his back in consequence of a stone striking him on his back—the stones were still being thrown while we were there—after some time we succeeded in getting Pine as far as the Telegraph public-house—the mob were throwing stones and shouting all the way—opposite the Telegraph I heard a stone strike Aldridge—I did not see it strike him—it appeared to strike him on the back of the head—he immediately loosened his prisoner put his hand to his head and exclaimed Oh my poor head staggered a few yards and fell—I still kept hold of John Pine—I did not observe him say any thing—I observed persons in the mob and should know them again—I saw William Pine there—he was dose to the deceased when he fell—he was very active in the mob down to the toll-house shouting and exciting the mob—I did not see him do any thing—I saw John Calvert there—I saw him about five minutes not longer—that was just before we got to the toll-house—I saw the prisoner William Calvert at the toll-house—I did not see him afterwards—be was very active at the toll-house exciting the mob and shouting—I did not see him assault either of us COURT Q What distance was it from where you first took hold of John Pine up to the Telegraph public-house A About four hundred yards as near as I can guess MR CHAMBERS Q You had John Pine in custody all this time up to the Telegraph public-house A Yes—none of us used more violence to him than was necessary to get him along Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Are you ordered not to go into houses where disturbances are complained of A Yes unless any thing serious occurs in the house—we can tell whether that is the case or not from to person who comes out for assistance—our orders are not to go into public-houses where there is a complaint of disturbance to see what it is—I did not bear any disturbance when I was first asked to go to Mrs Hubble s—the shouting and noise behind me was of the two men wrestling—I knew John Pine before and knew where he lived—I do not know his occupation—a great many people about there get their living by selling and chopping wood—it is a very thickly populated place Q Will you swear that the mob ever interfered at all either with you or any one of the police till after you struck Pine A No I cannot swear that—I cannot swear that they did not nor that they did—I did not hit him very hard—I did not hit him as hard as I could—I did not I look at his arm after I struck him—the mob did not cry out shame when I struck him—they rushed in and tried to rescue him—at the time I struck him I was on one side of him and Aldridge on the other—he struck me before I struck him—before I collared him he struck me and he struck me after he was in the hands of Aldridge and myself—I cannot swear that he did so before I struck him with the staff—I cannot swear whether the mob interfered before I struck him on the arm—I believe John and William Pine are brothers—the prisoners had been drinking but were not drunk—I did not tell Mrs Hubble if she turned them out I would soon be after them—I told her if they came out and made a disturbance it was my duty to interfere—I cannot swear to the exact words—I did not say I would be after them—it was not long after I struck Pine that Carey pulled down the rail—I did not see him use it—William Pine was about two yards from the deceased when he fell—I was close to him—he was not within a foot of him when I saw him MR CHAMBERS Q What did Mrs Hubble tell you A She said there were a number of men in her house using very abusive and obscene language towards her and I believe her husband and asked me to go in and turn them out as they were very quarrelsome—I told her I was not authorised to go into the house to turn them out unless any thing serious happened but if she turned them out and they made a disturbance out side it was my duty to interfere—I put my staff into my pocket after I struck Pine—I saw the deceased draw his staff but did not see him use it nor did I see the other two constables use theirs MR CLARKSON Q Did Mrs Hubble complain that the men were riotous A No JOSEPH BUCKMASTER I am a policeman I was on duty on the evening of the 29th of September—I went down to the toll-gate and found Aldridge and Stevens there with John Pine in custody—I should think there were about four or five hundred persons there—they were very violent some were throwing stones at the police—I passed through the crowd and got to the policemen and took Pine by the collar—he was very violent—when I collared him he struck me with his fist—I secured his arm and assisted Aldridge and Stevens in endeavouring to get him to the station-house through the crowd—at that time Aldridge was bleeding from the nose or mouth—we did not succeed in getting Pine through the crowd—we endeavoured to get him into the toll-house before that but could not succeed and then Baker came up—we then made another attempt to get Pine towards the station-house and with difficulty we got him through the crowd—on our way towards the Telegraph public-house the mob were stoning us throwing a flinty sort of stone—some gas-pipes had been taken up and there were flints lying on the road—before we got to the Telegraph public-house I heard John Pine say Give me a knife get your knives out you b—s —that was before Baker came to our assistance when I took him by the arm—I believe that was addressed to the mob—it was spoken loud enough to be heard by them—opposite the Telegraph I heard something strike Aldridge on the head—I did not hear Pine say any thing before Aldridge was struck—he used a great deal of obscene language going along the road calling us b—S and bad names—he did so continually going along—it was in a loud voice—he resisted very much—when Aldridge was struck he said something put his hand to his head sidled a few steps and fell—we went on to the station-house with our prisoner—I saw William Pine when we were a the toll-gate—he was in the mob violently obstructing us—he placed himself in a way that we should not pass along the road—some of mob locked their arms together at the toll-gate—I did not see any staff taken out or used by any of the policemen not till we got into Highstreet which is a long way beyond the Telegraph public-house—it was when we procured more assistance and they drew their staves to keep them off from us—I did not use my staff at all-some of the stones struck me Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You were in High-street Deptford when the information was given A Yes about a quarter of a mile from where I came up with Pine and Aldridge—there war a great crowd collected—I found that before I got up to Pine—It took me six or seven minutes to get to where Pine was-Aldridge was on one side of him and Stevens on the other-they both had hold of him—he struck me after I took him by the collar-Steven had hold of him by the collar—he was struggling violently with him-Aldridge had hold of him by the left arm—Stevens hid not hold of him at the time he struck me—I collared him on the same side that Stevens was—I was struck in the breast—it was while Stevens had hold of him that he said Give me a knife take your knives out to the b - - s —those who were standing near I should think must have heard it—I did not see any knife taken out MR CHAMBERS Q At the time this exclamation was used was there a noise A Yes a great noise and the stones were flying about—I took hold of Pine s collar as it was the first place I could get at I did so because he was violently resisting my brother constables—I caught hold of the collar of his jacket—he had no neckcloth and he likewise excited the mob to stone us COURT Q What did he say A He said Now pelt them —that was after Baker came MR BALLANTINE Q Was that said quite loud A Yes those who were near might have heard it—I was in my uniform and so were all the other officers GEORGE BAKER I am a policeman On the evening of the 29th of September I went toward the toll-house at Deptford—I found John Pine in custody of three officer —a great number of persons were assem-bled-they were making a great disturbance and calling out Go it—they were grounding the prisoner and attempting to rescue him—I went toward John Pine and heard him say There is another to b—coming if I had my knife I would stick him —the mob were throwing stone at the time at Aldridge and the other Policemen—I got several blows from stones one on the back of my head and several besides—as we were going toward the Telegraph public-house John Pine struck Aldridge on the back part of the head with his fist—he was very obstinate and resolute wanting to get away from us—opposite the Telegraph public-house I saw Burke throw a stone which truck Aldridge on the back of the head—he threw it at him and said There you b - - how do you like that —I should say he was not more than a yard and a half from him at the time—Aldridge went on a short distance after that—after Burke struck him I heard another stone strike him on the head and he said Oh my poor heard—he went on the left-hand aide of the road and I saw no more of him—I had seen Burke kick Aldridge three or four tune on the back at the toll house and I saw William Pine strike him on the back of the head with his fist at the Telegraph public-house before I heard the blow-Aldridge had no hat on when the stone struck him Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Where did you come from A From High-street-it would not take me more than ten minutes to get up to the spot—I received a wound on the back part of my head and a kick inside the thigh—I seemed after I got the blow on the head from the stone as if I had been coming from the top of the houses—there was no blood—I should say it was about a quarter after seven o clock when we got Pine to the station-house—there were three or four hundred people and four policemen—Stevens Buckmaster and Aldridge had hold of Pine when I came up and I took hold of him when I got up to him—I got through the mob—I was a long time before 1 could get to him—he called to the mob to throw stones and he sometimes told them to be gentle because the stones sometimes struck him as well as us—he told them not to hit him with the stones STEPHEN BROOKMAN I am a messenger in the Victualling-yard Deptford and live near the toll-gate I went out of my house on the Sunday evening when the mob was collected at the toll-gate—two policemen had John Pine in charge—the mob were pushing and calling the police a great many bad names—Pine called them B - - b - - several of the mob called them the same and some of them said Give it to the b - - —they did not do any thing—at that time there were only two policemen there—two others came to their assistance afterwards and they went to take him towards the toll-house to try to get him in—somebody in the toll-house shut the door and somebody behind the toll-house put the shutters up to prevent the windows being broken—when they found they could not get him in they took him towards the station-house up Broom fields—I followed them about two hundred yards and saw a man fling a stone at one of the police—I do not know who that man was—it was before they got to the Telegraph public-house—I left the crowd before they reached the Telegraph public-house—the conduct of the mob was very bad flinging stones at the police and calling them every thing they could lay their tongues to—the police had great difficulty in getting their prisoner forward—he would not go and if it had not been for the mob he would have gone better—I do not know which policeman it was the stone struck—it hit him on the left side of his head—John Pine conducted himself very badly—he would not go along—they told him it would be better for him if he would go quietly—he said he would see them b - - first before he would go—the conduct of the police was very good towards him—I never saw either of them strike him all the time Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q At what part of the affray did you come up A Very near the toll-gate—I live four or five houses from the toll-gate COURT Q You say a stone struck a policeman on the left side of his head had that policeman his hat on or off A Off—the man that flung was about three or four yards from the policemen—there were two policemen without their hats JAMES WOLVERTON I am a timber-dealer and live in Broomfield-place Deptford directly opposite the toll-gate I saw the mob from my window—I did not hear them say or see them do any thing—I saw the policemen with the prisoner in custody and the mob were surrounding the policemen—I merely heard the noise of the mob but I heard no particular words spoken—I consider the policemen behaved with very great forbearance SAMUEL HOLMES I live in Prospect-place Lower-road about fifty yards from the toll-house—I saw the mob in New-row about fifty yards e for e it arrived at the toll-house—when I first saw it there were about twenty or thirty persons and only one policeman—I was attracted by a policeman running from the toll-house down the New-row—the other policeman had got John Pine in custody—he was using violent exertions to disengage himself from the policeman who had hold of his collar—I did not see either of the policemen strike him—after the two policemen had got him the mob increased very materially—when they got to the toll-house they closed in on the policemen who had the man in custody and from their manner I suppose were trying to rescue the prisoner but the number of the mob prevented the people outside seeing what they were doing—there was a great deal of hooting and hissing and shouting from the mob—I saw stones thrown in New-row before they got to the toll-house—they were thrown by the mob surrounding the policemen and evidently at the policemen—I went with the mob from where it first occurred up to the station-house—during that time the policemen conducted themselves with very great forbearance from what I saw Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q If the policemen struck any body you would have seen them A They might have struck while the crowd was round without my seeing—I did not see enough of them to say whether they struck any body—I saw a great deal of them—I had a full view of them at first—I was there five or ten minutes during which time no blows were struck—I was about twenty yards from the policemen on the road looking at them FRANCIS JOHN HALL I live on my property and live in Broom fields between the toll-house and the Telegraph public-house—I am one of the overseers of Deptford—I saw the mob and the policemen go by my house with John Pine in custody—the conduct of the policemen was very forbearing indeed and the mob were very riotous—I saw a policeman with his hat off Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q How far were you when you first saw them from the place where the policemen had hold of Pine A The policemen had hold of Pine in nearly the centre of the road and I was on the path—I should think I saw them for something less than twenty minutes—I did not see the policemen strike Pine—I did not see a staff in their hands nor an attempt to draw one from their pockets—their conduct was very forbearing WILLIAM FRENCH I am the toll-gate keeper I was at the toll-gate when the mob and policemen were there—the policemen conducted themselves very well indeed—I did not see them use any violence at all—the mob conducted themselves very bad indeed—I saw them

times—I saw some marks on his face and his mouth appeared to have a very severe blow—I did not see any blood—my wife was inside the toll-house and in the confusion out of fear she shut it up JAMES RICHARDS I am pot-boy at the Rodney Arms public-house in New King-street Deptford I was on the footpath between the toll-gate and the Telegraph when the mob were there and the police were taking Pine to the station-house—I saw Aldridge the policeman there and Calvert and John Pine who they were taking prisoner—before they got to the Telegraph there were stones flying from all parts like hail-stones at the policemen—I saw Calvert when the mob got near the Telegraph—he was about two or three yards off—I heard him say Go it give it him and several persons behind hallooed out Give it to the b - - without a hat —Woolmer was in company with me close at my right-hand side—Calvert was then about three yards from Aldridge—I knew Calvert before by coming to the Rodney Arms public-house several times EDWARD WOOLMER I work at a wood-yard at Deptford for me Fletcher I was in the road between the toll-gate and the Telegraph and saw the mob there—before they arrived at the Telegraph a great many stones were flying about in all parts and the mob were saying Go it give it to that b - - without a hat —I saw Aldridge without a hat—I saw stones thrown at him near the Telegraph—when I got just by the Telegraph I saw Calvert pick something up off the ground—I suppose it was a stone—I saw him deliver it out of his hand and saw it strike the deceased under the right ear—he was about two yards from him at the time—on the stone striking him I saw Aldridge stagger a few paces out of the road and fall against a person s door—there were steps to the door Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Were you in company with Richards A Yes—I had been there about half an hour—I went from there into New King-street not with the mob—I had been with the mob about half an hour walking along THOMAS KING I am a baker and live at Broom fields Deptford about twenty yards from the toll-gate The toll-gate is rather between my house and the Telegraph—my house is at the corner—I saw John Pine in custody of the police I was at Wolverton s gate between the toll-gate and the Tele-graph—he was conducting himself in a very violent manner and was kicking and fighting at the police—there were a great many persons assembled—I heard a man named Brooks say to Pine Go quietly Johnny and I will bail you out to-morrow —he did not go quietly—I saw the deceased draw his staff but he did not use it on account of the mob threatening him I believe—I heard them threaten him—I went about fifty yards past the Telegraph—the police conducted themselves in the best possible manner—some of the mob were threatening the police and some throwing stones—saw many stones thrown at the police—John Pine resisted very much after he left the toll-gate COURT Q Did you interfere with any of the mob who were

interfering further from what the man said JAMES HAIRSINE I am a policeman of the R division I came up to the assistance of the other policemen near the lower end of High-street—that was after they had passed the Telegraph—I saw the prisoners Burke and William Pine in the crowd shouting hissing and making a noise—saw the Telegraph public-house about ten minutes before the affray began and it was lighted up—there was a very strong light there—I could see any one in the middle of the road very well—it was gas-light CHARLES HAMPTON I am a miller and live at Broom fields Deptford—on the 29th of September on the same side of the way as the Telegraph and within two doors of it I saw the police with somebody in custody as they went towards the Telegraph I heard the mob say Kick him down kick him down —I observed Aldridge without his hat at time—he was leaning on the other policeman s shoulder and just before he got to the Telegraph he left him and came and sat down at the door of my house leaning his head down and said Oh dear my head —I was up stairs—I went down to him and found him sitting on the steps bleeding with his hand on his head—his staff was in his pocket—I took him into my house—Mr Downing the police surgeon was sent for and saw him there—he was afterwards taken away on a stretcher BETSEY WHITE I was in Broomfield-place on this Sunday night—I saw Aldridge leave the mob when near the Telegraph—I did not see what happened to him before that—he reeled to our house and leant on the palings to support himself—he then sat on the steps of my daughter s Mrs Richardson s house where I was at the time—the street-door was open—his head did not knock the steps—he fell on the mat with his hand on his head—his head did not touch the steps—he was removed into the house—he was quite sensible from the time he came in till he went out—Mr Downing visited him HANNAH RICHARDSON I am the daughter of the last witness I saw Aldridge come out of the crowd—he came reeling up to our door and fell with his hand on his head on the mat of our door—his bead did not strike the steps I am sure EDWARD DOWNING I am surgeon to the R division of police I was oiled to see Aldridge at Mrs Richardson s house on the 29th of September between six and seven o clock at night—at that time he was lying on the carpet down stairs—he complained of great pain behind the ear and was bleeding slightly from the wound which was about two inches behind the right ear—I dressed the wound and he became faint—I gave him some brandy and water—I asked him whether he would go to the hospital—he said he would rather go home—he was taken home which was about two miles or two miles and a half on a stretcher—I saw him again at his own house at half-past three o clock in the morning—he was sinking—he died about an hour and a half after I left him—I examined the body after death with two other surgeons and I am of opinion that his death was caused by fracture of the internal plate of the skull—I opened the head—there was about three quarters of a pound of extravasated blood between the skull and the Duran mater-—I attribute his death to external jury from a blow—I think such a blow as would be inflicted by a stone COURT Q Was the skull thick or thin A Remarkably thin—there was a slight abrasion also on the left side of the head and a contusion on the left eye with ecchymosed WILLIAM PHIFPS I am a police-inspector I saw William Aldridge dead—I went to the road between the toll house and Telegraph on the Tuesday morning following and picked up some stones which I have here— producing some —these are the sort of stones which were laying there—the road had been broken up to lay down gas-pipes and there were a quantity of stones—the Telegraph is in the parish of St Paul

t18420228-901  901 JAMES ROBERTS was indicted for the wilful murder of Mary Reed MR ADOLPHUS conducted the Prosecution GEORGE FRANCIS CROW I am a butcher and live at No 54 York-street Westminster I had known the deceased nine years—her name was Mary Reed—on Monday the 14th of February about ten minutes before seven o clock in the evening she called on me and asked whether my child was out—I saw the prisoner after that—he is a knife-grinder I believe—when I first saw him he had a grindstone in his right hand and two kettles in the left—he was then at the further end of the Crown public-house in York-street on the pavement—he was standing quarrelling with two women using very bad language making threats and shoring them off the pavement—one of the women complained to me of his behaviour—Mary Reed came by just afterwards and the prisoner said Here is another b—old gin-drinker —she had said nothing to him—she had no appearance of being in liquor—he then shoved her several times and as she went by my shop I said to him Don t use the poor old woman like that —he was following her—she had not done any thing to him in the least—she said afterwards You would not serve me so if my husband was here —there is a green-grocer s shop beyond mine in the way she was going to her home and when she got opposite the window of that shop the prisoner shoved her again—she had a pair of shoes in her hand and she put up the shoes in his face—she hoisted them up in her hand in his face—I do not know whether it was to guard off the blow or not—I cannot swear whether they touched his face—he then struck her with the kettle on the hand in which she held the shoes—she directly ran into the Fortune of War beer-shop which is to the left of my place and over which she lodges—it is next door to the green-grocer s—the Crown is next door to me on the right the green-grocer s on the left and the Fortune of War next to that—after she had gone into the beer-shop I said to the prisoner Go on that s a good fellow —he said I will serve you in the same way —he stood at the beer-shop door on the edge of the pavement—a young person then came up with his knife-grinder s barrow I cannot say whether it was his daughter or who it was and he told her to go on with it home—he said he would beat the old b—y b—brains out before he went away—he said that while he was waiting there—the deceased was an elderly woman—I should say she was in the beer-shop more than three minutes—there are two little folding-doors out of the beer-shop and when she came out the prisoner took the grindstone and struck her with it over the left side of her head—he had hold of the buff-end—there is a little wheel at one end the buff as it is called on which they brighten the knife and at the other end is the little stone—this now produced is it—he held it between the two wheels—this buff end is made of wood and lined with leather—he struck her with the stone end on the head and she fell backwards right into the beer-shop—I sent a boy for a policeman—the prisoner was going to walk off but the policeman came running across the road and Mr Reed the deceased s husband came down stairs and he was taken into custody—the prisoner appeared to have been drinking but was not to say drunk—the deceased was perfectly sober—she was fifty-five years of age Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Were you on terms of great intimacy with her A No only so far that she used to be fond of one of my children and used to fetch the child—she was not in my employ—I never visited her or any thing of that sort—her husband is a stone-mason—I did not know the prisoner before—the deceased called on me about ten minutes before seven o clock and it was about ten minutes or a quarter-past seven when she and the prisoner met at the further end of the Crown—she did not come into my house when she called—I was sitting outside my shop-board—I was sitting on my shop-board when I saw them meet and I should say fifteen yards off—I heard him using very vile language—I was near enough to hear what was said by them—I was not able to hear what the deceased said—I can swear she was not using vile language—I cannot say whether she was speaking or not Q Then what did you mean by swearing she never used bad language A Because I never heard a bad word out of her lips—I know she was a religions woman—the prisoner was the worse for liquor—he was not exceedingly drunk—when I first saw him he was quarrelling with two women—I did not see him walking before that—he had some kettles in one hand and the grindstone in the other—he was not calling out Kettles to mend or any thing of that kind—I can swear that Q Was not the first of the affair this that the kettles he held in his left-hand knocked against her in passing A No—I can undertake to swear it was not so for she passed inside close against the wall—she always walked close against the wall—he was outside of the pavement—she was very infirm and she kept close against the wall—I saw her coming along close against the wall—he was standing still then where I first saw him with the two women—she did not turn round and say something to him on his rubbing the kettles against her for that did not happen—I cannot swear whether she hit him with one of the shoes in her hand—she put up her hand I think to guard the blow from the kettle—at that time no blow had been struck only his shoving her—on my oath she did not upon that strike him a violent blow in the face with the shoes—I would not swear they did not touch his face—they were a pair of heavy men s shoes—there is an alley between the green-grocer s and the beer-shop and she used to go that way home—it was her way home—she did not run up the alley after patting the shoes up in his face—she ran into the beer-shop—she did not go up the alley at all at any period—she ran to the beer-shop—she was standing I should say three yards from the beer-shop when she was struck with the saucepan—she did not run up the alley and return with one shoe in each hand strike the prisoner a blow on the breast with either shoe and then run into the Fortune of War—I never saw a blow—I can swear such a thing did not occur that I saw—she was above three minutes in the Fortune of War—I did not take out my watch to look but I am clearly of opinion it was three minutes—while she was in there the prisoner said to me that he would serve me the same—that was all he said to me—he held the grindstone up in his hand waving it about—he did not shake it in my fact and he was doing the same with the saucepans—it was just about that time the deceased came out—I would not say to a minute—she did not come out at the time he was waving the saucepans and things about for I walked back to my shop before she came out of the public-house—I returned again that very moment—he was still waving about the saucepans—I did not go inside my shop—I sat on the outside board—I was not at all out of sight of the man—it was after he had used the expression about beating her brains out that I went and sat at my shop-board ELIZABETH RUTTER I am a widow and live at No 1 York-terrace York-street Westminster I am a lacemaker and keep a stall On the night of the 14th of February I saw the prisoner in York-street—my attention was first drawn to him by his using very improper language to two females who were passing by—after those women had passed by I saw Mrs Reed and he said the same language to Mrs Reed as he had to the others—he called her an old b— and asked if she was going to the gin-shop—she said Go along —she was against a side door of the beer-shop where she goes up stairs—she lives over the beer-shop—the side door is in the main street not in the alley—after using this improper language to her he kept still standing with her—she wanted to try to get away from him—she was going the opposite way from her own home up the street with a pair of shoes in her hand—she was coming out of her home when I saw her first walking towards Mr Crow s and when the prisoner spoke of her in this insulting manner and followed her she turned round to go home again—he turned round to follow her and stood in the doorway of the private door of the beer-shop where she lived so that she could not get in either one way or other—there is a public door to the beer-shop for the people to go in at and a private door for the lodgers—both doors are in the main street—she strove to get past him he would not let her pass and he up with the saucepans which he had in his left hand and struck her a blow on the left hand—Mrs Reed then turned and went into the beer-shop—the prisoner said You need not go in there for protection I will wait for thee till thee comes out be as long as thee like —he said nothing more that I heard—she staid in the beer-shop about three minutes or it might be four—he had this grindstone in one hand and the saucepans in the other—as she came out of the beer-shop door he lifted up his right hand and struck her with the grindstone as she was coming out at the door—she had not said or done any thing to him at that time—it occurred as soon as Mrs Reed appeared—it was the stone part that struck her head—she fell back into the shop—while she was in the beer-shop the prisoner waited outside—he was not grinding or doing any thing but merely waiting at the door and he said he would give her a topper whenever she came out I did not hear him say any thing after—I did not know him before—he was rather in liquor but not to say very much intoxicated—he had been drinking Cross-examined Q Were you a friend of Mrs Reed A No particular friend only by knowing her—I had known her for about fifteen years but was not acquainted with her more than other people—I was examined before the Coroner—what I said was taken down and read over to me—I am sure it was the stone end he struck her with—that I swear—I have no doubt of it—I never doubted which end it was he struck her with—I did not hear Mr Crow s evidence to-day or at the inquest—I have seen him since the occurrence of course—I stand opposite to where he lives—I do not visit him—I have not talked with him about this stone since nor about which end the deceased was struck with—I have not talked with Mr Crow about the matter at all—I have been to his shop to buy a bit of meat but not to talk about this affair nor did I talk about it—I never alluded to it in any way—he never spoke to me about it nor I to him not any thing concerning the stone nor yet what had happened—I have certainly mentioned Mrs Reed s name and said I knew her for fifteen years—I made a mark to my deposition after it was read over to me before the Coroner Q Is this true then— reads — He instantly struck her on the head I don t know whether it was with the grindstone or the buff A I said the grindstone was at one end and the buff at the other—I said he had the spindle in his hand and struck her with the grindstone—I put my mark to what was read over to me by which I meant that it was true—she came out of the public door of the beer-shop when the blow was struck and the prisoner was close to the doorway when she came out—I saw Mr Crow there he was nearer to the prisoner than he was to me—he very likely might have heard what the prisoner said—I did not see Mrs Reed put a pair of shoes into the prisoner s face—I saw her lift up her hands to defend herself but not to strike him—I could not say whether the shoes were in her right or left hand but I saw the shoes in her hand—I cannot say whether they were in the hand which she lifted up to defend herself—the lifted up both hands together—I did not see her strike him with the shoes—I did not see her run up the alley—she was against the alley when I saw him strike her against the private door—she was not in the alley but standing against the side door—there is a passage close by the side door—she did not go up the passage after he struck her or before—she went into the beer-shop after he struck her—she had come out of the alley with the shoes—I had seen her several times that evening—I saw the prisoner insult her and ask her if she was going to the gin-shop—she did not go up the passage after that only against the doorway—I did not see her strike him on the breast with the shoes WILUAM ALFRED KEAN I live at No 84 Castle-lane York-street and am agent to my father who is a bacon-factor in a small way and is not able to attend to business himself On the evening of the 14th of February I was in the Fortune-of-War beer-shop about seven o clock when the deceased came in—she went into the tap-room door and called some men out to drive a man away who she was afraid was going to strike her—nobody went on her call—they did not take any notice—she spoke to a young man who was asleep and he took no notice—she then went to the door again and took one door in each hand—they are double doors—she had been in the beer-shop from three to five minutes—she did not get quite outside the door before I heard a blow and saw her stagger back on to a settle—she said the roan had knocked her down with a grindstone—seeing the woman bleed I went to the door with her and the prisoner said it served her right he would do it again and if she was drunk he was not—I had not spoken to him—he could see her when she and I came to the door together—the deceased was not drunk or at all in liquor—the prisoner was a little the worse for liquor but not so bad as not to know what he was about Cross-examined Q Had you known the woman before A I had about two years—I have not heard the other witnesses examined here or at the inquest—I believe they stated that the deceased was about three or five minutes in the beer-shop—I have no doubt that was their evidence—I did not take out my watch to see how long she remained in—I suppose it was that time—when nobody would assist her she went out immediately—she was quite sober—I have been outside the Court and hare not heard the other witnesses examined WILLIAM HENRY POST police-constable B 58 The prisoner was given into my custody—the first thing next morning he asked me where the woman was—I told him she was not able to attend to give her eviddence—he made answer directly G—d b—r her eyes I wish I had killed her quite if I had known she was going to give me such a could berth as she did I would have knocked her down and jumped on her and killed her quite —he said that entirely of his own accord—I new put a question to him REGINALD JAMES I am a house-surgeon at Westminster-hospital The deceased was admitted into the hospital on the 14th of February—she had a starred wound on the upper part of the head a little on the left side—it was cut in two or three directions—it did not appear to bare been done by a sharp instrument—she lived two days—she was not insensible but in a very stupid state—she was not sensible except when roused—she had lost a good deal of blood at the time of the accident I think been fore she was brought—she died from concussion of the brain which the wound would occasion—I attended the inquiry before the Coroner and there was a view of the body—I did not see the Jury view it but the body was there—it was the body of the same person that was brought to the hospital Cross-examined Q What time did you first see her A I think about half-past seven o clock—at that time she had the appearance of haveing lost a great deal of blood and the wound was then bleeding-no proper steps had been taken to stop the blood—that would occasion great weakness and I should say would render recovery less probable Witnesses for the Defence THOMAS CHANDLER I am a smith and live at No 6 Union-place Castle-lane near York-street I never saw the prisoner or deceased before this occurrence to my knowledge—I was crossing from Castle-lane into York-street opposite the Fortune-of-War beer-shop and saw the prisoner walking in the same direction I was towards the Fortune-of-War—he had two kettles in his left hand and a grindstone in his right—he was calling Pots and kettles to mend —he appeared to be drunk—I saw Mrs Reed close behind him going in the same direction as he was and she passed him just before she got to the green-grocer s shop—I was then about eight or nine yards from them—she passed him on the side where the kettles were between him and the wall and I saw the kettles go against her gown—the kettles might have struck her as she passed—he was hallooing out Kettles to mend in a careless manner—as she passed him she said something to him—I did not hear what—I was not close enough to hear and then she struck him on the left-hand with two shoes which she had in her right hand—he did not do any thing to her after that—she hastened towards the alley and went up the alley—she remained up the alley about a minute—she then came down again with one shoe in each band said something to him again and hit him on the breast or upper part of the body with one shoe after the other—up to that time the prisoner had not struck her any blow at all—after she had struck him on the breast with the shoes she ran into the Fortune-of-War—he said something to her I cannot say the words and followed her to the door—she remained in the beer-shop about a minute or it might be a little longer but I think it was about a minute—I saw the blow struck—the prisoner appeared very much excited after he had been struck MR ADOLPHUS Q Where were you going to at the time A To take a walk down Westminster merely for recreation—my hours of business were over—the whole of this only took about five or six minutes—I cannot say exactly to a minute—when there is a case of this kind going on it is not likely I should pass on and take no notice—the woman was in a great passion—she used words but I cannot say what they were and the prisoner also—I saw them wrangling with each other—I was not waiting there I was advancing towards them—I did not stand in the middle of the road all the time—I did not walk very quickly—William Duggan was waiting for my coming up—he had come from the same place with me—I had occasion to stop in Castle-lane and he waited while I came up—it was five or six minutes before the policeman came up—I waited till the policeman came up and the prisoner was given into custody—I did not speak to the policeman—I went to the station but they would not let us in—I went to the door and Duggan and another man who I do not know went in but were turned out—the blood ran down from the woman s head pretty fast—I did not say anything to the prisoner when he struck her—there were so many people round I could not get near—I did not hear of the Coroner s inquest until after it was over—I was at work at the time—I work for Mr Thompson MR BALLANTINE Q You went to the station at the very time A Yes with Duggan—I have left my work now to come here and give evidence—I know nothing of the prisoner WILLIAM DUGGAN I am a stonemason and work for Mr Eyres Chandler lodges with my mother—I came with him on the evening in question down Castle-lane into York-street—he left me at the Stag public-house Castle-lane to go to a place of convenience and he crossed the road to me afterwards—I waited for him on the curb on the opposite side of the road—as Chandler was crossing the road towards me I turned my head to go where we were going to have a drop of beer together and I saw the deceased and the prisoner in contact together—I had never seen either of them before—he had two large saucepans in hit left hand and a grindstone in his right—by what I could see I think they were both going one way—they were close together with the exception of the saucepans being between them—I did not see any blow struck with the saucepans—he was swinging them about carelessly singing out Old tin kettles to mend in a jovial sort of way—the saucepans rubbed against her as she passed and the went into a little bit of a court between a greengrocer s shop and the beer shop—before that she struck him on the left arm with a pair of shoes which she had in her hand—I cannot say to within two or three inches of where she hit him but it was somewhere about there—they were jawing each other talking very loud—she struck him once before she went into the passage and twice after she came out—she could not have gone far up the passage—there is a bright light at the entrance of the passage—she came down with a shoe in each hand and kept jawing the prisoner—they kept jawing each other all the time—she struck the prisoner with the shoes about the arm or shoulder and once on the breast and they both called each other names—after striking him she ran into the beer-shop—she was not in there above a minute or a little more I cannot exactly judge and when she came out the blow was struck by the prisoner—I should think he was a little fresh—he had had a little but not knowing his ways I could not exactly tell MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you and Chandler come out of your mother s house together A Yes—we were going to have a pint or pot of beer—he was in work and I was out and he of course asked me to hare a drop of beer—that was what we went out for not for a walk—we had to go to the Cock public-house in Tothill-street which is about a quarter of mile from our house—I saw plenty of other women in the street but did not see the prisoner interfere with them—I had my back to them and did not hear any thing particular going on—I did not see him interfere with then—I did not say any thing to him when he and the deceased were jawing each other—I never like to interfere with other people s business in fact I rather supposed they were man and wife—she first struck him with one shoe then went into the alley came out with a shoe in each hand jawed him and struck him again—he stopped at the door and he said if she came out he would give her something for herself for striking him and he staid there till she did come out—I should not think it was above a minute or a little more—I cannot say it was two minutes—it was a very short time—I was waiting there for Chandler to come over to me and of come seeing a row I stopped like anybody else—Chandler had joined me before she came out of the beer-shop—I went to the station—I was let in but was turned out again—they would not allow me to stay—I did not make any statement—I did not go before the Coroner—I was looking for work that day—I was not aware that she was dead or that there was a jury it panelled—I was not aware of her death till after the inquest—I am no acquaintance of the prisoner s—his wife found me out—I went next morning to Queen-square to give evidence for the prisoner to tell the rights of it but there was no examination there MR BALLANTINE Q You say you made no statement at the station did you go there for that purpose A Yes—I would have made the statement I have now if they had given me the opportunity—I went to Queen-square to do so but found there was no examination there—the prisoner appeared very much excited after the blows were struck and in a great deal of passion which did not appear to have subsided before she came out—he seemed to be quite jolly before the quarrel took place—he seemed to be swinging the kettles about quite jolly like JOHN WHITLEY I am a shoemaker and work with my father in palmer s village Westminster—I am not acquainted with Duggan or Chandler or with the prisoner nor did I ever see Mrs Reed before the night in question—I was passing down York-street and saw the prisoner and the deceased against the Crown public-house—they were not very close together then—the prisoner had the grindstone in his right-hand and some kettles in his left and they touched against the deceased s gown against the Crown upon which she hit him on the left hand I believe with the shoes—she then went on and went up the passage next to the green grocer s—she did not remain there above a minute—she then came down again with a shoe in each hand—she called the prisoner an insulting vagabond—I was near enough to hear what she said—he made use of a bad word to her and then she hit him on the arm and on the breast with the shoes she held in each hand—she then went into the Fortune-of-war—he waited outside and said if she was to come out to abuse him again he would bit her with the grindstone—he had it in his right hand at the time—he appeared quite calm when he said that—he was going away just as she came out—I do not think she was a minute in before she came out—when I first saw him he was singing Pots to mend kettles to mend nobody helps poor Jack the tinker —I was standing against the Crown when the deceased struck him the blow on the left hand—he went on singing after that past Mr Crow s—she went up the alley came down again and struck him again with both shoes—I believe she struck him in earnest—the called him an insulting vagabond and he used a coarse expression to her in earnest and on that she struck him again—she struck him with one shoe in two places and she then ran into the beer-shop—they were abusing each other MR ADOLPHUS Q Where were you when you first saw either of these parties A I was going past the Crown public-house and I stopped bearing this singing—I did not see any other women near him—the deceased and he were going the same way—I think he was a little before—she attempted to pass him inside nearest the wall—he did not say anything then—I saw Mr Crow sitting on his board after she had hit the prisoner first—I do not think I heard Mr Crow say anything—I think the deceased remained in the passage about a minute—I do not think she stopped so long as that in the Fortune-of-war—I cannot say how far up the alley she went—I did not go to the alley to see—she came out with a shoe in each hand—she had both in one hand before—she struck him twice with one hand—once on the arm and once on the breast not in the face at all—he used the expression to her and told her to go into the gin-shop it was all she was fit for—she up with the shoe on that and then went into the Fortune-of-war—he said if she came out again he would hit her—he did not say anything about waiting for her—he seemed as if he was going on when she came out and then when she came out he hit her with the grindstone not with the stone part but the other part—I am sure of that—he lifted up his hand and struck down at her—he held it in the middle with the stone part at the back then lifted it up and struck—she made back and I believe she fell down—I cannot say whether she fell down or slipped down—she did not fall with the blow—he hit her at the door she went inside and fell—I did not go in to see what was the matter—I went to the station but they would not let me in—the deceased was bleeding as she went along—I heard of the inquest before it was held but did not appear there Q How came you here to-day A His wife took my name down I think it was a day or two after it was done or when he was committed here to Newgate—another grinder knew a boy who is outside and he told the prisoner s wife where I lived MR BALLANTINE Q The prisoner s wife searched you out and brought you here A Yes—the prisoner had the grindstone in his hand at the time this happened and was swinging it backwards and forwards MICHAEL STEWART I am a labourer and live in King s-head-buildings James-street Westminster which is close to York-street I was passing by York-street and saw the prisoner walking by the Crown public-house—I did not know him or Mrs Reed before—he had the grindstone in one hand and some kettles in the other crying Potsto mend —I then saw Mrs Reed passing him and the kettles touched her upon which she struck him on the hand with a pair of shoes which she had in her hand—she then went up the court and remained there about a minute I should say—she came down again with a shoe in each hand having had both in one hand previously hit him on the breast and on the arm and called him an insulting vagabond—that was close to the Fortune-of-war-after striking him she went into the Fortune-of-war and remained there I think about half-a-minute—I do not think it was more and when she came out he struck her this blow—before she struck him with the shoes he appeared to be in a good humour—he was going along singing Pots to mend kettles to mend nobody will help poor Jack the tinker —he had the kettles by his side—he said one bad word to Mrs Reed that I heard—that was just before she went into the public-house—he did not appear to be very angry at that time—he was standing outside—I do not think be was sober MR ADOLPHUS Q But sober enough to be singing and crying his trade A He was hallooing those words—I first saw him walking by the Crown public-house—I saw no women there—I did not see him speak to any women except the deceased—she walked up the alley—she was coming towards the Fortune-of-war public-house when I first saw her—I staid till the police came and went to the station but was not let in MR BALLANTINE Q Did you come here at the request of the prisoner s wife A Yes GUILTY of Manslaughter Aged 39 — Transported for

t18460223-685  685 JOHN FEACY was indicted for the wilful murder of Thomas Martin he was also charged on Coroner s Inquisition with the like offence MESSRS BODKIN and BRIERLY conducted the Prosecution SUSANNAH EMBERSON I live at No 8 Cradle-court Red Cross-street—I knew the deceased Martin—he was in St Martin s workhouse—that was his last residence before he died—I know the prisoner—he lived in Cradle-court—I lived with him for two years and a half—I had not previously lived with him—I had previously lived with Martin but not for above these three years—I did so for thirteen years and had four children by him—the two last are living—we were compelled to separate through being distressed about three years ago—there was about twelve months interval between my separating from the one and living with the other—I was in the house myself—on Tuesday the 17th of Feb between ten and eleven Martin came to No 8 Cradle-court where I was to remove my things belonging to me—he first came on the Tuesday morning—I had told the prisoner on the Monday morning that I would not live with him any longer—Martin was assisting me in removing the furniture which was left to me by my uncle—Martin came again after that and we went out together—it was about one o clock or I should say between twelve and one when we came back—Martin remained there with Feacy and we all three sat talking together—Feacy made an objection at first in the morning to my removing the things—that was the cause of our going out—in the afternoon I went out between one and two to look for a room to remove my things to and Martin remained there with Feacy and their children—no one else—the elder child is nine years of age and the other seven—I came back about two I should think or between two and three—I cannot say exactly the time—I found them both there—Martin had tied up the bed ready to be removed and took it away to the lodging that I had taken and I remained on the stairs—he came back again and we went into the room and then Martin began to undo the bedstead and while he was doing so I gave him a bed-winch out of the drawer—Martin said that would not undo it and I went to see if I could borrow one and when I came back Martin had undone the bedstead without it and had tied it up partly and while tying it up Feacy asked me about a shirt—it was a shirt belonging to my uncle—I was looking up the dirty things and I picked up the shirt and said to Martin This is one of my uncle s and I said to Martin Never mind that let him have that and I threw it down on the floor—Martin said Oh he shan t have that and with that Feacy laid hold of it and there was a struggle between the two—Martin twisted it out of his hand and threw it on the floor and with that Martin stooped to finish tying up the bedstead and while he was stooping tying up the bedstead Feacy took the knife and run it into his side—the knife laid on the table when he took it a few minutes before I saw it—the table was near to him on the left-hand side of him—they were one on each side the table because there was about a yard between them—the prisoner was close against the place where the knife was—it was a long table-knife and had not been used for some months—it had been in the cupboard and had been lying on the table for some time rusty—it was an old carving-knife—on the wound being inflicted I said Oh and Martin said Oh I am stabbed —I run down stairs instantly to the landlady in the bottom room and said Oh he has stabbed Martin —my eldest son was there and I said Run for the doctor and he run for the doctor Mr Ponder in Redcross-street—when I came back I went up stairs and the police had got the prisoner—the name of the deceased was Thomas Martin—he remained in the room till next day—I have seen him since his death Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q I believe Martin came out of the workhouse that morning A Yes—while we were at the house in the morning about eleven o clock Martin had some beer and Feacy sent my little boy out for some gin—I did not have any gin myself—only Feacy had gin—Martin and I had some beer—I drank some with him—we had a pot of beer between us—after that we had another pot when we were up stairs in the room with Feacy before this happened—I did not have any after that—I am prepared to swear that—the things which were left to me by my uncle I received on last boxing-day and I took them home—the prisoner is a type-founder—the last place he worked at I think was Mr Thorowgood s in Fann-street—he only worked there a short time—the shirt that I have been speaking of the prisoner had been in the habit of wearing—Martin was a bigger man than the prisoner a strong stout man—I have been in the habit of being intoxicated with Feacy latterly since Christmas—I came in afterwards with the surgeon—we came both together I believe—he came with me instantly—about five minutes elapsed between my going out and coming back—Martin was tying up this bedstead with the cord belonging to it—I have mentioned before that he called out Oh I am stabbed —I told it to those in the house where I lived—I have said a great deal concerning it since the poor fellow has been dead—I said it to the landlady—she is not here—and to others—I was very much alarmed at the time—I ran down as fast as I could COURT Q You say there was a struggle between them A Yes and Martin twisted the shirt out of Feacy s hands—the struggle between them did not last a moment—they were close together at the time—I was standing behind Martin towards the door—it was not above five minutes after that that the stab was given because Martin said I won t injure him JAMES ALEXANDER TEAGUE I am clerk to the Magistrates of the City of London—I accompanied Mr Alderman Farebrother to this place No 8 Cradle-court Red-cross-street on the day this occurred—I cannot recollect the day of the week—I found the deceased Thomas Martin there—the Magistrate asked him previous to my taking any depositions what he considered to be his state—he said he did not consider he had many hours to live—he was in bed at the time—he said further that he did not expect he should have lived so long as he had—he presented the appearance of a person seriously ill—I should have said he could not have lived long—he presented that appearance to me—Feacy the prisoner was in the room at the time—he was in custody—I administered the oath to Martin and took his deposition in writing—it was read over to him in the Magistrate s presence after I had written it—I asked him if he understood it—he said he did and he put his mark to it Read — Thomas Martin late an inmate of St Martin s workhouse says I was discharged from there yesterday morning—I came here for two children of mine by Susannah Emberson now present with whom I had lived for thirteen years—I came about eleven o clock—the prisoner Feacy was here—he asked me what I wanted—I told him I came for my two children and to move part of the things in this room that belonged to Susannah Emberson—he told me to be off out of his room—I told him It don t belong to you it belongs to Susannah Emberson —Susan told me to take the key out of the door and put it into my pocket which I did—Susannah Emberson went out and fetched a policeman who told me I might remove them—Feacy said I should not—I told him we would have no quarrel it would be settled in a very short way if he would go to a Magistrate which he refused to do—I tied a bed up and took it away—I returned here about half-past three o clock and began to tie up a bedstead—the prisoner tried to prevent me—while I was tying it up I told him he was a scoundrel for ill-using another man s children—Feacy had a shirt in his hand—I asked Susannah if it belonged to Feacy—she said No it is one that was left me by my uncle —I twisted it out of Feacy s hand and threw it on the bedstead—I told him it was not his and he should not have it—he flew to a table which was about three steps off and came up to me and gave me a blow—I found immediately that I was stabbed in the left side—he drew a knife from my side and struck me with it three or four times but I prevented him stabbing me again and threw him in the corner and fell upon him and succeeded in wrenching the knife from him—I do not expect I have many hours to live—I never saw Feacy before yesterday morning Q This examination was taken in the room in which the transaction occurred A Yes it was a very small-sized room not very much larger than the dock—perhaps twice as large including a little recess—I noticed a table there on which I wrote the depositions—whether that had been in the same position or not at the time I do not know—it stood at that time in the middle of the room close to the bed Cross-examined Q You took the depositions of the first witness Mrs Emberson did you not A Yes—she was in a state of excitement at that time—I cannot say in a state of intoxication—she appeared to be suffering from the effects of drink and to be very much excited—that was on the Wednesday evening previous to my taking the deceased s depositions—we had great difficulty to get at the facts from her—she was either labouring under the effects of drink or excitement JAMES LEWIS I live at No 4 Old Goswell-street Whitechapel—I remember Tuesday the 17th of this month—I was at No 8 Cradle-court Redcross-street and heard a noise in the room occupied by Feacy at about a quarter past four—I was in the room underneath—in consequence of a communication from Mrs Emberson I fetched a policeman—the noise was as if a bedstead was being drawn across the room—I heard them taking down a bedstead and I thought they were drawing it across the room—I went for a policeman without going into the room—Sarah Emberson desired me to go—I brought a policeman who was close by at the time—I went into the room with him—I entered the room first—I saw Martin lying on the top of Feacy—as soon as he saw me enter the room he handed me up the knife and said This is the knife and this is the man that stabbed me I took the knife—the policeman has it I believe produced —that is the same knife Cross-examined Q I believe it was immediately on hearing the bedstead removed in that way that Mrs Emberson came down was it not A Yes—I have been examined before the Magistrate—I do not know whether any deposition was taken down in writing—the deceased s words were not Here is the knife it was done with I swear that he said This is the knife and this is the man that stabbed me —I swear those were his words—I was examined the morning after this transaction—Martin had the knife in his hand and he was lying on the top of the prisoner—the prisoner was almost choked—he complained when he got up that he was almost strangled COURT Q Had he any appearance of that kind A Yes he seemed rather faint and he asked for a chair JEREMIAH O SULLIVAN City police-constable No 121 On Tuesday the 17th of Feb I was fetched to the house in Cradle-court in the afternoon about a quarter past four o clock—when I went into the room I looked round and saw Martin lying in the corner of the room—I asked where the man was that stabbed the other—Martin said I have got him here you take care of him —I took the prisoner into custody—at that time the prisoner was lying down under Martin and I took him—I produce the knife—this is the knife—I received it from Lewis the last witness WILLIAM PONDER I am a surgeon and live at No 54 Redcross-street City On Tuesday afternoon the 17th of Feb I was called to Cradle-court—I found Thomas Martin there—I saw him in the corner of a room lying onthe prisoner—Martin said I am the man that is stabbed and this is the man who has stabbed me —Martin then showed me a knife and said This is the knife that has done it —I then assisted the wounded man to a chair—the prisoner was given into custody of the police—Martin became faint when sitting on the chair—I immediately laid him down—the faintness increased very rapidly he became perfectly collapsed the skin cold and damp and the extremities and without any pulse perceptible—after using means for resuscitation he gradually revived—a temporary bed was made for him on which he was placed—I then examined the wound after taking off the belt which he had round him at the time—I found the wound as I thought between the eleventh and twelfth but I have since discovered it was between the tenth and eleventh rib—I had the assistance of another medical gentleman Mr Parnell of Charterhouse-square—we afterwards examined more minutely and found that the wound passed obliquely downwards probably to the extent of an inch or an inch and a half—I could not exactly say at that time—I rendered him every assistance that could be done for him and he was removed to the hospital next morning about one o clock—I superintended his removal and took every care that his person should not be shaken in any way—I saw him every day after that but the day on which he died which was Saturday about a quarter past eleven o clock—I saw him when dead on the Sunday about two o clock in the morning in the dissecting-room—the wound did not penetrate the thorax—I said it did at the police-court but I had an opportunity of correcting that afterwards—it was such a wound as might be produced by a weapon like that and in my opinion the wound was the cause of death—I have not the least doubt of that myself Cross-examined Q How long was the wound A I should say probably from three quarters to an inch the appearance of the external wound—I considered the wound to have been an inch and a half in depth—it had the appearance of a stab—I observed blood upon the knife—the knife passed first through the band of a thick pair of trowsers afterwards passing through the belt before entering the body—it passed through the trowsers and afterwards the belt—the wound was about the position of my waistcoat pocket between the tenth and eleventh rib—I should say midway between the breast-bone and the back-bone—the effect on a person receiving such a wound would be to make him faint probably not immediately—in this instance however it did not have that effect—I should have supposed that the immediate effect would have been likely to create faintness—it would be the natural consequence of such a wound that a man would feel faint almost immediately afterwards I should have expected faintness would have been produced COURT Q Supposing that knife to have gone the depth you describe might not the blood have been wiped off the knife through its coming out again through the trowsers and belt A I should say a considerable portion of it would—I saw the body after the examination—five minutes probably—I was not there at the time—from what I saw on examination and of the wound before I entertain no doubt whatever that it was the cause of death JOHN BEVERSIDE HILL I am house-surgeon of Bartholomew s-hospital On Wednesday the 18th I attended the deceased Thomas Martin—I found a wound on his left side between the tenth and eleventh ribs which was bleeding at the time of his admission—the pulse was very small and feeble—he was very pale and complained of pains in his stomach on his admission—I attended him subsequently up to the time of his death every day—he died on the Sunday the 21st a few minutes before eleven o clock in the evening—I made a post-mortem examination of the body and found the wound in the situation I describe about mid-distance between the sterum and the back bone—the abdomen was penetrated and the spleen one of the organs in the abdomen was penetrated and the contents of the spleen poured out into the cavity—there were about two quarts of blood in the abdomen—the intestines were stuck together by recent inflammation—the immediate death arose from inflammation of the serous membranes which line the cavity the peritoneum—the wound was in my opinion the cause of death—no doubt of it—it was such a wound as might be produced by an instrument like this knife Cross-examined Q I believe you did not consider it was so dangerous at first A Yes I did—I had very little hope of his recovery very slight indeed—I could hardly give any hope at all COURT Q Is that a dangerous part of the body to inflict a wound upon A Any part of the abdomen is dangerous—I did not remove the belt from the body STEPHEN SAUNDERS I am a City-policeman I produce a belt which was brought to the workhouse by a person—I do not know the person—I have seen him perhaps MR PONDER re-examined This is the belt I removed from the body—it was penetrated—the inside was very much covered with blood—the blood would follow immediately from a wound of that kind MR HILL re-examined Faintness would immediately and necessarily follow on such a wound being inflicted in that part of the body GUILTY of manslaughter Aged 48 — Transported for Life 
t18460615-1238  1238 JOSEPH CARTER was indicted for the wilful murder of Joseph Oddy and also charged on the Coroner s inquisition with the like murder MESSRS HUDDLESTON and BALDWIN conducted the Prosecution HENRY MATTHEWS I am a copper-plate printer On Tuesday the 19th of May I went to the Crow New Union-street Little Moorfields at nine o clock—there were several people there—the prisoner came in I think a little before ten—John Oddy was there when I first went in—I knew them both before—I have drank with Oddy several times—he is a shoemaker or something in the leather line—the prisoner wanted to drink out of a pot of beer which stood on the counter belonging to Oddy and his companions—he went to take it up—Oddy said he should not have it and told him to go and work for it—he called him a spunging beggar and said he should have no beer from him—the prisoner appealed to a wooden-legged man another shoemaker to know whether he was a spunging beggar—the man said I don t know Joe I never saw you spend much —there was then a laugh and kind of ridicule—they stood talking and wrangling like together the prisoner Oddy and five or six more in a cluster round the bar—I did not take particular notice what it was about—I did not hear any abusive language—it was chaffing and wrangling mixed together—a few minutes after the first attempt the prisoner tried to take the pot up again—Oddy then took it up and held it at arm s-length with one hand and kept the prisoner at a distance with the other that he should not get bold of it—it was not done violently—I did not see him move out of the position he stood in—there were no blows—the prisoner stood a minute or two then muttered something gave his foot a bit of a stamp then turned and went out—he came back again in I suppose ten minutes or a quarter of ar hour as near as I can tell—he pushed the door open with his arm and looked in—the wooden-legged man who stood there went towards the door to him and said Do you want me Joe —the prisoner said something I did not bear what and nodded his head towards Oddy—Oddy then went towards him and as he went a man standing at the side of the door said to Oddy Mind Jack what you are about he has got a stick or a poker behind him —the prisoner eould hear that—Oddy went on and said I will stick him meaning that be would take the stick from him—he then went out at the door—the people inside ran out at the other door—I followed Oddy out at the same door as he went out at—I do not think anybody else went out at that door—Oddy went towards the prisoner—in going out at the door the prisoner backtd away from the door till he got within a foot or two of the corner of the street five or six yards from the door—when Oddy got to the prisoner he put his left hand on the prisoner s shoulder and the other behind him to feel what he had got under the tail of his coat saying Give it us Joe or something like a man —I heard the words Like a man —it was said quite in a calm manner—the prisoner then punched him as I thought two or three times in the stomach—I conld not say how many times—Oddy drew himself in and said he had a severe blow he was stabbed—the prisoner was tripped up by a man and as he went back a knife went out of his hand down a grating behind him—I could not see that it was a knife at the time but I heard something fall—I put my arm down the area and got a knife up which I gave to the policeman Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q I believe the deceased was tipsy A I did not see him so fresh as he was at that time for some time before—I believe all the persons there were shoemakers—they were chaffing and joking within a few minutes—the prisoner was rather fresh—I cannot say how many men were with the deceased—I was not with him—I did not see the wooden-legged man take some coppers from the prisoner s pocket nor hear of it till now—his name is Wood—they call him Tom Wood—I saw him at the corner of Newgate-street to-day Q On the prisoner s return after going away did not one of the party say to the prisoner Now then shopmate here is the beer and pretend to offer it to him A I think there was something of that said—I cannot say I saw the pot drawn away when he went for it—the prisoner seemed vexed when he came back—he drew back as Oddy went to him—the whole party got up to go out expecting there would be a row as is generally the case with shoemakers when drunk they generally have a fight—the man who gave the caution went out—when Oddy said I will stick him he might have said I am determined to see what the rascal has got —it was something of that—I think he did use the word rascal —he was going to the door at the time—I did not see him collar the prisoner—I saw his hand on the top of hit shoulder and the other round him and on that I immediately saw the punches in the belly JURY Q Was there any blood on the knife A I was so flurried I gave it to the policeman immediately—it was a sharp pointed shoemaker s knife SAMUEL BOWDEN I am a boot-closer and was at the Crow on the 9th of May in company with Oddy—there were fourteen or fifteen there altogether—I just remember the prisoner coming in—we were drinking porter—I was talking to a person and leaning against the bar—I looked now and then and there was a little talking between them—I heard that Carter wished to drink and Oddy told him he was either a spunging beggar or character and refused to let him drink—there was a little bit of a scuffle but no blows it was keeping him off the pot as he wanted to drink a second time—he called him the same as before—the prisoner turned round to Wood and said Joe do you know me to be a sponger —Wood said I never knew you to be anything elie —the prisoner made a bit of a stamp with his foot on the floor and left the house—he came back in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he stood outside the door with the door bent in and Wood said Do you want me Joe—he said No I want Oddy —previous to that somebody said he had a poker and somebody said he had a stick behind him and cautioned Oddy not to go—Spencer held a quart pot out with some beer in it and said Joe come in and drink and be a man —Joe said No I shall not —Oddy then followed out and I being the furthest from the door was one of the last out—when I got out the injury had been done—the first person who spoke to me was Oddy—he said Bowden I have got a violent blow in the belly —the prisoner was down on the ground at that time—I do not know whether he heard it Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Oddy I suppose was quiet all the way through A He was in liquor and the prisoner had been drinking evidently he was the worse for liquor—I did not hear Oddy call him a rascal—he did not catch hold of him in my presence—I have broken my arm—that did not happen on this occasion I slipped down on Sunday fortnight coming out of the Crow—I had been drinking then and might be drunk—when Oddy went out I went out with the rest to see what was going to happen between him and the prisoner—I was sober THOMAS SPENCER I am a boot-closer and was at die Crow talking to Oddy when the prisoner came up to him—Oddy said to him I will give you none of this beer go home and work for it as I do and called him a spunging fellow—I was quite sober—I had not been there ten minutes—the prisoner turned round to Wood and said Tom did you ever know me a sponger —Wood replied he never knew anything better of him for he never had any money—there was no abusive language on Oddy s part—Carter stood on the right hand side of Oddy and used some very abusive language to him—no blows were struck—Carter went out—in about three minutes I and two others followed him out—he went to the right towards White-street—as he walked along I heard him make the reply D—your eyes I will fetch something that will do for you Q You call it a reply did anybody speak to him A No—but Oddy Shaw and me stood on the curb and we laughed and we thought that was in reply to our laugh as be turned round on our laughing and used that expression—I saw him come back in I should say from seven to ten minutes—we bad then all three gone back to the house—he came and looked in at the door—I saw bis right hand under the tail of his coat—there was a man sitting on a tub by the side of the door who said He has got a stick or a poker behind him —Wood walked towards him and said Do you want me Joe —he replied No Oddy —I was talking to Oddy when I heard the reply—I turned round and looked at the man—I took up the pot stepped towards biro and said Here shopmate drink come in and be sociable —he said No I shan t —I then went up to Oddy and said I will go out at the other door and see what he has got and as I stood at the other door he beckoned with his head towards Oddy—Oddy stepped towards him and said What do you want with me and followed him out—as I was going out at the door I saw Oddy step off the step—I said to Oddy Do not go near him I think he has got a knife —I then saw bim make a thrust at Oddy with his right hand—Oddy was doing nothing with his hands at that time that I noticed in the least—I did not observe his hands on or near the prisoner—they stood within a very short distance of one another—I put my hand on the post at the corner of New Union-street seeing the prisoner backing towards New Union-street and I tripped him up—he fell on his back and the knife fell from his right band JAMES SHAW I was at the Crow and saw the prisoner take hold of the pot which Oddy s beer was in—there was a chaffing and wrangling—I went oat with Spencer when the prisoner went out—we all laughed together and Carter said D—n you I will fetch something that will do for you —he went towards White-street—he lives in Reynolds-court Ropemaker-street—he was going in a direction for bis own house which is a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards from the Crow—he came back in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I saw him come to the door—I did not hear him call Oddy—Wood went to him and asked if he wanted him—he said No —he beckoned towards the deceased with his head—Spencer offered him some beer—I saw Oddy go out to him and Carter backed out with his right hand behind him—Oddy followed him for two or three yards—Spencer exclaimed For God s sake Jack don t go near bim he has got a knife —the prisoner instantly gave Oddy a thrust on bis left side—he was about half a yard from him at that time Cross-examined by MR BALLAKTINE Q You are in the shoe business A Yes—I was joining in laughing and jeering at the prisoner—we laughed at what he said not making fun of him—I did not see any money taken from the prisoner s pocket MR HUDDLESTON Q What were you laughing at A Carter said to Wood What do you know of me —Wood said I know nothing of you but a

standing near the door outside the counter—I was inside the counter—she observed the meat in the scale and said to me That will not do that is how I ruined myself the first week I took the shop by wronging myself like that —she came inside the counter—I put the knife and fork on the counter and told her I did not understand it—she took the knife and fork took the meat from the scale and put it on the counter and while she was cutting a piece off it Crawley put 2d into my hand—I put it on the counter and said There is 2d —she said That is not the price of the meat it is 2 1/2 —Crawley said to me That is right countryman is it not —I said I do not know there is the mistress —Crawley was then standing with his right elbow on the counter and leaning against the wall—he wanted the meat—she would not give it him—he said he wanted it and insisted that it was right but she put it behind her on the shelf—she was talking to him—I do not particularly recollect what she said at the time—it was only a word or two—she put her hand to his face once or twice and said You blackguard I do not want your custom and to be off—Crawley remained in the same position leaning on the counter—the prisoner had the knife in her hand at the time—she was talking to him and I saw her shove her arm across the counter and stab him—I saw the blood and for a moment after I could not see Q When she stabbed him did she say anything A She put her arm across all on a sudden and said There is a halfpennyworth you b— —Crawley cried out went to the door of the shop and the prisoner threw the knife over the counter on the floor and I picked it up—it was the same knife that she had cut the meat with—the constable came in immediately Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Whether the man wanted the meat of not you do not know but he said he came for meat A Yes he asked for it—I never bought meat there—I do not know whether the price was 10d a pound—she said it was—she was tipsy—it might be a little after twelve o clock at night—I had stopped there since ten or half-past ten o clock—the prisoner was not drinking while I was there—I had not been drinking myself—I stopped there after it took place for fear they should think it was me that did it—there was a crowd of people there—I knew the prisoner by seeing her about—I know nothing particular about her—I did not live in the house—I heard a row in the street—it might be a good while before this—I was inside and heard people talking outside—that was after the man came in while he was in and before he was stabbed—there was a mob all along the

were lying in the shop—the man was an Irishman—I cut him very good weight—I was not used to weigh meat—the prisoner complained that I had cut too much and took some of it away—after that it was full weight—he was then standing at the counter and she inside it—there was no more than what I call joking and laughing between them—Crawley was leaning with one hand on his face and the other on the counter—she stood opposite him inside—I heard her call him a blackguard and say she would not have his custom—when she was examined I did not hear her say that he had put his hand to her person—I did not see him do so—tbe counter is about two feet wide—I did not hear him say when he was leaning on the counter Nance many a good spree have you and I had together and will have again —I was sober—I had had no drink at all—the shop is not very large—I did not hear one or two words that were said—I did not take such particular notice as to hear that—when she used the knife she said Take that you b— not you blackguard —it was at the time he was leaning with one hand on the counter and the other to his head—he put the 2d into my hand I put it on the counter—I do not know which took it up—I did not see it taken up—I did not see all that took place on the counter—she told him to be off a backguard she did not want his custom—I did not hear her say that several times—I might have had a drop of beer at my work but not shortly before this—I went there to get something to eat—I sat down and had a basin of soup—it was a sudden thrust HENRY FRANCIS VAN SPREEDINGBURG I was at the prisoner s shop between one and two o clock in the middle of the night—I went for half-a-pound of pork but it was not done enough and I put it back—Crawley came in and asked for a quarter of a pound of the same pork—Brown cut some for him and put it into the scale—the prisoner was standing outside the counter near the door—Crawley produced 2d —who he gave it to I cannot say—I saw it on the counter and heard the prisoner say she wanted another halfpenny—I did not see Crawley offer another halfpenny—the prisoner took the meat out of the scale and put it in a dish—Crawley said Give me my meat I will give you 1d which will pay for a slice of bread as well —the prisoner was then on the door side of the counter—he did not produce the penny and she told him to leave the shop—after that I asked for half a pound of beef which Brown cut and put in the scale and the prisoner said there was more than weight—she went inside the counter—it was my meat that was over weight—Brown laid down the knife and fork—she took the meat cut a piece off and put it into the dish—Crawley was then standing next to me in front of the counter leaning over the counter—I heard him say to the prisoner Nance you and I have had many a spree together and I hope we shall have again —he said so several times and she told him several times to go away—I cannot say I heard her call him a blackguard—I was in the act of leaving the shop after having mustard put on my beef by Brown and saw the prisoner make a plunge at Crawley with her hand—I cannot swear I saw anything in her hand—I was not going out—my face was towards the counter but my eye was not fixed on her further than seeing her arm plunge towards Crawley across the counter—this was almost immediately alter the mustard was put on my meat—I was nearly facing Brown who was by the prisoner s side—she mentioned some words when she made the plunge but what it was I cannot say—directly the plunge was made he walked out of the shop and said Save me save me I am stabbed —Brown came round the counter and I saw a knife in his hand stained with blood Cross-examined Q You say it was pork Crawley came for A Yes—I had been drinking—I cannot say I was tipsy—I do not know what became of the 2d —the prisoner appeared to have been drinking but she could see there was too much meat in the scale—there had been no row at the door shortly before to my knowledge—I went there between one and two o clock - there was no mob there when I went in—I was not there at twelve Q Did not she say Take that you blackguard or something A She mentioned some word at the time she made the plunge—what I cannot say GEORGE KING I was a police-sergeant—on Saturday night the 3rd of Oct between twelve and one o clock I was in Flower-and-Dean-street—there was a disturbance in the street—I remained there about an hour till this occurred which was at half-past one o clock—I was outside the shop about ten minutes after the disturbance and Crawley passed me and went into the shop—in four or five minutes I heard an exclamation in a man s voice as if in pain—the deceased ran out of the door with his left hand on his right side in a stooping position—he called to me I am stabbed I am stabbed to the heart oh save me save me —I took hold of him and led him into the shop—Brown and the prisoner were behind the counter and the last witness in front—I put Crawley on a chair and took the prisoner—she said I will go quietly with you —I asked Brown for the knife—I found it among some lumber at the back of the shop—the blood was on it wet and moist—another constable took the prisoner to the station—I took Crawley to the London hospital and gave him in Mr Holman s charge—I returned to the police-station—the inspector read the charge to her and said she had no occasion to say anything unless she liked but if she had anything to say he was willing to hear it—she then said Mrs Sanderson sent him to break into my place and what I have done I might do to protect myself —Crawley was not present at the disturbance in Flo wer-and-Dean-street—the first disturbance was between Mrs Sanderson and her lodgers and the second disturbance was between Sanderson and the prisoner—when the depositions were taken before the Magistrate the prisoner said Crawley had taken indecent liberties with her that she had the knife and fork in her hand and did not know she had done it—this was at her first examination before Mr Broughton—the deceased gave the name of Daniel Crawley-at the station WILLIAM HENRY HOLMAN I am a surgeon—the deceased was brought to the London hospital—his shirt was covered with blood—I found a wound on his left breast—he lived six days and a half—I have no doubt his death was caused by that wound—I made a post mortem examination GUILTY of

Prosecution RICHARD EATON I am a cane-stainer and live in Cock-ally Shoreditch On the 17th of March about ten minutes to ten o clock I went with James Badkins and William Gobart the deceased to Hare-alley where the prisoner lives—when we were at the top of the court Gobart asked me to go and call the prisoner—I went and called out Tom Bill wants to speak to you —the prisoner came down and came to the top of the court—Gobart asked him for his things he had helonging to him which were locked up in his box that was the first thing that was said—the prisoner said he should not give them till such time as he paid him and he did know that he should give them to him then and if he stopped there a minute he would put a bullet through his head—I turned round and said to Gobart Bill I am going I am not going to stop to be shot at —I left him and went to my own place about twenty yards off in the next court—when I left the prisoner was going down the court—Badkins and Gobart remained—the prisoner s house is about twenty feet from the top of the court—I went up stairs and in not more than two or three minutes heard the report of a gun—James Badkins came and called me—I went down stairs went up Haare-court and saw Gobart lying in a pool of blood in the court—he drew his breath—I did not hear him speak afterwards—I did not see the prisoner then—I went for a doctor Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Had there been a row in the court about robberies of cane committed A No not in my hearing but three weeks before Christmas somebody came to my master and stated that I was robbing him—I asked him to give me in charge—I begged and prayed of him to give me in charge and he would not—I went to the Mansion-house to get a summons against my master—they could not do anything unless I entered an action and being a poor man I could not do that—Badkins did not work at the same place as me—Gobart did—I called him Gobart before the Coroner and grand Jury—Gobart could have gone to the prisoner without me Q You did not ask him what he wanted with you unless it was to provoke and annoy the prisoner A No I never had a word with the prisoner—I was there all the time till I heard him say he would put a bullet through his head—I did not think the prisoner meant what he said when he said he would put a bullet through him—I did not go to provoke a row—I did not expect any rowat all—on my oath I have told all that passed MR CLARK Q How long had you been in the deceased s company before you want to the top of the court A All day—I was not in the court before the deceased came—I do not know how to spell Gobart s name COURT Q Did you come first into the court with Gobart A Yes I was with him all the time till I went away—I was there all the time the prisoner was present—the deceased and I had not come away straight from our working place—he had not been away from me—we left work and went to the Admiral Vernon in Long-alley and then went down to the prisoner s house—we had not parted—I am quite sure nothing passed in my hearing but what I have said—I was sometimes two or three yards off—I saw no young woman pass—I saw one sitting down at the prisoner s door but did not see any one pass JAMES BADKINS I am a boot-closer and live in Shirt-lane Shoreditch—I knew the deceased On 17th March I was at the top of Hare-alley about ten o clock at night—when I got there the prisoner the deceased and Charles Eaton were all three there—I did not see Richard Eaton—the prisoner was about four yards down the court against a post—Eaton was close by him—after I got to the top of the court I heard deceased say to the prisoner I will give you a punch of the head —the prisoner said then If you stop there a minute I will put a bullet in your head —no blows were struck or aimed in my presence—Gobart had his hands in his pocket when he said so—after the prisoner said this he went into his own house—I remained at the top of the court with Globart—he was going down the court I said Bill don t go down for fear you should be shot —he said What have I got to be afraid of —I then followed him and was against the shutters—he went opposite the prisoner s door and said Tom and there was a gun fired directly—I only saw the flash and heard the noise—I did not see the deceased fall—as near as I can guess that was about ten minutes after the prisoner said I will put a bullet through your head —nothing had taken place during the ten minutes nothing was said—Charles Eaton and me and Gobart had stood still in the court for ten minutes not talking together Cross-examined Q Had you been at a public-house with them before you fell in with them in the court A No the first thing I heard was the deceased say to the prisoner that he would punch his head—I do not know what had taken place before that—there appeared to have been some quarrel between them but I did not come in time to hear the beginning of it—I knew Eaton and the deceased by being in the same street and living close by—I heard nothing said about a robbery—I never mentioned Gobart threatening to punch the prisoner s head till I was examined before the Magistrate—I do not know whether I mentioned it before I was crossexamined by the prisoner CHARLES EATON I am the brother of Richard Eaton—I was with him at the top of Hare-court and the prisoner and deceased who was my cousin on the night of 17th March—I was not there when the prisoner came—he was there when I got to the top of the court—I did not go to the court with my brother and Gobart—on my coming up I heard

door—nothing was said or done by the deceased before the shot was fired—he had not spoken—he fell and I fetched a constable Cross-examined Your cousin the deceased went down to the door of the prisoner s house in your company and never spoke a word A Not in my hearing—he did not begin by calling out Tom—he went on to the threshold of the door he was going into the passage but did not get in—the first thing that I heard pass was the prisoner saying if he stood there a minute he would put a bullet through his head—Gobart never said a word about doing anything to him MR ROBINSON Q How

touch him—I went from my own door into Shoreditch—I live at the Shoreditch end—I stopped about a minute came back again and there were about half-a-dozen people at the top of the court—Charles and Dick Eaton were two of them—I did not know the others—I heard them say if they had a b—y goof gun like TomBrooks they would give him a b—y good bullet and blow his b—y brains out or if not they would

Tom Brooks was he alone A Yes—he could not see the prisoner at that time—I asked the prisoner if I should say he was there—he said Do not tell them I am here I will go up stairs and come down again —Dick Eaton swore at the prisoner and said D—his eyes and said he would have his life at some time or other but I do not know what it was about MR CLARK Q The prisoner said Do not tell them I am here who is them A I do not know—Dick Eaton was the only person in the court at that time—it was that same night that Eaton spoke about taking the prisoner s life but before Bill Gobart came—DickEaton was in the court a goodish while before Gobart came—it might be a quarter of an hour or more COURT Q You went into Shoreditch twice did you at any part of the time go to the head of the court where they were standing A Yes before I went into Shoreditch the first time I was then as near to them as I am to the jury-box—while I was there Gobart struck the prisoner on the forehead—that was as I was coming rather away from them—I happened to turn my head and saw him do it—the prisoner said I do not think it worth my while to touch you and Gobart wanted him to go down to Cock-lane and also to

prisoner and deceased in the street out of my window—I heard him ask her to go and have some gin—they went out my sight to a public-house—I did not see anything more of them till about five o clock

is on the first floor—she was sitting on the stairs which are very dark—I could not see anything the matter with her till I brought her down and took her into my landlady s front room on the ground floor—her under garments were very wet with blood—there was much blood—she seemed to be swollen in the face—she could not sit or stand but when she was tipsy which was her habit she could not stand or sit—I cannot say whether she was sober or not at this time for I had not seen her from half-past two till five—I considered at the time that she was tipsy and told her so—I saw no other signs of her being hurt—the landlady fetched a policeman and she was taken to the London Hospital—her clothes were bloody—she had a chemise on and the top of her gown but she was not in the habit of wearing many clothes because she used to take them off and pawn them—I have seen her in that state before—I also saw blood on the side of her head and her nose was bleeding—I removed part of her dress but observed no marks or hurts or other appearances—she had been away ten days and nights before this—the prisoner had been at home—her child who is eight years old was very bad with a fever at the time—I saw no more of her till she was dead—I considered the prisoner was very kind to her while she kept sober but it was very seldom she was sober—he was very kind to her but she had a very bad tongue and used very bad words to him—I only observed blood on her nose until after I saw her dead at the hospital—I saw a cut on the right side of the head Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q What is the prisoner A A shipcarpenter and joiner—there are two floors to the house—they occupied the garret I a room on the first-floor and the landlady a room on the ground-floor—the prisoner and his wife only had one room—I saw nothing of them between half-past two and five o clock—I had been in the back room on the ground-floor during that time—when I went up stairs at five o clock I did not see the prisoner

came from her on the stairs—it was not on the stairs till after I went to her COURT Q On what stair was she when you saw her A I think on the third stair—that was near her own room-door—I heard them quarrel about pawning his trowsers before she went away CHARLOTTE HOOKHAM I live at No 8 Raymond-place St George s in the East The prisoner and his wife lodged in the attic at my house about twelve months—on Saturday the day of her death about half-past two o clock she was in my room—the prisoner put his head into my room saw his wife and said There you are mother —she said Yes —he said Will you come up stairs I will forgive you for all you have done but he said Where are my shoe-brushes and she said I have sold them he said That is just as you do everything but never mind mistress I will forgive you for all —she said Mac you are drunk I know what you are —I said to him Mac if you touch your wife if you beat her I will come and tear you to pieces —he said Mother I won t strike her may God strike me dead if I touch her —she said I won t come upstairs unless you give me a pint of beer —he said I will give you a pint of beer or half-a-pint of gin if you will come up stairs —he said to me Mother will you have any —I said No Mac don t bring any in here for none shall come in here if I want any I can treat myself —they went out and I saw no more of them till the afternoon at about a

shift—she said she was very much hurt—she was all over blood from the bottom of her shift up to her hips—I saw a discharge of blood from her person and could not look any further—her face appeared very much larger than common from being hurt—I did not notice any blood about it—I cannot say whether she was sober or not then—she had no help in her at all—I should say that arose from her being hurt because when she was brought down stairs she said Oh my belly my belly I am dying —I saw a blow on the right side of her head it was either a blow or kick—the scalp was quite naked—she was left lying on my floor till she was taken to the hospital—I did not see her again alive—I afterwards saw blood on the stairs from the top to the bottom and on the side of the wall—after she was taken away

they were drunk they quarreled—the woman drunk very hard—that was the cause of it—when drunk they would quarrel and fight—he would beat her because she would make away with everything—she never beat him—she was very abusive with her tongue when drunk but not at all when sober—when he came into the room at two o clock she said he was a whore-master—she appeared to be sober then—I never heard her call him names when sober Q How long had she been away A Nine or ten days—this was not the first he had seen of her in his return—he had seen her during that time and coaxed her up stairs many times—she would watch her opportunity when he was away to go up stairs break the door open and get what she could—she had been in the house several times in the course of that morning but that was the first time she saw her husband—when she said she had sold the brushes he said That is just as you do everything —it was then she called him a whore-master—he said Ah Mistress that is the way we fall out this is the way you aggravate me but come up stairs I will say no more —he did not appear to be quarrelling with her at all—I am quite certain that when she came down her clothes were all off her back except her shift—she had the top of her gown and her stays and her shift on—she had nothing more on at half-past two—she had her gown and clothes on at two o clock but when brought down to me she had no gown on the lower part of her—I took a light at five o clock as the stairs are very dark—I went to see if there was anything on the stairs and saw blood—I never knew her to fall about the

money for medicine COURT Q How near the time the deceased was brought down had you seen the boy A I had seen him before she was brought down—I did not see him in the room where his father and mother were myself—I did not see him come down stairs—the first I saw of him was in the mangling-room playing JURY Q Had the woman been entirely absent from home ten days A No—she came in repeatedly in the course of the day and sometimes she would come in late at night and say Oh Granny I must stop with you but I said You must not COURT Q She had occasionally come home and refused to come home but when she went out she broke the door open and took out his things and sold them A Yes—she came home every day when he was out during the ten days but did not sleep at home—she did not see her husband then—it was while he was at work—I do not know whether he saw her at all during the ten days but she came during that time broke his door open and took his things—it was on the Saturday afternoon that he coaxed her to go up stairs and she would not—that has happened repeatedly before not during the ten days but on former occasions JOHN SHEEHAN policeman On Saturday the 8th of may I was called to a house in Raymond-place—I went with the sergeant to the ground-floor belonging to Hookham and saw the decreased on the floor—her face was all over blood—there were several marks of blood on it and a cut about an inch long on the back of her head—it did not appear to be a serious one—I observed a bruise by her ear—the skin was merely cracked—there was part of a carpet thrown over her to cover her—I did not see her dress—the sergeant asked if she wished to have him charged—I heard her speak and considered she was drunk—that was not from her manner of speaking but from her appearance—I had never seen her before—I assisted in taking her to the hospital—I did not see her afterwards—I could not form an opinion whether she was hurt so as to occasion death—she had marks on her—I did not return to the house that night—I saw the prisoner about ten minutes after I was called in lying on the bed up stairs in his room—I went up without a light and could not see the state of the stairs as it was very dark—Sawyer was with me—he spoke to him—he did not say he had better tell the truth—he said M Donald what have you been doing to your wife laying his hand on him and shaking him as he appeared to be going to sleep—the prisoner said she was constantly getting drunk and spending his wages—Sawyer said Come with me —we took him to the station—on the way he said After all I know she will not appear against me —on the Monday following at the Police-court before the Magistrate a pair of books were taken off his feet—I cannot say whether they were the same that he had on when I took him—I think it was on the Monday following—I was called in on the 8th of May and it was the Monday next following the Saturday that the boots were taken off—the inquest was held after that Cross-examined Q He appeared to you to be drunk when you saw him on the bed A As if he had been drunk and was getting sober—he appeared sleepy and drowsy JOHN M DONALD the prisoner s son being questioned by the Court did not appear to understand the nature of an oath and was not examined JOSEPH NASH I am a surgeon at the London Hospital The decreased Agnes M Donald was brought there in a very faint cold state—I examined her and found the head chest and belly very much bruised—the cartilage of the nose was separated—there was a wound on the right side of the head about an inch in length—it was not very severe—it was superficial—the third and fourth ribs on the left side were fractured and the private parts very much bruised—there appeared to be a rupture of some of the viscera—as she was suffering great pain in the belly and was in a state of collapse—there was a discharge of blood from the vagina and she was bleeding from the head from the cut on the right side and from the nose—the cartilage of the nose might have been divided by a blunt instrument—the knuckles would do it—I attended her till she died which was in fourteen hours—there was a post mortem examination which I attended—I found the vessels of the brain very much congested gorged with blood the third and fourth ribs fractured the intestines ruptured and traces of seven inflammation of the membrane covering the intestines—the rupture of the intestines must have been caused by great violence—a kick or a jump on the belly or a fall against the floor or against a chair of table might produce it—it was very extensive—a fall with great violence against the ground a chair or banister would occasion it—the wound on the head was not severe—there were many bruises on the head—it would be impossible they could have been caused by a fall—there were several bruises on the belly and chest—it was not one continued bruise but several—one blow arising from a fall could not occasion those several bruises—I ascribe her death to the rupture of the intestines—her hands and arms were very much bruised—some of the bruises were recent and some of long standing—the bruises in the private parts would very likely be the result of a kick—that would produce them or if she had fallen across a table or chair or bannister or any hard substance it might do it but she must fall across it to do it—I do not think a person merely falling with violence would receive such an injury—the rupture of the ribs and the congestion of the brain were very severe—they contributed very much to her death I imagine—from the time she came in she was too weak a great deal to be capable of being examined Cross-examined Q You say the fracture of the ribs might have shortened her life if there had not been rupture of the intestines but you attribute her death to the rupture of the intestines A yes—some of bruises were recent and some of them of five or six days standing—those in the head were very severe—the temporal muscle on the right side of the head was complete pulp—the fractures of the ribs were recent decidedly—I am quite positive the inflammation of the membrane covering the intestines was very recent—the intestines are not easily ruptured it must be done by direct violence—if they were ruptured by disease there would be traces of disease—the intestines would not be more liable to rupture whether a person was drunk or sober there would be no difference—a fall might have produced many of the bruises—a single fall could not produce them—a drunken person falling from side to side against different objects might produce many of them—it is not at all likely that the edge of a stair would occasion the rupture but I have not seen the stairs—the edge of a bedstead might produce a bruise on the private parts if she fell across it but it is not to that bruise that I attribute the rupture of the intestines but to the bruise immediately over the rupture—that might be produced by falling against the edge of a stair or a table chair or bedstead or by direct violence of any kind—it was a bruise of some extent—a fall repeated once or twice might produce bruises of similar extent COURT Q From the general appearance taking into account all you saw the bruises on the head separation of the nose rupture of the intestines and the appearances on the chest belly and private parts according to your judgement could all those bruises have occurred from a fall or succession of falls A I do not think it possible—I ascribe death decidedly to the rupture of the intestines—the injuries independent of that were not likely to cause death—those bruises causing the rupture of the intestines might arise from a fall or a succession of falls—they must have been falls of great violence—if a person staggering when drunk fell against the corner of any hard substance with sufficient violence it might produce the appearances I saw but not without—it would be impossible unless they fell against some hard substance—if she was intoxicated she would fall very heavily and then if she fell against any hard substance the violence might be sufficient to produce it EDWARD BILESON I am an inspector of police The prisoner was brought to the station—I read the charge to him—I made him no promise or expectation of benefit or injury to induce him to say anything—he said he struck his wife that she fell down stairs—I said it had been told me that he had kicked her and jumped upon her—he denied that Cross-examined Q The charge was assaulting his wife A Yes—she was not dead then WILLIAM SAWYER police-sergeant I saw the prisoner on Saturday evening about six o clock—he appeared to have been drinking very freely COURTO MRS GRAY Q You say found her on the third stair how did she get down from the third stair A I took her down in my arms down both flights of stairs—she was able to move but was very weak indeed—she put her feet down—she did stand with my helping her under the arms—she did not walk at all—I dragged her more than carried her down GUILTYof Manslaughter Aged 46 —Recommended to mercy on account of the great provocation received from his wife— Transported for

t18470614-1389  1389 HENRY JONES HARRISON was indicted for the willful murder of Ann Ford —2nd Count describing her as Ann Harrison —He was also charged on the Corner s inquisition with feloniously killing and slaying the said Ann Ford MR CLANKSON conducted the Prosecution SARAH JONES I am a window and live at 6 Dunstan-place Ratcliffe I knew the deceased Ann Ford for about eighteen months—she lived with the prisoner in the same house that I lived in—last Saturday month I think it was between ten and eleven o clock at night as near as I can guess she asked me to go to market with her—I did so—we were gone about half-an-hour—I think it was near upon twelve o clock when we returned—we both had our laps full of things butter tea sugar cabbages potatoes and other things—I went up to her room with her—we got in by the door—it was shut—she pulled the panel of the door out—that had been broken a long time ago—she then put her hand in and unlocked it—she did not kick the panel of the door out—Mr Harrison had kicked it out—we went in and she put the things on the table—the prisoner was then sitting on his chair asleep as I thought—he had not been awakened by anything we did not make any noise—on her putting the things on the table he got up—he never spoke a syllable nor she either but he flung the things out of the window—she did not say or do anything—she was going out of the room he hopped across the room after her knocked her down with his fist against the landing-place and then kicked her—she had not said or done anything to him while he was throwing the things out of the window—I cannot say where he kicked her—she did not speak when she was kicked—as soon as he did it I ran down stairs for a policeman and saw no more of it—she remained on the ground when I ran down—I was frightened and did not go up again—I was gone not above five minutes if so long—I did not go up again—I stopped down stairs in the parlour—I did not see her on my return—the policeman came and went up stairs—a young woman named Ann Kitchen went along with him—she is not here—I did not go with him—I saw the deceased the next day Sunday—I cooked her dinner—she was then in bed and appeared very bad indeed—I saw her again on Monday she was then getting worse and worse—I attended her till her death which was on a Sunday morning at one o clock—the prisoner desired me to attend her and gave me 3s a week for it—I got the first 3s and I got no more—she lived three weeks to the very day—I did not hear the prisoner use any expressions towards her before he got up and knocked her down or any bad word come out of his month COURT Q Are you sure you did not hear him say anything A No I did not but when he returned again into the room before I got out he gave me a knock over the head and said D—my eyes I will serve you the same —I never mentioned this to anybody only to the people of the house—I was stunned by the knock he gave me Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Had you been drinking A No—I had been out at my son s—I had had nothing to drink during the whole night—I had not been into any public-house with the deceased—I had gone out with her between ten and eleven o clock marketing—when I came back I found the prisoner s door fastened—she knocked but we could not get in—we got no answer—then she got the panel out and got in that way—we found him asleep he started suddenly up from his sleep and threw the things out of the window—neither of us spoke—she was frightened of him and I was afraid to speak when I found he was in such a pet and knocked her down ELIZABETH MARY DALCHON I am the wife of Joseph Dalchon of No 6 Dunstan s-place—he keeps the house I remember the prisoner coming home to his lodging the night the deceased was beaten—he lived with her—it was as nearly as I can guess about ten o clock—I lit him up stairs and when he got into the room he locked the door and I heard him say that no one should come in that night—the deceased was then out—he did not inquire for her when he came in—he was in liquor—the deceased came in in about half-an-hour—I lit her up stairs and told her that Mr Harrison had come home—she knocked repeatedly at the door and asked him to let her in—he never answered—the panel of the door had been broken open nine months or so age—they had fastened it inside very temporarily—the deceased pushed in the panel of the door—Mr Ince was then on the stairs not where we were she was on the other stairs—this was a middle room—there are two flights of stairs to the house—the deceased removed the panel and then could reach the key and unlock the door—the prisoner did not wake as we heard—he did not speak—I went to the door—I did not go in—the prisoner never moved out of his chair—it was after that that the deceased and Mr Ince went to market together—I remember their returning with some articles they had purchased—I let them in and they followed me into my room which is the front parlour and showed me their marketing—I then list them both up stairs again and they went into the room—the deceased has fastened the door again so that she could let herself in—she got in without any difficulty—the door was open—they unlocked the door themselves—she had locked herself out when she went out and when she came home by putting her hand inside she got in each way alike—I had only got from the stairs into my room when I instantly heard a scuffle—I was in the parlour underneath—I had gone down after lighting them up—I ran to the bottom of the stairs to see what was the matter and saw Mr Ince coming down stairs as fast as she could crying—I then heard the deceased crying at the top of the stairs and calling Police and Murder —I heard her say twice before the policeman was fetched Oh Harry you have murdered me —that was while Mr Ince was gone for the policeman—I afterwards saw a bundle of wood and two or three potatoes out in the road—the policeman came—he went up stairs and I went away again—I do not know why I did not go up stairs—I stood by the parlour-door—the deceased continued to cry after the policeman left—I heard the prisoner s voice several times after the policeman left—he came down to look for the policeman—I heard him say at the time he was in a passion it appeared to me when he was hitting her I will do for you you b— —that was before the policeman came—I heard him say it several times during the night—I heard him say it before the policeman came after Mr Ford and Mr Ince had gone up when I went to the bottom of the stairs—I heard him say it several times in the course of the night but not till after I first heard the scuffling—there was a second scuffling after the policeman was gone—two policeman came—only one went up stairs—that one went away and did not return again—one policeman came to the door and went away instantly—he did not go up stairs—after he went away I again heard more scuffling—the prisoner came to the bottom of the stairs to look for the policeman to ask him if he wanted a shilling—I heard him say that because it was at my own door—I heard him quarrelling with the deceased after that—he made use of bad language to her several times calling her out of her name and such words as I said just now—their room was over my head so that I could hear the scuffling and wrangling—after the second policeman was gone I heard him scolding her and telling her to hold her noise because she was groaning—I heard him swearing and telling her to hold her noise—I heard her all night groaning until the morning—it was late when it happened—it was early when they went out in the morning and I could not rest at all—my bed is under them and I heard them as I lay in bed—I heard her say to him in the night Oh my stomach Oh my stomach the whole night—I did not hear her say anything else that I can call to mind now—she was using just the same sort of language all night groaning and making complaints about her being in such pain—I heard her say several times in the night Oh you have murdered me Harry Oh you have murdered me —I was not examined before the Coroner Cross-examined Q On the second occasion when Mr Ford came home with these things was the panel still out A Yes—it had not been replaced—there was no necessity for her to break it open again only gently to remove it—it was not fixed in again—she broke it in the first time—the prisoner was very drunk when I saw him—the deceased was not in the habit of being out late at night—Mr Ince fetched a policeman—the first policeman did not go up stairs—he only came to the door and went away again—I do not know how that was—I do not know whether that was the policeman Mr Ince brought—she did bring a policeman—he went up stairs and went away again—I do not know whether that was because she would not give him in charge—I never heard her give him in charge—the policeman said he went away because she would not give him in charge—I did not hear him say so—I did not go up stairs—my sister lit the policeman up—I did not hear why he went away—I made a communication to him and after that he went away MR CLARKSON Q What did you tell the policeman A That I wondered he did not take the charge—that was to Barry—he said she would not give him into custody PATRICK BARRY police-constable K 78 On Saturday night the 15th of May about half-past eleven o clock I was called to No 6 Dunstan-place—on arriving at the door I heard screams of Murder and police from the first floor—I took a light and went up stairs—when I got on to the landing the deceased came from the door of the first floor front room—she appeared to be sober—she pulled up her petticoats and said Oh my belly he has kicked me —the prisoner stood at the door at the time within hearing—he asked me what brought me to the room—I told him I would let him know if he did not keep himself quite—I asked the deceased if she would give him in charge—she said No and I came away—I did not feel myself justified in taking him in charge after her refusal Cross-examined Q I presume you saw no mark whatever A No—if the deceased had given him into custody I should have taken him—I should not take upon myself to apprehend a person unless I actually see the violence committed—she pulled up her clothes so as to show me where he kicked her—I saw no mark there EDWARD BILSON I am inspector of the K division of police In consequence of directions received from Mr Ballantine the Magistrate on Wednesday the 2nd of June about twelve o clock I went to No 6 Dunstanplace Ratcliffe and found the deceased and the prisoner there—I took him into custody Mr Cleland the surgeon was also present—he told the deceased she was in a dangerous condition and any statement she made would be taken down by me in writing by the direction of the Magistrate—she appeared to understand what Mr Cleland said to her—she then made a statement in the presence of the prisoner—I took down from her lips accurately what she said—she was not sworn—she made the statement herself in answer to my saying that I was directed to take down any statement she had to make relative to the injury—I read it over to her and saw her sign it—she was not told that she was in a dying state but that she was in a dangerous condition—the prisoner said nothing in the course of the statement she made— the court held that the statement could not be read ALLAN CLELAND I am a surgeon and live at Ratcliffe On the 17th of May I was called to attend the deceased—I found her in bed labouring under a great deal of inflammation of the peritoneum—I attended her till her death—she apparently improved for about a week—when I first examined her there was a sight yellowness about the pit of the stomach but I was very doubtful whether that was the result of an injury or not—after the end of the week she became much worse the pains returned with a great deal more violence than at first the bowels appeared to swell very much—that indicated effusion in the cavity of the abdomen—those symptoms increased till she died which was last Sunday week early in the morning—it did not appear to me that she was labouring under any other complaint than that which she communicated to me—after her death I made a post mortem examination—I examined the gall-bladder and found it ruptured—that was the primary cause of death—that would cause inflammation of the peritoneum which was the immediate cause of death and would be followed first by severe pain and then by effusion—a violent blow would be very likely to cause a rupture of the gall-bladder or any other violence externally applied—the rupture was about half an inch in extent—I did not detect that injury till after death—that would be quite impossible—the symptoms would show inflammation and violence but the nature of it could not be detected till after death—I examined the viscera generally and found them all healthy with the exception of the liver—I found no injury about the liver that would account for death—the tinge of yellow on the stomach was very nearly over the gall-bladder—I examined the head—there was nothing about it to indicate any cause of mortality—the rupture of the gall-bladder was quite sufficient to account for the death Isabella White a widow who had known the prisoner three years and a half gave him a good character GUILTY of

t18490409-1047  1047 WILLAM BAILEY was indicted for the wilful murder of Henry Casson Lamboll He was also charged on the Coroner s Inquisition with the like offence JOHN LAMBOLL I am the father of Henry Casson Lamboll the deceased—I identified his body at the hospital last Monday morning—I stripped down his clothes and saw on his left breast just by the heart a small wound about as big as my nail JOSEPH MURRAY I am a smith and live in Orange-street Southward I knew the deceased about five years and the prisoner longer than that—they were good friends together On Sunday evening 9th April I was in thair company at the Mitre in Broadwall for four or five hours drinking—we all left the Mitre together about twelve o clock or a little after and went to the Duke of York in Blackfriars road—we staid there about an hour and a half and left about two—there was a dispute there between the prisoner and deceased about 5s —the prisoner had lent the deceased 5s —I heard him ask him for it several times—he said Give me the 5s and I will lend you 1s —he refused to give it him and said he would give it him on Saturday night—the prisoner seemed rather angry—a pot of beer was called for and it was partly upset by the prisoner—the landlord came round the bar and threatened to turn him out—I told the landlord if he would let him go I would endeavour to get him home—we all went out of the house together the prisoner the deceased myself Harriman and James barker—we went along Blackfriars-road towards Rowland Hill s chapel—I cannot tell who went first or how we walked for we were all in liquor—I think the prisoner and deceased were on a-head and I was walking with Harirman and Parker—the prisoner and deceased seemed very friendly together further than the prisoner s asking for the 5s once or twice in going along and the deceased saying he would return it to him on Saturday night nothing else occurred till we got to the end of Charlotte-street—we were in the act of going home wishing one another Good night and when I had got about three yards distance I heard the deceased say I am stabbed I —I went back to him and found him resting on Harriman and I saw the prisoner step back from him with his face towards him—I did not hear him say anything—I assisted in taking the deceased in a cab to St Thomas Hospital and when we got there the surgeon pronounced him quite dead Cross-examined by MR COOPER Q Were the deceased and the prisoner friends during all the time you knew them A To the best of my knowledge I always considered so—the Duke of York is 300 or 400 yards from the corner of Charlotte-street—the prisoner and deceased walked first and we close behind—when we got to Charlotte-street we turned our backs and went in different directions—we were all very nearly drunk—we could walk very well—we did not tumble about at all—we had had no spirits only a drop of beef to smoke our pipes over JOHN HARRIMAN I am a watch-glass maker at 1 Bates -buildings Broadwall—I was at the Duke of York on the Sunday before last—we left between two and three in the morning—I had been drinking—I walked with Murray and Parker towards Rowland Hill s chapel—the prisoner and Lamboll were on before—they were not friendly together—they were talking about 6s —the prisoner said to him that he would have his 5s —Laraboll said he should not have it then he would give it him next week or next Saturday evening—the dispute continued up to Charlotte-street—I was about to go home from there and had to turn to the fight—Murray had to turn to the left up Union-street—we wished one another Good night —I was about to cross to the right when I heard Lamboll say George he has stabbed me —I directly turned back to him and saw the prisoner step back from him and lean his back against a lamp-post close to the corner of Charlotte-street—before I reached Lamboll he had fallen to-the ground—I raised him up with his head on my knee he never uttered another word—he had been a very-particular acquaintance of mine—Murray and Taylort took him to the hospital in a cab and I walked there and there heard that he was dead—I saw him last Friday evening in his coffin at his brother-in-law s Cross-examined Q Had you known the prisoner to be a friend of Lamboll s A Yes they were great frineds and there was great good feeling between them—I have known prisoner twenty years—when sober I never saw a quieter man—I had not got many yards from them when I heard the deceased say George he has stabbed me —I did not go up to the prisoner or speak to him JAMBS PARKER I am a cooper and live in Surrey-road I was at the Duke of York and left about half-past one I do not believe it was two with the deceased the prisoner Harriman and Murry—I Harriman and Murray were walking together behind the deceased and the prisoner—when we got to Charlotte-street I had to cross and go straight on—I parted company with the others and said Good night all —when I get against the Dog and Porridge-pot at the other comer of Charlotte-street I heard a voice say I am stabbed —I could not say who it was— I tamed to go back and saw the deceased standing and I saw the prisoner retreat two steps backwards—when I got up to the deceased I saw that he was stabbed through his coat waisteoat shirt and flannel-shirt—seeing that—he was stabbed and seeing the prisoner step backwards I seized the prisoner by the collar and sung out for the police twice as loud as I could—I gave him into the hands of the witness Bartlett who came up and went to the deceased and helped to put him into a cab to go to the hospital—he could not walk to the cab he was carried into it—I did not hear him speak again GEORGE BAHTLBTT On the morning in question I was-at the corner of the New Cut on the opposite side of the way to Charlotte-street and heard spipebody call out Police —I went across to the person who was calling and inquired what was the matter—it was a female she pointed to the prisoner and said That man has stabbed my husband —the prisoner heard that he was close by—Parker had him by the collar—he gave him into my charge and I gave him to a policeman Cross-examined Q Did you see anybody besides the man s wife near the prisoner at that time A The other three men my wife crossed the road with me—the prisoner seemed the worse for liquor—he appeared as if he hardly knew what he was about COURT Q Did he walk away with the policeman A Yes he did not walk very well—I do not think he spoke a word—I did not say a word to him when I laid bold of him—my-attention was drawn to the-man on the ground—I saw nothing in the prisoner s hand MARY TAYLOR I was living with Lamboll—I was standing outside the Duke of York and paw them all together—I followed them up to Charlotte-street only on the other side of the road—I was watching him to see if he would come towards home—I saw him and the prisoner walking on-first in front of the others until the corner of Charlotte-street—I-then saw Parker cross the street as far as the other corner—he stood there about a minute and Harriman was going to cross the road the other way—I saw Parker come back and catch hold of the prisoner and say You shall not go till the policeman comes —he called Police twice before I got across the road—I ran across when I heard him call Police and while I was crossing Lamboll fell—when I got up to him he was on the ground with his head on Harriman s knees—I tore open his shirt and saw him bleeding from the side—I never heard him speak—I went with him to the hospital—he sighed in the cab as we went along ISAAC COGGINS I am a dresser at St Thomas s Hospital I was there when the deceased was brought in on the Monday morning at ten minutes past two—I was called up by the porter and saw him in the surgery lying on his back perfectly dead—Meek the policeman was with him and Mary Taylor—he had a stab about two inches below the left nipple between the fifth and sixth ribs and about two inches to the left of the breast-bone—the wound was about half an inch in length it was an incised wound and was in an oblique direction—I could not at that time tell what it had penetrated I could only surmise—it had ceased to bleed—his waistcoat and shirt were bloody—an examination of the body was made next day in my presence by our demonstrater of morbid anatomy—on introducing a probe through the external wound it was found to have taken a direction upwards and backwards to the extent of about two inches in depth—on removing the sternum and portion of the ribs it was found to pass beneath the cartilage of the fifth rib which was slightly cut—it was then traced through the pleura or the bag which contains the lungs in which we found twenty-five ounces of dark-coloured blood—that would be at the bottom of the cavity as the man laid on his back the blood would gravitate there—it was then traced through the peritoneum or the bag which contains the heart and on opening the peritoneum it was found to have gone through the wall of the right venticle about two inches and there was also twelve ounces of the same coloured blood effused into the peritoneum—it was venous blood—a man could not survive such a wound as that Cross-examined Q You say it took an oblique direction did it appear to be done by an instrument pointed upwards A Yes I should say that it was made in an upward and inward direction—the deceased was a fine roan five feet nine inches high I believe—he was a well-formed young man and well-proportioned—I should say he was three or four inches higher than the prisoner or more JOHN MEEK policeman M 48 I heard Taylor screaming Murder and Police and ran to the spot—I saw Bartlett holding the prisoner—I asked who had done it—I looked on the ground and saw the man bleeding-Taylor said That is the man pointing to the prisoner—I immediately laid hold of him by the two collars and said Have you got a knife about you —he said No yes I have got one in my right coat-pocket —in feeling his left breast-pocket as I laid hold of him I felt something in it—I put my hand in and took from it this knife produced —it was open—I did not see any particular appearance on it—I then put my hand into his right coat-pocket and took out another knife which was shut—I gave him to my brother constable Holmer who came up and I went with the deceased to the hospital BENJAMIN HOLMER policeman M 169 I took the prisoner to the station—nothing passed between us as we went—he had been drinking a little but could walk very well—I should say he knew what he was about ISAAC COGGINS re-examined I believe such a knife at this would have inflicted such a wound as I saw—it it quite long enough—the stab was through the wall of the right venticle of the heart—the situation of the wound was just over the apex of the heart but it took an oblique direction upwards consequently it went in above the apex ELIZABETH LARKMAN I live in Tooley-street Last Monday morning about twenty minutes to two o clock I was coming down Charlotte-street to go into the Borough—I had been over Blackfriars-bridge—I saw the prisoner with another man walking together—I had never seen them before—I did not see any other persons walking the same way with them—I heard the prisoner say If you will not give me the 5s one way I will have ft another way —I then saw him take the penknife out of his waistcoat-pocket and he said to the one that he murdered I want to speak to you —I saw him open the knife—he made a step while he was palling it open—the other was going on—he turned to the prisoner again and asked him what he wanted—he did not make any answer but stuck the penknife tote his side—after he had done that he wanted to wipe the penknife on ray frock—I was close by them—he was going to catch bold of the skirt of my frock to wipe the penknife—I would not let him and he gave roe a shove and shoved me off the kerb and in putting my arm out to save myself a spot of the blood came on the sleeve of my frock—I did not fell—I did not go to the police-court to give my evidence I was not able—from his shaving me off the kerb it jolted my side and caused me such pain I could not go—I went by Rowland Hill s chapel and sat on the step of a door till I was able to walk I was in such pain—I then walked as far as the Borough—I went into a coffee-shop and sat down and stopped there till the morning—I then went to the Court when it was open out I was not able to stop I was taken so bad Cross-examined Q When did you first come forward to give this evidence A I went to the station last night—that was the first time—I was told there was an inquest on the Tuesday morning—I was not able to go there—I was in bed—two policemen led me to St George s workhouse on the same Monday afternoon that this took place—I am an unfortunate girl—I had been in the Royal Oak in Blackfriars-road on the Monday morning nowhere else—I had not been drinking there—I had not been in any one s company that day—I was jn the workhouse from Monday evening till Wednesday morning—I have seen many persons since that day Q Why did you not speak to some one at the time while you were sitting down by Rowland Hill s chapel A No one came no policeman or any one passed me—there were plenty of persons on the other side of the way—I never called to any of them—I told the doctor about it when I was at the workhouse—I have been unfortunate six weeks—I was a servant of all work before—I went to the station last night through telling a young man of it and he told the policeman—I did not know that this Court opened last Monday—I did not see two or three of the policemen before I came here—there was nobody near at the time I saw this act done not a soul—the man s wife was a little distance from them—I dare say she saw me—I did not see any of the other men—I was taken so bad with the pain that I went and sat down and did not see any one else there—I was not for from them—I did not call out at all—I have no mode of getting my living but by going about the streets COURT Q What is the name of the young man that you told of this A I do not know his name—when the man was stabbed he fell down—I did not see anybody come up to assist him till a lot of people rushed up—I went a distance from them towards Union-street—I did not go far before I sat down on the step—I saw some people rush up to him a few minutes afterwards not directly afterwards—I saw a woman standing—I did not know then that she was his wife—she was very near to them when it took place on the same side of the way—I did not see the cab go off—I sat there some time—the people were standing there some time—it was on the left-hand side as you go to the Borough that I sat on the steps the chapel side not the first steps you come to—I think it was the steps of the third house GUILTY of Manslaughter Aged 31 — Transported for Life Before Mr Justice Wightman

t18490917-1734  1734 JOHN BLOOMER WEEKS feloniously attempting to discharge a pistol at Frederick Shipton with intent to murder him —2d COUNT with intent to do him grievous bodily harm —3d COUNT to prevent his lawful apprehension and detainer MESSRS RYLAND and LAURIE conducted the Prosecution FREDERICK SHIPTON City policeman 114 On the afternoon of 4th Sept I was on duty in Basinghall-street—a person named Hammond came to me and as we walked towards London-wall he pointed to the prisoner and said That is the man —the prisoner was then standing on the other side of the street and the moment Hammond pointed him out he took a pistol from his right-hand jacket pocket and before I had time to advance an inch he pointed it towards me and said Stand off for your life one step and I will fire —I rushed on him and when I got about a yard or a yard and a half from him he pulled the trigger but it missed fire—I heard the click of the lock—I did not see the priming burn—I seized him threw him down held him on the ground and Hammond took the pistol from him—the prisoner said It is a good job for you that it did not go off or else you would have had it —on the way to the station he said he would have his revenge—when we got to the station I searched him and he took a bullet-mould from his trowsers pocket and threw it on the desk and I found on him some gun-powder two pieces of iron and a comb—he was quite sober—I afterwards took the pistol to Mr London a gunsmith of 51 London-wall—the charge was there drawn in my presence—it consisted of this powder and ball— produced —I afterwards conveyed the prisoner to Newgate and going down Newgate-street he said he wished he had shot me he would rather be hung for me than have fifteen years transportation for he knew he should have that—I asked him what object he could have in shooting me as I did him no injury—he said had he shot me he should have had his liberty so that he might have revenge Prisoner Q When you took the pistol away did you make any remark A No—I did not say it was a good job it had not gone off you made use of that remark—you did not say it was intended for Mr Lovell—I did not tell you anything about any letters Mr Lovell had against you—I swear you did not say to Hammond that you would do for him and Lovell too—Hammond gave me the pistol and the inspector at the station looked at it—he did something to see if there was ball in it—there was a piece of paper on the top of it which he pulled out—I swear I saw the gunsmith draw the ball from the pistol—he unscrewed the muzzle and knocked the ball out with a piece of iron—the ball could not go into the muzzle MR RYLAND Q Was the pistol ever out of your sight A No—this is the same pistol—I was in uniform Prisoner Q Was not the pistol out of your sight when you went outside to pot the shutters of the station up A I did not go outside to put them up—there is a glass window that I could see through and I saw it in the inspector s hand all the time COURT Q Did you find any ball in the prisoner s pocket A No only an iron thimble and a piece of iron which I produce ROBERT HAMMOND I am in the service of Mr Lovell a clothworker of Basinghall-street On Tuesday 4th Sept I saw the prisoner in Basinghall-street—I knew him by sight before—he was ten or twelve yards from Mr Lovell s house—I also saw Shipton about four yards from him—I pointed out the prisoner to him and said That is him —I should think I spoke loud enough for the prisoner to hear and I said there was a warrant out against him and to take him into custody—we went up to him and when we were within a yard and a half or so of him he took a pistol out of his jacket pocket and presented it I should say at Shipton—I cannot say exactly which of us it was meant for—I was alongside of Shipton—when he presented the pistol he said But another step and I will fire or take your life or words to that effect—I should say he said that to Shipton—we were both together—Shipton had his police dress on—I suppose he spoke to both of us when he said Stand back —he looked at Shipton—he then pulled the trigger and it flashed in the pan—I went to lay hold of him but the policeman darted at him and threw him down and I took the pistol from him—I did not go forward to him before the pistol went off but Shipton did—I did not notice him pull the trigger but I heard the cock and saw the flash—I afterwards gave the pistol to Shipton—Shipton took him into custody and took him to the station-house—in going along I endeavoured to assist Shipton and the prisoner said I will do for you and Mr Lovell before long Prisoner Q Did not you tell me as we went to the station that I had done a pretty job for myself and it would serve me right if I was hung for it A No—I said at Guildhall that I saw the flash from the pistol—I saw the flash was from the gunpowder—it was not the spark from the flint and steel—I did not say as we were going to the station I have got you at last —the warrant was taken out against you for sending threatening letters and annoyance and for presenting what Mr Lovell thought was a pistol at him—the warrant was got out next day—Mr Lovell showed me the letter EDWARD DANGERFIELD I am in the service of the Royal Mail Steam-packet Company On the afternoon of 4th Sept I was in Basinghall-street and saw Shipton and Hammond there and the prisoner—I saw Hammond go to Shipton and he walked across the road to the prisoner—the prisoner then drew a pistol from his side-pocket and presented it at the policeman saying Advance another step and I will fire —the policeman advanced and I distinctly saw the flash in the pan—I did not hear the click—there was then a struggle between Shipton and the prisoner—they both fell and the prisoner was secured—Hammond took the pistol from the prisoner—they then both got up and the prisoner said I have lost my defence I will go quietly —as they were walking the prisoner turned round towards him and said I will have my revenge —he was then taken to the station Prisoner Q How far was I from Shipton when Hammond pointed to me A About five yards—you were not above two yards from him when you pointed the pistol—I heard you distinctly say Stand off or I will fire —I did not hear you say to Hammond on the way to the station that you would do for him and Lovell—I did not hear you say to the policeman it was a good job it did not go off—I was close by—I did not go all the way to the station—I was not at Guildhall WILLIAM ORAM I am in the service of Mr Lovell On the afternoon of 4th Sept I was in Basinghall-street—I saw Shipton advance towards the prisoner to take him into custody—he put his hand into his right-hand pocket took a pistol out presented it and said Stand off for your life another step and I will fire —he pulled the trigger it missed fire and flashed in the pan—I saw the flash—he was taken into custody and I saw the pistol taken from him by Hammond Prisoner Q What did he do with it A Gave it to Shipton—when Hammond pointed at you Shipton was on the kerb on the other side—the street is not more than five yards wide—there is not room for two carts to pass—he was not more than a yard and a half from Shipton when you presented the pistol—Shipton did not make any remark—he ran at you with his head downwards and knocked you down—he was standing upright when you attempted to fire—I did not get under a cart I was by a cart—I did not assist in getting the pistol from you—I was eight or ten yards off when you presented it EDWARD LONDON I am a gun-maker of London Wall On 4th Sept Shipton brought this pistol to me—I unscrewed it drew the charge and it contained powder and a bullet—I gave it to Shipton folded up in this paper—this bullet-mould would make bullets to fit this pistol—I do not think the pistol had been fired although it had been pulled—I do not think there appeared to be any soot on the pan—I think it was clean as it is now—I do not think it had been primed or if it was it was with such poor powder that it would not act as the best powder would—if it had fired it would have blacked the pan—I do not think it could have flashed in the pan—I did not hold the pistol in my hand while I unscrewed the barrel I put it in a vice so that I took no soot off the pan—when I saw it first of all I think it was clean Prisoner Q Was the hammer back at the time A I will not be sure —I opened it two or three times—I cannot say in what state it was when I first had it—I cannot say whether it was on half-cock or down—I think the trigger had been drawn although the powder did not flash—there were the marks of the flint on the hammer—it always leaves a new mark JOHN ROE I am a City-officer attending the Justice-room at Guildhall I produce a warrant issued by Sir Peter Laurie for the apprehension of the prisoner for using threats towards Mr Lovell— read —the prisoner is the party named in the warrant Prisoner s Defence I did present the pistol to the policeman I do not deny that but I deny ever drawing the trigger the witness Shipton said I told him to stand back or I would take his life and if he advanced another step I would fire Hammond though close to Shipton never heard me say so he says today he saw a flash at Guildhall he said he saw a spark the witnesses differ as to the words I used and the gun-smith is not able to say in what state the pistol was when brought to him I saw Hammond go to the policeman I knew Mr Lovell had a warrant against me I saw Hammond tap the policeman on the shoulder I was then just opposite Mr Lovell s door and the policeman might have been twenty-five doors from me I went walking along as if I took no notice of them till I saw Hammond pointing to me saying That is the man I took the pistol from my trowsers-pocket not my jacket and the moment Hammond said That is the man I said And that is the man so stand off those were all the words I uttered I never did pull the trigger neither was the pan of the pistol down when the policeman took it from my hand I believe if the pistol was to be cocked the pan would not fall back it falls but half-way EDWARD DANGERFIELD re-examined I distinctly saw the flash from the powder—I saw the smoke as if from gunpowder—I did not know the prisoner before WILLIAM ORAM re-examined What I saw was the flash from the powder not the sparks from the flint—I saw the smoke and a light ROBERT HAMMOND re-examined I saw the flash from the powder—I did not notice any smoke—it was like sparks or a flash coming from a bit of powder that was set alight GUILTY on 2d and

grievous bodily harm MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM ANDERTON I am a cab-driver On 4th Oct I was first cab on the stand in the Minories—about seven or eight o clock I saw the prisoner coming towards the cab—I asked if he wanted a cab—he said yes be wanted to go to Chiswick—I agreed to take him there for 14s and to stop at any house on the road he wished for—he appeared at that time as though be had been drinking—before we started we went into a public-house—he asked me to have something to drink and I had a glass of rum and while I was drinking it he went into the parlour and stayed there a few minutes—I went and opened the door and looked in and saw he had got some silver before him on the table and as I looked in be put his band over it and looked round at me—I spoke to the landlady—two or three minutes after that we started—we stopped at a great number of places on the road—I went in at most of the places and had something to drink—the prisoner had also something to drink—the last public-house we stopped at before we got to Chiswick was at the Black Lion at the bottom of the lane on the left—I do not think he had anything to drink there—when be came out of the Black Lion he got on the box with me—he gave me no reason for that—he rode on the box with me pretty near all the way—he directed me which way to go—he told me to go round the corner to the right—we had not got a great way before he said Pull up stop here —that was at the gate of a garden in front of a house—it was then about ten o clock—it might be a little before or after it was dark—I bad no light to my cab nor was there any light at the gate that I remember—he told me to ring the bell and ask for Mr Monkhouse and if he was at home to tell him there was a gentleman from town who wished to see him—I did so a female came and opened the door—I delivered the prisoner s message—she asked me the gentleman s name—I said I don t know and looked round towards the cab—he was then off the cab and at the other side of it—the female then shut the gate and went in she came back in about a minute or so and said that Mr Monkhouse said The gentleman must send his name —she opened the gate and said that loud enough for the prisoner to hear—he was then alongside of me and he said I will go in and see him myself and he went in at the gate and shut the gate after him—I pulled the cab closer up to the pathway to wait and I heard the report of some fire-arms—I think I heard it twice I could not be positive—about two or three minutes after hearing the reports the prisoner came swaggering like out of the gate and got on the cab and said Go on to the top of the lane —I asked him what that noise was that I heard that I beard the report of some firearms—he said It is not here there has been nothing of the sort here —I drove to the top of the lane and at the first public-house I came to in the main road I pulled up to demand my fare of the prisoner—I asked him to pay me the fare that I had brought him to Chiswick according to agreement—he said I want to go to the Bell at Ealing drive me to the Bell at Ealing and I will give you a sovereign altogether —I agreed to that but I wanted him to give me half-a-sovereign before I started from there—he said Drive me there and then I will pay you altogether —I did so—I did not know my road and inquired of a horsekeeper there—it was about three or four miles across the country up a lane—I at last got into the high road leading from London to Ealing—as we went along I told the prisoner to mind that he did not fall off the box—he kept rolling about a good deal as he sat on the box—he said I will pay you when you get there —he repeated that several times—the prisoner said he would show me the way to Ealing—he said Straight on straight on I will show you —pursuing that road we came to the Bell—he went in and asked me to have something to drink—we each had a glass of brandy—I asked him to settle with me for it was my time to get home—he said I want to go to my brother s house up this lane drive me up there and I will pay you —that was a lane nearly opposite the Bell—I did so—he got outside the cab again—I drove to a house on the left hand side about threequarters of a mile up that lane the prisoner got down there and I also—the prisoner rang the bell several times I should say ten or a dozen times and got no answer—he then told me to drive him back to the Bell at Ealing and then I should be paid—I took him back—he got upon the box again-when we got to the Bell we both went in—I asked him to pay me my fare—he told the landlord to give me a sovereign—they said no they knew better what to do with their sovereigns that he must pay me—I said I don t look to the landlord I look to you you pay me I want to get home —he said I will pay you —he put his hand into his pocket and walked into the back room—during that time some one called u Cab cab here —I looked out at the door and saw a policeman on horseback who came and took him into custody—I then took him from there to the station-house at Hammersmith Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q At the time he took your cab it was between seven and eight o clock A Somewhere there about I think nearer seven than eight—he appeared at that time as if he had been drinking—he did not roll about he swaggered about a good deal like—he did not appear at all confused when he spoke to me—there was no one with him—I drove from there in the direction of Chiswick—we stopped at a great number of public-houses before we got to Chiswick I should think twenty—he drank I think at all but one sometimes rum sometimes gin and sometimes brandy—I recollect his having a glass of beer at one house somewhere about half way on the road—at the Black Horse at Knightsbridge he left bit handkerchief—I did not notice that all this drink made much difference in him—he was like most sailors when they have had a drop to drink—he had had a great deal—I was sober I knew perfectly what I was doing—I might have been fresh but I was far from being drunk—I was nothing near so drunk as the prisoner was—after he came from his father s house he was swinging about on the cab and I cautioned him lest he should tumble—he said Oh I am all right enough I will pay you your fare I am all right —I thought he had a good deal of money with him when I first saw bio in the Minories—I saw some silver on the table and be got his hand over it—I saw no gold ELIZABETH BAINES I am in the service of Mr Monkhouse the prisoner s father On the night of 4th Oct I answered a ring at the bell when I opened the gate I found a cab there—the cab-man gave me a message—I did not at that time see any other person—I shut the gate and went to the front of the hall door where I met my master—I delivered the message to him and he told me to go and ask his name—I went to the gate again and opened it—I said to the cad-man that my master wished to know the gentleman s name—the cab-man hesitated for a moment and all at once my master s second ton the prisoner rushed past me and nearly knocked me down—he said I am a Monkhouse and I will speak to him —as soon as I had time to turn myself round I saw him at the moment in front of my master close to him-my master was still standing in front of the hall on the threshold of the door—I saw the prisoner put his hand quickly somewhere about his breast in front and take something from it I thought it was a pistol—his back was towards me—I merely saw the movement of his arm—I then saw him fire at my master I saw the flash and heard the report—I heard a second one and my master was just falling while the second one was going off—he was as close to him as he could possibly be—he turned round and passed me and said There —I was so struck I could not move or do anything—I only saw him when he passed me—I never turned to look after him—I was so frightened that I dared not go by my master expecting he was dead—I passed the door he was at and went in at another door—he was crawling on his hands and knees towards the front parlour—an alarm was given and the medical man and the police were sent for JOHN FARMER MONKHOUSE I reside at Chiswick in the county of Middlesex The prisoner is my second son—I have six children five by my first marriage—I have a second wife with whom I am now living I have one child by her—on 4th Oct I remember a ring at the bell—I went to the hall door and remained there a short time—after Baines had given me a message my son rushed in and shot me—I was then at the hall-door—not one word passed between us before it was done—I only heard him say he was a Monkhouse—I could not see with what weapon he shot me—I heard two reports of fire-arms one of them took effect upon me in the throat—I fell down almost immediately I was afterwards taken into the house—I had last seen my son about a week before this occurred—he came to my house—nothing very particular passed between us on that occasion only I told him he should not sleep at my house that night—I was not exactly on good terms with him—he was a sailor in the merchant service—I had been in the navy in early life—I was a midshipman and master s mate—I have quitted the service ever since 1816—the prisoner was apprenticed in the merchant service when he was between fifteen and sixteen—he is now twenty-eight Cross-examined Q Are you quite certain he is twenty-eight or is he only twenty-six A Twenty-eight—his mother has been dead ever since 1831—I believe she died of brain fever—I dare say it was brain fever—I am not certain about it—she left four other children besides the prisoner—I believe one of them keeps a public-house—the prisoner could not have been only thirteen when he was apprenticed—I am surer he was more than that when be first went to sea—I think he went to sea in 1838—he went out as a common sailor—I do not know what they made of him on board ship—he was bound apprentice to learn the sea as it is called—it might be twelve months before be returned from his first voyage or more I cannot exactly say—he went to sea again still as an apprentice—he has been out of his apprenticeship for some time—since that time he has been a common sailor I believe—I am not certain about it either one way or the other—I do not exactly know when he came home from his last voyage—it might be three weeks before this—I do not know where he had come from—I had not heard where he had been to—he had been away about a year and a half—I had not ascertained where he was—I was never a common sailor myself—the first vessel be went in was bound for India I believe—I do not know for certain it is so long ago—he had been at school previous at Mr Hawe s Burlington-house Hammersmith that is a school for young gentlemen—his mother was a gentlewoman—I believe she was not a woman of fortune—I had seen my ion about a week before this occurred that was in the evening it might be about six o clock—he wanted to sleep at my house I declined allowing him to do so and he went away—he was apparently sober then COURT Q Did you state your reason for not letting him sleep there A No yes I beg your pardon I did because I thought he ought to have written a letter of apology for his conduct to me previous to his going to sea the last time MR BODKIN Q Just tell me any reason you gave him at the time A I did not give any reason at all that I know of not a word—I said he should not sleep at my house because he had not written an apology for his conduct prior to his going to sea the last time— looking at a paper this hat been in my custody ever since he was bound apprentice—my signature is to it—I read the paper at the time I signed it-looking at this I should say he was between sixteen and seventeen when he was bound—my first wife had some small property—I derived the property I am now in possession of from my grandfather HENRY REASON policeman T 247 On Thursday night 4th Oct in consequence of a complaint made to me I went to the Bell at Ealing and found the prisoner there—I think I got there at near twelve o clock—found him in a room on the left hand—I do not know whether it was the parlour or not—he was walking up and down the room—I think there was another person there—I do not know who he was—I asked the prisoner if his name was Monkhouse—he said it was not—I then said I suspect you are the man I want I shall take you to the station —he asked me what I wanted of him—I again asked him if his name was Monkhouse—he said No and I took him to the station—as I was going out of the door I met another constable and we led him between us walking to the station which was about fifty yards—he had been drinking a great deal—when we got to the station we searched him and found this pistol which was unscrewed and one barrel in his coat-pocket and these bullets I found in his waistcoat-pocket and a small quantity of powder and a dozen and a half of copper caps in his breast-pocket—I tried the bullets to the pistol and they fitted—on Sunday the 7th from information I went to Ealing and received this other pistol and this powder and flask from Mr Williams the landlord of the Bell—I think the two pistols are fellows—they are both percussion—the barrel I found on him appeared as if it had been recently discharged—when I searched him I found some papers belonging to some vessel with his name on them and I then said I see your name is Monkhouse I shall take you now to Hammersmith Police-court and I took him there—while this was going on at the station he said if he had a brace of loaded pistols he would blow his own brains out WILLIAM WILLIAMS I keep the Bell at Ealing I know the prisoner by seeing him but am not acquainted with him—on 4th Oct he came to my house about eleven o clock at night and went into the kitchen where I was—no one came with him—he said nothing but pulled two pistols from his pocket and a small portion of powder and laid them on the table—I took I them and put them into the drawer—I said nothing nor did he—after that I was called to the bar and when I returned he had one of the pistols in his I hand—I said Fray do not get those things out in a room like this fork I is very improper for you to be handling them about not knowing what I state he might be in—I was then called out again and met Reason—he went into the room where the prisoner was—I afterwards went in again and I Reason then had him in custody—I afterwards gave Reason the pistol that I was in the drawer and the powder which the prisoner had brought—the I prisoner did not sit down at all—he appeared to be very much excited Cross-examined Q Did he walk up and down the room A Merely I stepped about the room I did not notice his eyes particularly—he appeared I rather wild and in a state of excitement THOMAS WILLIAM CHAMBERLAIN PERFECT I am a surgeon residing at Hammersmith On 4th Oct about half-past ten at night I was called I to Mr Monkhouse—I saw him immediately—he lives a very short distance I from my house—I found him in a state that a person suffering under a gunshot wound generally is faint and trembling—I expected he would die in a few minutes—he was standing in an upright posture supported by Mrs Monkhouse and the servant who was holding a bason to his mouth out of which issued a great deal of blood—I undid the collar of his shirt and there found a gun-shot wound with a very large blackened surface—he was coughing and vomiting blood at the same time—the ball appeared to have entered at the front of the neck passed through the handkerchief which I produce and which has a horse-hair pad to it which no doubt deadened the action of the ball in the first instance it would probably have perforated the trachea but the stiffening of the stock appeared to have turned it on one side and it went upwards—it appeared to have been fired at a considerable altitude at an angle I should say of forty degrees at least and after striking on the trachea it went through the membraneous portion of the aesophagus into the cavity of the throat at the back of the mouth it must have struck against the basis of the skull or the cervical vertebrae because it went in at an elevation but came out downwards—it bad met with some considerable obstruction—it went in directly in front of the neck and upwards—what obstruction it met with I do not know but it came out on the collar-bone—it must have passed between the carotid internal and external because it did not cut either or else he would have bled to death—it met with some resistance which in my judgment altered its course—there was a distance of five inches between the two openings—it was a dangerous wound I did not expect he would have lived the night out—I got his clothes off and found the bullet which I produce at the posterior opening—from the blackening round the neck I conclude it had been burnt by the explosion of a pistol or gun—I should say the weapon could not have been more than two feet from him at the time it was fired—I am not the regular medical attendant of the family MR HALFORD I am a surgeon and attend Mr Monkhouse s family I took charge of Mr Monkhouse in conjunction with my partner Mr Bowling after Mr Perfect—I saw him about eleven o clock and found him wounded in the manner Mr Perfect has described—in my judgment it was a dangerous wound—I continued to attend him for about a month—he is now quite recovered except that his voice is more hoarse than it was before Cross-examined Q Did you at any time attend him for delirium tremens A I did not I believe my partner did about fifteen years ago MR BALLANTINE called the following witnesses FRANCIS TILLET MONKHOUSE I am the prisoner s younger brother and live at 83 East Smithfield I cannot say whether I saw him on 3d Oct —I saw him on the 4th about three o clock in the afternoon—I went with him to a fishmonger s and he had some oysters and bread and butter—we stayed there I should say half an hour during that time he was most curious in his manners—he attended to every customer that came—he made observations at the people that were passing and stopped at the shop—we went from thence to many public-houses—he had brandy to drink the whole time—I should say he had at least twelve or fourteen glasses—he bad no water to it—I tried to restrain him that was why I went with him from house to house—he appeared quite intoxicated—he went up to a man who was eating something in the street and offered to give him something to drink—this continued until about five or half-past—I recommended him to take some tea to counteract the effects of the liquor and we went into a coffee-house for that purpose—while it was getting ready he put his hand to his head and complained severely of feeling a great swimming and he fell immediately on the table with his hands and head together—he seemed to be quite in a state of stupor—when the tea came I awoke him and the blood rushed to his face and his face was a deep crimson so much so that I felt quite terrified and asked what was the matter with him—after that we went out of the house he staggered—I asked him to come and have part of my bed-as we went along we came to the Three Tuns public-house—he said he was going to sleep there and so got rid of me it was about half-past five when I left him—at that time he was quite intoxicated extremely so LOUIS SOLOMONS I am an outfitter in East Smithfield I have known the prisoner some time and have supplied him with outfits—on the evening of 4th Oct last he purchased a cap of me—he was then the same as I ever saw him before he was sober—I believe that was about half-past six o clock—I saw him again about seven he was then intoxicated and I advised bin to go to his lodging—he appeared very violent in his manner and very much I excited—I saw him again afterwards—he came to my shop and called me I by name I turned round and he presented a pistol at my head—he let I it off—it was not loaded—that was about half-past seven to the best of my I knowledge—I cannot say exactly Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Did you notice whether it was a I percussion-pistol A I did not I did not hear any cap explode only I the snap of the pistol—I cannot say whether it was a pistol like this I did I not take any notice HENRY THOMAS POWELL I am an ornamental-painter of the Borough I saw the prisoner on the evening of 4th Oct at the Black Horse in Wells-street about dusk—I have known him several years—I offered to shake I hands with him and found him in a very excited state—he had a pistol I which he waved over my head several times—he was very violent—I caught I hold of his arm and tried to persuade him to be a little reasonable—he I stayed there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—we both had a glass I of ginger-brandy at the bar—he had it neat Cross-examined Q You each bad one glass Yes it was about I five o clock as near as possible—the Black Horse is about six or seven I minutes walk from East Smithfield—he went out and left me there—he paid I for what we had—he came alone RICHMOND BROWN I am a painter and paper-hanger at Knightebridge I was at Mr Frearson s the White Horse at Knightsbridge on the night of 4th Oct and saw the prisoner come there with a cabman—I had frequently seen him before—he was intoxicated and rolling about—he rolled J out of the house conducted by the cabman—he left his handkerchief I behind—the landlady offered it to him several times and he would not take I it—he did not appear to know what he was about Cross-examined Q Did he appear to be acquainted with the landlady A Yes they had known each other several years WILLIAM WATSON I am gardener to Mr Atkinson of Ealing On the night of 4th Oct the prisoner came to Castlebar-lodge with a caiman—he was staggering about in the road—he said he was brother to Mr Monkhouse—he or the cabman pulled the bell two or three times—I went and opened the gate and said You can get in here —he said Where and staggered in—he said Stand out of the way for here is a loaded pistol —he pulled it out of his pocket or the waistband of his trowsers—I was notm I his way but I hardly opened the gate wide enough for him to go through—he went up to the house and a few minutes after the cabman came up to the gate—it was between ten and eleven o clock COURT Q Is there a Mr Monkhouse living there A Tea it was the gate of his house that I opened FRANCIS FARNDEN I live at 13 Neville s-road Turnham-green and am a carman On the night in question I was in the tap-room of the Coach and Horses at Turnham-green between half-past nine and ten o clock—the prisoner came in—there was a little fire in the room—he turned himself round to the fire-place as I was going out of the room and when I came in again he presented a pistol at roe and asked if I was afraid of it—I told him I was not—he turned it over a few times in his hand looked at it and put it back again into his pocket—I cannot tell whether there was a cap on it at that time—a short time after he pulled out that or another pistol and pulled the cock back and I then perceived a percussion cap on the nipple—he turned it about—I told him it was not a fit place for such weapons and he turned the hammer down on the nipple again turned it about and looked at it and put it into his pocket—I should think he must have been drunk by the ways of him or something of the kind—he seemed very queer and looked very wild about the eyes at the time WILLIAM ARGENT I keep the Red Lion at Ealing On the night of 4th Oct about twenty minutes to eleven o clock the prisoner came there—he had 3d -worth of brandy and the cabman 2d-worth of gin which they drank on the box—I did not observe anything particular about the prisoner then—after he had drank it he jumped off the box and ran into the house to pay for it and there turned the contents of his pocket out on the counter—he appeared to be very much excited and very agitated looking round in all directions Robert Monkhouse Piper Esq the prisoner s uncle deposed to his good character for humanity and kindness GUILTY on the COUNTS charging the intent to do grievous

assaulting him with an intent to rob MR COCKLE conducted the Prosecution CORNELIUS OSBORNE DODD I am a farmer of Chipping Ongar in Essex On Tuesday 1st Jan I was returning from London to my residence—I had occasion to go through Epping Forest—I saw the prisoners about three o clock in the day just behind the Eagle at Snaresbrook in Wan stead parish on the road that leads to Woodford and Chigwell—I and my wife were in a gig—Joseph came up to my horse took hold of its head and stopped it—I asked him his business—he came up to the side of my horse and I said to him Friend what is your business —Joseph said Your life or your money and immediately fired a pistol—I do not know whether it was presented at any one—he then presented another pistol to me and my wife too and said to me If you don t deliver your money I will blow your brains out —if it had gone off it must have hit one of us—I told him I had got no money—James said Be quick and let us have your money —I kept telling them I had got none—James then began to handle me—I saw a woman before me and I called out lustily—James bad something black in his right band but I only saw the head of it—when I called out to the woman the prisoners seemed a little daunted and Joseph told me to drive on and if I looked back or gave any alarm they would blow my brains out—I drove on and overtook the woman that I had called to—I told her what had happened and told the police Joseph Pearce Q Did the thing that James had hare a black top to it A it had a darkish top—I could not say it was black MARY DODD On Thursday 1st Jan I was returning home with my husband from London in a gig—in passing through Epping Forest I saw the prisoners—it was about three o clock—it might be a little after—they came took hold of the horse and demanded our money or our life and directly Joseph fired off a pistol by the side of me—the discharge did not come very near me—it went down the road by my side—the pistol was pointed by my side—it could not have hit me—it was not pointed at me—we both told them we had got no money—Joseph directly held another pistol pointing to us and demanded our money or he would blow our brains out—I and my husband told him we had got no money and then James came up beside my husband took him by his coat and began to handle him I suppose for his money and my husband called out—James had something in his hand but I do not know what—he took hold of my husband s coat and said he wanted our money or our life—we told him we bad got no money and he told us to be off and if we looked back or made any alarm he would blow our brains out—we drove off—I think they said the place where we were stopped was in Wanstead parish but I do not know—it was a little way beyond the iron bridge THOMAS TWINN On Tuesday 1st Jan I saw both the prisoners about twenty minutes before three o clock not quite a quarter of a mile from where the prosecutor was stopped—they were standing at the corner of the wood talking—they were about five yards from the wood which was behind them—I did not see them come out of the wood JOHN WILLIAM MANNING police-sergeant K 5 I received information on Wednesday 2nd Jan —I apprehended the prisoners with the assistance of a constable on Friday the 4th at Stratford in Essex—I told them the charge—Joseph said How do you think respectable gentlemen like us could be guilty of such a thing it touches us to the heart —I took them to the station searched them and found on Joseph this life-preserver it would break a person s skull—they said they lived in Stepney—I said Stepney is a large place where there —they said Anywhere nowhere where you like MARY DODD re-examined This life-preserver appears like what I saw in James s hand CHARLES ROWBURY policeman K 347 I assisted Manning—on the way to the station Joseph said You have no occasion to hold me so tight I have got no pistols with me now —pistols had not been mentioned nothing had passed to which that observation might apply—we did not go into the particulars of the charge only told them we were going to take them in charge on suspicion of stopping a party on Epping Forest not for firing a pistol—I searched Joseph and found on him a duplicate for a waistcoat and one of a pair of pistols pawned on 2nd Jan in the name of Joseph Pearce in the Commercial-road—I found on him a flask with some gunpowder in it a box of percussion-caps and six leaden pistol bullets Joseph Pearce I did not say I had no pistols I said I am not going to shoot you Witness You said you had got no pistols HAROLD WINGFIELD I live with Mr Walker a pawnbroker of Waterlooterrace Commercial-road I produce this pair of pistols which I took in pledge on 2nd Jan of the prisoner Joseph—this is the duplicate that was given for them I have the counterpart of it—these are the balls of these pistols the pistols do not unscrew—I believe there is a ram-rod to them it is not with them now The prisoners statements before the Magistrate were read as follows Joseph Pearce saith What the police-constable says about the pistols is false what I said was Don t hold me so tight I am not going to shoot you on the day the robbery was

19th Feb I was working for him there—I knew the deceased his wife—I saw her go out that morning between ten and eleven o clock—her husband was then at home—she did not tell him what she went out for—they had bad a quarrel that morning—she did not come home till about half-past five—the prisoner was then at home—she stopped down the court and told the people to call him a child-killer—when she came to the room be asked her where she had been to—she said she had been to her mother s—he said Well if you have been there let us be comfortable and have a comfortable tea and I will give you a drop of wine if you will be comfortable with me —she said Well go and fetch it and he went with a stone bottle—he came back with some wine in it and a sweetbread—the deceased poured some of the wine out into a cup and drank it—the prisoner was frying the sweetbread in a pan on the fire and had a knife in his hand and while he was doing it she told him she had been up to the Court to get a warrant against him and he said You b——r you want to swear my life away and he stuck the knife in her somewhere between the breast and the shoulder—she cried out that he had stabbed her went down-stairs screaming He has stabbed me and ran into Whitechapel—I went after her—a gentleman came up and she was taken to a doctor s shop two doors from the corner of Petticoat-lane—after she had been to the doctor s the street-keeper took charge of her—I then returned with Sergeant Barnes to my master s house and found the prisoner there as I had left him sitting on the opposite side of the fireplace to where his wife had been sitting finishing his tea—she was sitting down at the time she was struck—I pointed out the prisoner to Barnes and he took him into custody—he then had the knife in his hand cutting some bread—it was the same knife he had had while frying the sweetbread—Barnes afterwards came back and took the knife—I had seen the deceased in the morning sharpening the knife on an earthenware pan and she said she was going to cut her throat—that was after they had been quarrelling—the prisoner said Do it and then he took the knife away from her—the prisoner was sober when he used the knife—I have lived between three and four years with the prisoner—the deceased was a sober woman—her name was Charlotte Lovee—I saw her body at the Inquest HENRY BARNKS police-sergeant H 16 On Tuesday 19th Feb between six and seven o clock in the evening I was in Whitechapel—I saw Woolcot following the deceased who was bleeding from a wound in the neck and was holding something to it—she said she had been stabbed—Taylor the street-keeper took charge of her and I went with the boy to No 4 Boar s Head-court and found the prisoner there taking his tea—he was cutting a slice of bread from a quartern loaf with a knife—the boy pointed him out to me—I said I should take him into custody on a charge of stabbing his wife—he said I know all about it he hoped he had not hurt her—I told him I was afraid he had inflicted a deep wound—I took him to the station returned and took possession of the knife—on the way to the station he said The knife that I was cutting the bread with was the one that I stabbed her with —there was a slight mark of blood on the handle of the knife but it has got rubbed off—there were marks of blood on the stairs—the woman was afterwards taken to the hospital—I saw her there—this is the knife produced JOHN WYATT I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital On 19th Feb at seven o clock in the evening the deceased was brought there—she was in a state of partial collapse and was bleeding from a punctured wound on the right side of the neck about an inch below the jaw—she was very much exhausted—it was such a wound as might have been produced by a stab from this knife—it was about three-quarters of an inch long and about three inches deep—she lived till the 27th—when she was first brought in it did not appear a mortal wound on account of the slight bleeding—I made a post mortem examination of her body and the cause of death was inflammation caused by the wound—the wound completely transfixed the larynx or gullet—it did not pass through the carotid artery but so close to it that it was to be seen pulsating—there was an extensive abscess on the opposite side of the wound which was the result of the inflammation Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Did you have any conversation with her about the wound A I may have told her that I hoped she would get better or something of that kind—that was when I first attended to her—I did not then think the wound was a fatal one—I remained of that opinion until violent inflammation supervened about three days after—I knew there was a wound in the gullet but I did not know it transfixed it till I made the post mortem examination—it was almost impossible to ascertain it without MR CLARKSON Q On the 20th did you consider her or not in a dangerous state A Not in immediate danger—she was very desponding from the time she came in—she constantly said she did not expect she should get better NORRIS VINE I am principal clerk at Worship-street police-court I remember Mr Hammill the Magistrate going to the London Hospital on 20th Feb and seeing the deceased Charlotte Lovee there—there was an examination taken—nothing had been before said by the deceased as to her expectation of recovery—the prisoner was present—the statement was the result of questions by the Magistrate—I took it down from her lips as she gave the answers in the presence of the Magistrate—it was then read over in the prisoner s presence and she then put her mark to it COURT Q Had the prisoner the opportunity of cross-examining the witness A Yes and he did put one question to her—it was signed by the Magistrate in his presence Cross-examined Q Did you administer the oath A Yes in the presence of the Magistrate and the prisoner— the statement was here read as follows I am the prisoner s wife I was married to him in 1832 I had been out on Saturday 19th instant and returned home in the afternoon I met him coming down the court with another man I told him I had been to Arbour-square and had seen Mr M Kenzie to get a warrant for him he said If you want a warrant I will give you getting a warrant I afterwards went to a public-house and had a pint of fourpenny ale with my husband and we both went home together and I got tea ready and he went and bought a sweetbread and some wine and I was frying it at the fire and just as I was about to pour out a cup of tea he said to me again Where have you been and I said Why Lovee I will tell you the truth you had beaten me so in the morning that I really did go to the police-court for a warrant He said Oh you did go to the police-court did you I said Yes and I saw something go to the right side of my neck I felt no pain but blood immediately flowed from my neck and as he was taking away his hand from my neck I saw the little whitehandled knife in his hand

t18500506-922  922 ALEXANDER MOIR was indicted for the wilful murder of Susan Moir he was also charged on the Coroner s Inquisition with the manslaughter of the said Susan Moir MESSRS BODKIN and CLERK conducted the Prosecution JOHN JOHNSON I was journeyman to the prisoner in March last He resided at 25 Brydges-street Covent-garden—on Friday 22nd March I was in the bakehouse which is under the shop and parlour—the prisoner and his wife slept in the back-parlour I believe—I believe the upper part of the house was let out to lodgers—I went to the bakehouse about eleven o clock—I was in bed when I was called—after I went into the bakehouse the prisoner bolted the door after me—he was in the habit of doing that—I could not then get to the parlour or other parts of the house—I was to call the prisoner at three o clock—after I had been in the bakehouse about half-an-hour I heard noises in the parlour—I heard mistress screaming as if she was being beaten—she was screaming very loud and it continued till about three as from a person in pain not all the time but time after time—I did not hear any words—I heard also a wrestling on the floor as if a person was dragging another about—that continued from time to time about twenty minutes at intervals during that time—I heard the dragging and screaming at the same time—it appeared as if the person who was dragged was the person who screamed—it was my mistress s voice—I heard my master talking very loud but I could not make out what he was talking about—I think the screams came from the parlour—at three I knocked at the ceiling to call my master—he came down—I did not say anything to him about what I had heard or he to me—he stayed about an hour and a half in the bakehouse and then went up-stairs again—I remained in the bakehouse and heard nothing more that night—I saw the prisoner s wife in the shop about eight when I was about to go out with the bread—her face was in a very bad state indeed all swollen and bruised and there was a cut at the side of her left eye—it was not bleeding—I then went out with my bread and saw her again when I returned between ten and eleven—she appeared then just the same as when I saw her in the morning—she appeared rather heavy and looked as if she was not well—I saw her again about six in the evening in the shop—Mary Ann Bryant was present—Mrs Moir was standing at the shop-window attempting to take some bread out of the window and as she turned round she fell on the floor—she did not strike against anything—she fell clear of everything—Mrs Bryant asked the prisoner who was present to lend her assistance to assist her up—he said Let the d—d b—h lay there till she comes to herself —he did not assist her to get up in my presence—Mrs Bryant assisted her up and I then left the shop—I never saw my mistress again—I saw the prisoner between nine and ten next morning—I asked him how mistress was—he said she was in a very bad state and had been all the night and he did not expect that she would live and he was astonished that it had lasted so long as it had done—I was only there one week—this took place the first week I was there—I went on the Sunday before this happened Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q What did the prisoner s family consist of A His wife and two boys one about seven and the other about thirteen years of age—they occupied the parlour and bedroom adjoining the shop the ground-floor and the bakehouse—they kept no servant—I was not put to the prisoner to learn my trade—I had learnt it—I was his journeyman and had been so to other bakers before—it was rather a small business—he had to be up at three o clock to attend to it—I had to be in the bakehouse from eleven till that time—he never took my part of the work from eleven till three—he remained there the whole day after three for any thing I know—generally speaking bakers bolt the journeymen into the bake-house—I do not know whether that is because they are afraid of the bread being left—I saw the deceased the worse for liquor once while I was there—that was about the middle of the week—I cannot exactly say what day about Wednesday or Thursday—I cannot say that it was the day before this happened—it was between three and four in the day—my master was not at home and she was down-stairs telling me about the baking—I am not aware that there was any one in the shop—she did not roll about that I noticed—she showed me she was the worse for liquor by her speech—she spoke thick—she had no marks or bruises about her face then—she had no appearance of violence at all—she had a black eye on the Sunday morning when I went—that was the left eye—I did not observe her stagger when she left the bakehouse—the children occasionally served in the shop MR CLARK Q How long did she remain in the bakehouse A A few minutes—I do not know whether any one was left in the shop MARY ANN BRYANT I am married—my husband is a carpenter and joiner—I am second cousin to the prisoner s wife—her name was Susan Moir—they occupied the shop parlour and kitchen all on one floor and the bakehouse underneath—from the street you go into the shop from there into the parlour from there to the bedroom and then into the kitchen—they are all on one floor—the parlour is a large room the other two are small—I have been in the bakehouse but I am not aware whether it extends under the whole—they have two boys one thirteen and the other seven they slept in the kitchen—I called there on Saturday 23rd March about one o clock as near as I can tell—the prisoner was at home and his wife also—his wife appeared very ill indeed from being knocked about as she informed me on the previous night—the prisoner was not there when she said so—he went out—her neck was swollen very much and her hands were a very dark colour bruised—I am not aware whether she had a black eye or not as she wore spectacles I could not see—I think she was thirty-nine years old—I cooked the dinner that day and the prisoner returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I was in the habit when I went there if there was anything not ready to do it for her to give her a little time to rest—the dinner was very nearly ready when the prisoner returned—the youngest child told his father that the eldest would not take out a baking his mother had desired him to—the deceased was then in the parlour standing by the table and the prisoner began swearing at her d—n—g and bl—g her eyes and hitting her in the back with his fist and boxing her ears with his open hand—he boxed her ears at least a dozen times—they were violent blows each almost enough to knock a person down—he said he would make her remember not sending the man with the baking—she said she thought she should do wrong by sending the man as he was making the York biscuits—she stated that at the first commencement—some time after that they sat down to dinner and he said of the gravy that was made for the mutton-chops This is something like gravy not like the soup you made yesterday and then he began beating her again on the side of the face and ear with his open hand—he struck her three or four times I dare say—they were about the same sort of blows as before—they then both sat down to dinner and the two children—I did not—the prisoner then threw a piece of bread at her and it hit her forehead—it was about the quarter of a half-quartern loaf just as you would cut it half crust and half crumb—the eldest child picked it up and put it on the table—the prisoner took it up and threw it again but it did not touch her—just before they sat down to the table he told me he had been very much put out with her that on the Friday evening she got very much intoxicated and that he had left home to go out and ordered her to shut up the shop and she did not shut it up as he ordered her and when he came back he shut up the shop and went into the parlour and she was frying soles and she said she was very glad he had come in as she had got some nice fish for his supper and he told me that he told her he did not want the fish and that he sat down on a chair by the fireplace and he saw a gingerbeer bottle standing under the pianaforte and he went and took it up and put his finger in and found it was full of gin and that made him very vexed and that when he asked her where she fetched it from she said from the Cheshire Cheese —the deceased said she did not fetch it from the Cheshire Cheese but from a house in Middle-row Holborn—I told her I did not think she had brought it herself at all but I thought a Mrs Doe had brought it to her—she said she had not she had brought it in herself—I told her she had better tell the truth for it would save her a great deal and say who did bring it in for her for I felt sure she did not bring it in herself—she said she did bring it in and she got her little basket down and showed us the manner in which she brought the bottle in—I thought she could not have brought it in because the prisoner said there was no cork in it and she showed us how she put it in her basket to bring it—when he first beat her about the eldest child not going out with the bread he also kicked her violently at the back part of the body—that was before they sat down to dinner—he kicked her at the back part of her person and on her legs—he struck her at least a dozen times—he did not say or do anything more then and the cloth was cleared and he went to get the bread for the eldest boy to go out to Camden-town with—the deceased then prepared to dress herself and he came in and got his pipe and sat down by the fire—she went into the bedroom and I remained in the parlour—he did not say or do anything to her then and I sat talking to him by the fire—after the bread was thrown she did not want to finish her dinner and he said if she did not sit down to her dinner and finish the meat that he would send for a rolling-pin and force the piece of meat down her throat—she then sat down but did not finish the meat—she put it on the dish again—he then got up and kicked her and boxed her ears—he struck her three or four times in the back-part of her person at the bottom of the back her sitting-place—they were very severe blows with his open hand—she repeatedly said Man alive don t kill me man alive don t beat me —he said he would murder her outright but he would murder her by inches so that the law should not touch him—he said For I can cheat the Devil and I am d—d if I do not think I can cheat the Government over you —after she went into the bedroom he told me he thought he had hurt her head very much indeed and he wished I would get some warm water and bathe it for her and look at it—I went into the bedroom looked at her head and found it in a most dreadful state—her ear was the colour of a piece of sheep s liver—I did not notice which ear it was—she had a cut on her head some distance above the same ear—the parts all about the ear were swollen—I did not put my hand to her ear—I found there was clotted blood on her hair—I went and fetched some warm water—I told her I could not bathe her head it was in such a dreadful state I could not attempt to look at it again I was very sorry but she must bathe it herself—I then came away into the parlour—the prisoner was still sitting smoking his pipe—he asked me about her and I said she was dreadful bad and he had better let her go to bed for her ear was beyond all description—he said he could not spare her from the shop then that it was Saturday—he did not go into the bedroom but remained where he was—about ten minutes after as near as I can tell she came into the parlour—I told her I must go away and she begged of me to remain—the prisoner went away I cannot say where but I think into the bakehouse—I remained a few minutes after that and then left—it was about three then—I returned between five and six and saw the prisoner go in before me—I found his wife in the shop—she appeared very stupid indeed as if she had been drinking a good deal—she came into the parlour—the prisoner came into the parlour a little while after and asked her if she had sent the twopenny loaf to one of the customers as he had ordered—I forget the name—she said she had not—he then asked if she had sent to another customer Mr Robinson—she said No that the bread had not come up from the bakehouse—she said she would send it then—he then replied that it was a d—d shame it was no use to send it then the bread was cold and it was past their teatime and he boxed her ears repeatedly and told her to go and put the bread in the window—I cannot say how often he struck her I should say about a dozen violent blows—I cannot say whether his hand touched that part of her head I had just before examined or whether it was the same side or not—I cannot say whether all the blows were on one side or not—she attempted to put five or six loaves in the window and then fell down—I went to her and noticed blood coming from a cut near her eye—I said Good Gods uncle she is in a fit —she looked up and said I am in a fit Mary Ann and a very bad one too don t leave Mary Ann for God s sake don t leave me —I asked him to come and help me pick her up—he said he would not come and pick her up—he made use of some bad language I do not know what it was and said she was drunk and she might lay there—I was so faint that I was forced to leave her there and go outside the parlour-door—I do not know how she got up—I was not away five minutes and when I went back she was in her bedroom standing at the side of a sink with her head resting on her hand and sliding herself down—she slid down on the floor and rested her head on a step at the door from the bedroom into the kitchen—she was then quite insensible—the prisoner I think was still in the shop—she laid there two hours or it might be more—I asked the prisoner to come and help me pick her up and put her on the bed—he said no she should never lay on a bed of his again—I got him to go in once or twice and he looked at her and kicked her two or three times severely and said You drunken b—h get up —my husband came at a few minutes or a quarter-past eight and got some warm water and washed her face—he did not lift her up first her face was so covered with blood—he could get at her face as she lay there on his knees—she never came to—my husband aferwards put her on the children s bed—very shortly after that I asked the prisoner to send for a doctor—he said there was no occasion for a doctor—I and my husband remained there till between twelve and one in the morning and no doctor was sent for while we were there—she continued in the same insensible state—I spoke to the prisoner two or three times about a doctor and within half an hour of my leaving—he then said there was no occasion for a doctor then he should see how she got on if she did not get any better he would send for one—he asked me to come early in the morning—I cannot say what time it was when I got there—I should think it was not long after six when the little boy came to me—the prisoner sent the eldest boy for me soon after six and I was there some time before eight—I found her just in the same state as I had left her—I asked the prisoner if he had sent for a doctor—he said No —I said You had better send for one directly —he said he did not know what to do or who he should send for and I advised him to send for a gentleman who had been attending her Mr Pritchard—he said I do not know where he lives now —eventually a Mr Watkins was sent for and he came while I was there and saw her—I remained there till past twelve that Saturday night—she was quite senseless all that time—Mr Watkins saw her repeatedly in the course of the day—I went again about eleven next day and found she was dead Cross-examined Q To whom did the piano belong A To Mr and Mrs Moir they let lodgings—I am not aware that they had people there connected with the theatre—I was examined before the Coroner and Magistrate—I remember perfectly well the prisoner on that Saturday saying repeatedly I will not murder you outright but I will do so by inches so that the law shall not touch me for I can cheat the devil and the Government over you—I never mentioned that publicly in the presence of the prisoner till now—I mentioned it to my family after I thought of it after I had been to Bow-street but I never told any one of it till I told the sergeant of it yesterday—I believe I mentioned yesterday about his saying he would get the rolling-pin and force the meat down her throat—I am not aware that I ever said it till yesterday COURT Q Were you before the Grand Jury A Yes I told them about murdering her by inches but not in presence of the prisoner—I do not know whether I mentioned about the pieces of bread till I did it to the Grand Jury MR BODKIN Q Whom of your family did you mention it to A My sisters I believe I told them of it the day she died—when I was examined before the Magistrate I was very unwell indeed—I was examined on the Thursday and I had not been in bed from the Sunday night—I was minding the prisoner s shop and I was hardly able to give any evidence at all at the time—when that was said about murdering by inches no one was present but the prisoner his wife and me and the eldest child—lam not aware whether the youngest child was there or not AMELIA MENDEZ I am the wife of David Mendez In March I lodged at the prisoner s house in Brydges-street and occupied the front room first floor—I recollect coming down-stairs on Saturday 23rd March between three and four o clock—as I came near the parlour occupied by the prisoner I heard Mrs Moir screaming and crying dreadfully—I heard her say several times Oh you will kill me you will kill me —I knew the prisoner s voice—I heard him say I will murder you before I have done with you —one of the children was in the room but I cannot say which and I heard the child call out Oh father don t kill my mother you will kill my mother —I did not hear any other voice in the room I did not hear any other sounds—I stopped at the door to listen ALEXANDER GEORGE MOIR I am thirteen years old and am the prisoner s son I remember the Saturday before my mother died—I was in the parlour at dinner-time and my father threw the bread at her twice—he said he could murder her at once but he would not murder her direct because of the law of the country but he would do it by inches—he said he could cheat the devil and he thought he could cheat the Government—I cannot remember whether anybody had said anything to him—about half an hour after that I went away with some bread—Mrs Bryant was there all the while Cross-examined Q Have you ever given evidence before A Yet once before the Magistrate—I did not tell the Magistrate this—the Magistrate asked me questions and I answered him—I was sworn— no deposition of this witness was returned Q Who put you in mind of this about murdering her what made you think of it A I have heard father mention it once or twice before when my grandmother was alive which will be twelve months on the 23rd of this month—Mrs Bryant is my cousin—I and Mrs Bryant have not talked this thing over—we have talked about it and said it was a bad thing—I have not repeated this conversation to her that I have told to-day and she has not repeated it to me—no one at all repeated it to me—I told it to some gentleman yesterday—Mrs Bryant was present then—she said it to the same gentleman too—I said it after her COURT Q What sort of health had your mother been in A She had been sickly all along and she never was in good health MR BODKIN Q Is this the gentleman you spoke of the solicitor A Yes I saw him yesterday—I had not seen him before that I am aware of—I was with Mrs Bryant when he asked me the questions—we went together—she was in the room when he asked me first of all—she told it first in my hearing—that was before I had been examined by that gentleman JOSHUA WATKINS I am a surgeon and reside at Chandos-street Charing-cross On Sunday morning 24th March about eight o clock I was called to see the prisoner s wife—I found her on a bed—I examined her—her head neck and face were covered with contusions—the face was amazingly swollen and the features very much distorted—she was perfectly insensible—the entire scalp was contused—it appeared to be a very dangerous case—I apprehended fatal results from the first—I visited her on the Sunday evening two or three hours and she continued completely insensible till the Monday when she died—I made a post mortem examination—she died of compression of the brain in my judgment caused by extravasated blood under the dura mater—the contused condition of the head face and neck might produce rupture of the internal vessels and extravasation—repeated blows from the open hand on the head would most decidedly cause the appearances I observed on the head—the brain was remarkably healthy I have seldom seen so healthy a brain—the liver was a little paler than usual but plump and elastic and so were all the abdominal viscera—the paleness of the liver was probably produced when death took place—the whole of the back was contused from the head to the lowest part—those bruises did not conduce to the death—I attribute it entirely to the bruises on the head—the head was in a perfectly pulpy state there was extravasation of all the fluids under the integuments of the head—on examining the viscera I discovered not the slightest alcoholic smell—the viscera did not present any appearance of a person given to drinking and that I might be perfectly certain of that I inserted my head into the body so that had there been any effluvia from any alcoholic liquid of any kind I must have detected it and another thing the liver of a drunkard is of so remarkable a character that it is impossible to mistake it—it was certainly not the liver of a confirmed drunkard—I made the examination on the Tuesday morning—there was not the least smell of liquor in the interior GUILTY of Manslaughter under very aggravated circumstances Aged 46 — Transported for Life Before Mr Justice

t18510203-503  503 THOMAS JOHNSON for the wilful murder of Sarah Johnson —He was also charged on the Coroner s Inquisition with manslaughter MESSRS BODKIN and CLERK conducted the Prosecution EDWARD CONSTABLE policeman N 430 On Sunday morning 11th Jan about five o clock in the morning I was on duty in Macclesfield-street St Luke s and saw the prisoner—he addressed me first and said My wife has died —I asked him the reason—he said he did not know he was up-stairs and heard a noise came down and found her lying on the floor that he spoke to her and she made no reply and he came out to look for a policeman—he said Come with me and I went with him to 24 Graham-street about 200 yards from where I met him—going along I asked him the cause of her death—he said he did not do it—there was no light I got one from a neighbour went into the back-parlour and saw a woman lying about the centre of the floor with her head in a pool of blood—the room was in great confusion everything was strewed about the floor—I lifted up the arm it was cold—I asked the prisoner to come with me to fetch a doctor—we went to Dr Hutchinson who returned with us and sergeant Baker who is not here—we got a light and examined more particularly—the deceased was in the same position—she was dressed all but one shoe and stocking—the doctor said to the prisoner How do you account for this —he said I did not murder her I did not do it I did not do it —I took him into custody—I saw a hammer and a shoemaker s awl on the floor that was all I noticed—I did not search—I examined the prisoner s hands—there was a great deal of dry blood on them—that was about half an hour after he first came to me—he said he was no thief or murderer—he was sober when he first came to me and was dressed excepting his hat—he had his boots on Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did he open the door for you to go in A Yes he walked by my side to the doctor s—I could not distinguish that be had been drinking—I had seen him five or six years ago—he was no acquaintance of mine JOHN HUTCHINSON I am a surgeon of Islington I was called to the house by Constable about half-past five o clock in the morning—I knew the deceased I had been attending her professionally for asthma and difficulty of breathing—her name was Sarah Johnson—she was about sixty-three years old—I had seen her about two o clock on the day before—she was in feeble health she suffered principally from debility and cough—I found her dead body in the back-parlour on the ground-floor—that was where the prisoner worked at his trade of a shoemaker—I believe they had a sleeping-room over it—I examined the body it was warm but the legs arms and face were cold—I should think she had been dead at least two or three hours I cannot say exactly—the face was very much swollen and contused the eyelids swollen and blackened the whole of the scalp was very much swollen and the hair which was long was matted with blood so as to prevent my making a minute search—there was a lacerated wound on the angle of the right side of the mouth—the skin was rubbed off the left elbow and both knees—the body laid on the right side with the legs drawn up—the whole of her face was smeared with blood and there were splashes of blood on her hands—her left shoe and stocking were off—with that exception she was perfectly dressed as for the day—her cap was off and lying under her head it was a day-cap—there was a smell of liquor but whether it arose from the body or had been spilt on the ground I do not know—there was a stocking near the fire-place with a needle in it as if she had been at work and a cloak near the head saturated with blood as if it had been used to wipe blood up with—I asked the prisoner how it happened—he said she had had a fit that he heard a noise as if she was falling about—I told him it was a very suspicious case—he said he was sure he did not do it—I think he said at that time that he had lived with his wife for forty-one years—I had been attending her about ten or twelve days—I had not known her before that—she had not complained to me of liability to fits nor had I observed any tendency to it—I made a post mortem examination of the body next evening and found a wound on the left side of the head two or three inches above the ear—it wounded a branch of the temporal artery—there was great extravasation of blood between the scalp and the skull—there were two ounces of blood under the dura mater pressing on the brain—that was underneath the wound which had penetrated completely through the scalp to the bone and stopped there—the extravasation of blood and the internal congestion were not caused by that wound—the blood effused on the brain came from a rupture of the middle menengeal artery which was caused by external violence blows falls or kicks and not I should say by the violence attending that wound—I attribute the death to compression of the brain occasioned by the congestion of blood on it—independently of that I do not think the wound itself would be likely to hare caused death it might have done so in her weak state from the hemorrhage—there was a great deal of blood about her quite a pool—I examined the other organs but found nothing to throw a light upon this inquiry—I found this knife produced under the table about a yard and a half from the body covered with human hair of a greyish colour very much more than is on it now and some on the handle—I compared it with the wound it corresponded with it exactly—I think it is a shoemaker s knife Cross-examined Q You do not mean to say that all the blood found there could have come from the wound on the head A Not the whole of it there might have been a good deal from the wound by the mouth—she had not complained to me of falls—I bad only seen her about five times not every day ANN ELIZABETH MARY BUTTS I reside in the same house as the prisoner and his wife did—there are four rooms in it and a wing which is two rooms added but they are occupied—I have only one room that is on the ground-floor—the prisoner s parlour was on that floor separated from my room by a partition—their bedroom was on the floor above—the prisoner is a shoemaker and worked in the parlour adjoining mine—there are other lodgers On the Saturday night before Mrs Johnson s death between eleven and twelve o clock I was in my parlour and heard the prisoner speaking very angrily in his parlour apparently to his wife—I heard no other voice—I heard him say I will do for you you b——y b——r —I heard no answer made to that—I heard a noise in their room as of things being thrown about—that continued about half an hour—I could distinguish the prisoner s voice and his words repeatedly saying the same—I thought from his voice that he was dreadfully intoxicated—I had not seen him that evening—I have seen him drunk before—the things seemed to break as they fell—I heard something heavy fall and then all was silent—the room became quiet a little after twelve—I can distinctly hear persons moving from one room to another and going upstairs—I heard no person go up-stairs from the lower to the upper room after the disturbance ceased—I went to bed about a quarter-past twelve—I did not remain awake very long but I awake at the least noise and should have heard any person coming up-stairs—between six and seven or it might be before I heard somebody in the next room on the ground-floor—I was disturbed by the police Cross-examined Q Was the prisoner generally very much excited when he was drunk A Very his wife was in the habit of drinking—they always quarrelled when they were both drunk—they always seemed to behave well to each other when sober—I heard his voice before I heard things being thrown about—I heard him say What are you here for you b—r like a drunken man and after that I heard the things thrown about—after I heard the fall I went to the back-door—I had not nerve enough to go into the room—I have lived in the house three or four months COURT Q Does any one live with you A No I am a widow I was alone when I heard the noise and went and informed Charlotte Bennett and Mary Ann Richards who lived in the house—they were on the ground-floor—they could not hear so distinctly as I could their room is farther off than mine—I had not seen the deceased since the Friday—I spoke to her then—she looked very ill CHARLOTTE BENNETT I live with my husband in the same house with the prisoner and his wife adjoining their bedroom up-stairs On this Saturday night between eleven and twelve o clock I was sitting downstairs in the front parlour—Mrs Butt s room is between that room and the prisoner s—Mrs Butt said something to me and she and I went to the back-door to listen—I heard the prisoner say You b—r I will do for you —he used very bad expressions and said You have got coal-heavers in the place —I heard somebody say in a very faint voice Do you call yourself a man —it seemed like Mrs Johnson s voice and proceeded from their room as also did what he said—I heard things being thrown about in the room—there was such a dreadful noise going on I could hardly hear what was said—I then heard a very heavy fall on the floor—I heard no noise after that—before I went out I heard Mrs Johnson call it was not crying or moaning she had a constant cough and was asthmatic—we heard nothing more and went in-doors—we had been listening about half an hour—I took no more notice but went to bed about half-past two—if the prisoner had gone up-stairs after that I must have heard him—I heard nothing—he might have gone up while I was in the room below without my hearing him—I heard nothing more till morning Cross-examined Q Did not the prisoner seem to you to be silly over it and to be mad drunk A Yes he did not seem to know what he was doing—I have lived in the house eight months—the deceased had no fall that I am aware of—I never saw her drunk in my life—I go out to work every day—Mrs Butt stops at home she keeps a school MR BODKIN Q Had you seen her that evening A No not since Friday evening—I think the prisoner was intoxicated—I never saw any coal-heavers in the place COURT Q Are you married A Yes my husband is away all the week—he was not with me—Mary Ann Richer was—when we heard the fall we went away instantly—nothing was said or done after that as far at I heard—we left nobody there—we all three went away at the same time—Mary Ann Richer is married her husband was not there—there were no other grown persons in the house—the fall did not frighten us MARY ANN RICHER I am fifteen years old and live with my father and mother in this house On this night I was sitting with Mrs Butt and went to listen between eleven and twelve o clock—I heard the prisoner in his room using bad language to his wife—I know she was in the room because I heard her hard breathing from asthma—I heard the prisoner swearing at her and abusing her but did not hear him say he would do for her—I heard him throwing things about they appeared to be his tools—I staid there about a quarter of an hour this was going on all the time—after that I heard a heavy fall but no cry or noise as if any one was hurt—we all went away then—I sat up till about half-past two—I heard no one go up-stairs—I sleep up-stairs—there is a room between mine and that where the prisoner sleeps—I had not seen him that day or the deceased—my mother was out ELIZABETH CRAWLET I am married and live in City-gardens opposite to the door of the prisoner s house I last saw the deceased on 11th Jan —after ten o clock she came into the Prince of Wales public-house while I was there with a yellow jug—I did not notice what she bad got—she left five or ten minutes afterwards—she passed close to me and smiled—she did not speak—I saw no reason to believe she was in liquor—I did not see the prisoner that day EDWARD BAKER policeman N 9 On this Sunday morning about & quarter to six o clock I went up-stairs at this house to a bedroom—there was a bed on the floor—there was but one sheet it was slightly disarranged—there was an old counterpane on the top which was thrown on one side towards the foot of the bed in one corner that was the only covering on the bed—I went down into the sitting-room and found this knife produced —there was a yellow jug there with the remains of maltliquor in it and splashes of blood on the outside of it—there were splashes of blood on the legs of the chairs—I turned my light on to the prisoner s bands and forehead there were splashes of blood on them—I said How came that blood on your hands and forehead he said he most have got it when be was feeling for his wife in the dark—I took off his boots and asked him how the blood came on them—he made the same reply—these are them produced Cross-examined Q You told him yon took him on suspicion of canting the death of his wife A Yes he said Yes certainly and shed a few tears—he said I have had her forty-one years I am sore I did not kill her —I took him to the station COURT Q Did he say how it happened A When I asked him how she came in that state he said I do not know I was in bed I heard a great noise down-stairs as if the things were falling about I got up dressed myself and went down-stairs I called my wife by her name she did not answer I felt about for her in the dark and found her on the floor I thought she was dead and I ran out for a policeman —I said How long was that before you saw the policeman —he said About half an hour —I asked him if he undressed when be went to bed—he said Yes I did —I asked him where his wife was when he went to bed—he said I left her here we were then in the lower room —I said Do you usually leave your wife here when you go to bed —he said Yes she generally stays up after me to see that all is right —I asked him if he was out before he went to bed—he said I was at the public-house till eleven o clock —I asked him if he staid with his wife any time after

Prosecution WILLIAM RICE I am a cab-driver and reside at 2 Garden-place Bell-street street Westminster the same house where the deceased Richard Judd resided—he rented it and was my landlord—I had only lived in the house a fortnight when this occurrence took place—I knew the prisoner by sight he was Richard Judd s son and lived with him—there are two rooms in the house I occupied the lower part and Judd and the prisoner the upper—on Saturday morning 12th April between eight and nine while I was in my room I heard a scuffling up-stairs for about a minute or two and I heard a sort of moan after it was over—the prisoner then came down-stairs and went into the yard went up-stairs again came down again immediately and went out—the deceased then came out locked the door and came down and as he came down I heard him make the same sort of moan—the right side of his face was covered with blood—he went out at the srarden-gate—I believe he had four other sons besides the prisoner—one of them afterwards came and the deceased s brother s wife and broke the door open—I went up and the bed was all over blood and the room also in different parts—I saw a small shovel-handle in the room about an inch and a half long it had blood on it produced this is it—it has been broken—this poker produced was also in the room—I did not observe any blood upon that Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You mean there was a piece broken off of about an inch or two A The shovel was broken off and there was about half the length of my finger left and there was blood on it—I did not speak to the deceased as he came down-stairs—my wife went out after him—I was not dressed at the time—I found blood in every part of the room—it seemed as if there had been a considerable struggle and I had heard what appeared to be a great struggle between the two the deceased Was quite dressed when he went out SARAH RICE I am the last witness s wife I saw the deceased at the gate—Ilia face and head were covered with blood—he had a hat on—I went out after him into the street and there was a person of the name of Larkin with him—I asked him where he was going and he said to his son s—I went and got another son to come and see the father and the brother ANN LARKIN I live in Garden-place Westminster On the Saturday morning I saw the deceased come out of his gate and I went and assisted him along the street to Mr Painter s the doctor s—he was not at home and I went with deceased to the Westminster Hospital—he walked there WILLIAM THOMAS PALMER policeman B 104 I was called to the Westminster Hospital and saw Judd who afterwards died there—I went to the room at 2 Garden-place and saw one of the deceased a sons there—I produce a nightcap and a tooth which I found—the nightcap hat blood on it and smut as if from a poker—the deceased had lost a tooth MARK LOOME policeman B 11 I went in search of the prisoner on 12th April and on the morning of 14th he came of his own accord to the station—he was charged with assaulting and wounding his father who was then alive—he said his father had brought it all on himself—when he was before Mr Broderip the Magistrate the same day after being cautioned he made a statement—it is stated in my second examination—it was taken down in a book by the clerk at the first examination— MR BODKIN proposed to prove by the witness what the prisoner stated on that occasion MR BALLANTINE objected as it was not returned in the depositions and could only be proved by calling the clerk who took it down The COURT allowed the objection —I found this poker near the fire-place and these clothes on the bed they are covered with blood and this pillow-case and handkerchief The prisoner s statement before the Magistrate was here read— All I have to say is that it was done accidentally LEONARD GEORGE BOOR I was house-surgeon at Westminster Hospital when Judd was brought in—he was placed under my care—he was then sensible and able to undress himself—when in bed I examined him and found on the right side of his head two inches above the ear a contused wound about four and a half inches long the skull was fractured underneath the bone slightly depressed there was a similar wound about an inch and a quarter long just below it behind the same far—there was a wound extending from the right cheek bone under the right cheek bone towards the eye at the inner angle of the eye to the bridge of the nose and the bones of the nose on the left side were broken—there was a small flesh-wound on the cheek over the canine tooth of the upper jaw which penetrated into the mouth the gum was lacerated and the tooth gone—I examined the tooth that was found and it was of the same sort that might have come from there—there were marks of a blow over the lower jaw which was broken and there were marks of a wound on the knuckle of the right-hand little finger—I think there could not have been less than three blows to produce the injuries I saw there might have been four—they were such as might have been produced by a Heavy instrument such as a poker—he was sixty-two years old—he continued under my care a fortnight at the end of which time he died from the effects of the injuries COURT Q Which do you say was the fatal blow A The fracture of the skull—he answered questions when he first came as to his name and age—after his death I examined the body—I have no doubt his death was caused by the fracture and the consequences of the blows altogether on the system Cross-examined Q He was quite capable for the first three days of answering any questions you put to him A Yes and in a state to give an account of how the matter happened—I asked him how it was done—he said he did not know he was in bed at the time but did not know—I repeated the question afterwards and he evaded it—he seemed to have a great indisposition to answer questions of any kind Henry Hand shoemaker of 1 Bell-strtet Vincent-square and Henry Mould

like offence MESSRS RYLAND and CLERK conducted the Prosecution EDWARD NEWTON policeman L 219 On the morning of 5th May I was on duty with the deceased Henry James Chaplen at Vauxhall-walk—about 1 o clock we heard a disturbance close to the corner of Salamanca-street at the lower end of Vauxhall-walk near the Pheasant—we went there and saw nine or ten men—the three prisoners were among them—they were hallooing and making a very great noise—Chaplen said to them If you don t go home quietly I will lock one or two of you up —upon that they hallooed louder—I then spoke to Hickey and M Elligott and said Go home there s good men and don t make such a noise at this time in the morning —Hickey replied By Jesus we know what the time is we have it in our pocket —I crossed over the road to speak to some men and a woman who were hallooing—four or five of them seemed to go on faster than the others towards the Queen s Head—I was not near enough to see who they were—I followed them and when I got opposite Salamanca-street they all appeared to rush out at once from the opposite side of the street—Chaplen was then on the pavement directly opposite the gate—I saw Hickey strike Chaplen on the side of the face with what appeared to me like a brickbat—Chaplen staggered against the window shutters drew his staff and struck at Hickey—I rushed across the road and saw Cane strike Chaplen on the leftside of the head about the temple be fell down and as he was falling a person who I could not recognise gave him another blow on the left side of the head—there were four or five other persons round him at the time these blows were struck—I could not see whether Chaplen s head was bleeding at that time—the spot where the blow was struck was directly opposite Salamanca-street—as Chaplen was falling I rushed at Cane caught hold of the collar of his jacket and struck him with my staff over the temple—at the same time I received a blow from a stone on my left shoulder which knocked me down—I still had hold of Cane—I got up again and received a blow in my breast and went down again—I got up again and ran up Salamanea-street springing my rattle I heard the prisoners run away when I sprung my rattle Chaplen was then lying on the pavement—two constables came up and I assisted them in taking Chaplen to the Queen s Head—afterwards in consequence of information I and another constable went to 49 Vauxhall-walk that might have been about ten minutes or a quarter-of-an-hour after Chaplen had been knocked down —it is only three doors from the Pheasant—I knocked at the door some time and it was opened—I went in and saw Hickey coming out of the kitchen or wash-house door—he was bleeding from the right-side of the head—he had his clothes on—we took him into custody—my brother constable said to him I take you into custody for assaulting or ill-treating one of the constables —he said he had not been out or would not go out of the house I do not know which—a constable named Streems said to him How came the blood on your hands —he said My nose has been bleeding —we took him outside—he said at first that he would go and then he began to kick and plunge about—when we got him into the street I saw M Elligott close outside the garden railings of No 49—I turned my lamp on him and said Holloa young fellow and said to my brother constable Here is one of them and he was taken into custody by No 113—I left Hickey in charge of two constables who took him to the station and came back to No 49—I then saw Cane coming up from the cellar—he was dressed—he tried to get out at the backdoor—his head was bleeding at the side—Streems went and stopped him and said Surrender or I will strike you down —he said Oh he would go—Streems told him he took him for assaulting a constable he said Oh he would go—he attempted to getaway but was taken to the station after a good deal of resistance—Chaplen was taken to his own house on the morning of 5th May—he was insensible all the time a surgeon was brought to see him—when Chaplen struck at Hickey the blow took effect on his head—when Hickey and Cane first came up neither of them were bleeding—I did not see Cane there at first I first saw him when I attempted to take him into custody—I had never seen him before—I mean that I first saw him directly opposite Salamanca-street when he struck Chaplen—Cane s head was not bleeding at that time—Hickey and M Elligott were together they were the first two that I spoke to—Hickey s head was not bleeding when I first saw him Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q How long have you been a police-constable A Ten or eleven weeks—I am a tailor by trade—I had never been in any row of this kind before—Chaplen s beat joined mine—this took place on Streems s beat—Streems was not there till the disturbance was over—I came down Salamanca-street—I had no opportunity of seeing what was going on till I got to the corner of the street—I had seen Chaplen before that evening about 20 minutes or a quarter after 12 o clock—this was about 20 minutes past I—when I got to the bottom of Salamanca-street I saw Chaplen walking up the road—I spoke to him a few minutes before he was knocked down and then went on my beat—the persons were hallooing bawling singing and arousing themselves—I had never been in the house 49 before—I have since ascertained that between fourteen and sixteen persons lodge there principally men who work at the gas-works—I have not been on duty there since—I had not my staff out before the stones were used—I drew my staff directly I saw Chaplen s staff out and I seized Cane and struck him over the head—i was knocked down immediately after I struck Cane—that did not make me leave go my hold we both fell together—Cane got away from me after I got up—I was not knocked down more than once—after Cane got away from me I lost sight of him I ran up Salamanca-street—brickbats were being thrown about while I was falling—it was all done instantly—there were ten or eleven persons taken into custody about this—I did not know any of them before—I know what has become of some of them since—I do not know that some of them have gone away Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You had not known any of these persons before A No Hickey is the middle prisoner—I did not notice whether he had much of a wound when he was taken into custody his head was bleeding—he was dressed as he is now he had a different neek-handkerchief a silk one with stripes I noticed that when I first spoke to him—we have it in our possession he took it off at the station—I noticed the colour of the stripes when I first spoke to him—I do not know how to describe the colour exactly but the stripes were a little darker colour than the rest I noticed it because it was tied like a sailor s—he had this sort of coat on not a corduroy-jacket and a cap—I might be a foot from him when I spoke to him first I was almost touching him there was M Elligott between us—I saw his face—there was a gas-lamp three or four yards off that enabled me to see his face—it would have been too dark without that for me to have seen him—the gas-lamp was in front of him—that was the first time I saw his face—Hickey was close to Chaplen when I saw him strike a blow—they were nearly opposite me—there was two yards and a half or three yards between us—he struck Chaplen about the side of the face—I saw something dark in his hand it looked to me like a brickbat—when Chaplen struck at Hickey I heard the sound of the staff and saw it go close to his head—there were two or three persons between us which prevented ray seeing whether the blow reached him—I saw three blows given to Chaplen—I do not know whether there was a man named Clarey amongst the people—I do not know a person of that name—I have not to my knowledge been looking after a person of that name—a man named Burke was taken into custody that night—I do not know whether Thomas and William Burke were taken—I was called on to identify them and was unable to do so—I attended all the examinations before the Magistrates—a person named Harrington was charged and discharged by the Magistrate after being had up a second time—Ellen Dunn was examined as a witness for the prisoners—I believe Mr Carter the inspector brought her forward—she was examined at his suggestion—I heard her give her evidence—he brought forward Mrs Cole likewise—I do not recollect his bringing forward Mrs Donahay—Mrs Cole is the landlady of the house and Ellen Dunn is the servant Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q Were the men very drunk A They were in liquor—M Elligott was not very drunk—I did not say before the Grand Jury that the men were very much intoxicated particularly M Elligott—I never saw him before MR CLERK Q On which examination were Dunn and Mrs Cole called as witnesses A I think it was on the second examination—we were three times before the Magistrate I think—at the time I struck Cane on the head Chaplen was falling on the ground he had then been struck by Cane with a brickbat which he held in his hand—no brickbats had been thrown before Chaplen was struck to the ground WILLIAM LONEY policeman L 201 Between 1 and 2 o clock on 5th May I was on duty in Glasshouse-street Vauxhall-walk that is about half-way between the White Lion and the Pheasant—I beard a rattle springing at the top of Vauxhall-walk—I went there and when I got to 49 very near the Pheasant I met the three prisoners and another man not in custody—Cane and Hickey went into 49 and the others ran on—they were all running when I first saw them I stopped and looked at the men as they passed me—I did not stop them but went on towards the spot where I found Chaplen—he was lying on the ground bleeding and unconscious—I assisted in lifting him up and taking him into the Queen s Head—I afterwards went with Newton and Streems to the house 49 where I had seen Cane and Hickey go in I there found Hickey in the yard by the kitchen-door I observed blood on his face and hand—Streams asked him how the blood came on his hand—he said his nose had been bleeding—the blood on his face was on his forehead and was trickling down his cheek—we took him into custody—he came quietly through the house but resisted when he got to the door—he was secured and taken to the station—I went there with him—he took a handkerchief from his neck and gave it me—I told him he had better wear it—he said be should not want it I kept it—it was bloody—this produced is it—he was drunk but could walk and talk and understand Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q You speak of four men you met and three you speak to positively what makes you speak so positively to the three A I have seen them before at the White Lion—I did not know them by name—I had a look at them as they ran past me—Hickey had a cap on and the others hats—I will swear I had seen Cane before more than once when I have been on duty of an evening—I had seen him two nights previously—I did not know where he lived—there was nothing particular about his face which excited my attention—his hat was over his forehead as every man would wear a hat—there was nothing to hinder me from seeing his features—I did not speak to him he was across the road standing still—when I saw the four they were running and ran past me—I saw them ten yards before they came to me they were running all the time I could see them well—my beat joins Newton s—Chaplen s beat was opposite mine he went higher up part of the Vauxhall-walk was in his beat from the White Lion to the Pheasant—I believe that was the beat he had that night it was from just before you get to the gas-works to the Pheasant and round a street I do not know the name of but it was the opposite beat to me that night—I had one side of Vauxhall-walk and be bad the other—I saw him a quarter of an hour before seeing him on the ground he was opposite to me and I asked him how he was—he had then to turn down Jonathan-street and come back again into the Walk near the White Lion—I came down to the Pheasant we were both near the Pheasant Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q When Hickey was taken in Cole s house how many constables went in A Streems Newton Curtis and myself there were four or five I will not be sure—Curtis is not here—I did not hear Hickey say that Curtis had struck him in the house—he gave me the handkerchief from his neck be did not account for the blood on it by saying that one of the constables had struck him in the house he said nothing about being struck in the house that I heard—I had not got my staff out and I did not see that Curtis had—I can t say whether the other constables had theirs out—I and Curtis came over the back-yard and I did not see that Curtis had his staff out then—we were stopped by seeing Hickey at the wash-house door—I did not see Curtis strike at him—Curtis is on night duty he is doing nothing at this moment he was not before the Magistrate Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q Will you swear you have seen M Elligott before A Yes two months before at the Cock public-house—I had been on that beat three months it was my first beat—I have only been three months in the force—I came in at the same time as Newton—M Elligott was drunk but not very drunk he knew what be was about or he would not have run away they were all tipsy MR RYLAND Q Did Curtis and you go to the house No 49 together A Yes I stayed in the house as long as he did but did not see him strike Hickey—I saw no truncheon while we were in the house—I will not be positive of that THOMAS STREEMS policeman On 5th May I was on duty in Broad-street Lambeth and heard a rattle springing about 20 minutes past 1 o clock—I went to Vauxhall-walk where the sound appeared to come from and saw the deceased Henry James Chaplen lying on the footway—I assisted in taking him to the Queen s Head and Newton called a surgeon—I went with Newton Loney and Curtis to No 49—I knocked the door was fastened—we got in by breaking open a side-door leading to the back-front—I saw Hickey standing at the wash-house door I saw some blood about his face— Curtis came in behind me he was then getting over the railing —I asked him what blood that was on his hands—he put his hands behind him and said he had no blood on them—I took hold of his hand and showed him that there was blood on it—he then said his nose had been bleeding—other constables took him to the station—I then saw Cane come up out of a cellar or coalhole the kitchen is on the ground-floor —he had a cut I believe it was over the right eye—he asked me what I wanted of him—I said On a charge of assaulting a police-constable —he said he knew nothing of it—he was taken to the station—I assisted in taking Chaplen to the hospital—when Hickey was taken he was dressed as he is now excepting his handkerchief be wore a hat ROBERT SHARP I keep the White Lion High-streeet Vauxhall I know Cane and Hickey—they were there on 4th May about half-past 9 o clock as near as I can recollect—they remained till half-past 12 or a quarter to 1—they were the last in the house—I saw them when they left—they were quite sober and comfortable Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Was Harrington among the people who left A I cannot say—I now recollect myself the two Shanahans and Harrington were there—Hickey was dressed when he left my house in a corded jacket and trowsers and a hat—Clarey was in my house that night—I had known him three months—he left rather before Hickey—he had on a black frock-coat and a cap—I have never seen him since—I had been in the habit of seeing him nearly every day before that—he works at the gas works—I have known Hickey about six months—he had frequented my home the whole of the time—scarcely a day passed when he was not there—he is a remarkably quiet well-disposed man and bears a very good character—I never knew him use an angry word Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Do you know Cane also A I have known him about the same time—he is a very quiet man—he has been working all the time in the gas-factory—all those who were discharged have kept in the neighbourhood but Clarey I have not seen—there had been a meeting at my house to make a collection for Clarey which is the custom among the Irish if a man has been a long time out of work they give him what they can—I understood Clarey had been out of work—there were fifty or sixty persons present—they all went away within a quarter of an hour—I know Mrs Connell—she and her husband were there that evening—they all went away within a few minutes of each other MR RYLAND Q Was the collection to find Clarey some work A It was to get him some clothes—I understand he borrowed a coat to go there in—there were from ten to twenty women there—I do not recollect the dresses of the forty men but this man being the last in the house was the cause of my noticing him—about half-past 12 o clock I told them it was time to go and in less than a quarter of an hour they were all gone Hickey had asked me for more drink and I refused to serve him—I told him it was time to be gone—his being there last gave me an opportunity of observing his dress and I had seen him during the day—neither Cane nor Hickey had any blood about them when they left—the collection is made by a person sitting with a plate and the money is collected in the same way as at a Church-door MICHAEL CONNOR I am a labourer and live at 49 Vauxhall-walk On Sunday night 4th May I was in the White Lion and saw the prisoners—I left them there about a quarter-past 12 o clock—there were then about twenty or twenty-five persons there—I am not sure how Hickey was dressed Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you talk to Hickey A I spoke to him—he generally wears a black jacket like these trowsers showing his own trousers which were brown corduroy Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q Did you know M Elligott before A Yes MR RTLAND Q What colour are your trowsers A Black he had got on a jacket the colour of my trowsers WILLIAM NICHOLAS policeman L 113 I took M Elligott about half-past 1 or 20 minutes to 2 o clock in the morning standing opposite the door of 40 Vauxhallwalk—he was handed over to me by Newton—he asked me what I took him for—I said the inspector on duty would tell him when he rot to the station or the Magistrate would tell him next day—he said he knew nothing about the murder—I had not mentioned the word Murder —it was not about the matter Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q Cane and Hickey had been in custody about an hour previously had they not A No CHARLES BURGESS GOUGH police-inspector L On 5th May about 9 in the morning I went to 101 Vauxhall-walk There is a garden in front of the house with pieces of stone round the flower-bed called potters clinkers or binders—there was a deficiency in them in the front of apparently ten or twelve—inspector Carter pointed out to me the place where Chaplen fell—that is about fifty-three yards from the garden—here is one of the clinkers from the garden produced —I received these eight other clinkers from Streems—on 5th May I took them to the garden and fitted them to the gap—several fitted completely but in a number of places the mould had fallen in but when I fitted them they filled up the whole space—the spot pointed out to me was directly facing No 1 Salamanca-street THOMAS STREEMS re-examined I found these clinkers opposite Salamanca-street where Chaplen had laid about an hour and a half after he was removed MR PARNELL Q Scattered about in different directions A Five of them were close to the spot where the body lay and the others in different directions—one or two were as much as ten yards from the spot and the others less MARY HANDS I am the wife of William Hands a policeman of 101 Vauxhall-walk We have a flower-bed in the front garden with stones similar to these round it of various sorts and sizes—they were all in their places at half-past 10 o clock at night on 4th May when I let a friend out—I did not miss them till the constable came next morning and told me they were gone Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Was your husband at home that night A Yes ill he was not doing duty at that time—I saw footmarks in the garden as if somebody had jumped over instead of coming in at the gate which was only latched—they could open it and come in—the railings are about four feet from the ground THOMAS WILLIAM CARTER police-inspector L I made this plan of Vauxhall-walk—I measured the distances myself—No 91 is 190 yards from the house where Cane and Hickey resided THEODORE EDWARD LADD I am a surgeon of Walcot-place Lambeth On 5th May about 3 o clock I was called up to the deceased—he was perfectly insensible—his face altogether was very much bruised—on his right eyebrow was a lacerated wound—on the left side of his head was a very extensive wound which communicated with a fracture of the skull—there was a piece of bone pressing on the brain—the wounds were bleeding and he was also bleeding from the nose and ears from which I inferred that the fracture of the skull extended across the base—there were no symptoms of rallying and I ordered him to the hospital—I afterwards heard of his death and consider it was caused by the fracture of the skull and the piece of bone pressing on the brain Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q You attribute the bleeding from the nose and ears to the blow on the left side A Yes his face was more swollen on the light side than the left—I am surgeon to the division—I was not summoned to the station to Cane—I saw that he had a wound over the eyebrow next morning at the police station—I did not examine it—it was not plaistered—the blood was not washed off WALTER REES I was house-surgeon at Gay s Hospital On 5th May the deceased was brought there insensible at 5 o clock in the morning—he died in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—on the 7th I assisted Dr Lloyd in making a post-mortem examination—there were five lacerated and contused wounds on the upper part of the face and head—one about an inch and a quarter long over the external angle of the right eyebrow another about 22 inch and a half long over the left eyebrow another on the left temple region communicating with an extensive fracture of the skull and one behind the ear rather smaller and another quite on the back of the head—the blows must have been numerous—no two wounds could have been produced by one blow—the scalp was infiltrated with blood in every direction—the temporal muscles on both sides were also much loaded with blood—I attribute death to compression from coagulated blood and from the bone which were produced by the fractures of the skull—the greatest fracture was on the left side—blows with such stones as these would produce such wounds MR BALLANTINE called ANN CONNELL I am the wife of John Connell of Justin-street Lameth On Sunday night 4th May I was at the collection at the White Line at 11 o clock—I did not see Cane in the house—I saw him on the pavement as I came out close upon 1 o clock—me and Cane and M Elligott went to where Cane lodges Mrs Cole s in Vauxhall-walk—while we stood in Mrs Cole s gate six or seven men and women came up singing from the White Lion—we stood there till they came up and passed—two policemen who I do not know were driving them telling them to go home—Cane laid hold of one of the policeman s hands and said Let them alone they are only singing they will go home quiet —the policeman attempted to withdraw his hand from Cane s—Cane held it and the policeman hit him with his staff on the head—I saw blood come—Elligott and me laid hold of him and asked him to go indoors and never mind what had happened but go in and keep out of the policeman s clutches—he went in doors the door was shut and I went home Cross-examined by MR RYLAND Q Have you seen either of the two policemen since A No I have seen plenty of police here to-day—I have not been op in the gallery at all to-day—I should not know the policemen if I were to see them—there was not a large party at the White Lion while I was there—I amused myself in going in and out two or three times to the pavement—my husband was not there—he was ill and sent me to supply the collection—I did not go inside Cane s gate—it did not take many minutes to walk from the White Lion to where this happened—it was close upon 1 o clock when we got to

half-an-hour before he came back with Harrington and Hickey—I opened the door for them—I do not know whether there was a light in the passage there was one down-stairs—the police bad got their lanterns when I saw Hickey in their hands and that was the first time I saw his head bleeding—when Cane went out after speaking to me in the passage he took a knife with him off the kitchen table down-stairs—he did not remain in the passage all the time MR PARNELL Q What did he do with the knife A I saw no more of it—I saw him lift it op in the kitchen whether he pot it down or not I do not

went into the front-room and found the deceased lying on the floor—she looked up and said Oh Mrs Staples my husband has stabbed roe to the heart —I said Oh Eastwood you have killed your wife —he said I hope not but do what you can for her —I stooped down and said What is the matter —she said He has done it at last he has stabbed me to the heart —he then said she had done it herself—I asked him to help me to raise her up—she said It is under my left breast —I took her things off one shoulder and then she bled very freely indeed—he carried her up-stairs kissed her and said he hoped she would do well Cross-examined Q You say you were very much alarmed can you positively state the exact order in which any of those expressions were used A I am quite confident as to what passed and quite confident the prisoner said I hope not when she said he had stabbed her to the heart—he seemed very much distressed almost paralysed WILLIAM WALKER policeman V 98 I was called to this house at half-past 10 o clock and saw the prisoner nursing a child in the front-room down-stairs—I said Bill how did this affair take place —he said I will tell you me and my wife had some words as I was having my supper I had a knife in my hand she ran against the knife and stabbed herself I am positive those were the words—I said You don t mean to tell me that Bill —he said no more—the doctor came and we all went up-stairs—I saw the woman with a wound about an inch long—I told Mr Brown in the prisoner s presence that if the woman was in a dangerous state I should take the prisoner into custody—the prisoner said You may find that ail out —I took him down to the room below asked him where the knife was and he gave it me off the table—it was bloody right down to the handle—this is it and the woman s clothes—I took the prisoner to the station MR BROWN I am a surgeon of Wandsworth I was called to the prisoner s house and found the deceased in bed with an incised wound about three inches below the left nipple rather more than an inch in extent and extending deeply—she was then in a state of collapse—she afterwards rallied and lived nearly eight days—I made a post-mortem examination and traced the wound through the integuments between the sixth and seventh ribs into the cavity of the chest not wounding the lungs but going about three inches into the liver—this knife would have inflicted such a wound—nearly the whole of the blade must have penetrated—it certainly could not have been inflicted by a person running against another who was holding a knife it would require considerable force—that wound was the cause of her death Cross-examined Q I am afraid it was a wound which must have been fatal A Yes I thought at first she might recover being unaware that the liver had been penetrated ALFRED TAYLOR I am chief clerk to the Magistrates at Wandsworth Police Court The deceased woman was examined and her deposition taken by the Magistrate in the prisoner s house and in his presence on a charge of stabbing with intent to murder—these are the depositions— read— Elizabeth Eastwood on her oath says I am the wife of the prisoner William Eastwood I was sitting in my rocking-chair last night in this house at the Point Wandsworth between 9 and 10 o clock the prisoner was sitting at his supper with a knife and fork in his hand we had some angry words and he ran at me with the knife in his hand and stabbed me with the knife while I was sitting in the chair that is the truth as I have not long to live in this world my neighbours came in and assisted me Cross-examined by the prisoner —The cause of our words was as is always the case for whenever he comes in-doors whoredom is in his mouth and he called me a whore last night I dare say I said he had had connection with his daughter I do not know whether he had been drinking Re-examined I did not mention anything about his daughter last night when we quarrelled it was on a former occasion John

t18520105-190  190 THOMAS BARE was indicted for the wilful murder of Louisa Bare MESSRS BODKIN and CLARK conducted the Prosecution FANNY KNOTT I live in Ryler-street Grosvenor-street The deceased Louisa Bare was my daughter and the prisoner s wife she had been married to him twenty years—I remember their living in Vineyard-gardens—I was there about five weeks before my daughter s death—I saw her there—I did not see the prisoner there but I met him as I was going home—he offered to speak to me and I told him to go along like a bad man as he was I had seen my daughter ill-used—he wished to speak to me and I told him I did not wish to have anything at all to say to him—that was all that passed on that occasion—I saw him again on the Thursday night before my daughter s death he came to my house my daughter was not then living with the prisoner—I knew that at the time—he asked me if I had seen the little boy—I told him I had not seen him since the morning he passed the top of the street with him—he asked me if I knew where his wife was—I said I did not—he said he would be revenged on some one he would do something to some one but he would not say who—he did not say anything more Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Just recollect yourself did he use such a term as being revenged A Yes and I told him vengeance belonged to the Lord that it was not for him to take revenge—I have always remembered that he used that term—I did not tell those who made inquiry about it before—they did not ask me whether I had seen him before or whether he said that be would be revenged—this if the first time I have stated it COURT Q Were you examined before the Coroner A No I was before the Magistrate—this is the first time I have said that he said he would be revenged SARAH ABRAHAMS I live at 5 Brooks -gardens Bagnigge-wells I know Mrs Hans—in Oct she was living at my house before the prisoner came after his wife—she had been there twelve months—during the time Mrs Hans was there another woman came to stay with her she called herself Mrs Bare—she came about a fortnight before her death—she stayed four nights and went away with Mrs Hans—a little boy my son by my first husband named Brackstone took two of the woman Bare s boxes away when she left—it was on a Friday evening they left—they both left together—on the Monday after that the prisoner came and said Have you a little woman living here I do not know her name she is a little short woman —I said I suppose you mean Mrs Hans —he said I do not know her name —I said I had a woman of that description and likewise a person they called Mrs Bare—when I mentioned Mrs Bare the prisoner said that was his wife he then asked if I had not had some boxes come there—I told him that there were two boxes but they were gone—he wanted to go up and see if his property was not in my place and I said Can t you believe me they are gone Mrs Hans and Mrs Bare went together Mrs Hans did not tell me she was going —he said Are you aware that I can go up and burst the door open if I thought my property was in your place —I said You will do nothing of the sort if you go and get authority you shall search the place but not before —he went away after that and came back the same day with a woman—he came again almost every day and said just the same and said I must know where they were gone to—I said I did not know and I did not—he came on Saturday the 8th about a quarter-past 6 o clock in the evening—I said I was going to send my little boy to see if Mrs Hans intended to come back again or to give up the key of the door and if he liked he could go and see if his wife was there for I did not know—he then went away—on the Friday night before he said he was afraid his wife was going on wrong and if he thought she should cone to be in the emaciated state his poor child was in he would sooner die it Newgate than see it—he did not say he would sooner be hung—I sent my little boy on the Saturday evening fur the key of my street door and the prisoner went with him—they left at about a quarter past 6 Cross-examined Q Did be say he was afraid his wife was going on badly A Yes I have seen his daughter once she came and asked if Mrs Hans and her mother were there and I said they were not—she is now down stairs—I do not know her age EDWARD BRACKSTONE I live with my mother Mrs Abrahams at 5 Brook s-gardens Bagnigge-wells I recollect Mrs Hans and Mrs Bare living with my mother—they left on a Friday night and I took two boxes for Mrs Bare on a barrow up to Marylebone—I do not know the name of the street—I think the number was 33—I remember the prisoner coming to my mother s on a Saturday night and I went to the same house where I had taken the boxes—I showed the prisoner the way—we left ray mother s house about half-past 6 o clock—it took us about three-quarters of an hour to walk—on the way we went first to a public-house in Leather-lane and then we went to one at the bottom of Holborn-hill but he did not have anything tardiest there—he stopped at three public-houses we went to one at the corner of the same street where I had taken the boxes and to a Jerry shop a little higher up—at the public-house he said that public-house was too open for him to sit in in case she might come in and then she would not go home—he then went to the Jerry shop and had some ale—before we went to the house he said he would try to take the boxes home that he would take one find I should take the other—we then went to No 33 and went into the parlour where we saw the landlord—the prisoner bad some conversation with him—I went out twice for beer and when I was coming in the second time the woman who had been at my mother s followed me in—we had then been in the house half or three-quarters of an hour during which time the prisoner had been in the parlour with the landlord and landlady—when the woman came in the landlord said to the prisoner That is her and he said Now don t you kick up any disturbance at all —the woman went up stairs—she did not see the prisoner—the prisoner took the candle and followed her up immediately—they had been up stairs a short time when the prisoner called to me and said My lad come and fetch the boxes downstairs—I went up stairs and found them talking together in a back room on the first floor standing near the window—I did not hear what they said they were talking very quiet and appeared to be friendly—the prisoner said pointing to a box Here my lad you take this box down stairs —I took the box and as I came out of the room the woman began screaming and I saw the prisoner hitting her—I put the box down went across the room to him and said What is the use of hitting your wife like that —he said Trouble your head with your own business —I saw him give her two or three blows about the breast before I left the room—he struck her in this way jobbing down—I did not see anything in his hand the was screaming out when I left the room and as I was going down stairs she screamed out Murder —he said Make haste —there were two or three persons on the staircase—she did not scream Murder before I left the room—I did not see or hear any person speak to the prisoner before I went down stain with the box—I put the box in the parlour went up again to fetch the other down and as I was going up I met the prisoner on the stairs coming down and he said to me You bring the other box down and I will carry it away —I went into the room and saw the woman lying by the fireplace—there were two or three persons by the door but none in the room—the woman was kneeling down and leaning up against the fireplace on her knees—I did not hear her speak or groan—there was blood on her face—I took the box down stairs and put it outside the door of the house—the prisoner was then gone—I left a person at the door to mind the box and went down the street and saw him on the left hand side by a baker s shop—I saw blood on his right hand—I said to him You come hack you have killed your wife —he said No I have not —I said You have —he said If I have you tell the policeman —I told a policeman who was on the opposite side by the public-house—during the time I was in the room when I went to fetch the first box I did not see the woman strike the prisoner at all Cross-examined Q What was done just before the man hit his wife or what took place the moment before what was she doing how was she situated A They were standing up talking together—I did not hear any scream before he hit her directly he hit her she began to scream—I saw the first blow struck—they were talking together before that by the fireplace but I do not know what about—they were standing opposite to each other—I cannot recollect what was said—I did not hear her use any ill language to him—I did not hear him ask her about any man who used to visit her—I did not hear him mention a man named Thompson—she was angry about the boxes going and when I went in to take them she said Oh you cruel boy to take them boxes away —I did not hear her say she would not have them go—I only knew her by her living at our house—I know a person named Thompson who lives in Bath-street—I never saw him with her —I did not see anything in the prisoner s hand or the woman s—I was quite close to them and looking at them—I saw the hand with which the prisoner struck his wife—if there had been anything in it I think I mast have sees it COIUR Q Still he struck in that sort of way as a person would do who was stabbing A Yes MR BALLANTINE Q Did she begin screaming more violently after you left the room A Yes after I left the room she began screaming out Murder —the screams were of quite a different kind to what they were before—he was striking her when I left the room—I was nearly at the bottom of the stairs when I heard the cry of Murder —that did not take me two minutes COURT Q Are you sure he had not given her a blow before the one you saw A I saw him give her the first blow when I was in the room but she had not screamed before that—he could not have given her a blow before that while I was in the room—I must have seen it GERORGE LANNEY I keep the house 33 North-street Marylebone—the deceased lodged at my house a fortnight in the back room on the first-floor—I knew her by the name of Knott—I remember the prisoner coming I opened the door to him the last witness was with him—the prisoner asked me if Mrs Bare was at home—I said I knew no such name and repeated the names of the lodgers till I said There is a Miss Knott and Mrs Hans lodging together —on my mentioning that the prisoner said Knott is my wife s maiden name —he went on to state that there was property of his in the house that a daughter of mine had got his wife away to lodge in my house with her—that was false—I replied that I had daughters but no connection of theirs—I told him Mrs Hans was not my daughter—he said there was property of his in the house and he would burst open every door but what he would have it—he said he had two boxes—I told him if there was property of his I would assist in getting it but to have a policeman rather than burst the door open because I thought it was not legal being a furnished house and a lodging-house—I said if his boxes were there this Miss Knott would be in at 9 o clock she was so regular I could depend upon her—I asked him to walk into the parlour which he did and sat down with me for a long time—I remained with him—he said a great deal to me too much for me to relate—we were together nearly an hour and twenty-five minutes—he spoke in very bad terms of his wife and said she and the other one were nothing bat two prostitutes and did I know I had such character in the house—I suppose by the other one he meant Mrs Hans—I said as far as I knew I had never seen or known anything wrong—his wife came home at about five minutes to 9—I did not see any one with her—she went along the passage and up stairs—the parlour door was open and the prisoner could have seen her and I believe he did—while she was in the passage I said This is the good woman you want to see and I put a candlestick and lighted candle in his hand and he followed her up stairs with the candle in his hand—I then went out into North-street in pursuit of a policeman for fear of a disturbance—I did not think of doing that before I was only afraid there would be a piece of work—when I returned with a policeman it was all over I found my wife bathing the woman s temples—I believe she was then dead COURT Q Where did you find her when you went back A She was in her own room in the act of lying back Cross-examined Q Had the boy come for the boxes before the prisoner came to the house A Yes the same evening—my wife then answered the door—she is here—I had never spoken to Miss Knott and had never been into her room—the prisoner wanted to get the boxes before his wife came home—I think it was his intention by his words to have broken the door open REBECCA LANNEY I am last witness s wife On Saturday 8th Nov the boy Brackston came for some boxes which I refused to let him have until proper authority was given—in a short time the prisoner came back with the boy and sat with me and my husband in the parlour for an hour and a half—the woman came home and went up stairs and the prisoner went up after her—my husband went out for a policeman and I stood on the mat at the foot of the stairs and heard talking in the room up stairs—I believe the door was closed I could not hear what passed they were talking quietly—after they had been talking a short time I heard the prisoner call to the boy to come up stairs—I was in the passage at the time and told the boy to go—the boy went up the prisoner opened the door and I heard him tell the boy to take the boxes down—I did not hear anything particular until that time—I went with a candle to the door to see if I could see my husband and then the screeching began—I went back to the foot of the stairs and heard great screeching and a fall as if a table or drawers had fallen over—the boy was then bringing down the boxes—the screaming continued after the fall for about a minute and a half or two minutes and then the prisoner came down—I had not noticed the boy go up for the second box I think be must have gone up while I was on the step—I was going up stairs when I saw the prisoner coming down and I turned back and opened the door for him—I noticed his hand was smeared with blood—he went out into the street—I closed the door and immediately went up stairs to the woman s room—when I went into the room she was kneeling as it were on one knee over a chain which had been thrown across the fender—her hair was scattered about her face—I put my hand and put it back—her eyes were wide open looking upwards—she was resting on the chair her hand was clutched about half open and half shut—there was a wound on her cheek from which blood was flowing—she bad no bonnet on I think it was in the fender—she half a victorine round her throat—I took it off and put my hand there to see whore the blood came from I did not know at first—I did not see any blood there only on her face and I took some water and threw it on her face—she did not speak after I got in she struggled and I thought she was in a fit she made a noise and threw her head back but yor eyes never moved—the doctor Mr Davison soon afterwards came but she was dead before be came—I should say it was from five to eight minutes after the prisoner left that the doctor came—I had not been into the room before they had only been with me a fortnight Cross-examined Q Were you in the habit of going into her room A I had never been before I cannot say whether she was in the habit of using any tools COURT Q She was there a fortnight A Yes exactly—I never saw but one visitor during that time that was a male—he called on the Sunday after she came—I believe his name was Thompson—I have since heard that is his name—he was not called so—when he came he rang the bell—I opened the door and he inquired for Miss Kuott—he did not say who he wanted—the deceased heard him and was coming down at the time—she went back again and he went up-stairs with her—I do not know when he came down again—I did not tee him go—I believe Mrs Hans was at home at the time—she was at home before and I am not aware that she was gone out SELINA BECKETT I am the wife of Charles Beckett a printer and live in the front-room first-floor of this house—I knew the deceased she went by the name of Miss Knott and lived in the adjoining room—another woman named Hans lodged there—they both slept in that room—on 8th Nov about half-past seven in the evening I was in my room the deceased came home—I did not Ree her—I heard footsteps a few minutes before nine and heard her go into her own room—a few minutes afterwards I heard the footsteps of another person following bar up stairs and a few minutes after they both got into the room the door was shut—I heard quarreling between them—I heard him call her a blasted b - - ch—soon after he-come in said I wish to take away the boxes —he accused her of being at a low public-house—he mentioned the name of it which I do not remember—after that he said she was with some low prostitutes—she said So help me God I was not there —that transpired—I went downstairs—I have told you all that transpired—I heard him say he would not go out without the boxes and she said If you will sit down I will explain everything to you —the last words I heard him say were blasted b - - I—then ran down-stairs to tell the landlady they were quarreling—she was standing on the step of her door—I then returned into my own room—I heard nothing then but I ran up quick shut the door directly and as soon as Dgot in heard a scream of Murder —I came out of my room—the back-room door was wide open—I saw a boy standing just within the door who had come to fetch the boxes away—he had a box on his shoulder—the deceased and the prisoner were in the room against the window fighting—the prisoner had his right hand raised striking several heavy blows—she did not strike him—they were standing close together they fell down together and they never appeared to be separate—she seemed to have hold of him—she neither struck or attempted to strike him in my presence—I saw him strike her four or five heavy blows before she fell—I did not see that he had anything in his hand to strike her with—I could see nothing but his clenched fist—he struck like this downwards —she was stooping down while he was striking her she called Murder four or five times—I did not hear her say anything else—he did not say anything to her—I said to the boy who was standing near the door Go and take him away —and the boy said I shall not touch him for it serves her Joilly well right —after she was on the ground she raised herself up again and he got up too and by that time she had reached the fireplace and then he struck her five or six more heavy blows which appeared to be on the head and face—her hack was to me—she did not attack him or strike him when she got up—when she raised herself she had got hold of him round the waist it appeared but his back was to me—I could not see her hands after the last blow she fell on the fender and he came out of the room and passed me on the mat—I cannot say where the last blow was struck—her back was towards me then and there was a very dim light a candle in the middle of the table—it is a small square room about as large as from me to that lamp—the fireplace faces you as you go into the room—it was at the fireplace she died—the prisoner said nothing to me as he left the room—I did not see him go out of the house but he went down-stairs—he passed close by me—I could not see whether he had anything in his hands at that time—I was too much frightened Q You say she said nothing but did you say anything to the prisoner A Nothing after he had gone out I stood and looked at the woman a few minutes hesitating whether I should go into the room or not—she sat with her face down and her hair down and her eyes fixed—I noticed blood running down her face and about the room and on the hearth—I ran down to the landlady and in about ten minutes saw the woman dead Cross-examined Q Was not this the last observation that was made did not he say I want nothing of you but my boxes and so help me God I won t leave the house without them A Yet that is what he did say but it was not the last that was spoken—that was said just before the last expression—I was examined before the Coroner—I told him to the best of my recollection that the boy said I shall not touch him for it serves her jolly well right —what I said was taken down in writing and read over to me I signed it—I will not say that I stated before the Coroner that the boy said it served her jolly well right because I do not know whether he asked me—I think I did say it but I would not swear it—I only answered the questions put to me COURT to EDWARD BRACKSTONE Q Have you been in Court and heard this young woman s evidence A Yes I did not say to my recollection that it served the woman jolly well right—I never spoke to her MR BALLANTINE Q Such an expression as that ought never to be forgotten can you say whether or not you used such an expression to her A I am sure I did not COURT Q Why did not you interfere when the man was beating the woman A Me interfere Sir what could I do —I could not have done any I good to him—I could not lay hold of him and pull him off—I had not been I drinking at three public-houses with the prisoner—I drank at two—we had I two pints of beer between us—we smoked—I am eighteen years old EMMA WEBSTER I am the wife of Thomas Webster of this house in North-street Manchester-square I recollect the deceased who went by the I name of Miss Knott coming home on Saturday night—my room is the back—I parlour and she occupied the room over me—I heard her go up into her room and heard some one fallow her—I heard loud talking in the room—I distinctly heard Miss Knott say So help me God with some short Christian name I have not done it —I heard a man swear I believe it was the prisoner—I heard screams about two minutes after she said So help me God I have not done it —I almost immediately heard him call the boy to fetch the boxes—the boy passed me on the stairs to go for the boxes and I crossed any room to the window and heard the first blow struck and the woman scream—I then went part of the way up stairs nearly to the top and could hear the woman s voice—she called Murder two or three times—her last words were Oh he has murdered me —the boy was in the room at that time—I lost my sight in the fright the prisoner touched my dress as be went out—I was very much alarmed MARY ROBINSON I am the wife of Samuel Robinson a stonemason of 5 Half-moon-passage Aldersgate-street—I was acquainted with the prisoner and his late wife—after she had left him he came to my house to make inquiries of me about her—I knew where she was for a little time I could not tell him at that time—about a fortnight before she died he came to my house one morning and asked me whether I knew where his wife was—I said no I did not—he said I have heard of my wife she is 100 miles away nursing an old lady I don t mind tramping 100 miles to have revenge for revenge is sweet —he said if he could trace out where the boxes went that was what he wanted Q Just tell us how he said it what did he say first A He said I have heard yesterday my wife is 100 miles away I don t mind tramping 100 miles so long as I can trace out where the boxes went to for revenge is sweet —I said Why should you think wrong of your wife did you ever find her doing wrong —he made this reply to me Why I do not know I have seen her making up some finery and that is only fit for a loose woman in the street —that was the remark he made to me—I said You know nothing wrong of her —he said No I have always found her just from the very first hour she met with me to the hour she left me —he sent a letter to me the following day—he said he would not come any more—I could not tell him where she lived because I did not know at that time—he wanted me if I could tell him where she was to come there for a few minutes—he wanted me to make some appointment—I said I could not tell I knew where she was at work where I sent him but she was only there for a day or two—in the course of that conversation he said If I catch hold of her she will repent it he would lay his hand on her and she would not forget it—I think the phrase was She will repent it as near as I can say REBECCA LYNAM I am the wife of Robert Lynam of Friars-street Blackfriars-road he sells tools I heard of the death of the woman in Marylebone from a policeman who called on a Monday I forget the date—ten days or a fortnight before that I cannot be certain which a man who I believe to be the prisoner to the best of my belief came and bought a flat file—on the same day about twenty minutes afterwards but I am not certain he came back and said the file did not answer his purpose and wished me to change it—I said No I shall not change it because I do not think you bought it here —he pulled something out of his pocket and said Yes I did I b ought this at the same time to convince me that he bought the file there—he selected another file a triangular one or three-cornered one I think they call it a saw-file—this produced is the sort of file and it is also of the same magnitude—we had several of the kind at one time and we had one or two left at the time this was bought—to the best of my belief it was the prisoner who changed the file—I have not sworn that it was him—there is the maker s name on this file and on others that we have—we had one or two files in the shop with the maker s name on them after selling a similar file to this—the policeman took one of them away this produced is it because it has a broken point—the maker s name is Robinson—that is not my husband s name—I cannot say whether the file I sold was sharp of blank but it was rusty because we never clean any tools Cross-examined Q You have been asked about this mass a great number of times who came and found you A A policeman came and asked me when I had sold files last—if the prisoner is the man this is the file he first bought to the best of my belief looking at one —he bought a file that was not sharp at the top at all—he brought it back in about twenty minutes I do not swear to the file or to the man—I did not notice any maker s name on the second file he bought before I sold it—I know now that the other files have got Robinson s name on them but I had not looked previously—we are marine-store dealers—we had bought these with a lot of old files together—we do not take account of everything we buy—we do not look over them carefully to see if they are made by the same people—a good many people come to oar place—I speak to the prisoner to the best of my belief by seeing him come back to change the file if he is not the man I am very much deceived and shall never again think of recognizing a person a second time—he was dressed similar to what the prisoner is now fustian trowsers a dark coat and a hat—he was a man of middle height—I cannot recollect whether he paid 1 1/2 d 2d or 1d —we sell everything that is brought to us—we have knives sometimes I do not know whether we have any at the present moment COURT Q You deal in marine-stores A Yes a person might bring a dozen odd files to me and I should buy them—ours is not like an ironmonger s shop where files and knives are bought by the gross or the dozen—we buy anything that cornea—we bought a lot of files of the same person bat I cannot recollect who the person was—the file I ultimately sold the man was one bought of the same person—they were mixed with other tools—we pick them out—they were not put in brown paper together we do not have anything in paper—they were brought like workmen s tools like a man giving up business or leaving his employment—I do not know whether Robinson is a very common maker s name for tools—I should not have seen this if my attention had not been called to it when the comparison was made by the policeman CHARLES RUSSELL I am a paper-hanger I was at the door of Mr Lynam s shop when a man came to change a file—I did not take much notice of him—I cannot tell you how he was dressed—I did not see him come in he was outside when I saw him—I cannot say whether the prisoner is the man Cross-examined Q You do not feel any certainty on the subject A No I cannot tell how the man was dressed—he had a hat on—I did not notice his trowsers or coat—he was rather round in the shoulders—I slightly looked at him COURT Q What were you doing at the door A Hanging out some I things for Mrs Lynam—the man went to the right-hand side of the shop I where the files and tools were kept—I did not see him go into the shop or I come out—the things are all kept outside—I heard him say This file will I not do —she said You did not buy it here and he palled something else I out and then I went inside the shop and left them outside—I had no occasion I to take particular notice of him and cannot swear he is the man JOSEPH CHURCH policeman D 129 On 8th Nov I was on duty at the corner of North-street and South-street Manchester-square about 9 o clock I or as near as possible and saw the prisoner at the corner of the Bedford Arms having a glass of something I think it was gin—he came out of the I house and said to me Are you going to do anything in this —I said I In what —he said I have done a something —his voice faltered very I much—I said What have you done — OH he said something between me and my wife —I said What is it where is it —he then I turned from me and crossed to the other corner—he appealed to bare been I drinking—I do not think he was drunk—at the time be left me and crossed the road the boy Blackstone—came up and made a communication to me on which I went up to the prisoner and said Will you go along with me Oh yes he said—I west with him to 33 North-street—there was another constable coming after me—there was a box at the door of the house and the prisoner said If it bad not been for these boxes or trunks this would not have happened —I took the prisoner into the parlour left hint there in charge of another constable went up to the back-room first-floor and saw a woman lying with her bead and shoulders on the fender apparently the landlady and another person were in the room at the time—I observed seven wounds on the deceased s face—there was much blood about the room—I found in the room these two halves of the handle of a file one within a yard or two of the door and the other by the fireplace and I found a file in between the bars of the grate sloping down between the bars—there was do fire—it was as if it had been thrown in there—it was resting on the cinders and the grate in this way—there are three or four bars I will not be certain which—there was blood on the handle I picked up and on the blade—this is the blade—I sent for a surgeon immediately—I found a cap in the fireplace—the point of the file was sharp as it is now when I found it—it appears to have been recently ground WILLIAM HORATIO GOFF policeman D 249 I assisted in taking the prisoner from the house in North-street to the station on this charge—he said She my wife took a chisel or something of the sort to strike me with I dragged it from her and gave her the contents —his right hand was covered with blood—his left hand was not so bad—there was blood on his chin—I conveyed him to the station and found 4s 1 1/2 d on him—he asked me at the station several times whether his wife was dead—I told him I did not know—some one was sent from the station to North—street to inquire—I afterwards heard a policeman named Jackson state in the prisoner s hearing that she was dead on which I understood him to say Lord Christ Almighty —he said I have a boy in bed at a public-house little does he think I have murdered his mother —he said I have a daughter a prostitute on the town who would have thought I had the heart to have done it I wish I was going to be hung to-morrow at 8 o clock —this was on Saturday night—he then said No at this present moment Cross-examined Was the expression he used He little thinks I have murdered his mother did he use the expression murdered A Killed or murdered I could swear more to killed than to the other—I searched him and found this apron in his right-hand pocket this cap in his left pocket a broken pair of spectacles and 4s 1 1/4 d —it was Church who found the file MR BALLANTINE to JOSEPH CHURCH Q You searched the room where the file was found did you not A Yes I found no other tools of any kind—I searched so as to know whether there were any—I looked into the cupboards ROBERT JACKSON I was inspector on duty at the station on Saturday night 8th Nov —I remember the prisoner being brought there by Goff—he was decidedly under the influence of drink—I sent some one to the house in North-street to see whether the woman was alive—intelligence was brought back that she was dead—on my telling the prisoner that his wife was dead he rose himself to his full height put both hands to his head and Raid God dead dead God Christ Almighty —he laid his head on the edge of the dock and was excessively agitated for several minutes—when he recovered a little he said Oh that you could kill me now but you have not the power oh that I could be hung this moment but thank God I am now at rest —while he was being searched he said It is too late now or I would have provided myself with a something and then I should have saved you and everybody else trouble I did not think I should lose it —he was locked up in the cell at night a constable named Hall was placed with him—I have got the victorine it is pierced in several places in the right breast and shoulder and other places by a triangular hole Cross-examined Q Had anything been said about the file A Decidedly so it had been shown to him—I did not hear him say he had wrenched the file from his wife s hand—it was about half-past 9 o clock when he was brought to the station—he made use of the last expression at about a quarter past 11 JOHN HALL policeman D 64 I was appointed to stay with the prisoner at the station on the night on which he was taken—I was locked up in the cell with him—he was put in the cell a little after 10 o clock and in about 5 minutes he began to speak to me—the inspector ordered me to remain with him and be careful to have nothing to say to him but whatever he said I was to notice—he asked me if his wife was dead I said Yes you have been told by the inspector your wife is dead —he said Well I done it and this is the arm that done it lifting up his right arm—he said afterwards anyone that would take the life of another ought to be served the same he should neither employ counsel or Judge but should plead guilty—he also said that if it had not been for the boy who directed him to the house it never would have happened—he said in bringing the big box out of the room his wife got hold of him turned round to him and said Now old fellow you have not got all that he then immediately turned round and struck her or attacked her I think he said struck her Q You have been examined before was not what he said this If it had not been for the boy showing me where the boxes were this would not have happened A Where the house was he did not say anything about the boxes Cross-examined Q A man s life may depend on words you know just recollect yourself were not the words he said or at all events the words you attribute to him If it had not been for the boy showing me where the boxes were it would not have happened A That is right Sir—no that is wrong Where the house was —I take upon myself to swear the expression was Where the house was not Where the boxes Were—I swear it is not as you have put it to me because he would not have known the house if it had not been for the boy COURT Q What did he say he said it never would hate happened if what A If it had not been for the boy showing him where the house was not where the boxes were because the boy could not tell—his expression was that it never would have happened if the boy had not shown him where the house was Q Did he say If it had not been for the boy directing me where the boxes were it never would have happened A Yes it was inspector Jackson that desired me to be in the cell—he is here NATHANIEL DAVIDSON I am a surgeon On 8th Nov between 8 and 9 I o clock I was called to 33 North-street—I went up to the back-room firstfloor and found a woman there quite dead blood was flowing from various wounds in her face neck and other parts of her body—I observed I six or seven wounds on her face there were sixteen wounds in front of I the body altogether which I counted and from afterwards seeing the I pelisse she wore there must have been more—about nine of the wounds I were on the body—they were all done by the same instrument they I were every one of a triangular shape—such an instrument as this tile I would have inflicted them—I opened the body afterwards—the wound I mast have penetrated to the back part of the throat fracturing the bone in its progress—it pierced the angle of the eye fracturing the bone—it was I not high enough to touch any portion of the brain—it would require very considerable force to fracture the bone there—the first rib was fractured—the most serious wound was on the first rib on the left side a short distance from the breast bone—it passed through the large pulmonary artery leading from the heart that wound of itself was quite sufficient to have calked death—the wound was just the size of the file—the hemorrhage from that artery would make death certain Cross-examined Q You examined her body carefully A Yes I did not observe any bruises on her body except a considerable bruise on the angle of the left eye where there was a punctured wound—I did not see any bruise where there was no wound—I think I must have seen them if there had been for I examined the forepart of the body very minutely—the cause of death was so obvious I did not enter into minute anatomy—I did not examine the back part I judge of the wounds there by the tippet COURT Q Did you first make an external examination before you used the knife to the body A I examined the wounds in the face first—I did that minutely and also the head and trunk but until I opened the body I could not tell whether the pulmonary artery was cut—I discovered on bruises except those that were round the different wounds MARY HANS I come here from the Marylebone Infirmary I knew the deceased—she lodged in the same room with me at Brooks-gardens and moved with me to the room in North-street—nobody but us lived in that room—she got her living by going to work with me at feather bonnets in Wigmore-street—she was I think about forty years of age about my own age—she was a little taller than me but not much—I do not think she was a very strong woman—I never saw such a thing as this file in the room at North-street Cross-examined Q Had you anything to do with this woman leaving her husband A Nothing I did not tell her fortune or anything of that kind—I never did such a thing as that—I have known her since the latter end of Sept or Oct —a man named Thompson came to visit her—I have never said to her nor to anybody that Thompson would be her stem husband—Thompson came once about half-past 8 o clock or later than that—three times was all that ever be came—a friend of mine had laid his wife out and nursed his child—I have not seen the deceased working at wood or boxes—I never saw her at work except on the work she took in COURT Q Did you see Thompson at North-street A Yes we never saw him till we went to North-street and then he came to tell Mrs Bare about her husband—he staid half or three-quarters of an hour—I was in the room all the time—he called three times in North-street and saw her three time—I was present each time—I observed no familiarity whatever between them—he did not kiss her or put his arms round her waist or treat her improperly quite the reverse—he only treated her with common friendship MR BALLANTINE Q You used to visit her did you not before she left her husband A Never but once no I beg your pardon twice—on one of those occasions I saw the prisoner s daughter there—I did not tell bet fortune nor did I tell her mother s at the same time—I hardly know the girl—I do not know whether I have seen her here to-day—I have had quarrel with her—she threatened my life but I was not aware of it at the time and yesterday she attacked me in the office COURT to MRS LYNAM Q Take that file to your band was the file in that condition when you sold it A No Sir rusty as I stated before—it was rusty all over at both ends—I sold it without a handle JURY Q Can you swear it was not ground at the point A It was not ground but it was not broken—we sold it in a rusty state all over—it was not polished at the end as it is now MR BALLANTINE called JOHN TAYLOR I am a master tobacco-pipe manufacturer I have known the prisoner twenty-three years—he worked for me the last work he did—he is a humane and peaceable man COURT Q Do you know anything of this large file A We use such at this in pipe-making for our instruments and for moulds and differed articles we work with but we do not use such files as the smaller one James Hillier William Taylor of Richmond William Snell James Wood and James Kennerly all tobacco-pipe makers gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY of manslaughter Aged 43 — Transported for Life 
t18521025-1043  1043 JAMES PHILLIPS was indicted for the wilful murder of Ann Matthews —2nd COUNT of Ann Brown —He was also charged on the Coroner s inquisition with the like murder MR DEARSLEY conducted the Prosecution MARY RICHARDSON I am a widow I lived at 11 Shepherd-street in the service of the deceased—her name was Ann Matthews—for a long time she went by the name of Brown but her proper name was Ann Matthews—she was always called Brown while I lived there—I know the prisoner—the deceased was his aunt—he had lived there a little better than two years—they lived together like man and wife—on Saturday evening 8th Oct the prisoner left home a little before the candles were lighted about dusk—it had struck 12 when he returned home—he was then betwixt and between as to drinking but he was perfectly aware of what he was doing—the deceased was sitting on the hearth-rug with her feet towards the fender in the back parlour—that was the room in which they slept—she sent for a pot of beer—the girl Sarah May went for it—she prisoner came in while she was sitting on the hearth-rug but she had been sitting there a good bit before he came in—when he came in he turned the bedclothes down the first thing with the intention of going to bed and he told the girl to go to bed likewise—he then called his aunt a very improper name and said she was sitting in a dirty position before the fire—the deceased replied Jem you can go back where you came from I can do without you and I don t want you here —he then jumped up and with his fist he gave her a violent blow on each side of the temple but it did not bleed it was bruised but did not bleed—he took her head like that describing it and hit her violently with both hands on each side of the head—the prisoner was standing up behind the deceased at the time he struck her—I begged him not to do it as it was getting Sunday morning Q What kind of blows were these as to violence A Why he could not do no more than he did with his doubled fist—she told him it would be the last time he should ever hit her for the next day she would swear her life against him—I did not observe anything on her forehead or any other part at that time—there was then a ring at the bell and I went to the door—I had not gone above three or four steps at the furthest before I heard the deceased say Oh Mary —I was not absent three minutes I am positive from the short distance I went—I returned to the room immediately—when I went in the prisoner s boots stood alongside of my mistress—I took them up and put them under the foot of the bed and went to her assistance—she was then lying flat on her back with her feet still towards the fireplace—I directly went to try to lift her up and I said to the prisoner Jem you have killed your aunt at least she is quite dead —I got a pillow to put under her head and there was apparently a little bit of sound in her throat but she was quite dead—the prisoner did not assist me then when I asked him he did—he sat on the foot of his bed but he did not offer to lie down—I said to him Jem will you assist me to raise your aunt up she is quite dead —I was stooping down over her and he instantly came and sent me away from her be took me by my clothes and hoisted me towards the parlour door away from her as I was trying to pick her up—he then stood on my right hand near the fireplace—he had neither boots nor stockings on nothing but his shirt and as he stood there he said to me Look here and he took his foot and projected it down upon her stomach three or four times but I did not count it I was too frightened—he then told me to take a light and go to bed and leave her she was right enough—he then said There is nobody can make you open your mouth if they say anything it is sure to be hanged or transported —I said to him Will you assist me and raise your aunt on the bed —he said If you will lay hold of her feet I will lay hold of her head and we did so and laid her on the bed—he then went to bed himself and laid on his side and covered himself over—he said Take the light and go to bed I am not afraid of being in the dark with her —I said I would have a doctor or some medical advice—he got out and put his boots on without any stockings and said I will fetch a doctor she shall soon have a doctor —he went to Mr Westlake s a neighbour s house—Mr Clark a doctor came—the deceased was in very good health when I saw her sitting on the hearth-rug—she was quite sober then COURT Q What do you mean by then A Why she was in the habit of drinking a little gin and water but she was lying down she often laid down—she had not been drinking at all that evening MR DEARSLEY Q Were you sober or drunk A I was perfectly sober as sober as I am now for I never drink any spirits Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q This place was a brothel was it not A Yes I had been there eight years—the deceased had had the house during the whole of that period and before I went there—the prisoner had only been living there for two years—a brother of his lived there before him for a little while as a porter but he died in the Fever Hospital—there is a sofa in the room—when I returned from answering the ring at the bell I found my mistress lying straight back on the floor with her feet towards the fire—her head was not close to the sofa she was too far away from the sofa I am positive of that—there was a good space between her and the sofa I cannot tell exactly what space—the back of her head was near the drawers nearer than the sofa—there was a chest of drawers as well as a sofa—her head was not touching the drawers there was room for me to put my hands down behind to try to raise her head up—after the prisoner struck her in the way I have described a potboy from a public house came in and brought a paper and put it in her lap—I brought the deceased s spectacles in to her but she did not begin to read the paper—she put them on for the purpose of reading—I was not absent more than three minutes I only went to the door and back immediately—I did not return when she cried out Oh Mary I went to answer a lady and gentleman that came but I heard no bustle in the room while I was gone—I did not attend to the lady and gentleman they did not come in I only answered them at the door—the room where this occurred was the back parlour on the ground floor as you come in at the door—I did not go out to drink during the three minutes—at the time the prisoner put his foot on the deceased s chest she was quite dead—he had neither shoes nor stockings on then—she was lying on the floor flat on her hack—he said to me There is nobody can make you open your mouth if you say anything we are sure to he transported or something of that kind—I have mentioned that before to-day—I have been waiting about here for this trial—I have been in the public houses opposite—I did not say there that I wished this man might be hung—I did not say so Q I warn you to be extremely careful in answering my questions upon the solemn oath you have taken to speak the truth did you not say over the way at a public house that you wished this man should be hung A If you had been in the place and saw what I saw you would have thought to too COURT Q Then did you say you hoped he would be hanged A Yes I did Sir MR PARRY Q Then when you answered my question No just now it was a falsehood was it A Certainly I did say so I beg your pardon—I did say I wished he would be hung—I did not repeat it—two or three times I might say it I do not know whether I said so on two or three different occasions I only said it to the same party that was there—the remainder of the other persons that are coming in I mean the witnesses Q Did you not go out and point out the spot where you said he would be hung A That I could not do COURT Q Did you not point out any place as the place where he would be hanged A No I never saw anything erected in my life where he could be hung—I did not say that MR PARRY Q I am not asking you what you said did not you go to a place near here and tell some persons with whom you were that that would be the place where he would be hung A No I was shown the place but I did not say so myself—I was not asking for the place—I do not know how I came to be shown the place I was not asking to be shown it Q How came you then to be shown it A I thought if ever he came back again I might stand the same chance as his aunt I did not wish him to come back again—I do not now wish him to be hanged and if it was to do any good I would as soon be hung up as him COURT Q When did you change your mind about it A I never changed my mind at all no more than that saying he deserved it MR PARRY Q How came it that you were shown the place where he was to he hung A That I do not know—I cannot tell you anything about it for I never saw a gallows erected nor anybody on it in my life—somebody showed me the place where they came out—I do not know how they came to do so—if you ask the other people that are here maybe they can tell you better—I do not know how I came to be shown the place—if any one was to say look here and show me I should look—I cannot say who showed me the place—there were others there and you can ask them who it was that said it COURT Q Were you all together in a party at the time A Yes I was sitting by the fireplace and never got up when they went to look at the window—all the witnesses were sitting together in the room at the time MR PARRY Q had gone to that place had you not for the purpose of looking at this window A No I was taken there to sit among the people that were there in the warm as I was very ill Q Did your late mistress ever beat you at all A Beat me no she has shoved me before now if I did not do anything I had to do quick enough—she was a very clever woman in her work Q Has she not repeatedly shoved you when you did not do what she wanted you to do A Well I was more shoved by the other party a great deal—she has repeatedly shoved me—she never beat me—she has sometimes turned me out of doors in the middle of the night when we had a few words—she has said There is the door go about your business —she has pushed me—she has sometimes violently pushed me out of doors in the middle of the night that is a long while back not lately—I never drink anything but a drop of porter—my mistress had but a little drop of gin and water that day—she only sent for 6d worth and that was there long enough and she drank about a wine glass full with hot water to it—she was correct and sober there are plenty of people can tell that—she had a little tumbler and she might have had something in that—there was a little glass as well—she never drank it without water—she never drank rum or brandy only gin SARAH NYE I am a single woman—I lived with the deceased for one week before this occurrence On the night of 8th Oct I supped with my mistress at half past 11 o clock—the prisoner came in just at 12—he told me to go to bed—I said I would not till my mistress had told me—my mistress was sober enough at that time—she had been lying down on the sofa—she was quite sober—I went to bed by my mistress s orders directly after the prisoner came in—I saw the prisoner again at about half past 12 that same night—he came to my bedroom door and said Get up get up Bet d—n thee come out in thy shirt your mistress is dying she is dead we shall be transported we shall all be hung —I went into the parlour and saw my mistress on the bed—I saw a graze on her forehead and I said Oh oh my mistress has had a blow —the prisoner said D—n thee Bet hold thy tongue —the doctor was sent for—Mr Westlake went for him—the prisoner went to Mr Westlake—the doctor noticed the graze on the forehead and said What is this on the forehead —the prisoner said She has fell off the sofa —I said No she has not and he said D—n thee hold thy tongue Bet FRANCIS CLARK I am a surgeon and live at 14 Henrietta-street Cavendish-square Between 1 and 2 o clock on Sunday morning 10th Oct I was called by a man named Westlake to see the deceased—in consequence of what he said to me I sent my son to No 11 Shepherd-street not being able to dress so quickly as usual from having had a fall and injured my wrists—I followed him—I had known Mrs Brown the deceased half a year previously—I had been called to attend her in May last for the first time and I had subsequently been called—when I got to 11 No Shepherd-street I saw the deceased in the parlour lying on the bed—observing some marks on her forehead I took the old woman aside into the passage—I examined the forehead and found the marks of a blow on each temple—the one on the left side was slight—that on the right side was more severe and the skin was slightly abraided—I should say the deceased was between fifty and sixty years of age—when I observed the marks the prisoner said she had fallen against the sofa—I am confident he said against the sofa—I made a post mortem examination on the Tuesday following—I found on the external part of the body various marks of bruises of long standing—a severe bruise on the left hip extending on to the back and the two marks before mentioned on the temples—the mark that extended to the back was apparently recent—the old bruises were in various parts and she had on a plaster—I examined the head on removing the skull-cap and the dura mater I found a coagulum of effused venous blood on each side corresponding with the external bruise—there was effusion of liquid venous blood in the ventricles at the base of the brain and all through a general effusion—I saw quite sufficient to account for the death—the cause of death was effusion and extravasation from the rupture of a vessel from concussion of the brain—that was caused by external blows—there is no doubt that a violent blow on each side of the head would cause what I observed—it is impossible to say what time would elapse before a person would die after receiving such a blow—it might be longer or shorter—it does not follow that death would be immediate—it would mainly depend upon the size of the vessel so ruptured—I examined the chest and abdomen—all the vital organs were perfectly healthy throughout unusually healthy—I examined the contents of the stomach it contained about from half to three quarters of a pint of fluid apparently of a natural kind but there was no appearance of spirit or of any other deleterious substance having been drunk Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Do I understand you to say that you noticed that the vessels of the brain were spotted with blood A I describe a coagulum on each side internally corresponding with the external wound—there was a general effusion of liquid blood in the base of the brain and all throughout the brain appeared to me to be in a remarkably healthy state unusually so—there was nothing whatever to indicate that the brain was at all diseased there was a vessel decidedly ruptured on each side and probably in other portions—a person falling back upon the floor and striking against a hard substance might produce it without any external mark—I attribute death to the general effusion—the effusion was not much greater at the base of the brain behind—there was a considerable coagulum on each side corresponding with the external bruises about the size of a 5s piece at least in extent—I examined the lungs they were perfectly healthy—there was air in them—I should fancy there would have been less air in them than I saw if any very great violence had been used to the chest—if there had been a great pressure on the lungs there would have been a greater collapse than I saw MR DEARSLEY Q Did you observe the back of the head A I did I did not observe any sign of injury there whatever—if a person had fallen back on the head on the sofa with such violence as to cause concussion of the brain I should certainly have expected to find some external mark MR PARRY Q The effect of concussion of the brain is instantaneous insensibility is it not A Decidedly not COURT Q That would be a question of degree A Yes depending upon the quantity of effusion and the size of the vessel ruptured frequently the appearances do not show themselves for some days after concussion when the vessel ruptured is very small—there may be concussion without the actual rupture of a vessel MR PARRY Q Judging from the blow described the coagulum you noticed within and the rupture of the blood vessel would not the concussion produced by such a blow he almost instantaneous A I should fancy that death would be very quick from such severe blows—but very frequently insensibility would not immediately follow even from such blows as that COURT Q If the woman was in the habit of living rather freely or had been in the course of that day taking a certain amount of spirits and water and porter at night would that increase the tendency to receive injury from a blow A No doubt of it so that a smaller amount of actual violence would occasion the mischief THOMAS WESTLAKE I am a grocer and live at 2 Union-street New Bond-street On the Saturday night 9th Oct about 12 o clock the prisoner came to me for the purpose of getting a doctor—I went for the doctor and Mr Clark attended Cross-examined by MY PARRY Q You were examined I believe both before the Magistrate and the Coroner were you not A Yes when the prisoner came to me he appeared in a very agitated state half mad—I had drank with the poor man at half past 12 o clock on the Saturday night—he hallooed out to me Tom Tom Ann is a dying Mrs Brown is a dying and knocked violently at my door—I have seen the deceased exhibit violence toward several of the servants—I have seen the prisoner with scratches on his face and I think on one occasion with a black eye HENRY BARNES police sergeant C 4 About 2 o clock on Sunday morning 10th Oct I went to the house of the deceased in Shepherd-street—I saw the prisoner there and said to him I understand Mrs Brown is dead he said Yes poor creature she is —I said Very sudden was it not he said Yes —I drew down the sheet of the bed and there saw her dead body—I looked at the marks on the temples and found there were two bruises one on each side—I said to him here are some bruises here—he said Yes I will tell you she was sitting on the hearthrug and she fell over but while she was sitting on the hearthrug she said So help me G—d I will never come into bed with you again alive —I took two constables to the house and said to the prisoner It is necessary that you should come to the station and make that same statement to the inspector —he said Yes I will go —on the way to the station he put himself in different postures showing me how she was sitting and how he lifted her up that he assisted Mary in getting her into bed—he asked me whether that was not natural enough and I said Yes —he made a statement to the acting inspector at the station just similar to what he had told me GUILTY of Manslaughter Aged 26 — Transported for Fifteen Years 
t18530131-293  293 JOHN PARROTT was indicted for the wilful murder of Sarah Parrott MESSRS BODKIN and CLERK conducted the Prosecution JAMES EDE I am a labourer In Dec last I lived at No 6 Spicerstreet—the prisoner lived at No 15 George-street—that is the same house as I lived in—there are two entrances it is a double house one entrance is in George-street and the other in Spicer-street—I knew the prisoner and his wife for about five months—on 7th Dec between 5 o clock and 6 o clock while I was in bed I heard the deceased coming down stairs going into the street—I was sufficiently well acquainted with their voices to know who was speaking—I heard the deceased make use of an awful expression calling after the prisoner a b—y image and Oh you wretch and so forth—between 8 o clock and 9 o clock the same evening I heard groans at the street door—my wife went from our room to the door—the prisoner was not there—my wife said something to the deceased—the prisoner was there then—I heard him ask his wife what was the matter with her—she replied You know best about that —he said Get up stairs with you I will do something to you for this to-morrow —they then went up stairs to their room—they occupied a garret at the top of the house not over my room but at another part of the house—I did not see the deceased again alive Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q You had known the prisoner and his wife about five months A Yes they lived on very unfriendly terms—I have heard their language when they were coming down stairs—I have not heard anything occur in their room because I lived in a different part—I have not frequently heard the deceased abuse and make use of foul language to her husband—I was not in the habit of associating with them—they might quarrel continually without my knowing anything about it—I was not in the habit of going into their room—I do not know that the deceased was run over by a cart in Fleet-street some time ago and brought home ANN MERRITT I am the wife of Joseph Merritt I lived in the same house with the prisoner and deceased in the room immediately under theirs—I have known them living in that room about six months—the prisoner is a jobbing butcher by trade he used to carry meat about the streets—they lived together on very bad terms—I very often heard screams and cries of Murder from the deceased—I remember the day on which she was found dead—between 7 o clock and 8 o clock that morning I was in my own room in bed and heard violent screams from the deceased in their room—she was screaming Murder —the prisoner was in the room at that time—I heard his voice—he was abusing her and swearing—calling her a b—mare and a—blind b— —I think she was partially blind—I got out of bed and went to the foot of the stairs and called out to him You Parrott what are you about with that poor creature —in the confusion I could not catch his answer—he was abusing her—he muttered something which I did not hear distinctly—I then went into my room again and while I was dressing he passed down the stairs and went out—something was said about the police but that was on his return—the screaming ceased while he was out—he returned between 9 o clock and 10 o clock—I was still in my own room—on his going into his room I heard the deceased screaming Murder violently again—I beard his voice swearing as before and I heard a sort of scrambling and lumping noise as though she had fallen—they were scuffling together first and then there was a kind of lumping noise as though she fell—I did not go and call out to him then—I did between 7 o clock and 8 o clock—it was then that I spoke about the police—it was before he went out when she said she was being murdered—I was then standing at the foot of the stairs half undressed—I heard her say that—that was while he was there and I said Oh very well as soon as I get my clothes on I will fetch the police to see what you are about —he replied b—the police —he went out after that and before I was dressed—after the scuffle and fall I flew out of my room to go down stairs but before I could get down he passed down the stairs—that was about ten minutes after I heard the fall—during that ten minutes he was abusing her as before—I went out of my room door and saw him pass down the stairs—I heard no noise or screaming after be had gone out—I did not see the deceased again I was very near my confinement and was not allowed to go into the room Cross-examined Q Did you know these people at all before they came to lodge in that house A No I have heard the deceased name something about being run over in the streets of London and taken home—I do not know it—I do not know that they were in the habit of drinking I never saw them the worse for liquor—they were in very great poverty ELIZABETH BEER I am the wife of Frederick Beer who is landlord of the house No 6 Spicer-street The prisoner and deceased lived at our house for five or six months prior to the deceased s death—they occupied an attic—I remember 8th Dec the day on which the woman was found dead in her room—in the early part of that day I heard great cries of Murder in that room—they proceeded from the prisoner s wife—her name was Sarah Parrott—there was no one but her and her husband in the room at the time—I know he was there because I saw him come down the stairs—I should say the cries continued about half an hoar by what I could hear down stairs—I was in the down stair room—after the cries had gone on for some time I heard the prisoner come down that was about 8 o clock—I did not see him—the lodger in the one pair was abusing him for ill-using his wife—I did not hear him make any answer—I do not know what time he returned I did not see him come in but I saw him go out again about 10 o clock or it might be a little before 10 o clock—he then had a hamper basket with him—before he went out at 10 o clock I had heard screams of Murder a second time—I should say they continued about half an hour again—I did not see or hear anything of the deceased after he went out—the screams did not continue after he went out I never heard a sound of her at all after that—no person went up to the prisoner s room after he went out COURT Q Can you say that nobody did go or only that you do not know of anybody going A I cannot say for certain that they did not but I do not think they did MR CLERK Q Were you at home daring the day A Yes all the day—I saw the prisoner again a little after 5 o clock in the evening when be knocked at my room door and asked me to come up stairs and see what was the matter with his old woman—I went with him to his room and saw the deceased there—she was lying on an old straw mattress in one comer of the garret—I went up to her and felt her she was quite dead—I said My God Mr Parrott she is dead she is stiff and cold you must have done this this morning before you went out —he said Why God bless you woman she spoke to me two minutes ago —I said I am sure it is false for I am sure she has been dead for hours —he said that he had said to her Sally get up and let s have some tea —and that she said I do not know where I am —he said he had only been in about two minutes and had just set light to the fire—I should say from the appearance of the fire that it had been lighted a long while—the coals were bright and quite at the bottom of the stove—I said to him This is the end of your fighting and quarrelling this morning Mr Parrott —he said Why woman you are going mad —the deceased was lying not quite upon her back but very nearly the right leg was quite straight—J remained in the room until the doctor came—the prisoner went for the doctor—he was told several times by different lodgers that came up into the room to go for a doctor but I should say it was about ten minutes before be went off—when I spoke to him about his wife s being dead he made no other observation except that she had spoken to him about two minutes before Cross-examined Q These people were very poor A Very poor—I think the woman was kept very short—they had no furniture in their room nothing at all except the old mattress that old mattress was the only bed they had—I have several lodgers in the house—the deceased was very nearly blind—I do not know anything about her having been run over about a month before her death—while the prisoner was gone for Mr Leech I and one of the lodgers in the first floor remained in the room—neither of us moved the body or attempted to lift it up—I touched her when I first went up but not after that—her eyes were half open and the mouth likewise she was not lying quite on her back but very nearly rather more on the left side her head was leaning towards her chest on the left side—the mattress was about six inches or a foot from the room she was lying crossways upon the mattress no part of her body was lying over the edge of it—there was a piece of patchwork quilt over her—I never heard the deceased say that she was subject to fits and I do not believe she was she was in a good state of health—I think she was a very healthy person except in her sight she was nearly blind she could just discern the light—I never heard her say that she had been either run over or bad fallen down in the street—I never saw them drunk ANN MERRITT re-examined I remained at home in my room from the time the prisoner went out till about 10 o clock when the body was found I was not out at all—I heard no person go up to the deceased s room or any noise whatever in the room after he went out—there is only that one attic REBECCA MARY BEER I am the daughter of Mrs Beer who keeps the house I remember the day on which Mrs Parrott was found dead—about 10 o clock that morning I heard the prisoner go down stairs he went out into the street just before that I had heard Mrs Parrott screaming dreadfully she was hallooing Murder for some time—I heard no noise or screaming after the prisoner went out—I did not see anybody go up stairs to the room after he went out not until the body was found JAMES CHAPMAN policeman H 38 I apprehended the prisoner on 15th Dec in Commercial-street Spitalfields a week after this occurrence took place—I said to him I shall take you into custody fur being the cause of the death of your wife —he said I know nothing at all about it I said I believe your name is John Parrott —he said You will find out quite different to that —I said Well I shall take you into custody and chance it —on our way to the station I said It is no use for you to deny your name you are well known in the neighbourhood in the habit of hawking with oxtails —he then looked at roe very hard and said his name was Parrott it was no use denying it—he said nothing more—this was after the inquest—I said to him It is a had job for you and he answered I have got over all that at the Inquest Cross-examined Q Did you attend the Inquest A I did not SAMUEL FOREST LEECH I am in practice as a surgeon at No 2 Hunt-street Mile-end New-town The prisoner came to my house on 8th Dec between 5 and 6 o clock in the evening—I was at home—he wished me to go and see his wife as she was very ill I asked him what was the matter with her—he said he did not know he thought she was in a fit—I asked him if she was subject to fits—he said yes she had been subject to fits—I asked him if she had spoken to him lately—he said she had about ten minutes before he came for me I asked him what she bad said—he said I asked her to have a cup of tea and her reply was that she did nut know where she was —I then accompanied him to the room and saw the body of his wife—in my judgment she had been dead about three or four hours the body was quite cold—I made no examination of the body then she was partly upon her back with her left leg drawn up and the head bent down on the chest the mouth was partly open the post mortem examination was afterwards made by Dr Godfrey Cross-examined Q You say her mouth was open A Yes and the eyelid was partly lifted—I did not examine the state of the pupil—I saw that she was dead and I wished somebody else to be called in Dr Godfrey saw it the mouth was drawn open about half an inch—I had a candle—I did not observe any lividity about the lips—I made a very superficial examination indeed at that time finding that she was dead—Dr Godfrey examined the body when he came to see whether there were any marks of violence—I was present at the time I never left the room at all—I observed no external marks of violence upon any part of the body I did not myself examine the state of the pupil of the eye I was with Dr Godfrey when he did and held the candle for him while he made the examination as far as that goes I participated in the examination—I did not take any notice of the state of the pupil of the eye nor of the conjunctiva JOHN BLENNERHAST GODFREY ESQ I am a physician and also practise as a surgeon—I reside at No 3 Mount-place near the London Hospital The prisoner came to my house on 8th Dec about 6 o clock—he Said Mr Leech the surgeon has sent me to you wishing you to come my wife is very bad she is dying in fact I believe she is dead —I drove there directly—I got there about a few minutes past 6 o clock—I found Mr Leech in the room—I found the body of the deceased partly lying on a piece of mattress which came to about her hips and her legs were on the floor—the body was almost naked there was a small piece of rug or something like hearthrug or drugget over it that was all the covering she had and it was a very small piece—she was lying with her head bent on the left tide and her body slightly bent to the left side her left leg was drawn up—the chest was bent towards the left side—her arms were lying by her side I am not very distinct about their position it is only to the best of my belief—I stated at the time that in my judgment she had been dead about four or five hours that was only conjecture that is still my opinion the body was cold except over the region of the heart—that was where the covering was—there was warmth there amounting to the natural warmth—the body was rigid—the prisoner was there whilst I was examining the position of the body—I asked him Has this woman had any blows —he said No she has not —I made an examination of the body externally at that time—there was not one mark of external violence about it—there was no suffusion of the conjunctiva the eyes did not protrude they were slightly open there was no red rim or mark round the eyes nor any lividity of the lips—I made a post mortem examination on the Saturday following the 11th— I gave notice to the beadle at once and the Coroner authorised me to open the body it was emaciated to an extraordinary degree there were no scratches or any marks of violence upon any part of the body externally—the stomach was small and contracted the intestines were pale empty and attenuated thinner than usual all the fat which is generally even in cases of disease around the intestines had been absorbed—the longs were out of their natural order the left lung was compressed it was congested and engorged with blood it was full of black venous blood unarterialised blood and there were small congested patches in it as well—when I say congested I mean red patches—the right lung was also engorged and blacker than natural—on the front part of the liver there was a bruised dark patch about the size of the palm of the hand over this patch the peritoneal covering which is a thin caul that covers the liver was disattached from the liver—it was red and there was some appearance of congestion about that portion—on removing the scalp on the left side of the head there was a patch of coagulated blood between the cellular tissue and the bone—it was blood coagulated in the vessels forming a dark patch—I directed Mr Leech s attention to that—and on examining the hair corresponding with that place we found several of the hairs pulled out the roots of the hairs were apparent the hairs were not broken off but pulled out by the roots the hair was there and the roots also—that was to some little extent immediately over the place where the coagulated blood was and other parts near it—I looked at the external skin to see if there was any bruise and also directed Mr Leech s attention to that—there was no bruise—I then examined the interior of the head the brain—the vessels were slightly engorged although in a great number of bodies which I have opened at the hospitals I have not seen the vessels so engorged in the majority of cases yet I have seen cases of natural death where the vessels were as much engorged—the brain itself was healthy in its structure and natural throughout—I examined the heart particularly—the right cavity contained dark blood the left cavity was empty—I rather incline to think that the structure of the heart was more flaccid than usual more weak and attenuated whether that was from the absence of fat or not I cannot say—there was no structural disease in any part of the body Q From all these appearances what in your opinion was the cause of the woman s death A My opinion must be only taken as an opinion and goes for no more than what you yourself would deduce from the facts it only amounts to a probability taking all the circumstances together each of which circumstances may depend upon some other cause totally different from what I say—I merely give my opinion from rational ideas and notions I am anxious that you should not attach to my judgment more value than it deserves—I am of opinion that from the emaciated state of the body the woman was in an extremely weak condition from the roots of the hair being pulled out and the coagulated blood underneath that part I am of opinion that she had received some violence by pulling her hair and from the nature of that coagulated patch and the appearances around it I am of opinion that that took place during life—the congestion and compression of the lungs and the compression of the chest lead me to conjecture that her head had been pulled forward on her chest and that from her weakened state that caused her death by stopping her breathing if her head came in contact with the rug or mattress in her weak and powerless state life would become extinct—there is a disease called idiopathic asphyxia which I have seen persons die of—that is a disease attacking persons from causes from within without any external agent being perceptible to us—it is possible that she might from the state of her heart have had a tendency to idiopathic asphyxia and the pulling her head forward in the manner I have described might have caused an attack of this idiopathic asphyxia and have caused her death it would be different in her case—in the case of a strong person youwould necessarily infer from the congested and compressed state of the lungs that suffocation had taken place that would have been my opinion but looking at the weakened state of this woman her spire and all her muscles being attenuated that which in a strong person would require continued pressure to cause that strangulation and those appearances would in her case be effected in a very short time by a single pull perhaps—it is possible that a slight interruption of the breathing by pulling her forward and her face coming in contact with the cloth or the bed from the weakened state of her system and the heart being flaccid would have caused death in her when it would not in a stronger person with out more continued pressure Q You have stated two facts as to which probably the Jury may require some explanation you say there was no redness round the pupil of the eye and no lividity of the lips what inference do you draw from that A In the majority of cases it is the opinion of the profession that suffocation is generally accompanied by lividity of the lips suffusion of the conjunctiva and general protrusion of the eye Q How does the attenuated state of this woman s body and the feeble condition of her system in your opinion bear upon the absence of those symptoms A That if pulled forward by her hair and her head coming in contact with anything that would be sufficient in the state of her heart to produce this strangulation which it would not in my opinion in a stronger person COURT Q Do you mean to say that you think a woman in her weak condition might be suffocated without causing lividity of the lips or the ordi nary affection of the eye A Yes MR BODKIN Q Looking at the whole circumstances that you have described in your judgment could the death of this woman have occurred from purely natural causes A I do not think it did occur from natural causes COURT Q From the appearances of the body do you think she could have died a natural death A I do not think she could the appearances were not consistent with a natural death but it is possible—if I am confined to the post mortem appearances I say it is possible she could have died a natural death MR BODKIN Q Without any external violence at all A I do not think it is possible that those appearances I have described could have occurred without external violence—the appearances I saw could not have occurred from natural causes finding those appearances I do not think she died a natural death Cross-examined Q I think the period which elapsed between the death of the deceased and the time of your making the post mortem examination was about seventy-two hours was it not A From the 8th to the 11th it was sixty-nine hours after—the morbid appearances which would be exhibited upon a post mortem examination made immediately after death sometimes differ from those presented after an interval of sixty-nine hours Q If you had been called in to make this post mortem examination without having heard anything whatever touching the antecedents of the case would you from that examination have come to the conclusion that the woman had died a violent death A I do not know it is difficult to answer that question because it is mere conjecture—it is possible that I or any man might examine a body and not having our attention particularly directed to any special circumstances we might pass them over—I think the condition of the lungs would not have escaped any medical man accustomed to open bodies—asphxyia was the proximate cause of death that is engorgement and congestion with compression it is possible that congestion of the lungs might be produced either by internal or external causes COURT Q Do you mean the congestion that you observed in this woman or do you mean that congestion of the lungs might take place A The congestion as it was here it is possible to have occurred without external violence I mean from internal causes from natural cause MR SLEIGH Q From the idiopathic asphxyia A Yes I do not think that it could have been produced by any internal disease the result of which was pressure on the trachea I cannot reconcile the possibility of pressure on the trachea—it is possible but I cannot reconcile the probability in my own mind COURT Q Was there any symptom from which you could judge it possible to have arisen from that A No nothing that I observed MR SLEIGH Q At what portion of the body did you commence your incision for the purpose of opening the thorax A On the anterior superior portion of the chest the upper and fourth portion—I examined the organs of respiration and deglutition which are comprised in the larynx and pharynx—after making the external incision to remove the integuments I raised the walls of the chest and then from that I proceeded to examine the bronchia the internal portion of the cells of the lungs from that to the larynx and then the musical box in the throat—I took out both the larynx and pharynx attached to the end of the lungs I took it out attached to the end part of the trachea I could not take it out attached to the fauces—I took it out downwards—I removed the trachea with the bronchial tubes and passed my finger down to see that there was no foreign body in the dura mater—I made an examination of the larynx and pharynx and I looked at the epiglottis particularly—I found no remnants of food in the mouth—I found the epiglottis lying on the rima glottidis in its natural position—I examined the gall bladders there was more bile in them than usual but not any disease—I have met with cases of spasmodic action of the trachea—if death ensued from spasmodic action of the trachea I should not be able on a post mortem examination to detect that any spasm had existed—the appearance of the lungs would be precisely analogous to the symptoms I have been describing Q In point of fact if this woman had died in consequence of a sudden spasm of that description the appearances would have been precisely the same as those which you discovered A It is possible but I do not apprehend that they would—I want to explain—in my opinion if it had been from closure of the rima glottidis or any obstruction of that sort and no pressure had been used the left lung and the right lung would probably have been in the same condition it is an opening common to both lungs Q Then your theory of that pressure on the chest I apprehend is this that the head was pressed down on the chest A The head was found so pressed down and the chest might have been compressed either from the body being pulled over or from some pressure on the left side of the chest—the muscles of the neck and common integuments would not hare exhibited any marks of discolouration if during life the head had been forcibly drawn over on the chest—I saw a case where a man was pressed between a railway carriage and a wall on the Eastern Counties Railway and there were no external marks although the pressure was violent and injured some of the internal organs and this would be the case particularly with a thin woman whose body was very much attenuated—the man I speak of did not die—I give that as a strong case—it is usual if such violence has been exercised to find some indications such as ecchymosis or extravasation on dissecting the common integuments and muscles of the neck—I dissected the common integuments and muscles of the neck of this woman on both sides—I laid back the flaps of the skin on both sides not at the back I examined the skin externally at the back—the muscles of the posterior and lateral portions of the neck arise and are inserted from the base of the cranium to the clavicle and superior spinus processes—the trapezius is the strongest muscle in the neck—I examined those muscles externally but a muscle presents no appearance unless it is ruptured—it is not at all probable that those muscles would have been ruptured if this violence had been exercised I cannot even imagine it possible that the trapezius or any muscle at the back of the neck would have been ruptured Q Are such morbid appearances as were presented upon post mortem examination here frequently manifested in cases of death from natural causes A Such appearances have been manifested at least some of them—you do Dot allude to the pulling out of the roots of the hair of course Q I am confining myself entirely to the internal appearances I am afraid this unfortunate hair has created a prejudice in your mind A Perhaps it has it is impossible to divest one s self of it to a certain extent—the appearance of the lungs was strongly analogous to that which is occasionally presented in cases of natural death but rarely so not frequently it would be an exception—I do not pledge myself as to the actual cause of the death of this woman—the appearance of the lungs in cases of death from starvation is not generally very similar to the appearances presented in this case MR BODKIN Q My friend has asked you whether an interval of sixty or seventy hours might change the appearances upon which the examination proceeds would that be the case here with an attenuated person like this A No it would not—I understood his question to be Do bodies generally change not with reference to this special case—in this particular case I do not think it did because decomposition had not set in Q You have been asked something about spasmodic action of the trachea was there anything at all that indicated an attack of spasm A It is a disease that leaves no post mortem appearances—there was nothing to lead me to the opinion that there had been any attack of spasm in the trachea—idiopathic asphyxia is a disease where a person will suddenly faint off and for some want of power in the action of the heart the blood becomes coagulated or thickened—it is possible that having first met the left lung and impeded respiration the right lung may become gorged afterwards from the exudation of hydrogen or some other cause leaving the left lung compressed—I did not observe externally any appearance of pressure on the left lung—I observed that the chest was bent on the left side and the bones of the sternum depressed on that side as if flattened—I pointed it out to Mr Leech and he also pointed it out to me—I am of opinion that that depression was from some external cause—if a person in a struggle knelt on that part that would account for it Q With respect to idiopathic asphyxia would your opinion of that disease arise in a case where you found the chest depressed the lungs gorged and the head leaning over in the way you have described this woman s head to have been A It would not COURT Q You speak of some coagulated blood under the place where the hair had been apparently pulled out had that anything to do with causing the death A No—I think an attenuated body of this description would get cold sooner than a more robust one—the time in which a body loses heat differs exceedingly—it depends so much upon the surrounding temperature that it is impossible to say I have seen rigidity and coldness of the body arise in two hours I have seen bodies remain warm eight or nine days and I have seen rigidity without coldness come on almost immediately after death—it is uncertain—it may depend upon internal causes the circulation the vital warmth of the body itself the state of heat retained in the flesh and fat and it may depend upon the external temperature—a body exposed to a draught will cool sooner than one not so exposed—there was nothing either in the nature of this body or in the place where it was to make me suppose that warmth would last longer than usual—indeed I should think a very attenuated body in a garret without a fire in the month of Dec and with no clothes on would get cold sooner than in an ordinary case Q If the depression of the bone had taken place from any very recent violence such as kneeling upon it would it have been likely to leave any mark the body being naked or nearly so A It would be likely in the generality of cases I should say but many cases to the contrary have occurred in my own experience and it is laid down as a rule by medical men that great violence may be applied externally without leaving any mark at all and on the other hand the least violence to some bodies will leave a very great mark—the thinness of the body would have something to do with it—cases have occurred of great pressure such as pieces of rock falling upon a body and causing death and upon examination there has not been a single sign of a mark externally while the lung itself has been engorged and compressed—that would be more probable where a large surface was pressing upon it—the knee of a man would not be so likely to leave a mark as a blow nor would a pressure—the general mark is from the vessels being ruptured from a blow in that case it is an ecchymose mark—the least blow will cause a mark sometimes when very great or violent pressure will not do so GUILTY of manslaughter Aged 45 — Transported for Life Before Mr Baron Martin 
t18531024-1107  1107 JAMES HAYES was indicted for the wilful murder of Elizabeth Hayes—he was also charged on the Coroner s Inquisition with the like offence MESSRS RIBTON and GIFFARD conducted the Prosecution MARY ANN RYMELL I am the wife of James Rymell of No 17 Shepherd s-bush-market I know the prisoner by sight and I knew his wife by sight—on Saturday evening 10th Sept last I was at the Stuart s Arms public house between half past 10 and 11 o clock—I saw the prisoner there—I said to him There stands your wife —his wife was close by him—he turned round and said And that will be the last time —I passed on without saying a word to my own home—I believe she was perfectly sober from her appearance—the prisoner did not appear as if he was much in liquor Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q Were you going home at this time A Yes I was not walking rapidly past I was standing there talking to other persons Q What called your attention to Hayes and his wife in particular A I saw him standing there and his wife and I did not think that he saw his wife there and I merely said those words to him and that was how he answered mi—his wife was about five yards from him—I did not know anything of them previously—I did not know upon what terms they were living—I was talking to other persons there—my husband was there—as soon as the prisoner said this I passed on—the words he made use of were not I don t care if it is the last time —he said the words I have told you—I cannot lay when I first told any one about the words he used when he was taken I believe—I was not at the inquest I attended before the Magistrate policeman procured my attendance there—I did not see these persons more than just a moment—I had not a sufficient opportunity to say whether the woman was sober or not—I did not see the prisoner go up to her or see her go up to him and enter into conversation it was the work of a moment MR GIFFARD Q How soon was your attention called to this matter after the Saturday night when did you first hear of it A On the Sunday evening my attention was then called to what I bad seen on the Saturday evening THOMAS TAYLOR I work at the Brickfields I know the prisoner—I have seen his wife I knew her by sight—on Saturday night 10th Sept about half past 11 o clock I was standing with the witness George near the Stuart s Arms—the prisoner and his wife were standing looking in the shop window in Shepherd s-market when I first saw them—I heard the woman ask the prisoner to go home—he up with his fist and knocked her down—the blow was about the body but I could not say whereabouts—she got up and he knocked her down a second time—she then ran behind me and George for protection—I told her to get away as I thought perhaps her husband might think I was harbouring her—I saw him kick at her and he said he would kick her b—brains out and when she was running away be said I will do for you that was when she was running away from behind me—she ran towards Mrs Steele s the Queen s Arms—I did not see anything more of them that night—there were a few people in the market there might be twenty or thirty or perhaps more I cannot say the number exactly Cross-examined Q How long have you known the prisoner A I dare say five years—he is a bricklayer s labourer—there are brickfields in the immediate neighbourhood of Shepherd s-bush—there are not many Irish brickmakers—the brickmakers are generally called brickeys—a great number of persons are employed there in the brickfield—I had not known the deceased for any length of time—I knew her when she used to bring his dinner—that may be two years ago I dare say—I dare say I have known her for two years—I have never seen her in liquor—I only knew her by sight no further than bringing his dinner Q You say she ran behind you and George and you did not protect her why was it that you did not protect her A The Irish and English people are not always on the best of terms and I did not wish to interfere—there were a good many people there COURT Q Then you did not interfere because of the Irish people is that so A Yes MR SLEIGH Q I am afraid it is a very quarrelsome neighbourhood A At times it is—they are not only the brickeys that quarrel but the bricklayers labourers as well—there were a great many Irish labourers among the crowd that was there COURT Q And brickeys also A Yes the brickeys are not Irish—I do not know one that is an Irishman—the labourers are Irish and the brickeys English MR SLEIGH Q How long were Hayes and his wife standing outside this shop before you saw the act of violence committed A Not two minutes—they were both looking into the shop—they were standing close to each other close enough for him to reach her with his fist—they were not both standing together looking into the shop they were both looking but not as if they were on good terms with each other—one was at one end and one at the other about half the distance of the window—it was a bonnet and cap shop not a grocer s—there is a grocer s on this side of it COURT Q How long were they in your sight altogether A Not a quarter of an hour it might have been that at the outside—George was with me all the time EDWARDGEORGE I am a brickmaker I have known the prisoner about five years and his wife about eighteen months or from that to twenty—on Saturday night 10th Sept I was in Shepherd s-bush market with Taylor near the Stuart s Arms—I saw the prisoner and his wife together—I saw him knock his wife down—she got up and he knocked her on to the ground again—she got up a second time and walked behind Taylor and me—we were about six or seven yards from the spot where she was knocked down—the prisoner came behind me and Taylor for his wife and she walked away from us and they went away together Hayes saying that he would kick her b—y brains out—I saw him kick at her but I cannot say whether he kicked her or no it was while he was kicking at her that he said those words—she then went away towards Mrs Steele s—I did not see her go that way but Taylor did—I could not say whether they went away separately or together after he said he would kick her brains out—I saw them again a few minutes after I should say it might be ten minutes walking gently up the market Mrs Hayes before him—he might be fourteen or fifteen yards after her following after her—that was all I saw of them—she appeared perfectly sober that night Cross-examined Q Was it because you were afraid of the Irish people that were there that you did not interfere to protect this woman A No it was not on that account but I did not think any other violence would occur afterwards—this took place in the street—there were about six or seven persons in the street at the time most of them females—they were close to Mrs Hayes—there were several Irish bricklayers standing on the path COURT Q Then what did you mean by saying there were but six or seven persons in the street A Six or seven stood along with me and Taylor—they were mostly females—some of them were Irish—they were standing at a distance from us near the doctor s shop—a few yards off standing round MR SLEIGH Q You have been examined twice have you not before the Coroner and before the Magistrate A Yes—there was a bit of a row in the street that night—I bad not anything to do with it nor had Taylor—Taylor was locked up that night by his wife having her things knocked about—the row in the street was a few minutes before this—Taylor was locked up all night by the police Q Was not the reason why you did not attempt to protect this woman because you were afraid of the people who were engaged in the row A Yes they had not been quarrelling with Mrs Hayes in my sight Q Had not Mrs Hayes been engaged in the row that night and was not that the reason why you were afraid to protect her when her husband struck her for fear of the Irish A Certainly it was COURT Q You say that Mrs Hayes had been in the row A No the reason I was afraid to protect her was for fear of the Irish not because I believed she had been in the row with them—I could not say whether she had been in the row—I did not believe she had MR RIBTON Q At the time you saw the prisoner knock his wife down was there any row A No there was not—the row occurred before that—Taylor was locked up because of his wife s things being knocked out of her lap into the street THOMAS TAYLOR re-examined by MR SLEIGH I was locked up that night—that was some time after this occurrence—the Irish row was in the same street where Hayes struck his wife and a few minutes before it—I never saw Hayes nor yet his wife at the time the row was—it was a good bit after the row to the best of my recollection when I saw Hayes hit his wife—I was not in the row at all—I had nothing to do with it—I was in the street—I did not see it I only heard of it—I was in the street at the same time—I was locked up that night through my wife s things being knocked over on to the pavement—they were knocked over by some drunken men who they were I do not know—I went and interfered with it when I saw them—the police took me into custody because I was there and would not come off until I had picked up my things COURT Q How long was that after you saw Hayes knock his wife down A I should think three quarters of an hour MR RIBTON Q Did you interfere to protect your wife A Yes and to pick up my property what I had bought at the shop—it was grocery—I was taken before the Magistrate on the Monday and they acquitted me directly EMILY SHIRLEY I am the wife of George Shirley of No 3 Back-gardens Shepherd s-bush On Saturday evening 10th Sept I was coming home between 10 and 11 o clock and saw the prisoner in the market—I had known him before—I saw him knock a woman down—she got up again and went down the market—I did not see any more of her then—I stopped with my husband at the top of the maket—about an hour and a half afterwards as I was going home I saw the woman again—that was near 1 o clock about half past 12 o clock I should think it was—it was the same woman I had seen knocked down by the prisoner—she was going round by the Royal Hotel down the island—there is a place called Robinson s-gate at the end of the island—the Royal Hotel and Robinson s-gate are on opposite sides of the road—the island does not run out of the turnpike road it runs alongside the market—the Royal Hotel is at the corner of the island nearer the turnpike road—the island is also called Shepherd s-bush Back-gardens—you go down the island in order to get to Robinson s-gate—when I got past the Royal Hotel the woman and I came together to Robinson s-gate and just past the gate I saw the prisoner standing COURT Q Does the gate lead from the island into the market A It stands in the middle of the island about three parts of the way down—you do not go through it into the market you pass it—it leads into a large carpenter s yard MR GIFFARD Q The yard is at the back of the houses in the market I believe A Yes—when I got up to the gate the prisoner turned round as if he was coming up the island again—the woman turned round to follow him—the woman and I were on the Royal Hotel side of the gate—when the prisoner got about the middle of the gate he stopped and took the woman s head and rammed it against the rails of the gate with both his hands and he said Take that you b—w— I will do for you soon —I then went indoors and saw no more of them—the woman appeared perfectly sober—she had on a plaid shawl and a dark brown bonnet trimmed with plaid ribbon the policeman Searle here produced a bonnet and shawl —these are the same the woman had on—there was a gas light at the corner of the hotel—the woman and I passed that corner together—I did not look at her dress I looked at the bonnet and shawl Cross-examined Q I should like to know a little more particularly about the exact hour at which this occurrence took place A The first time I saw them was between 10 and 11 o clock that was in the market—there were not many persons there at the time it must have been about that time—I am not speaking from what the policeman said afterwards—I had no watch—I am sure it was not between 11 and 12 o clock because it was about twenty minutes past 10 o clock when I was in the grocer s shop getting my things I looked at the clock in the grocer s shop—I was out with my husband he was not with me on the second occasion when I saw the woman I had just left him in the public house—I had been in the public house with him—I was not tipsy I had had some beer nothing else—I did not look at the clock there before I left it was the Royal Hotel—I had been in there about an hour—I went straight home after this occurrence it was close to my own house—it was while I was walking with the woman that Hayes appeared in sight standing against Robinson s-gate—she went up to him he walked away and she followed him—he had got about half the length of this court before he laid hold of her head—I could not hear anything pass between them before he did that—I did not hear any word spoken at all till I saw him take bold of her—I had never seen the woman before that night—I have not seen the body of the deceased—I did not see her next morning while she was alive—except from the bonnet and shawl I have no means of saying who she was—to the best of my belief this bonnet and shawl were on that woman that night I have no other means of knowing that it was the prisoner s wife—it was a very dark night and very foggy—the place against which he pushed the woman s head was wood—they were flat rails—he pushed the woman against them with very considerable force as hard as he could several times—I should think it could not but have injured her head—I could see the prisoner s features—I was not fifty yards from the gas light—there is a sweep s in the middle and their lamp was alight—when I saw him he was about three parts of the way down the island—he was about as far from the gas light as I am from the wall of the court—there were no other people about—there were a great number of men and women in the hotel where I left my husband—the men were brickeys—after Hayes inflicted the violence on the woman she walked up the island went in doors and I saw no more of her—that was after her head had been pushed against the rails—that was the last I saw of her—I do not know what became of the man—I went into my own house MR GIFFARD Q What time does the public house close on a Saturday night A Twelve o clock—it had not closed when I left it—I was out buying grocery that night between 10 and 11 o clock and I had the grocery with me when I was going back through the island and saw the prisoner knock the woman down—I was taking it home and except during the time I was taking it home I was with my husband all the evening—there was about half an hour between my leaving the Royal Hotel and the time I saw this transaction take place—I left my husband in the public house and when I returned the public house was closed—I saw this matter happen as I was returning from the public house the last time—the sweep s gas light is nearly opposite Robinson s-gate—the road is just wide enough for a horse and cart to go down—when the prisoner did what I have described he was just across the road just opposite the gate —I knew him before I have no doubt he is the roan COURT Q When they close the public house do they turn the people out or do they let them stay A They all go out JOHN SEARLE policeman T 69 My beat is at Shepherd s-bush in the parish of Hammersmith On Sunday evening 11th Sept I was on duty at the top of Shepherd s-bush market near the Royal Hotel about 20 minutes past 1 o clock—there are some unfinished buildings at the other side of the turnpike-road—I heard a scrambling across the road—I could not see as it was very foggy and thinking that it was a brother constable I crossed over—there are some railings which separate the ground where the buildings are from the road—I waited about two minutes heard no further sound and then stooped under the railings—I walked ten or twelve yards further on the building ground with my light turned on listened for a moment but did not hear any thing—when I had gone about twenty-eight yards inside the railings I saw the prisoner standing in front of me—it was a very dense fog and I could not see two yards from me—I was standing close to the prisoner when I saw him—I asked him what he did there—he said What the b—h—is that to do with you —he appeared in a very trembling state—he appeared stupefied and I thought he was under the influence of drink—I told him he had better follow me into the road thinking he had lost himself and I went three or four yards thinking he was following me but he did not—I went back again and found him nearly in the same spot but about six yards nearer to the spot where the deceased was afterwards found—I requested him to come away and told him if he did not choose to do so I should be compelled to take him up—he said it was all right he had stepped off the road it being foggy and bad lost himself—he remained in the position in which he was two or three minutes and then unbuttoned his trowsers and gazed on the spot which has since been pointed out to me—I turned myself round and stood by the side of him for about a couple of minutes and then told him again if he did not follow me I should be compelled to lock him up as he had no business there whatever—he followed me into the road after stooping under the rail and then said to me u I thought I knew you —I said You don t know roe and I don t know you by that means go away —his reply was If you don t know roe J wonder at your speaking to such a character as I am —after that he went away and I followed him to Norland turnpike-gate about twenty yards from there in the direction of Shepherd s-bush that was all I saw of him that night—I then went back to the spot we had come out from and remained there some time but he did not return as 1 thought he might Cross-examined Q This place is separated from the the road by a railing which runs parallel with the road A Yes there is a footpath before you get to the railing—the place is an excavation for building—perhaps there are three houses built—the excavation is for foundations—when you get under the rails you pass three houses in shell first which is twenty-eight or thirty yards and then you can descend a little into the excavation—there is a slope there but very little—I did not go down I descended a little—the excavation adjoins the houses and the rail is to prevent people from going in but there are from twenty-eight to thirty yards to go before they would fall into the excavation—they are wooden rails—I got under them—it is very nearly half the distance more than the length of this Court from the road to the excavation—the railing does not go in a line with the houses which are in shell—the houses turn off from the road—the rail does not go to the excavation bat it prevents persons from walking off the road into the excavation—it extends the whole of the way along the road with the excep tion of about three feet at each end—the whole of it is about sixty yards—in the excavation just under the perpendicular wall which forms the cellars there are two or three brickbats—the excavation has been there about two years or it might be rather more I cannot say exactly—the perpendicular wall on side forming the cellars is about five feet from the surface to the bottom and right under there is where the brickbats are—the man whom I saw that night 1 say is the prisoner—I might have seen him before—I did not know him by sight—I did not see him again till he was in custody that was on Sunday evening—on the night in question he walked very well—he was not very much intoxicated—I thought he was labouring under the influence of drink—he appeared stupefied trembling and sighing very much—the night was so foggy I could not see two yards before me—it had been so for two hours before MR RIBTON Q How many carcasses of houses are there built A Three—the corner house faces the road the other houses do not—there is to be a road formed-there—the corner house is about ten yards from the road across the foot path and all but from the railing it is not above five or six yards—the ground behind the other houses presents nearly the same surface as the road—the road is not formed yet—I have no doubt whatever the prisoner is the man—I was in his company five minutes at the least and I took particular notice of him—I saw him in custody on the next Sunday night and identified him—I attributed his being in that trembling and sighing state to the influence of drink but he walked away very well without staggering and he spoke very well to me with the exception of sighing COURT Q When you saw the prisoner on Sunday night at the station house did you see him singly or was he with other persons t A He was with one other prisoner a man thirty or thirty-five years of age—the prisoner was lying on his back with his hands behind his head—I was not aware at the time that he was in custody RICHARD KENNETT I am carter to William Scott and live at No 10 Clifton-street On Sunday morning 11th Sept I was going to my work at a few minutes past 6 o clock and in consequence of something I heard I went into the building ground and found a woman lying down in the excavation which is about nearly as far again from the railing as I am from the wall of this Court—she was lying on her stomach and face and her shawl was turned over her head—she had a bonnet on—the shawl was not muffled round her head—I pulled her over on her back and unpinned her bonnet strings—she was alive but senseless—her right eye was very much blackened and also the corner of her mouth—the eye was swollen—when I pulled her over she vomited—she appeared to have been nearly strangled—I asked some men who were standing by if they would fetch a policeman Cross-examined Q Was not her shawl pinned round her neck A It was pinned a little distance off her neck but it had got pushed up and somehow or other it was turned over her head COURT Q Did you observe whether the vomiting smelt of liquor A I did not take notice JAMES STARLING On Sunday morning 11th Sept I was going on duty at Shepherd s Bush and in consequence of something I heard I went to these buildings and found a woman lying on her side vomiting—she appeared to be insensible—it was then about a quarter past 6 o clock—I did not see Kennett there—her right eye was very much swelled and her right jaw—I had her taken on a stretcher to the station and I went for a doctor—on Sunday evening the 11th about 7 o clock I assisted Rogers another constable in apprehending the prisoner—he asked Rogers what he wanted him for—Rogers told him it was respecting his wife—he said if his wife liked to get drunk and knock herself about with a brick he could not help it—I pointed out to Searle the spot where I found the woman—it was at the end of some unfinished buildings opposite to the Royal Hotel outside the buildings in the excavation—her head was about twelve or thirteen feet from the perpendicular part of the brick work—from the surface to the bottom of the excavation is about five feet deep Cross-examined Q Was she lying on her right side when you found her A Yes to the best of my recollection—the prisoner s words were If my wife likes to get drunk which she will do and knock herself about with a brick I cannot help it —he did not say If my wife likes to get drunk as she will do and allow herself to be knocked by brickeys I cannot help it HENRY ROGERS policeman T 13 On Sunday 11th Sept I apprehended the prisoner at the Norland Arms public house Notting-hill—he asked me what I wanted with him—I told him it was respecting his wife—he asked me if she was dead and I told him yes—he said If she likes to get drunk and knock herself about with a brick that has nothing to do with me —he said he had not seen her since 9 o clock the night before—that would be Saturday Cross-examined Q You know what the meaning of the word brickeys is in that neighbourhood A Yes brick makers—the prisoner did not say If she likes to get drunk and allow herself to be knocked about by brickeys —I adhere to my original statement that he said with a brick EDMUND LINES I am a labourer I knew the deceased I married her sister—on Sunday 11th Sept in consequence of something I heard I went to the prisoner about 3 o clock and saw him standing against the Queen s Arms—I asked him if he bad heard anything about his wife—he said I heard a little about it but thank God I did not do it —I told him she was at the station house very bad and that nobody would be let to see her only her sister or husband—I met him again about an hour afterwards and he asked me if she was dead—I said No I have not been at home since —I said I had been at another place—he said u Success to the be brickeys that done her at last I would not wish to hurt a hair of her head —he has not been living with her for about two years and when they lived together they lived in Earl-street Cross-examined Q When had you seen the deceased previously A I saw her on the Saturday evening we had a little to drink in a public house—William Linch and Michael Hayes were there—Linch is a neighbour of mine—the deceased did not go into the public house with us—she was standing outside the door when I met her talking to her husband and Michael Hayes—it was then about 6 o clock by the public house o clock—this was the Prince of Wales public house which is about a quarter of a mile from the Royal Hotel—I was not in the Prince of Wales five minutes—I went away leaving the deceased her husband and Michael Hayes standing at the bar—during the five minutes that I was there I ordered half a pint of gin—the deceased drank part of it—Linch then ordered another half pint of gin—the deceased took the decanter and poured out the first half pint into glasses—I ordered that but Linch paid for it—that was soon disposed of and then I ordered another half pint and paid for it—I do not know whether the deceased partook of the second half pint—the first half pint was taken between the four of us—the prisoner drank a portion of it—the four persons were the deceased the prisoner Michael Hayes and myself—the deceased poured out the second half pint as she had done the first and I left her in the public house with the other two persons—Linch is a bricklayers labourer and I believe Michael Hayes is a labourer too—I do not know whether he is a relation of the prisoner—I never knew him before that night—the deceased and her husband appeared on very good terms—there was not the slightest quarrel between them MR RIBTON Q You say four persons shared in the first half pint A Yes and I believe the same persons shared in the second but there is a regular thoroughfare through the public house and I think the deceased gave two women a share of it—Linch had not a share of it—he did not drink any—I was not there above five minutes JOHANNAH LINES I am the wife of the last witness and the sister of the deceased On Sunday 11th Sept a policeman came and fetched me to the station—I saw my sister there in a very bad state—I scarcely knew her—she was knocked about bruised and disfigured and had a black eye—she was not sensible—she was removed from the station to my house at 5 o clock in the afternoon and I continued to attend her till her death which was at a quarter to 6 o clock on Sunday afternoon—she never spoke—this is her bonnet and shawl produced —I have seen her wear them—the wore them in my own house on the Wednesday before the murder happened JAMES STARLING re-examined This is the bonnet and shawl that I found on the woman JOHN BROWN I am a surgeon On Sunday morning 11th Sept at 7 o clock I was sent for to the station house and found a female very ill totally insensible—she was very much bruised about the face—her right eye was swollen very much from a blow and was very livid—there was also a severe bruise on the lower jaw—the left side of her face was as if she bad been struck with some gravel as if it had been sliped down with gravel—by sliped down I mean that it was as if she had been dragged over some gravel—I saw her again at 10 o clock—she was then in a more sinking state and totally insensible—5 o clock was the last time I saw her alive—on the Monday week afterwards I made a post mortem examination—on opening the head there was a great effusion of blood on the substance of the brain underneath the second covering and also in both ventricles of the brain—there was about two drachms in one ventricle and a few ounces in the other—the other organs of the body were generally healthy except the heart which was very flabby and had thin walls—I have no doubt that death was caused by the quantity of blood effused on and in the ventricles of the brain—a blow or blows would be likely to produce that Cross-examined Q I understand you to say that the immediate cause of the death of the deceased was the effusion of blood on and in the brain A It would gradually produce death—I attribute death to that state of the parts which I discovered—I say decidedly that that effusion of blood may have been caused by a blow or blows—a fall might do it too—it must be a very great degree of excitement indeed to do it—I never met with a case in which it has been done by a high degree of intoxication—in that case it is doubtful if you would have blood in the ventricles—I think you would not but you would if the concussion was caused by a blow or a fall—I made a careful post mortem examination particularly of the brain—I made an incision into the brain— the small vessels which ramify the brain were not in a congested state—the substance of the brain was free from any effusion Q If a body is examined a day or two after death do not you find that part which is next to the substance on which it was lying gorgedswith blood A The skin is a portion of the blood follows the laws of gravitation and goes to the lowest part—it would depend on the state of the weather whether I should find structural change in a body after the lapse of a week after death—in the present case I think it made no difference—I should prefer making the examination within two days of course—I examined the meningeal artery—it was in a sound state—no portion of the brain was lacerated—the chief source of effusion of blood in cases of fulness in the brain is not caused at all times by a rupture of the meningeal artery Q Is this statement correct of Professor Taylor The chief source of the effusion of blood to the head arises from a rupture of the meningeal artery and this may occur from the mere shock or concussion with or without a fracture of its bony canal A I believe it is concussion of the brain and effusion of blood may be occasioned in the brain without any marks of external violence—the most severe bruises I discovered were on the right eye and the right jaw—what I have stated was that there was great effusion on not in the substance of the brain Q Do you coincide with this remark of Professor Taylor When the marks of violence are slight a witness must exercise great caution before be alleges that the extravasation was produced by a blow especially when it ii found that the deceased was of intemperate habits A Yes I consider that is correct scientifically speaking Q Can you give your assent to this If a man excited by passion and intoxication is struck on the head and the blow is very slight such as an unaffected person would have sustained without injury yet if insensibility and death follow and on examination a quantity of blood is found extravasated in the substance of the brain can it be a matter of doubt with the practitioner that the extravasation was chiefly due to the excitement under which the deceased was labouring A I should think that would be the case generally speaking—I think a blow on the eye to produce the effect which was produced would be quite sufficient to cause effusion of blood into the brain—it must knock a person down Q In the case of a person falling in a state of intoxication and being previously much excited might not concussion and effusion have been the result independently of any blow A I should rather doubt it myself—if a person fell a distance of four or five feet having been previously drinking and in an excited state I think there would be external marks to corroborate it—I have known cases of concussion and effusion and death supervening without any external mark—I have even known fracture of the skull without external marks COURT Q You say supposing a person to fall five or six feet who was in a state of excitement from liquor that the mere fall would not account for it A Not for the quantity of blood which I found in the ventricles MR SLEIGH Q Do you dissent from this opinion of Dr Taylor that extravasation may occur from violence with or without fracture and it may take place without any external marks of injury to the head A Extravasation might but that would be in a different place—this was in the ventricles as well MR RIBTON Q You said the small vessels which ramify through the brain were not in a congested state if the person had been in a drunken state would they have been congested A I should think they would have been fuller than they were—I saw the woman at 7 o clock on Sunday morning—she did not vomit at the station but there was some food just inside her mouth—I am not able to say whether she had or had not been drinking MR SLEIGH Q You examined the heart and you say that the walls of it were flabby do you mean the auricles or the ventricles A The ventricles—they were thinner COURT Q Do I understand you to say there were or were not any appearances which enabled you to connect the effusion of blood with the appearance of any external bruise A Not any—I think the external bruise must have been caused by a blow because there were no scratches or anything of that kind—the skin was not abraded—I have seen the excavation and I do not think that the appearances which I found and which caused death could be accounted for by the woman falling down there—I think if she had fallen on her head there must have been some external bruise and I do not think the shock would be sufficient to cause those appearances supposing she was in a state of excitement unless she did fall on her head I have a confident opinion of that nor could it be produced by her falling on any other part of her body—if she had fallen on brickbats at the bottom of the excavation that would not be reconcilable with the appearances I found on her eye because the skin would have been cut by the sharp edge—I opened the head first and under the scalp above the right eye I found a small mark—it was on the temple and was as if she had fallen on a small piece of brick or gravel which was not sufficiently large to cut through the skin but to mark it underneath—the mortal appearances could not have arisen from that at all JURY Q Were there any bruises on the back of the head A None at all nor on any other part of the body except what I have mentioned JOHN KNIGHT I am a grocer of Shepherd s-bush-marker On the Saturday evening of this occurrence the prisoner and his wife came into my shop—I did not know them before but I recognised the body of the deceased at Hammersmith—it was about a Quarter or twenty minutes after 12 o clock—the prisoner bad some grocery goods but I was otherwise engaged and cannot tell what they were—the woman appeared perfectly sober—the prisoner ordered the goods but I did not serve him myself Cross-examined Q Did they appear to be on perfectly good terms A I never heard anything particular about it MR RIBTON Q Was it the next day that you saw the body of the woman A No it was on the Monday—I can say that that was the Woman who I had seen in my shop with the prisoner on the Saturday night—I saw the body at a house at the back of the station—the policeman Searle took me there to see it JOHN SEARLE re-examined The body that the witness Knight saw in my presence was that of the deceased it was at No 23 Brook Green-place GUILTY of manslaughter —Aged 39 — Transported for life 
t18540703-842  842 MARY ANN ALICE SEAGO was indicted for the wilful murder of William Seago she was also charged on the Coroner s Inquisition with the like offence MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution ANN COOPER SEAGO This witness was examined by MR JUSTICE CRESSWELL as to the state of her religious knowledge and was then sworn —I am nine years old last month the prisoner is my mother she is not my first mother—she married my father I do not know how long ago—I had a little brother named William—I do not know how old he was I remember his dying—I have a brother named Tommy—he is not my first mother s child he is the prisoner s boy—I recollect when my mother came home that Tommy said O mother Billy has got me into such a row —mother said What is it —Billy was sitting on a box his feet touched the ground when he sat on it—mother knocked him off the box and then he went to bed—he then got up again out of bed no one had told him to do so—he had gone to bed with his clothes on—mother strapped him and then she put him in the water and washed him with his clothes on and then Tommy took him out of the water and wiped him and undressed him and put him to bed—mother put him into the water twice—I am sure I do not know whether he had his clothes on the second time I think he had not—the first time he was in the water mother hit him several times with her hand—he could not get out of the water by himself because he had not strength he could not hardly move—after my brother wiped him and put him to bed mother told him to get up and rub the tea-tray he did that but did not rub it long he seemed to be weak—after he had rubbed it a little while father knocked at the door and mother told Billy to go to bed—then she said Go down and let the b—in I went dawn and let him in and father came up stairs and said What has happened mother did not speak—father said I will go out of this and mother said Go and take your b—y children with you —father then went out he did not stop a minute—Billy sat up in bed while father was there and then mother pulled him out and threw him across the room on to a chair—his head was hanging down then—I think he was on the floor when she took him up—she threw him across the room twice and his forehead went against a large tin box that was not the box he had been sitting on—mother then kicked him several times and Tommy said O mother don t beat Billy any more you will kill him and you will be hung —mother was then going to throw the pepper castor at Tommy for saying so—I said to Billy Get up and let me wash you he did not get up he was not able—he was lying on the floor with his face all over blood which came from his nose and forehead he was dead then—the first thing mother said when he was dead was O my dear Billy I do love you O my God what have I done —she sent for some brandy and tried to give Billy some but he was not able to swallow it—when she found he could not swallow it she said to me Don t say anything or I shall be hung she then wrapped him up and took him to the hospital Cross-examined by MR PARY Q What are you called at home A Annie—Tommy was bigger than me but I do not know whether he was older—he complained of Billy getting him into a row—they had been out together all the morning and Tommy had hit Billy and father had hit Tommy—I have been taught to say my prayers—they have taught me at the workhouse—my second mother has not taught me or prayed with me at any time—I did not know any prayers before—my father had not been at home all this day—while all this was going on in the room some bacon and eggs were being cooked for tea—there was not enough for all of us I am quite sure of that—mother had brought the bacon and eggs in—the water was boiling to make the tea and the tea things were laid—mother had come home first and then gone out again to buy the bacon and eggs—that was before this happened—what Tommy said was Oh mother Billy has got me into such a row and father has hit me —my father came in while Billy was in bed—he did not stay at all—I have told you the truth here today—I have not said anything against my second mother that is not true—I always tell the truth and never tell any stories—I have sometimes been scolded for telling stories—sometimes by my father I think COURT Q You have sometimes told him what is not true A I have sometimes said what I ought not to have said MR PARRY Q You have said something that never happened have not you A Yes—I have got an aunt Mary—I forget whether I ever said anything about my father and aunt that was naughty and wrong I am quite sure I forget—the complaint of my telling stories has been made often—I have sometimes been a naughty little girl and told stories MR PAYNE Q Have you told us any stories to day A No—it was the beating that made Billy s forehead bleed—I did not notice any particular blow on the forehead that made it bleed—it was before he went against the box that I saw his forehead bleeding—it was not his nose but his forehead ERNEST HENMAN I am a tailor and live in York-street Mile-end The prisoner had been lodging at my house a twelvemonth when this happened—I do not remember her marriage with Seago—it was about three weeks previous to her coming to lodge with me—she was married when she came—there were no children by the second marriage—on Sunday 21st May I heard her come home after 4 o clock in the afternoon—soon after she came in I heard something fall and I heard a child commence crying—it was Billy—I knew the children s voices—I have been given to understand that he was about five years old—the noise continued a short time—I cannot exactly say when it left off the first time—I remember the father coming home—after he had gone out again I heard the noise of a child but it was a much fainter noise than before—after it ceased I happened to go through the passage and heard the prisoner crying and lamenting—she said My darling boy what have I done why should I put myself into a passion with the children —I remember the little girl going up stairs after her father had gone out—after that I heard talking and the child crying and a rumbling noise on the floor Cross-examined Q Did you hear the brandy sent for A I saw the little boy bring in the brandy—I heard the prisoner say My God What have I done my darling boy Q Did she appear to be addressing the child My darling boy Billy speak A I was in the room underneath but I should expect it was the child she was addressing—she said What shall I do why should I ill use my children —her husband is a bricklayer—I am not aware whether he was in straitened circumstances he lost time when it was bad weather—they always paid their rent—the prisoner has borrowed money of me for the purpose of buying food for the children and I have seen food bought with the money on several occasions that was a twelvemonth ago—it is nearly twelvemonths ago since she borrowed money of me—I have not known her buy food since then out of her own money because I have not been in her room—I think she was the worse for drink on this day because she never made a noise when sober she was very quiet when sober—she worked for my mistress once in the tailoring line and I heard her say since that time that she has made shirts—she had four children of her own besides Annie and Billy who were her husband s children—they did not all live together two of them Tommy and Emanuel a lad of fourteen lived out MR PAYNE Q Had there been another child a brother of the little girl Annie A Yes there were three by the first wife but one of them died—I heard voices in the room on this day but could not hear a word that was said HARRIET HENMAN I am the wife of the last witness I was at home the day the child Billy died—I heard the prisoner come home—she went up stairs and then I heard thumps on the floor and which sounded like slaps with a strap as there was a space between each and then I heard the child Billy cry and heard Tommy say Don t mother don t mother I —I heard something frying and I heard Mrs Seago as if she was eating and she was swearing at the same time—the only words I heard were b—y and b—r and then I heard slaps and thumps on the ground repeated as before then Tommy said again Don t mother don t mother —then there was a knock at the door it was repeated and then I heard Mrs Cooper say Go down and let the b—r in and the little girl did so— the prisoner always went by the name of Cooper —her husband came in and went up stairs and the little girl went into the yard and I saw bruises on her face—she met her father at the foot of the stairs as he was coming down and I heard him speak to her—I afterwards heard the prisoner say to her Where were you when your father was in the house —she said she was in the yard—Mrs Seago said It is a lie the b—y serf in the shape of a man —I then went into the back yard—I was going into the other room to put my things on to go to chapel and heard the prisoner say My God what have I done why should I put myself in a passion and ill use the children O my God give me strength to go through it —before I heard those words I heard a faint noise in the room the same as before but not so much as before—I met Tommy in the passage with the brandy he went up stairs and I heard him cry and his mother cry and just afterwards she went out of the house—I looked out of the window and saw her pass with the child in her arms with something over it—she said the child was convulsed and had got the rattle in its throat but I did not speak to her—she went towards the hospital Cross-examined Q Did you see whether she was tipsy A She appeared by her violence to be tipsy and as she passed the window she looked very strange as though she had been tipsy and was frightened—she was very often tipsy and her husband also—they used to quarrel and fight very much when they were tipsy—I have seen her with black eyes—her husband had been there that day—they went out in the morning as they commonly did on Sunday mornings—they came home again and he went out about 3 o clock as near as I can guess—it was past 6 o clock when this happened—the prisoner has not borrowed money of me frequently—I have not been on intimate terms with her since last July not to associate with her—I used to shun her for her swearing was so awful WILLIAM WATSON police sergeant K 38 I took the prisoner at her place about half-past 10 o clock on the Sunday night—she was drinking a cup of tea—I said I had come about the child that was taken to the hospital that it was a very bad job and she must go with me to the station—she said she would go but she would show me how it was done that there was a large box about a foot and a half high which she showed me and that there was a small wooden tub standing close to the tin box which was about a foot and a half high that she was washing Billy in that tub and he fell forward with his forehead on the tin box—I said she must accompany me to the station—she said would I allow her to have another cup of tea I said I would and she poured out another cup and drank it and then I took her to the station—going along she asked who charged her I said I shall charge you at the station on suspicion of causing the death of the child —she said that it was a dear boy to her she loved it dearly that it was in a consumption or was consumptive and that it had been very weakly for some time—I afterwards went to the room and brought away the dress which she wore it was smeared with blood—I examined the room and saw blood on the floor and on the wall on the side where the tin box and tub were but five or six feet from the tin box—that blood could not have come from the tin box it was farther away ANN RANDALL I am female searcher at the station I searched the prisoner on Sunday evening 21st May—I saw some blood on the bosom of her chemise—I asked her how it came there she said it was blood that came from her dear Billy—she said It soaked through my dress I have not the same dress on now —she said she was washing Billy in salt and water and his arms were round her neck that he fell like death and fell on to the tin box—she said he was consumptive and had a diseased heart MAJOR GREENWOOD I was house surgeon at the London Hospital I recollect the child being brought there by the prisoner I saw it directly—it was dead— it was as near as possible 6 o clock in the afternoon —it had a horizontal wound about two and a half inches long and three quarters of an inch wide directly across the forehead the bone was exposed by the wound—there was also a severe contusion on the head about two inches above the ear the upper lip was much contused and swollen and there were bruises about the face and the body generally but not serious ones and various scratches—I made a post mortem examination on removing the scalp I found contusions almost all over the head both the sides and the posterior part—on removing the skull cap I found extensive extravasation and blood on the surface and in the membranes of the brain particularly on the left side and about an ounce of blood effused on the posterior part immediately behind the head—the ventricles of the brain were full of bloody serum but in other respects the brain was healthy and the other organs of the body were generally healthy the heart was quite healthy—some of the mesenteric glands were enlarged and the liver was enlarged—I attribute death to concussion of the brain with extravasation of blood—they were such injuries as would be produced by a child being thrown on the floor or against anything Cross-examined Q Was the wound on the forehead the principal cause of death A No it was of secondary importance—it went directly across the forehead and had completely torn the flesh—this wound contributed but slightly to cause death there was no extravasation corresponding to it on the brain GUILTY of Manslaughter Aged 30 — Transported for Life 
t18550702-699  699 JEREMIAH FOLEY was indicted for the wilful murder of Hannah Bell alias Robinson he was also charged on the Coroner s Inquisition with the like offence MR RYLAND conducted the Prosecution MARY MACAULAY I am an unfortunate girl I knew the deceased Hannah Bell for about two months—I lodged in the same house with her for three weeks at No 2 Five Bell-alley Limehouse it is a bad house—on Monday evening 11th June I went to that house with two men between 5 and 6 o clock—the deceased was at home—she kept company with one of the men down stairs and I went up stairs with the others—I was talking to the man just inside the room door when the prisoner followed me up took hold of the man and threw him down stairs and cut his mouth—I do not think I had ever seen the prisoner before that day—I do not think he was very drunk he did not seem to be drunk he was able to beat us very well—after he had thrown the man down stairs he commenced beating him I begged of him not to kill the man and he caught hold of the hair of my head threw me down and began to kick me—the deceased came to my assistance we were then down stairs I had come down after the man she endeavoured to prevent the prisoner from ill using me and he took hold of her two arms and struck her with his fist on the breast or stomach I do not know which she fell from that blow—I believe she fell down side-ways I do not think she fell partly on her knees—he then lifted his foot as if to kick her I do not know that he did kick her—I then left the room went outside the door and the prisoner followed me took me by the hair of my head pulled me down and commenced jumping upon me before the door—I was saved from him and went in doors and he then went away—in a very short time the deceased came into my room—she then had a big lump on her jaw—Mrs Slaughter who lives in the same court came in with her she was struggling to walk she walked with difficulty—when she came in she got faint and fell back on the boards—she told Mrs Slaughter to bring her some vinegar—she fainted—Mrs Slaughter and I laid her on the bed and she got some vinegar and bathed her head—T did not hear her speak any more—I laid down on the bed with her—I was not long on the bed before Mrs Slaughter came back and told me that the prisoner was coming back I then went out—I think that was between 8 and 9 o clock—I left the deceased on the bed in a faint—I came back at a quarter past 12 o clock—I went in with a policeman and found the deceased dead on the bed Cross-eaxmined by MR SLEIGH Q She was not a very sober woman was she A She was not but she had no drink whatever that day—I had been with her the whole day—she used to drink a good deal—when the prisoner first struck her I do not know whether she fell on her face and hands or on her side she fell between the table and the bed—I am not sure whether she fell on her face and hands I think she did—when she came back into the room she was in a fainting condition—she fell down on the floor violently on her back and I and Mrs Slaughter lifted her up and put her on the bed—I had not been drinking nor had she for she had no money—I paid her rent to the landlady that morning RACHEL SLAUGHTER I am the wife of George Slaughter and live at No 2 Five Bell-alley not at the same No 2 as the deceased lived but three doors off I was at home on Monday evening 11th June between 5 and 6 o clock and heard screams from the other No 2—I went there the door was shut I pushed it open and went in—I found the prisoner there in the lower room and saw him strike the deceased in the chest—it did not seem to have the least effect—she fell down on her knees—Macaulay was not present then—the prisoner was beating her out of the alley at the same time—the deceased s head and face did not touch the floor—she then went into my house—she was able to walk by herself—she remained in my house I dare my nearly an hour she was sitting on the step of my door and the prisoner came back and gave her two kicks one on the left side of her face and one on the jaw—they were very hard kicks—I did not notice what sort of shoes he had on—she went in and sat in my chair—I afterwards saw her to her lodging—she told me to go and get her some vinegar which I did and bathed her—as near as I can guess it was about 8 o clock when I left her she seemed rather faint then—I went back about 9 o clock or between 9 and 10 she then seemed as if she was asleep she said to me God bless you and God will bless you that was after I had bathed her face—I remained till the prisoner came in again that was about 10 o clock or a little after—he was drunk at first but he was pretty sober when he came in the second time he was quite aware what he was doing at first—he said nothing when he kicked her the second time—he said You b——w—— I mean to have your life —that was when he gave her the blow in the stomach on the first occasion—he was not to say over tipsy when he said that he knew what he was doing—I did not know of any quarrel between them that night or at any other time I believe she was always afraid of him by what I heard—she did not keep company with him—I did not remain with her till she died—I went in about 12 o clock and then she was dead—the prisoner was in the place by himself Cross-examined Q Was it when you went in after hearing the screams that you heard the prisoner make use of the language you have told us A Yes—at that time Macaulay was there they were all three struggling together JOHN ROBINSON I am an engineer and reside at Limehouse I knew the deceased—on Monday evening 11th June I was passing through Five Bell-alley about a quarter or half past 6 o clock and saw the prisoner beating the deceased up against the wall about three or four yards from her own door—he had got hold of her by the top part of her dress behind with his left hand and was beating her with his right hand over the back part of her head and neck her hair was all hanging down disordered and her cap too—from the time I first saw them till I got out of the alley I saw him strike her seven times—I did not interfere—I spoke to one of the neighbours at the next house I do not know his name but he is an Irishman and he said You had better get away for the safety of your own life if he rips you open with a knife who is to give you redress —he advised me to go away and let them alone and I did so—it seemed all quiet there was nobody about in the alley—I had known the deceased about three years and a half—she did not keep company with the prisoner to my knowledge—he did not lodge in the alley at that time he did about eighteen months ago— he was not acquainted with her to my knowledge—about 8 o clock I was passing through the alley again and saw the deceased sitting on the step of Mrs Slaughter s door with her elbows on her knees and her hands up to her head—I said to her Halloo mother how do you feel now —she used to go by the name of Mother Robinson in the alley—I heard Bay that she was about thirty-six years old—she said I feel very bad my head is very bad I think I am dying Cross-excamined Q I suppose the reason why you did not interfere was because these squabbles are not very uncommon there A That is quite right—there is often a bit of a row there they generally have a row in the summer time—I have passed through the alley for nearly four yean and I never saw anything wrong they never interfered with me—I am positive that the deceased said her head was very bad when she was sitting at the door step—this is not the first time I have said so I said so at the Thames Police Office unless I am very much mistaken COURT Q Did not she say she was awful bad and she was fearful she was dying A No—she said she felt her head very bad and she thought she was dying ELLEN MAHONEY On Monday night 11th June I went to No 2 Fire Bell-alley about five minutes to 11 o clock or five minutes after—Mrs Slaughter brought a pair of steps and I went in at the up stairs window—I did not try to get in at the door—I found no one in the up stairs room—I went down stairs and found the deceased lying on the bed in the down stairs room—I did not look at her so as to see whether she was alive or dead—the prisoner was in the room sitting in a chair asleep behind the door—I believe he was drunk—I roused him up—he did not get up at the moment he did afterwards and he staggered about—he was afterwards taken into custody PHILIP POWELL policeman K 364 From information I had I went to this house on Monday 11th June about 11 o clock at night—I could not get in things were very quiet and I went away—I heard more and went again about 12 o clock—I went to the door and asked for Foley twice—the prisoner came to the door and opened it—I went in and saw the deceased lying on the bed apparently in a dying state and the prisoner at the foot—I said to him What have you been doing to Hannah —he replied that she was in the same state then as she was when he came into the bouse—I looked at her and saw a mark on her left cheek—I could not say whether she was alive or dead—she did not speak—I took him into custody Cross-examined Q Did you notice that he was drunk A Yes he was drunk THOMAS HOLMES police inspector K I went to the house on Tuesday morning 12th June at half past 12 o clock—I found the deceased lying on the bed in the ground floor room she was dead and the body cold—the prisoner was not there then—I sent Powell after him and he brought him back to me—I said to him Foley this woman is dead from the effects of your violence —he said I know nothing about her I have not hurt her —I immediately sent for a surgeon—Mr Pritchett arrived first and Mr Giles shortly afterwards—the prisoner was much the worse for liquor SARAH HATES I am the wife of William Hayes—I have known the prisoner for two years and four months On the evening of 11th June about twenty-five minutes past 10 o clock I saw him next door to the Five Bells public house talking to a female who goes by the name of Maynard—I did not speak to him—1 was running down the street—he was not drunk but he was fresh for drink—he said to me Where are you running to Mother Hayes I said that I was going after some money for some work that I had taken home and I wanted bread for the children—he said he knew my husband had been idle—I said I hear you have been idle to day he said Yes I have but it is for my own satisfaction and that I will have before I sleep —I asked who had been offending him he said that b——wh—— Mother Robinson and he would have her life and the wh—— s life that was with her—I begged of him to go home to bed and not to ill use anybody but he still persisted in the oath and repeated the same words repeatedly and he said he had got a hammer in his pocket—he took my left hand and thrust it into his left jacket pocket and there I felt an iron substance like a stonemason s small hammer just such a one as I could span with my hand—he said he would take that and knock their b——heads with it—he held my hand in his possession in his pockets for some minutes—I asked him what the cause of quarrel was and he said it was because she pushed up against him—he did not say when—I told him people often pressed up against one another and not to think anything of that as an offence—he mentioned another woman and said if Mother Kit Lee came through the alley he would first warm the hammer over her head and then he would settle the other two b——s afterwards—he released my hand to show the way in which he would use it over their heads—I did not see the hammer for as soon as he let go my hand I took to my heels and ran away from him—I expected he would give me a blow with it Cross-examined Q What are you A I cane chairs and sofas—my husband worked with the prisoner for a long time—I live at No 59 East-man-street that is about three quarters of a mile from Five Bell-alley—I had been to take some work home and was going to Three Colt-street for the money—Mrs Maynard is not here—she was present during the whole of this conversation but she was rather intoxicated—I have known her about the same time as I have known the prisoner—I know where she lives but I do not know where she is now—I am positive the prisoner spoke to me first—I have a great dread of him—I never speak to him—my husband and he have worked together at different times for different employers—they have never had any quarrel nor have I—there was a little difference with a neighbour but it was nothing at all it was two years and four months ago—he has always nodded and spoken to me since and I the same to him when he was sober—the difference was this he had been making a great piece of work with several different females and he knocked me down with one of them but whether it was an accident or not I do not know I did not consider it an accident at the time he gave me two very tremendous blows—I did not give him into custody nor threaten to do so nor did my husband—my husband said he was tipsy and he was not in his proper senses when he was tipsy—there were three or four women in the row—I lived in Five Bell-alley at that time and he lodged next door but one to the deceased—I was coming along with a loaf of bread in my hand and he struck me—he did not speak but went off as quickly as possible—I afterwards saw one or two of the women he was quarrelling with with tremendous black eyes that was when he had got a man down opposite my door—my eyes were rather darkened from the heavy blows he gave me on the head—there was no quarrel between us then—I only rescued a man from being murdered by him—he was giving the man severe blows and kicks I interfered that was very possibly the reason of his giving me the blows—I told the Coroner about his addressing me as Mother Hayes—I am sure he spoke to me first—I do not know whether I have mentioned before today about my begging him to go home—I have repeatedly mentioned that he said he had a hammer in his pocket—the woman Maynard was present when he said so—I have not had any conversation with her since that night—I have mentioned before to-day that I felt an iron substance in his pocket—I did not say it was a stonemason s hammer this is the first time I have said tbat—I have mentioned before today that he said he would knock their b——heads in with the hammer—I do not think I have said before that the cause of quarrel was the deceased pushing against him or that he said he would first warm the hammer over Kit Lee s head and then finish the other two b——s afterwards—I have said before that he said he would show us which way he would use the hammer WILLIAM GILES I am a member of the College of Surgeons I was called to No 2 Five Bell-alley a few minutes after 1 o clock on Tuesday morning 12th June—I saw the deceased lying on the bed dead—I should Bay she had been dead about an hour the extremities were cold but there was warmth about the trunk—I found a contusion on the left cheek which had evidently occurred from a kick for there were five nail marks on the cheek—I found on the left half bf the lower jaw a very extensive contusion—it might have been occasioned by a violent blow equally with a kick but most probably by a kick I could not say with certainty there were no marks of nails there it was on the bone—it could not have been done by a hammer because the hammer would cause fracture—on the Thursday following assisted by Mr Pritchett I made a post mortem examination—on opening the head immediately upon removing the skull cap I discovered a rapture of the longitudinal sinus a large blood vessel that runs across the head from front to back—the blow on the cheek might have occasioned that rupture—on the anterior part of the brain I found a solid clot of blood measuring four inches by three and weighing four ounces and a drachm that represented a larger quantity of blood because some serum would have oozed away—I have no doubt that the blow was the cause of the rupture—in a row or where something unusual occurs and great excitement is the consequence more blood is sent into the head than usual—so severe a kick or kicks as the deceased appears to have had might have ruptured the sinus—it might also be caused by pressure on the jugular vein—the pressure of the blood upon the brain was the proximate cause of death—if that blood had resulted from disease it would have been either in the substance of the brain at the back of the brain or in the ventricles I saw no other cause of death—I saw no trace whatever of the use of a hammer Cross-examined Q Might not the rupture of the sinus be caused as well by a fall as a blow A It must have been a very heavy fell I think not—I do not think a violent fall and the head coming in contact with the floor or a hard substance would be likely to produce the rupture I found—I should say it was impossible for a fall to do it considering how dense the sinus is and how severe the injury must be to rupture it—it is impossible for a simple fall on any hard substance to cause a rupture of the longitudinal sinus in a person of her age and to have so large a quantity as four ounces of blood effused—I have never been engaged in a case of manslaughter from a pugilistic encounter —I know that in such cases it requires very nice discrimination to say whether death resulted from a blow or a fall in those cases the blood is always in the substance of the brain the ventricles or the posterior part of the brain you never get a large clot of blood of four ounces under the frontal bone—there was no fracture of the skull— the extravasation in this case must have been rapid the vessel ruptured being so large—I think I can positively say that the rupture was not caused by a fall there was more than an ounce of blood effused between the skin and the cheek bone and the swelling was about an inch and a half in thickness it must have been something more violent than any fall—we dissected the scalp from the cranium and took the brain entirely out CHARLES PRITCHETT I am a surgeon I assisted Mr Giles in the post mortem examination—I have heard his evidence and concur in it—I have nothing of importanfce to add to it Cross-examined Q Is there not a difficulty in deciding positively whether the proximate cause of a rupture of the sinus id a blow or a fall A As an abstract question I think there is some difficulty—I have heard the evidence to-day—I heard the first witness state that the deceased had a fall that was subsequent to her having the big lump on her jaw—if she had fallen violently on the boards the rupture might have resulted from that GUILTY of Manslaughter Aged 24 — Transported for Fourteen Years 
t18550917-876  876 HENRY WATTS was indicted for the wilful murder of Sarah Watts —He was also charged on the Coroner s Inquisition with the like offence MESSRS BODKIN and CLERK conducted the Prosecution THOMAS BRAMPTON I am in the employ of the Great Western Railway On the 14th July I was in the beer shop of the prisoner No 21 Spring-street Paddington—just after 4 o clock I saw the prisoner and his wife inside the bar—the little boy was there crying—the prisoner had a cane in his hand and he wanted to strike the boy—Mrs Watts said No you shall not strike him —the little boy made his escape down stairs and Mrs Watts said to the prisoner It would be more to your credit to send him to school as you ought to do instead of keeping him at home —on her saying that the prisoner struck her twice with the cane across the shoulders—he was the worse for liquor—I said Mr Watts you are no man for striking a woman —he asked what odds it was to me—I said it made no difference to me what passed between a man and his wife but I did not like to see a man strike a woman—he stepped up to her and said I will be d——d if I don t kill you —I said Not in my presence you will not —he made a bolt down stairs and shut the door after him and Mrs Watte was left in the bar by herself—the stairs that the prisoner went down go down into the kitchen—they were the same stairs the little boy had gone down—Mrs Watts came outside the bar—I said to her Don t cry Mrs Watts —she had before served me with some beer—she was not the least the worse for liquor—after I had my beer I went out and left her in the bar—I never saw any more of her Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q You say the prisoner was the worse for liquor A Yes—this striking with the cane was a sudden thing—he wanted to beat the boy—he did not say anything about the boy taking money out of the till—Mrs Watts was a middle sized woman not particularly large—I am sure he did not make use of the expression I am d——d if I don t kill you to me—I am quite certain of that—what he had was a cane about the size of your finger a little yellow cane MR CLERK Q You have been asked whether the blows were given in a hurry how often was she struck A He took hold of her arm with one hand and struck her twice with the cane as hard as he could ALFRED HOULSTON I am a confectioner I live at Paddington I knew the deceased Sarah Watts and her husband—on Saturday 14th July 1 went to their house in Spring-street about 20 minutes before 4 o clock—I was in the parlour which joins the bar—while there I heard a noise in the bar—I heard Mr Watts s son crying and his wife scream—I came out into the bar—I heard the prisoner s wife say to him Don t hurt Billy or Don t hit Billy I cannot be positive which—the prisoner had not anything in his hand—he pushed his wife out of the bar by forcing the door against her to make her go out of the bar—that door goes on to a landing place to which the staircase comes down from upstairs—the prisoner succeeded in forcing her out of the bar and shut the door and he remained in the bar—I went back to the parlour and some time afterwards I heard a woman screaming whom I supposed to be Mrs Watts and something like a severe push or a fall against the wainscot—the parlour adjoins the bar and the staircase comes down at the back of that parlour—I should say the screams came from the door at the foot of the stairs at the back of the bar—on hearing those screams and fall I went out into the bar—I attempted to go to that door which leads on to the staircase—the prisoner prevented me—he said I had no right to interfere—he held the door and would not allow me to go any farther—he said I had no right—I did not see anything on the other side of the door—the prisoner said she was a d—d bitch and he would do for her—after he told me not to interfere I went back to the parlour and finished my letter that I was writing—I left the house about ten minutes afterwards—the next day the 15th I called at the house at 5 or 10 minutes after 1 o clock—I saw the prisoner—I told him it was a great pity he had used his wife so or words to that effect—he told me I knew nothing about it that his wife had been drinking gin all day long with some porters belonging to the Railway and a Mrs Browning and that she was drunk and had fallen down stairs which was the cause of her being injured—I had observed on the previous day when I was at the her the state the prisoner was in—I think he was drunk—when the woman brought me in the writing materials and some ale that I had the compliments of the season passed between us that was all—she was in a state of perfect sobriety Cross-examined by MR FRANCIS Q How long had you been at the house before you heard anything A About five minutes—I was writing a letter—there is a slight partition of wood I believe between the bar and the parlour—I had been in the habit of using that house oocasionally the prisoner himself waited on me there at other times his wife and his child—I did not see the child in the bar on this occasion—I did not see any cane—all I heard was the expression Don t hurt or hit Billy —that was the son—I do not know whether that was his name—when I saw the prisoner on the Sunday I said It is reported that you struck your wife —he said In striking the child I may have struck her with the cane but it was not intentionally —when he used the expression about doing for her he was in an excited state very much so—he appeared to have been drinking that day JOHN KENDALL I live at Knightsbridge On Saturday 14th July I called at No 21 Spring-street about 4 o clock—there was no one in the bar—I saw a child a girl standing just out of the bar at the foot of the stairs crying—the next thing I saw was a woman fall at the bottom of the stairs—she was at the foot of the stairs with her head against the wainscot—I do not think I was there more than two minutes altogether—it was almost instantly—she came down very suddenly and fell flat—seeing her fall I stepped forward to assist her—I then saw the prisoner—he came forwards into the bar and shut the door after him which divided the staircase from the bar—he had come down stairs—I requested him to allow me to go and assist the woman—he had come forward before I stepped to her and had shut the door after him to prevent my going—I requested him to allow me to pick the woman up—he told me it was his affair not mine and requested me to have nothing to do with it—he said it was his wife—I told him I had known him when he was a child—he said Very well this is my affair not yours I beg you will not interfere —I saw the last witness —he came from a room adjoining the bar—he came into the bar—I did not see any more of the woman—I did not hear any scream Cross-examined by MR FRANCIS Q You could see the place where she fell A I did not see the stairs—I could see the landing at the bottom of the stairs—I cannot tell whether the prisoner was on the stairs but he came down immediately afterwards—they are winding stairs but I should not suppose she fell further than from the first landing—a person on the winding part could not see the place where the woman fell without they turned their head—this appeared a very violent fall—I did not see her head strike against any thing but it must have struck against the door post or the wainscot—there was not sufficient length for her—I knew the prisoner before—I knew him when he was a child about twelve years old but not afterwards—he did not recognise me at all—I examined the stairs a few days afterwards and found the banister gone from near the top of the first landing—I did not count the steps to that place I should fancy about eight or nine SARAH BROWNING I am now living with my husband at No 32 Market-street Edgware-road I did lodge in the house kept by the prisoner when this happened—on the day this happened I heard a noise which attracted my attention about 4 o clock in the afternoon—I heard screams and a very heavy fall—I was then sitting in the front parlour with my husband—I went out of my room in consequence of what I heard—I found Mrs Watts lying on the floor at the foot of the stairs—she was screaming—her head was about half a foot from the passage door—the little boy and little girl were crying—I tried to raise her up—I was not able—I saw the prisoner on the stairs I asked him to come and help me up with her but he would not—he said I will have nothing to do with her —my husband was at home and I had a sister there—I called to my sister and she and I were not able to get her up—I called to my husband and he came and we three got her up on her feet and helped her the best way we could into my room the back parlour which I used as a bed room—it is on the same floor as the bar—we laid her down on the bed—after we placed her there the prisoner came down stairs and followed her into my room and he tried to reach over me to strike her—he appeared to be tipsy—we got him out of the room—he came in again about two hours after into the front and back parlours he came into both the rooms—before he was put out of the room the first time the deceased was crying and holding her head and just as he went out of the room she said Oh Watts what have I done to deserve this —I do not think he heard that he was just out of the room—she might not know that he was out—nothing more passed at that time—in two hours afterwards he came into the front room—she was in the back room—the door was open—he came in with his two hands clenched and said Where is the d——d b—h and he said he would kill her—he tried to get into the back parlour—I was in the front parlour I begged him not to go in as she was trying to go to sleep—I took him by the two wrists and tried to prevent his going in but he pushed by the sofa and got into the back room—I still held him—he got one of his hands loose from mine and tried to strike her—he struck at her but did not strike her because I pulled him back by the other arm—he said she was drunk and not fit to live and he would do for her—he called her Irish and not fit to live—to the best of my recollection that was the expression—ho said she was not fit to live and the sooner she was dead the better—I persuaded him not to strike her not to ill treat her—I said You have ill treated her enough already and too much I fear —she then said Oh Henry What have I done to deserve this you cruel man to serve me so —he said You are drunk and not fit to live —she said I am not drunk the fell has upset my stomach that has made me sick —she had been sick frequently while she laid on my bed—in what she threw up I did not notice any smell of liquor not the slightest—he then turned to me and said You are drunk and have been giving her gin —I said I am not drunk I have given her no gin I have not seen any spirits for a fortnight I have given her nothing but cold water or tea —he said she should not stay in my room—she said Let me stay till I am better I will come —I said Let her stay till she is better don t disturb her now —I got him out and he went back into the front room—my husband was there at work—he is a tailor—my husband persuaded him to go out and let her abide where she was—I cannot say exactly bow long she lay in that state after he was induced to go out of the room—it might be half an hour or an hour—she then said she was better and she would go up and lay on her own bed—the servant had persuaded her to go before and she said she would when she was better—she did not sleep in a room over mine—it is a sort of double house—her room is on the first floor—when she left my room to go up stairs I went up about three steps and asked her if I should assist her—she said No I shall do nicely now thank you Mrs Browning —when she got to the top she looked over the balustrade and said I shall do nicely now —I returned to my room—after that I heard screams up stairs—but a minute or two before I heard the screams I heard Watts go up stairs—I heard his voice on the stairs—I did not hear the words he said—when I heard the screams I went down in the kitchen to the servant—she came up with me—I gave her some directions and she went up stairs—she soon returned and at the same time Watts ran down and went into the bar—the servant came back and said something to me and the child came down and said something to me—I went up and found Mrs Watts and two children in the room the little boy and the little girl—I do not know their ages—I should say ten or eleven—they were in the room crying—the deceased woman was lying on the bed perfectly insensible—her eyes were half open and she was making a noise in her throat—I went up and spoke to her she was not able to speak—she never spoke afterwards—I called for some water I thought she might have been faint—I tried all I could but she did not recover—I went down and found the prisoner in the bar—I said Watts I believe your wife is dying send for a doctor —he said Let her die and be d— I won t send for a doctor —I said It is no use your talking like that tell me who your doctor is and I will fetch him —he said I will not —he said she was drunk and had fallen down stairs—I said If you won t send for your doctor I will send for mine —he said Mind your own business you dare to send for a doctor do it at your peril —he then went into the bar and slammed the door—I went over the way to a doctor that I thought was their doctor but he was not at home—I sent for another and Mr Reece came—that might be about a quarter of an hour after I had had the conversation with the prisoner—I went up stairs before the doctor came—I found the deceased on the floor—Watts was in the room and he had hold of her but I did not see what he did for directly at that time the doctor came and I ran down to let him in—I went up stairs with the doctor—I do not remember that the prisoner said anything to him then but he did afterwards—he said I did not send for you you have no business here you only want to make a job —the doctor assisted me to get her on the bed—he looked at her and said I fear it is a concussion of the brain —the prisoner said she was drunk and he frequently ordered Mr Reece out of the room and to leave her alone—while the doctor was in the room the prisoner tried to assist to lift Mrs Watts on the bed and he said she was very tipsy—Mr Reece desired him to leave the room and told him he feared she would never recover—the prisoner went out for a short time and he came in again and again ordered Mr Reece to go away—Mr Reece said I don t wish you to have me but I shall not leave this poor woman till you send for another medical man and send for him in my presence —the prisoner said he would have Dr Forbes if he had anybody for he was a gentleman and would not charge him anything—he was sent for and Mr Reece then left giving me instructions what to do to put a bottle of water to her feet and to send for him if I wanted him if Dr Forbes did not come—when Mr Reece took his leave the prisoner was in the room and after Mr Reece had left he again dragged his wife off the bed on the floor—he got her to the hearthstone and stretched her out straight on the hearthstone—he pulled her up by her clothes in front and threw her head back on the hearthstone—he did that twice—he said he would bring her to her senses he had done that before—I tried to interfere—I tried to pull him away and he threw me across the room and my side came in contact with the bed post—I went back again to him to try to save her and he said he would serve me the same if I did not leave the room—I tried to persuade him to let her alone and leave the room—he said she was drunk and not fit to live and he would kill her—he repeated that many times—I said Watts if you don t leave her alone I will call the police you will kill her —he then went out of the room leaving her on the floor—I called the servant to help me to pick her up and put her on the bed— the servant was in the room near the door when I called her but she ran out several times because she was afraid of him —I and the servant succeeded in putting her on the bed—after we got her on the bed the prisoner came in again before Dr Forbes came—the prisoner came to the bedside dragged his wife off again on to the floor in a sitting posture—he got behind her took hold of her two shoulders and pushed her forwards with his knees—he then put his foot up and kicked her forwards—he was still making use of bad language the same as he had done before and saying he would bring her to her senses and he knew where to touch her to make her feel—when he pushed her forwards with his knee it was not towards the bed but towards the door—I got him to let her go and she fell backwards but I caught her—I held her shoulders on my arm and I lowered her down gently—he then laid hold of her legs and began shamefully treating her—I was close to him all the time trying to pull him away but I was not strong enough—I kept him off as well as I could—I got him to leave the room and I and the servant got her on the bed again—Dr Forbes then came and he examined her in the same way that Mr Reece had done and made use of nearly the same words that he feared she would never recover—during the whole time that this was going on she was in this insensible state with her eyes fixed—when Dr Forbes came and was examining her the prisoner put his hand under the bed clothes and did something to her feet—she gave a catch—I turned down the clothes to see what he was doing he had got hold of her toes—I spoke to Dr Forbes about it and he ordered him out of the room—before Dr Forbes came the prisoner had squeezed her at the back of her neck and slapped her on the breast and pinched her ear—he said he knew where to touch her to make her feel and he would bring her to Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q How long had you and your husband lived in this place A About twelve months it may be rather more—we are indebted to Mr Watts for rent—I do not know how much without my rent book was here—I did not pay the rent weekly I paid it when I had it—I do not owe 7l or 8l —I have had no dispute about it—we were always on good terms before this—the prisoner never asked me for rent in his life—I know Mrs Nash—she used to be a friend of Mrs Watts—she was not there when this happened—when Dr Forbes was there I told him I must have some one to help me I could not stand it much longer and she came while he was there—to the best of my recollection I fetched her myself—there is a Mrs Turnbull I believe a sister-in-law of Mrs Watts—she was not there—she came on the Sunday—I wished her to be sent for—she was not there at all on Saturday to my knowledge—she was not there when Dr Forbes came he came I think about 9o clock—Mrs Turnbull knew nothing about it till she came on Sunday and I told her about it—I did not say anything to her about having got into a pretty mess and that my husband would send me 100 miles in the country—I said I would rather have been 100 miles off than to have witnessed what I had witnessed or words to that effect—I did not make use of this expression I have got myself into a pretty mess —the girl who was examined before the Coroner may be about ten yean old—I believe she was examined before the Magistrate and the Coroner I believe not before the Grand Jury—I did not say to Mrs Turnbull that I would stay in the country and she did not say I should be made to come back—I said before that I wished I had been in the country and Dr Forbes said It would be no good you have seen it —Mrs Turnbull accused me for being in different tales about this matter and she said I should be well rapped on the knuckles for it—I had told her about this on the Sunday when she came and she was very much put out about it—she said her brother had no business to marry an Irish woman—Mrs Watts died on the Monday—I have never had any quarrel with this man—he never separated me and my husband when I was tipsy—I never was tipsy in my life—nobody can come forward to say I was—my husband and he got drunk one night and they both came into my room—my room was never on fire when I and my husband were sitting at the table drinking—my husband was in bed and my sister and I were in the back yard down in the wash house when there was a cry of fire we came in and Mr Watts was coming out of the room—I have never made any threats against Watts that I would hang him or anything of that kind—I am sure I have not—on the day I came from the Police Court I did not tell Mrs Turnbull I would hang him if I could—I never told that to any one Q On Sunday night did you and your husband and How it son have a gallon of beer that was drawn A No I had no beer at all I was up stairs with poor Mrs Watts on Sunday night—my husband was going to have some supper and some friends came there—Mrs Turnbull drew him some beer for supper but I was up stairs—to the best of my recollection I never tasted it—I am quite sure I have not exaggerated this matter at all in any way—the blows on the head that I spoke of by lifting up the head and letting it down were very violent and she was insensible at the time— during this period the prisoner appeared to be tipsy—he said he was not and told Dr Forbes he was not Q Have you not repeatedly said that he appeared to be very much intoxicated A I have said that he appeared to be tipsy—he appeared to be drunk but he was able to walk into the room and out again and when a man is very drunk of course he falls about—he charged me with giving his wife gin—that was not true—when he was doing what I have described he repeatedly said his wife was drunk and it would bring her to—he said that several times during the evening—he said she was drunk—I cannot tell his thoughts—he might think so for all me—from what he said to me over and over again it did not appear to me that he was under the impression that she was drunk—it appeared to me that he was intemperate—he said she was drunk—he did not say it in a manner as if he thought she was drunk—I thought he said it just for the sake of saying so Q Was any one in the room after Mr Reece left and before Dr Forbes came A The servant was in the room once or twice—she saw a part of what passed—she was there part of the time MR CLERK Q Before this Saturday had you ever had any dispute with Watts about rent A Never—there was a running account between us—I had done some things for the children and I made the last black dress that Mrs Watts ever had—to the best of my recollection I fetched Mrs Nash on the Saturday night and she remained with me till about 12 o clock—she then left me and I remained with Mrs Watts till some old lady that did washing came—I never saw Mrs Turnbull till Sunday in my life—I asked Mr Watts if he had not some relation that could come to assist me and she came on Sunday—I think it was while church was in—she told me on the Monday that I was to be well rapped on the knuckles for having told different tales and she told me on the Sunday frequently to be careful what I said for there would be other witnesses beside me ROBERT BROWNING I am the husband of the last witness I am a tailor—I lived at No 21 Spring-street about twelve months—I and my wife had been on good terms with Watts to that date—we never had any disputes with him—on Saturday afternoon 14th July about 4 o clock I was at work at home in the front parlour—my wife was sitting with me—I heard a heavy fall and screaming—my wife went out to see what was the matter—my wife s sister was in the room—my wife called her sister and then she called me—I went in the passage and helped to pick the prisoner s wife up—I found her lying in the passage when I went out—I did not see anything of the prisoner—I assisted in carrying the deceased into the back parlour—I left her just as I got her to the edge of the bed—I went into the front room—it is not necessary to go through the front room to go to the back room—there is a way from the passage—a few minutes after she was placed on the bed I heard Watts in the room—I heard his voice I do not know what he said—I remained in the front parlour—about two hours after he came into the front parlour—he said Where is that drunken b—h —I advised him not to go in to her not to ill treat her any more and my wife tried to prevent him from going in but he pushed by her—she advised him to go out—she got him part of the way between the front parlour and the back parlour—he said The b—r is not fit to live —he got into the back room and my wife followed him—I heard him swearing at my wife and saying she had nothing to do with it and he would have the d——d b—h out—the deceased remained on my wife s bed till about 7 o clock I believe—I did not notice her going up stairs—I asked my wife how she was and she said she was gone up stairs to her own room—after that I heard a fall and a scream immediately—it was up stairs—I could not tell which room it was in—my wife went out to see what was the matter—I did not go up stairs—the prisoner was drunk when he came into the front parlour and went out into the back parlour—I do not think Mrs Watts was in liquor I never knew her to be drunk Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Did you go out A I went out after that—the prisoner said his wife was drunk he called her a drunken b—h—he said several times that she was drunk and he wanted to come into the room to beat her again—that was after the first fall HANNAH SPRATMAN I was living with my sister Mrs Browning in the prisoner s house—I had been a lodger there for some months—on Saturday afternoon 14th July while sitting with my sister I heard screams and a heavy fall—my sister went out to see what was the matter—she called me and I found Mrs Watts lying upon the stairs—my brother in law also came out—I assisted in carrying her to the bed—after she was placed on the bed I bathed her head with cold water—the prisoner came in to try to get her out—I did not hear what he said—after some time he left the room and about two hours after he came back to the front parlour—he came in with his hands clenched and asked where the d—d bitch was—he pushed into the back parlour where she was and tried to strike her—he did not reach her for my sister prevented him—he said he would kill her she was only drank and not fit to live—after that he left the room and went out in the passage—I saw Mrs Watts go upstairs and after she went up I heard Watts go up—after he went up I heard screaming from upstairs—after those screams my sister went up into this upper room—I did not see or hear any one come down from the upper room after the screaming—I did not go upstairs—I saw nothing more of Mrs Watts that evening—from what I saw of her that day she was sober—she vomited but there was no smell of liquor—Watte was drunk GEORGE REECE I am a surgeon and live at No 45 Sussex-gardens I was sent for that Saturday evening to the prisoner s house a little before 9 o clock—I went immediately I had the message—Mrs Browning met me in the passage—I went upstairs with her to the bedroom—I found the deceased on the floor perfectly insensible—her pulse was very weak and the surface of the body very cold and clammy—I examined the eye—the pupil was very much dilated—it did not contract in the slightest degree—I at once expressed my opinion that she was in great danger—she appeared to be suffering under some violence to the brain—either concussion or com pression of the brain—the prisoner was in room when I stated it to be my opinion that she would not recover—he asked me who sent for me and said I had no business there he did not wish my presence or my interference and that he had not sent for me—I told him his wife was in great danger that I had no wish to interfere with the case but I should take charge of it until he had sent for some one else—I then assisted in removing her from the floor to the bed—he then gave directions to one of his children to fetch Mr Forbes and the child left the room for that purpose—we assisted his wife to the bed I and Mrs Browning and I think the servant—the prisoner attempted to assist but it appeared to me that he was not in a fit state to assist—he placed himself in a position where he could not be of use and I desired him to leave the room and I sent for a lighted candle Q Had you any opportunity of ascertaining whether she was tipsy A My attention was drawn to that by some one saying she was tipsy but there was nothing of the kind—I ordered hot water to her feet—a fall down a portion of the stairs might account for the symptoms I saw supposing that fall to have produced concussion of the brain sickness would follow as a consequence—the first impression would be insensibility but when reaction came on it might produce fulness of the vessels of the brain Q You have heard that in this case this unfortunate woman talked and walked up stairs and two hours elapsed after that before you saw her would you refer the state in which you found her after such an interval as you have described to the injuries of the fall A Such a thing is possible—if a person talked after this and went up stairs and I found her two hours after in the state in which I found her it is possible that state might be referable to the fall—there are cases in which the vessels of the brain discharge their contents and effuse the brain little by little—that is after reaction comes on—I should think the violence I have heard described after the fall might have produced the state that I saw her in—it certainly would have accelerated it Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q I believe Dr Forbes name was mentioned A It was by the prisoner and he ordered the boy to go for him JOHN GREGORY FORBES I am a member of the College of Surgeons On Saturday evening 14th July I was called to the house of the prisoner—his little boy came for me I believe about half past 9 o clock—I had attended the family before that day—I went as soon as I was sent for—I went to a room up stairs—I found the deceased lying on the bed—Ma Browning the servant and two children were in the room—Mrs Watts was insensible—I examined to see if there was any sign of spirits and there was none—I attended her till her death on Monday 16th July—I made a post mortem examination—there was a bruise on the head of the size of a crown piece immediately above the right ear—there was no other mark of injury on any part of the body no external mark but this bruise—internally there was a large quantity of blood effused on the surface of the brain beneath the bruise and extending over the whole of the hemisphere of the brain—there was no evidence of any disease previous to this—I attribute death to the injury to the head—the immediate cause was the effusion of the brain which was the effect of the injury—on my arriving at the house the prisoner was in the passage—he made a statement to me with regard to his wife—he told me that she had fallen I think he said down stairs I am not certain in consequence of having taken too much—while I was examining her in the room up stairs he was there part of the time—he put his hand under the clothes to her feet while I was there to her toes—Mrs Browning called my attention to it—what he did to the feet had an effect on the deceased—she made a start—if he had pinched her feet or any pressure on her feet it would make her start her leg—a tickle with a feather might produce the effect or it might be a pinch—at the time I was there there was a conversation passing between Mrs Browning and the prisoner—the purport of it was objecting to Mrs Browning s interference—I observed her conduct while I was in the room—there was nothing in her interference that appeared to me improper not at all—she made a statement to me as to what the prisoner had done to his wife in the room—she stated the circumstances—I could not say positively whether the prisoner was present—he was in and out of the room—I saw a girl tea or eleven years of age in the room—she made a statement to me about her father—the prisoner was intoxicated—after the woman was dead I was in the house when the prisoner was taken into custody on Tuesday the 17th—the prisoner made a statement—he said that he pushed against his wife—he said that he wished to get her back to the bar that he followed her up stairs and pulled her by the dress to get her back and not succeeding he went up above her and pushed her and she took hold of the rail of the banister it gave way and she fell—I observed that there was a banister broken but not at that time—I dare say there were fire or sir steps from the landing place to where the banister was broken—that was where the staircase was straight but it turned afterwards—the woman died on the Monday night—the prisoner was on the bed at the time—I told him of it and he turned his face away and cried Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Was he quite sober then A Yes—I have attended the family and always gratuitously except on one occasion in her confinement—the prisoner s mother was in my family and rendered us some assistance—of course in sending for me he would be sure he was sending for some one who would not charge him for attendance—I had attended this unfortunate woman—she had not complained of anything in her head except headaches nothing more—when I saw the prisoner he was intoxicated—he said to me that his wife was drunk but it was not true Q Supposing the head had been violently thrown on the hearthstone or lifted and fallen on the hearthstone do you believe you must have observed some marks on the back of the head A If it had been done with great violence—I only observed one external injury—there would have been other marks than I saw if it had been with great violence—I think there would not have been internal wounds—the effusion had extended over one hemisphere of the brain—if a person had received a push and had fallen from the banister that would occasion all that I saw because there would he no limit to the effusion—I think what the prisoner told me was that his wife was the worse for liquor or the worse for drink—that was an erroneous impression of his but still such an impression as a drunken man might take up—his wife was not a particularly heavy strong woman COURT Q Do you say that a push or a fall down stairs would account for all you saw A Yes and for her death MR PARRY Q Would a fall without a push have occasioned it A Yes—I never saw the prisoner otherwise than kind and attentive to his wife—I never heard of quarrels between them—of course I attended at times when kindness was of consequence—I think there have been five such—when he cried it appeared to be a genuine expression of emotion Q You have heard Mrs Browning s statement about the treatment on the hearth do you believe that so much violence could have taken place without some marks of injury A I think the absence of marks might be attributed to the hair being on the head MR BODKIN Q How long had you attended them A I think about four years—I have been there seven or eight times at different attendances but I have been there more frequently of course—the last medical visit I paid was in Jan this year but I had been in the house about a month before this—the deceased was a woman of sober temperate habits—the fall that has been described might account for all that I saw but such violence as has been deposed to would I think increase or accelerate the consequences of the fall COURT Q I understood you to say that this fall down the stairs would account for all that you saw and for her death do you mean for her death at the time when she died A Yes for her death when she died Q Then what happened to her afterwards could not accelerate or increase it A Yes it would have a tendency to do so but I think all I saw might be accounted for by a fall CORMACK DOWNS police sergeant D 6 I was with inspector Grant when the prisoner was taken—the inspector left him in my charge in Mrs Browning s room in his own house—the prisoner told me to sit down—he said I won t go away I have done nothing and no Jury will find me guilty I did not strike her if I did I ought to be hung —he repeated that expression three or four times—he said Certainly I had no right to push her GUILTY of Manslaughter Aged 38 — Transported for Fourteen Years

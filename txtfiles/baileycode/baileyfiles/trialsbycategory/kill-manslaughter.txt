I heard Wilson and the Deceased say something about To-morrow but I cannot tell the Words - And I think I heard Wilson say to Skerret I am your humble Servant afterwards I understood they were gone into the Street to fight and then I went to call the Guard and saw they were parted I saw Capt Wilson coming up the Steps into the Room and a Soldier had hold of the Deceased and brought him into the Room I do not know but the Deceased might give Capt Wilson Occasion by something that he said to come to him again but all on a sudden Capt Wilson came with his Sword drawn again and they fell upon one another and in a Minute s Time the least that could be imagined I heard the Deceased say I have Night I heard something said of Tomorrow but I cannot tell what - I believe the Wound was given in the Coffee-House for he dropped immediately Capt Mr Caugh had his Sword drawn and I suppose endeavoured to part them - He died at our House - The first Sword I saw drawn in the House was Capt Mr Caugh s it was at the Time that he said If you have a Mind for a little Diversion I am your Man Capt Mr Caugh I came into the Tilt-Yard Coffee-House about Four o Clock in the Afternoon the 10th Carr and Innys &c were there and desired I would come up Stairs which I did some time afterwards came in Mr Wilson who heard I was there and sent up Word if his Company would be acceptable he would come up I sent Word down I should be glad of it he came in and Carr went away We continued there from that Time till about Ten o Clock the Deceased then insisted upon drinking some more Wilson insisted that we should drink no more but would go to the Play We took Coach and went and when we came there the Play was over we returned back again to the Tilt-Yard Coffee-House went into a small Room within the Coffee-Room and called for some Punch we were told that Mr Richardson was there and enquired for Capt Wilson the Prisoner desired leave to introduce him then Capt Skerret said d - n him he is a Scrub or Words to that Effect He shall not come into my Company Capt Wilson said he believed he mistook his Character upon which they had some peevish Words Wilson went out and Skerret told me I was as had as him meaning Richardson upon which I told him he seemed vastly quarrel some the whole Night and No-body had given him any Reason and that it was a Matter of Indifference to me whether he came in or not as I had never seen the Gentleman before Skerret s Answer to me was d - n your Blood your are a Rascal upon which I laid my Hand to my Sword and said my Station in the Army would not suffer me to bear such Language - I cannot tell whether I drew my Sword or no and I believe I said if Mr Skerret has a Mind to quarrel with any Body I am his Man for he has grossly affronted me Upon which the Woman of the House and one Mr Walker who was in the Coffee-Room laid hold of me I told them they might let me go for I promised them upon my Word and Honour I would have no Words with Skerret that Night we went into the Room again shook Hands and were Friends - This Quarrel which was the Occasion of his Death was immediately afterwards he was going to quarrel with me again but I would not the Deceased turned about to Wilson what he said to him I cannot tell I saw them both bounce up all on a sudden and go into the Coffee-Room who went out first I cannot tell Mr Walker and I continued sitting by the Fire I saw Mr Richardson follow them heard him call the Guard I told Mr Walker should not follow them for fear I should fall into the Quarrel myself - I did not see what happened in the Street when they returned I saw Wilson glance by the Door of the little Room which I was in and saw some Blood upon his Shirt I started up and went to the Door of the Room and immediately saw Skerret break loose from two Soldiers of the Guard who had hold of him in the Coffee Room after Skerret had broke loose from the Soldiers Wilson met him half Way in the Centre of the Coffee-Room and they began to attack one another afresh and fell to pushing I drew my Sword and beat down their Passes and told them they were both under Arrest - There were a good many Passes I beat them down as fast as I could - The Deceased had a Wound in his Breast pointing a little towards the Right-Side he said he had got enough for this Night dropped down and died on the Spot - From the first to the last of this Quarrel it was not above a Quarter of an Hour Q To Gadsdon Was not the Deceased very drunk before the Quarrel began Gadsdon They were all in Liquor Q I ask you whether he was not so much in Liquor that he was not able to stand when he went to make Water some Time before that Gadsdon He was very much in Liquor but not so much in Liquor but that he was able to stand - I took him to be the worst in the Company Q Do you know this Sword Gadsdon I think Capt Mr Caugh gave me this Sword and bid me take care of it - This is the Deceased s Sword it lay naked in the Room after the Deceased was dead it was bent at the Point The Sword was bent about six or seven Inches towards the Point Q to Capt Mr Caugh Did not the Prisoner draw his Sword first upon Capt Skerret Capt Mr Caugh I am not certain who drew first Q Could the Wound the Deceased received in his Breast be given if he had been in a Posture of Defence Capt Mr Caugh I do not know - the Wound might be received when he was off his Guard Prisoner to Gadsdon Did not you see the Deceased seize upon me first Gadsdon Really I cannot say whether he did or not - Skerret s Sword was draw g before Wilson s Q Was Skerret s Sword drawn at the Time that Richardson laid hold of Skerret the bid him be quiet Gadsdon The Sword was first drawn by Skerret at the Time Capt Mr Caugh said If you have a Mind for a little Diversion I am your Man that was at the Time Richardson had hold of him as near as I can guess Capt Richardson confirmed the other Evidence with Respect to the reconciling the first Difference As we were sitting together in the little Room I heard Capt Skerret make use of the Word dare and all on a sudden he and Capt Wilson jumped off their Seats and rushed out of the little Room into the Coffee-Room I went out after them and saw Skerret in a rising Posture I took hold of his Sword which was drawn in his Hand and in endeavouring to get it from him I run the Point into the Calf of my Leg and desired the Servants to call the Guard Skerret got from me and rushed towards the Street-Door Wilson was then at the Door and said stay or helt till I have drawn my Sword I went into the Street saw three Soldiers and called to them to part them for fear of Murder - Skerret s Sword was drawn at first but Wilson s was not I heard their Swords clash but the Soldiers parted them Wilson came in first then Skerret came in and the Soldiers had hold of him by the Arm and the Soldiers struggled to get the Sword from him but Skerret got from the Soldiers and advanced towards Wilson Wilson was at the other End of the Coffee-Room with his Sword in his Hand and then Wilson advanced towards him and they made several Passes at each other - I do not know whether the Wound was given in the Street or in the House Mr Mackenzie Surgeon I was called about one or two in the Morning about the 20th of January and when I came into the Coffee-Room I saw Mr Skerret lying upon the Floor he was dead before I I came I found a Wound in his Breast which was mortal and was desired by the Coroner the next Day to open the Body there were four Wounds in the Trunk of the Body one on the right Side which penetrated into the right Lobe of the Lungs there was another on the Breast-Bone which went through the Sternon there was another Wound towards the left Groin but that did not penetrate - the Wound went aflant Mr Heath Surgeon I was sent for to view the Body I endeavoured to introduce a Probe which I could not do I found a Wound upon the Breastbone there was one passed between the fourth and fifth Rib on the right Side penetrating into the right Lobe of the Lungs and another a little obliquely into the Sternon which I apprehend to be the mortal Wound - I do apprehend he was in a fighting Posture when he received that Wound he might receive it when he was recovering from a Lunge - there are two Wounds which did not penetrate and one upon the Leg Q How deep was the Wound Mr Heath It was through the Breast-Bone a little obliquely into the left Ventricle of the Heart - He was in a disadvantageous Posture when he received the Wound - I do not say he was in a Posture of Defence - The Wound was a little inclining to the Left - There was a Wound on the left Side of the Navel - I am not a Judge of Duelling - but I apprehend that Wound might be received on a Recovery from a Lunge John Cluer I was Centinel upon Duty that Night West and Wright and I were talking together I saw Capt Skerret come out of the Coffee-house with his Sword drawn and another Gentlemen followed him and they fell a pushing said I to Wright They are doing Murder I laid hold of Capt Skerret and Wright of Capt Wilson Wilson went into the Coffee-house and Skerret swore he would kill me if I did not let him go Skerret forced himself from me and made a push at me and then run into the Coffee-Room and I followed him then they fell to fighting - I cannot say whether Wilson s Sword was drawn he was at the farther End of the Room I did not hear any Words pass but they fell a pushing away there were several Passes in the Room and Skerret dropped his Sword out of his Hand and said I have enough now I will defer it till To-morrow and dropped - he slipped gently to the Ground - The Prisoner did not make any Push after the Deceased s Sword dropped Q Did not the Prisoner say Now Capt one more Push for your Honour Cluer I did not hear any such Thing Richard West confirmed Cluer s Evidence and said that Skerret made a Push with his Sword against the Door which he believes was the Occasion of its being bent that there were three or four Passes and the Deceased dropped that Wilson said Have you enough and the Deceased said I have enough I will defer it till another Day or another Time Daniel Wright confirmed Part of the foregoing Evidence and says the Deceased said when he came into the Coffee-Room the last Time He would be revenged or see it out or something to that Purpose And being asked Why he did not prevent this Mischief said He swore he would be the Death of him and thought his Life was as sweet to himself as the other s to him William Strain produced by the Prosecutor agreed with the foregoing Evidence in most of the Circumstances he says That when Wilson came into the Coffee-house after the Rencounter in the Street his Sword was drawn and that when the Deceased came in he cannot tell whether Wilson was in the little Room or the Coffee-Room he went up towards the Fire-place whether his Sword was drawn or not he cannot tell and that Wilson came round the right Side of the Post and said Now fight me or something to that Purpose and then they fell to fighting and he heard the Deceased say he had enough and dropped against a Table Gen Wentworth Last September was Twelve-month the Prisoner came to me in the Island of Cuba upon the Recommendation of a Gentleman and I appointed him a Lieutenant he is a Person of a civil peaceable Behaviour Gen Blakeny gave him the same Character Col - I commanded the Regiment in the West-Indies in which Wilson was a Lieutenant he is a Person of a general good Behaviour he is neither addicted to quarreling or any other Vice whatever The Council for the Prisoner asked Gen Wentworth Whether the Prisoner would not have been broke by a Court Martial had he declined fighting the Deceased Gen Wentworth They pass severe Censures on such Occasions Court That is a strange Question in this Court Guilty of Manslaughter Transportation See summary

he gave him the pot and laughed - I do not know why he laughed unless it was about the tea they had been at work there all the afternoon and were friendly together - I heard no words between them I did not see the father drink but I saw him throw the pot and the boy fell I saw the pot fly before me but did not see him throw it he was about two yards from his son - I do not know how much tea there was in the pot when the son handed it to him or whether there was any when the boy fell I saw the father jump off the dust-hill pick him up and take him a little distance off then run back he fetched a handkerchief off the hill and in a few minutes both he and the boy were gone I saw some blood come from the side of the boy s head his father immediately went for the handkerchief - the boy stood there while he fetched it - the prisoner seemed extremely sorry but I did not hear any words pass between them he was a kind father to the boy ROSETTA FLINT I was in Sinnot s yard sifting dust the prisoner and his son were then at work - the son was taking the stuff away as we sifted it about four o clock the boy had a pewter pint pot in his hand the father asked him for a drop of tea - the boy gave him the pot and langhed at him - I do not know why he laughed or whether there was any tea in the pot though I had seen some in it before the father said it was not pretty in him to laugh at him and threw the pot at him I did not see it go out of his hand - it struck him on the right side of his head - I saw the blood the boy fell on the stones - the prisoner took him up immediately fetched a handkerchief off the dust heap and led him out of the yard by the hand I had seen the son laugh myself I do not think I ever said I had not the father appeared very sorry for what he had done OLIVE ASHLEY I was in Sinnot s yard - the prisoner and his son William who was about ten years old were there - the son had some cold tea in a pewter pot the prisoner asked him for a drop he then drank the tea out of it then gave the pot to the father and laughed at him the prisoner never spoke a word - I cannot say whether he looked into the pot or put his mouth to it - I did not see the pot thrown he was about two yards from his son on a little heap about a quarter of a yard high the son stood on the ground I did not see the pot thrown but saw the boy fall before me at the side of the heap I was sitting on - I did not see the pot as it gave me a turn the father jumped off the heap took him up immediately and stood him five or six yards off while he fetched a handkerchief off the hill then the boy walked out of the yard with him I cannot say what the father did with the handkerchief he appeared sorry for what he had done and cried very much all next day they were always very friendly and were so that afternoon he was a very good father to him MR WILLIAM HARRISON LAWRENCE I am an apothecary and live in Ray-street Clerkenwell The boy was brought to me on the 15th of August by the prisoner he had a violent blow on the right side of the head it was a lacerated wound - had fractured the bone and the brains protruded I merely applied a handkerchief as a bandage to keep it steady - it bled and I advised his being sent to St Bartholomew s hospital the boy was about ten or eleven years old a pewter pot might have inflicted the wound - anything with a circular edge might have done it the boy remained in my shop about ten minutes while the prisoner fetched him a jacket - he then took him away on his back to the hospital MR JOHN NORMAN WEEKS I am house-surgeon of St Bartholomew s hospital On Friday the 15th of August this boy was brought in - I do not know who by he was about ten years old I found a large lacerated wound on the right side of the head - his skull was extensively fractured and driven in on the bone the wound was about three inches long and about three quarters deep the skull was fractured just above the right ear - part of the brain was exposed and came through the wound - every thing proper was done to him I saw him several times every day - he got worse and died on Friday the 21st at the hospital his head was opened and the right hemisphere of the brain was in a state of suppuration he died of inflammation on the brain arising from the blow he had received it might have been inflicted by the sharp edge of anything a pewter pot might have occasioned it DANIEL BENJAMIN LEADBETTER I am a marshal s-man of the City St Bartholomew s Hospital is in the City Prisoner s Defence I asked him for a drop of cold tea - he kept laughing at me and making game of me I said If you don t be quiet with your games I ll give you a pat of the head - he gave me the pint pot with just the grounds of the tea I went to heave the pot away - he turned away and fell against a large stone I went and picked him up and found his head bleeding I tied it up and took him down to the doctor s - I then brought him to the hospital and held him while they dressed him ROSETTA FLINT re-examined The boy s head went on a stone OLIVE ASHLEY I saw a stone in the yard - it was dug up and taken to the prisoner s house he fell with his face on the stone Mr WEEKS If he had simply fallen on a stone I think this sort of wound would not have followed - he must have been struck with considerable violence Q Suppose he had been knocked down with the pot and fallen on a stone and the part where the wound was had come in contact with the stone would the same wound have been produced A I think it possible but not very probable MRS NEWELL When his head was struck his face was towards the prisoner ROSETTA FLINT His face was towards the prisoner when I saw him and when he was struck his back was towards him OLIVE ASHLEY I saw nothing of him after he gave his father the pot - his face was towards him then MR WEEKS It is impossible for me to say whether the blow was occasioned by the pot or stone - there was only one blow JURY to ROSETTA FLINT Q Did you see the boy hold the pot to his father A Yes - he was about two yards off and when the boy was down the pot lay on the right side I think OLIVE ASHLEY The boy fell at my feet - his face pitched on the stone he was about two yards from his father and stretched his hand out to give him the pot GUILTY Aged 44 Of Manslaughter only -

t18290910-51  Before Mr Baron Vaughan 1582 WILLIAM DAVIS PATRICK FLYNN and MICHAEL DRISCOLL were indicted for feloniously killing and slaying Frederick Winkworth MR BODKIN conducted the prosecution THOMAS WINKWORTH I live at No 11 Osnaburgh-street Regent s-park I had a brother named Frederick - On Sunday the 26th of July I was outside the King s Arms Tottenham-court-road with him a sawyer was with him whose name I do not know - I was never in his company before neither of the prisoners were there that morning - I met my brother at the same place on the following morning he was having his shoes cleaned outside the door - it was about nine o clock I went from there to the Bromley Arms kept by Eales in Cleaveland-street Fitzroy-square - my brother came there after me in a coach I do not know who was with him several were in the coach - Flynn and Driscoll his two seconds were at the house whether they came in the coach I do not know - I did not hear in the prisoners presence what the fight was to be for I heard there was to be a fight and the winner was to have a certain sum - that was said at Eales previous to the coach arriving Flynn and Driscoll might have come in the coach or after it - I was there some time before it arrived I saw them there before it left - it waited there to take up somebody else I do not know the names of the persons who went in the coach - I went for one but got out in Hampstead-road near the Mother Red Caps and walked my brother was one - I think there were five or six in all in the coach neither of the prisoners were there that I know of but as far as Hampstead-road there were five - I got out in Hampstead-road Paddy Flynn got in my place and Chicken Driscoll was outside I believe there were several outside - I believe Driscoll had been outside all the way I had seen Driscoll and Flynn before - I think I have seen Flynn at the Tennis-court - Eales who keeps the public-house has been a pugilist but has retired from the ring some years Driscoll is called the St Giles chicken and Flynn Paddy Flynn I believe they have fought in the ring - I have read an account of them in the paper I went to the Red Lion at Hampstead and met the persons I had left in the coach - the party assembled there we went to a field at the back of the house called Tebbet s-field a ring was formed and they commenced sparring-Davis and my deceased brother were the combatants Flynn and Driscoll were his seconds - James Raines and Edward Murphy were Davis seconds several others called beaters out were in the ring and several with watches in their hands - I do not know that any particular time-keeper was appointed I did not hear Time called during the fight - I was in the ring part of the time they first went into the ring about two o clock and began to spar - the constable interrupted them and they went to another field not far off I should think a good mile - my brother rode to the second field he was in very good health and said he never felt better in his life - a ring was formed before he left the coach the two fighters and the same four seconds entered the field - I believe in getting over the fence of the field my brother sprained his ankle but it got better and he did not go lame into the ring he was a much slighter man and not so heavy as Davis - the fight began my brother was gaining the battle fast at the outset but in one part of the fight he slipped and fell without a blow being struck several parties called out Foul and went into the ring to see how he had slipped it was found a hole had caused it and it was declared fair - they went on fighting I went into the ring at that time to take some brandy in and to prevent the fight if I could but I was beat out - my brother was generally undermost at the close they fell together Davis generally uppermost - when my brother fell Flynn and Driscoll picked him up and attended to him as seconds generally do I should consider the fight continued half an hour but my anxiety was very great - I was chiefly attending to my brother I was inside the ring at several parts of the fight - I was frequently at too great a distance to hear what my brother might say COURT Q You could tell what state he was in whether he was able to go on A After he fell he gave two tremendous blows to Davis and the battle was certainly very much in his favour - he was gaining ground till he gave in himself the last round he fought his seconds took him on their knees he was brought up to the mark to fight again - he shook hands with Davis and put an end to it himself MR BODKIN Q Do you mean to say that at that time he exhibited no symptoms of weakness and exhaustion A He was weak the same as the other man - he stood to the scratch himself and put out his hand he did not speak a word from that moment till he died for Inever left him - he was quite insensible when carried off the ground and remained so till his death which was about five o clock the evening following neither of his seconds assisted in carrying him off the field COURT Q Had he been training for the fight A In the morning at breakfast he had 1 lb of beef steaks and told me he had done so for a fortnight each morning Cross-examined Q Was he considered the favourite A He certainly was he gained the battle fast at first and was a much better man than Davis - he was afraid to come near him my brother was generally the first to strike the blows - many people went into the ring when Foul was called and were beat out it was after he fell that the fight was so much in his favour Q When he came up to the scratch at the last round who bad the best of it then A It was evident my brother had the worst then on account of the fall - it was proved the fall caused a concussion of the brain and not any blows JOHN PHILLIPS I am a broker and live on Red Lionhill I was going home and went to see this fight at Child s-hill Hendon it joins Hampstead parish - I got there about a quarter-past two o clock and was there when the ring was formed and the whole of the time I consider the fight lasted about an hour and a quarter sixty or seventy rounds were fought - Davis decidedly had the advantage at the latter part of it but at first I considered the deceased to be a much better boxer Davis was the strongest - the other two prisoners acted as seconds - they fought about half an hour and then Davis appeared getting the advantage the deceased often came up after that merely to be knocked down - that was generally the case he appeared weak and incapable of resistance merely striking a blow and going down with it he seemed to fall with the blow often without being struck by his antagonist - it was considered that it was done to gain wind I never heard him say any thing I saw him come up the last time - he was brought up by his seconds to the scratch and they retired he stood up and put himself in a fighting attitude then dropped his arms and put out his hand - Davis shook hands with him and Winkworth was carried away a very stout man took him up in his arms to the outside of the ring he had not fallen down Q Was he able to walk out of the ring A The ring closed in directly they shook hands and I could not see them I saw him being carried out of the field he appeared in a very languid state and insensible - his head lolling over the arms of the man who carried him away they took him towards a coach but I did not follow I have been at prize-fights before - I heard no observation about taking him away in my judgment he fought a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes longer than he ought to have been allowed - I heard Driscoll during the fight urging him on saying Give him one for me the seconds on both sides excited their men undoubtedly Cross-examined Q Are you not a constable A No I have been one I did not act as one on this occasion - I know nothing about Driscoll surrendering himself I heard Foul cried on one occasion when the deceased fell without a blow - I was present when a constable of Hampstead interfered he said they must not fight in that parish but go elsewhere - I heard somebody say Go to Child s-hill and fight it out there I cannot say whether that was said by the constable or not TIMOTHY COLLINS I am a green-grocer and live at Hampstead I was at the fight at Child s-hill Davis appeared the strongest man - I was in the ring close to the deceased he was distressed from the beginning of the fight and as long as I stopped which was not till the end - I thought at first he was the best man but the weakest he was in distress but the best at sparring - he fell every time sometimes they fell together and sometimes he fell alone - I thought it was from weakness in his knee he was always undermost while I stopped I heard him say So help me G-d I am not able to fight any longer that was when they had fought about a quarter of an hour or more - he said that to Flynn and Driscoll his seconds they took him up again directly as usual and one of them I think Driscoll patted him on the back I stopped about a quarter of an hour after that and left the fight going on- the deceased seemed very weak all the time he was lead up to the scratch and sometimes fell without being struck he did not appear in a fit state to continue the fight Cross-examined Q How long do you think he fought after he said he was not able A I think it must have been three quarters of an hour after from what I heard but I left in a quarter of an hour I went out of the ring and laid down - I saw no more but in three quarters of an hour after I left he was brought out of the ring I heard him groan - I was in the field all the time I heard Foul cried once there were not a great many people there JOSEPH HUNT I sell fruit and live at Hampstead I saw the latter part of the fight it had began when I got up - I saw the deceased brought up to a place he seemed very insensible and not able to fight - the seconds brought him up to the scratch and when they brought him up he seemed to lay his head on his second s shoulder - they had hold of him by the arm and he leaned his head back on one of their shoulders when he got to the scratch before they left him it was then said the battle was lost - the people rushed in he was put into a coach and taken away Cross-examined Q Were you outside the ring A Yes I did not see him put himself in a fighting attitude he might have done so MR WILLIAM HENRY STEPHENSON I am a surgeon and live at Hampstead On the 27th of July about half-past four o clock I saw the deceased at the Red Lion in a perfect state of insensibility I found bruises on his face and blows about the eye - he had the usual symptoms of compression of the brain I resorted to the usual remedies but without effect - I had scarcely any hope of him he died about five o clock the next day - his head was opened in my presence by Mr Kearney who is out of town on the whole surface of the right hemisphere of the brain there was from four to six ounces of blood effused extravasated blood on the surface of the brain arising from a rupture of a vessel that was quite sufficient to cause his death - a person falling repeatedly in pugilistic contest would be likely to occasion that Cross-examined Q Might the appearances have beenoccasioned by a fall as well as a blow A They might COURT Q Might not the very excitement or action of fighting when the powers of the brain are put to their greatest extent occasion a rupture A It is possible I attribute the death to the whole fight in combination the brain being in that state one particular fall would then cause it - the greater the excitement the greater the predisposition MR CHARLES LAW I am a surgeon of Hampstead I saw the deceased two hours after Mr Stephenson and was present at the opening of the head - I perfectly concur in his opinion the blows and falls he received were quite sufficient to produce the extravasation of blood which caused his death Cross-examined Q Might not a severe fall be sufficient to account for it A One alone might but the circumstances altogether are more probable one single fall might create the rupture but which fall I of course cannot say Davis Defence The deceased was a man who for the last two years was continually brow-beating me he has struck me and challenged me to fight - I have refused to fight a man with a family I am a writer and engraver by trade and have a family - I never would fight him till one night he met me drunk a fortnight previous to the fight he said Well Bill I should like to fight you above every body because they call you the slashing painter - why won t you fight me I can get money to fight I said I shall not fight - you can get a living where I cannot I knew he had fought many battles before - he would when intoxicated up with his fist and strike a man in a moment - he would go into public-houses drink people s beer and if they spoke spit in their faces when I told him of my wife and family he said Wife and family be b-d she is a bl-y wh-e I said Well Bill if it has come to that I will fight you to-morrow which was agreed to he came to me in about an hour and said I won t fight you to-morrow - I will fight you for money I said Where am I to get money he said You can get money at Eales he appointed to fight me on Monday fortnight and we fought Prisoner Flynn I wish to ask Collins if I could hear the man say he would not fight any more TIMOTHY COLLINS Yes he was quite near enough to hear it he did not say so only once but several times EDWARD LOWE I am a carver in wood and live in Tottenham-court-road I have known Davis two years and a half he bore a quiet good character and was a hard-working man I was present when the deceased struck him - that was eleven months ago he has frequently challenged him since I have heard him call him abusive names - he has said I should like to fight you because I could warm the wax in your ear-holes so nicely FRANCIS MAY I am a shoemaker and keep a house next door to Davis - I have known him nine months I advised him not to fight the man but he said he had been so grossly insulted he could not brook it any longer DAVIS - GUILTY Aged 24 Confined Twelve Months FLYNN - GUILTY Aged 25 DRISCOLL -

t18311020-150  Before Lord Chief Justice Tenterden 2106 RICHARD TURPIN was charged on the Coroner s Inquisition with killing and slaying Sarah Turpin MR BALL conducted the prosecution JAMES HENRY ANDREWS I am a Policeman On Thursday the 21st of October at two o clock in the morning I was in Three Colt-alley opposite Cinnamon-street and saw some clothes come out of the two pair of stairs window of Delay s house - I was about twenty-five yards off and before I could get to the house I saw a bed come out I went to the house and hearing a cry of Murder I tried to break the door open but could not but in a short time the prisoner s wife and Mrs Delay came out at the side door - Mrs Turpin ran to the bedclothes I stood by her - she turned over the bed and clothes and found her child underneath in the middle of them it was in its night clothes and had some mud on its cap - it appeared completely stunned it did not cry it was about a month old - I took the candle out of Mrs Delay s hand and went up to the second floor front room- I saw the prisoner standing at the foot of the bedstead with merely his trousers and shirt on there was a little child between three and four years old screaming on the floor - it was undressed my brother-officer accompanied me to the room - Mrs Turpin had the child on her arms- I seized the prisoner he knocked the candlestick out of my hand on the bed he up with his first and struck his wife over my shoulder she at that time had the child in her arms - I took hold of him and said he must come with me he appeared to have been drinking but not much - he asked me to stop while he put on his stockings and shoes but I would not when we got into the street I asked how he came to throw the child out of window - he merely laughed but made no answer and as I took him along Green-bank he tried to get from me but could not - there was nothing thrown out but the clothes and the bed WILLIAM CLAYTON I am a Policeman I accompanied Andrews - I said to the prisoner What a villain you must be to throw your child out of window he said I did not mean to do it or I did not mean to hurt the child I am not certain which - the child s head appeared to have a large swelling on it and there was a dirty mark on the cap I saw the cap taken off at the doctor s and there was a large swelling on the head- that was a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after it was not dead for I heard it cry after that - leeches were applied to the head the prisoner was rather the worse for liquor but not much so EDWARD CONOLLY I lodge at Delay s house On Friday the 21st of October I was awoke by a disturbance - I saw the child in the mother s arms I knew it - it was called Sarah Turpin I saw leeches on its head - it died in my room in about an hour and a half I saw the head was very sore and soft where it had come to the ground - I saw it die EDWARD DELAY I live at No 12 King Edward-street Wapping The prisoner lodged in my second floor front room with his wife and two children - on the 21st of October about two o clock in the morning my wife awoke me I found the prisoner s wife in my bed-room crying - she asked me to go and appease her husband and as I went out of my room I heard the second floor front window thrown open and on entering the room the little boy was standing on the floor quite naked and crying the prisoner had a pillow in his hand and was in the act of throwing that as I thought out of window- I laid hold of him and said Do you know what you are about are you mad I prevented his throwing it out - he made no answer but laid hold of the bed I laid hold of it and said Rick are you mad he said D - n my bl - y eyes I will heave out every hit in the place - I will smash them all I prevented his throwing the bed out - his wife then came into the room and exclaimed My child my child the bed was then at the foot of the bedstead on the floor - the prisoner made an attempt to strike her I prevented him and stamped my foot thinking the child must be under the bed smothered - I said D - n you pick the child up she turned over the bed two or three times but did not find it and then she screamed out My child is thrown out of window the prisoner was present - he made no reply that I heard she directly ran down stairs and I after her with a light - I saw her pick up the child she said it was dead - it did not cry then two Policemen came up - I gave one of them the light and he went up stairs I saw the child after it came from the doctor s - its head was grazed and swollen but there was no blood I thought the prisoner very much in liquor EDWARD BYRNE I am a surgeon and live in Old Gravel-lane The child was brought to me by the mother and two Policemen - I examined it and found a very large tumor on the head and a fracture of the skull - this unquestionably caused its death I ordered leeches as the only resource but entertained no idea that it would be of benefit - I have not a doubt that it died of the fracture on the head FRANCIS FAGAN I am an inspector of the Police The prisoner was brought to the station at a quarter-past two o clock - I asked what could induce him to throw the child out of window he laughed incessantly and I asked him no more questions then - in the morning when Ifound him more composed I asked what induced him to do it he cried and said he had thrown his wife s duds out but gave no answer about the child Prisoner s Defence I know nothing about the child- I saw it at ten o clock in the morning when I went to work but never afterwards I did not know it was there till next day when Fagan asked me about it - I leave it all to your Lordship GUILTY Aged 33 - Transported for Life 
t18341124-189a  189 JOHN DESMOND WILLIAM DESMOND HANNAH DONOVAN JOHANNA MURPHY and MARY HURLEY were indicted for feloniously killing and slaying John Cole they were also charged with the like offence on the Coroner s inquisition GEORGE COLLINS I am a labouring man and live in Union-court At the time in question I lived in the Maze and worked for Smith and Sharpe—I did not know John Cole—he was a stranger to me when this happened—I was told his name by the Jury—I did not see his body—I saw him delivered at the hospital—I went part of the way up Deane-street and helped him to the hospital gates—I was told before the Coroner s inquest and by his captain that his name was John Cole Q Did you see him receive any injury A On Sunday the 10th of August about a quarter past eight o clock I saw John Desmond and Dennis Donovan strike the deceased four times to my certain knowledge and his son William Desmond succeeded him afterwards—Cole was trying to get from them as far as laid in his power and begged for mercy but no mercy was shown him—it happened just by Mr Smith s door at the corner of Union-street Maze Tooley-street Borough—I did not see any provocation given by Cole—I saw him surrounded by these people endeavouring to escape but he could not he was overpowered—I did not see him strike any blow at all—when the man was down and I ran to his assistance John Desmond kicked him on the left breast just on his left ribs—he fell from the blows he received from Dennis Donovan who is not apprehended—Cole begged for mercy—I wished to assist him but I was in danger of my life and in assisting him to lift his head up from the flag stones I was struck three times myself—John Desmond struck him repeated blows both right and left and struck him on the left ear—William Desmond repeated it to follow his father s blows and struck him in any part which laid in his power—I saw him strike him and he hit him more than two three or four times—the deceased kept on his legs at first—he made no resistance it was out of his power he was so overpowered—John Desmond kicked him when he was down and Hannah Donovan scratched and kicked him when he was down—as he was falling she tore his face and kicked him afterwards—I cannot say what offence he had given to these people—Murphy had nothing to do with that—nor as to what Mary Hurley did—I went to Guy s Hospital gates and left Cole there—I did not see his corpse—I did not see any of the surgeons who took care of him—I was not at the first coroner s inquest but I was at the second one—there was a bit of a skirmish but I did not see Cole strike any blow—he had no friend there but me—they were all round him—he called for mercy but got none Cross-examined by MR WHALESBY Q Were there a great many people in the place when you came up A Yes there was a hundred I should suppose when I first came up—there was a very great disturbance—the noise attracted me to the spot—I was up stairs reading my Testament—I heard the noise and went down into the Maze—how it originated I do not know—Cole was dressed as a sailor—there was one more sailor present but he escaped and went into Mrs Smith s house or they would have served him the same way—I suppose there were ten of them altogether skirmishing—it is impossible for me to give an answer as to who gave the woeful blow but hearing him cry out for mercy and being the only Englishman among them I thought it right to interfere—I took Cole to a doctor s shop at first who refused to take him in and I assisted him up Deane-street—he appeared to me quite sober—he was not able to walk to the hospital as he was abused and cut—he was obliged to be carried—I helped to carry him part of the way—he appeared to me to be sober—he might have had a pint of beer or two—he was not the worse for liquor to my knowledge—he did not appear like a man affected with drink—John is the father of William Desmond—I did not hear a word from John Desmond but William Desmond mind you is innocent—he was reading his book when he was called out in an Irish tongue which I could not interpret—I saw his father fighting and he went up and helped his father—that was the first of William Desmond s interfering at all—he was brought into it innocently being told his father was fighting he came out to assist him—how John Desmond first began to fight I do not know—I can only speak to these three women being present—I understand there were other women present but Hannah Donovan is the only one I have to mention about—there were plenty of other women present EDWARD WILKINSON I live in the Maze in Tooley-street I saw Dennis Donovan strike the man when John Desmond crossed the road and kicked him in the lower part of his body while he was on the ground—I did not know Cole before—I only heard his name by its being on my summons—I saw Johannah Murphy kick the man in the breast—I saw no more then—they took him to Roach s and from there to the doctor s—he laid on the ground till they picked him up and took him to Roach s door first and then to Dr Walker s—I did not see him taken further than the doctor s—I saw Collins carrying him away—the man I speak of is the man Collins helped to carry Cross-examined Q How old are you A Going on for thirteen years—I heard a row and came down—the row had began when I came out—the first thing I saw was Dennis Donovan attacking him—I then saw Desmond—there were about a hundred people—I saw none of the others fighting—I have known Johanna Murphy a good while—I go to school on Sunday and know the nature of an oath—this was about a quarter past eight o clock as near as I can guess—I am quite certain Murphy was among them—she is the middle one—I can swear I saw her there—I did not see her above ten minutes there—I am sure I am not mistaken—I know her from others Q If ten people were to come forward and tell you were mistaken they would all tell a falsehood A Yes because I am positive she was there EDWARD MASEY I am a brass-founder and live at No 44 Maze Tooley-street I saw the latter part of the transaction—Mary Hurley was in the act of stamping her feet on the chest of the deceased John Cole when I came up—that was with violence—he was lying on his back on the ground at the time in no situation to resist—there did not appear any life in him merely a noise in his throat at the time—I begged of him to keep his head up—he was taken to Dr Walker s—I assisted myself to carry him part of the way—I did not know him before—he was afterwards taken to the hospital by the advice of Dr Walker—he did not appear to me to have any sort of life remaining in him—I did not observe any wounds on him—it was morally impossible to get near him—he had no jacket on—his other clothes appeared to be a sailor s dress—all the persons about him were acting against him—he did not appear to me to have any friend to protect him—I merely came out of my house on hearing the cry of Murder —It was twenty or thirty yards from where he was knocked down—I did not see him at the hospital or before the coroner—I did not know him previously Cross-examined Q You did not go beyond Dr Walker s with him A I did not go further than the end of the Maze—when I first came up he was on the ground—I saw no wounds—he was in a state of stupor apparently to me—whether it was produced by intoxication or violence I cannot say—I should think there were sixty or one hundred people or upwards DAVID CORSTOTHEN police-constable M 14 I saw nothing of this transaction—I visited the deceased in the hospital the day after this happened and while he remained in the hospital I made inquiry with a view of arresting the parties but he died and I summoned all the persons before the coroner and took them into custody after the Coroner s inquest except Dennis Donovan whom I have not been able to find—Captain Codd of the Native of Wexford saw the deceased at the hospital and accosted him as John Cole and he answered to that name—Captain Codd did not go to the hospital with me but he told me he had visited him there but I visited him at the hospital and called him John Cole and he answered me by that name—nobody in my presence spoke to him by that name—I afterwards saw him a corpse—his body was present before the Coroner—he was taken to the hospital on Sunday evening left the hospital on Wednesday morning and died on board the vessel about three o clock next afternoon—I did not go on board the vessel but Kinsey did Cross-examined Q When did you go to the hospital first A On the Monday morning—I did not ask for John Cole I asked for the sailor who had been brought in—he was in bed when I saw him—he seemed to be quite lost—I had not much conversation with him—that was the first time I saw him and the only time—I was with him perhaps ten or fifteen minutes—I did not notice any wounds about him—I saw his corpse both times before the inquest—the person I saw at the hospital was the same I saw at the inquest—I addressed him by the name of John Cole at the hospital—he seemed to take very little notice—I did not see him leave the hospital JOHN KINSEY I am a constable of the Town-hall Borough I first saw the deceased on the night of the 13th of August on board the ship Native of Wexford—I heard him called John Cole but he was then dead—I did not see him before his death—I afterwards saw the body before the Coroner—I went with Captain Codd and a female to wash and lay the body out Cross-examined Q Do you know the two Desmonds A I know all the prisoners and have known them all ten or twelve years—they were always very good orderly people I believe with the exception of William Desmond who was once in trouble for being drunk and disorderly—the ship Native of Wexford was moored off St George s-stairs in the parish of St John Southwark HAROLD GILES I am a medical student of Guy s hospital On Sunday evening the 10th of August I recollect the man being brought to the hospital—I do not remember hearing him accosted by any name—I think his shipmates brought him in—I did not see Collins—I do not think I had any other case of a like description on the 10th of August—I do not recollect how he was dressed—he was in a state of insensibility and had the marks of a blow over his right eye—that was all we observed in him outwardly—he appeared to be a strong hearty man—he appeared at the time labouring under the effects of intoxication though I thought some blows which he had had might cause part of the effect—I saw him the following morning—he was sensible enough to answer questions but seemed very much inclined to sleep—he complained of pain in his head and on the Sunday evening and during the night he was sick—I did not see any thing he vomited—he was bled on the Monday and his head was relieved by the bleeding—he left the hospital on Wednesday morning without permission—he asked if he might leave the day before and was told not to leave—I saw him dead next day and examined the stale of his skull—it was not fractured at all—there was a great clot of blood at the base of the brain and the brain itself had a greater quantity of blood than was natural—there was sufficient coagulated blood on the brain to cause his death—it appeared to arise from the rupture of some vessel in the scalp there was rather an extensive bruise and extravasation of blood—I think the blow which caused that was very likely the cause of the extravasation of blood at the base of the brain—I think if he was struck and trampled on and knocked down his head coming in contact with the ground and his receiving other blows would account for the appearance I found internally—I have heard the witnesses evidence—I do not remember hearing them mention any blows on the head but there was the appearance of a blow on the head—I think the circumstance of his having a blow on the head would alone account for the appearances—I think the state of the clotted blood quite sufficient to cause death Cross-examined Q Have you been a medical student long A Six years—this is the third winter I have been at Guy s—I have a guest many cases of accidents brought in there—I am not quite certain this was the only case brought in on the evening in question—there might have been others brought in—he was not bloody when he was brought in that I swear—I saw no wounds except the one on the right eye—the bleeding he received on Monday was by the lancet—it was not fit that he should leave the hospital—we told him not to leave but he felt himself well enough to leave—we should not have permitted him to leave if we had had our own will Q If you heard of his leaving the hospital drinking rum and exposing himself to the night air would not such conduct have been sufficient to produce death A I think not unless he had received some injury before—my opinion is formed from the blood on the brain at the post mortem examination—I think most likely he would not have recovered if he had not left the hospital—I cannot be positive of that—his exposing himself to the night air and drinking rum would not be sufficient to kill him unless he had received some previous injury—he died of apoplexy but I believe it to be occasioned by the blows COURT Q In your judgment from the appearance the head exhibited and hearing the account the witnesses have given have you reason to believe his death was caused by the application of external force A I believe so—heaviness and stupor are the consequences of force causing coagulation of blood and a blow on the brain without extravasation might cause it—concussion would also produce it ROBERT GLEDSTANES CAREY I was a student of Guy s hospital at the time in question I saw the deceased on the Sunday evening—I believe him to be the same person as I saw dead before the Coroner but I could not swear to his person—he was in bed when I was called to him—he appeared labouring under the influence of liquor when I visited him—he vomited fluid which smelt of porter—sickness is one of the symptoms of concussion but I smelt porterin what he vomited but a man drinking moderately would void the contents of his stomach—I conceived he had been intoxicated—he had symptoms of stupor—he could speak and answer questions incoherently as far as I can recollect but I go principally from what he vomited—I cannot say what quantity of liquor he vomited—he vomited frequently during the night—I did not see all he vomited—I bled him at four o clock—he expressed himself considerably relieved—I believe the causes spoken to by the witnesses sufficient to produce the appearances I saw Q Do you believe death was attributable to the application of external force A That is more than I can assert—it possibly could have arisen from common causes—if he had diseased arteries this clot may have been formed—I believe the man died from the injury received but it is possible it might be from natural causes—I have no reason to suppose so—I observed a wound under the scalp—I might have covered it with half-a-crown—there were no corresponding appearances internally with that external wound—there was no coagulated blood immediately under the wound—there was a a lot the base of the brain—I should expect to find the clot of blood there—I should expect to find blood on the base of the brain if there was a blow on the vertical part of the head—that is the most common but not the invariable consequence Cross-examined Q The person of the individual you saw at the hospital and the body you subsequently examined you cannot swear to be the same A I cannot swear to it—I believe him to be the same—I did not distinguish his features when I saw him in bed—I believe him to be the same man—I certainly should not swear to him—I did not notice his features—the symptoms arising from intoxication and from concussion are very much alike—it is very difficult to distinguish—it was doubtful when he was admitted whether he was labouring under symptoms of intoxication or concussion—he could not have been on Sunday in the state which I found him in on the post mortem examination on board ship—I conceive the treatment he received at the hospital might enable him to walk about a day or two afterwards—the exertion of walking from the hospital to the ship might bring on hemorrhage and produce death—the exertion of leaving the hospital accompanied with the previous symptoms might have been the cause which produced his death—he had symptoms both of concussion and drunkenness when he came to the hospital—the clot of extravasated blood on the base of the brain was the immediate cause of death—I conceive that was from the rupture of a vessel or vessels—I conceive the wounds were kept down by our treatment bleeding and purging—I think he would have had a very fair chance of recovery if he had remained in the hospital—if he had drank to excess and had a violent fall or shake after leaving the hospital it might produce rupture of vessels—I did not take any accurate examination of the external injury when I saw him on the Sunday—we were not aware of the blow we found till we removed the scalp—I do not recollect the blow over the eye at all myself—I saw no blow whatever in the hospital nor the appearance of any that I recollect—he did not complain of any thing except the head—he was not then labouring under symptoms of fracture—I did not conceive it necessary to examine his head—I treated him the night he came in as a drunken man and on the Monday I treated him as a man labouring under a very severe headache as I supposed arising from a slight concussion of the brain—it is extremely difficult to distinguish between drunkenness and concussion—I had no reason to suppose he was mortally injured on the Sunday—I cannot undertake to say that he was mortally injured when I saw him on the Monday COURT Q When he received the blow you discovered on removing the scalp are you of opinion that it caused the coagulated blood on the base of the brain A I conceive so if it was sufficiently severe it would produce that consequence—it was not a severe one—I found the blood in the place I should naturally expect to find it if a blow was inflicted on the vertical part of the brain—it is not usual to find the blood exactly under the place injured unless it is fractured—it is sometimes on the opposite side sometimes at other places but not immediately contiguous JOHN HENRY I am a surgeon living in Gainsford-street I did not examine the person of the deceased internally—I was sent for on board the ship on Wednesday the 9th of August by Captain Codd saying that one of his men was very ill—he was dead when I went on board—his body was before the Coroner afterwards—I made no examination of it—I was examined at the inquest—assuming the facts to be true that the witnesses have deposed to I certainly am not of opinion they were calculated to produce the appearances described—a blow on the vertical part of the head is not likely to produce extravasation of blood on the base of the skull not from what I heard on board the ship—his death might or might not be from drunkenness—if the man was knocked down I certainly should attribute the blows he received to external injury—I had heard he had been drinking three or four days previous to this happening Cross-examined Q Supposing him to be in health but drunk and that he much excited in a quarrel received a slight blow could you distinguish whether he died from the injury which the last witness calls slight or from drunkenness A On examining the man on board the ship I did not see any appearance of injury—I should be able to distinguish the two cases very easily—I did not discover any external injury whatever COURT Q You never examined the injury which was discovered by the removal of the scalp A Certainly not I was not at the post-mortem examination John Desmond s Defence I am not guilty of any thing of the kind William Desmond s Defence I am not guilty of any thing of the kind Hannah Donovan s Defence I had nothing to do with it Mary Hurley s Defence I had nothing to do with it Johanna Murphy s Defence I am not guilty SARAH BARNETT I live in Boarded-entry Gravel-lane I know Johanna Murphy —I was in her company on he 10th of August at half-past five o clock in the afternoon at her father s house—I dined at her father s house in Tooley-street Borough—we left her father s at half-past five to go to my own house—we remained about an hour at my house and then went out again and met with some of her friends and her uncle at the Rull public-house right opposite our house—I went to the Bull with her and remained there till about half-past nine—Ann Sheen Catherine Neale Elizabeth Harrigan Timothy Crawley Jeremiah Crawley and Kate Crawley were at the Bull public-house that night—we got there about half-past six o clock and were in and out till half-past nine—she left her bonnet and shawl at my house and then came for it—she was about two hours running in and out from my house to the Bull just over the way—there was not time for her to go to the Maze in Tooley-street and assist in doing any violence—she was not a quarter of an hour out of my sight during that period—I could see her every minute along with her uncle Jeremiah Murphy COURT Q Where does the prisoner Johanna Murphy live A In the Maze with her father and mother John and Catherine Murphy—I met her first at her father s house that day—we were in the Maze at one o clock in the afternoon and left it at half-past five o clock—I dined there and had a cup of tea before I came away—it was on Sunday the 10th—I attended before the Coroner but it is such a long time ago I cannot recollect when—I did not hear the news till a week almost—the girl did not have the summons till the Friday and I did not hear of it till then—I know it happened on Sunday because I went to spend the afternoon at her father s house and I have no time to go out except Sunday—I work hard all day—I believe it was a week before I attended before the Coroner but I cannot not exactly say—I went before the Coroner a week after and I dined at her father s—it was on Monday I went before the Coroner—eight days after I dined at her father s—her uncle was at the Bull—he lives in the Boarded-entry the same place as I do—he was at the public-house and a little in liquor—she went to try to get him home but could not he was so obstinate—she was two hours or more at the Bull in and out backwards and forwards—she was with her friends Daniel Harrigan Kate Crawley and Ann Sheen—they had been to a funeral and met there—the prisoner had not been to the funeral—her friends had and they came to the Bull to see Jeremiah Murphy and came home with her—I am no relation of hers only an acquaintance ANN SHEEN I am the wife of Jeremiah Sheen and live in Magdalen court Tooley-street On a Sunday in August I went to the Bull public-house in consequence of a funeral—I cannot tell what day of the month it was—I cannot tell how long ago—the prisoner Johanna Murphy happened to be there—I cannot tell the time of the day I went there—I noticed the clock it was nine o clock—that was the first time I went into the house—I saw the prisoner Johanna Murphy there and my son and son-in-law Daniel Harrigan—Timothy Crawley is my son s name and my daughter s name is Honora Crawley—only her husband s name is Harrigan—she is married to Harrigan—Jeremiah Murphy the prisoner s uncle was there tipsy—we left the Bull about a quarter to ten o clock—Johanna Murphy was there then and parted with me at London bridge at a quarter to eleven o clock—she was in my company till then—I did not hear of the man being killed in the Maze till the day after—it was the day before that that I was with those persons—I do not know what time in the afternoon I came to the Bull only I said It is nine o clock it is almost time to be home for I will stop no longer —I had not been there three minutes when it was nine o clock COURT Q How long did you stay after making that observation that it was time to go A I dare say not longer than half an hour after and after leaving I never went into a house till I came to my place—I came straight on to London bridge—when I came into my own place I looked at my clock and it was a quarter to eleven o clock—I was from half-past nine to a quarter to eleven o clock walking from Ratcliffe-highway to Tooley-street—two daughters of mine and my son-in-law came with me—Timothy Crawley Daniel Harrigan and his wife Catherine Neale and Johanna Murphy—they all left the public-house at the same time with me and walked home with me to Tooley-street—we had all kept together till a quarter to eleven o clock—never went into a house—my daughter Honora Harrigan went into the Bull with me—my husband was there before I went in—my daughter and I had been to a funeral walking after a baby—she heard her husband was at this public-house and went in there—I had not been in the Maze that day—the funeral was in Ratclifte-highway—we left home at three o clock to go to the funeral and got to it about four o clock—I cannot say how long I was in attendance on it—I went to where the baby was buried and had tea there—it was in Wapping down at Ratcliffe-highway—my brother-in-law and the friends who followed the baby were there—Honora Harrigan and me and Catherine Neale a daughter of mine—none of the people I found at the Bull were at the funeral except Honora and myself—my daughter Honora is very bad confined to her bed and has been so three days—she is in a dying state CATHERINE NEALE I am the wife of Owen Neale and am a distant relation to Johanna Murphy I cannot tell what relation—I am Mrs Sheen s daughter—I have a sister named Honora Harrigan—she has got a baby very bad—I cannot say whether she is confined to her bed from illness—I have not seen her for the last week but I hear that her baby is very ill—I live at No 12 Bull-court Tooley-street—I went to a funeral at Wapping—I cannot tell the day of the month—it was on a Sunday about fourteen or fifteen weeks ago—I went in the afternoon between two and three o clock—my sister Honora and my mother were there—it was about twenty minutes to eleven o clock when I came home to Tooley-street—I cannot say what time I came from the funeral—I was at the Bull public-house in New Gravel-lane—I got there I believe about twenty minutes to nine o clock—that was before I went home—my mother and sister and her husband went with me—I found my brother Timothy Crawley my sister s husband and Johanna Murphy there and another woman named Mrs Sweeney—it was about ten minutes to nine o clock as near as I can guess—the Bull is about two miles and a half from the Maze as near as I can guess—I came away from the Bull about ten minutes to nine o clock and when I got into the Highway it struck ten o clock—I had been in the Bull the whole of the time—they all came out from the Bull together—Johanna Murphy came after—my husband and I came together—some were before and some behind—Johanna Murphy did not go away for five minutes from the time I went into the public-house COURT Q Who were the party who went from the Bull home to Tooley-street A My sister Honora Harrigan her husband my brother my husband and I and my mother—my mother and sister my brother my sister s husband and my husband and myself were at the funeral—we did not all come into the Bull together—my husband my brother and Harrigan went in before us—I believe about an hour before—I drank tea where the corpse was—the mourners drank tea there—my brother was not there nor my husband—they all went to the funeral but not as mourners—my husband and I came into the Bull together—my mother and sister were in before me but Harrigan and my brother were in there about an hour and a half before us Q Had you any conversation with the prisoner Johanna Murphy that night A No when I saw her at the Bull I said Good gracious what brought you

came home at twenty minutes to eleven o clock—my brother came in and said there had been a great row in the Maze and next morning I heard the man was killed—on the Monday morning a person came and told me Johanna Murphy was in it—I said Well she is quite innocent if every body is as innocent as she is the man would be alive now MR CLARKSON Q In your country is there any distinction between dead and killed A Yes a great difference I do not know whether they said he was killed or not—I had not heard he was dead when I said he would be alive if no one had any thing more to do with it than Murphy—we do not mean a person to be alive when he is killed DANIEL HARRIGAN My wife s name is Honora She is well but she has a sick child ill with the measles—her mother saw her to-day MARY ANN ROACH My husband keeps the Red Lion in the Maze in Tooley-street I saw John Cole about a fortnight before his death—I saw him on Sunday the 10th when there was a row in the Maze—on the Wednesday morning after that I saw him at my public-house I believe it was between nine and ten or about ten—I asked him how he was—he said he was quite well except a tightness in his knee—he had a small glass of gin in a tumbler of spring water—he appeared quite well only complained of his knee—he walked rather lame-—he did not complain of his head in the least—he said he thought the stiffness in his knee was

stood at the Red Lion door and saw three or four sailors come out of the Red Lion—I can swear to four—Desmond was standing opposite the Red Lion smoking his pipe against a warehouse belonging to Mr Humphries—one of the sailors said Come on my lads here he is —he swore with an oath he would take old Desmond s day-lights from him—he said Here he is come on so help me God I will take his day-lights from him —Old Desmond did nothing at all to them while I saw them—Young Desmond was standing by his father—I had not observed either him or his father do any thing to the sailors before they used the expression I have named—I do not know the sailors—to the best of my opinion the man who used the expression was the worse for liquor—the tallest of the sailors hit Desmond—they crossed the street to him—I cannot exactly swear to what followed afterwards because there was a crowd of people and I could take no notice—another sailor a shorter one tackled young Desmond who told them to go about their business—he would have nothing at all to do with them—old Desmond staggered against the wall from the effect of the sailor s blow but did not fall—his pipe fell on the pavement and was broken—there was a mob and I could not swear to what happened afterwards—young Desmond had not done any thing to either of the sailors—I cannot tell what caused the disturbance—I did not see old Desmond strike any body—I cannot describe any thing further —SMITH I am the wife of a City police-officer and live at No 6 in the Maze On the night of the row I was at my own door—I know all the prisoners extremely well—I saw the beginning of the row—the first of it was one of the sailors came and spoke to the prisoner Johanna Murphy s mother and he asked her where her husband was—neither of the prisoners were there at the time—I was not at my door during the whole of the row—the sailors who began the piece of work pushed the prisoner Hannah Donovan—neither of the prisoners were there at first but Mrs Donovan was coming by to go into her own house and the sailors pushed her—the prisoners were on the spot during the quarrel—I did not see Johanna Murphy there at all—I saw the other four—Johanna Murphy lives quite close to the spot—her mother s name is Catherine—I had seen Johanna Murphy about five o clock that afternoon opposite my door in the Maze—there was another female with her—I did not see any thing happen to the man—I was not present when the man was carried off senseless—I know nothing about that—I saw a great disturbance but did not see what caused the man s death—I saw no part of that particular transaction where the man was knocked down and carried away—I did not see the end of it—it was a general fight—I did not go from my own door—I did not see him taken to the hospital—I did not see him injured at all nor any blows struck on the man—I did not see him on the ground—there was a great crowd JOHN DESMOND— GUILTY Aged 51 — Transported for Seven Years WILLIAM

t18370918-2163  2163 JOHN HENNESSEY alias Curtain was indicted for feloniously killing and slaying Margaret Hennessey MR JONES conducted the Prosecution ELLEN PRICE I am the wife of James Price a tailor lodging in Caroline court Saffron-hill The prisoner and his wife lived in the same house—I remember seeing the prisoner in his room in bed in August last—his wife got the dinner ready and afterwards called to him—he told her to get it ready and she did and when it was ready he told her to bring it into the room and he would eat it in bed—she did so—he was eating his dinner and there was some words between them—she wanted him to get up to dinner and he would not—he rose up the knife to strike her—she rose her hand up to save her face and received the knife in her wrist—he was eating his dinner with the knife in his hand—it was a very small cut but it bled very severely just on the wrist—he struck her more than once there but not with the knife—she afterwards left the room and went into the other room—he got out of bed followed her and struck her over the eye which gave her a black eye and cut her eyebrow—he struck her with his fist—she was sitting down when he struck her and she fell off the chair from the blow into the corner of the room—he put one of his hands on her mouth took her by the hair of her head with the other hand raised her head up by the hair and knocked it down against the floor—he was two or three minutes beating her on the floor and kneeling on her stomach—she screamed dreadfully before he put his hand on her mouth—he had his hand round her throat—I do not know whether he was pressing or pinching it but I saw his hands round her throat—she screamed dread fully before that but that prevented her calling out—she got up and made towards the window to open it and broke a pane of glass—he then took hold of her round her waist threw her down in the corner of the room and got her to go into the other room—her gown was all over blood and he got the gown off her—he laid her on the bed and took it off himself over her head by great force—nothing else took place that night that I know of—I saw them next morning they were up in the room—they both got up before me in the morning and she told me something but he was not present—I did not see him do anything to her that morning—he was two or three seconds kneeling on her chest—she appeared distressed about it—she complained of being very bad in her right side that there was something prevented her drawing her breath—she was able to use her right arm but the morning before she died she could not lift her child out of bed and asked me to do it for her—this was on the Tuesday morning a week after the treatment happening and she died that night—she appeared in a bad state all the time till she died—I saw her every evening when I came in from work—she did not keep her bed but appeared ill—I returned to the house on Tuesday evening the 15th and saw her dead Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Did you see the prisoner then A Yes—he did not appear to be sorry to me—he seemed to keep it very silent and let nobody know of it—about two hours after I went into the room he came into the other room and said it was a queer thing and that he was very sorry—he did not have much to say to any of us—he did appear in sorrow but he seemed very silent—they had lived together comfortably in general from what I saw—I cannot tell whether he struck her with the knife on purpose or by accident—I do not know whether it was intentionally done—she was speaking to him and provoked him a little and he took up the knife with his hand he intended to strike her in the face but she received the blow in the wrist—I knew nothing of them only while they lodged there which was going on for three months—I saw some blood on her face—I wished to wash her face and bind the wound up but she was not willing to have it bound up—he wanted her to take her gown off and have another on but she wanted to go out with that gown on to have him taken up MR JONES Q Did you ever know them quarrel before A No—I did not know at that time whether she bled from any other part than the wrist—the blood on the face came from the eyebrow—it bled a little—that was done from a blow of his fist HANNAH CONNOR In August I lived in the same court with these people—I have known them about five months—on Sunday the 6th of August I saw them quarrelling about two or three o clock—I saw the prisoner hitting her and give her a blow on the forehead with his fist—he gave her tow or three blows and she fell on the floor—I saw him kicking her on her legs—that was on Monday the 14th of August the day before she died—he was going to work at six o clock in the morning—it was at their own house—I was at my window with my baby in my arms—I heard the woman scream and raised up the window—she said Bad luck to you you have done me now for ever —he turned back and said Don t give me a bad wish on Monday morning and he kicked her in her leg—she screamed and hollooed and called my name—I came down and gave her a light—he pulled her into the passage and then into the room and then she screamed out again—he locked the door and would not let anybody in—I was in my shift and flannel petticoat—he went away—they were both inside the room when he locked the door and she was screaming out—I stopped in my passage and saw him go out to work—she then came out and sat down on her step and began to cry—I went over to her and she threw up blood—that was not five minutes after he was gone—she could hardly speak to me when she threw the blood up—she showed roe marks on her body—all her flesh was blue from kicking and pinching—both her legs and near her ribs and her shoulders—she appeared to be very bad—while they were in the room together I heard her say to him before she said Bad luck &c that he had put his five fingers in her throat and knelt on her chest and had done her up for ever—she said that to him—the next day which was the day she died she sent me out for a half quartern of wine in the afternoon and told me to put a little drop of hot water to it which I did and gave it to her but she could not swallow it—she then appeared very ill and threw up blood again when I gave her the drink—she asked me if I would bring the Priest to her—I said I could not I had two children ill with the measles and could not go—one of her lodgers came in and she cried out again Fetch me the clergyman —she said she was dying and she could not swallow—she told me she got the injuries from her husband Q You have been speaking of the 14th of August A It was Monday—I remember seeing her on the Sunday the 6th and she was bleeding at that time—I saw her from twelve o clock till two o clock that day—he beat her like a bullock—she had a cut in her wrist that day and he gave her a blow on her forehead—he was ill-using her from twelve till two o clock—I do not know whether he was in bed—a mob was about the house and he shut the window and the door up and would not let any body in—I could not see into the room—I saw the blood and saw her bleed—her gown was full of blood Cross-examined Q Do I understand you to say on the Sunday week before she died you did not see any thing because—hefastened the door A Yes—I looked through the window and saw her bleeding like a bullock—there was nobody in the room then that I saw but him and her but I could not see for he pulled the blind down—I saw her gown torn to pieces—I went before the Coroner—I do not know whether they lived quietly together before this—I used to see them quarrelling and fighting—that was always the plan when I used to see them—when I was before the Coroner every body was talking and I had a baby in my arms so that I could not listen to my deposition which was read over to me—my baby was crying—I was listening to it but could not hear half of it—I put my cross to the paper—I cannot tell whether that paper was read over to me—I am not a scholar—I do not know my mark again—there are many marks as well as mine—it is out of my power to look at this—I cannot read nor write—I am sure I cannot tell whether this cross is mine—I do not know whether this is it or not— the deposition being read the wit ness stated in it she had known the deceased for twelve months and she and her husband lived quietly together up to last Sunday week and that she never saw him strike her except by kicking her on the knee and that not to hurt her Q Have you heard what you swore there you never saw the man kick her except just to kick her on the knee and not to hurt her—is that true or not A I said I did not see him striking her on that Monday morning and that is true COURT Q You said you saw her on Sunday the 6th and he struck her in the eye and her gown was all over blood A I did not say he struck her in the eye but I saw her bleed MR PRENDERGAST Q Do you mean to swear after having said before the Coroner that you never saw him strike her except a kick on the knee and that not to hurt her that you saw him repeatedly strike her and ill use her in every possible way A Well I will say that still—I am sure I did not say before the Coroner that they lived together quietly—I said I did not know the people only about three or four months—I heard this read over to me—I did not swear it that I know of—when I saw them they were always quarrelling and fighting COURT Q Had you seen them quarrelling and fighting before Sunday the 6th because you said you had known them twelve months and they lived quietly together till last Sunday week A I did not say twelve months because they were not in the house so long—I did not say so be fore the Coroner—they have put it down wrong MR JONES Q Is what you have said to-day true A It is CORNELIUS CARTY I lodged in Caroline-court in the same house as the prisoner and his wife for one week I went there on Tuesday night one week before she died—I saw nothing in the least unpleasant between them while I lived there—I went out early in the morning to work and saw nothing—I was at home the day she died—there was nothing the matter with her health that I know of when I went there—she was grumbling about something or other—she was not ill that I noticed of—she had a black eye when I went there and there was a little cut on the eye brow—I do not know how that came there—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—they might quarrel sometimes—I was at home on Sunday the day before his wife died—I was in bed when he went to work—I got out of bed about nine o clock—she then said she was very poorly—she was not in bed then—she was about the house—she died on Tuesday night— I was before the Coroner —when I came home on Sunday night they were quiet—I sat on a chair and sent out for a pot of beer—five of us drank it—Mr Farrell borrowed 1s of the prisoner and he told his wife to go out for half a gallon of beer—his wife took the shilling and walked out with another woman for the beer—Mrs Hennessey did not come back and Mrs Farrell told the prisoner that his wife had taken 6d out of the 1s —he said Where is she —she said she went down the hill for some snuff—she came in afterwards and he asked what she took the 6d for—she said she took no 6d —he said Yes you did and you shall give it back —he shut the door and banged her in—she up with the pot and threw it over me and another man—he caught hold of her and threw her against the bed—he took something like a small handkerchief from her he up with his fist and struck her three or four strokes with his fist on her head—that was the Sun day night before she died—I told him twenty times to behave himself—he took away the 6d and went out of the room—when I saw her on Monday morning she complained of being poorly and said her chest was sore—I walked out directly I spoke to her—when I came in to breakfast I said You had better go to the doctor s and get bled and it seems she went—the doctor came in the evening and she was not in-doors—I advised her to have medical assistance because she was grumbling and growling—the doctor met her as he went out and returned with her and bled her JOHN BREDALL I am assistant to Addington and Gibson surgeons I saw Mrs Hennessey on the Monday before she died—that was the first time I recollect seeing her—she complained of great pain in the chest and difficulty in breathing—she appeared to be suffering in that way—she pointed to just below the right breast—I examined her—there appeared an extensive inflammation in the chest—I desired her to go home and go to bed and I said would mention it to one of the principals and either Mr Gibson or myself would attend to her—I mentioned it to Mr Gibson and then went to her and bled her to about fourteen ounces and administered the usual remedies to abate the inflammation—she appeared to be very ill—I saw her next morning—she said she was in less pain than the day before—the bleeding would account for that—she appeared still very ill and died in the evening—I was present at the opening of the body—I saw the chest examined—it bore every appearance of a high state of inflammation—the whole contents of the chest were more or less inflamed and the right side more particularly—both right and left were inflamed—on removing the integuments there was the mark of an old contusion and some effused blood in the cellular membrane of the throat extravasated blood—that might be caused by external blows or injury of some sort—kneeling on the chest would be likely to create inflammation there—that would be highly probable—I do not think that inflammation was connected with pressure on the throat—I think the inflammation of the chest caused her death—there was also a broken rib—it appeared to me to have been broken before a new structure had grown up and been again broken before the union was perfect Cross-examined Q Did the fractured rib produce the inflammation in the chest A I cannot exactly say COURT Q The rib though fractured presented no rough substance that could have penetrated the lungs A No—there was no displacement of parts—the internal bleeding could not proceed from the broken rib MR PRENDERGAST Q Was there not an internal adherence of the lungs to the pleura A Yes I have heard she had been very much affected with influenza—very serious disease of the lungs has followed influenza—the adhesion was on the left side not the side the broken rib was COURT Q Do you suppose the adhesion of the pleura to have been of long standing A Yes that might render her more susceptible of injury JOHN ROWLAND GIBSON I am a surgeon and live in Holborn I at tended Mrs Hennessey for influenza about three weeks before her death from which she had perfectly recovered before her death—I saw her on the 15th and found her suffering from inflammation of the chest and throat—I observed a blackness about the right eye—it had been cut—there was the remains of a wound just above it—it appeared to have been inflicted about a week previous—I gave her advice and some medicine—on the Thursday after her death I examined the body—on examining superficially the parts of the body I found no marks of violence about the head but on dissecting the scalp from the brain there was extravasated blood between the scalp and the brain—I should ascribe that to some external violence received and from the appearance of some spots they were of different dates—on dissecting the integuments from the chest there was some extravasated blood on the right side of the throat and likewise some on the chest—on examining the chest I found that the fifth rib was fractured about two inches distant from its union with the cartilage—on opening the chest the lining of the membrane on the right side was in a state of inflammation—the lungs were likewise inflamed and of a darker colour than they should be—the air tubes leading from the lungs were in a state of inflammation which appeared to spread along the whole of the their ramifications till it terminated at the corner of the mouth—those appearances were quite sufficient to account for the death of the woman—there were no marks of violence on the body except those I have mentioned on the eye and eyebrow—on dissecting the integuments there were marks of violence on the right side a little behind the seat of fracture behind the fractured rib—I think kneeling on the chest would most likely break the rib in the way in which we found it broken but I think there must be some blow to account for the extravasated blood—I attribute her death to inflammation within the chest and throat—I have heard the witnesses examined—I think the account they have given quite sufficient to account for the mischief I found but I hardly think the fractured rib sufficient to produce the whole of the inflammation I found in the chest—I think blows might produce the inflammation—I have heard that several blows were given in the side but that would not sufficiently account for the appearances I saw—it is a thing we do not meet with to find such extensive inflammation arising from a single fracture of one rib Q Supposing a person thrown down on the ground struck with a fist in the side and violence of that kind A If that had been the case I should have found marks externally of such violence—I do not think they would wholly disappear after eight or nine days—I ascribe her death to inflammation within the chest and throat—I think the fractured rib caused inflammation on the right side because the inflammation round the seat of fracture was more intense than in other parts—I attribute the inflammation of the lungs to other causes such as cold—she had perfectly recovered from influenza—I am not acquainted with any other natural cause to account for the inflammation—she appeared tolerably well in other respects when I attended her for the influenza—the throwing up of blood would proceed from a ruptured vessel—it is not a common thing to proceed from external violence and I do not think it is what we should look for—I hardly think that being knocked down and knelt on or thrown violently down on the floor would of itself be sufficient to rupture a vessel Cross-examined Q Would not the adhesion of the lungs to the pleura convince you that she was a person with great tendency to some disease of that kind A It pointed out to me that there was a great disposition to inflammation—the existence of this adhesion I think proved that she had had inflammation before and therefore she might have a disposition to it again—I do not know that affections of the pleura have been very common lately—they are not uncommon certainly COURT Q We should be much obliged to you if you could tell us to what cause you ascribe the death of this woman from natural causes or inflammation arising from external violence A My belief is that the fractured rib occurred some days before the inflammation in the chest—violence some days after might produce inflammation in the chest and that inflammation might have been extended by other causes but it was first occasioned by the fractured rib—I cannot give it as my opinion that external violence alone would produce such inflammation as I found or that her death is wholly ascribable to external violence—I do not think we have any reason to suppose that inflammation would have occurred within the chest had we not had the fractured rib in the first instance to cause it and then perhaps by other causes inflammation was extended which terminated fatally GUILTY Aged 29 —

t18380820-1794  1794 WILLIAM LAW was indicted for feloniously killing and slaying James Ginns MR RYLAND conducted the Prosecution DANIEL WINCH I am a gardener and live at Walthamstow On Wednesday the 20th of June I was at the Crooked Billet at Walthamstow fetching water from there about six or seven o clock in the evening—I saw the deceased James Ginns there—I did not know him before—he was sitting down on a bench outside the house alone with a pot of porter by his side—I saw the prisoner who I knew before by sight standing in front of the deceased within two or three feet of him—I did not hear the deceased say any thing to him but the prisoner told him he saw some lice crawling about him—the deceased said if he was lousy it was unknown to him—he was an old man between seventy and eighty—that was all I heard pass then—I went away with my water and came back again a few minutes and the old man was then standing and the prisoner was standing before him—I saw the prisoner strike him twice on his face with his fist—they were talking at least the prisoner was blowing him up calling him a dirty old fellow and telling him again about being lousy—I did not hear the old man say any thing nor see him do any thing nor offer to strike the prisoner at all—the prisoner hit him most violently on the nose and on the cheek—after that the old man went away for half an hour or an hour and came back again-as I was in my own yard I saw him walking away from the Crooked Billet and the prisoner came behind him caught him by his shoulder turned him round and threw him down-whether it was done by his foot or how I cannot tell but the old man laid there and was not able to get up—he was carried to his seat by two or three people and the prisoner either went into the tap-room or stood against the door—I afterwards saw the old man at the hospital—I am sure it was the same man—the prisoner was rather the worse for liquor but not drunk—he knew what he was doing JAMES PATMORE I am a labourer and live at Chapel-end Walthamstow On the 20th of June I went to the Crooked Billet late at night and found Ginns sitting on the seat outside the door between seven and eight o clock—he appeared very bad and could not move off the seat-a young man took and carried him into the stable and a surgeon was sent for who came and ordered him to be taken to the hospital—I assisted the young man in carrying him to the hospital—we started about twelve o clock at night—I afterwards saw him dead—it was the same man—I knew his name to be James Ginns—I never saw him before COURT Q Did you notice what state his thigh was in A No he could not walk—we put him into a spring cart and carried him to the hospital—he complained very much going along and said he never had such a hurt before and he knew he should never get over it—he said he knew his hip must be broken as he could not move his leg and he was sure it would be the death of him THOMAS GOODWIN I am a police-sergeant On the night of the 20th of June I heard of this and went to the Crooked Billet—I got there about half-past eleven o clock—the deceased had been removed to the hospital then—I found the prisoner in the hay loft about ten minutes after and took him into custody I told him the charge—he said he was sorry he had done so—he appeared to be under the influence of liquor—he said he had been a very unlucky fellow he was always in trouble but he hoped this case would transport him—this was as he was going to the House of Correction after being committed—I asked him before the Magistrate if he had been in custody before and he said he had—he was brought down from the hay loft by Carbun who went with me and given into my charge—I took him to the cage HENRY CHILD I am a journeyman painter at Walthamstow On Wednesday the 20th of June I was at the Crooked Billet between six and seven o clock and saw the deceased there sitting outside drinking a pint of beer—I never saw him before—he did not appear the worse for liquor—I went into the tap-room and saw the prisoner there—the tap-room window opens out to where the old man was sitting—I heard the prisoner ask him to give him some beer—I did not hear the old man make any reply-short time after the old man stood up and the prisoner came out of the tap-room and struck him twice in the face—I had heard nothing more pass between them before he went out—the prisoner took the old man s stick away from him—he walked with a stick as he was infirm—I did not have any thing said by the old man before the prisoner struck him nor after—he got his stick back again some time after and was going away—the prisoner followed him after he got about twenty yards away from the house went behind him took hold of his collar tripped him up with his foot and threw him up—he fell sideways on his thigh or hip I cannot say which—he appeared to fall very heavy—after he fell he told the prisoner he ought to be ashamed of himself for striking an old man—he said he was quite sure that either his thigh or hip was broken—the prisoner went back again to the house—he was a little the worse for liquor Q Did anybody interfere to take the part of the old man while these blows were struck A Yes a young man named Fenn after he struck him first came and stood before him—he tried all he could to keep the prisoner off but he made shift to hit him again in spite of Fenn being between them—I and a young man took the deceased up and carried him on to the form where he had been drinking his beer—he could not get up himself—he could not move—we carried him on to his seat and there left him—the old man fell on the gravel in the road facing the house-fell hard—he did not from first to last make any resistance to the prisoner nor do any thing to provoke him Prisoner Q Did you see me kick the old man with my foot A Yes—I do not know whether you kicked him-you made use of your right leg when you knocked him down JOHN ADAMS I am an assistant-surgeon at the London Hospital I saw the deceased James Ginns at the hospital on the morning of the 21st of June about eight or ten hours after he was brought there—I did not see him at the time he was brought in—he had got a broken thigh bone—that was all the injury I could see—he lived about seven weeks and died from mortification in consequence of the broken bone-every thing was done for him in the hospital that possibly could be done—the fracture was in all probability the effect of a fall—I examined the body after death more particularly—I observed that the thigh bone was broken very high up close to the hip and there was mortification and abscess around it to a considerable extent and one portion of the bone was driven into the other—the mortification was quite sufficient to occasion death—the setting of the thigh was attended to by two pupils who superintend the accidents in the night-I saw it in the morning—it had been attended to and put in a proper position-every thing had been done that could be done—I attribute his death solely on the mortification which was the result of the broken bone-a younger man would in all probability have escaped but at his time of life it was lot at all probable—I watched him very closely almost from day to day till he died—the breaking of the thigh bone so high always implies a great deal of force—the thigh bone had been properly set before I saw it and every thing had been done that was required-a very vigorous constitution night got well under it—I learnt his name was James Ginns at the time of the inquest—the Magistrate Mr Davis attended the deceased at the hospital before his death—he is not here—I do not know his handwriting—I did not address the deceased by the name of Ginns nor did I near anybody else do so-but the name of every patient is taken when they come into the hospital and written over their bed and his name was over in bed—he had friends come to see him I believe—I cannot swear what came was over the deceased s bed but a name is invariably put over a patient s bed WILLIAM GARRETT I am a constable of Whitechapel I was bound over to prosecute—I do not know the deceased s name except by the warrant sent me by the Coroner—there is a porter kept at the door of the hospital to take the name and particulars of every patient that comes in—he was not bound over—the deceased gave me the name of James Ginns THOMAS GOODWIN re-examined During the man s illness I received two different certificates with the name of James Ginns one signed by Mr Andrews and the other by Mr Adams—I know Mr Davis the magistrate s hand-writing—this name to this statement is his hand-writing—I was not present when it was made MR ADAMS re-examined I have no doubt I gave that certificate—I will not be certain the name of James Ginns is the book but I have not a doubt of it DANIEL WINCH re-examined I did not know the old man before—he was a perfect stranger to me—I heard a man named Cox a shoemaker peak to him that evening by the name of James Ginns and he answered to that name-Cox told me he had known him about twenty years—he sold me his name was James Ginns—the deceased heard that Prisoner s Defence The old man hit me with his fist and I hit him on his face—he told me he would get me taken into custody—I told him I could not help it—I asked him first of all to go further away from me because he was lousy but he would not—that was before he hit me-when he hit me I hit him again and as he was going away I gave him a shove and he fell down GUILTY * Aged 20 — Transported for Seven Years 
t18430821-2237  2237 JOHN BENJAMIN FACEY was indicted for killing and slaying Eliza Slater SARAH SLATER I am single and twenty-three years old I have cohabited with a young man for two years and live at 49 Went worth-street Spitalfields in the same house as the prisoner who I have known since last Christmas—he gets his livelihood by begging in the streets going out shallow which means nearly naked—I have seen him go out begging not in the clothes he wore at other times—he was in prison for a month—he came out and was there a month after—my sister died on Wednesday the 26th of July—he had lived with her some time and for four or five weeks in that house—on Tuesday night the 4th of July I was in my room about ten o clock preparing to go to bed—my sister came up stairs and sat down—the young man who lives with me was at work in the room—Eliza was eighteen years old—she sat down in a chair—the prisoner came up in about five minutes said he had been fighting and had a cut under his eye—he called my sister a b—w— up with his foot and kicked her out of the chair—other words passed which I do not remember for I was very ill and it did me a deal of harm—he up with his foot and immediately kicked my sister at the bottom of the stomach—she laid nearly half an hour on the ground senseless—it appeared a very hard kick—I gave her a little water but he would not allow any one to touch her—he gave her no assistance—she came to in about half an hour and said he had done her a great deal of harm she felt dreadfully from the kick—she said Jack you will be the death of me through this kick —I do not remember what he said I was so agitated—I led her into the next room to her bed—she did not walk very well—she came into my room next morning and had a cup of tea—the prisoner was not with her—she appeared in great pain and complained of pain at the bottom of her stomach—he took her out begging that day as usual—he was obliged to return in the evening—she was in such violent pain in the same place I sent my other sister for Mr Smith the doctor—I begged of the prisoner to send for a doctor and it was agreed she should fetch him—he ordered mustard and bran poultices which I applied—he took her out again the next day or the day after—she kept her bed a little the day after having the poultice then went out and he brought her home very ill—she was obliged to keep to her bed for a week and went out with him afterwards—she returned in dreadful pain and a deal of blood passed from her from the same place—I saw that—he took her out after that again for some days—she always returned in great pain for a week or fortnight and about a week before she died she took to her bed—she died on the 26th of July about a quarter past nine at night—the prisoner came in a little before eight o clock that night and about an hour before he came in my sister Esther who was attending to her called me down into the room where Eliza was—she said Sarah I have something to reveal —she was in great pain and was praying—my sister Esther was present and my sister Sophia—she is now at home at her mother s—Esther had been reading to her—I did not bear her but she had a testament and prayer-book in her hand—Eliza said that she found she was going—I begged of her if she had got anything to name to me to name it—she appeared to consider herself as dying—she asked me to call the landlady of the house in as a witness to what she had got to say—the landlady would not come and I called John Robinson and the young man I live with—she then said Sarah I have something to tell you before I die for I cannot rest happy without but the kick I received in your room has been my death —I asked her if I should name it to her mother—she said Yes —she said that the prisoner wanted her to lay it on a blow in the breast from a man they called Black Jack and she was afraid to divulge it till she found death so near as she was afraid of the prisoner—she seemed to want to be moved from where she was out of the prisoner s sight into my room but we durst not move her—she saw the prisoner after telling me this but said nothing to him—I said to her in his presence Eliza I will let your request be known to your mother what you have confessed to me — meaning about the kick —she said Do —she asked me to pray by her which I did and that was the last she uttered till she died—Mr Byles and Mr Hart attended her and opened her body after death Prisoner She said at Worship-street that she divulged this an hour before she died and now she says it was an hour before I came in she has spoken wrong all throughout The only one that would speak the truth a modest girl of sixteen is kept at home These girls are prostitutes and the two men who live with them are supported by their prostitution She never saw me begging Witness What I have said is true I have seen him going out begging and putting on begging clothes Prisoner Q Was she sitting down when I kicked her A Yes on the chair—she was senseless for nearly half an hour Prisoner How could I kick her there without leaving a mark nothing of the kind took place I was too much intoxicated Witness He was not intoxicated he paid for some medicine for her afterwards HENRY TEMPLE I am a shoemaker and live with the last witness in the back room of 49 Wentworth-street—the prisoner lived there and cohabited with the other sister Eliza—on Tuesday night the 4th of July I was in my room with the last witness—Eliza came in first and then the prisoner came in—he went and stood over the fire-place—he was not drunk—he might have had a little to drink but not much—he said to the deceased You b—w—it is you that has got me into this row —she said How did I get you into the row Jack —he said You b—b—h you did get me into the row and he up with his foot and kicked her at the bottom of the stomach—she fell down on the ground senseless and remained on the ground pretty well half an hour—while she was on the ground he said You b—wh— if I come to you I will pretty soon make you get up —I got up to go to her and he said Harry you shall not touch her —he would not let me help her up—I sat down to my work and after she came to she got up went into the next room where she lived and went to bed—on the day she died about an hour before she died I was called down stairs—her three sisters were there and she was in bed—she said The kick that Jack gave me in the chair up in your room was the cause of my death —Robinson was there he came down with me—she appeared to know she was dying at the time she said this—she was living down stairs then Prisoner It is quite false—he has a malice against me—I took Eliza out of the streets and they took her away from me and wanted her to prostitute herself—Mr Broughton said he could see it was a conspiracy from what this man said Witness The account I have given is true—I am not stating this from any malice towards him JOHN ROBINSON On the 26th shortly before the deceased died I was sent for into the room and found her her three sisters and Temple there—I heard Sarah say to her Now Eliza you are very near your death —she said I know I am Sarah now I will speak the truth I did say it was Black Jack I said that through fear it was not Black Jack it was through the kick I received up in your room on Wednesday —I remained till she died—this was said a very short time before she died—I was with her about an hour before she died Prisoner This man said at Worship-street that I was in Newgate twice and had six months each time which I defy any one to prove Witness I said it in this way—before I was examined the prisoner said You must not hear that man he has been in Newgate —I said I have never been in Newgate—he has made a common boast that he has had two six months and I think his name would sooner be found there than mine —I am a weaver by business—what I have said is true Prisoner He has been convicted from this bar and is well known at Cold Bath-fields Witness I never was in Newgate in my life THOMAS HITCHEN On the 4th of July I saw the prisoner and Black Jack fighting together at our house The deceased was there and she received a shove from Black Jack with the back of the hand—he said Get out of the way Eliza and don t you interfere —I don t consider it was a blow—it was not a violent blow that might have occasioned her death—he pushed I her away with the back of his hand Prisoner He is afraid to say more for fear he should be turned away for Black Jack is a lodger in the house Witness That I deny in toto HENRY PEDLEY I am a starch-manufacturer and am a Wesleyan Methodist On Tuesday night the 25th of July about a quarter to nine o clock the day before the deceased s death I went to 49 Wentworth-row and found her in bed—she was in a dying state and appeared to be conscious she was dying—I asked her how she was—she said she was very ill she was dying—I asked her how matters stood between God and her soul—she said she was a great sinner and desired salvation—the prisoner was not then present—Esther told me that her sister was murdered—I asked Eliza how she came by her end—she told me that some time previous Jack meaning the prisoner was in a row along with a fellow called Black Jack and he was going to strike him she went in between and caught the blow herself on the lower part of her stomach—she said she felt the effects of the blow to the present time that it caused a miscarriage that she went out shallowing or begging the day after she miscarried and caught cold and that was the cause of her death—Esther said to me several times after this passed that Eliza had got some more to say she heard that—I went to the bedside and asked her—she said she had got no more to say she had given me the whole state of her mind respecting the blow that caused her death—I saw her again about a quarter to eight next morning—I asked her whether her mind was the same—she said yes—she told me that her sisters requested her to say something more that was not the truth but she had given me the whole state of her mind respecting her death and she had got no more to say—Esther told me in her hearing that Jack meaning the prisoner was the cause of her death—she said that one way in which he was the cause of her death was at the time he was living with her he had been along with bad girls and caught the bad disorder and had given it to her and she was then dying rotting on her bed—Eliza told me that if her sisters would but let her alone she should die easy but they were quite a torment to her by agitating her mind—that was the principal of what passed between us—she appeared perfectly sensible—the first time Esther told me the prisoner had murdered her I asked her how and she said she was sure she did not know—the prisoner had then left the room—he had been there before—when I first entered the room he was there—that was the first day THOMAS BURCHAM police-constable K 33 I apprehended the prisoner in a public-house in the Mint in the Borough—I told him to come out—he said What for —I said The woman you lived with is dead the Coroner has issued out a warrant for your apprehension —he said I did not do it it was done in a scuffle in a beer-shop black Jack hit her in the breast ESTHER SLATER I am twenty-one years of age and am sister of the deceased—I lived at home with my mother I went to the house in Wentworth-street about three weeks before Eliza was taken ill on account of Sarah being ill—I was with Eliza the night she died—I was there on the Tuesday evening and remained all day on Wednesday—she was aware she was dying—two or three hours before her death she said Is my eldest sister here —I said She is up stairs —she said she had something heavy on her mind and she could not die without she revealed it—I asked her what she had got to say—she said First call them all down —I called them all down into the room—when they came she said The kick he gave me up in your room Sarah was the cause of my death the brutish treatment I have met with from him no one knows —that was said about four o clock in the morning when we were alone when they were all there—she said Jack Facey had been the cause of her death the kick he had given her—after they went up stairs she said For God s sake take me up to my sister s room —I asked her whether she was happy—she said I have one thing to say let me be removed into my sister s room for God s sake —at that time she was in her own room—I asked why she wanted to be removed—she said that the prisoner had threatened her so that he said he would be her murderer if she told us any thing about him if she told any of her sisters—about four o clock in the morning the prisoner was lying in one corner of the room asleep on a drugget—she rose up in bed and asked to be removed to him—he instantly placed himself against the window and said No I shall not remove you and called her a bad name—I was sitting with her and said Never mind dear lay down —the prisoner placed himself against the door and said Oh I wish I had had three months instead of one this job would never have happened Prisoner She says she was only there three weeks before her sister died she was there three or four months and Mrs Fleming who keeps the house turned her out because she was out so late * * * Witness I had only been there three weeks and had not been in the house before—I had been to my sister sometimes in the morning and went home to my mother s to sleep—I have only left service six months at Mr Matheson s in the City—Mrs Fleming did not turn me out because I was out late at night—I never kept indecent hours—she never turned me out—she said she would turn him out for running a knife across her throat when she was taking medicine COURT Q Why not state before the Magistrate the conversation which you say occurred at four o clock in the morning A I did not think it requisite—I answered the questions I was asked SAMUEL BYLES I am a surgeon in partnership with Mr Hart I attended the deceased—I first saw her about the 21st of July in bed at No 49 Wentworth-street—she was then labouring under inflammation of the bowels quite at its advanced stage—I prescribed what I thought available but I had no doubt at that time that gangrene had already commenced and that no remedial treatment would do that it was a hopeless case—I visited her every day till the Wednesday on which she died—I think she was aware that she would die for three or four days before her death—she clearly knew that she was dying on the Sunday—I was rather surprised to see such indications of so severe a disease in so young a person—I thought there must be something beyond the ordinary symptoms of disease and asked her on the Sunday if she had been the subject of any violence—I should not expect such symptoms in such a subject unless from violence—she seemed to consider her case quite hopeless and that she should die very speedily—she seemed to be quite in a desponding state of mind—I believe she had been told that she was in a hopeless state and that her recovery was not at all probable—she appeared aware that she was on her death-bed—she told me that she had been pushed in the breast by a black man named Black Jack in a public-house row—the prisoner was in the room at the time but said nothing—I think he was present on every occasion when I went to see her—I attended her till her death—she was so scanty of clothing that her person was observable—there was no bruise or mark on her breast—the indications of gangrene increased and she died on the Wednesday evening—I saw no marks of violence of any importance in any part of her body—there were some bruises on one leg but nothing to lead to her death—I made a post-mortem examination—I found the intestines excessively inflamed with patches of gangrene or mortification in different parts—in tracing the convolutions of the intestines downwards I arrived at the secun and it was bound down to the side by inflammation in such a way that the course of the alimentary canal was completely obstructed—it was adhering to an abscess which seemed to be connected with the ovaria—the ovaria appeared to have been lacerated and that laceration to have been followed by ulceration and an abscess had formed there and spread—the left ovaria was perfectly healthy—the womb was larger than in its unimpregnated condition but on examining it internally I found unequivocal evidence of recent abortion—I think a person in a state of pregnancy receiving a violent kick at the bottom of the stomach would probably have inflammation of the ovaria such as I saw—I can scarcely imagine that a disease at that early age would occur in that part especially as I found the left ovaria perfectly healthy—the symptoms I saw were such as would result from such a cause—I hardly think it possible they could have arisen from natural disease at that age—disease of the ovaria scarcely ever occurs till a more advanced period of life and where natural disease occurs there it is not common to find one ovaria healthy—I saw no marks of a kick or violence but I think most likely the external mark would disappear—the fact of there being no external mark does not lead me to suppose that the inflammation of the ovaria could not have been occasioned by external violence—the fall might have caused the laceration the rebound after receiving the kick—Mr Hart attended with me at the post-mortem examination and attended the patient two days before I saw her THOMAS HART I am a surgeon I was called to the deceased on Thursday the 20th of July by the prisoner—I found her labouring under disease as Mr Byles has described—I attended the post-mortem examination and coincide with Mr Byles evidence in every particular—I told the prisoner on the Tuesday evening before she died that I did not consider she would live twenty-four hours but not in her hearing—the prisoner and one of her sisters in the room told me on the Tuesday when she was nearly dying that she had something to communicate respecting the cause of her illness—I returned to the bedside and asked what it was she had to say—she made no reply which I attributed to weakness—the prisoner then said that about three weeks previously she had received a blow in the chest from a black man which had very much frightened her that she thought it had brought on a miscarriage which was the cause of her present illness—I then asked the deceased if she heard what the prisoner said and if it was true—she said it was—in the post-mortem examination we found marks of recent miscarriage—that was not likely to have occasioned the injury to the ovaria—there was an abscess in the substance of the ovaria which was not likely to have been produced by miscarriage—I do not think it at all likely that a blow or push in the chest could have produced the appearances I saw—if she had received a violent kick three weeks before that would account for the injury Prisoner s Defence On the 4th of July I was at Mr Sears s beer shop the Wonderful Man in Went worth street I got into a row with an Irishman named Carney I got the better of him and black Jack came between us and we fought the deceased came between us and he struck her in the chest I afterwards went into the back yard she was in a fit and terr or twelve persons round her in about half an hour she came to and went up stairs she went out with me next day and was taken very bad I brought her home and asked one of the sisters to go for a doctor she would not and Esther went the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered mustard and saw-dust poultices and some stuff for which I paid 18d she kept her bed that day and next day we went out over London-bridge she was taken ill again I took her into a doctor s shop he examined her and said she bad miscarried he gave her a draught and I brought her home she began to get better till the 19th of July when she was very bad again in Finsbury-pavement I bought a piece of mutton to make her some broth and a drop of wine and she went to bed I went to Mr Byles s and Mr Hart came with me they did all in their power for her breath was not out of her body five minutes before the sisters Esther and Sarah began to blackguard me and said I was a murderer and if they could they would hang me Mr Hart said on Wednesday it was her mother s wish to have her opened he did not come so I went out to try and get a subscription to bury her and when I came back they blew me up called me a murdering rascal and said she should be buried by the parish Mrs Pedley was there I got no peace and left them it is all malice against me because I would not let her walk the streets I had bad legs for some time I would not go thieving and was forced to beg to get an honest piece of bread the medical gentlemen can say she was free from any disease when she died this religious man was not called at the inquest because they thought they could have it their own way GUILTY Aged 23 — Transported for Ten Years Fourth Jury before Mr Recorder 
t18450818-1742  1742 MICHAEL CARROLL was indicted for feloniously killing and slaying James Bristow RICHARD SMITH I am a smith—I live opposite the gas-works at Old Ford On Saturday night the 10th of Aug I was at the Dog and Part-ridge at Bow—I came out there a few minutes before twelve o clock—on my road home with some friends we had a little conversation—I walked a few yards past my own door and we stood talking about some working affairs—a stone was thrown as we supposed from a window opposite and it struck a young man named Kingdom on the back of his head—Bristow was not there then—we then had to retreat from a party who interrupted us with sticks &c —we ran towards the railway arch at Old Ford—we waited there a few minutes—Bristow then came up to us in his way home—we stood at the corner of the street he was living at—Carroll had been with the party before—I do not know whether he was there at that time—I went back to go home and we had to go past the house where the disturbance took place and Carroll was walking in a kind of concealment with the poker under his coat—Thomas Smith who had been struck previous to that in passing along by himself hallooed out There is the man that struck me —I did not hear Bristow say anything—I was then about four-teen or fifteen yards from the door of the house and the prisoner was about ten yards—he was near enough to hear Smith say That is the man that struck me —as soon as he heard Smith say that he went to the door and rapped twice with the head of the poker—by that time Bristow had got a few yards past the house—I was perpendicularly opposite—Carroll seized Bristow by the collar and struck him with the poker by the side of the head—in consequence of that Bristow fell—the rest of the Irish party then chased me and those who were with me and we ran back again to the railway arch—we missed Bristow and did not see him for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes when he was coming back with two policemen—he had been to the station-house—I am sure the prisoner is the man who struck him with the poker—he had not spoken to the prisoner or to nny of them—he was smoking his pipe and when he was struck the pipe fell and the lighted ashes made the light more brilliant—the pipe fell before Bristow did Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q What had you been about at this time of night at this public-house A Taking a glass of beer like anybody else—I went in by myself—I think there were only about three or four others in the public-house—I knew them—I used to work with two of them—when the stone was thrown there was me and three others and Kingdon who got struck was just at his own door—I went into the public-house about half-past eleven o clock—I first saw Bristow after we had had a skirmish with the Irish party who came out with sticks—we ran to get away from them and we stood talking for nearly twenty minutes after before I saw Bristow—we stood talking the matter over—we were afraid to go back as there were so many of them with sticks and other things—the prisoner was not near us then—he was not in our sight—we had run from the direction of his house to the railway arch—I was nearest to Bristow when he was struck—there was Kingdon and Bristow and one or two friends—I was about half a dozen yards from the prisoner when the blow was struck and the rest of the party were about half a dozen yards behind me—just before the blow was struck we had been doing nothing but just talking the matter over—we had not done anything to him—we had no quarrel with him when the blow was struck—we had previously but Bristow was not there COURT Q At the time Bristow came up and was struck were any of you attacking the prisoner A No MR ROBINSON Q Were you saying anything to him A No the farthest of us were twelve yards from him—there was nothing said to him but Smith said That is the man that struck me —the poker was then under his coat—it was a starlight night—I did not perceive any moon—the prisoner had not been beaten or attacked till he offered to fight Joseph Williams and then he began to call out Mike —he went btck towards his own house and in less than two minutes the party was out with sticks—no one had touched Carroll but Joseph Williams—no one else laid a hand on him that I saw BENJAMIN MATTHEWS I am a bricklayer On that Saturday night about twenty minutes past twelve o clock I was in bed—I heard a noise in the street—I ran out and saw several persons with sticks and I saw the prisoner with a poker under his coat—I did not see Bristow—I went in doors JAMES MALLARD I am father-in-law to James Bristow the deceased I was at home all that day when he was brought home at night—I examined him—he was very much covered with blood and had two wounds on his head JOHN GILBERTSON I am assistant to Mr Baker a surgeon at Bow I saw the deceased about a quarter past five in the morning—he was suffering from the effects of concussion of the brain—I found two wounds on his head and from their external appearance I should say the wound over the right temporal muscle caused his death—he died about three hours after I saw him—it was his body that Mr Garman afterwards saw Cross-examined Q Where did you see him A At his own house—he had been bleeding but not very much—the blood was stopped when I saw him and I should say it had been for two or three hours—he died about eight o clock in the morning—when a person is in a state of coma as he was when I saw him the pulse is very low—it would not be right to bleed him then—a man is as if he were asleep—had he been bled at first it would probably have reduced the circulation—one of the wounds was not more than a quarter of an inch long—the one over the temple was large HENRY VINCENT GARMAN I am a surgeon I did not see the deceased till after he was dead—my impression is that the violence of the blow caused a rupture of a branch of an artery on the right side of the head which allowed a certain quantity of blood to escape and that accumulated into a clot and caused death—it was all in consequence of a blow NORTH FOLEY I am a widow and keep a greengrocer s shop I was clearing up my place and heard a screaming outside—I then opened the door to see for my children but they were inside—I closed the door and took the latch by the handle and peeped out—I saw Carroll down and a number of men beating him—the back of his waistcoat and his shirt were exposed—I did not know any of them Cross-examined Q Did you see Smith A I do not know the party—they were all strangers to me—I went out the man roused up and I knew him to be Carroll—he looked as if he bad been very well beaten—he had some marks JOSEPH WILLIAMS There was a battle—Bristow was not there at that time—I was there when Bristow first came up which was about twenty minutes after the battle—he did not strike anybody or act offensively to anybody—I did not see him struck but I saw the prisoner with a poker concealed under his coat as Bristow passed and I saw him walk over to Bristow—I did not see him strike him—I saw the prisoner go to a door and knock—some Irishmen came out with sticks—Bristow went down with me for the purpose of identifying some person who had bitten him EDWARD FULCHER I was up stairs when the first of these parties ran away—I opened the window and saw some of them come back but I do not know who—I then heard another row—I went to the door and saw Carroll with a poker—I asked him for it and he gave it me directly Cross-examined Q Whom did you see near there at the time A I do not recognize any one that I saw only Carroll—I did not see Smith there—I did not see any fight between the parties after I had taken the poker WILLIAM MORLAND I saw Carroll fight with Joseph Williams and after that these twelve or fourteen Irishmen came up with sticks at the corner of Taylor s-buildings—Bristow was not there at the time Carroll was fight-ing Williams—I am sure of that—Bristow was there about twenty minutes afterwards—I saw Carroll with a poker under his coat—I did not see him strike anybody Cross-examined Q Had you seen Carroll beaten by anybody A I saw him beating Joseph Williams—Richard Smith was there at the time—it was light enough to see who the persons were if you were pretty close to them—I saw Bristow supported along by two policemen—he lived in Douro-street I believe which is about 200 yards from where this took place WILLIAM COCKERELL police-constable K 266 I saw nothing of the fight—the prisoner was not drunk MR ROBINSON called DANIEL KEYNON Between twelve and one o clock on that Saturday night the party connected with the deceased man came to my door and Williams as far as I am given to understand knocked at my door—Richard Smith was there—they complained of people being in the front room raising the window and cutting one of their mate s heads—I saw no man with his head cut—they did not want to search my place—I saw Car-roll standing at the corner of the street with his hands in his pockets—he told the men not to be too hasty—he said the night was dark and they could not tell whether the stone came from this side or the other—they said You Irish b— what is that to you —Williams went and pulled him into the road to fight him and the others struck him with their fists—I went in and heard him singing out as if he was being violently beaten—I looked out and he appeared to have been violently beaten—Smith was in the party—there were five who came to my door—there were seven or eight persons round Carroll JOHANNA LEE I saw Carroll coming round the corner with both his hands in his pockets—there were five men kicking at Keynon s door and then they went to Carroll took his coat over his head and took his hat off—I know Kingdon was one of the men and he took his hat—I could not swear to any other of them —Davidson manager to Messrs White and Co the prisoner s employers gave him a good character GUILTY Aged 26 — Transported for Seven Years

and COOPER conducted the Prosecution ROBERT MASON I am a chandler in George-street St Giles s on Sunday afternoon 30th April I was in my shop and saw a policemancoming towards my shop—the prisoner Jerome Coakley was then standingopposite about the centre of the street—I then saw them standing near eachother and Jerome was in a sparring position opposite the policeman larking as I thought—something attracted my attention in my shop for asecond or two and the next thing I noticed was seeing them having hold ofeach other in the act of wrestling—they fell together on the ground—Iturned my eyes to my shop again and the next thing I saw was both standingup again—they had hold of each other the same as before—I afterwardssaw them both on the ground again the policeman

PRENDERGAST Q You only saw one blowgiven A That was all—I do not know what became of them after for Iturned into my shop—I was not near enough to see whether the policemanhad hold of Jerome by his throat—they were in the middle of the street—Idid not hear any one say that he was strangling the man—I am very sorryto be at all mixed up in the affair—I did not hear the crowd say that thepoliceman was ill-using the man—there might have been from half-a-dozen toa dozen people—I did not hear the policeman calling a man of the named of Sealan—I believe Patrick wished to relieve Jerome from the grasp of thepoliceman—he was on Jerome in a leaning position—I did not see where hishand was—I did not notice whether he was kneeling on him—I did not see Jerome strike the policeman—I knew Patrick before and his relatives andfriends many years as neighbours—he has been a well-behaved man up tothis time—I have known him six years—as far as I know he has been asober well-conducted man CHARLES

of George-street On Sunday 30th April about one o clock I was at myhouse and saw a policeman go past with a man in his custody who appearedto be a beggar—there had been a quantity of people standing round and one man was reading a newspaper in the middle—I did not see Jerome Coakley at that time but as the policeman returned I heard some angry wordsbetween him and Jerome Coakley and Jerome said You will not take me fornothing —the policeman turned round on his saying that and drove him backto my door—a struggle ensued they struck one another and the policemantried to catch him by the neck and they both fell down the constable undermost—they got up again and fell down again and I saw a short man in aflannel jacket strike the policeman twice with a stick while the policemanhad Jerome down with his knee on his chest and his hand in his handkerchief—I could not see who the man was but I heard the people round saythat he was the other one s brother—I know Jerome very well but not theother—I could not see where the policeman was struck there were people before me Cross-examined Q You did not see where the stick fell A No—when it did fall the policeman had Jerome down with his knee on him—Iwas looking through the window—the policeman first tried to lay hold of Jerome and drive him away—the people called the constable names fortaking the beggar—I did not see Jerome there then—they were not readingthe newspaper when the policeman had hold of Jerome—I did not see Jeromestrike the policeman until he drove him—he then turned back to a door andsaid You will not take me for nothing and struck him as he was goingto get him by the collar—I did not hear people say the policeman was stranglinghim—I did not go from the door—there was a crowd collected—I didnot hear the

the back part and the head generallywas a great deal swelled—it indicated violent blows—I should thinkthey must have been inflicted by such an instrument as a staff—erysiplelascame on five or six days after and he died on 28th May—by order of the Coroner I made a post mortem examination—I opened the skull and found afrcture or fissure and found four ounces of blood within the arachnoid membrane—the death was produced by erysipelas the consequence of the blow Cross-examined Q When did you first see him A On 2nd Mayshortly after the injury—erysipelas had not then come on—he was going onas

am headnurse at University Hospital On 5th June Peter White was brought there—he was regularly attended by the medical officers—on 30th June the day before he died he said he was fearful he should not get over it—I told him he would not and asked if he felt happy—he said Middling —I said You are well aware you are near your end —he said Yes —I asked him if he would like to see the doctor—he said he should like to recover but he thought he should die—I asked if he would like to see the chaplain—he said he should—I asked that because he was a Catholic—it was my duty to call his attention to the fact that he was dying—I believe he had the apprehension of death soon coming on him—I asked him how the wound occurred—he said his wife had done it—I asked how she came to do it—he said God knew for he had not told her to do it and the devil must that she was tipsy and be put her to bed and left her for a short time then returned and she was up and dressed he asked what she did up the reply was that she was going out he begged ber not to do so and went across the room to get a lucifer she shut the door and he wished her not to do so when she came across to him which was customary with her and caressed him his reply was then You rogue you have cut my throat and he felt blood from his throat JURY Q Did he see the Chaplain A Yes on the Sunday morning—he died that day a little after two o clock Prisoner He told an untruth at his dying hour The following statement of the deceased was here read — On the morning of that day my wife got up about seven o clock She came home about twelve with 7s 6d in her pocket She said he had not spent the money and I must come out and have a glass of gin She was very pleasing but I did not want to go out and I told her to go for it and she brought a quartern of gin We drank the gin between us and a pint and a half of beer Then she went out by herself and returned about six o clock her son brought her home beastly drunk I undressed her and put her into the bed I never said one word to her I went out then and on my return she was up and dressed I said What induced you to get out of bed She said You ll soon know that Then she said she had pawned the clock I said It s no matter and then went to look for a light and while I was feeling for a lucifer she got her arm round my forehead and said Let me have a kiss or I ll kiss you or words like them and with that she cut my throat and those are the last words I spoke except I screamed out that my throat was cut that I did they came immediately I had had nothing to drink from twelve o clock For the last fourteen years we lived together unhappily I had her at Clerkenwell for threatening to cut my throat —PETER WHITE — Sworn before me J HARDWICK CHARLOTTE TUCKER I am single and live at 13 Hertford-street Fitzroy-square Peter White lodged in the front parlour On the night of the 5th June I was in my room close by the prisoner s room and heard screams of Murder and breaking of glass—I went down and heard Peter White say For God s sake make haste for my wife has cut my throat —I tried to open the door—it was locked—I went for the police—I had seen the prisoner and him drinking together about six o clock—she seemed quite tipsy—they lived very quarrelsome—I have seen her strike him several times—he was about fifty-four years of age and was in good health WILLIAM GOLDEN police-constable E 85 On this night about half-past nine o clock I heard cries of Murder and Police at 15 Hertford-street—the door was fastened and I got in at the parlour window and found the prisoner and the deceased—it was dark—he said My wife has cut my throat pointing to the prisoner—she said My husband has struck me three times and then he got a razor to cut my throat I wrenched it from his hand and drawed it across his throat —I took him to the hospital GEORGE WILBY police-constable E 77 I was with Golden—I got a light and saw Peter White and the prisoner in the room—he was standing up bleeding profusely from a wound in the throat—he said My wife has cut my throat —she said He has been beating me he took a razor to cut my throat I wrenched it from him and drawed it across his —I searched and found this knife produced on a shelf near where they stood—the blade was smeared with blood quite fresh—there were marks of blood on the shelf—I took the prisoner—I saw the body at the hospital it was that of the man I saw at Hertford-street Prisoner My husband must have put the knife there it was a razor the knife was clean I do not know in what way I done it Witness There is blood on the knife now—I found a razor at the farther corner of the room—there was no blood on it HENRY SEARLE GAYE I am house-surgeon at University Hospital On 5th June about half-past nine o clock the deceased was brought there in a state of extreme collapse bleeding from a gaping wound in the throat about two and a half inches long an inch deep and about half an inch wide—it was about two inches from the chin extending obliquely across the throat from the left side to the right—this knife is a likely instrument to have inflicted it—he lingered till 1st July and then died—the immediate cause of death was inflammation of the lungs—the wound in the throat would affect the lungs by the purulent matter from the wound—it is a peculiar kind of inflammation which is likely to follow injuries and surgical operations—it is accompanied by the formation of small abscesses on the lungs—it is the ordinary result of a wound Prisoner s Defence I have been severely ill-used every finger of my hand is bruised he committed a robbery at Brook-street Hanover-square and I saw him with forty guineas and there was another robbery I never told about he was always beating me he cohabited with Mrs Jones he accused me of a bad crime with a man named Cox he said I was going to tell about the murder of the police at Dublin he said he would accuse me of killing my husband in

t18491029-2009  2009 CHARLES BAINES feloniously killing and slaying Mary Ann Maine he was also charged on the Coroner s inquisition with the like offence MESSRS HUDDLESTON and COCKLE conducted the Prosecution ELIZA ANDREWS Jun I am eleven years old and live with my mother at 5 Hinton-street Bethnal-green I know the prisoner—he lived at our house with a woman that was called his wife—on Wednesday night 26th Sept I was called up-stairs a little after ten o clock—I saw Mrs Baines standing on the landing—the prisoner was in his room lying on the bed with his clothes on—Mrs Baines asked me to get her clothes I went in got them off a chair and took them to her—she said to the prisoner I will let you know when I put on my clothes and he got up and took away her clothes from her put them on the bed and lay on them he then got off the bed again came on the landing and kicked her twice—I saw him do it—she was at the top of the stairs—he kicked her in the stomach the first time—she staggered back and held by the bannisters—he had his boots on at the time they were bluchers—the second time he kicked her it was on the breast—she put her head down on the stairs and cried and he went and laid on the bed again—she had no clothes on—she was lying down when she received the second kick—she lay down when he first kicked her—she did not lie there a minute for I asked her if I should help her down and she came down with me into my mother s room the front room she walked down—she then sat on a chair and cried—she asked me to help her down on the floor I did and she laid on the floor in our room and groaned—my mother was out—I asked if I should fetch anybody and I fetched Mrs Marling the person next door and after Mrs Marling came in my mother came home—the prisoner was given into custody that same night—my mother called him down stairs she called him three times before he came—Mrs Baines had been packing up her things during the day she was going to move and my mother also—her crockery was packed up in a basket in her room I saw one piece lying on the floor Prisoner Q What did Mrs Baine call me when she got up what did she have in her hand A Nothing CATHERINE MARLING I am the wife of Thomas Marling of 4 Hinton street On Wednesday night 26th Sept I was sent for to the deceased s house—I went into Mrs Andrews room and saw the deceased there—she was in very great agony lying on the floor—I assisted her to Mrs Andrew s bed from which she was afterwards removed ELIZA ANDREWS I lived at 5 Hinton-street at the time in question—I came home on 26th about ten minutes to eleven o clock and found the deceased lying on my bed groaning dreadfully—I called the prisoner down stairs—after some time he came—he kissed his wife and said something to her in a low tone which I could not understand—he asked me if I could do anything for her and I think he asked her to go up-stairs—she said I can t —after that he said something to her and she called him a brute—I do not know that he made any answer to that but he went on and said she was not hurt she was only shamming that she did it to collect a mob—he said nothing about the injury nor did she in his presence—I went with her to the hospital DAVID DALE policeman K 425 About half-past twelve o clock on this night I was sent for and saw the deceased lying on the bed in Mrs Andrews s room—she appeared to be in a very dangerous state groaning and in great pain—Mrs Andrews sent up-stairs for the prisoner—he came down went up to the deceased kissed her and asked if he could assist her to the hospital—she said Oh you brute —he went and sat down again and said she was a bthing she was only shamming to colleet a mob about her—I did not bear anything said as to the cause of the injury—another constable took her in a cab to the hospital—I took the prisoner to the station—he said he had come home very tipsy that his wife said something to him which he did not like and a quarrel ensued and he kicked her CHARLES HARPER I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital On Thursday morning 27th Sept the deceased was brought there—I attended her until her death which was on the 28th thirteen hours after her admission—I examined her when she first came—I found no external marks of violence on the abdomen—she was very ill and suffering a great deal of pain in the abdomen—she seemed better until towards night when she got worse and gradually sank—I examined the body after death I found the membranes of the intestines as if inflammation had taken place in them—I should suppose it to have been of about two days standing—I also found slight disease of the lungs but I attached no importance to that as it respects the cause of death it was of very old standing—I found all the other organs of the body comparatively healthy at least there was nothing about them to account for death—I attribute the death to peritonitis or inflammation of the membrane covering the intestines—a kick with a boot would cause that—I should say the inflammation was of about two days standing at any rate very short I could not say the number of hours I should say between one and two days—I have heard the evidence—I should think an injury inflicted on the 26th might have caused what I saw on the 28th—it would depend very much on the condition of the deceased and the intensity of the inflammation—I should say she had been in a sickly state before COURT Q Could the inflammation you saw have existed if it was produced by a kick without there being some external mark A Certainly from the elasticity of the part CATHERINE MOODY I am the wife of John Moody a sailor—my daughter lived with the prisoner—she was the wife of Charles Mayne a ship scraper—her name was Mary Ann—I saw her dead body—it was the same person Prisoner s Defence written I returned from work between eight and nine o clock in liquor and found the deceased in bed I had been cohabiting with her for twelve months I went to her and said Well old girl how are you she said You b - - wh - - s son you shall not stop here get out of bed and she laid hold of a basin with the intention as I thought of throwing it at me I told her she had better be quiet I turned to go to bed when she struck me on the right ear and in the passion of the moment I kicked out at her not thinking she was within reach but unfortunately she was I beg

t18491217-210  210 WILLIAM HICKEY was indicted for feloniously killing and slaying William-M Carthy MICHAEL CLEARY On 6th June about five o clock in the evening I saw the prisoner and M Carthy fighting—Hickey had a knife in his hand—I attempted to separate them and saw McCarthy make a blow at Hickey—I interfered and got M Carthy away—he told me he was stabbed and put his band under his smock and showed me the blood Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q They were neither of them sober A I do not believe they were—I was not there at the commencement—Mrs Hickey was in the row near her husband—she was not fighting DANIEL HEALET I saw the prisoner and deceased close but I cannot say whether they struck each other—I saw Hickey draw a knife from his pocket and open it—he told M Carthy if he did not go away it would be the worse for him or something to that effect—he made over to M Carthy who struck him but whether Hickey returned the blow or not I cannot say—M Carthy ran up the lane and Hickey and the mob followed him Cross-examined Q Did you see any woman A Mrs Hickey was there—I do not know whether she had been insulted by M Carthy or how the row began WILLIAM PARKINSON I am sergeant-major in the East India Company s service The deceased was a recruit—I saw him at University Hospital several times—I saw him in July at the depot barracks CHARLES BLOXON I am a surgeon On 27th June I saw M Carthy and attended him until 12th Nov when be died—I examined his body death was caused by abscess of the left lung—the injury to the lung might have been caused by a wound with a knife—on 27th June there appeared to have been an injury over the left lung between the sixth and seventh ribs Cross-examined Q Did the knife penetrate the lung A I bad no means of ascertaining till after death and then the lung was entirely decomposed—the abscess might have begun to form about the beginning of July—I should say there was no abscess when he first came under my treatment because I tried him with the tests when he passed as a recruit on 27th June—I did not sound him—that would be the way to ascertain whether there was an abscess—I should put my ear to his back and strike his breast and if not satisfied I should use the stethoscope—I did not use any of those methods when I examined him about 2d July—I found a derangement of the lungs—an abscess is different from an ulcer abscesses frequently occur in the lungs without external injury—I have known an instance of abscess in the lungs from a wound with a sharp instrument—I cannot say that the wound reached the lungs—he was a strong healthy-looking man and I think full-blooded but he had lost a good deal of blood then—he was twenty-one or twenty-two years old COURT Q Was he put on duty before his death A No HENRY SEARLE GATE I am a surgeon of University College Hospital M Carthy was brought there on 6th June—I found a wound on his left side which appeared to have been made with a sharp-pointed instrument as a knife between the sixth and seventh rib—I probed it to the depth of an inch and a half but thought I might do mischief if I probed it further—it was in the region of the lung—he was under my care two or three weeks—he was in considerable danger the first ten days—there was inflammation of the lung and membrane also—the injury would be very likely to occasion an abscess—I should say there was no other cause for it—he was a strong healthy man EBENEZER IRONMONGER policeman On 6th June I went into the charge-room at the police-station and saw M Carthy sitting on a chair—I saw a stab in his left side—I took him outside to see if he could identify the man who did it—he pointed to a man who I apprehended and was obliged to let go again—I took the deceased to the hospital—when I took the prisoner I told him M Carthy was dead—he said he wished he had given himself tip when he had done it—he was very much distressed and could scarcely stand MR BLOXON re-examined I cannot say in what state the roan was when he left University Hospital—when I received him he was in a very debilitated state from loss of blood—he rallied after being under treatment-the first symptoms of the abscess on the lungs was shivering and general fever that came on on 2d July—I saw nothing that could have brought that on but the wound—the original wound had healed when he came in and he said he felt all right but weak—it was on 6th Aug that the wound re-opened and discharged an immense quantity of blood—that would be the effect of the abscess—pus always finds its way externally and would take the weakest point—I have no reason to think that the abscess was forming before the wound was inflicted I should say not from the appearance of the man—an abscess would not form immediately from a wound it is the result of inflammation it would take time—I do not think any inflammation existed when he arrived at the depot—I dare say the loss of blood had kept it down—I do not think he was discharged from the hospital too soon—I think he was in a convalescent state when he came—he was put into the hospital of the depot immediately—I took him under my charge on 27th July—that was the first time I saw him MR GAYE re-examined I saw him when he was brought in on 6th June—he left on the 22nd he was then convalescent and in a fit state to be discharged had he not been going to another hospital—I can imagine no other cause of the abscess but the wound—he had severe inflammation immediately after his admission and by very severe means that was overcome—he was left in a state of great debility and at the time of his dismissal there might have been chronic inflammation of the lung which probably gave rise to the abscess GUILTY Aged 28 — Transported for Seven Years

took place—there were several persons drinking there the deceased was one—the younger prisoner was trying to set one of the witnesses and a person they called Fabie fighting and white so doing Mrs Prestage came in to ask her husband to come to his tea and she told young Boxall he ought to be ashamed of himself as they had all been drinking together—he said she ought to hold her tongue—she said she would not and he then said You b—y cow I will make you —the deceased got up and told him not to call her that again—he said I tell you what Ben I am not afraid of you old cock and never was and he then ran at deceased and knocked him down with his head at the bottom of the deceased s stomach—Mrs Prestage said You coward to do that and he struck her and as the deceased got up he said You coward to hit a woman in the way she is she was in the family way —he then turned round and ran at deceased again in the same way caught hold of his leg threw him again and they both went down together—his head was then at the bottom part of the deceased s stomach—they fell in that way—he pushed his body right into him like—the father then interfered he had taken no part in it up to the time the deceased received the injury that was afterwards discovered—he came in and sat down just as they had the few words—when they were both down the second time the father struck the deceased with his fists somewhere in his head—the deceased was holding the son down and the father struck him and tried to get him away—one of the witnesses struck him and got him up—the father then caught hold of the leg of a table and in pulling it off it struck the deceased s wife and he said Here Stephe take this and kill the b—r Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q The elder prisoner only struck deceased once A Three times altogether—he did not strike him at all till the deceased had been knocked down the second time—he then struck him about the head not in the belly Jury Q Was the elder prisoner present at the commencement of the quarrel A Yes THOMAS HOWELL I am a dresser at St Thomas s Hospital—I saw the deceased after he was brought there—the symptoms he had when he came in were those of very great prostration and severe pain in the abdomen and inability to pass the urine though he had great desire at the time—he came in on 22nd at noon and died on 25th at half-past five o clock—I assisted in making a post-mortem examination and found a rupture of the bladder with peritonritis and inflammation arising from extravasation of the urine—those appearances were sufficient in my judgment to account for his death—it was such an injury as would he caused by a blow or the falling of a heavy weight on that part—in other respects he appeared to be perfectly healthy—I found no other bruises or anything to account for death—the rupture of the bladder PAUL SULLIVAN I am a labourer at Millpond-road Bermondsey I was at this public-house in the tap-room and saw the deceased Prestage and his wife there—Prestage was drinking with some other men—young Boxall stood against the fire-place and he run in at Prestage with his head at the bottom of his stomach—I do not know where the father then was I had not seen him—Prestage was thrown on the ground by the effect of the blow—he got up and the younger prisoner ran at him a second time—I saw the father afterwards but did not see him come in—he had the leg of a table in his hand—the deceased was thrown down again when young Boxall ran at him a second time—I did not see the elder prisoner do anything with the table leg—I did not see what became of it—I did not see who helped the son up—I did not take much notice of them—I thought it would only have been a bit of a scratch—I did not think anything would have come of it or I should have taken more notice JAMES CARROLL I was at the public-house when the row took place between Boxall and Prestage—I saw the younger prisoner run at Prestage—the elder prisoner was then in the room sitting close to the fire alongside of me—Prestage and the other prisoner had been sitting near the window—when he ran at Prestage I did not see or hear the elder prisoner do anything COURT Q Who helped the younger prisoner up A I did not see anybody do so—I did not see anything in the elder prisoner s hand—I did not see him take any part in it or say anything to his son—I saw what was going on—there was much hallooing and there were seven or eight people in the room—I did not see him with the leg of a table in his hand PETER WOOLDRIDGE I was at the public-house when the deceased was hurt by the younger prisoner—when they were down the second time I saw the father break off the leg of a table—he was going to give it to his son and said Here Steve kill the b—r and I ran to him and got it away and then they both attacked me and I received an injury in my ribs—after the policeman took the younger prisoner out and I took the deceased home he said he felt as if something had stabbed him in his inside and all his inside seemed lying up in his chest—I afterwards went into a public-house where the elder prisoner was—he had a mat over his shoulders—he dropped it and attacked me—I afterwards went into a public-house where they both were and they both attacked me and tried to make me fight—when the elder prisoner gave his son the leg of the table I wrenched it out of his hand—I saw him pull his son up but I did not see him strike the deceased—when we were round at Mr Short s the younger prisoner came in and said I have put one b—r to bed and I will put the other one and he looked round saw me and ran at me—the elder prisoner was there also and he pulled off his jacket to fight me—that was after the deceased was taken home Cross-examined Q Did you see the deceased knocked down the first time A Yes I do not believe the elder prisoner was there then I did not see him—I am certain I saw him picking up his son from the deceased after he was knocked down the second time—he was standing at the right side of the fire-place—there was a good deal of light—the room is all windows—I should say there were from eight to ten people there—the elder prisoner was about three or four feet from the deceased when he was knocked down the second time—I first saw him interfere to pick up his son when the deceased had been knocked down the second time MARY ANN PRESTAGE I saw the elder prisoner go and break the leg off the table he said to his son Kill the b—with this settle him Steve —I saw him strike my husband once or twice before that—that was before he was knocked down the second time—between the two times he was prevented using the leg by somebody taking it out of his hand—he then went and pulled off his son—I saw the younger prisoner push his head into my husband s stomach as hard as he could—he said Get up you b— have you had enough and with that he pushed his head so and he said I think you have killed me I have got my death blow —he was assisted up by two young men Cross-examined Q Where was the elder prisoner when your husband was first knocked down A Close behind his son—he went to assist his son up and struck my husband—he assisted his son up twice and struck my husband between the first and second attack—he struck him about the head and face—I am sure he had struck him before he was assisted up the second time—my husband was being raised from the ground at the time—he did not strike him before he went to assist his son up—it was while he was assisting him up that he struck my husband—that was between the first and second times—I did not see the elder prisoner do anything to my husband before the younger prisoner ran at him a second time—I was knocked down myself by the younger prisoner after he struck my husband the first time—I saw the elder prisoner in the room then—I think he must have seen me struck COURT to JOHN HOLLANDS Q How long was it between the first and second attacks by the younger prisoner—not three minutes—immediately after

between 9 and 10 o clock the prisoner was present—when I went into the room she was in a very bad state not fit to say much—she spoke to me before she died and the prisoner heard what she said—all she

down to the door of the prisoner s room and he closed it just as I got there—I heard the little boy cry out Oh father you have killed my mother she is dead —I unlatched the door as fast as I could and the prisoner had not returned from the door then after shutting it—he was in the act of taking his wife up by the hair he swung her round and knocked one cane bottomed chair down and the next to it as well the baby s chair and he threw her into a corner of the room on a little bed on the floor and said Go to bed to your child you b—r —the baby was sitting on the foot of the bed screaming ready to go into fits—I said to the prisoner Don t ill use that poor afflicted creature don t ill use her —directly he returned from the bed I retired from the room and stood outside for I dare say ten minutes and heard his wife talking to him but being up in a corner I could not distinctly hear what it was but he was accusing her of spending some money and the little boy said Father mother has not spent the money she gave it to me to fetch something in —he told his father that she had given him 1s to buy a pair of shoes which were in the drawer and tried to smoothes his father from going at her again—he said two or three times over Don t father don t father my mother is dead —after I left the room the deceased called out a time or two on which the prisoner said he would give her something presently for hallooing—I went away after that and saw so more till the Monday—she was then upright in bed in a sitting posture she was such a size that she could not lie down—her eyes and face were in a dreadful state and very much discoloured every part of her was swelled just ready to burst—she could just see out of the corner of one eye—she spoke to me when I went to the bedside and asked me how my daughter was who had been very ill I told her she was a great deal better and with difficulty she said she was very glad—that was all that passed and I went out of the room immediately—she could scarcely speak Cross-examined Q Had you seen her on the Saturday A Yes a great many times she then appeared better than she had for a length of time—she had not been drinking when I saw her at 20 minutes past 8—she did not fall down stairs in our house a day or two before—I never heard of it—I did not see the prisoner on the Saturday till just as the public houses closed—he did not appear to me to be drunk—I do not think he was much the worse for liquor when this occurred—I had not been in his company but he walked up and down the street just before as comfortable as possible—I do not think he was any the worse for liquor—I do not know what he had had—he only passed me at the front door at 12 o clock to go to the public house—it was closed and he came home—I may have said I thought he was half tipsy but he was not tipsy MR HUDDLESTON Q Had you seen him walk A Yes from our house down to the Pitt s Head and back again as straight as a man could walk and if he had been tipsy he could not have done that and I do not consider that he was tipsy FRANCIS MEAD I am the prisoner s son and am just eleven years old I was present when my mother died about 11 o clock on Monday night—on the Saturday night before that my mother and I took tea together my father was at home lying down on the boards asleep—my mother had not been well—after tea I and my little sister went out—we came back between 7 and 8 o clock—I then went out again and came back about half past 10 o clock—my mother was then lying down on the boards by the side of my father with the baby—she was not asleep but the baby was going off to sleep—about half or three quarters of an hour after that my father and mother had some words about some money that my father bad given to my mother and he suspected her of spending some of the money—he hit my mother in the face with his fist and knocked her down—he then kicked her twice here on the hip while she was lying on the boards—as he did that he said something in his own language Irish—I did not understand what it was—I cannot remember whether my mother said anything to him—Mrs Gray did not come into the room at all all she did was just to open the door and put her head in and as soon as she had done that she went out again—I cannot remember what my father was doing to my mother at the time Mrs Gray came—there was a bed in the room—my mother was not near it she was up against the door—she was on the bed afterwards because my father put her on it by the two arms—he did not drag her there be lifted her up off the ground by her arms—I was very much frightened when I saw this going on—one of the chairs was knocked over but only one—I cannot say whether that was done at the time my father had got my mother by the arms—my mother was not able to walk after that only by holding by something—she was able to walk before he struck and kicked her—my father afterwards went and fetched a medical man—my father had his boots on when he kicked my mother—he has a lame foot with a laced clump boot on it—it was with that foot that be kicked my mother—it had the dump on it Cross-examined Q Had your mother been out on that Saturday A She went out to bring home my father—he spoke to her about spending money in drink—that is what the quarrel was about—I am sure he lifted her by the arms when he put her on the bed—the little baby was crying in my arms she was not on the bed she cried from the commencement of the quarrel to almost the latter end DUCKWORTH JOHN NELSON I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons practising at St John s Wood I knew the deceased for some time—I was called on Sunday morning 29th May between 10 and 11 o clock and found her sitting up in bed breathing with great difficulty—her eyes were bandaged—I observed bruises about her arms and considerable distention from the escape of air underneath the skin indicating that the lungs had been wounded—the tenth and eleventh ribs on the left side were fractured—she was perfectly sensible—her husband was in the room and while he was there she said that she met with an accident by falling down stairs over a pail or a bucket—I saw her again on the Monday morning between 6 and 6 o clock—the prisoner was present and I asked him to retire and then had a conversation with her it appeared to me that she was conscious of the dangerous state in which she was—I do not know whether she expected immediate death but her condition was manifestly dangerous and I think she was impressed with that condition COURT Q Did you communicate to her that she might expect almost immediately to die A No she did not say anything to me expressive of an expectation of immediately dying—my opinion was that her lifew as in danger and I thought she must have perceived that her disease was dan- gerous from my calling twice in one day and the house surgeon once making three visits in a day The Court considered that there was not sufficient proof of the deceased being in immediate apprehension of death to make what she stated in the prisoner s absence inadmissible in evidence MR HUDDLBSTON Q Did you make a post-mortem examination A I did on the Thursday morning by order of the Coroner—I found a small clot of blood between the scalp and the skull about the size of a shilling—on removing the skull I found no remarkable indication of disease—I found the tenth and eleventh ribs on the left side broken—the inflammation which resulted from the fractured ribs was the cause of her death—I have heard the evidence and believe that the kicks I have heard described would be sufficient to account for the injuries I found on the ribs Cross-examined Q If the kick had been sufficiently strong and violent it would have caused it but a fall down stairs would have caused a fracture A Certainly—the ribs being fractured the edge of the bone presented a very acute point and penetrated through the pleura into the lungs I believe that her death resulted from inflammation of the pleura—I had been treating her before for disease of the lungs she had bronchitis and also a disease called emphysema in which the lungs present the character of large vescicles resulting from dilated or ruptured air cells probably both MR HUDDLESTON Q You say the ribs perforated the lungs A Yes that was the effect of the fracture which might have been produced by the kicks described—I believe that the inflammation which followed from the puncture of the pleura by the broken ribs was the cause of death—the dilation of the lungs was in a very different part—there were no morbid indications in the lungs at that part which would in my judgment be the cause of death but she had had that disease for some years and it might eventually have caused her death if this had not taken place GEORGE EDMUND SMALE I am a surgeon I assisted in the post-mortem examination of the deceased—in my judgment the broken ribs were the cause of death—the ribs might have been broken by the kicks which I have heard described—the injuries were quite recent Cross-examined Q The broken ribs might have been produced by a fall down stairs A Yes the prisoner fetched me—I had been attending the deceased before and had frequently seen her at the Dispensary and prescribed for her MARY WYNNE I am a widow and live at Victoria-terrace Portland-road On Sunday 29th May I went to see the deceased—the prisoner was sitting by the side of the bed and I asked him how it happened—he said it was from the effects of drink that she called upon him on the Saturday and he asked her to have something to drink that he was in company with some other persons and she would not have it and he came home and laid down to sleep and when he got up he found her lying before the fire and she was so afraid of him that she ran down stairs and broke her ribs—I stopped with her till 10 minutes past 11 o clock by the clock in the house—about 6 o clock she requested to see a clergyman and the prisoner said If you have anything to say say it before Mrs Wynne —she called him to her bedside and said Francis I am worse —he held his head over and I beard her say something I could not hear what but he said If you have got anything to say here is Mrs Wynne your old acquaintance speak out —she said What do you want me to say in a very short tone—she then said I forgive you and the Lord forgive you take care of my children and do not beat Frankey EMMA RICHARDSON examined by MR M PRENDE ROAST I live in the same house On the Sunday after this took place the little boy came to me with a message that his mother wanted to see me and I went down and saw her she was in bed—the prisoner was not present—the deceased was in great agony and told me that she was going to die—when I went into her room site was in a kneeling position in the bed and I scarcely knew her—she said Mrs Richardson I am dying come to me and I will tell you —I said Good God Mrs Mead what has happened —she said We went out yesterday you know we were teetotallers but we took a drop to drink and glory be to God some one over-persuaded me and I took half a glass of gin and the share of a pot of beer —she was in great agony and I got some vinegar to put to her head—I asked her how her ribs were broken and she said that Doctor Nelson had been to see her and that she had had a fall down stairs and broke her ribs—I went to the Dispensary and the doctor came back with me MR HUDDLESTON Q Was the prisoner in the room at the time A No this is my deposition looking at it —it was read over to me before I signed it—the prisoner was in the room when the deceased told Dr Nelson but not when she told me first and when Dr Nelson came into the room he asked her how it was and she said she had had a fall—me and my sister were there and assisted the doctors in stripping her COURT Q She appeared to you to be in immediate apprehension of dying A Yes she told me she was dying directly I entered the room COURT to MR NELSON Q What did she say to you on the Sunday A There were two statements made—she at one time stated in the prisoner s presence that she met with an accident by falling down stairs and I took a subsequent opportunity of asking her in the prisoner s absence and she said the same thing—the last statement was made on Monday in the prisoner s absence but both times she said the same thing GUILTY Aged 42 —

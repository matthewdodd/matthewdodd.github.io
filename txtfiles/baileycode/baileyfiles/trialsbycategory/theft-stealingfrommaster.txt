we are coach-makers The prisoner Green had been in our employ four or five years as foreman of the sawyers - Hewett had worked for us while Green was in our employ but I do not know where he lived Green had access to our planks continually - I saw some of them at Long-acre after they had been at Bow-street and knew them to be ours Green had no power to dispose of them in any way Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Had you any mark upon them A Yes they had been cut from one tree Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q Had Green authority to buy any wood for you A A small quantity for our joiners but not for our coach-makers - he has looked at wood which he did not purchase he could have told some other person of this wood who might have gone and bought it The marks on those planks correspond exactly with the marks on those left behind he never sold any wood for us Green was only a sawyer he did not look out wood for us JOSEPH NEALE I have been in the employ of Messrs Houlditch for two or three years as a labourer for a day or two in a week Green was employed there but I never saw Hewett there On Saturday the 25th of March Green gave me twenty mahogany boards and an elm board upon a truck to take to Mr Hewett No 5 Duck-lane Berwick-street Soho I took them and gave them to a man of the name of Davy I went back again with the truck to Carburton-street and got twenty more mahogany boards and another elm board which were loaded by me and some boys Green and I took them to the same place by Green s direction I saw Mr Davy again and when I was unloading them I saw Mr Hewett in the loft when I had unloaded the truck Davy asked me if there was any thing to pay I said Mr Green told me Mr Hewett was to pay me he asked me what - I said 5 s which he paid me Mr Hewett did not speak to me at all but I am sure of his person Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Were you then in the employ of Messrs Houlditch A No I did not know but that Messrs Houlditch had employed Mr Green to sell these boards - that I swear Mr Houlditch never sent me with any boards to sell Green told me that Mr Hewett was to pay me for my trouble I did not ask what he was to pay me I have been employed by Green and always left it to him I took them in Mr Houlditch s truck - the distance might be half a mile I was nearly six hours about it and I earned the money I asked if a crown was too much and he said No he went and got it None of the boys are here who helped to load I did not know the prosecutors premises very well I did not give Mr Houlditch any notice of this I went according to Green s direction I was taken to the watch-house on Monday week - I never suspected there was any thing wrong I was accused before the Magistrates and then made the charge against Green Avis took me I asked what he took me for he said concerning Green robbing Messrs Houlditch I did not say at the public-house that I did not know Green at all to my knowledge but I will not swear whether I did or not I heard an officer tell the Magistrate on Tuesday that I had said I did not know Green - I said I had not said so to my recollection I was a little in liquor but not tipsy I was sworn before the Magistrate as to where I took the boards I did not accuse Green to get off myself Re-examined Q Whether a crown was too little or too much is that what you received A Yes I received two half-crowns I lodge in Carburton-street and come at a short notice to assist at Messrs Houlditchs I was taken at the Nelson public-house in Charles-street the officers told me they had been looking after me about the robbery which Green had been taken up for at Messrs Houlditch and I had taken the boards down - I said I had I was taken about half-past eleven o clock at night I was a little in liquor but not drunk GEORGE DAVY I was working at Mr Hewett s in March last I was employed there by a man of the name of Howe a coach-maker I was there when Neale came with a truck Mr Hewett was then in the loft I took twenty boards from Neale the first time and put them into the loft by Hewett s direction Neale came back again with twenty more Hewett told me he expected some pannel boards to come and wished me to assist the man in bringing them into the loft - I heard no question asked who brought them and did not see a name on the truck I paid Neale two half-crown pieces which I got from Hewett he said it was too much but he sent down the money I did not hear where he came from or any thing about him Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q Was your master there Mr Howe A Yes it was about three or four o clock - Howe was in the loft when the last pannels came and he had been there before but was not there when the first pannels came The loft is Hewett s but my master was working in it there was no other person at work there The boards were large - any person could see them in the street MR ADOLPHUS Q Mr Howe and Mr Hewett were both then in the loft A Yes my master had leave to work there I believe the stores there were Hewett s property there is no conveying such things privately by day-light it is not usual for trucks to stand in the night delivering such things I should be afraid the watchman would take me into custody GEORGE AVIS I am a police officer In consequence of some information I executed a search warrant on the premises of Hewett in Duck-lane on the 28th of March about five o clock in the afternoon - I found forty mahogany and two elm boards there were no other articles there - I saw Davy there I asked questions of him but did not take him into custody Green was taken the same night - I saw him next day I took Neale myself at a public-house at the corner of Carburton-street about twenty minutes before twelve o clock Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Was there a brother officer with you A No I took him to the office myself I told him I wanted to ask him no question but that I took him for taking the boards down I did not mention Green s name to him Duke who was with me was not bound over I did not hear Duke say that Neale had denied knowing Green Neale had been drinking a little but he could understand very well Cross-examined by MR BRODERICK Q You searched Mr Hewett s premises A Yes I had some conversation with Davy Hewett came and surrendered himself to me the same evening he said he bought these boards of Green and thought it was all right he gave 6 1/2 d per foot for them he had paid 3 l on account and came voluntarily to answer any questions that might he put to him this was before Green was taken - I did not hear him say he had been a fellow workman with Green RICHARD BROWN I am servant to Mr Jas Holditch I went to see Green taken in custody by Johnson one of the Bow-street officers - I believe he was not told what he was taken for I had I some conversation with him before he was taken at the corner of Long-acre and St Martin s-lane - I met him there promiscuously I went up to him and asked if his name was Green and if he had heard of what had occurred - he then stated that he had robbed his master he was very sorry for it and that others were implicated in it - he said there was a man of the name of Wright in Carburton-street who had been concerned in it as well as himself and he had sold the property for 20 l and had given Wright or was to give him 10 l to keep the secret instead of which he had heard he had informed his master of what had occurred and he intended to be a hundred or a hundred and fifty miles from the spot by that time to-morrow - this was about nine o clock in the evening and he was in custody in about three quarters of an hour - I went and told Mr James Holditch of it immediately I went to the officer and then went with him to take him Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Are you still in Mr Holditch s employ A Yes - I know Green only by sight he told me all this of his own accord - he was tipsy - we were not intimate A man named Wright was produced next day but he was let go Green was taken in a public-house near his own residence - I have been in Mr Holditch s employ about three months GEORGE WRIGHT I am a wheeler in the employ of Messrs Holditch s and have the care of their premises in Carburton-street - I saw part of this property removed by Neale between two and four o clock I did not see Green at that time there was no engagement that he was to give me any money or any thing of that kind - I did not give any information to Mr Holditch - Green had access to all the boards on the premises and I considered Neale as a porter he had been at work there at different times I had seen Green that day before he was in custody but had no conversation with him SAMUEL CHOICE I am in the employ of Messrs Holditch as a coach-maker I know Green and Hewett - I have seen Hewett twice I am certain and I think three times at their premises - I never saw him come up into the loft with Green till the last time about six weeks ago SAMUEL SANDERS I am a Bow-street officer I took Green into custody at the Cart and Horses public-house Little St Martin s-lane soon after nine o clock he was rather in liquor and asleep - he was not sensible till I shook him up I told him what I took him for when we got to Bow-street he said he had nothing to say - I saw Neale by his side in the public-house - I asked him he if knew Neale and he said No and Neale denied knowing him at the door of the public-house I did not know then that Neale was wanted and I let him go I searched Hewett and found on him a book and a rule which belong to Neale RICHARD GREEN S Defence I deny saying that I did not know Neale HEWETT S Defence I purchased these boards of Green as I would of any other person he had introduced me on a former occasion to some person over the water - I agreed to give 6 1/2 d per foot for them I had a regular bill of parcels with them - I gave Green a written note to deliver them on the premises and told him to send them there in consequence of my being moving about that time They were sent in and 5 s was asked for the cartage which I did not consider an over-charge - it could not be supposed that I should buy them if I had known they were not properly come by having my character and family at stake - I had rather a large stock in hand considering the state in which it was not being dry - very ill sawed and shaken - I considered it a fair price it cannot be supposed that with all the yards in the metropolis open to me I should be guilty of doing a mean action JOHN NOURSE I am foreman to Messrs Houlditchs I missed a number of boards from Carburton-street on the 28th of March I could not tell how many - I found them in Duck-lane in a loft which Hewett admitted to be his I had seen the boards at Christmas stock-taking to the best of my knowledge I asked Green on Monday morning where these boards were taken to and he said to Long-acre I applied at Bow-street to get a search-warrant and found them Hewett said he had bought them JURY Q What are you in the service of Messrs Holditch A I am foreman we should be glad to buy the boards at 8 d a-foot but they cost us 8 1/2 d or 6 d which was the market price then I am not aware of any place where we could have bought them at 5 1/2 d Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Have you been on good terms with Hewett A I have not animosity and have had no quarrel with him Witnesses for the Defence WILLIAM HENRY VERNON I am a coach-maker in the New road I have known Hewett fifteen years - he has been a very good character and a very honest man I have seen the boards outside - they are worth about 6 1/2 d or 7 d a foot I have had them offered to me for that within this two months - I consider 6 1/2 d a fair price for them I have known Hewett by his dealing with me the boards would be worth more than that if they were not shaken - the longer a board has been in seasoning the more valuable it is JAMES WATSON I am a coach-maker residing at No 15 Long-acre I have looked at these boards - I should think 6 d a-foot quite enough for them I have known Hewett twenty-five or twenty-six years - I have had no dealings with him but have always heard him spoken well of Mr ADOLPHUS Q Do you mean to say that shaken as these boards are 6 d would be too much for them A I have bought some much better than they are this morning at 7 d JOHN AXTEL I am a coach-maker and live in Upper North-place Gray s Inn-lane - I have lived there thirty-five years I have known Hewett since 1821 he was always an honest upright character and the most industrious man in the trade - the value of these boards is about 6 d I would not give 6 d for them these boards are shaken but if they were sound I would not give 6 d for them Three witnesses gave Green a good character GREEN -

he was my foreman I had formerly a man in my service named Haskins - he has left me about two years and a half and set up in business as a slater in a small street leading from Vauxhall-road - I have had no dealings with him - I know Philip Branton by sight that is all On the 20th of April a barge of slates called duchesses arrived at my wharf - they were mine - I told the prisoner to send two loads of them to the Penitentiary but had not directed him to dispose of any others to any person and certainly not to Haskins Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q Did you allow the prisoner to sell any slates for you A At one time I allowed him to sell a sort called waste but no others there was a pass-book kept in which he furnished me with an account of what he sold he always had a desire to sell slates but I forbid him he had paid me money for some which he had sold perhaps two days before he was taken there never was a meeting for the purpose of settling this business and there was never a balance of 30 l due to me from him - I have an entry in my book on the 23d of June when he paid me some money He lived in a house of mine on the wharf - I lived at a distance if a person came to give orders they made inquiries of him he generally settled with me on a Saturday evening for the slates he sold - there were some deficiencies but I did not think it worth while to discharge him for them being an old servant MR ADOLPHUS Q Had he at any time after no authority from you to sell valuable slates by the cart load A No never - there is no entry of a cart load of slates sold by him in his book - there is no entry of two cart loads sold to Haskins I did not find it out till July - this little book is the prisoner s wife s writing -

he said I should meet Mr Haskins there and that the slates were for him I met him and he told me to put the slates down by the side of Mr Westmacott s wall near the iron foundry I took them at two separate times in Mr Struthers cart Haskins gave me 5 s a load for taking them - I do not generally receive so much I never gave my master information about it till I had been examined I had told the prisoner I thought matters were not going on right and it would be found out he said it will make no odds to you Cross-examined Q Had you not been in custody some days before you said any thing about it to your master A Yes I was in custody for the slates taken in April JAMES BRADLEY I am a slater in the employ of Mr Struthers I saw these Duchess slates in the wharf but did not see them come I saw two loads taken by Webb past the Penitentiary -

he said he could burn them - we both tore off some covers and put the leaves into a bag this was about half-past two o clock - some of the books were whole except the covers and some torn apart - I took them to Parker s and asked if he would buy some waste paper -

t18260216-197  558 WILLIAM BAYLIS and ALBION LODGE were indicted for stealing on the 15th of February 200lbs weight of grease value 30s the goods of Thomas Knowles their master THOMAS KNOWLES I am a tallow-chandler and live in Orange-street Red Lion-square I have a warehouse adjoining my house and a passage through to Kingsgate-street - I have a melting-place in Liquorpond-street - the prisoners have been some years in my service they are melters and we are obliged to do that early in the morning - in the other parts of the day they had little to do and when they went to my customers with the horse and cart they used to have my money to make purchases of grease from any person they might meet with and on their return I paid them the market price for it which was 18s per cwt I received it in Kingsgate-street they brought some on Wednesday the 15th of February in a cask with 3qrs 5lbs wrote on it in chalk I weighed it and it weighed 3qrs 5lbs I paid them 2l 15s for it and said What are you going to do next they said they had to go for some more to Clerkenwell I filled up that tub in Kingsgate-street and made it up to 5cwt 18lbs - it was then put into the cart by the prisoners myself and other servants to go to my melting house in Liquorpond-street George Restall my other servant and the prisoners went with it I had seen a quantity in the warehouse in Liquorpond-street that morning in the pan- there was 2cwt 2lbs - the 5cwt 18lbs was to be added to it and the weight of the cask deducted from it Restall afterwards made some communication to me I went with two men to Liquorpond-street and weighed the fat very exactly - I found a deficiency of 2cwt and 1qr nearly I did not see the prisoner again that day though they said they should return with some more from Clerkenwell they returned about noon the next day and brought the same tub which they had taken which then contained 4cwt 1qr and 16lbs of fat I weighed it and said You know I have been very uneasy and uncomfortable about the losses I have had - what did you do with that tub of fat you took last night they said they had emptied it into the melting pan which would have taken about twenty minutes I told them I certainly must find out what they had done with the fat that was in the tub they said they could bring people to prove where they had got the fat they had brought that morning and Lodge said No one saw it taken away I said they had They then clenched their fists at the boy and went away swearing I gave information at the office and they were taken in about six hours I have never received any clue to know where they bought it - the value of the 2cwt of greese would be 36s they get a profit by buying this grease and selling it to me Lodge has been with me nearly five years and Baylis three or four Cross-examined by Mr BRODRICK Q Do you collect your grease from different people A Yes the last time I weighed the grease in Liquorpond-street on the 16th it weighed 4cwt 1qr I had been there on the morning of the 15th and there was some grease in the pan which I did not weigh - Reed the officer saw it weighed on the 16th Restall and Freshingfield are employed in Liquorpond-street when Restall is not there Freshingfield locks the place and brings me the key COURT Q What were they to do with the cask A They were to empty it clean out and then weight it in the presence of George Restall they were then to take it away empty and get some more fat in it if any part of it had been taken away I might have bought it again - it would have undergone no change whatever I saw the grease on the 15th it appeared to me to be 2cwt and upwards GEORGE RESTALL I am servant to Thomas Knowles I have been so for three or four years I was at his shop in Orange-street when the prisoners brought the grease on the 15th - it was taken out of the scale and filled up with the stuff on the board to 5cwt 18lbs - it was then put into the cart and I drove it to Liquorpond-street - the two prisoners walked I had seen 2cwt 2lbs put into the pan the day before which came from Mr Bullock s and on the morning of the 15th it appeared to be the same quantity when I got to the warehouse I turned the cart round and they got the cask by the side of the copper and Baylis got the fork to empty it I took hold of the fork and Lodge gave me half a crown to go and get a feed of corn I went and was gone about five minutes or not quite so much I had not to go one hundred yards - on my return I saw the cask in the cart upon its beam ends I went into the melting-house and locked into the copper and thought all was not right - I said nothing to the prisoners they went into the street where Albion said to Baylis We may as well have something to eat Baylis said I was to have gone home to dinner - my wife has got a meat pudding but she must not mind its being cold they then went up the steps of a public-house - I locked up the doors - they said to me Come in I said I did not want any thing to drink but I went into the house and spoke to my father - they offered me some beer but I would not have it I was in the house about eight minutes and then came out I left them going along the passage I went home to master and told him what I had seen - he came to the warehouse and weighed the fat and took the weights - there was 4cwt 26lb in the pan which was less by 217lbs than I expected I had kept the keys from the time I locked the door till my master got there Cross-examined Q Did you weigh the grease on the 14th A Yes and gave my master the account of it Mr Bullock was there when it was weighed Freshingfield went to the warehouse as well as myself I did not weigh the grease on the 15th The pan is a large surface and it would be difficult without trying to know what quantity was in it The stuff put in on the 14th was kitchen stuff - about the same sort as that put in on the 15th- I did not look into the cask when the prisoners were gone into the public house - it laid on its side in the cart with its mouth towards the tail COURT Q You say you weighed it on the 14th A Yes and I saw it on the 15th - if there had been 2 cwt gone I should have missed it I looked into the pan and>it appeared all right after I left the melting house I gave the keys to my master REDIT FRESHINGFIELD I am servant to the prosecutor I was present when the prisoner brought this cask to be weighed in Kingsgate-street I saw it loaded and was in the shop when Restall came and gave information - we all three went and weighed the grease in the melting-pan - there was 2cwt short of what there should have been there was only 4cwt 26lbs I had been there on the night of the 14th when it was weighed - and we put upwards of 2cwt into the pan and 4cwt and upwards was sent on the morning of the 15th I saw the quantity on the morning of the 15th before the cask was sent from the house WILLIAM BAYLIS Defence There was an opportunity for Restall to look into the cart and it was his own offer to go and fetch the corn - he went and got some cat s-meat a great part of the grease was emptied before he went away - when he returned he said nothing to us - we went and had some refreshment - he went home to his master s as I suppose after he had been with his father GEORGE RESTALL They asked me to get some dog s-meat - and I said I might as well get some for the cat I was not absent more than five minutes - I went for the meat while they were measuring the corn JURY Q Was there a tail-board to the cart A Yes it was as high as the sides -

he did not know I was going to search his father s house Cross-examined Q Which is the key that opened the box A One key opened all the boxes - I cannot say which I found three of the keys in the prisoner s cupboard at his master s house - I do not conceive them to be common keys MR DAVIDSON The goods produced are such as I have in my possession I never sold the prisoner or his father any thing of the sort - his father sells wood about the street - these were my property but may have been sold GUILTY Aged 22 Transported for Fourteen Years

he was alone and went up Great Bush-lane the prisoner Michael then passed me and wished me good morning and he joined Theophilus in Chequer-yard I saw them go into Kennet s on Dowgate-hill both together - Michael assisted in taking the basket off Theophilus shoulder I saw Kennet at the door taking it in I informed Mr Hillman as soon as I could see him Michael was at Mr Hillman s when I went there and at first denied assisting him down with the basket till I recalled it to his mind Q What did he say A He asked if I wanted to implicate him I said no further than that he assisted in taking the bottles off the man s shoulder which he admitted he said he did not rightly know the man but thought he should if he saw him I went to Kennet s with Mr Hillman - he was not at home I found him at Tower-hill when I went to his house a second time I saw several baskets he hesitated about the matter the basket was never produced in my presence I took Michael into custody the same day Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q What basket Theophilus had you cannot tell A It was a prickle - there are a great many in London I did not see Michael near him till he got into Chequer-yard which is about one hundred and fifty yards from Mr Hillman s I knew Michael before - he knew me to be a street-keeper it took him a minute or two to get to the place after he passed me - I was about five yards off when he helped the basket down - I do not know whether he saw me I did not hide myself it was about a quarter-past eight o clock and daylight Mr Hillman spoke to him first and then sent for me and asked me about it - I asked if he did not assist a man to take a basket of bottles off his shoulder at Mr Kennet s - he rather equivocated at first and neither said Yes nor No but What do you wish to implicate me in it he said he certainly did assist in taking it off but at first said he might assist for what he knew but he denied it at first Kennet is a wine-cooper and bottle-dealer The prisoners both know me perfectly well Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Were you on duty A Yes - I go on duty at half-past six o clock in the winter I do not think Theophilus saw me I did not stop them but went to Mr Hillman s MR JAMES PENNY HILLMAN My warehouse is in Old Swan-lane in the City On the 12th of February the prisoner Michael was in my employ - Theophilus is his cousin I have heard Michael call him cousin - they haveboth worked together in my warehouse Theophilus sailed one voyage in a ship of mine and worked in my warehouse as well as he was badly off Michael asked me to employ him and I sent him a voyage I deal in bottles In consequence of Smith s information I went to Kennet s house and saw a prickle and some bottles - it is such a prickle as I have in my warehouse and is bound round with spun-yarn as I generally do mine - Theophilus was not in my service that day and was not employed to carry any basket from my warehouse - Michael was in nobody s employ but mine he has been my foreman for three years but has been in my service longer than that - I sent for him into the house on this morning and told him the street-keeper had informed me some bottles had been taken from my warehouse to Kennet s and that his name was mentioned but I could not believe it - he said he was going up to be shaved I said You helped the man down with the basket - he said he did not but afterwards that he did I asked if he knew the man - he said perhaps he might he afterwards said perhaps he might have helped the man down with it - I then sent for the street-keeper up and said Is this the man who helped the man down with the basket he said it was - Michael then said Can you swear I am the man or words to that effect - I still had so good an opinion of him that I could not believe it I told him to go to work and I would see further into it I did not go to Kennet s place till after we found him on Tower-hill - I then found my basket there Kennet pointed out six dozens of bottles in a prickle but they had been washed I went back and gave Michael in charge The bottles were worth 19s 6d and the prickle 1s Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How many does a prickle hold A Six dozens but it will hold six more I bind my prickles all round with spun-yarn - they are usually bound in three or four places - I never saw any bound like mine I know all the bottle-merchants in London - there are about thirteen of us I do not believe there are more I found Michael at work as usual - there was nothing to prevent his escaping I gave him to understand that I wished to punish Kennet and of course he would get off if he became a witness I merely said I would punish the receiver - he did not refuse to become a witness he said he was innocent Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Was Theophilus present during any part of this conversation A No Michael gave me to understand the person was unknown to him The bottles would weight about 120lbs it would require assistance to be got off his shoulder WILLIAM KENNET I live at No 13 Dowgate-hill and am a wine-cooper and bottle-dealer I know Michael Cotton and have seen the other prisoner before I think but not to know any thing of him I think I have seen him before but am not sure On the 12th of January about twenty minutes or half-past eight o clock in the morning I was up at breakfast and thought I heard a ring at the bell I live on the first floor - I threw up the sash and there was the man at the door with a basket of bottles I saw Michael helping them off some other man s back - I went down and opened the door the man who brought them said there was a parcel of bottles for me I took them in and said I would look them over The man went away and I went up to breakfast Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you hear this case opened to-night A Yes - I heard the gentleman say if I did not swear what was expected of me I might go into some place not quite convenient - I understood him to mean Newgate I have come to speak the truth I dare say the gentlemen would send me to Newgate if they could but I do not think they can send me there - I have no doubt Mr Hillman would prosecute me if he could I did not know the things were stolen when baskets get old it is very common to bind them with rope-yarn I should think there were more than thirteen persons in the wholesale bottle trade but I do not know how many I had about ten gross of bottles in my place a great many were washed these were the same as other bottles I have seen many hundreds of prickles bound with spun-yarn in this manner COURT Q Did you point out any bottles to Mr Hillman A He asked what bottles had come in that morning and I showed him six dozen which had come in that prickle The prickle that Mr Hillman claimed stood among forty or fifty others - it was bound completely round he said he thought it was his but he could not swear to it I do not know that any of the others were bound - it is not here MR LAW Q In whose possession is it A I think it is in mine I was not asked by any body to bring it here -

Prince gave me the price I was to sell them at - I did not always get the price he fixed I have frequently spoken to Prince about how he got them he said they were stock that had been reserved at the time of the dissolution of partnership between Mr Hodson and Mr Cole - I understood him to mean that he had reserved them for himself - I always paid the money to Prince he said nothing about any danger in it that I recollect I have not seen him and Bond together above twice once at my house at Walworth and once we met Prince and went into a public-house in St Paul s-church-yard - I do not recollect any particular conversation between them the Lexicons were such as are produced I never sold any to any one else - Bond never asked me any question before he bought them the first I sold he gave me 2s for the second 1s 9d and after that 1s 6d -

some books were in the window Cross-examined by Mr ANDREWS Q You are a broker where is your shop A I keep no shop I lived in Walworth-villa for fourteen months before I was taken and had my name over my door there Q When this charge was first made was not Bond a witness against you A He brought the officers to my house there was a contention who should be the witness I heard him say something to the Magistrate about the price while I was at the bar I was before Sir Peter Laurie Bond was in custody though he was examined I carried the books in my hand - I might go about a hundred times I had 25 per cent for it I did not have half on my oath - his brother-in-law has seen me sell him books - he generally paid me at a public-house at the Blue Last Peter s-hill and another house in Thames-street he often got change there the best price he ever gave was 2s andthe lowest 1s 6d I knew Prince was only Cole s servant - I understood by the word reserve that he had stolen them I did not tell Bond they were stolen but he must know it by the marks on the papers I cannot point out which books I sold him - I frequently did not see them till Bond opened the paper parcels - he opened the papers and destroyed them - I never inquired what they sold for MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you know any thing about the books but what Prince told you A No I took them in the booksellers papers which were taken off and destroyed - they were in parcels marked and the marks taken off Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Are you married A Yes and have a family I was not in an extensive business but was not particularly pressed for money I had not left my family I do not live with my wife now nor have I for some years Mr Cole does not publish any other Lexicons -

the others were locked in a writing-desk the officers asked Bond how he came by them - he said he bought them of Lawrence a broker whom he had known and dealt with for two years and gave 2s 9d each for them he was asked if he had sold any to Mr Mason and denied it but named Ratcliffe a bookseller who he believed lived in the Borough he professed himself unable to say to whom else they had been sold but at last called Jem who was James Bartlett the officer asked him to whom he had sold them - and Tottenham-court-road being mentioned he named Tyler or Taylor as a person to whom some had been sold I believe Jem said so I think Bond said he had sold Ratcliffe half a dozen I believe the name of Clark of Paternoster-row was mentioned as having had some Boud denied all that we said I asked him what kind of broker Lawrence was he said he was a man who did business as he did by carrying round paper and other goods to customers of whom he was one he said he had spent about 50l with him in the course of two years the officer asked him if he had not told Mason that he got these books in payment for paper which the publishers could not always pay for in money he said he had not said so Bond was taken into custody we went over to Walworth to find Lawrence whose residence he said he could not exactly describe I staid in a coach and the officer brought Lawrence out - he was told to say nothing to hurt himself he named Prince as the person he had the books from and after some time admitted that he knew Prince was in Mr Cole s employ and named his residence we then went to the counter - he was asked what Bond had paid for the Lexicons he said 2s 6d and Bond said 2s 9d - Lawrence said nothing in answer I asked Bond if he had had a considerable number and believe I named five hundred - he said somewhere about sixty - Bond did not say a word to that - I believe all Bond said was that he only wished other people were as honest as himself - he said that to me in a low whisper Prince s name was mentioned and it was said at one time that Prince and Bond had met at Lawrence s house once but he denied any intimacy some of these books are very well bound Prince could take books at any time being the warehouseman through whose hands all books passed but nobody else could when Prince was going to be examined Mr Cole and I went into the Justice-room and I spoke to him before the Magistrate came he said he was very guilty he was ashamed to look Mr Cole in the face Cross-examined by Mr BARRY Q No particular property had been mentioned to him A I had spoken of the Lexicons - nobody could take them without his knowledge Cross-examined by Mr PRENDERGAST Q This book appears on the title-page to be published by Mr Cole A Yes - it was not printed when Mr Hodson was in the business the officer pressed Bond to go to find Lawrence I saw Jem go to the counter - he came to the Justice-room next morning - Lawrence was then at the bar - I brought the books away - the Ambulators were afterwards brought there Bond produced them before the Justice himself I believe Lawrence first said he sold some for 2s 6d Bond said 2s 9d these books have not been reduced in price - some works published since are reduced Bond informed where to find Laurence - Prince was then very ill Mr ADOLPHUS Q If a partnership was dissolved a proprietor would have a fresh title page A Yes - Bond was examined before Alderman Crowder and afterwards before Sir Peter Laurie Alderman Crowder sent him to obtain bail but Sir Peter Laurie committed him for felony COURT Q Did Bond himself give up the Ambulators A Yes - I had seen them at his premises but left them and could not swear to a book published by two people JOSEPH MARTIN I am an officer I went with Foster to Bond s house on Peter s-hill I looked in at the window and there saw five Lexicons nine Ambulators and three Prayer books I went in and asked the price of the Lexicons they said 3s 6d - Bond was not there then I asked for one better gilt the person in the shop then opened a desk which was full while I was looking at them Mr Maunder and Foster came in I then went up-stairs and staid about ten minutes when I came down I found Bond had come in and was talking to Foster I heard him ask if he had not sold some of them to Mason and told him he could sell them cheap having taken them for paper he said No I never did he then said Jem might have done it Bartlett was then called and said he had sold some to a person named Tyler I asked Bond who he bought them of - he said of Lawrence a broker - I asked what broker - he said neither a furniture broker nor a commission broker but a general broker I said it became him to say where he bought them as they were stolen - he said he did not know where he lived as he had only been there once I took a coach and went there I sent Bond to the door supposing he might get admission he knocked at the door and asked if Lawrence was at home they said Yes - we went into the room where three persons were and he pointed out Lawrence I said some Lexicons had been sold to Bond and asked if he had sold them - he said he had and there was one of them on the shelf - that he had them from a person named Prince who he believed was a binder who bought them in sheets and bound them for sale - that he lived in Princes-street Barbican on the right-hand side of the way we then came to town - I rode on the box there not being room inside Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Did Lawrence s account appear correct A Not quite Prince was not a bookbinder Jem said he had sold none to Mason but to Tyler and that a book which he had in his hand would shew what were sold JAMES THOMAS RATCLIFFE I am a stationer and live at No 75 Blackman-street Borough I bought seventy-one or seventy-two books of Bond at different times - there were about twenty-eight of these little Lexicons - the others were Bibles and Prayer books I paid 3s 6d for the Lexicons 3s 8d and 3s 9d for the Prayers - some Bibles from 10s to 12s - he said he had them in the way of barter and therefore could sell them cheap he said he got all the books in the same way - that he was accustomed to sell paper at the west end of the town and when they could not pay cash he took books in exchange - he said that in reference to these books but only once He stated that some bookbinders had got a quantity of the Lexicons in sheets in consequence of Mr Cole being unfortunate in trade and would be glad to sell them for the price of the binding to get rid of them he never stated to me that he gave a price but said he took them in barter I destroyed the marks on the Prayer books and Bbibles thinking they were old shopkeeper s marks Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Was this conversation more than once A I asked him several times were he got them I always considered him to bear a good character he deals extensively in paper HUGH HUGHES I am a bookseller and live in St Martin s-le-Grand I bought some little Lexicons of Bartlett Bond s brother-in-law - I gave 4s for one and 3s 6d for others MR COLE I have never been obliged to leave my books in the bookbinders hands because I could not pay them Rowley and Martin were employed to bind them Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Was there not a great depression in the trade A Yes I dare say many might be obliged to do so There was a mark in Roman characters on the papers my books were in GEO ROWLEY I never detained any of Mr Cole s books JOSEPH MARTIN I never detained any books Property produced and sworn to BOND s Defence Prince says Lawrence had half the money for what he had sold I have got his bills and he gave me a very good reference he called on me on the 27th of November 1825 and said You have seen me over the water I said Yes -

Taylor who had received the potatoes at the kitchen went with me I found a basket of potatoes concealed under the front of the shop window it was covered with one of our sacks but not one which had been sent that morning to the kitchen - Taylor who was with me pointed it out to me - I looked at them and said they were part of the last lot of potatoes sent to the City public-kitchen - I looked at them very particularly and there appeared to me to be just 2 cwt which was one sack - I believe on my oath that there were no more of such potatoes that day in London - Richards said they were not mine for she bought them in Thames-street - I told her there were no such potatoes sold in Thames-street she said she had them there and that a man brought themhome - I cannot recollect whether she said she bought them that day or not - I think she said she gave 6s a cwt for them the price was 7s Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q Did she say a man brought them from Thames-street A She said she purchased them in Thames-street of a man who brought them there - they were what are called Wellington potatoes - we sell all the potatoes that grow on that farm - there may be other Wellington potatoes in London but not of that sort and quality - they grew at a place called Mind Island in the parish of Dagenham - I believe there were no such in London - I had seen them that morning shot out of the sacks they came from the country in here are some of them Richards lives at the top of the court near the City public-kitchen I do not know the name of it it is the first turning on the left hand beyond St Paul s church-yard on St Andrew s-hill she keeps a green-shop and sells potatoes and vegetables Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Do you go to Spitalfields-market A I live there but I am not the only potatoe merchant there Three or four of our men wear red caps and I dare say others may but I never noticed any other carters wearing them in my life MR PRENDERGAST Q How do you know these potatoes A By the particular soil they grew in and they are a particular sort of Wellington potatoes - it has been a bad season for them and most potatoes have grown at twice but these were all of one growth I said nothing to Crawley about the sacks when he left my premises WILLIAM TOLLEY I am in the employ of Mr Gregory On the 28th of March I went out with the prisoner with the waggon he had a red night-cap on and a flannel jacket such as he has on now - there were twenty sacks of potatoes in the waggon - we were to drive them to the City public-kitchen - I do not know the name of the place it is in the waggon stopped on St Andrew s-hill I untied the first sack and he took it up Ireland-yard when he returned he took another sack another way he was gone about two minutes with the first and when he came back he said there was such a mob the front way that he would carry the other the back way and he was gone about five minutes with that he took all the other sacks throught Ireland-yard I could not see down the yard as I was in the waggon I did not hear any noise of a mob I went to the kitchen before the waggon went away I went by Ireland-yard to it the prisoner told me he had pitched twelve sacks there and shot eight we went and had some beer and then went home with the waggon Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q The first sack you opened yourself A Yes and the second I do not know that the way he took the second sack was the back way to the kitchen he said so MR ADOLPHUS Q How came you to untie the sacks A He told me to do so there were no others untied I had a fustian jacket corduroy trousers and a leather cap on James Farrel was with us - he had a flannel jacket and a hat on Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Do not you work in Spitafield-smarket A Yes - I see a great many men there in red caps and flannel jackets the first sack I opened went the straight road to the kitchen COURT Q What do you mean by opening the sacks A To make them ready for shooting - but that should not be done before they got to the place - there were eight empty sacks brought back by the prisoner and the other man JAMES FARREL I am in the service of Mr Gregory On the 28th of March I went with the prisoner to St Andrew s-hill the waggon was stopped at the but of the hill I carried the first sack to the kitchen - the prisoner carried the second I always met the prisoner the right way as I was going with the sack or coming back I had no red cap on I cannot say whether the prisoner had Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q You say you carried the first sack A Yes - and he the other I always met him regularly COURT Q Did you meet him at all when he came back from delivering the second sack as you were coming back from delivering the first A I never missed him at all out of the way but I cannot say I observed one sack more than another if I had missed him out of the way when I had delivered my first sack it would have appeared strange - there was no reason why I should not meet him that first time - I always met him - I took the first sack out of the waggon he took the next and we went on regularly - there were a number of persons serving out the victuals in the kitchen - I took the third sack the prisoner the fourth and I met him JURY Q If the prisoner had gone any other than the direct way should you have met him A I do not know but I met him with the full sack when I was returning with the empty one when I had shot them there is only one door to the kitchen COURT Q Did you deliver the potatoes in the kitchen A Yes there are two doors to the kitchen JOHN WESTON I am a box-maker and live at No 11 St Andrew s-hill - the City public-kitchen is in New-street Blackfriars - a waggon cannot drive close to it - they generally stop at the corner of Ireland-yard or in Shoemaker-row - the way to the kitchen is to go up Ireland-yard but there is another way up Green Dragon-court up Gloucester-court and so into Ireland-yard again- the distance up Ireland-yard may he about thirty yards - I should think the other is one hundred On the morning of the 28th of March I saw the waggon of potatoes at the corner of Ireland-yard but did not notice whose it was - the horses were down the hill - I met a man in Green Dragon-court with a sack on his back which was untied at the month - he had a light coloured jacket on and a red night-cap - he was going up Green Dragon-court the longest way to the City kitchen - I know the shop of Richards the prisoner - one door of it comes into Gloucester-court and the other into Ireland-yard - he had not got to the shop when I saw him - I spoke to a person and in consequence of what I said Mary Hart was desired to take notice of the man - this was between eleven and twelve o clock Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q When was it that you saw the waggon A A quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before I left my work in my shop - I did not observe whether it was there when I left the shop as I had not occasion to pass it - my house is at the corner of Green Dragon-court and I went up that court Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q You say the short way is about thirty yards and the longest about one hundred A Yes Mrs Hart takes in washing - she does not sell vegetables nor do I - I said to her I should like to know where that man is going and she followed him MR ADOLPHUS Q Where were you going A To a house at the top of Green Dragon-court and in going I turned my face to the waggon till I got into the court and then I should he turned from it - I had seen the waggon before and when I came back again I staid about ten minutes MARY HART I was in Green Dragon-court on the 28th of March - I saw Weston there In consequence of what he said I noticed a man who was passing with a sack of potatoes on his back he had a jacket on and a red nightcap - he went into the new shop Mrs Richards shop - one part of it is in Ireland-yard and the other in Gloucester-court - it has two doors - I saw him go into that shop with the potatoes but I did not wait Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q You called it the new shop A Yes because it has lately been opened - Mrs Richards had just gone there - I did not know I was to look after the person for any thing particular - I merely saw him go into the shop COURT Q You was desired to look at the man and you saw his cap and his jacket A Yes but I took no notice of his person I do not know whether he was young or old I did not see his face I merely left word where he was gone JOSEPH POTTER I am a constable On the 28th of March I saw the waggon near the City public-kitchen between twelve and one o clock there were two men carrying out potatoes and a boy was in the waggon the prisoner was one of the men - he was dressed as he is now and had a red cap on I afterwards heard something and went to the kitchen I saw a great quantity of potatoes there I did not take any of them away I afterwards went with Taylor to Richards to see if I could find potatoes there this was in consequence of what I heard from Hart or Weston I told Richards that there was an oration round the parish that a sack of potatoes had been taken into her shop she denied it - we then began to search and a hamper of potatoes was found under the counter - I told her I had heard that a sack of potatoes had been brought into her shop by a man in a red cap instead of being taken to the City public-kitchen - she said there had been no such thing brought there but I found them covered with a sack in the hamper they were under the counter and behind it a person coming into the shop could not see them - the counter was enclosed on one side and open on the other the potatoes were in the mould and seemed damp I could not tell whether they had been there long Taylor who was with me said they were the potatoes that belonged to the City public-kitchen Richards made no reply to that - I waited till all the potatoes were delivered and the prisoner Crawley had put on a hat I took him up to Weston s door but neither he nor Hart were at home I let him go and took the name and number of the waggon - I afterwards saw the prisoners in custody Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q You found these potatoes in the shop A Yes - Taylor went there with me that was a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I had seen the waggon standing - I said You have got a sack of potatoes which ought to have been carried to the City public-kitchen she said she had not I do not know whether a red night-cap is worn by persons who carry loads when I saw the prisoner he had a slouch hat on I did not see any one who had a red night-cap carrying them MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you say any thing about the man who came with the potatoes A I said it was a man with a red night-cap it was after I had been to her shop that I saw the potatoes were not quite delivered I saw Crawley carry a sack or two of them up to the kitchen - he had his night-cap on then he afterwards put on his hat and drove the waggon JOHN TAYLOR I am an assistant at the City public-kitchen - it is a charitable institution for the poor On the 28th of March I saw some potatoes come there two tons should have come - I do not know how many did come - I did not count them - it was not my place but when they brought in some and shot them down I said to the prisoner and the other man How many have you brought in - they said four sacks a piece I said I thought there were but seven altogether the rest they pitched in the sacks as they brought them in I went to Richards house with Potter - I saw her and said to her I understand you have had some potatoes brought in here she said No I have not I said You certainly have - she said These are all the potatoes I have got I said These are not the right sort - these are not the kitchen potatoes I looked about and coming away towards the door I stopped and under the board I saw some potatoes like those which had been shot out - they were in a large basket and covered over with a sack under the showboard I said to her These are the potatoes she said I bought them at the wharf she went into the room and I went away I was present in the kitchen there was not such a crowd as to prevent any person getting to the kitchen conveniently Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q Did you go with the constable A Yes I went in first - he came in immediately after me I do not know whether he heard what I said - it is a large room it is parted off from the shop as a kind of sitting-room I said These are the same sort of potatoes that went to the kitchen I did not say You have got some of the potatoes that came from the kitchen or ought to have gone to the kitchen COURT Q Did you say at first It is reported that you have got some of the potatoes that ought to have come to the kitchen A Yes Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Is it not your business to attend to the quantity of potatoes A No I said I thought they had only brought in seven sacks and they said eight CHARLES HERDSFIELD I am an officer of Guildhall I went to Richards on Friday the 30th of March I saw her daughter but did not see her till she was at Guildhall -

I took him to Guildhall and it was too late - the Alderman was gone - I took him the next day but Richards did not attend till the day after that Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q Then it was on the 30th that the potatoes were taken out of her basket A Yes Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Did you know of any report about the potatoes being taken from the kitchen A No I could not hear that at Spitalfields Eleven witnesses gave Richards a good character CRAWLEY -

t18270913-41  First London Jury - before Mr Recorder 1629 GEORGE SANDERSON was indicted for stealing on the 31st of July 4 quires of paper value 5s and I quire of other paper value 10d the goods of John Green and another his masters and JOHN BEWICK was indicted for feloniously receiving the same well knowing it to have been stolen MR ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution GEORGE JORDAN I am clerk to Messrs Green tea and coffee dealers of Gracechurch-street - their business is mostly wholesale - I have been with them nearly two years I found Sanderson there when I first went and understood from him that he had been there nearly fifteen years Soon after I went there Sanderson told me that if I was short of cash I was to sell coffee or tea and apply the money to my own use for what I was deficient I said nothing to that I told Mr Henry Green of it about a week afterwards or it might be more Soon after the prosecutors kept a more diligent watch over their property and in about four months had pedlocks put on all their cannisters Q Before the 24th of July do you remember some paper coming in A Yes one ream of thin blue and one ream of thin white we use it to pack tea and coffee for the retail trade only - it would last a long time as we have very little retail business it was placed on a back shelf near the bottom of the counter - Sanderson had access to it On the 24th I made this memorandum of the paper in hand - there were sixteen quires of blue fifteen of white and eight of brown which we call bag-cap on the 27th I looked again there were fourteen of blue twelve of white and seven of bag-cap we had not cut up any of that paper for bags or any thing nor had we used any of it what became of the rest I cannot say but none of it had been used in the business whatever - it could not have been taken for the business without my knowledge nor could any such quartity have been consumed in business in so few days Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q When did you enter the prosecutors service A On the 27th of October 1825 Sanderson made the communication to me within a month or six weeks I told Mr Green about a week afterwards - Sanderson remained in their service till July last there are four servants in all including myself there is a female and a boy beside me and Sanderson - the female had no access to the shop Mr Henry Green was always in the business and Mr John occasionally - it is Sanderson s duty to make the bags I sleep in the house the paper was kept on an open shelf - the shop is locked up at eight o clock at night and I kept the key the servants have access to the paper in the day time but I can tell what would be used the boy or Sanderson could take it when they wanted it - I swear it had not been used in the business MR ADOLPHUS Q Could such a quantity be used without your knowledge A It could not it would take a long time to make it into bags and we never use it for bags - I had a particular reason for taking down the quantity there I travel sometimes - but was not out during this time COURT Q On the 24th of July was there a stock of bags so as not to require more to be made A Yes the bags are made of cartridge paper - not of this sort MR WILLIAM GREEN I am a stationer and live in Clement s-lane and am the eldest son of Mr Green I supply the paper for the business - in July last I sent them a ream of double crown blue and one of double wove yellow and some other papers in consequence of what was said to me I advised Jordan what to do about the paper - I have since seen some paper produced it is impossible to swear to paper - but to the hest of my judgment it corresponds in every particular and I believe it to be part of the reams which I delivered them it is of the same quality size fabric and from the same maker - I compared it with what was left there was no wrapper on it Cross-examined Q How long have you supplied them with paper A About seven years I have sold them agreat quantity in that time I called there about ten minutes after it was delivered - I saw it on the floor of their warehouse I do not deal with several manufacturers - the same maker supplies other people no doubt - I will not swear that the paper had ever been in my possession the blue was charged 27s a ream and the white about 25s MR ADOLPHUS Q Do the prosecutors have as much paper as a retail dealer would take A Much less I suppose two or three reams of each sort of this paper would be more than their supply for the year JURY Q Are they machine or hand papers A I believe these are not machine paper the edge of machine paper is cut and hand paper is not MR JOHN GREEN I am in partnership with my son Henry Sanderson had been about fifteen years in our employ and was confidentialy employed till I had reason to suspect him - I am seldom in town In July last in consequence of what came to my knowledge I called him into the counting-house about three o clock in the afternoon - it was on a Tuesday towards the end of the month I desired Mr Jordan to repeat in his presence what he had said to me he said he had lost several quires of paper I had made him no promise of forgiveness or said any thing at all to him Jordan said he had missed five quires of paper - that he had taken an account every morning of what there was for several days and every day had missed some the prisoner was silent or said he knew nothing about it I forget which I then said there was a rogue in the house and that he was the man I observed that he shook a little he said he knew nothing about it I persisted that it was him and at last he acknowledged that he had taken it and if I would look over it he would do so no more and would pay me for what he had taken I told him that would not be done - that it was not that alone but I had to accuse him of a great many other things as he must be aware of - he denied any thing else I saw him again before I went out and asked what he had done with the paper - he said he had sold it and after some hesitation he said he sold it to a man in Lime-street without naming him and got 6d a quire for it after some further conversation I sent for Wiltshire the officer I then said Will you tell this officer where you have sold the paper he named the man soon after two officers left the place with him I went out of town and next morning I saw the paper at the Mansion-house - it appeared in every respect part of the paper missing Jordan produced two quires of the paper and it appeared to me to be the same Cross-examined Q Do you take an active part in the business A Not now nor did I in 1825 MR HENRY GREEN I am in partnership with my father soon after Jordan came into our employ he made a communication to me respecting Sanderson and after that I had frequently missed property in small quantities which could hardly be missed at the time I had a padlock put on the large tea cannisters I afterwards missed other things there was paper missing in July last the circumstance was mentioned to me on the 27th I ordered the paper to be counted daily - but I believe that was done before when I was out of town - I was not present at the conversation with Sanderson so as to give a particular account of it Cross-examined Q Had something been said to you about a half-crown piece Yes I never heard my father say he should be forgiven if he made a communication Jordan gave me information within a month of the time when he came I missed property the next day and almost daily afterwards MR ADOLPHUS Q What was your reason for keeping Sanderson A I wished positively to discover who the thief was and not to accuse any body improperly the deprodations were always trifling but the whole together was considerable WILLIAM WILTSHIRE I am a City officer On Tuesday the 31st of July I went from Messrs Greens with Sanderson - he took me to the house of Bewick No 30 Lime-street Dealer in marine-stores is written over the door the stock chiefly consisted of old iron rags and such things - when we came to the door the prisoner Bewick was in the back part of the passage Sanderson said That is the man I sold the paper to I went up to Bewick and said Where is the paper you purchased of this man Bewick answered I never bought any of him he then opened the door and we went into the shop which is a dark place backwards I again said Now where is the paper you bought of this person he said I never bought any of him Sanderson said Yes you bought some of me yesterday Bewick then took up some loose sheets of paper which laid on the top of a quire of brown and a quire of white which I produce Sanderson then took hold of the two quires and said This is the paper I then took Bewick and the paper into custody Q Were the two quiros concealed from view A No it might he seen under the loose cloth I have had it ever since - Mr Green saw it at the Mansion-house he compared and claimed it Cross-examined Q From first to last he denied buying it of Sanderson A He did his shop is on the ground floor - he opened an inner door to admit us - but when I first saw him in the passage he slammed that door too - there might be more paper in the place but I did not search for more - this was all Sanderson pointed out - he did not say in Bewick s presence what he sold it him for MR WILLIAM GREEN I believe the paper produced is the same as these samples from the bulk - there is no water-mark but from the texture quality and colour I believe it to be the same it is worth 1s 3d a quire - the brown also agrees in every respect and is worth 10d or 1s a quire Cross-examined Q How many thousand quires you may have sold in a year you cannot say A I supply nobody but my father with that sort of paper - the manufacturer may sell a large quantity The prisoner Bewick put in a written defence denying most solemnly that he had ever purchased a single sheet of paper of Sanderson stating that he dealt in paper which he had witnesses to prove and that he regularly purchased of wholesale dealers JOHN PERKINS I am a wholesale stationer and carry on business at Bull Wharf-lane Thames-street I have dealt with Bewick and sold him paper of different sorts at different times bag-cap and small-hand I do not know that I ever sold him any like that produced small hand is about half the size of this I may probably have sold him paper like that produced but not lately - not withinthe last three years I should think this bag-cap is heavier than what I have sold him - it is impossible to identify bagcap - the maker could not do it not to distinguish one sheet from another MR ADOLPHUS Q When did you sell him any paper at all A About three months ago I sold him bag-cap small-hand and lumber-hand - it is perhaps five years since I have sold him any of the sort produced I believe I have sold it within seven years but not within five I sold him some paper about one month before I sold the bag-cap - I generally sold him a ream or a bundle at a time - I do not believe any of this paper to have been sold by me BENJAMIN PEWTRISS I am a stationer and live at No 5 Russell-street Mile-end-road I have sold Bewick some paper I am what is termed a jobber my cousin in Gracechurch-street is a wholesale dealer I have sold the prisoner some bag-cap I have sold him some white paper like this of this fineness and quality - it was machine cut and so is this I have sold him some quires of it some reams or bundles I should say - I will not swear that this is the paper I sold him but it was similar I defy any manufacturer to swear to a single quire of paper I have sold him some bag-cap like this but after it goes out of my hand I cannot swear to it Mr ADOLPHUS Q When did you sell him any bagcap A I think about the middle of July - I have not brought my books here - I was not desired - I generally sell for ready money - I do not deliver invoices - I take it my self and receive the money I think I sold him three bundles one of bag-cap and two of this sort which is double crown - I believe this is machine cut I bought my paper of my cousin in July last - I bought about 25l worth altogether but not more of this sort than I sold to Bewick - this paper is similar to that I will swear it is the same quality - it is as near the size as can be - I cannot swear to half an inch - it was about the 10th of July MR BARRY Q I suppose you have sometimes sent him invoices A I have COURT Q Did you appear at the Mansion-house when Bewick was under examination A No I was not desired to attend W WILTSHIRE re-examined Bewick was remanded from the Wednesday till the Friday to bring forward invoices of the party whom he said he bought the paper of SANDERSON -

the prosecutor applied to me and about nine o clock in the morning of the 22d of October I saw Wright come out of their premises - I followed him from there into a court in the Old Bailey opposite Newgate - I waited on the Newgate side and saw him go into a house I presently observed a woman come out with a jug and go to a wine-vaults - she went into the court again and went into the same house Wright came out and I followed him into Smithfield - I then went towards Fish and Collins and met Mr Collins I then took Wright into custody and took him to the watch-house I found tobacco dust in his waistcoat and breeches pockets - I locked him up and returned to the house in the court and found Nightingale in a room up two pair of stairs I said Nightingale you have some tobacco here which a man has just brought he said no man had been there I said Have you any tobacco in the house he said Yes and shewed me a jar with about one pound and a half in it I said Is this all you have he said I have got a little more I then went to the cupboard and found about 3lbs more which was warm I searched further but found nothing more - I saw a jug on the table with a little gin in it it was like that which the woman had I asked if he dealt in tobacco he said Yes - I said Who do you buy it of he said of a man at Chelsea or Chelmsford I do not know which I asked for his permit - he said he had none - I asked if he was a retailer - he said Yes - I asked if he had a licence he said No I then took him in charge Wright lodges in Coleman-street St Luke s Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q How many houses are there in the court A Two or three I believe it is called Green Harbour-court I cannot say how many - my eye was only directed to one house I stood about fifty yards off I had a reason for not following him Wright had a tobacco box in his pocket I found 1s on him he had left the court five or seven minutes before I searched him Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q How long have you been an officer A Some years I live in Brick-lane I was never in the court but once before I think there are only two or three houses there Wright had a blue coat trousers and an apron I saw nothing about him I do not think his coat was buttoned up he might have tobacco about him and I not see him I have put the tobacco altogether he could not have 3lbs I think COURT Q Would not the greater part of it go into two large breeches pockets A I should think so his apron hung down before him WILLIAM COLLINS I am a tobacco manufacturer and live in St John-street in partnership with Samuel Fish the prisoner Wright was employed in the finishing department of our manufactory On the morning of the 22d of October I went with Keys to the house in the court in the Old Bailey and saw Nightingale Keys said he had come for some tobacco which he had just received - he said he had none and that no man had been there Keys said he must know of some which had just been brought he then produced a small parcel Keys said You have more than this he said I have a little more and then produced more in a jar Keys said it was warm I put my hand to it and found it so we had been drying tobacco that morning which would produce that sort of heat we never send it out in that state this tobacco is all alike and I have no doubt of it being ours I can tell it by the smell and flavour I believe it to be ours we manufactures by a peculiar process and this is of a peculiar flavour Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Will you swear that it came from your place A I have no doubt of it being ours I examined it at the time we sell large quantities it does not adhere to the hands by being handled the men usually wash their hands when they leave work I have handled a good deal but never found it come off my hands by putting into my pocket a man might have a particle stick to his hands we allow each man 11/2 ozs every Saturday night it is our practice to search our men but it is not always done Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q What is the name of this court A Littlewood-court I believe - there is only a few houses there it leads down from the coach-stand - I was not present all the time Keys was talking to Nightingale when Keys said it was warm he said It is because it stands near the fire it was not near enough to arquire that heat - I think I should have known it to be mine if I had seen it any where promiscuously - Wright generally wears an apron MR QUIN Q How much might a person carry A I think he might carry 3 lbs in his breeches if his apron was down without it being seen except from being warm that tobacco would be the same as the parcel WRIGHT s Defence I went out with a man named Clark that morning if I had tobacco about me the witness must have seen it NIGHTINGALE s Defence When they came to my house I showed the tobacco very readily -

t18271206-47  47 ROBERT COLEMAN was indicted for stealing on the 6th of November 5000lbs of iron value 14l 10s the goods of Alexander Galloway his master and GEORGE DAVIDSON was indicted for feloniously receiving the same well-knowing it to have been stolen MR A PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution MR RICHARD GALLOWAY I am the son of Mr Alexander Galloway whose factory is in West-street Smithfield the prisoner Davidson was our clerk it was part of his duty to receive the iron which came into the factory to see that it corresponded with the invoice and enter it in a book Coleman was our carman - it was his duty to fetch iron from the wharf On the 6th of November he was employed in fetching iron from Messrs Drew s wharf Steel-yard Upper Thames-street to my father s premises he brought on the 6th of November to my father s premises two single horse-loads about 25 cwt In consequence of the information which Mr Carden gave me that day I went to Mr Dobell s yard in St John s-street and from the information which I got there I went to Llewellyn s in Cow-cross I then returned to our manufactory and saw the prisoner Coleman just entering the yard with a load of iron I called him into my father s office this was before twelve o clock - I did not hold him out any promise or threat whatever I asked how many loads of iron he had brought that morning from the Steel-yard he said he had brought in three loads that morning - I knew myself he had brought but two for I had seen him deliver one load and he was then bringing another in- he had left the premises about half-past seven o clock in the morning he delivered one load about nine and it was between eleven and twelve when I questioned him Q Was the time taken in the delivery of these two loads more than usual A It certainly was considerably longer than he should have been he said this was the third load I denied that he had brought in two previous to the one then in the yard after hesitating a little he said the one he had just brought in was only the second I asked if he had been any where else with any iron that morning from the Steel-yard he said he had not I then asked whether he had not taken a load to Mr Dobell s yard in St John s-street he said Yes he had I asked by whose orders he said by Mr Davidson s I asked whether he had received any money from Mr Davidson for having conveyed any iron that morning by his orders he said he had received no other money but 2l - 1l on the former week and 1l on the day before which was Monday he did not say what iron he had received it for but that he had received but 2l from Davidson I saw Davidson and asked him how many loads had been delivered that morning by Coleman he also said there had been three delivered by him and that the load then in the yard made the third I then asked whether he had given Coleman orders to take iron to Dobell s yard he said he had I asked if he had given him any money for conveying that iron he said he had given him 1l yesterday but I had stated the two transactions together Q In what way were orders given to your carman A When we have a quantity of iron at the wharf it has happened that after I have given a written order for the delivery of the whole that Davidson has given a verbal order for a single load if iron was to go any where without coming to to the premises it should be weighed at the wharf and a delivery and receipt note made out - that is the invariable practice Davidson said there was no note on this occasion and Coleman said so also Q Was the authority of Davidson sufficient for the carman to deliver iron A Certainly not I went to Dobell s yard in the afternoon after this conversation I also went before the Magistrate at Guildhall then to the stables of a man named Birmingham in Sharp s-alley Cow-cross and there found a quantity of Madely-wood pig-iron with that name cast on it I took it away in our cart - it weighed about 30 cwt odd it corresponded in quality with that at the wharf and had the name on it - I had given the carman a written order for the conveyance of the Madely-wood iron from the wharf he was to bring the whole to our manufactory and did bring it there previous to the 6th of November Cross-examined by Mr ADOLPHUS Q You have not got the order here A No it was given to him to deliver to Messrs Drew s my inquiry about the iron in the former case was also on the 6th of November the conversation was kept up some time and we were separated before it concluded Coleman was separated from Davidson - I had taken one into another room the prisoners situation had not been altered while they were in our employ the iron in question was the first that I questioned Coleman about he did not say he had delivered one load by order of Davidson till I asked him the question Q Did he not say he had delivered two at the yard and one by his order at another place A Yes MR PHILLIPS Q Which of the two transactions took place first A This is the first I questioned him about the other iron was first taken but it was not discovered till the 6th of November JAMES REYNOLDS I am in the employ of Messrs Drew and Co at the Steel-yard On Tuesday the 6th of November I assisted in placing three loads of pig-iron into Mr Galloway s cart I do not know the name of the iron- I delivered it to his servant Cross-examined Q I suppose you have an immense quantity of iron there A We had a quantity of iron belonging to Mr Galloway but at that time had no pigiron but what did belong to him I delivered the first load to Coleman about eight o clock or a little after WILLIAM COWDERY I am servant to Mr Dobell of St John s-street he has stables in Peter s-lane and keeps a place for killing cattle On Tuesday the 6th of November I remember Coleman bringing some iron to the yard in a cart with Mr Galloway s name on it he shot it down in the yard I asked whose iron it was he said the man would be there presently it remained there about an hour and a half and was removed in a cart which came for it I do not know the name of the man who fetched it Davidson was present when it was fetched - he said nothing to me - he spoke to Mr Carden about it what he said I do not know - I saw the horse and cart which brought it and the driver the same day opposite the Ram Iun Smithfield with some iron Mr Carden rented premises for drying bacon in Dobell s-yard I had never seen iron brought to the yard but once before ISAAC DOBELL I keep the Black Bull public-house St John s-street On Tuesday the 6th of November about nine o clock I was called up and saw this iron down in the middle of the yard I did not know who brought it or or whom it belong to I immediately ordered Cowderoy to go and inquire who it belonged to and ordered it immediately to be removed as it stopped the passage of carts into the yard Davidson came up to me afterwards and I quarrelled with him about bringing the iron there I told him hemight as well take possession of my yard and house at once as to put iron there without my leave he said it should be removed Cross-examined Q There was a great deal of iron there was there not A Only this the other had been moved about a week or more before my yard is in Middlesex - I do not know who moved the iron away COURT Q Was Mr Carden there A Yes the whole time because it stopped his cart from coming in nothing passed between them while I was there MR CARDEN I am a cheesemonger and live in Newgate-street - I rent premises in Dobell s-yard On Tuesday morning the 6th of November I saw this iron in the yard Davidson was talking to Dobell when I first saw him and after Dobell left I saw him giving directions to a carman to convey away some iron which I had complained of as being in the way of our carts I did not know him before I heard in the yard in whose employ he was I inquired of him what was the value of the iron which was then loading in the cart - he said from 5l to 6l a ton I asked if he was a dealer in iron he said he was - that the lease of his own premises had expired and he had engaged Dobell s yard to put his iron in In consequence of what I saw I went and informed Mr Galloway Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Was it Coleman who was removing it A No ISAAC DOBELL re-examined I had had no conversawith Davidson about taking my yard I was angry with him for placing the iron there - BIRMINGHAM I am a jobbing carman and have a stable in Sharp s-alley Cow-cross Middlesex On Tuesday the 6th of November Davidson came to me as I was waiting for a job and asked if my horse was engaged I said No he said Will you go and move a load of iron for me I harnessed my horse and he took me to Dobell s yard he walked before me to show me the way - I there found the iron - he told me to back the cart up and begin to load which I did I put it all into the cart and asked him where I was to go with it we went over to Greenhill s-rents I asked where I was going with it he said The lease of my premises is expired and I will give you 1s to let it remain in your place it was deposited in my place MR R GALLOWAY I saw the iron on this man s premises and moved it by our cart to our manufactory we had about 30 cwt and it was the same sort as we had at Drew s Cross-examined Q Nobody else has that sort of iron I suppose A Oh Yes we never sold any we work it up it was worth 7l or 8l a ton ALEXANDER GALLOWAY ESQ I am proprietor of the premises in West-street On the 6th of November Coleman was in my employ and was sent to fetch iron from the Steel-yard I recollect seeing him about the middle of the day - I asked him how many loads he had brought that day - he said Two - I said Only two - he then attempted to hesitate and at last reluctantly acknowledged it was three - I then asked him if he had delivered those three loads in our yard - he again hesitated and again reluctanty acknowledged that he had taken one load somewhere else and after a good deal of trouble he acknowledged he had taken it to Dobell s in St John s-street - I called Davidson into the counting-house that day in consequence of a communication from Mr Carden relative to some iron - I communicated my suspicions to him and he acknowledged that he had directed Coleman to take the Madely-wood iron and subsequently he acknowledged that he had directed him to take two loads of the other iron Q Confine yourself to the Madely-wood iron - did you see Davidson in company with Coleman A I did and he accused Coleman of having received 2l of him for conveying iron to Dobell s yard - he said he was to give him 1l a load - Coleman at first denied it but at last acknowledged that he had paid him 2l Cross-examined Q Was your son there at the time A He was I was at home this morning when the last case was tried I heard of the verdict - I cannot say whether my son was present during the whole of the conversation - I believe he went out once or twice - I am sure he was not present the whole time - I have no partner and am sole proprietor of the business COLEMAN S Defence written I am unfortunately brought to this bar for an offence of which I can assure you I am perfectly innocent if I have done wrong to my worthy master it has been through ignorance and under the impression that I was bound to obey the commands of George Davidson clerk and superintendant of Mr Galloway s manufactery who was my superior in education and situation and further I might have lost my situation which would have brought distress upon my dear wife and family of small children together with myself I therefore was obedient to all and every one of his commands On one occasion I certainly asked him a question at which he seemed offended and morosely said Did Mr Galloway order you to obey me or not I answered him Yes He immediately said Then obey my commands which I was forced to do under the pain and penalty of losing my situation Gentlemen you will see by this statement that I had no will of my own but my will was to obey the commands of my superiors mine being a menial station in life in which I was at the command of all my superiors one of which was Mr George Davidson therefore you will please to take my hard case into your serious consideration as I am no scholar and not qualified for any higher or better situation therefore I cannot be so much to blame as might appear had I not have laid this statement of my injured case before you - Gentlemen of the Jury 1 beg leave to thank you for your kind attention and hope you will consider of this my unfortunate case and restore me to my disconsolate wife and family of small children who are wholly dependent on my small efforts for their daily support and thus I throw myself upon the mercy of the Court Both the prisoners received a good character COLEMAN -

I do not know were they went to - I afterwards received a letter and wrote to London I received another letter from a Mr Caldecot the day following in consequence of which I came to London and arrived on Monday week while Burrowes was in my service I never sold him a large quantity of my stock COURT Q Could he have had a quantity of your stock in his possession without your knowledge A No he never purchased more than 6l worth of property of me including the Irish linen and some trifling articles ELIZABETH DREW I was servant at the Black Swan public-house at Bath I recollect Isaacs coming there about six weeks before Christmas - he went by the name of Adlam he came with Burrowes between seven and eight o clock one Sunday morning - there was no one up in the house but me it had rained in the night Adlam was very wet and went to bed After Burrowes was gone a box came which was taken to Adlam s bed-room and the next day I saw it on the table - I opened it and saw in it only a pair of trousers and three shirts - I took it off the table in the course of the week I saw some clean papers on the bed I opened them and saw some black silk in them - I saw the box in the room but the room was always kept locked and if I did not make the bed before he went out I did it when he came home - on the Saturday before he left I moved his box to clean the room and found it very heavy I opened it and saw it was full and the top goods were silk - Burrowes had frequently been in the week to see Adlam and called Adlam his friend On the morning Adlam went away he sent me to Mr Rose s for a cap and cloak and to tell Burrowes that he was going - I saw Burrowes who gave me the cloak and cap - Burrowes slept at our house on the night he left his situation Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q You say Burrowes came frequently A Yes almost every day in the week at all times in the day - our house is three or four minutes walk from Mr Rose s he lives in Bond-street I had not seen him at the Black Swan before Adlam came but it was known he lived with Mr Rose and I never saw Burrowes bring any thing to the Black Swan Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You made Adlam s bed A Yes his box had no lock any one who entered the room might have opened it but no one went in but me STEPHEN GILBERT I was porter at the Christopher Inn at Bath I removed a box from the Black Swan to the stage for Adlam on the 5th of November between eight and nine o clock in the morning - I took it to the Stage Coach Company I cannot say whether it was put on the coach or in the boot - I saw Adlam leave on the same coach for London Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you see it on the coach or in the boot A I cannot say it went away with Mr Adlam - it was not locked but corded MR ADOLPHUS Q Who gave it you A The servant at the Black Swan I packed the coach and other parcels - I put the box in the coach-office is about three minutes walk from the Black Swan COURT Q You cannot say whether it was in or out of the coach A No but Adlam was a passenger - I loaded the coach with the passenger s luggage I cannot say what was the weight of the box - it was quite heavy SAMUEL WITHERS I am a linen-draper s assistant I know both the prisoners I first had a slight acquaintance with them about twenty-one months or two years ago Burrowes was then a town traveller to a house in the City I understood from him it was Mr Grimshy of Huggin-lane Adlam was then a linen-draper s assistant like myself I understood his name was Isaacs till he told me he had changed it to Adlam we were both out of situations I did not know of Burrowes going to Bath but on the 26th of December last I met him in Sydney s-alley I asked him if he was in a situation he said No he had justcome up from Weymouth and from Bath - I went with him to a public-house in a street at the corner of Leicester-square and from there we walked to the Old Bailey in going along he said he was always open to buy a quantity of goods so long as they were cheap I think he said to the amount of 30l or 40l he said he had a quantity of lace goods which he was going to sell and he was going to the New Inn to fetch them - I had told him I was in want of a situation he wished me to go to the New Inn with him but I said I had an engagement in the City and he said if I would meet him at the Dolphin public-house in Milk-street in half an hour he would be with me - he did not say for what purpose we parted about one o clock I went to the Dolphin he came there and brought a brown paper parcel which I understood was the lace he brought from the New Inn he did not tell me so - I wished to look at it and opened one end of the parcel I saw several cards of lace in it a little soiled in bad condition there was a young man named Oliver there we then went away and walked to the pavement Moorfields we went to a coffee-house at the corner of Fore-street and Burrowes went out leaving Oliver with me he returned in ten minutes and said that a young man in the shop named Bennett wished to see me and said he had left the goods there - I went to the shop it was about ten doors off and Bennett showed me a quantity of lace in a basket it was the same lace as I had seen in the parcel - I returned to the coffee-house but did not tell Burrowes what Bennett had said to me We then went to the New Inn and staid there till twelve o clock at night Burrowes told me he lodged there - I called on him there the next day about three o clock I staid about an hour when he went to bed and I went away - I saw him again at ten o clock the same night and we went to a masquerade at the Argyll Rooms I was with him all that night we went from the masquerade to a place called The Finish in Covent-garden at seven o clock in the morning I saw him again that night which was Friday at the New Inn as he was going to bed and I said the expense was too great for me he said Call upon me in the morning and I will put you into a good thing I think I slept there that night - I went with him the next morning to the Mitre public-house in Chancery-lane I there saw Isaacs whom I had not seen for twelve months before - Burrowes spoke to him and they appeared to be friendly For the next week or two I lived at the New Inn and paid for my own lodging and provision during that time I saw both the prisoners frequently and a few days after I asked Isaacs what situation Burrowes was going to put me into he replied He be d - d why does he not behave honourable towards me - he did not say in what respect he was to behave honourable to him and he said So help him God he would split which means to tell he said I know I have marks which I have kept in my possession which will do for Jack Burrowes I afterwards saw Burrowes and told him of this he replied I don t mind what such a fellow as that says I don t heed him a pin and said he would call and see him I told Isaacs Burrowes would call and see him - I went with Burrowes to Isaacs they quarrelled and Isaacs said he would hang him and when Burrowes left the room I said For God s sake do not do that - they quarrelled about some money Isaacs wanted some money from Burrowes Isaacs showed me some bills of parcels and a receipt for 103l which was the amount of the invoices Isaacs asked if I knew Burrowes had lived at Bath I said I had heard so he said he had done the trick up nicely there that he Isaacs had received parcels of goods up in town here from him and that he had gone once to Bath and brought up 103l worth of goods from him and the invoices he had shown me were for those goods - I asked him what Burrows was there he said he lived in Bond-street Bath but did not tell me with whom I asked how Burrowes managed to get the goods away he said he had stopped at a public-house close by and used to meet Burrowes three or four times a day that Burrowes used to bring the goods out sometimes concealed in his trousers waistcoat and hat and he received them from him - I asked how Burrowes managed to get the goods down he said he used to go up into the warehouse in the morning when nobody was there and conceal them Q This related to the 103l worth of goods A Yes and he said he had received other goods in town from him he said he kept the greater part of the goods from Burrowes but had sold some to Mr Olding in Chancery-lane I told him I had seen two bills in Burrowes possession drawn by him he said those were the two bills he had sold goods for and if Burrowes would give him up one of those bills he would be satisfied I told Burrowes all that Isaacs had said and he said he should give him no more Isaacs afterwards showed me one of these bills and said Burrowes had given it to him - it was for 14l I bought a small quantity of lace goods of Burrowes myself at the New Inn and changed them for poplin I saw him offer some shawls and half-handkerchiefs to Mrs Browning and some customers in her private parlour he was offering a shawl to Mrs Browning for 24s and she said it was no better than what she gave him 26s for - I think that was what she said but one was better than another - I cannot tell which Burrowes on the same day took out a parcel which I believe was shawls we walked to Holborn-hill and he said he was going to Mr New or Bew at Pimlico to offer them for sale I did not go with him I frequently conversed with Isaacs about Burrowes and told Burrowes what he said Isaacs afterwards told me Mr Olding would not pay the bills I asked why - he said Olding understands the goods were stolen I asked how Olding knew that he said Mrs Barrett his landlady had told him some time after this Isaacs told me the bills would not be paid and if Burrowes would consent to give up his bill he Isaacs would give up his upon receiving 7l which Olding had sold and would give up the rest of the goods Burrowes did not like to go to Olding and asked me to go I went and took Burrowes bill with me which was for 13l odd I presented the bill Olding said I thought the thing had been quietly arranged I said I know nothing about that - he said I have been waiting at home all the morning and I shall now go down to Bath I went and told Isaacs what passed - he replied To be sure it was so understood - the bills were to be returned and the goods taken back I went with Isaacs and Mr Walker to Olding s house and the goods were divided there Burrowes had told me to take all the Bandanna and black handkerchiefs which I did and brought away 3l 5s in money - that was for Burrowes - Isaacs had some pink ladies handkerchiefs some turbanand crimson handkerchiefs about ten large black handkerchiefs and some Canary handkerchiefs and 3l 5s - Olding desired to have something for his trouble and Isaacs gave him 5s - a few days after that I got some goods from Brocock and Co - I took them to the New Inn and offered them to Mrs Browning for sale Burrowes came there but did not offer any thing for sale at that time Burrowes afterwards left the New Inn and went to lodge at No 10 Mary Ann-place Clifford-street over the water I went in the coach with him I saw him go into the house but was never there myself I have called there by his desire and left messages for him he called it his lodging - I saw a young man there who had frequently been in his company before I used after that to see Burrowes at the Olive Branch public-house and at a public-house at the corner of Mitre-street at the Prince of Wales public-house and sometimes at a billiard-table in Waterloo-road we were very familiar together I asked him once what situation he would put me into he said if I would work his oracle he would employ me I had told Burrowes what Isaacs had said about Bath and the second time I mentioned it he acknowledged it and said he had robbed his different employers and that to the amount of hundreds he said he had robbed the prosecutor I have heard him say that in Isaacs presence and in his absence they quarrelled once at the Olive Branch when there were four people in the house and he acknowledged it there he said Oh Yes you need not tell me of it I have had such a fellow as you to deal with - you have robbed me Isaacs said he had been subservient to him long enough and said You have robbed your employers and made me accessary to it and now left me without money and without shoes to my feet they came out and Isaacs said he would tell - Burrowes said Do do I would as soon die on a gallows as not since I have got acquainted with such a fellow as you Isaacs told him he had marks which come upon the goods that were quite enough to do for him Burrowes replied I have enough to do for you where is the pocket-book you robbed the man of in Waterloo-road I at last wrote a letter to Mr Rose at Bath as I was not comfortable in my mind for one thing and another on the day I wrote I was with the prisoners at the Prince of Wales we walked together to the Elephant public-house I did not hear what they said but Isaacs said to me just after Burrowes has offered to give me a suit of clothes if I will contradict what I have said to Mr Browning he had told him Burrowes had robbed his employer at Bath and sent the goods up to him and that when he went to Bath he brought the goods away and Burrowes told Isaacs to take his name and write down to Mr Rose for a character - he would give him one which would get him a situation I said to Isaacs You shall not contradict what you have stated for I have stated the same thing and won t be made a liar for you I said I would write to Mr Rose and inform him of it and I did so and made a communication to Mr Caldecott I was taken into custody and have been locked up ever since Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you know what Burrowes had stated to Mr Browning Yes I was present at the latter part of it and I myself had told Mr Browning - I came forward to-day for the sake of public justice and to case my own mind which was distressed - that is my chief reason my name is Samuel Horatio Nelson Withers Q In whose employ were you last A I will not tell you gentlemen do not like their names mentioned - I have lived with Messrs Young at Nottingham and before that with one Ridgway who I believe is now in Whitecross-street I do not know where he lived while I was with him - I left because he could not continue his business he never accused me of robbing him of furs Burrowes said Mr Ridgway says you have taken furs - I said it was by his knowledge he had two young men - he could not pay us and told us to take the furs for our salary a man once met me in Holborn and accused me of robbing my employer Mr Brooks but there was no foundation for it - I went to the office and to the House of Correction for a few days and the person who sent me there bought the goods of Burrowes Q Did any thing particular happen at the masquerade A Nothing particular that I know of Burrows lost his watch there - he was mad drunk he pulled off his clothes and threw his watch into the room I took it up but did not recollect that I had it till we got to the Finish I have had letters directed to me in the name of Smart my mother s maiden name it was by my desire - I never went by any other name I know nothing of the name of Hyman Q Did you ever state that you changed your name to Hyman for fear of being transported A Never I declare I lived at Manchester with Mr Watts of Deansgate - I never lived with a person named Smart I have been examined in a Court of Justice Q Was it not on a trial in which your brother prosecuted Colonel Arch for an unnatural crime A I shall not answer that COURT You must answer it - it is not an improper question Witness I was examined on that trial as a witness for my brother Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did not Isaacs tell you his mother s name was Adlam but he was a natural son of Isaacs and sometimes look both names A He said his father s name was Isaacs and his father s Adlam I have seen her and called her Isaacs - I was told her name was Adlam I bought some goods of Brocock and Co of Cheapside in January - I bought about 5l worth of goods - I took them for a bad debt they owed me the money I summoned them and took it in lace I swear it was for a bad debt for expences I had incurred in looking after a person for them Q Before you met Burrowes how had you been living A I lived in a situation at Mr Scott s last - I was going about with the prisoners only a few days I travelled for myself about a month I left Mr Brooks in consequence of not making a cloak properly - there was a charge made against me there about stealing 2 lbs of mutton chops from his butchers and he took me to the office he never charged me with any thing else to my knowledge - he never did charge me with any other robbery COURT Q Was the charge made by Mr Brooks or the butcher A They did not come forward - the chops were paid for I was charged also with taking a rabbit from a poulterer s and some eggs - I do not recollect any thing else - he never accused me of stealing any thing from his house Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q How do you recollect the date on which you met Burrowes A Because it was the day after Christmas-day - I do not know whether Oliver is here or any other persons I have mentioned our conversation at the New Inn was not in Browning s presence I heard Olding had been threatened to be sued for the bill - the attorney and Adlam were present at the settlement I remember going one night to Browning s in liquor I said Burrowes was locked up and I believed Aldam had given him in charge for felony - he had threatened to do so often I did not say if he gave me some money I would get him discharged he asked what would get him out - I said I supposed 7s or 8s - he offered it to me I refused to take it and he sent the waiter the wife offered me the money - I did not say it was for breaking windows I was in liquor and do not recollect what I said - I said he was confined for felony or an assault MR ADOLPHUS Q You have mentioned several circumstances which show a dishonest life on your own part - were not the prisoners acquainted with all this A Yes they knew it all I was charged with having the chops and things months after I left Mr Brooks ANDREW CALDECOTT I am a Manchester warehouseman and live in Mitre-court Cheapside I know Mr Rose of Bond-street Bath Withers called on me on Saturday week and gave me some information I wrote to Mr Rose by the same night s post and gave information at the Police-office the prisoners were taken I believe - Withers was taken but I left the case entirely in Mr Cope s hands MR WILLIAM WADHAM COPE I am one of the marshals of London In consequence of information I sent Brown in search of Burrowes and I went in search of Isaacs on Saturday week Withers went with me to Chancery-lane to the Mitre public-house I think it is - Withers called Isaacs into the passage I made him no threat or promise but I told him I understood he had some property he had received from Burrowes he said he had and he would show it me - he took me up stairs and produced these twelve pieces of handkerchiefs which he said he had from Burrowes who had stolen them from Mr Rose of Bath he then opened a pocket-book in which I saw some memorandums and these four small tickets which he said were taken off some net-lace which was stolen from Mr Rose I came down stairs with him and asked Withers in his hearing if he thought I had got all the property - Withers replied he thought I had We were then coming away and Withers asked Isaacs if he had told me all the circumstances - he said he had not Withers then said Have you told him about your going to Bath and bringing away in one week 103l worth of property of Mr Rose s Isaacs replied he had not told me that and then said that he went to Bath one Saturday evening and returned on the Sunday week following with a box containing goods of Mr Rose s to the amount of 103l and that he had been in the habit of receiving a great many parcels from Burrowes containing Mr Rowe s property I told him he must come with me to the Mansion-house I went and mentioned the circumstances to the Lord Mayor who directed me to take the two prisoners and Withers to the Compter Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did he when he showed you these things say that he knew at the time that they were stolen A Yes and that he went down to Bath and brought away 103l worth of goods in one week JOHN BROWN I am an officer of the City I went on Saturday to search for Burrowes at several places round the Waterloo-road I found him in a street just by the Surrey Theatre - I took him into the Prince of Wales public-house and told him I had him in custody for robbing his master at Bath of some property he said I am willing to go with you I took a coach and brought him to the Mansion-house - when I told him I had him in custody he said I suppose I shall go to Somersetshire - I told him to ask me no questions as it was not my duty to give him answers When we were in the coach he said if he asked me a question would I give him an answer I said I begged he would not as I certainly would not answer - I left him at the Mansion-house and went with Mr Cope to Isaacs he acknowledged before me that he had received 103l worth of goods from Burrowes at Bath I did not see him deliver the handkerchiefs I went over to Clifford-street next day to Burrowes lodging which Withers had pointed out I there found a shawl a piece of black silk some papers and four duplicates I then went to the Prince of Wales and got this parcel containing other goods claimed by the prosecutor I went to the New Inn with Mr Cope - she produced a gown-piece or something but would not deliver it up I again went to the New Inn and opened a bureau with some keys which I took from Burrowes I there found a duplicate two pocket-books a quantity of letters and a diamond pin Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q All you know about Burrowes lodging in Clifford-street is from Withers A No - the landlord told me so and showed me the room MR COPE I am certain Isaacs mentioned about receiving goods from Burrowes at Bath Brown was not present at that time I think as I was up stairs with Isaacs I found in Burrowes pocket-books two invoices - one amounts to 45l 7s 8 1/2d and the other to 58l 10s and this receipt which is for 103l 17s 8d Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q What did you go up stairs with Isaacs for A He said he had some handkerchiefs in his desk up stairs When we came down I resumed the conversation Brown was present then he was not present all the time - I think he heard about going to Bath MR ROSE re-examined I have no doubt that these invoices are in Burrowes s hand writing - they are written on exactly the description of paper I use the receipt for 103l is in Burrowes s writing Burrowes was not out of my service for two days while in my service - the tickets produced are all my writing and were affixed to my goods - I have not been at home since the goods were found to examine if I miss them - they are such goods as I have in my stock these pink handkerchiefs are rather damaged with folding and I bought them under price in consequence of that here is fifty-two yards of bobbin net mentioned in one of the invoices and here is the ticket which was on an article of that description MR PHILLIPS Q It is not impossible to make a mistake about the goods A It is possible I saw two pairs of silk hose at the Mansion-house with marks on them which I am certain were such as I use but I couldnot swear to the writing as it was not mine - these tickets are my own writing Burrowes was rather more than three months with me - I think he came just after we had taken stock - I may have come to London for three days while he was with me but I cannot recollect if Burrows had been absent I should have heard of it Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Your s is a large concern A Yes - I have a stock worth 12 000l or 14 000l I took stock in August - it was at first intended to have the prisoner tried in Somersetshire I could not swear to a loss unless it was to a very great extent - I have seven shopmen and three apprentices - Burrowes occasionally carried goods out to ladies he might go out at the private door twenty times a day and not be noticed - I have lace occasionally sent me on sale or return from Nottingham but I never mark them - I have been in business five or six years and may occasionally send out goods with the private markon them if I had seen these goods in another shop I should not have had any suspicion - I never heard of Burrowes being in business - I gave him warning for being out after eleven o clock at night - I have been to a Mr Stokes where I had bought some poplin MR ADOLPHUS Q Is your private mark a word or sentence A A sentence When I saw the stockings I said the letters were the same as my marks but were not my writing but these tickets are my own writing - if I was in town it must have been on the 2d of November - I was not in town on the 10th of October - I was at home then I am certain - the prisoner could not have come to town in October without my knowledge The invoices were here referred to one was dated London 1st July 1827 - Henry Adlam bought of John Burrowes the amount 47l 7s 8 1/2d the other London 33 Basinghall-street July 17 1827 Henry Adlam bought of John Burrowes amount 58l 10s The receipt was - Received 1st of October 1827 of Mr H Adlam 103l 17s 8d for goods as per bills John Burrowes WILLIAM FRANCELLON I am warehouseman to Messrs Roger and Co of Watling-street - Mr Rose deals with them - last July I sold him forty-one dozen and five silk handkerchiefs I believe these pink ones to be some of them - they are faded in the fold here are some others like them which we have left - they are the same in quality colour and damage they were sold under the regular price Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Have you not sold such articles to other people A No doubt of it MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you ever sell any to Burrowes A No - BONES My father keeps the Prince of Wales Waterloo-road Burrowes frequented our house he left a brown paper parcel of goods with me I gave it to Brown the officer - these are them he told me to keep them till he returned for them - this was two days before Brown came GEORGE OLDING being called on his recognizance did not appear BURROWES Defence Previous to my being employed by Mr Rose I was in the habit of buying and selling goods sometimes on credit and if I had an invoice I destroyed it and made a fresh one - they were generally five or ten per cent lower than the regular way Mr Rose s private mark is A Discovery and many people use that mark - I myself use it and can prove that the stockings produced at the Mansion-house were bought for cash I got embarrassed left off this jobbing and took a situation I had 120l worth of goods in my possession when I went into Mr Rose s service and knowing Isaacs when in business at Kingston I gave him the goods to sell and a list of persons I did business with I was to allow him five per cent to sell them for me but having goods of his own he could not attend to mine and sold none except to Olding Isaacs came to Bath to know if he might let him have goods I said he might and take off ten per cent for bills both the bills were dishonoured and I put it into my Solicitor s hands but afterwards took my goods back I then came from Bath Isaacs asked me to lend him 10l - I lent him a bill of 16l on Olding I told Isaacs to sell the goods for money and the person will appear who I bought them of When I was a town traveller in the lace trade I knew Withers - he lived with Mr Scott in Ratcliff-highway I recommended him to a Mr Ridgway and before the shop was opened he and another young man took the whole stock of furs to Rotherham s sold them and then started - this was the first I knew of him I did not see him again till the day after Christmas when I met him in Sidney s-alley he said he was in the lace trade I said if he had anything cheap I would buy it he said he wanted a situation but he had 200l or 300l in his pocket which he spent very freely - he got me into a kind of labyrinth and we were spending our money together The tickets for the masquerade were given us and while there I was in liquor - he took my gold watch from me and kept it I asked him for it at the New Inn and he deliberately stated that he knew nothing of it but by Browning speaking to him watch in possession of a woman of the town I found Isaacs was not in the lace trade and on that account I cut him and he then entered into a league with this person I shall prove he said if it cost him his life he would do for me ISAACS Defence I received the goods from Burrowes but whether they were stolen or not I do not know As to Brown he was as near to me as Mr Cope was CHARLES BROOKS I am a linen-draper and live at No 180 Oxford-street I know Withers and would not believe him on his oath MR ADOLPHUS Q Do you know Burrowes A Yes he lived with Mr Hopwood my neighbour he has formerly sold me goods but not since November HENRY KNOWLES I am in no particular business I have an agent in France I live in West-square Lambeth - I send goods abroad I know Burrowes and have had dealings with him since the beginning of last year - he was then buying goods in the linen-drapery line or anything he could get cheap he bought of me shawls and lace of different kinds and silk shawls of a variety of colours looking at a book here is an entry of the 12th of February 1827 it is a job lot of 10l 8s of different sorts of shawls - they were all shawls here are some veils and lace in September last to the amount of about 16l here is 6th July 6 pieces of Badanna 13l 10s and 20th August 16l but I have not got the particulars of that here is an entry September 10th 1827 6 veils and 6 lace collars 5l 10s I served him with the goods and the entries are in my hand-writing the transactions were personal - I knew he was a jobber MR ADOLPHUS Q This book you say is in your hand-writing A Yes it was all written at the times it is dated I keep no other book - my agent s name is William Brewer of Ghent he keeps the English exchange-office - I lived in Kennington-lane before I came to West-square when I dealt with the prisoner I lived at the Horns public-house in Gutter-lane I was not then resident in London - I believe the prisoner then lived at No 33 Basinghall-street - I believe he had a counting-house or room there Q Did you deliver these goods there A He generally came to me I cannot say whether he came home in July this entry of September is in pencil - the regular books I have are not in town Q Now will you swear you saw him in town in September A Yes I sold him these goods and delivered them personally in town they might be sent to him - they were sent to him on the 10th of September here in London Q If you did not deliver them to him personally in London where did you deliver them A I sent them to him where he was staying in Nichols-square - I did not see him there - he called on me not more than three or four days before the parcel was delivered he called on me at a house in Newgate-market where I was to meet him it was at a private house a coffee-house in Ivy-lane kept by Franklin on the right-hand going to Newgate-street I saw him there three or four days before the 10th of September and he gave me this order - I am now living at No 8 West-square and keep the house I cannot swear these are any of the goods I sold him - there are hundreds and thousands like these MR BODKIN Q Had you any dealing with Burrowes for goods of this kind in 1826 A Yes MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you ever go by the name of McQuire A No nor any name but Knowles JAMES BENNETT I am a linen-draper and live in Fleet-market my brother sold Burrowes six pair of half silk hose a short time ago - he sold three pair the money was returned and other goods taken - I believe Mr Rose came to me about them and said he supposed they might be his but I compared the three pair with others and said I believed they had been bought of me MR ADOLPHUS Q It appeared that the prosecutor s shop mark corresponded with yours A Yes he was satisfied and it went no further - WARNER I am in the employ of a lace house in Lad-lane I have sold Burrowes linen-drapery and haberdashery and have bought lace of him - I have known him three years I have sold Knowles goods perhaps to the amount of 200l MR ADOLPHUS Q When did you sell Burrowes any thing A Not within the last twelve months - I think he then lived in Maiden-lane THOMAS BROWNING I keep the New Inn Old Bailey I have known Burrowes about two years he lodged at my house now and then - Isaacs came there two or three times - I knew Withers he came once or twice and stopped a night now and then Q Has ever any conversation passed in your presence between Burrowes Isaacs and Withers respecting a robbery at Bath A Never he never admitted robbing his master at Bath in my presence - I heard of Burrowes going to a masquerade and I heard Withers say he could tell him where his watch was and he told me so - Burrowes was complaining of its being taken from him - Withers came to my house about a fornight ago or more he said Burrowes was in confinement for breaking glass and if I would give him 7s 6d he could release him - I had not a good opinion enough of him to give it him - I did not offer it to him Mr Rose came to my house and said he was robbed and looked at some goods which had been bought of Burrowes - the poplin was not bought of him there was a shawl I do not know whether he claimed that Burrowes maintained an honest and respectable character MR ADOLPHUS Q When did he go to Bath A About six weeks ago I did not see him again till November he sent no parcel to my house during all that time there was a little child s cloak nothing else nobody came to my house for parcels sent by him not to my knowledge - he was there some weeks in November and has offered shawls for sale - I never saw lace - there was handkerchiefs - I am not able to say where he lived I have heard people speak well of him at Woolwich where his parents live and in London MR BODKIN Q Did you give him a fair price for the shawl A Yes Mr Rose said so -

I placed it there again and told Mr Kirk who came and looked at it I live in the house I was on the watch about six o clock when the men left work and saw the prisoner come into the back warehouse to brush his clothes two other men did the same - the two men went with me and shut up the warehouse - I then told them they might go I did not see the prisoner again till he came down to go out - Mr Kirk said he wanted him - I told him so and he said What does he want with me I saw him a few minutes ago I said Perhaps he wants you to go to the dyers Mr Kirk came down and said What is that you have in your basket he said Nothing at all then said Mr Kirk You must have something about your person he said he had nothing at all I told Mr Kirk he had better search him if he had any doubt Mr Kirk put his hand on his right-hand coat pocket and asked what was there I cannot exactly say what answer he gave but Mr Kirk pulled out some cochineal and sent Field for some clean paper to put it on - 9 ozs were found I went with him and the constable and saw 2 ozs more found in the same pocket - he said the devil tempted him to do it and it was the first act he had done Cross-examined Q Did you tell the Magistrate that he said so A I do not know I answered what questions were put to me I do not think I did mention it - I have heard Field state it here and I also heard the prisoner say it - my master serve dyers with goods I never myself knew the prisoner to be in Mr Russel Kirk s employ his coat hung in the room where the cochineal was found there were books in the kitchen on purpose for the coats but he hung his in that place - he was asked what he meant to do with the cochineal and would not give an answer I never heard him say he did not know it was in his pocket JOSIAH EVANS I am a constable and was sent for 9 ozs of cochineal were given to me which they said were found on the prisoner I searched him afterwards and found 2 ozs more in his coat pocket he did not say it had been placed there by anybody else Cross-examined Q You heard nothing about the devil did you A I cannot recollect it but will not say he never said so Prisoner s Defence When I went to the warehouse I drove a nail for my hat and coat and always hung it on that nail I do not know who put the cochineal into my pocket GUILTY Aged 45 Transported for Seven Years

this cask of pork was in an under-ground warehouse I have a crane to raise goods from there On the 24th of March about half-past two o clock I went on Change as usual I returned about half-past five and received information - Fell knew my hours of being on Change I went to Rowley s shop directly and saw him - I said Mr Rowley have you been receiving a cask of provision from my warehousemen he said he had I said How came you to take in a cask from my warehouseman - he said I took this cask from John Fell your warehouseman because he said it was made a present to him I said It is a curious way are you in the habit of receiving casks from my warehouseman he said I don t know I said he should have asked me if I had made such a present - I think he added that I did not want the cask he said Here is the cask will you have it or will you take it away I said Oh no Mr Rowley it is perfectly safe here let it stand I went home and in the course of the evening it was brought back to my warehouse - I had not ordered it to be sent I had my stock taken and found a very large deficiency - I immediately ordered Fell to quit my premises in five minutes he kept out of the way for about a fortnight - I went and sent for him but could not find him he was advertised by the parish and taken - I know the cask to be mine by the carrier s brand-mark on it it was one of one hundred barrels imported from Limerick Fell had no authority to sell my goods DAVIS BROWN I am in the prosecutor s employ On the 24th of March a little after three o clock in the afternoon I saw Fell rolling a barrel of pork from our cellar towards Wapping-dock I lost sight of him at near the gun-dock - he was going towards Rowley s I went home and reported what I had seen - I went after him again and saw him pitch it into Mr Rowley s shop there was a young man at the further end of the shop - I saw Fell talking to him I then came away and told master when he came home - I afterwards saw the cask and believe it to be the same - it was full Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How near were you to the cask at any time A Within four or five yards I did not particularly examine it - I did not see him take it from the cellar I knew it by the brandmark COURT Q Did you go to the warehouse to see if any casks were missing A Yes and missed it - I had stowed it away a day or two before myself and had seen it there that very day about half-past six o clock - this one stood in front of the others JOHN McNAMARA I am cooper to the prosecutors - On the 24th of March about half-past three o clock Fell asked me to go down into the cellar to help him roll out a barrel of pork - we do not always use the crane master was not at home - Fell first asked me where Storey the clerk was I said at the public-house he then said Come down and help me with a barrel of pork out of the cellar it is a good time I helped him - he then asked me to roll it for him to Rowley s shop - I would not and then he said he was the best man himself to roll it and accordingly he did he said D - n your eyes you are as bad as I am I had some suspicion that all was not right - I went over to Brown and told him what had happened I did not see where he took it to - the brandmark on it was Reading Limerick I did not see him take it more than twenty or thirty yards it came back the same evening - I am sure it was the same cask I can swear to it he said I was as bad as he was and liable to be transported - it was taken from a pile of about one hundred others Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Then it was not standing by itself A No it was in the pile - my master allows me a piece of pork when I want it Q Were you ever fined 40s for stealing pork A Yes but Fell the foreman gave it to me he and I were together - it was eighteen months ago I did not tell master of this till I was taken to the Police-office - I was never taken up before - I had no quarrel with Fell COURT Q Was Fell fined at the time you were A No - he went away we were only going through the docks to give a bit of pork to the foreman of the winedepartment for some wine I never told master that Fell was concerned MR BRODRICK to ROBERT LINKLATER Q Do not you know that it was Rowley who sent the cask home A I do not know he came to me that evening after it had come and told me he had sent it home he went over the way then - I made no charge against him at that time he continued in his business Fell was taken about a month ago and the Magistrate issued a summons for Rowley by my desire - there were three hearings I do not think there were more - Rowley did not attend at one of them he attended once as a witness - I went to the office one evening in consequence of a notice but he did not come and nothing was done as Mr Humphries my solicitor ordered me not to do anything unless he was there Rowley was there that night and attended two or three times after Q Did you apply to an attorney named Dodd A No I know him very well he did not act as my attorney I was never in Mr Harmer s office in my life - I do not know where it is I did not send Dodd to Rowley s at any time I know he went there - that might be a week after the discovery - it was before any examination Q Is not Dodd now acting as your attorney A No Mr Humphries is my attorney - Dodd did not attend before the Magistrate as my attorney he may have been there he told me afterwards that he had been to Rowley and I approved of what he said but I did not apply to him - when Rowley came to me nothing passed about anything but the cask I took hold of the chain of the crane and said The cask could not be taken out without this no other conversation passed to the best of my knowledge Q Did you not in the first instance forget that Rowley had called on you A Yes I had entirely forgotten it but I recollected it when he mentioned it I do not recollect any other conversation passing MR CLARKSON Are you sure no conversation passed respecting his dealing with Fell for two or three years A Not a sentence I attended all the examinations COURT Q What did you understand by Rowley saying you did not want it A I understood him to mean that Fell had received it as a present from some other person and I did not want to purchase it - that was the impression on my mind I said it was curious to take casks from my foreman without coming to me as I did not live three hundred yards off - he did not say what he gave for it - Dodd told me he had information that Rowley had sent money to Fell and ordered him to keep out of the way while I was looking for him Q Is that what you approved of A Why I thought I could not convict him without having Fell and I thought it was necessary for me to have information whether he was out of the way and Dodd said he would call to know that I approved of his calling as it saved me trouble he said he would call and ask Rowley that I think he called afterwards and told me he had been to Rowley I did not authorize Dodd to go to Rowley and say he should be prosecuted unless he paid 1000l on my oath I never did nor did Dodd tell me he had made such a communication Rowley did not say Fell had told him he had the cask from the master of a vessel JAMES DODDS I am occasionally employed as attorney for the prosecutor but on this prosecution I never was employed profssionally by him I am subpoenaed here for the prisoners I called on Rowley three times I did not communicate with the prosecutor before I called - the first time was a fortnight or three weeks after the 24th of March I saw Rowley in his counting-house and told him I understood he knew where Fell Mr Linklater s late foreman was as it was reported he had given him money to go out of town he denied it and asked if Linklater intended to prosecute Fell I said I believed he did but he was away - he then asked if he intended to prosecute him I said I did not know that I had no instruction to call on him but I had merely called to get this question answered and to see some receipts which he had the prosecutor s son is articled to me I am continually calling on him Rowley asked me if Fell could turn King s evidence against him I told him he could - he said he did not care for that as he had plenty of receipts for some empty casks which he had received and he pulled one from a file - it was for empty casks and signed John Fell he then asked me how much property was lost from Linklater s premises I said the books were at an accountants in the City and I believed 2 000l worth of provisons were said to be lost from the stock he said he had not had above 100l worth nor so much and asked me what would settle the affair I told him I had no authority to call on him and advised him to go to his friends consult some professional man and get the best advice he could I afterwards saw Linklater and said I do not know whether I have done right - but I have been to Rowley s to get information about Fell and look at some receips I called on Rowley again - he appeared much dejected said he had been speaking to his friends and asked me if the thing could he settled I said No he could not buy Mr Linklater I was sure - he said If I was to send a friend of mine who is a friend of Linklater s would it nothave great weight I said it might but I had nothing to do with it I called as a friend I called again and there were two persons in the shop one was a lad and the other an elderly person whose name I understood to be Mitchell Rowley then said he had been into the country but had not found any friend who he could call one who would go to Mr Linklater on the business and here the conversation ended we were shut in the counting-house the two persons were not present when we came out into the shop Rowley said I cannot find 1 000l I said I do not know what you mean for I supposed he was going to make some evidence of my being there I had said nothing about 1 000l I said in these peoples presence that I had no authority from Mr Linklater for calling and in point of fact I was blamed by him for going there MR LAW Q How long have you been a professional man A Nine years I was not a friend of Rowley s - I saw Linklater the evening I had the first conversation and told him about the receipts I did not think there was any occasion to tell him more Q Why did you conceal any part of the conversation A Rowley being a neighbour of Linklater s I did not wish to irritate Linklater s feelings the second interview was four or five days afterwards - I called to do everything in my power to avoid a prosecution as Rowley had friends in the neighbourhood I thought the best way would be to send an intimate friend of his to Linklater to prevent a prosecution Q On your oath did you not yourself mention the 1000l A Yes Rowley asked what would settle it I said I could not enter into it - he asked if 100l or 200l would settle it I said No nor 1000l either I mentioned one or two of these circumstances to Linklater and he blamed me for going as I had no authority I did not mention the 1000l to him - my object was to settle it without a compromise Q On your solemn oath did you not say in the presence of the two persons in the shop that it was Mr Linklater s wish that Rowley should deposit 1000l till his books were examined A No nor did I say Rowley was to make up what was deficient nor anything to that effect Q Did not Rowley say If you have any proposition to make you had better put it into writing and then he could consult his friends A I do not remember it I assure you if it did pass it must have occurred in the hurry when he called me as I was going out and said I cannot find 1000l - I swear I never heard it Q And did you not say you should commit yourself as a professional man by doing it A No I went to Mr Harmer to appoint a time for Linklater to come to him I had told Linklater I should go to Mr Harmer s and he assented to it I went and Mr Harmer told me he was engaged in the case and next day I went with Linklater to Mr Humphries - I did not attend at the office I never told Linklater what had passed between me and Rowley respecting making up the books and the 1000l - I do not think I did but really I cannot charge my memory Q Then when you went to Mr Harmer you had no desire to settle it A No the truth is Rowley s character had been pretty well blown about the neighbourhood and it was known on Change and if Linklater had not prosecuted he would have suffered in his character himself MR ADOLPHUS Q You were subpoenaed on the prisoner s behalf A Yes I called the second and third time at Rowley s request he said nothing more to me about money than I have stated FELL s Defence I never did anything but what the clerk directed as to master s loss I cannot be accountable - I understand they have found 800l worth since I have been confined I was not out of the way at all - the clerk is the guilty man he cannot be found McNamara told me Dodd had him into the parlour and gave him two glasses of wine to get all he could out of him ROWLEY s Defence Dodd came three times to me to make a compromise and if I would do that they would forbear the prosecution I said I was innocent and would not give 1d he might do his worst I asked him to put it down in writing - he said as a professional man he should be committing himself MR LINKLATER I do not know where my clerk is now - he has been with two accountants but has been unwell I suppose he is at home - he left word that he was not well I have not sent for him since I have dismissed him there is a delinquency but I have not proof to bring it forward Fell was advertised for leaving his wife and child JOHN McNAMARA re-examined Dodd never gave me any wine COURT Q He said you were as liable to be transported as he was A Yes - that was when I refused to help him to Rowley s with it CHARLES ADAMS I am shopman to Mr Rowley and have been so this twelve months he has been in his shop till this morning and has surrendered I remember Dodd coming to him three times -

I took them out and marked them separately Garnell was concealed to watch that day and in consequence of what he said I went in pursuit of the prisoner as he went to dinner and overtook him in the Haymarket and brought him back I wished him to take what property he had of Mr Colwell s out of his pocket he said he had no property of Mr Colwell s I said Take out what you have got and the first thing he took out was the parcel of knives and forks which were the same I had marked in the oven he said he had brought them to our place to clean from his lodgings we have a great number of the same pattern in the wash-house - it is a very old pattern Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q There have of course been a cunsiderable quantity sold A That pattern has been kept many years but the forks are of a particular sort - they had no mark before I found them behind the oven - I believe the name was burned into the knives but I cannot say I put a mark similar to the figure 5 turned upside down and five forks I marked with a figure 7 the knives appeared to have been dipped in blood and of course were dirty - they appeared new Mr Colwell had bought some of that pattern within three months from Bryan a town maker the prisoner said they were his own MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you miss any parcel of knives and forks A No I saw the prisoner come in the morning - he brought no parcel with him there is a convenience for cleanin them near the oven MR PHILLIPS Q Might he not easily have brought them in his pocket A He might they were not dirty except from the blood JAMES GARNELL On the 21st of August I was concealed under a trap-door and could command a view of the old oven very plainly I saw the prisoner go and wash his hands and face he pulled out his watch then went to the oven opened the door and pulled out a parcel which he put into his pocket I had seen the parcel in the oven the night before when I was concealed and knew they were knives -

Dodd and another shopman were in the shop then MR EDWARD COLWELL I live in the Haymarket - The prisoner has been my porter for nearly four years In consequence of what I heard I went with an officer to search his lodgings and found a great quantity of property which I knew to be mine tea-pots tea-trays knives and forks and several articles - none of them had been marked by me but had our private marks on them I never gave him permission to take anything from my stock - the knives found on him are not an old pattern - the forks are they do not match the knives I have had forks of that pattern in my stock about twenty years and had ceased to sell them being quite out fashion Cross-examined Q Did you ever sell them yourself A No they were my father s stock I never sold any of the articles found to the prisoner - I have sold such things with the same marks to other persons there is no article I can identify except by the private mark JOHN UPSON I am an officer I was sent for to Mr Colwell s on the 21st of August and took the prisoner I produce the knives and forks which I found on the counter -

here is the tea-pot with the mark erased I think there seems a smear - this milk-pot I can speak to decidedly also the tea-tray and waiter to match it my private-mark is on several of them I have no mark on Chubb s lock but the number stamped on it is the number I had from him - here are several articles with my private-mark and several tools have the marks erased and that very lately here are seven knives and forks which are used at my own table at times and which I could not have sold - I had not missed them Cross-examined Q Suppose you had seen these forks eight or ten miles off could you say they had not been sold A No certainly but they are two patterns and I happened to have the same pattern of each of them WILLIAM DODD Here is a figure of 7 on one of these forks - I did it with a tool this is the only one I can find the mark on - here is the 5 upside down on all the knives - I marked them the morning before Cross-examined Q Have not these knives been much used A They have been on a board they may have been used - the edge of one is hacked I doubt their having been used MR ADOLPHUS Q Look at the other three knives do they appear quite new A I have no doubt about it Prisoner s Defence Those five knives and forks I bought five years ago at an auction in London-road - the others I bought at the corner of Noel-street the ten and milk-pot I bought of a man named Nixon three years ago - he was in Mr Colwell s employ as to the other things some were bought of Mr Colwell and some were not -

I never knew what is was MR PHILLIPS Q Look at the bottom is there anything that you would call a mark of recent sand-paper having rubbed anything out A I do not myself but I do not understand it COURT Q Do you remember whether Dixon and Son was on the back of it A I do not - it was in my possession a day and a night I have seen it repeatedly since and drank tea out of it MR PHILLIPS Q There is a milk-pot it is rather a remarkable shape A Yes - it is the same as I had I borrowed it at the same time I am confident it is the same MR ADOLPHUS Q How long is it since you first became acquainted with the milk-pot A Two years at Christmas I have known them in the prisoner s possession three years - I do not know whether he was then in Mr Colwell s employ I washed the tea-pot when I borrowed it - I did not observe any mark on it particularly MARY GRAY My husband is a gentleman s servant - we live in Rupert-street I have known the prisoner two years - I have known that tea-board in the prisoner s possession for two years - I lodged in the next room to him and saw it there continually MR ADOLPHUS Q Has he lived in the same lodging two years A No - he had it when he first lodged at our house he remained there till within about eleven months - I have seen the tea-pot but not to notice it much he was in Mr Colwell s service when I first knew him MR COLWELL My shop-mark is on the milk-pot I think it could not have been in use two years and the mark appear as it does though I think it has been in his possession some time from the mark - my mark is on the tea-board MR BODKIN Q Have you a word which you use as a private-mark A Yes the tea-board is marked with characters by myself COURT Q Is your privatemark on all your goods A On all we can mark it is the marks on the tools that have been erased with sand-paper -

I accused him of taking the things which I missed and he strongly denied it I asked how he got the wasitcoat and trousers - he said his mother took them out of pawn for him I then went to the other prisoner s house who is his mother and there saw my carpeting lying down in the place but she was not at home - I knew the carpeting to be mine there were about four yards and three-quarters in one piece and two yards and a half in another - they were different patterns one was cut from a piece and the other the breadth from a whole carpet the breadth had been cut in two and joined so as to make a square piece - I came home and said to John How could you send me to your mother s for I have found my property there he said if I would forgive him he would tell me the truth what he had robbed me of I said I would not make any promise of the kind as he had strongly denied things that I had accused him of before - I sent my servant for an officer who came and took him he said when the officer came that the fire-irons were in pawn for 8s at Mr How s in Broad-street St Giles - I went there and the pawnbroker took the trouble to look over his book but they were not there his shopman then said that his mother had been there - the irons were not found there but the officer got them Prisoner JOHN MACDONALD You said if I confessed you would forgive me and when I confessed he sent for a constable A No I said if he confessed where a pair of trousers and waistcoat were which I had lost I would forgive him but he would not till the officer came and then he confessed he had been in my service about three months THOMAS GOOK On the night of the 9th of January I was sent for to take the male prisoner Mrs Joseph said something to me and then the prosecutor came in and said he had been robbed - I said Bring him up and as they were coming in at the door I heard Mr Joseph say Mind I make no promise I took the prisoner and searched him - I asked him were the articles were he said he took the fire-irons and gave them to a woman outside the door of Mr How s - she pawned them and he gave her a shilling he said he had sold the waistcoat and trousers for 8s - the carpet he took to his mother s I went to his mother s the next morning and found the carpet - I then went to where his mother was nursing and asked her where the fireirons were - she said she sold them to a young man named Glass for 1l we went to Glass - we then went to his sister s in Liquorpond-street and there we got them the female prisoner was with me - she said she wanted the fire-irons that were sold by John Macdonald JOHN GLASS I bought these fire-irons of Jane Macdonald - she had been nursing my mother seven weeks previous to her death she came to me one evening and said she had a set of fire-irons to dispose of for a person in great distress and wanted 1l 5s for them I said I could not afford it at that time but if she would come again I would buy them - she came again and I offered her 1l for them she said she thought that would not do but she came again in a day or two and I gave her a sovereign - I offered her a shilling for her trouble which she refused Gook came to me - I took him to my sister s and there delivered them up to him on the 5th of December BENJAMIN JOSEPH re-examined I missed the fireirons about six weeks before this date and the carpeting about a fortnight before I can swear to these fire-irons by handling them and having so many sets of them - I know the pattern and had missed them I mentioned them to the prisoner and he said You are always accusing me I said I have a right to accuse you for I never lost any thing before you came and am continually missing things now - I said I had more fire-irons than I had then in my shop he said You don t know what you have got and you think you have got thieves about you I had given him warning to quit me a fortnight before the 8th of January in consequence of the trousers and the waistcoat I found out the carpeting a fortnight before - when the officer came I said You rascal you have robbed me of carpeting and it is up at your mother s house he said I have robbed you of nothing but the carpeting and I hope you will forgive me - I am sure he said that Prisoner JOHN MACDONALD Q When you counted the carpet there were five breadths and there are five breadths there now A No -

t18290219-153  679 JOHN BOLTON was indicted for stealing on the 9th of February 1375 brushes value 68l 400 brushboards value 30s 400 brush-veneers value 12l 80lbs of bristles value 20l and 21 tooth-brush stocks value 20s the goods of William Bracey Kent his master GEORGE NICKIN HICKMAN I am in the employ of William Bracy Kent brush-maker of Great Marlborough-street The prisoner was in his service and used to fetch the work to finish at his own house he only took them when they were in a certain state of preparation we received information and went to his house No 18 Great Smith-street Westminster one Monday in this month but I do not recollect the date I went into the workshop and found a large number of veneers - veneers are sometimes delivered to him from time to time with the brushes but no more than he has occasion for we then looked into a loft over the workshop and found as many as twelve gross more of veneers I remained in the workshop - the officer and Mr Kent went up stairs to a room on the second floor they then called me up and pointed out a large number of brushes which had been found I went with an officer to the back kitchen and opened the drawers in every drawer but one there were brushes some in a finished and some in and unfinished state - we removed the drawers and found a quantity behind them thrown down indiscriminately - and among some candlesticks in the cupboard we found some more brushes and on the landing near the garret we found a box filled with veneers then a second box filled with veneers which we brought away I did not find any veneers different to those he would have delivered to him to work upon but it is utterly impossible that he should have had forty gross of veneers delivered to him more than he had brushes - they are for the backs of brushes we have missed a large quantity at different times and particularly of one sort of which we found a great number at the prisoner s we took stock about eighteen months ago and then had a considerable quantity of black veneers of which we lost a great many afterwards Cross-examined by MR CHURCHILL Q Is Mr Kent here A No he was before the Magistrate but was not asked any questions some of these were in a cupboard - some pieces of paper pieces of string candlesticks and other things were before them - there were shelves in the cupboard we found brushes in nearly every drawer and things upon them - many of the brushes we found in his house were not in a state in which he ought to have received them or to have returned them - they were what we call French polished and that is done by another man after him he has a workshop and materials there - I believe journeymen do work for themselves I have known a man take work from two masters COURT Q Does your master ever give out 1375 to work at one time A No I should think the extreme number that is ever delivered out to one man is two gross we have missed a great deal of property HENRY ROBERTS I received four boards to draw froma person who was to do them for the prisoner I knew them to be Mr Kent s property - I took them to Mr Kent and he got a warrant Cross-examined Q Did you leave Mr Kent A Yes I left him of my own accord - I have worked for him a person of the name of Church entrusted me with 30s worth of brushes and they were lost by my lad I told Mr Church of it and he said he was very sorry and would give me work to work it out I never sold them to any person in Fleet-market BENJAMIN SCHOFIELD I am an officer I went and searched the prisoner s house on Monday the 9th of February - we found the prisoner in the kitchen and took some hair from there - we then went to the second floor saw a closet on the left hand which I requested him to open he hesitated a good deal - but when I said I should break it open he took the key from his pocket and unlocked it he said there was no property there belonging to Mr Kent and repeated it - I saw it was an immense large cupboard and there were a great number of packages I took some out - some of them contained twelve and some six brushes Mr Kent observed some writing on the papers and said This is my property and the writing I know the prisoner said it was his own writing - that the brushes were his own making for an East India order and the whole of the stamps were his own stamp I believe I took about five hundred packages out of that closet the greater part were identified by Mr Kent and Hickman I then went into the kitchen and saw the property found in the bureau and under a sofa-bedstead I found a box of hair which Mr Kent identified GEORGE AVIS I am an officer I was with Schofield when the search was made - what he has stated is correct I produce twenty-one ivory handles which I found in one of the drawers in a middle room - only a part of the property is here there were a great many things - a van load full MR HICKMAN I could not identify these handles but I know some of these brushes they have Mr Kent s name on them - I have no doubt they are his some of them had French polish on them Cross-examined Q Is not this one quite finished and in a fit state for sale A Yes Mr Kent sells a great many I cannot swear that he has not sold this one here are some unfinished which I can positively swear were never sold in that state they ought to have been returned by him to Mr Kent - these might have been delivered to him HENRY ROBERTS These ivory handles were not delivered to the prisoner - it was a suggestion of Mr Kent s to have six brushes to one handle - other manufacturers might have had such this one brush has my writing on it - it was for an Irish order and we had to make some others to complete the order I will undertake to swear that these were never delivered to the prisoner I was the borer of them and this has my writing on it MR HICKMAN These brush-boards were never delivered to the prisoner for any purpose whatever there are persons who make them on their own account but it is not the prisoner s trade Cross-examined Q Do you know the reason why Mr Kent is not here A He is unwell - he has sent his books here because he wished the prisoner to have every assistance in his power - I do not know that the prisoner is charged with stealing any super satin brushes - are two horse brushes which were never delivered to him they are out of his line the prisoner stated they were all his own and that he made the patterns himself and they were bored by a man named Griffiths MR CHURCHILL called - MR CHURCH I employed Roberts six or eight months ago I have had an opportunity of forming an opinion of his character I would not believe him upon his oath COURT Q Why A Because he has sold my property and never returned me the money for it he worked for me and said he could sell brushes and I let him have 30s or 2l worth which he sold and brought the money I afterwards let him have 4l worth he sent me 15s by his son and the rest he said his son had lost - that was in June I did not prefer a hill against him on account of his family and it is a great deal of trouble and expense MR CLARK I am a brush boarder These boards are nothing mysterious - I can observe nothing particular at all in them except bad workmanship I do not think any man can swear to them without a private mark on them - I have been in business three years - we cannot distinguish one man s work from another except they are marked - I have known the prisoner about four months - it is not an unusual thing for a brush-maker to make an entire brush on his own account I should not have been surprised to have found such boards at any brush-maker s shop it is not uncommon for a journeyman to work for two masters COURT Q Do you know what part of the trade the prisoner s business is A I have understood he is a brush inlayer and finisher - there is no hair in these boards it is not common for a journeyman to have near fourteen hundred brushes or to keep them in cupboards or drawers that is not the way I do Prisoner s Defence I have been employed by Mr Kent about fourteen years I worked for him for the first four years and was than discharged for about six months Mr Kent sent for me again and I have worked upwards of nine years for him about four years ago I was employed by Mr Barnes for an order for the East ladies for 100l Mr Hutchinson and Mr Leigh saw the brushes when they were manufactured I have since then worked for Mr Robinson of Burton I manufactured brushes out of my old stock and a great many new ones I bought of Mr Kent I had a large stock in hand and did expect that in a short time I should have started for myself and got rid of it in the meantime I had been particularly careful in making up accounts at the ware-house the work was delivered to me before three or four witnesses - I never had an opportunity of purloining one single brush and every Saturday night or every fortnight I made a clearance of the books there was not one out against me I have sent in brushes of my own to make up Mr Kent s number I am capable of making brushes of any sort Griffiths has been in my employ I invented a machine which he bored with - it was impossible for any one to purloin a single brush out of the prosecutor s premises I was only admitted there once a week JURY to GEORGE NICKEN HICKMAN Q Did the prisoner come backwards and forwards to the warehouse forwork A Yes once or twice a week and used to take it away in his bag GUILTY Aged 58 Transported for Seven Years

the prisoner was in their employ as confidential shopman On the 26th of March about nine o clock in the evening I saw the prisoner come from the warehouse with a parcel under his arm I followed him on to Piccadilly and then desired to know what he had in the parcel - he observed his coat only I said I was not satisfied with that and wished to see what was in it he then said some linen as well - I said I was not satisfied and desired him to walk back with me to the warehouse on reaching the warehouse I found the articles here produced and some linen in the parcel - the piece of silk was in his pocket the articles are worth at least 4l 10s - he said he could not account for them they have my private mark on them and are the property of my employers Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q What is a confidential shopman A He was a man who had been in the employ some time and we had confidence in him - I have no part in the concern the warehouse is connected with the house - he came out at the private door I followed him I think about a mile - I am quite sure he said he had a coat in the parcel he did not say the goods had been purchased by a customer MR PHILLIPS Q He said he could not account for their being there A He did sir Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Was there a band found in the parcel A There was a black silk band - I do not know whether it is here JOHN JOHNSON I am a Police-man The prisoner was given into my custody - I received these articles in a bag from off the table at Mr Sewell s I have not seen the band MR CLARKSON to MR BEMAND Q Did you hear the prisoner s defence before the Magistrate A He made no defence he has not stated from whom he received the band nor mentioned it to account for the possession of them - I have produced all the property belonging to Sewell and Cross I will swear it has never been paid for and I swear it has not been sold - if it had it must have been paid for and it is not down as paid in our books which are here all our people are not here -I have not heard that they had been paid for with a 5l note which has been traced to the Bank if these goods had been sold and paid for it certainly would have been down in the books but I had observed the goods concealed nine days before they were carried from the house- I did not tell the Magistrate this I know Miss Priestly- the Magistrate would not allow me to state any more he said I had stated sufficient - I said I had suspected the prisoner for some time he said There is no occasion to go further - that was my way of attempting to tell him the goods were concealed I do not know wherethe band is - I have done nothing with it it was not in the bag it was in his pocket - he took it out and I laid it on a chair I believe the officer took it - I saw him take the goods I have not heard the prisoner state that his means of defence were the production of that band MR PHILLIPS Q Is it the custom of your shop to enter immediately any articles that may be sold A Yes and if the prisoner had sold these goods it would have been his duty to have entered them I have brought the books to show there is no such entry - I told the Magistrate what I have stated to day about finding the goods and he said there was no occasion to state more I saw the prisoner given to the officer - he gave no account of the goods MR PHILLIPS to JOHN JOHNSON Q Did you hear him give any account of the property A No Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q What did you do with the band A I did not have it Prisoner s Defence written On the subject of the charge on which I now appear before you I declare most solemnly that the goods had been purchased by Mr Root s between one and two o clock on the day before who begged that I would take them home for him as he was going to Hammersmith and did not expect to return till late - I took the goods into my bed-room where they remained until the Friday evening I should have gone home on the Thursday evening as I promised Mr Roots but felt myself very unwell and therefore remained at Knightsbridge - had those goods been taken dishonestly it is not very probable that I should have allowed them to have remained so many hours in a place to which nearly forty persons had as free access as myself and had Bemand suspected me as he says he did there is no reason on earth why he should not have searched the room and found the goods many hours before in preference to waiting until I went out in the evening Again when he accosted me in Piccadilly did I not voluntarily return back with him Is it probable that I would have done so or that I would not have made some attempt to have got away if I had come dishonestly by the goods Certainly not - I knew the goods had been paid for and therefore I had no hesitation in returning The reason why I did not make this statement before the Magistrate and detail to him the way in which I became possessed of the goods and by whom and when they had been purchased was by the advice of my attorney Mr Hart because he found that Bemand and Chillicombe were endeavouring to get up other charges against me and that considerable property had been taken from my wife s residence which these persons swore to and that therefore my committal for trial was a matter of certainty I took his advice and made no defence ROBERT ROOTS I am a broker and deal in silks I went to Sewell and Cross ten days or a fortnight before this - I saw the prisoner and asked for a pattern of this silk he said there were twelve or thirteen yards of it -I said Put it by for a day or two I think I know a customer for it I called in about ten days bought it and also this black silk to match a band - I left the band and all these goods which I had bought for the prisoner to bring home I took an order from a lady in Cannon-row Westminster I bought this satin for trimming a bonnet- these socks are for my own children I have the bill here which the prisoner made - it is 4l 17s 5d I paid him a 5l Bank note I took the number and date at the time - it is 4 220 September 17 1829 I paid it on the 25th of March - I said I was going to the Camden Arms and from there to the Hand and Flower I asked him to take them home and he said he would if he could - we do not live far off MR PHILLIPS Q Of course you told him not to involve it in any secrecy A I said nothing about it I did not take them because I was going further - this article is for Mrs Davis and the other for Mrs Perkins they very commonly give me orders to buy silks for them- I have dealt in silks twenty years they live in our house - I do not think they are here they are both married - this is a collar for Mrs Davis a number of the shopmen were present when I bought these goods and I believe Mr Bemand was there I do not know whether he was behind the counter or not - the prisoner took the note and brought me the change he was to bring them to No 9 Sutton-street Soho I am not a housekeeper now - my house is pulled down I am lodging at No 21 High-street Bloomsbury - I do not keep any stock of silks ladies employ me on commission to buy silks and I get a profit on them - I generally call on them Mrs Davis had seen the pattern of this silk before - this ribbon was my own choice I had a stock of some thousands of pounds but I have been a bankrupt unfortunately - I did not tell the prisoner to say he could not account for having the things MR ADOLPHUS Q You told him to take them to your house A It is a common every day occurrence for me to call on ladies to ask if they want any thing and I give them a little accommodation this is the pattern the lady had seen - it has been in my possession coals wine and silks are often sold by persons who never have a stock of them I did not say any thing about what the prisoner was to say - the band was Mr Perkins and I left it with the prisoner - it has not been returned to me I went out of town on the Friday and did not know the prisoner was in custody JOHN BEETON I am a clerk in the Bank of England I have a 5l note which came into the Bank on the 10th of April - it is No 4 220 dated the 17th of September 1829 it has a name on the front of it Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Who paid it in A I do not know I did not take it in MR ADOLPHUS Q It might have been in a hundred hands A It might ROBERT ROOTS This is the note GUILTY Aged 27 -

his wife is still with me Gardner came to my house - I showed him the prisoner s room and saw him go into it RICHARD GARDNER I am an officer On Friday the 28th of April I went to the prisoner s lodgings which Patmore pointed out - a woman was there who said she was the prisoner s wife I saw a great many glasses on the sideboard and seized six in consequence of what the steward said - I afterwards went with the steward to Lord Henry Thynne s at Roehampton and apprehended the prisoner I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing the Marquis of Bath s plate and also some glasses - nothing was said to induce him to confess I cantioned him to say nothing to me that might hurt him hereafter - he said he knew nothing about the plate and that he had bought the glasses he mentioned some place and said his wife bought some of them - we came to town in my chaise the steward and him were in conversation and I heard him say to the steward If I must tell you I did take a part of the glass in consequence of that I again went to his lodging and brought away in all thirty-six glasses - I left about a dozen plain ones behind there are seven different patterns here Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q Did you hear all the conversation between him and the steward A Not the beginning of it but to the best of my recollection the steward told him the maker could swear to the glasses - his wife was at home when I took away the six I left her there returned in the evening and still found the rest on the sideboard MR ADOLPHUS Q You had him in custody all the time A Yes - I did not tell his wife I was going to apprehend him EDWARD BRAMSDEN I am steward to the Marquis of Bath While the prisoner lived there I missed glass several times once in particular from Longleat - on the 23rd of May as I came from Roehampton in the chaise with the prisoner I did not make him any promise or threat I told him these were Lord Bath s glasses - he said they were not I said I was quite positive of it and that Mr Beaumont could swear to part of them he had not furnished them all he then said I did take part of them - these are such glasses as were in the Marquis possession and to the best of my belief every one of them are his they are exactly the sort of glass I missed Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q Did you not tell him he had better admit the fact to you A Nothing of the kind - our coachman tells me he has visited the prisoner once he told me where he lived - I do not suppose he would know the glasses if he saw them he never waited at table - when the officer brought the six away I told the prisoner s wife that every glass belonged to the Marquis to the best of my belief and she said her husband bought them I brought away one of each pattern part of them were bought of Mr Brumsley and part of Mr Naylor - they were made to my order by an exact pattern which I have kept for the last eleven years I always furnish a pattern to have them made by except this one which is quite a new pattern in his Lordship s stock - here is one pattern I never saw any where else these two goblets are Mr Brumsley s pattern MR ADOLPHUS Q You brought away one of each A Yes here are two large goblets four of these six of another and six of each pattern wine glasses they are the exact pattern we use - I give out the glass MR ALLEY Q Are you not forced to keep up the stock of glass at your own expence A No I never paid for a glass the servants are never called on to pay for broken glasses - there is not an allowance made for it I would not live in such a family - when I want glass his Lordship desires me to get it and he pays for it THOMAS BRUMSLEY I am a glass-dealer and live in St James -street I supplied the Marquis of Bath with some glass here is one pattern of goblets of which he had two dozen on the 26th of March 1829 and on the 11th of July four dozen goblets similar to this pattern - I had sold the pattern before there are no more patterns which I can identify - I sell wine-glasses such as these but did not supply them to my knowledge Cross-examined Q These are not a new pattern A No I supply many noblemen and have sold a great many of this pattern - I can swear these came out of my shop but not that I sold them to the Marquis of Bath MR ADOLPHUS Q You sold the Marquis two dozen of one and forty of the other A Yes - I never sold the Marquis such glasses before these cut tumblers are about 30s a dozen and the goblets 36s - one pattern of wines 18s and the other 20s MR PHILLIPS to MRS PATMORE Q What floor did they lodge in A The first - I have gone in and out of their apartment and so have their friends I do not recollect Lord Bath s coachman coming to see them - these glasses were always on the sideboard MR ADOLPHUS Q How long had they lodged with you A From the 6th of March - they had only one room at 5s a week and furnished it themselves the sideboard is a shelf in a recess by the fire-place - they slept and lived in one room I did not observe whether the glasses increased or diminished after they came - I was not often in the room they brought the rent down to me generally Prisoner s Defence I have people to prove I bought the glasses JOHN SAWYER I live at Kennington - I am not in business I was in service I was in the brokery line in the New-cut about six months ago about Christmas and sold the prisoner some glass of this kind to the best of my knowledge looking at a tumbler - I cannot say how many I sold him - I think I sold him glasses like these two wines COURT Q You have now fixed on three patterns - take one how many did you sell him of that description A I cannot say - I keep no books I was only employed as a servant - there is no mark on the glasses they are patterns I was in the habit of selling and had generally in the house MR ADOLPHUS Q In what line are you now A In the book line - I live in Clayton-street Kennington I buy books at sales and sell them - I keep no shop I was servant to a broker nine months ago - his name was Laurence he lives in the New-cut now - he knew of my selling these glasses he is not here - I left him at Christmas - I was in his service nine months ago and left him six months ago - I had been in his service three years Q Then what do you mean by being his servant nine months ago A I was his servant for three years up to about six months - I left about Christmas there has been no glass like this brought to me since this inquiry - I was not before the Magistrate Q How did you know you could swear to any glass to-day A I was subpoenaed to attend and speak to glass which I sold him I could tell the pattern of every sort of glass I have sold for these twelve months - we sold a great many we bought them of the maker these large ones were bought of a man named Lazarus - we bought glass of that pattern of him and the same quality he lives in Houndsditch - we used to give about 2s 6d a pair - I sold them for 3s 6d a pair I am not acquainted with the prisoner - they found me out by going to Mr Lazarus to enquire for his servant they did not know my name - I sold him glasses three or four times but how many I cannot tell MR ALLEY Q It was not Lazarus but you that sold the glass A No NATHANIEL SELKIRK I am a glass manufacturer and have been in the trade three or four years - I have sold goblets of this description these patterns are to be found any where - I do not recollect having seen the prisoner or his wife MR ADOLPHUS Q Take that goblet up - what are they worth A I should be glad to take for such as these 2s 6d a piece that is 30s a dozen and these small cut tumblers I would sell at 16d each Prisoner I did not say what the witness states - I said if they were theirs they must be theirs GUILTY Aged 30 - Transported for Fourteen Years The indictment further stated that the prisoner had been previously convicted of felony but no evidence was offered on that point

t18300708-152  Third London Jury - Before Mr Common Sergeant 1411 JAMES PIKE was indicted for stealing on the 18th of February 100 lbs weight of blister-plaster value 20l and 50 lbs weight of pil colocynth with aloes value 20l the goods of Henry Field and another his masters and JOHN MONKHOUSE was indicted for feloniously receiving 40 lbs weight of blister-plaster value 8l and 22 lbs weight of pil colocynth with aloes value 8l 16s and part of the above goods well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c and DANIEL DUCK was indicted for feloniously receiving 60 lbs weight of blister-plaster value 12l and 28lbs weight of pil colocynth with aloes value 11l 4s the other part of the above goods well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c MESSRS ADOLPHUS and PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution HENRY HENNELL I am a chemical operator at Apothecaries -hall - Mr Henry Field is treasurer Pike was a labourer there on the 18th of February and had been there many years Mr Field is a member of the Company and one of the particular proprietors of these articles - they have lost a large quantity of blister plaster I know that by taking stock on the 25th of June - we do not exactly know whether any colocynth was missing but the quantity made and the quantity sold do not at all correspond - I have seen a quantity of blister-plaster since which from the particular size and weight of each parcel I believe to be the property of the Company they are in parcels of 1 lb each and from that and the length of the cylinder into which they are rolled I believe them to be theirs they could have been taken in February last - Pike left the service about six weeks back he had been fourteen or fifteen years employed in the laboratory making up these things - both the blister-plaister and the colccynth were kept in the department in which he was particularly employed - the blister-plaister was made up in 1 lb rolls the ordinary practice of the drug trade is to do it up in - lb rolls - there is a particular gauge in the use of the company they are always of one length - the pil colocynth costs the Company 10s a lb the selling price is 13s or 14s - the blister-plaister costs us 4s we sell it at 5s I do not know what they are sold at in other shops Cross-examined by MR STURGEON Q You say it is sold in 1 lb rolls A Yes I have made inquiry and have not found any other druggists who sell it so - I am not sure that our s is not a common gauge but if a particular cylinder corresponds with a particular gauge I consider it is the same - I do not know whether the general appearance of all blister-plaister is alike we use a particular sieve and from the general appearance of this pil colocynth I believe it is that made at the hall it is precisely similar in appearance and texture - I may be mistaken but every tradesman can tell the articles he has manufactured I do not manufacture this but it is made under my eyes - I believe it is very of ten made in this way there is no recipe in the London Pharmacopoe for it I have tasted it - it is excessively bitter but I am not putting bitterness as the test I have no other means of ascertaining it Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q Is not the Apothecharies Company a chartered Company A Yes - this is not the property of the Company but of Mr Field and others and they have all the profit to themselves they supply themselves with articles from the same market as all other druggists - there is nothing peculiar in the article sold to them other druggists make the same article and some with the same ingredients but the different manner of manipulation would make a difference- no two persons would proceed about any operation in precisely the same manner the blister plaister is in 1 lb rolls and in a particular cylinder - we never sell the colocynth in large quantities always in small quantities it is entirely an article of retail trade - many druggists sell cheaper than we do Cross-examined by MR CRESWELL Q Do you never sell it wholesale A Yes sometimes - the Company supply gentlemen who are members and would supply them in pounds there is nothing particular in the manufacture of this - the ingredients may be precisely the same all colocynth would be bitter but that I have seen elsewhere is of a darker colour approaching to black - except when exposed to the air ours is of a dark olive green I have no means of knowing how long this has been made - time will not have an effect on the colour through the whole mass if it had been kept a long time it would not go through - part of our colocynth had no doubt been made two or three years but it would in the interior be the same colour as if fresh made if some of ours had been made three years and some of another person s they would still differ in the texture - the mode of grinding and sifting would make a difference doubtless others might make it of the same texture as we do - no apothecary makes blister-plaister as we do but druggists make it of the same materials or they ought to do so I have seen other blister-plaister - I believe it is not the practice of other druggists to use any gauge at all but to roll out their blister-plaister I cannot tell the exact length of our gauge - other druggists might get such a one MR PHILLIPS Q If you saw a thing miraculously the same you would not know the difference A No we generally roll the blister-plaister in white demy paper but that is not exclusively used by the Company Mr Henry Field is one of the Company and there are other partners there was some blister-plaister done up in blotting-paper by mistake GEORGE AINGER I am a porter in the employ of the Apothecaries Company and have been so for seven years Iwas in the same department with Pike - it was part of his business to make up the blister-plaster and pil colocynth the plaster was generally done up in white demy there was a mistake about two years ago and it was done up in blotting-paper or filtering-paper - I think about 60lbs were so wrapped up I never knew any instance of their being so wrapped up but that - Pike was then in the employ there were two gauges used but the length of them was never altered they were kept uniformly the same - there was no change in the measure the pil colocynth was generally sold in pounds - I should think we never sold 13 ozs - it is wrapped in a bladder-skin this is 1 lb of plaster Cross-examined by MR STURGEON Q What is your reason for thinking they never sell 13ozs A Because it is an odd number I am not in the selling department - this demy paper is commonly used by apothecaries this filtering paper is particular Cross-examined by MR CRESWELL Q Let me look at the ganges A These are them - any boy might cut out such MARY ANN PEACOCK My husband has been transported by the prosecution of a gentleman named Ellis - I know Pike In consequence of something that transpired on my husband s trial I felt it my duty and it was my husband s wish that I should make a communication to the Apothecaries Company I have known Pike three years he was in the habit of coming very frequently to my husband s house we had a servant named Sheen she had an opportunity of seeing him come there I have a son named Phineas he saw him come there - Henry Jago had an opportunity of seeing some of the prisoners in our intercourse with them I know James Chapman - Pike used to come to my husband s three or four times a week generally he brought plaster and pil colocynth in a white paper covering in his pocket - he generally tore the covering off he never hesitated in saying that he got these things from Apothecaries Hall - Pike generally brought half a dozen rolls of blister-plaster at a time I suppose 4 cwt in all and a great quantity of the pil colocynth I cannot tell how much - I know Monkhouse and Duck we have had dealings with Monkhouse very frequently and have sold him drugs of all descriptions - I employed Jago to take a parcel to Duck and one to Monkhouse Jago was at that time in possession for King s taxes in my husband s house - Monkhouse has come very frequently but not for the last two years I know his son - he has sent him for plaster which he had bought - he told us he would send his son for it and his son has come accordingly I have seen Monkhouse and my husband together and have heard my husband tell him that the plister-plaster came from Apothecaries -hall I do not know whether any one else heard it except the servant in passing through the room Thomas Jolly was here called to prove the service of a notice upon Monkhouse in prison for the production of certain account books but he had not personally served it Witness in continuation - I went with my husband to Monkhouse generally every day for four or five years he did not ostensibly keep any druggist s-shop - we went into their living room and then Monkhouse would take them up stairs to a private room he gave 4s per lb for the pil colocynth but the last lot was 15lbs for which he paid but 30s - I was not there then he paid several prices for the plaster the outside price was half a crown a pound I have known him to buy it at 1s 10d I was present when these articles were found at Monkhouse s - I heard them count forty-three rolls of the blister-plaster - it was the same sort I had seen my husband take there and the same house the plaster was found in a box and some of the pills tied up in a bundle and some in a jar - the box was under several other boxes in the left-hand room on the first floor the pil colocynth was in the same place I have known Duck nine or ten years - I have been to his house and taken him plister-plaster and pil colocynth we got the same price for them of him half a crown and 4s - Duck I believe was apprenticed to a druggist and he kept a shop we have taken all sorts of drugs to him and to Monk-house when my husband was in prison I went to Monk-house and stated the situation my husband was in and he gave me 10s for him I went to Duck and told him he promised me some money but did not send it - I then sent Mr Chapman the Stepney carrier and received 5l from him my husband was in the Apothecaries Company -Duck called on us some years ago just as he opened his shop - my husband was not at home he said if my husband did not send him the goods according to his promise he would go to Apothecaries -hall and tell the gentleman what Peacock was doing I remember when Duck used to take these things he said he could recommend them to any surgeon as he knew they were genuine for they came from Apothecaries -hall I remember going with my husband and Jago to Duck in February last - we took 18lbs of the pil colocynth in a covered basket - Jago carried it and I went with my husband I saw my husband go into his house and I waited till he came out with the basket empty - this was on a Sunday morning he brought the money out - he had no money when he went in COURT Q When was your husband sentenced to transportation A The Session before last he was a chemist and druggist and lived in Thames-street Cross-examined by MR STURGEON Q You have said Pike always confessed that he took the goods from Apothecaries -hall A Not every time he did several times he lived at the hall - my husband used to say Here is Pike come from the hall Pike used to say he had brought so and so - he has mentioned Apothecaries -hall in my hearing he has said he brought the blister-plaster and the pil colocynth from there - I never asked Pike to give me 50l - I did not think he was worth it I did not think by bringing him here I should get my husband off I have done it at my husband s wish that we should give up one of the parties - I knew they were the goods of the Apothecaries Company I never had any money nor had any offered me - I have known him two or three years and he has brought these things backwards and forwards to our house - we were the intermediate messengers to the other parties there were other persons used to come but I have given up all the gentlemen wished Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q Your husband was a regular chemist and druggist A Yes we sold to two or three other persons besides the prisoner Duck is a chemist and druggist - he has practised as such and lately through Peacock he has been able to get up verymuch I did not tell of this till my husband was transported - I should not have done it now had it not have been for him I was aware of his guilty practices - I told it by his desire I have not bought any since he was away I can go to my husband at any time - I do not want to buy goods to follow him Cross-examined by MR CRESWELL Q Monkhouse has frequently come toy our house to deal A Yes but he has not come to the house the last two years his son has a few times he did not keep a druggist s-shop - I have known him four or five years I have seen these goods in his place- I believe he dealt in all kinds of articles a general dealer my husband has dealt in other articles - he has bought goods of Monkhouse I do not know what price my husband gave him - I do not know that my husband has returned him goods if they did not suit I do not know that Monkhouse has sent back 30lbs of goods as not approved of - I think if he had I should have heard it there was I believe very little but what I knew PHINEAS PEACOCK I am nine years of age I was examined before the Grand Jury I go to church and know I must tell the truth I know all the prisoners - I have seen Pike bring things to my father s house he brought pilacochia and blister-plaster - the other men have come there I have gone with my father to Duck s and to Monkhouse s Cross-examined by MR STURGEON Q How do you know it was pilacochia A My father told me so Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q Do you know where the things were got from A No I was taken up for presenting a cheque at a banker s Cross-examined by MR CRESWELL Q How lately have you seen Monkhouse there A Since Christmas MR PHILLIPS Q Who sent you with that cheque A My father I was taken before the Lord Mayor and set at liberty a week afterwards HENRY JAGO I am a porter I know Monkhouse but not Duck On the 28th of February I carried a parcel of pilacochia to Duck s but I did not go in - Peacock and his wife went with me it was in a little basket Peacock went into the house which they called Duck s and took the basket Mrs Peacock and I staid outside - Peacock brought out the basket empty I carried it part of the way home - Peacock put his hand into his pocket when he came out and showed some silver and two pieces of gold he said he had no money when he went in Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q Was the basket so heavy that you were obliged to carry it A I went to the shop but did not go in it was a doctor s-shop - I never went to his shop to tell him if he had any thing improperly come by to put it out of the way I do not recollect ever seeing him MARY SHEEN I was servant to Peacock for two years and three months I left nearly twelve months ago I knew Pike - he was a working man at Apothecaries -hall he used to bring blister-plaster to Peacock s and two kinds of pills - one blue pill and the other pil colocynth Monkhouse used to come and buy the drugs which came to the house Peacock told him they came from Apothecaries -hall - there was no certain time for Monkhouse s coming he came at all times sometimes in the morning and sometimes noon or evening - he bought goods and sometimes took them or his son came for them and sometimes Mr or Mrs Peacock took them I never went with any - I never heard Peacock tell Monkhouse that Pike brought them I have seen money pass between Peacock and Monkhouse - I did not know Duck sometimes if Mr Peacock was going out he would say to me Mary here is so much money - if Pike comes give it to him and I did Cross-examined by MR STURGEON Q How do you know that Pike brought blue pills and pil colocynth A He told me so Monkhouse used to buy drugs and so did others but I only want to speak of him now Cross-examined by MR CRESWELL Q Peacock carried on a large business A Yes and had several persons dealing with him - I have seen him deal with other persons - I have taken goods to other houses and I have seen money pass MR ADOLPHUS Q He bought of other people besides Pike and sold to others beside Monkhouse A Yes - he kept no shop his name was not on the door MR JOHN ELLIS I am a druggist and live in Thames-street The price of blister-plaster last year was 4s 6d or 5s 6d a lb if sold in large quantities - I should think that a low price I never bought any at Apothecaries -hall we make but little pil colocynth but I should think the value of this was about 12s per lb we make the blister-plaster in pounds and half-pounds generally in pounds I went last Wednesday fortnight to search the premises of Monkhouse - it is quite a private house no appearance of business just as we were coming away we found a quantity of blister-plaster - he was not at home at the time we searched the back yard and the shed - we then went up stairs and found a room with a variety of drugs opium scammonia and other drugs and 40lbs or 50lbs of blister-plaster in a box under some other boxes I heard Monkhouse say he bought it of the East India Company at some of their sales - I think he did not give any other account except of some opium which I suspected from its quality to be mine I saw a book on a desk on the right-hand side containing various entries - one was some opium at 14s and the letter P on it and one was Peacock March 3 1 9s - I should think the price of isinglass was from 12s or 14s to 17s 6d at that time Cross-examined by MR CRESWELL Q Whether the isinglass was good or bad you do not know A No nor whether it was cut or not I saw some isinglass that was cut but I do not know whether it was that or not - there were drugs of various descriptions I think no other articles - it had not the appearance of a general dealer s the room being up stairs and a bed-room next to it there were goods enough to allow the inference that a person dealt in these goods generally I do not know whether he was a licensed general-dealer but there was a desk and a book containing various entries Cross-examined by MR STURGEON Q Then other chemists are in the habit of selling 1 lb rolls of plaster A Yes but I never saw any in this form COURT Q Do you think the maker of a mass of pills of this description is likely to know his own manufacture A I should think he may but I am not in that department JOHN NEWCOMB I am an officer of Union-hall Onthe 30th of June I took a search-warrant to Monkhouse s with the last witness and Mr Hennell his house is No 16 Fair-street Horslydown - there is no shop nor appearance of business he was not at home - it was about half-past eleven o clock in the day we searched the room down stairs and then the back premises - we found nothing there we then went up-stairs to the left-hand room on the first floor - there we found a quantity of drugs wrapped in paper and in boxes they were not put on shelves - there was no counter a pair of scales were in the room which would weigh about 2lbs - there was no shopman or boy no customer came while I was there we were there I should think an hour and a half - we found some blister plaster in a box which had some parcels on it this is the plaster - while we were there Monkhouse came in he could see we had those things - I showed him my warrant and asked whether he could give any account of this plaster to the gentleman with me- he said he should give it at another place I then took him to Union-hall - I believe Mrs Peacock s name was mentioned but I do not recollect here are about 22 lbs of pil colocynth which I found at Monkhouse s - seven pieces were in an earthen jar and one large piece tied up in a brown paper Cross-examined by MR CRESWELL Q You say these things were concealed A They were in a box and some things on it there were many articles there - there was a desk and a book there was no chair in the room - there were some parcels the box was not locked - there were parcels on it and some goods in front I could only see a part of the box - the room was not locked a box by the side of the desk was locked COURT Q Was there any thing like a collection of goods except in that room A No GEORGE AINGER re-examined Q Are these rolls of plaster made up as such articles are made up at Apothecaries -hall A They are here are some of them done up in blotting-paper or filtering-paper - I think the other came from Apothecaries -hall the are gauged before the paper is put on - they fit the gauge exactly from the softness of this pil colocynth and the strong smell of the oil of cloves which it has it has every appearance of being such an articles as was made at the hall Cross-examined by MR CRESWELL Q Is it not genearally made of oil of cloves A Yes but it depends on the quality and quantity of the oil - the Company sell a great quantity of oil to apothecaries but a great number of druggists draw their own oil if they bought oil at the hall it would be the same - I have no other test but the smell of the oil and it is possible for a chemist to make the same of the same materials Q Now take this roll of plaister in your hand and measure it by your gauge does it not fit as near as any of the other rolls A It does fit as near as they do without the paper - I apprehend it always preserves the same bulk as when it is first made I never tried - it is affected by heat and cold heat makes it soft and cold hardens it but I am not aware that they affect its bulk - I have never tried that we make them in copper pans - they are beat with a stick and then rolled with the hand they are commonly rolled in white demy but some of them are in filtering paper - the one you have given me is in white demy the same as the Company generally use MR ADOLPHUS Q If a man had one of these rolls might he not make up others like them A Yes certainly - I am not aware that they expand or contract with heat or cold Monkhouse s Defence I bought them in a regular way of business Duck s Defence written I have been brought before you on a charge of which I am wholly innocent I was taken into custody on Saturday and after being carried about from the Court of King s Bench to the Mansion-house and detained several hours I was conveyed to Newgate I have not therefore had those proper opportunities that I ought to have had which would have enabled me to disprove the evidence of Mrs Peacock and other witnesses for the prosecution who are connected with her and show them to you in their real character a witness whose husband is already under sentence of transportation I am therefore compelled to have recourse to such evidence on my behalf as the immediate necessities of the moment compel me to bring forward I have hitherto supported myself in my profession with credit and respectability and brought up a family and I hope and trust that you will weigh with great caution the evidence of such persons as have been brought against me when contrasted with those respectable men who have this day come forward on my behalf WILLIAM NEALE I live in Tooley-street and am a chemist and druggist - I have been so for fifteen years I compound blister plaster - it is the custom of the trade to make it in half pounds generally but sometimes in pounds this is the usual way of making up pounds - I have dealt with Monkhouse for many years he is a general dealer- he has bought things at the Custom-house sales his character has been strictly honourable as far as my transactions with him have gone no man more so and I have heard him spoken of so by his neighbours MR ADOLPHUS Q You say this plaster is usually made in half-pounds do you know how they make it at Apothecaries -hall A No I never bought any there -I do not know who made this piece which has been put into my hands it is usually put in white demy paper- what we usually use is outside printing demy he is a general dealer - he deals in soy drugs oils and dye goods he has lived at that house for many years - the usual way for general dealers is to have a warehouse MR CRESWELL Q Have you bought a great many things there A Yes - at the back of his house there is a considerable warehouse sometimes general dealers buy goods and sell them again without taking them home- I should think this paper is such as is generally used MR STURGEON Q Could you speak to the manufacture of any of your articles A No JAMES REYNOLDS I am a general dealer - my warehouse is No 7 Holborn-bridge but I reside nearly opposite Astley s Theatre - I have known Monkhouse fifteen years he is a general dealer and buys almost all sorts of articles - I have bought a great many things of him and seen him buy a great many he is a very honest upright man - he has attended sales at the Custom-house and Excise I believe he is a licensed dealer in tea pepper and coffee MR ADOLPHUS Q What did he deal in A Any articles he thought bargains he has dealt in cheese butter pork brandy gin rum vinegar and pepper - I have known him deal in these within the last two months I believe he has dealt less in drugs than almost any thing - I have bought bread and tons of butter and biscuit at his house PIKE - GUILTY Aged 45 MONKHOUSE -

the prisoner was a stone-seal engraver in my employ he had formerly lodged in my house but did not at this time - he was paid by the piece for what he did and might always earn five guineas a week Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q What is the name of your firm A Halfhide and Co but I have no partner - my son manages the business but has no share in it I never allowed him to pawn any goods but I have pardoned him for it upon a promise that he would not do it again I said before Mr Metcalf that I was aware a fork had been pawned by the prisoner - he never left my employ I took him from the board I have heard that he has worked for Mr Metcalf - I gave a seal to Mr Metcalf to do and he gave it to my own man to do it I will not swear that Mr Metcalf Jun did not tell me the prisoner worked for his father as well as for me but I have no knowledge that he did - I do not know whether Mr Metcalf is in business for himself or not - they are in opposition to Mr Strongitharm in Pall-mall my house is at the other end of the street I did not know the prisoner was working for Mr Metcalf - he was to work for me only I only knew it by seeing his book when he was taken up -I have no recollection of knowing it from Mr Metcalf the prisoner had lived with me about thirteen years - he was a good workman and would have been of value to any one who employed him - the prisoner s uncle has been employed in my house for fifty years - I have given him seals to engrave partly for amusement he was principally supported by me - I was brought up with him and had it not been so I should not have taken the prisoner Re-examined Q Did you ever commission him to pawn any thing A No I had no communication with Mr Metcalf till I found something out - I had no knowledge of his going into Mr Metcalf s employ JOHN D METCALF I have known the prisoner as long as I can remember he came to me some time ago making a communication about some fancy stones - I think it was some time in October he said he had a few fancies to sell - I said if they were worth any thing I would buy them of him he wanted 1l or a guinea for them - I said I had no objection to give him that he then brought six fancies - I just looked at them but I can scarcely swear whether they had impressions with them or no - they were common place sort of things but I bought them I mentioned to him that a year or two since I was over at his house and bought a book-case and in the drawer were a number of what we call working impressions - I said They are of no use to you will you let me have them he said There is one I should not like to part with the others you may have if you like and I had them there were three or four dozen of them - the stones I bought of the prisoner went out of my hands into the hand of Mr Jones Mr Halfhide s jeweller I have seen six stones which I believe were the same I gave to be set I gave them to the officer - to the best of my knowledge they were the same I gave to be set I gave an indefinite order to mount them in good mountings - they were of ideal value Cross-examined Q But you would not take upon yourself to swear to them I should think A No I should think no one could without a private mark - the prisoner has occasionally worked for me and my father I never mentioned it but either the prosecutor or his son said I suppose it will be Brown from Halfhide s and Metcalf from Strongitharm s - the prosecutor and the officer were present at the time my father and I are in opposition to Mr Strongitharm - I remember the prosecutor speaking in reference to some spoons off which the crest had been removed he said he had no objection to his pawning so long as he brought things back - the prisoner has worked for my father for a number of years to my knowledge he has occasionally given him work to do - he has borne an honest character MR ADOLPHUS Q Was this declaration respecting pawning after the prisoner was in custody on this very charge A Yes he was alluding to a spoon and when he saw the crest was filed off he said he could have no intention of returning that - and what he said about Brown from Halfnide s and Metcalf from Strongitharm s was said in my shop - the prisoner was employed at Mr Halfhide s constantly but at his leisure hours he might do a job occasionally he might have done two arms in the course of last year for me - he did more for my father I do not know how many - I know my father has often said Brown has got so and so THOMAS LINSCOT I am in the employ of Mr Lawton a pawnbroker in Green-street Leicester-square I havefour duplicates I can speak to three of them as being what the prisoner pawned here is a silver lid on the 23rd of November 1829 a seal on the 20th of November 1829 and a seal ferrule on the 12th of March 1830 - the other article is a book of engravings which was pawned on the 22nd of January but I did not take it in they are all pawned in the name of Jones - I lent 4s on the seal 10s on the ferrule and 5s on the lid I did not know him by any other name than Jones Cross-examined Q Had you known him well A Yes perfectly well THOMAS VESPER I am shopman to a pawnbroker I have a silver table-fork and a seal ferrule pawned together on the 4th of August 1829 I cannot swear by whom they were never renewed but have remained in our possession - I lent 20s on them in the name of John Brown HENRY GODDARD I am an officer On the 28th of October I took the prisoner at the prosecutor s shop I produced to him this card of impressions and asked what he had done with the stones which made them he said he had sold them to Mr Metcalf a fortnight or three weeks before - I searched him in the shop and found in his breeches pocket a cornelian stone with the figure of Hope on it I had made him no threat or promise - I took him to the office and then searched his lodging in Newman-street in consequence of information I received from Mr Halfhide - I found a woman who acknowledged herself to be his wife but I had not seen them together I found at his lodgings the duplicates of the property which has been produced and some others COURT Q Did you find the duplicate of the tablefork A Yes and of the seal-setting on the same duplicate pawned for 1l on the 4th of August 1829 I also found the four duplicates of the articles pawned at Mr Lawton s -I have the six seals and an eye-glass which I received from Mr Metcalf these seals exactly correspond with these impressions Cross-examined Q Then the prisoner told you at once he had sold these stones to Mr Metcalf A Yes I did not know Mr Metcalf at that time - I never saw the prisoner at his lodgings nor the woman and him together I did not ask the prisoner whether he had engraven these things himself MR METCALF re-examined These six seals are the same as I received from the jeweller to whom I gave the stones to set - and to the best of my belief these impressions correspond with these seals they appear so to do but I think some have been taken since they were mounted and some before - these two seem to be taken before they were mounted they appear to tally two stones can be engraven so nearly alike as to give the same impression - the impressions appear like these stones but I could not say they came from them unless I were to take an impression and examine them with an eye-glass and then they might be so imitated that I could not tell - I have no reason to doubt that these are the stones I gave to be mounted but I could not swear to these they were away for a week or ten days - here are seven impressions on this card and six of them correspond with these stones I have known the prisoner many years - he lived in Castle-street Leicester-square and then he said he lived in Newman-street I understood from himself that he was married I do not know whether he had any children Cross-examined Q Is not Newman-street a street in which a great many artists live A I do not know - there is nothing to prevent the jeweller who set these stones from being here there was nothing clandestine in the prisoners dealing with me - I gave them to the same man to set who works for Mr Halfhide there are a great many of these impressions in the trade MR HALFHIDE I sent the officer to his house in Newman-street - it is a house of my own and he lived there the woman was his wife - she had been a servant of mine and married from my house these are the impressions from the stones which were taken from me and these are the stones - they are some very fine ones which I bought a great many years ago I have no doubt in the world of their being mine no more than I have of being here - this seal ferrule is mine I came to town and charged the prisoner with stealing the stones - he denied it I did not hold out any promise or threat to him - I told him I knew he had sold these stones and where he had sold them he then said he had taken them - this other seal was found in his pocket this duplicate of the fork was found in an old pocket in the house in Newman-street - this silver lid is mine and this book I valued these stones at 6s 6d each which is a low price I never gave him any power authority or commission to pawn or sell any one of these things COURT Q Is that spoon in the state in which it was A No there was a crest on it and a coronet but they are filed off - I had applied to a pawnbroker before and they said they would not take in a spoon with a crest and coronet on it Cross-examined Q Was any one present when he told you about these stones A No not at first but he confessed it before the officer the impressions on these stones are private-marks - they were done by the prisoner s uncle it is so difficult a thing to do the same work on two stones that I do not think it quite possible there may be hundreds of impressions of a leaf similar to this but not like it - there may be imitations but not fac similes I believe no man could imitate one of these and place them before me without my being able to see the difference - I differ from Mr Metcalf in that respect I do not know that he can see better than I though he is a young man - his father has been a great many years in business here is no private-mark on this seal but the work and here is a bull s head on this one which cannot be seen with the naked eye - I have no private-mark on any of them MR ADOLPHUS Q Can you put a mark on a cornelian stone A Yes - there is a particular manner in which artists view seals so as to know them it is very difficult to do two things alike - I had a spoon-fork like this with a crest on it Prisoner s Defence The spoon-fork and lid are not Mr Halfhide s they were given to me and he was fully aware of what I had done with them twelve months ago- he said he would not have prosecuted me if he had not had a jealousy that I worked for others I am indebted to him and he stated a few weeks ago that he would either arrest or prosecute me - if he arrested me he said he supposed I should take the benefit of the Act these impressions have been in my possession for years - someI had from Mr Aspin s and a brother of mine who worked there collected them I have done some of them myself - I have done work at my own house and sat up nights and nights together and even worked on Sundays that the prosecutor s work might be finished I remember eighteen months ago a stone was broken and I worked on the Sunday to do another and went with him to take it home - it is through maliciousness that he has got up this prosecution because I had worked for other people my uncle worked at the same shop before he went apprentice and for the last two years my uncle being infirm and hard of hearing I have done work for him unknown to my employer Mr Halfhide has been in the habit of looking out little stones for my uncle to engrave - I have done dozens and dozens which have gone to India GUILTY Aged 32 - Transported for Fourteen Years

t18301209-62  Before Mr Sergeant Arabin 63 JAMES SURGOOD was indicted for stealing on the 12th of November 1 truss of hay value 18d 1 sack value 2s 3 bushels of bran value 3s and 2 pecks of chaff and beans mixed together value 9d the goods of William Stevens his master and WILLIAM INGLE-DON was indicted for feloniously receiving the said goods well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c WILLIAM STEVENS I am a tanner and live near Uxbridge in Middlesex Surgood was my carman and was employed to carry my leather to town he had been with me about two years - on the 12th of November I sent him to town with a load of leather to my factor s in St Maryaxe I had previously marked three or four trusses of hay by putting little tally sticks into them and keeping the counterpart - I did not mark my bran or corn but I had noticed them and I had some bran chaff and beans in the stable and on the morning before he went to London I had three sacks of bran one of mixed corn nearly full and three or four trusses of hay which I had marked - when he was gone to London I went into the stable again I missed one sack of bran two trusses of hay and the sack nearly full of mixed corn - perhaps they were not regular trusses as they were our own binding up the two I missed were two of those I had marked - I allow my servants a regular quantity of mixed corn when they go to town about half the quantity I missed would have been sufficient for that but certainly no unmixed bran and about one truss of hay would have been sufficient or more than sufficient as there were only two horses after he was gone on the 12th of November I set off and overtook the van at Bayswater - it was standing at the inn I did not say any thing to Surgood at that time but I went on and met the officer - I suppose the horses were in the stable as I went by about ten o clock I saw Surgood in Oxford-road I said to him I have reason to suspect something is wrong at home have you left any hay or corn on your journey or any leather he said No not any - I replied Are you sure he said No not any but afterwards he said I left a part of my bait meaning the mixed corn - I then examined the caravan and found it contained a bundle of hay and the nose-bags were full containing I presume mixed corn sufficient I should say to bait the horses on their return home I then went with the officer to Marylebone Police-office and got a search warrant - we then went to the Swan inn at Bayswater where I had seen the van standing Ingledon who was the ostler there was standing at the door and several other persons we found one truss of hay in the yard - the officer asked Ingledon if he had not assisted in unloading the caravan and taken out some hay and some bran he answered indifferently he might or he might not as he continually did those things for men and he had not a perfect recollection - the yard we found the hay in adjoins the inn and I presume it belongs to it the horses could not get into the stable without passing through it - we examined the hay and it had the tallies in it we then went into the stable and in the loft over it we found a sack of bran in one of my cousin s sacks bearing his name and about two bushels of mixed corn in another of his sacks I sent another servant to London the next day to fetch home the caravan - the prisoner would have had to stop in London till I had purchased the articles he would have had to bring home perhaps two or three hours he usually arrived from ten to half-past ten o clock and would obtain his load by four Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You state his stay in London depends on the purchase of your commodities A Yes but the market ends before the day - he might stay till five o clock I do not measure the provender he has to take to town - it is left to his own discretion I should think he has been two years in my service it may be more the Swan inn is a place of very considerable resort for carts and waggons - the ostler has a great deal to do he said he might have helped him - I never was in the yard before but I have no doubt it was the property of the landlord there were a number of corn sacks in the loft - I think the bran should not have been taken into the loft it was up in a corner - I saw it through a hole in the stable I had not seen the ostler before to my knowledge - I believe I have related every thing that took place with the officer and the ostler in my presence Surgood is married but has no family HENRY JAMES PERRENCE I am a saddler I was asked to watch the van - I was waiting close by the Swan and saw Surgood come up with it I saw Ingledon cross the road from the van with a truss of hay on his shoulder but I did not see how he got it - he took it down the yard by the side of the Swan and put it on a crib in the yard where it was afterwards found - Surgood followed over with a sack full of something on his shoulder and in about ten minutes Ingledon went over to the van again and brought out a sack which appeared a new one full out of the front of the van Surgood then went and put some hay on the shafts on the front of the van and tied the tarpauling down over it - I told Webster the officer what I had seen I afterwards went to search the premises with the officer and found the hay where I had seen it left with the sticks in it Cross-examined Q Was this in open day A Yes it was about ten minutes before nine o clock and it is a public highway there was no concealment that I am aware of I was there with Mr Stevens and what he has stated is correct PHILIP WEBSTER I am an officer I have heard the account the last witness has given what he has stated is correct - I went to execute the search-warrant I saw Ingledon at the door - I knew him and he knew me I called him and asked what Mr Stevens carter had left that morning - he said he believed a little hay and he thought there was some loose corn also in the stable I said I wished to see the hay and he took us to it - I untied it and asked him whether any thing else had been left he said No not that he knew of - I am sure he said that we went into the stable and looked through the hole Perrence said I believe that to be the sack Ingledon made no answer but went and got a ladder - there were no means of getting to the loft without a ladder we got up and found the sack of bran - Ingledon said he did not know how it came there nor who it belonged to - I am sure I asked him if he knew how it came there and he said No I took him and the articles into custody Cross-examined Q Was not Mr Stevens with you A Yes I heard him asked if he had detailed all that passed and he said Yes - I have stated more but it is correct I could see the sack from below and so could any one - there were certainly many places in which it might have been put where it could not be seen it was a public stable into which any one might go - it is an inn which carries on a great deal of business but I think the ostler could not forget what had been left in so short a time the van stopped at a quarter to nine o clock and we went again at past eleven - it was not past twelve the master of the inn came to us - we were there twenty-five minutes or half an hour COURT Q As near as you can guess what time elapsed from your seeing the van unloaded to your search A I think an hour and three quarters as near as I can recollect Surgood I have been upwards of seven years with Mr Stevens as a regular servant and have witnesses to prove it he makes a memorandum of the time we are with him MR STEVENS He may have been so Surgood s Defence What I brought from home I fed my horses with from twenty minutes after eight o clock to near eleven what they did not eat I took further on and what they do not eat at all I take home - I am uncertain what time I shall stay I have waited six or eight hours in town - I have known Mr Stevens to buy three loads and I have to go and fetch them when my horses are knocked up I am obliged to stop three or four hours at the Swan because he overloads his horses so that they cannot get home - he has taken the bait from me when I got home Ingledon s Defence This man was in the habit of calling on his way to town and leaving the provender taking what he wants till he returns which is sometimes at six o clock at night others are in the habit of leaving provender there - when the officer inquired of me I said he had been there but I did not know whether he had left any thing I looked and said Yes he has and pointed it out among other provender of other men s - how the bran and corn came there I cannot tell SURGOOD -

t18301209-63  64 JEREMIAH COGHLAN was indicted for stealing on the 6th of November 19 chinchilla skins value 38s the goods of the St Katharine Dock Company to which he was a servant MR PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution RICHARD BAXTER I am superintendent of Police at the St Katharine-docks The prisoner was a delivery foreman there at the warehouse letter D - I took him into custody on the 6th of November he said he wished to change his coat and I took him to the warehouse - he unlocked the desk took out a coat and put it on and the coat he pulled off I locked in the desk and in doing so I saw in one corner of the desk these ten chinchilla skins - I asked him what they were he said they were skins he had found in another part of the warehouse and he had put them there for security intending to give them to Mr Palmer the warehouse-keeper but he had forgotten to do so I desired him to lock the desk and give the key to Mr Palmer - there were two hales of skins at the further end of the same warehouse I took him to the dock-office - Mr Palmer afterwards unlocked the desk and took the skins out he said he lived at No 5 Robinhood-court St Olaves - I went there with another officer and in a drawer in that house I found these nine other skins wrapped up in a pocket handkerchief I have compared them with the skins in the bales and they appear to me to be part of the same bales Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Are you any judge of these sort of skins A No some appear darker than others but they are packed in a different manner in the bales - I believe the prisoner has been in the service of the company from its establishment I do not know that there had been any person to inspect the bales of skins that day or the day before - if there had they would have been attended by some of the persons in the docks if any of the skins had fallen out it was the prisoner s duty to have given them to the ware-house-keeper immediately - I do not know that any crime would have been imputed to him if he had kept them two or three days I would as soon have suspected myself as I would him - I told him I had found these skins at his lodging he said those found in his drawer had been given him by a person whose name he mentioned who had been in England but was gone to America - I think it is not possible he could have overlooked the returning of the skins he had picked up MR PHILLIPS Q You found these skins at his lodging A Yes and I went back to him at night to take him to the Thames Police-office I told him I had found chinchilla skins at his lodging but did not say how many - he said nothing to me then I am sure what he said was before the Magistrate BENJAMIN BLABY I assisted in searching the prisoner s lodging and have had the skins which were found there ever since I said to him I have some skins I found in your house will you give any account of them - he said No I shall be before the Magistrate presently and I shall give the best account I can DAVID O CONNOR I am a marker in the St Katharine-docks I was employed in warehouse D in which the prisoner was foreman - I remember two bales of skins being brought in there I counted them when they came in - one bale contained three hundred and nine dozens and six skins and the other three hundred and ninety-eight dozen - on the 11th of November I counted them again and found the one which had had three hundred and nine dozens and six skins had only three hundred and four dozens and five skins and three pieces which was a deficiency of five dozens from that bale and three skins were missing from the other bale no delivery had taken place from them to my knowledge - I compared those found by the officer with those in the bales - I could not swear they are the same but to the best of my knowledge they are of the same description but I am no judge of them Cross-examined Q You do not affect to be a furrier A No - I cannot say when the bales had come to the ware-house it was about the 5th of October I think as near as I can guess - I believe they had been inspected by persons who had come for that purpose and the bales would certianly be opened to show them I was in the dock about three weeks before he was - he had had a good character it is possible some of the skins might have been left out which he might take up with a view to return them his son died last night WILLIAM PALMER I am warehouse-keeper of the warehouse D I have compared these skins with those in the bale - they appear to me to be the same if the prisoner had found any he should have reported it to me immediately or to have had them repacked - he had an excellent character Cross-examined Q Do you know he has lost his son A I am told he has - he certainly did not do his duty with respect to these skins I have known him sixteen or eighteenyears - he has always had a most excellent character there are perhaps a thousand men employed there Prisoner Q Did I not surrender the key of my desk A Certainly you did after you were in custody and you said that when looking for me or Mr Salmon to get men to effect a delivery you had got the skins which had fallen from a bale GUILTY Aged 43 Recommended to Mercy -

t18301209-88  OLD COURT SATURDAY DECEMBER 11 Third Middlesex Jury before Mr Sergeant Arabin 88 THOMAS HARDWICK was indicted for stealing on the 4th of December 2 bushels and 2 pecks of oats value 9s the goods of Sir Charles Flower Bart his master and JOB RUTHERFORD was indicted for feloniously receiving the same well knowing it to have been stolen MESSRS ALLEY and ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution SIR CHARLES FLOWER BART I reside at Hendon Middlesex The prisoner Hardwick was in my employ as carter - the Black Cap public house is in the way from Hendon to my town house in Russel-square it was his duty to convey things there and he had three horses under his care - he has been nearly two years in my service I placed confidence in him till I saw my horses falling off and getting very poor having before been very fine horses one of them cost me sixty-five guineas a year and a half ago - this excited my suspicion I had always given the greatest plenty of the best corn for them - I generally bought twenty-five or thirty quarters at a time On the 4th of December I was coming to town in my carriage and on stopping at my house a Police-officer gave me information - I went to Battle-bridge station and found Hardwick in custody with my team I did not hold out either threat or promise to him - I said Why Hardwick how could you be guilty of such a thing the great wages you have and the kindness myself and family have always shown you - I told him what I had heard from the office that he was charged with he said it was his first offence and he hoped I should forgive him - I said I could not do any such thing but after the kindness he had received I was astonished that he could do such a thing he still begged forgiveness - I said I could not attend to it I went before a Justice and he was committed - he had no authority to take any corn whatever out of his stable the horses should be fed before they come out of the stable in the morning and again when they go home at night - there was no licence for the carters to take any corn out of the stable they take a bottle of hay - my house is ten miles from town - he had no authority to dispose of any corn of mine Cross-examined by MR LEE Q I take it for granted you had a character with him A my bailiff attends to that - I never inquired about his character I am a good deal in town and seldom attend to the men - he always kept the key of the corn that was given out for the horses the bailiff placed the corn in a particular bin of which he kept the key - I believe the prisoner was going to Finsbury-square with a load of hay that morning I believe his wages were about 18s a week - it was 15s or 16s and hewas allowed 6d a day to spend and I generally tell my bailiff to give him a guinea at Christmas to make him comfortable I did not threaten or promise him at all but said I was astonished he could be guilty of such a thing MR ADOLPHUS Q Is a certain quantity of corn put into the bin for the horses A These two sacks he took himself from the waggon he told me himself he took them and put them into the bin on the Thursday afternoon - when I went down to Hendon I had my corn measured and after deducting a proper allowance for the horses there were two bushels and a half deficient MR LEE Q Can you take on yourself to say whether the horses had their corn that morning or whether it was for them A I know nothing about it but if they had had it there was that deficiency - he was not allowed to take the corn with him instead of feeding them in the stable and I never knew it done PHILIP WEBSTER I am an officer About half-past eight o clock in the morning of the 4th of December I saw the two prisoners at the Black Cap at Camden-town- there were four persons together and a cart loaded with hay I watched and walked by them to the end of Park-street which is about fifty yards - suspecting something I waited a few minutes and saw one of the four I believe Hardwick get out of the cart I saw him pull up a sack of something from between two trusses of hay it appeared about half full - he delivered it into the hands of Rutherford the ostler who was close at the side of the cart and received it from his hands - he then went up the passage with the sack on his back I ran as quick as I could and just as he put it down off his back at the corner of the building - I said What have you got here I then said Who does it belong to he said he did not know I asked him what it was and he said he did not know - I caught hold of the sack and said Then I must know I brought it back to the cart he walking before me - I then said Where is the carter and just at that time Hardwick came out of the public-house door Rutherford said This is him I said to Hardwick Is this your corn he said Yes it is I then said What was you going to do with it he said I was going to give it to my horses - they have not had any for these eight days and as I was going to town I thought it would do them good I said What all this impossible - here are at least two bushels of it I then untied the suck in the presence of both the prisoners put my hand down and brought oats from the bottom of it - it was all corn I tied it up pulled out my staff and said My name is Webster - I belong to Lambeth-street Office and you must both consider yourselves in custody and begged they would not go away I asked somebody to go and get another officer as I had from one hundred to one hundred and fifty people round me hooting and hissing me Rutherford said I shall not wait for you - I shall go about my business he then went to the right side of the horses took some hay from the cart and began to feed the horses - I saw a man who I knew and gave him the corn to take care of during this time Hardwick walked up the passage - I followed him as quick as I could I got looking into the different buildings for him and in what I believe to be the stable I saw a cask with the head out - it was half full of clover chaff mixed with a few oats I came out of the building and saw Hardwick coming out of the passage towards me - I took him down to the bottom and three or four Policemen came I gave them both in charge - I then went to look for the corn and the man I left with it said it was gone somebody had taken it - I immediately ran up the passage and within six paces of the stable where I had seen the cask a man ran out with an empty sack on his shoulder - he got on a high wall over some timber and made his escape I went back examined the cask and found it filled up with oats - I was examining the stable and looking at the corn the Policemen had let Rutherford go - he came running up the passage after me and said You have no business here - you have got no warrant he took me by the collar and said If you don t go I will knock you down I said I knew perfectly well what I was doing - I then came out and a young man said to Rutherford Knock him down - knock the b-r down I brought him down the passage again - Mr Butt the publican said Don t take any notice of that man he is only a busy meddling man - go to your horses and take no notice of him I put my hand on Butt and said Don t you meddle with me he said If you put your hand on me I will knock you down the ostler stood behind the cart - I said to the Policeman Take that man into custody he said he would not go I took hold of him myself and gave him to the Policeman- I said to Hardwick Now wherever you are going with the hay I will go with you I gave him into custody at last then went to inform Sir Charles Flower and got the oats Sir Charles name was not on the cart but a gentleman in a gig told me it was his Cross-examined Q Do not you know it is very common for persons on a journey to leave packages at inns A Very - I do not consider this was the case here chaff is very rarely given to horses alone at inns - the oats laid by themselves there was not sufficient time to mix them I am not certain that it was Hardwick who delivered the sack from the cart - I believe the corn found to be the same as I had given the man to mind he is an old man and I do not believe he saw it taken away - he is not here he kept his eyes on me all the while - he said he did not know who took it and which way he was gone Rutherford certainly could have absconded - he followed me to interrupt me from going to the cask SIR CHARLES FLOWER Hardwick was my carter and brought the team to town at least five times a week and generally every day - he always came by the Black Cap MR LEE Sir Charles has said his horses got out of condition - I ask him if he allowed them to go from his town-house ten miles there and ten back without food SIR CHARLES FLOWER No they had a bottle of hay which is a truss Hardwick s Defence When I got to Battle-bridge Sir Charles Flower got out of the carriage and asked how I came to do so - I told him that they had had no corn for eight days and I was going to leave it at the Black Cap to give it them when I returned the bailiff can prove they had no corn for eight days - he told me to take two sacks into the stable Rutherford s Defence He said to me I am come toleave some corn for the horses when they come back - they have not had any for eight days I never said I did not know what it was for - he told me when he took it out of the cart WILLIAM ROBINSON I am the bailiff I gave Hardwick two sacks of corn for the horses on Thursday the 2nd of December -

Foreman was in Mr Dixon s employ and was in the habit of passing the lock very frequently - there are dues paid at that lock for timber and other things which come through but latterly we have booked them for Mr Dixon on the8th of April between six and seven o clock in the morning I saw Foreman pass the lock in a direction from Mr Dixon s wharf with a stick of timber which was floating - I did not notice it nor any mark upon it I did not see him with any boat - he was pushing it into the lock I drew back the gate left one lock open and on account of its being a wet morning I went in and left him - he told me it was a job of his own and he would pay me for it in the afternoon it was entered in Mr Dixon s name in the afternoon when he paid me Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q How many wharfs are up that cut A There are several - I do not know what was the length of the timber I knew him perfectly well - I attended the whole of that morning MR BODKIN Q Could any person have got through your lock without your seeing them A Not very easily - no other piece of timber passed the lock from any wharf that morning Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Are you the only person who attends A I am the only lock-man there is another person attends to take the does - I was not up the whole of that night JAMES WHITE I work for Mr Astley a wharfinger at Stone-stairs Ratcliff On Friday the 8th of April I was at my master s wharf and saw Baxter the prisoner about half-past six o clock but I did not then know his name - a person they called Mr Rogers who had a black coat came with Baxter they wanted me to get ready to land a piece of timber for them and Rogers who appeared to be the owner of the timber said he was in a hurry for it for the sawyers were standing still and the building was standing still - they were both together I did not see any timber at that time but in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes Foreman brought a piece which appeared to me to he Memel timber - it was floating I noticed the race-mark of thirty-four feet - I did not see in what direction it came I was getting the handles and things ready - the tide was then coming up and I consider if it had been half an hour later it could have been landed more conveniently but they would make me get it up I told them I thought it was a pity to land it then to drag it through the mud but Foreman put the dogs to it - I saw no cart then we had it landed before the cart came - Mr Rogers then asked me what was the charge for landing it I said was he the gentleman that had been at my master s last night and said he had some timber coming - he said Yes I said You need not pay this now he said he would rather pay it now - they then walked with me down to my master and I said they had landed thirty-four feet of timber how much was it my master called out One shilling Jem and Mr Rogers asked Baxter for 1s which he gave him Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Are you sure they did not both pay the shilling together A It was very much like it - I have had conversation with Mr Dixon about this I have only seen him once before when I went to Lambeth-street - we landed this timber as quick as we could as it rained very fast I do not think there were any more men about the wharf - I would not have been there if these two gentlemen had not persuaded me I opened the gate and they asked who was the person to get the timber through - I said I was it might be five or six minutes in landing - the dogs are at the end of the iron chain which hangs to the crane the tide was not then up - the prisoners took the dogs as far as the bank and pulled the timber out it was some distance from the wall - it was then from half-past six to seven o clock I did not see it first come in sight - I was in and out getting the handles and things ready I did not see Foreman bring it- the first I saw of him was when he came to put the dogs - I cannot tell the length or width of it there was thirty-four cut in it with a race knife - there was other timber there but we had none come in that night or the day before there was no single piece came in for a week before or a week afterwards I am certain - Mr Dixon did not tell me the mark on this piece of timber I took notice of it to give an account to my master - I did not know either the prisoners or Mr Rogers I heard Mr Baxter s name at the office - I knew them by their clothes before Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q What day was this A One Friday morning - to the best of my knowledge five weeks last Friday - I do not keep account of the days Rogers acted as master of the timber as it appeared to me I have not seen him since MR BODKIN Q What became of the timber A The carman came and the prisoners and Rogers helped it into the cart JAMES ALLEN I am a carman On one Friday in April Baxter and Rogers came to me about half-past six o clock in the morning and asked if I would take a piece of timber down to Poplar it was a very wet morning and I said it was almost too bad to go out - they hurried me on and said they must have it done as their men were standing still - they both spoke together what one said the other heard - they asked what we would do it for I sent a lad up to ask master and he said 3s 6d - I went to Mr Astley s Stone-stairs wharf the timber was landed and we all helped to put it on the cart - I suppose it was then a quarter-past seven o clock it still rained very fast - I took it just beyond North-street bar Poplar I do not know whether it is Mr Baxter s ground or not but he told me to take it and said he would meet me there I did not take notice of the timber - it was only one stick Baxter paid me on the ground - he had one foot standing on the log when he gave me the money WILLIAM HOPEWELL I am a soldier and a blacksmith I know Mr Baxter and I know several buildings he has going on in the East India-road and some cottages at the back of the road I went to the North-bar to look for work one Friday morning about the 8th or 9th of April I think about half-past six o clock - I saw Baxter and Rogers there in conversation with each other I cannot tell what about - I saw by and by a stick of timber brought there and it went into a small gate Allen was the carman who brought it - it was put into Mr Baxter s yard and he rubbed his foot on the ground and then rubbed it on the timber about the centre of it I heard Rogers say Baxter you have no occasion to grumble you have got that timber cheap enough and he said It came by this holding up his fingers in a booked direction Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How long did you look at the timber A Perhaps ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - Baxter was building some premises or he was the master of some buildings in that neighbourhood - he rubbed his foot on the ground and then on the timber probably to take the dirt off his shoe Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q You heard it was cheap enough then of course you understood that some price had been paid A Yes some price COURT Q Did you see any mark on the timber when the foot was applied A No my Lord I did not BENJAMIN DIXON I am a timber-merchant and live in the Commercial-road - Foreman was my waterman and lighterman I knew nothing of Baxter On Saturday the 9th of April Foreman was taken into custody - I looked at my stock of timber after returning from the East India-road when the Policeman came to me I went with him to where the deals were and from there to Baxter s -I saw Baxter on his premises near the North-bar I said Is your name Baxter he said Yes - I said Of whom did you buy the deals he said Of Rogers I said Have you bought any thing else he said No - I said Have you bought any thing else of him at any time he said No - I asked him again he then said I bought some laths of him about a month ago I questioned him again if he had not bought any thing else of him at any time - his answer was No using the word in a positive tone I then said Where did you get the piece of timber from that lies over the way he said Oh I bought that of Rogers yesterday I went into the yard and saw the piece of timber of the thirteenth float thirty-four marked on it and three strokes then a cross and my name raced in with a knife by Foreman - the letters were robbed out as if with road dirt not the mud of the Thames - I rubbed it off with my hand and then saw the letters plainly they were about the middle of the timber - we generally mark it there that none may be cut off I bought it as Memel timber but I cannot swear to that - it was Baltic timber Rogers had worked for me as a lath-render for about four months but not at my wharf - Baxter told me he had known Rogers for five years I asked Baxter what he gave for it - he said 5l a load which would be 2s a foot - that would be 3l 8s I bought the whole float of the timber - he told me afterwards that he gave 2l 5s for the piece that was all I heard him say except before the Magistrate - it was after I saw Baxter that I examined my stock and missed a piece of thirty-four feet I had not sold any timber of the whole float - I had had it about three months COURT Q From whom did Foreman receive orders to carry out timber A From myself only and then not without a note - I have a young man but he does not give orders Foreman never attends to any thing he says - I am the only person who ever gives directions for the removal of timber Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When you went to Baxter s did you make yourself or your business known A I asked of whom he bought the deals - I did not tell him my name I did not mention the name of Rogers - I knew nothing of Rogers with regard to this transaction till he told me - I could not tell whether Foreman or Rogers took them he said he bought the laths of Rogers but I did not tell him he was my lath-render - I believe Rogers has absconded I have not seen him since -I have offered a reward to find him as I was going down the road to Baxter s a carpenter pointed out the piece of timber to me and said there was a piece which had come very suspiciously into the yard - that called my attention to it and when I asked Baxter he said he bought it of Rogers I believe Rogers was a thief but not the only one - I do not recollect that I have said that Rogers was the thief I will not swear I have not - the piece of timber was thirty-five feet cubic measure I gave 5l 5s a load for it - I gave 3l 11s for this piece it was not a damaged piece Q Now mind I warn you do you swear it was not a damaged piece A No Sir it was not there was at one end what we call a blee which was owing to the frost stinting it in its growth but it would not be considered a blemish - it would sell for quite as much and this being a clean piece would be preferred to many other pieces - it was in no respect injured I did not apprehend Baxter -I gave him notice to come against Foreman to attend and give evidence relative to the piece of timber the Magistrate had let him go after two examinations but we got additional evidence after that - we did not take him before the Magistrate again the Magistrate said he would not retract his steps I must take him before the Grand Jury -I had then got the witnesses White and the carman Allen they were not examined till the fourth examination - Baxter was not apprehended at all when we went before the Grand Jury - he was taken at his own house yesterday - he was discharged after the third examination I told him in his own yard that I should prefer a bill against him and asked him the reason he did not attend at the office - he said he had no order but mine and he should not attend to that Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Foreman had lived with you three or four years and Rogers as many months A Yes - I offered a man 1l to find Rogers Foreman did not tell me where to find Rogers - I do not think Rogers worked on his own account he was very much distressed COURT Q Do you know where Rogers lived A No I do not exactly This timber was taken from my Limehouse premises - Foreman was principally engaged there - he was all that Friday in that yard no timber sold on my account has been removed from my premises only little trifling things of a few shillings value - Rogers had no authority to sell he had no authority over the other workmen JOSEPH BEAL I am a Police-constable I apprehended Baxter at his own house yesterday Foreman s Defence On the Friday morning I was going to work and went and got 1d worth of coffee down by the dock-gates - I there met Rogers whom I had not seen for some time before he said could I do a job for him - I said I could not it got too near six o clock he said I might as well earn 1s which Mr Dixon allows us to do - he said Get a boat and take that timber and I will go and get the crane ready at Stone-stairs the tide did not set till a quarter to seven and he came twice to me to say what a while I was - I said if he could get a man to do it quicker I would go on he said No as I had the job I might go on - I took it up when there was water and then I was asked if I could not book it on I said No - I staid a quarter of an hour they then asked me again and I put the books and they took it up and paid the man for it Ibelieve - I then asked Mr Rogers for the 2s he was to give me and he went to Mr Baxter whom I had not known before and got some money of him he then gave me 2s and said he would in the afternoon give me a drop of gin and gave me the 6d to pay the lock-man - I went and got my breakfast and went to work as I had lost a quarter of a day which is 9d I leave it to the Jury to say if I should be guilty of such an error to be torn away from my wife and family as I have been - Rogers was in the same employ with me and he had hired a cart of Mr Dixon to carry bricks to some buildings of his MR DIXON He did request that a man might go and get some old bricks and I told the man to go and do it -Foreman was not at liberty to do any work without asking leave he must have seen my name on the timber Foreman If I had known it had been Mr Dixon s I should certainly have stopped it - I was glad to earn 1s for my wife and family Baxter s Defence Rogers came to me on the 7th of April and asked if I wanted any timber - I said I did but I had bought of Christopher and Son for many years he said I have some timber I obtained from over the water by exchanging laths I knew he was a lath-render - he said he wanted 3l 5s a load and it was good Memel timber I said Where can I see it he said It will be at Rain s wharf to-morrow morning at half-past six o clock I went there and waited till seven and then it came - I went and helped to land it I measured it and there were thirty-four feet - I gave him the price he asked me it came to 2l 2s 6d and 2s carriage - it was taken to Poplar and unloaded in an open yard next to the East India-road I know nothing of the timber except what he told me that he had obtained it by exchanging laths for it FOREMAN -

he lives in Wigmore-street Cavendish-square the prisoner had been in his service I think a year as a cleaner and dyer of feathers - I had given him notice to leave he was to leave about a week before Mr Foster returned On the day he was to leave the 4th of April I asked to search his box which was in the room he slept in to which he agreed - I went with him to the room he went to his box turned different things about and said he was not quite ready for me to see the contents - I waited some time he turned different things over and when I approached the box he said he was not quite ready - he then left the room returned with a purple bag and I believe the bag which was afterwards found I had not then looked into his box when he brought the bag he took it to his box and filled or partly filled it from the box I did not see what he put in - I suspected they were articles belonging to Mr Foster - I went down stairs and went for an officer in my absence the prisoner quitted the room - I had left him in charge of one of the porters I believe he had nothing in his hand then - when I returned he was in the room where the boxes were several persons were there and inquiry was made for a bag which could not be found - the box was then searched some black feathers were found and some pink saucers used for dying - the prisoner was employed as a dyer in a room under that I made inquiries and this bag was brought which contained several white ostrich feathers and a piece of velvet these are the articles - I believe the articles in the bag are the prosecutor s Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q I believe they are difficult to identify A I cannot say that I can swear they are Mr Foster s - the prisoner locked the box when he left the room other persons had access to that room - the prisoner s bed was there I could not identify pink saucers - I have heard the prisoner has said that persons go down to Wapping and purchase feathers of sailors but I do not know it MR BODKIN Q Did any body but the prisoner sleep there A I cannot swear they did not but no one but him usually slept there I should think no one but him could have access to the box CAROLINE FRENCH I am the prosecutor s niece and am employed by him On the day stated I found this blue bag behind a knife-board near the kitchen I had not seen the bag before - it was given to the officer but I did not see it opened FRANCES JOINER I am in the service of Mr Foster On the day in question I saw the prisoner with something in his arms I cannot say what it was - he went across the room I was in and out at a door towards the stairs which leads to the kitchen that was after Mr Duncan went out WILLIAM IRELAND I am an officer I went to take the prisoner - I said to him when he came down What a pity it is for a young man like you to commit yourself in this thieving way and he said there were two or three more in it but he should not say any thing about them this was after I had found this property - I found in the box these black feathers and pink saucers this bottle of perfume these white feathers velvet and flowers were in the bag which Duncan gave me - the prisoner said they were all his own property Cross-examined Q Did you hear him say he was in the habit of going to ships A No JOHN FOSTER I live in Wigmore-street I was absent when this happened it is impossible for me to say that these are my feathers - I had thousands of them the prisoner had the dyeing of them but they should not be in his bed-room we use a great many of these saucers - I cannot swear to these white feathers the last lot I bought of them was three thousand five hundred and I cut some notches on four or five of them with my pen-knife and delivered them to the prisoner to try an experiment this is one of them that I notched - I could not swear to the others I suppose they are worth 3l or 4l COURT Q Was the prisoner employed to dye feathers A Yes they should be kept in the regular place which we call the dye-house till they were dyed he was not to keep any of them in his room - some of these black feathers are not well dyed but they are finished FRANCES JOINER I can swear to these flowers by having made them Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You would scarcely know these from French flowers A Oh yes I know my own work I cannot say but these might have been sold JOSEPHINE VIDET I know these roses I had seen them at Mr Foster s Cross-examined Q These are made in Paris A Yes great numbers of them come to this country - there is no mark on them MR BODKIN Q Whose velvet is that A Mr Foster s I had used some of it - I made these other flowers- it is Genoa velvet there is no private-mark on these flowers - some are made with a machine CHARLES DUNCAN re-examined Q Is this the bag that the prisoner came in with A I believe it is it was like this in appearance colour and size - I left him in the room with it I do not know what he put into it COURT Q Could you not see what he put into it A No I was not close to him and the lid of the box was between us - I did not observe what he put in I did not think he was so bad and thought it might be dirty linen Cross-examined Q Would not these waving feathers have shown A No - I was within three yards of him the box was on a table he was about five minutes filling the bag - there was not any thing to have prevented my making a snatch at the bag and calling for assistance but I did not ANN DAWSON I was servant to the prosecutor - the prisoner gave me this plume of feathers about three months ago Prisoner s Defence I have been respectably brought up in the country - I had made discoveries in dyeing feathers and got a connection I used to buy feathers of sailors and others -

Goddard went in first I followed with four or five more and found laying on the table three coats in an unfinished state one silk waistcoat made up and one surtout not made and six white quilting waistcoats cut out but not made Newland said the coats he had cut out to make up for Robinson s wear and the silk waistcoats also but the quilting waistcoats were for customers of his own - two lengths of drill were also produced with other articles by Newland he said he had them from Robinson - Goddard asked if that was all the property he had got which he had received from Robinson he said it was all he had got Clements said Then if that is all you have got we will look round the room he did so and on taking a candle on a sideboard or shelf on the left-hand side of the room he found this parcel tied up in brown paper - here is the paper there is written on it in Robinson s hand-writing Mr J Robinson I have seen him write many times the parcel contained a yard and a quarter of fancy velvet a yard and a half of figured silk a yard and three-quarters of superfine brown cloth and two pairs of trousers made up I do not think they have been worn - one pair has not been worn certainly Newland said he was not aware of it having been left there - that it must have been left three or four days before he was asked if he had an account with Robinson and said he had been in the habit of making up a good many clothes for him - that he was never paid in money but in goods which answered his purpose equally well he produced no account in my presence - he was asked if he was aware Robinson was in the employ of Messrs East and he said he was perfectly aware of that - he was asked what he owed Robinson and at first said Nothing being again asked he said there was an account between them and he believed he owed him between 30l and 40l which was to be paid at Christmas - several of these articles I can positively swear to I have the piece this velvet was cut from in Court - it matches exactly where the figures is cut through and tallies exactly and this silk I thoroughly believe to be Messrs Easts as we have the exact pattern here are two pattern-cards which we found in Newland s room - they are Messrs Easts and his name ought to be on them that part of the cover which had C and H East on it is cut out Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Had this conversation passed before you found the coats A They were produced to Goddard I believe before I went up -I never heard him say any thing about his believing Robinson to be an agent selling on commission or any thing to that effect he lives at a baker s shop and is a tailor - it is a small room about fourteen feet square I did not see the parcel till Clements took hold of it - Newland s attention had not been directed to it I do not think it had been opened at all - it was not directed to Newland Q When the officer asked if he had more articles whichhe had bought of Robinson did he call his apprentice to look and see if there was more A I did not hear him and think I can swear he did not I never knew an instance of a clerk acting as a commission agent in our trade I have been with Mr East twelve years - Robinson was two years and a half or three years in Mr East s employ and acted as a servant MR PHILLIPS Q Was the sideboard on which the parcel was in the dining-room A Yes there was nothing to prevent the family seeing it - I never knew a clerk allowed to get goods made up and pay the tailor in cloth HENRY GODDARD I am an officer I went with another officer and Landon to the prisoner s house I went up stairs first saw Newland and asked if her knew a young man named Robinson in the employ of Mr East - he said he did I asked how long it was since he had any cloth from him - he said Last week I said his employers had been robbed to a very considerable extent and that I had a search-warrant and it was for him to produce the property he had of Robinson I then asked how much he owed Robinson - he said he did not owe him any for he always took it out in cloth he then went into a back room and brought three unfinished coats and the articles Landon has spoken of - the drill was in the front room he said he was making the coats up for Robinson Clements and Landon then came up stairs - the conversation was in the middle room I asked if he had got any more property which Robinson had brought there - we were then in the front room in which the sideboard was he said No Clements then proceeded to search further and on the sideboard found a small parcel directed to J Robinson - Newland said it must have been left there three or four days ago for he did not know it was there he was again asked if he owed Robinson any thing and said he owed him nothing - we pot him into St James watch-house and on our way to the office next day he said he supposed he owed Robinson 20l or 30l but if he had finished the clothes he supposed he would have owed him 10l Cross-examined Q What time did you go there A About a quarter-past seven o clock in the evening or it might be half-past it was certainly getting towards dark - he at once said he knew Robinson and had bought goods of him the things were brought to us by himself and his apprentice - he went into the back room where they make up clothes the front is a set of dining and a cutting-room and the middle a bed-room - I asked him to produce the whole of the property which he had from Robinson we were then in the front room and he was asked if he had got any thing else Clements took the candle off the front room table and brought the parcel - the parcel was tied up as if it had not been undone the drill laid openly on the cutting-board - the other things were brought out of the back room except the quilted waistcoats which were in the front room his apprentices assisted to produce the things - I particularly asked if it was all the property he had of Robinson MR PHILLIPS Q Did you see the pattern-cards A Yes they were found to the best of my knowledge under the paper parcel on the sideboard THOMAS CLEMENTS I am an officer I went with the officers and found the paper parcel on the sideboard with these two pattern-cards under it and another by the side of it Landon took them up and said Why these are ours I was bringing Newland to the office on the 19th he said he owed Robinson about 20l or it might be rather more that he had been making a suit of clothes for a young man at No 120 Sloane-street named Wilson Scott with cloth brought by Robinson which he took home last Saturday and that would reduce it to about 12l I went there and got the clothes Cross-examined Q Did you go into the room were you found the parcel with a candle A I took a candle off the table in that room HENRY VIGURS EAST I am in partnership with my brother Robinson was our servant we paid him wages as a servant - he was called into the counting-house on the 17th of August and asked where he lived he gave three false addresses - these pattern-cards contain patterns of the goods we had for sale in August and our present stock corresponds with 19-20lbs of them the cards are ours and all the property produced is ours Cross-examined Q Do you deal in the wholesale way A Yes we serve tailors as well as others - we give pattern-cards not sell them August is not the season for giving them we gave several dozens away in April or May - the goods found at Newland s are worth 9l or 10l besides that in the parcel MR PHILLIPS Q When you give any cards do you erase your name from them or is it that the persons may know your stock A Certainly it is - our name is outside and we generally write inside the name of the person we give them to there is no name inside these COURT Q If a person sells on commission for you in what way does he sell A It is a very different description of trade altogether we have a country traveller but never sell on commission - I do not think it is the practice in our trade to sell on commission at all GEORGE ELVIDGE I was porter to the prosecutors five months ago Robinson directed me to take two parcels out for him I left one or two for him at a coffeeshop kept by Arliss in Upper St Martin s-lane tied in brown paper - I think they were directed in the name of James Robinson I also took a parcel to a baker s-shop in Bury-street St James and think it is the house Newland lodged at - I think I took two parcels there Cross-examined Q How came you to leave Messrs East A On account of getting up late in the morning I understood so at the time - I have since heard I was not confident enough I left on the 20th of March - it was about July last year that I went to Bury-street and about February to the coffee-shop - I did not know what the parcels contained CHARLES ARLISS I keep a coffee-shop in Upper St Martin s-lane and have known Robinson about eight months He left a parcel himself with me about eight o clock in the morning directed to Mr Newland and one for Mr Green - I cannot positively say whether Newland himself came for the parcel I was examined at the office - a person called about eleven o clock the same morning and asked for a parcel left for Mr Newland by Robinson it was the prisoner Newland for all I know - I had never seen him before Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q How long agewas it that Robinson left the parcel for Newland A I cannot say I think it was after Christmas five or six months ago - I do not know who fetched it away Newland s Defence written If I had dealt with the prisoner Robinson as a mere acquaintance of yesterday more caution might have been required at my hands but I have known him intimately for several years and known him employed in various situations of great respectability and trust in which no misconduct was ever imputed to him - I knew him to be a sober and an attentive industrious man I was acquainted with some of his relatives and friends who were highly respectable and in a condition as I believed to afford him the means which he stated they had done I have long worked for him as a tailor before he entered the service of the prosecutors and was always told by himself when he solicited orders from me that he was transacting business occassionally on his own account - a circumstance not at all uncommon with persons in his situation In confirmation of all this his prices were as high as those charged by the wholesale traders and I humbly hope you will be satisfied that in crediting these assertions and representations I was doing no more than almost any other man would have done he came openly to my shop and transacted business in the presence of my two apprentices to whom our accounts were always open for inspection - nor was there any thing in the extent of our dealings to awaken suspicion on my part When his conduct was discovered and the prosecutors with the officers came to my house I was ready and anxious to give every explanation - I directed every article to be brought forward and gave up the accounts without hesitation for I had nothing either to conceal or to deny and if I have been in any instance too easily induced to believe in the representations of so very old an acquaintance who as far as I knew had deserved the good character he had enjoyed I trust the character the Court will hear of me to-day from respectable individuals will induce your Lordship and the Jury to believe that I have not done so with any culpable intention of defrauding others but that I have been myself most cruelly deceived ISAAC ACKROYD I live in College-street Chelsea and was formerly in business with Mr Lamot in Marylebone-street Golden-square Robinson is my brother-inlaw and came into our service about six years ago his father died in October 1828 and I believe he had property left him - I cannot tell the amount I do not know any thing about it MR PHILLIPS Q Where did he lodge in August last A On my oath I cannot tell farther than by hear - say - the last place I knew him at was Mr East s and he told me he slept there JOHN COWIE I am a woollen-draper It is customary for drapers to buy goods of agents and the agents may serve on their own account if they please it is frequently the case but not always MR PHILLIPS Q Has it been customary at your house A Yes - I do not give pattern cards like these I am in the wholesale line - I am in the agency business and sell on my own account as well I never give my clerks liberty to have goods made up and pay the tailors with cloth COURT Q Is it customary for a clerk to be a commission agent A No it is not when he is employed as a clerk EDWARD WEST I am apprentice to Newland I have seen Robinson at his house - master has bought articles of him in the usual way of business they were entered in the books - I have seen them entered at the time they were bought Robinson used to enter them and I have seen master enter them - master made up clothes for him I never knew master pay him except by making clothes for him I have heard master complain to him of being over - charged for goods - Robinson has answered that he did not get 2d a yard by them I have heard Robinson tell master at the time that he had bought the goods in the City - I was present when the officers came master and I gathered up the things I was making and took them into the front room - master told me to look for all the things he had had from Robinson I produced all that came from him to the best of my knowledge MR PHILLIPS Q How many dealings had your master with Robinson A I am not aware - I have heard him there a dozen times we never made him more than one coat at a time except the last - there was a great coat and three dress coats they were for Robinson himself and a black coat was made for a gentleman in Sloane-street - I never saw any money pass between Robinson and master I never heard him say where in the City the goods came from - it was the first dealing I was present at that he said he bought them in the City master and mistress used to sit in the front room - I did not go there unless I was wanted I did not know he was in Mr East s employ till be was taken - master s books were given to Mr East on the first examination RICHARD FIGGINS I have been apprentice to Newland these two years - he was in the habit of buying goods of Robinson I have several times heard him complain of their high price and Robinson said he did not get 2d a yard by it - I have heard him say he got the goods in the City but never heard where the purchases were regularly entered into the book at the time - I believe that book is in Mr East s possession MR PHILLIPS Q How long has Robinson dealt with your master A Ever since I have been there I think but I did not know much of master s affairs when I first went he would appear very young two years ago - the first dealing I was present at was about a year and a half since when he has called master has said he wanted goods - I have heard him say It is a pity I did not know it an hour ago as I have just come from the City I have heard that several times - I never heard master ask where he got them I knew he was in Mr East s employ and have heard master say so - Robinson frequently brought cloth to master s he might have brought cloth a dozen or three dozen times Q Will you swear your master has not bought one hundred and fifty yards of cloth of him at different times A I cannot I have seen pattern-cards about but do not know whether these were them - they had not the name scratched out I never noticed what the names were - I seldom went into the front room I believe Robinson went into master s front room whenever he chose - I never saw the parcel on the sideboard I had not been into the room for three days COURT Q Look at these trousers A This pair was made at our house and I believe the others they do not appear to have been worn Q Then in the bundle was a pair of trousers made by your master A I think they are his make - I do not remember when they were made EDWARD WEST These trousers are my make I do not remember when they were made I do not know whether they fitted - they do not appear to have been tried on THOMAS EVANS I am servant to Mr Bedward a man s-mercer in Vigo-lane - I have managed his business for the last seven years and receive all his cash I know Newland perfectly well I have dealt with him as an agent at least he has had goods of me on my own account I bought them of Mr Bedward who is my uncle - I am allowed that privilege they are booked to me and I dispose of them among my friends - I have sold the prisoner goods and have been paid by his making clothes for myself my brother my cousin and Dr Jewell whom I recommended to him MR PHILLIPS Q Your uncle was acquainted with this and you did nothing secretly A Certainly - he knew where I lived I told him I had my uncle s permission COURT Q How were the goods delivered A Sometimes he came to our shop for them and at other times I sent our young man with them ROBINSON -

I did not see him write the card we put the bag upon the man s back - Jolly told him to take it to the Elephant in Fenchurch-street Jolly asked me to lend him 2d which he gave Milner to pay the booking - the next morning which was Sunday Jolly came to my house very early and said he was very sorry that the bag of sugar had got seized he hoped I would say nothing about it and he would never do the like again - the ticket which was on it was similar to this Cross-examined by MR LEE Q I suppose you frequently employ people to carry out parcels A We do not send out many - we have employed people to carry them I was afraid if I divulged it I should lose my place and did not tell my employer of it till the 1st of September which was the day I myself was taken I did not at first know that it was going in a clandestine way -

my attention was particularly directed to it MR ADOLPHUS Q Does your memory enable you to state that Milner brought the parcel in question A Yes and I remember booking it and Woolford taking it away- Milner had frequently been in our house WILLIAM ELLIS I am in the employ of Mr Woolford the carrier On Saturday the 27th of August I received a parcel from the Elephant for Mr Clarke of Poplar Mr Woolford was with me and I was inside the cart - we went home and put the cart into master s yard I took the parcel to Mr Clarke s - he opened the door to me I said I have a bag for you he said it was all right and paid me 1s - his is a private house not a shop Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q So he keeps no shop A No - the words Tea-dealer are over his door I only went into the passage - there is another Mr Clarke almost opposite I never stated that I did not receive the parcel till I got to the Red Lion - I said I removed them from one cart to another there Clarke did not open the parcel before he said it was all right it was night when I took it there - the officer followed me to Mr Clarke s with the parcel and directly I had put it in the passage and received the carriage-money he seized the parcel and Clarke I then went away MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you know the officer was following you A Not till I got to the house ROBERT HOWARD I am an officer In consequence of information I followed the cart I saw Ellis put the cart into Woolford s yard - I followed him with this bag to Clarke s house Cotton-street Poplar Clarke opened the door received the parcel and said It is all right Ellis said there was 1s to pay - I did not see Clarke give it I directly went in and asked Clarke to show me the bill of parcels or tell me where the bag came from -

Mr Alderman Cowan he appeared again on the Wednesday and bail was again extended till Milner was brought forward JAMES SHORTLAND I am a porter I was at the Elephant when Milner brought the bag I assisted to take it off his back and take it to the Elephant - I went with Howard the same night and saw the same parcel at Clarke s at Poplar when Clarke had paid for it Howard went in and took him into custody - he said he was very willing to go I took this direction off the bag in Howard s presence and gave it to him on the Monday Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did not Howard seize Clarke directly the shilling was paid A He went in and told him he must take him - he allowed him to walk into the room and speak to his wife I saw Ellis deliver the parcel but I cannot say Clarke touched it ROBERT HOWARD I kept the direction in my possession for two or three days and then gave it to Mr Sherman PHILLIP CORNMAN This is a similar bag to that which went from the warehouse but I cannot swear it is the same- I saw no mark on it and did not particularly notice it MR EDWARD BEDWELL KEMBLE I have one partner only Jolly was in our employ and I know his handwriting I have not a doubt this direction is in his writing- Jolly was our porter and Cornman was under him Jolly s Defence I should not have been charged with this if it had not been for Cornman I knew nothing of it but when Cornman was accused of it he accused me to get off himself Clarke s Defence I know nothing whatever of this parcel I expected a parcel of coffee that evening -

Hodge was my servant for about three years he quitted me on Friday the 11th of November Roberts was in my service about six months and she had left about a week before On the 18th of November a Police-serjeant called on me and from what he said I requested Hodge to show him two small silver ladles - he went down stairs with the officer as I supposed to produce them in a few minutes I heard a scuffle on the stairs which was occasioned by the officer bringing up the two prisoners to my room - Roberts happened to be at the house that night and when I went in she told me she had come to assist my landlady when the officer had brought them up I told Hodge what I had heard and requested him to tell me the exact extent to which he had robbed me and that in proportion as he informed me of the loss of my property so I would deal with him - I have seen a number of my articles produced by the pawnbrokers THOMAS JOSEPH WEST I am a Police-serjeant In consequence of information I went to Mr Bunn s on the 18th of November and made a communication to him he desired Hodge to produce some ladles to me and I went down stairs with him - he felt in his pockets and said Dear me what have I done with them he went towards the area I said They are not in the house - he said No they are not I then took him up stairs we met Roberts on the stairs - he said to her You have brought me to this she said You are as bad as I am so I took them both to the station-house - Hodge told me where he lodged I went there and they directed me to the garret where I found thirty-four duplicates in a bottle - I asked Roberts where she lived and she said at No 9 Norton-street and I should find her sister there I went and found her sister I found six duplicates in a teacaddy and one of them was for these six cups and saucers and two glasses EDWARD FITCHEW I am assistant to William Fitchew a pawnbroker These shoes this tea-spoon this tablespoon and these fire-irons were pawned by Hodge and this salt-spoon pair of boots and silver pen by Roberts - between the 12th of August and the 14th of November Cross-examined by MR LEE Q Where are the duplicates of the articles pawned by Hodge A These are them I knew him before I am quite sure I received these articles from the prisoners I knew Roberts before and am quite sure she pawned these articles - all the duplicates are my writing sometimes one of the prisoners has brought the same article which had before been pawned and redeemed by the other BENJAMIN TIMMS I am a shopman to Mr Harrison of Tottenham-court-road a pawnbroker I have some coffee-cups pawned by Roberts on the 11th of August I am sure it was her - I have the counterpart of this duplicate Cross-examined Q Is the duplicate in your handwriting A Yes I had not seen her before but I swear to her person GEORGE NORMAN I am a shopman to a pawnbroker in Norfolk-street I have a butter-knife a fork and several other articles but they were not pawned by either of the prisoners JOHN MILTON I am an apprentice to a pawnbroker in Berwick-street I have a tea-pot pawned on the 2nd of August and a cloak on the 5th of August by Hodge MR BUNN I believe Roberts came into my service on the 3rd of February I had not missed any of these articles till the prisoners were taken I cannot say when I lost them - when I had discharged Roberts I commissioned Hodge to examine if my things were all right and he said they were that was about a week before he was taken - these cups and other things are mine Cross-examined Q Do you recollect using the teapot A I do not think I ever did use it there is no crest or arms on these coffee-cups but they correspond with the pattern of a set I purchased - here is my crest and name on this salt-spoon and the other articles I know by having similar ones I had the management of the Dublin theatre Hodge was at that time in my service and he then had 1l a week - I knew he was married and had a family when I came to England I paid him 10s a week the 1l a week was not continued - I am not in debt to him for wages - I told him I could not give him the same as I had at the theatre I cannot say that I fixed any sum with him but to the best of my belief I told him his wages would be 10s a week - there is something due to his wife for washing which has been witheld merely because my things were not returned and there may be something due to her as a dresser at the theatre Hodge did not sleep at my house - Roberts was not accustomed to pay for mangling and other things for me I never left her without money to pay current expences I was never absent for any length of time but when I went to France for five weeks - I left some money with her then but only enough for a few days I do not know that she then pawned some articles to pay expences for when I found my stay in France was protracted I wrote to my solicitor to supply her which he did - I found some letters had come while I was away COURT Q From the time you returned from France did either of the prisoners make any communication to you on that subject A No Hodge did ask for some advance to his pay and I got his wife a situation as dresser in a theatre I have found my stock is deficient of six cups and saucers THOMAS JOSEPH WEST This duplicate for the salt spoon this for the pen and the boots were found at Hodge s lodging but were pawned by Roberts Roberts All I pawned was the boots and the coffeecup EDWARD FITCHEW I am confident she pawned the spoon and the pen - she has pawned other things I know her particularly by an impediment in her speech HODGE - GUILTY Aged 28 ROBERTS - GUILTY Aged 24 Transported for Seven Years

I and my son watched and a little after one o clock I heard a person get over the fence from the prisoner s premises he then went to a door immediately opposite to where I laid in ambush and lifted it off the hinges - he then went to another door and broke it with the bolt which he took from the first door I had fastened it with a staple and chain - he crept through an aperturein the feather-edge boarding and opened another door I heard all this distinctly - he then went up the ladder to the granary door and broke the lock off with the bolt - he left the bolt on the weighing-machine and the lock and staple very near it some time elapsed and I thought the person had gone to take some more hay as I had lost some - I went to the door he had first opened or my son did and we found the door closed against us which prevented our following him that way - my son said he thought he was a long while we looked and saw a man going across the lair with a sack on his back - I saw him go to the foot of a ladder placed against the wall between the prisoner s premises and mine the prisoner s barn is there and there is a trap-door on the parapet wall coming into my premises - my son called out and said There he is father he threw down the sack and fell down or got down and ran as fast as he could across my meadow - the ladder was son placed as to afford a communication with the trap-door the sack which contained beans remained at the foot of the ladder till one of the Police-officers assisted my son to take it back to my granary - I opened the sack in about ten minutes it contained a hundred and a half of beans and I had my beans in the granary which the person went up and forced the door of I looked into my granary as soon as we took the sack back and found half a quarter of beans gone Cross-examined by MR LEE Q Do you keep cows A I did I have only one now which I keep for my own purpose - I did not take the person at first as I wished to take him with the property I was about ten yards from him when he opened the second door - it was dark I knew him he has worked for me seven or eight months -I have no doubt that it was him but I could not exactly see his face I said to the best of my knowledge the prisoner was the person - he had not left my service he kept cows and sold milk himself - I do not know that he was about leaving me WILLIAM MARTIN JUN I am the prosecutor s son - what he has stated is correct JAMES HOPKINS I am a Police-officer I know the prisoner - I saw him on the morning of the 11th of November between two and half-past two o clock crossing from the field belonging to Mr Marchant - he crossed the East and West India-road and went down the street to his own dwelling in Brick-street he went in without knocking - in about a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw him come out again and go towards his own barn I am quite sure it was him - I had known him before going out with milk COURT Q Is the field you saw him come from the same that has been described by the prosecutor A Yes Cross-examined Q And is not that the direct road from his barn to his own house A No -

they were very wet and had grass which was very wet and green on them I tried the boots to the track leading from the back door of Mr Marchant s barn to the trap-door against which the ladder was standing one of the boots is full of hob-nails and clinkers and the inside edge of the right boot has not any - the boots exactly corresponded with the marks in the track- I believe from my observation that the impressions I saw were made by these boots I did not see any impression in the grass field - I took the prisoner from the serjeant he told me his wife had been ill for some time and he had slept in the back room with the children Cross-examined Q Was it extraordinary for a cowkeeper to have wet boots A They would not have been wet if he had not been in a wet place I did not look for any marks on the other side of the premises -

I went to the prisoner s barn and found it locked I saw a lad who generally assists the prisoner and when I got into his barn I found five trusses of clover-hay bound up and one loose I did not go to the prisoner s house - I took him in his barn it was locked when I went to search the premises but it was open when I took him he had a pair of low shoes on which appeared not to have been worn for a long time he complained of them and cut them THOMAS STANLEY I am a labourer On the 10th of November I was going for five quarters of oats we were short of sacks and my master borrowed half a dozen sacks of Mr Hooper and one of the prisoner I had three sacks of our own -

t18320216-176  682 JAMES ISEABY SAMUEL GARRAD and THOMAS SPARKS were indicted for stealing on the 11th of February 16 bushels of oats value 2l 8s and 2 bushels of chaff value 1s the goods of Henry Gray their master MR BODKIN conducted the prosecution HENRY GRAY I am a livery-stable keeper - my premises are in Earl-street Blackfriars Iseaby was my head ostler and has been so since March 1830 he has been in my employ eight or nine years On the 10th of February in consequence of some suspicion I made arrangements to watch on the premises at night my premises are entered at a gateway - on the left side of the ride is my house door and on the opposite side are stables numbered 1 to 5 they then turn a corner and there are Nos 6 and 7 - a large coach-house and then No 8 which is close to the dung-hill - the granary is over stable No 3 on the right-hand and the door is nearly opposite my house door a room is built over the ride from the side of my house and joins stables Nos 2 and 3 - there is a window at each end of that room one looking towards the gate and the other to the back part of the ride I stationed Unwin one of my post-boys in that room - the prisoner Sparks was in the employ of a person who took away my dung Garrad had also been in that person s employ - the usual time to come for the dung was six o clock in the morning on the morning in question about twenty minutes to four Unwin made a communication to me and I went on the roof near a sky-light where I could see the granary - Unwin went out of the bed-room window on to No 5 stable he could see the back part of the yard - the first thing which attracted my notice was a small glare of light from the sky-light which I presume was a candle being lighted by a gas-light which was near but not in view I then observed a man pass under the sky-light from the direction of the lamp to No 3 stable - I did not perceive any thing in his hand from the external appearance I believe it to be Iseaby - he had no light the next thing attracting my attention was lights appearing through the granary - this was in a very few minutes we have a number of pantile lights made of iron and a pane of glass - I observed a number of these burning they are used to light the granary - about half-past four o clock the bell rang very loud and was not answered it was rang again and then the lights were extinguished and the person was let in -I found it was Montague he went up the yard towards his place of business and I observed somebody come back again down the yard obtain a light and go up to the stable again in the same direction - at three quarters past five o clock the horse and cart were brought down the yard and the cart placed towards No 3 - I had seen that cart when I was first alarmed just under the room where Unwin was watching it was backed a little towards No 3 - I observed a full sack cast into the cart Sparks took it up and placed it towards the body of the cart - I called Unwin a person in a red night-cap immediately pitched up some dung or litter into the cart which Sparks threw over the sack - four sacks were passed into the cart I could not see who the person was that put them in - Sparks was in the cart Unwin and I immediately passed through the house - I sent him for an officer I opened the gate and let him and the officers in- they went up the ride to where the cart stood I found Sparks on the cart Garrad behind it and Iseaby came out of the door of No 3 stable which has a loft over it - that is on the same floor as the granary the granary is separated from the other parts of the loft by an inclosure - the stable No 3 does not go directly into the granary the prisoners were then taken into custody - it was Iseaby s duty to lock up the granary every night and deposit the keys in a desk in my office then to lock the office and to bring to my house the key of the office I went up into the granary and found the door open and the key in the lock - I know it was the regular key there was a small quantity of oats in the granary - I am satisfied the oats had been moved from the granary to the cart I have samples of both the bulk and that in the cart - I have no doubt of them Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q It was the duty of the dung contractor to come at six o clock A Yes - it appears they have been in the habit of coming at all hours in the night but not with my knowledge I knew it by information but did not approve of it - I had Unwin in my sight all the time he was on the roof I told the Magistrate I believed from the outward appearance that it was Iseaby who came from the gas-light - I do not recollect telling the Magistrate I did not know who it was he was dressed - he appeared to have drab coloured clothes on but I do not swear that he had no hat on but something in the shape of a cap - he had no smock-frock I thought it was a cloth coat but at that distance I cannot positively swear what description of coat but swear he had a coat I could not tell what the materials were - I have not sworn he had no coat on if I have said I could not tell whether he had or not I did not mean to say so - Iseaby knew Montague perfectly well he was coming in to go to his business - he had come in late the night before and had orders which required him to come early that morning if Iseaby did not know that he ought to - I should think he must have known Montague was on the premises I saw French up the yard Sparks got off the cart when the bell rang and French passed the cart - Sparks then got into it again the granary was over No 3 and the bean granary over No 1 - whether Iseaby has invariably brought the granary keys to the office at night I cannot state but it was his bounden duty to do so my strict orders were that it should be done - it was never omitted to my knowledge the key of the office was brought that night - he had the care of the office and it was his duty to put the key of the granary there there was no specific hour to lock the office - it might be done at six or seven o clock the keys were generally put there about my tea time - it was his duty to take care of both granaries alike we call him head ostler - it is aplace of confidence I left him in charge during my absence Q Had you the slightest reason to find fault with him A I had a bridle was lost out of the stable three or four years ago or it might be longer - I have no memorandum of it I have frequently complained of his getting drunk within the last twelve months Q Why not discharge him A The truth is he was my customer s servant and not mine for he had a good hold of them Cross-examined by MR HEATON Q Who is the person that takes your dung A Mercer - I believe Garrad has been many years in his employ Montague and French were at their regular employ while the cart was being loaded I was certainly surprised to see this done after Montague came in - Isenby knew the dung was not to be fetched before six o clock - I never told Garrad so MR BODKIN Q What duty would devolve on Montague and French A To feed their horses and clean their harness to go out about eight o clock - they generally clean their horses inside the stable No 8 which is the further stable round the corner out of the ride - they would have no view of the granary Montague was more likely to have come at eight o clock than at that time Q Is there any proper purpose for which the cart could have been opposite stable No 3 A It would have been their business to have been there to take the dung from the door but not to turn the tail of the cart to the door SAMUEL UNWIN I am in Mr Gray s service and have been so for seven years On the 10th of February by his desire I sat up to watch in the room over the gateway - about twenty minutes past four o clock my attention was attracted by the dung-cart stopping at the gate and in a moment I heard a very gentle ring indeed at the gate I was so much awake that I heard the cart stop before the bell rang - I saw Iseaby go and open the gate the cart came in - Sparks and Garrad were in it Iseaby had the charge of the gate that night - the cart was backed up the yard towards the counting-house and round the corner by No 6 towards the dung-hill I went and met master coming down stairs - I went through the house and got on the roof to a side window which commanded a view of the dung-heap I saw Sparks and Garrad place a ladder which we use to light the gas with they placed it against the loft over No 6 - master at that time was standing near a sky-light against No 3 loft I could see him but it was rather dark - I saw Sparks and Garrad ascend the ladder into the loft with a candle and the moment they entered Mr Gray called to me that there was a light in the loft I said I know it Sir - hold your tongue the ladder was then removed and in a moment after I saw Garrad walking up the yard towards the dung-hill he had come down the ladder and taken it away - he was on the ground against No 6 I had not seen how he came down - I then saw Garrad back the cart up to the dung-hill and could see him throwing dung up into the cart about half-past four o clock the bell rang twice the second time was rather violent - I could not see who answered it nor see the gate where I was Montague came in and went up to the top stable No 8 - the cart being in the way I could not see him go into the stable but that was his place after that I saw Garrad bring the cart down from No 6 to opposite No 3 before the loft window - master then called me to him I saw sacks put into the cart - I could not see by whom I was then sent for an officer - I went through the house and fetched one Cross-examined by MR HEATON Q Is Garrad a married man A I have heard so Montague must have gone by the cart to get to his stable - Garrad was Spark s assistant LYDIA JOHNSON I am in Mr Gray s service On Friday night the 11th of February between nine and ten o clock Iseaby brought me the key of the counting-house SAMUEL DOWDNEY I am an officer I took the prisoners in charge here is a sample of the corn taken out of the cart MR GRAY I have a sample from the bulk which I have compared with that in the cart they correspond WILLIAM MONTAGUE I was in Mr Gray s service I came on Saturday morning as the watchman was calling half-past four o clock Iseaby opened the gate - I asked him for a light he said the dung-men had got it up the yard - I went to the dung-men and they had no light the gas gave a very fair light on the dung-hill sufficient to take the dung away - I went into No 8 stable Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Iseaby had no notice at what time you would come A Not at all I rang twice he slept in No 2 the bell does not go into that stable but hangs a very little way off the dung men had no light at the heap whether they had it else - where I do not know Cross-examined by MR HEATON Q Have you been there so early on other mornings A I do not recollect that I have they did not seem surprised at my coming COURT Q You were unusually early A Yes my time of coming was very uncertain six men took it by turns to sit up when any of us are out they have to answer the bell when I am ordered out early in the morning I am obliged to get there early the man who sits up usually gives me a candle to get a light from the lantern which hangs in No 2 when the dung-men said they had no light I went back to get one the bell did not ring so loud as usual the first time though I pulled it as usual - I have found the dung-men there early before - I do not recollect having been sent to them before for a light WILLIAM FRENCH I was in Mr Gray s service I came at a quarter to five o clock Sparks opened the gate to me it was Iseaby s duty to open it - I went to No 8 where my business was I asked for a light Garrad said There is one up there he stood by the side of the cart which was opposite the granary - I saw nobody else by the cart - I did not see anybody else by the cart - I saw no light till I got to No 8 and Montague had one there I afterwards went to unload the dung-cart there were four sacks of corn and two bushels of chaff two in the front of the cart with two nose-bags and two behind with the chaff and straw over them Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When Sparks opened the gate you asked for a light A No I went up the yard and asked him for a light - Garrad said there was one up the yard - I did not go into No 2stable there was a light there Iseaby slept there and should keep a light I might have gone there if I chose I saw Iseaby up the yard about half-past-five o clock - he was dressed - he usually got up at six o clock - he came round the corner as if from No 2 or he might come from No 3 Cross-examined by MR HEATON Q How far was the cart from the dung-hill A Twenty or thirty yards the dung-hill is round the corner Garrad did not attempt to conceal himself from me MR BODKIN Q Did you ask what the light was in No 2 A No I saw it through the window there is usually a lamp there MR GRAY The corn was put into the cart at three-quarters past four o clock Iseaby was the only person who ought to have been on the premises at that time - I did not expect the glass-coachmen so early but they afterwards satisfied me it was necessary for them to be there so early or they could not have got ready having to clean their coaches Iseaby had the entire charge of the premises that night Iseaby s Defence I let Montague in and when the bell rang I came as far as the door of No 2 and saw Sparks he let French in - I then retired to my bed and went to sleep till I heard master sing out Wells - I then rose and ran into No 3 thinking the noise came from there - I then proceeded round the corner Dowdney came in it was customary for the men to feed their horses as they pleased Mr Gray took no account of the corn and sometimes the horses would have none if I locked the granary when I was gone home if the men come early as six o clock was my time the corn was often taken down above an hour after I got home ISEABY -

I said No he then asked me if there was any more goods coming down to be entered I said I believe a small parcel was coming down after tea he went down stairs - I met Nicholson coming from his tea and told him he told my brother of it I was sent up to tea and left it to them to watch The prisoner went up to his tea I could not see how many black silk stocks there were an officer was sent for who took him - he had no business in the upper warehouse at all Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q What do you call these stocks A Opera ties the top warehouse is the store-warehouse for haberdashery - he had no business there nor in the other warehouse his business was on the ground floor at his desk where goods are called over to him by the entering-clerk - I met him coming up a second time as I was going down he was not in the habit of inquiring if more goods were coming down - he frequently came into that warehouse while the young men were at tea and sometimes he had business there he has been in the employ three or four months - I have been there six goods are brought down to the ground floor in baskets to be packed - we carry them down the entering-clerk has sometimes come up and taken a thing down in his hand Mr Sawer is the entering-clerk - the prisoner is the clerk to write the invoices another clerk books them MR CLARKSON Q How many are there in your employ A Between twenty and thirty - the prisoner had a particular seat in the warehouse and had no business to leave it WILLIAM WICKENS I am the brother of James Wickens It is my duty to mark the black stocks among other things- they were kept at the end of the counter in the warehouse on the first floor the prisoner was employed on the ground floor near the door - he had no business with the stocks in the upper warehouse I know there ought to have been five dozen and a half of stocks in the place - I received information counted them and half a dozen were gone and were found under his desk - they had no business there they appeared to have been rolled up - I did not touch them but fetched the officer they were worth 9s 6d - half a piece of ribbon measuring eighteen yards was found with the stocks that was kept in a drawer in the first floor warehouse - the prisoner could have no business with that the sales were bought from our warehouse and entered by him nobody could have any business to deposit these articles under his desk - the ribbon drawer was directly under where the stocks were it could easily be taken for we generally have the drawer open on the counter Cross-examined Q Where were these stocks kept A On the counter tied in half dozens - the prisoner s only duty was to make invoices another clerk entered the goods - we have about six clerks he had no business to touch the goods - a person called a giver in calls over the goods while one enters them and another writes the invoice at the same time - these goods were found under his desk they were not covered but were behind a box which he puts his feet upon - we had to move it before we saw them - I counted the stocks when my brother gave me information and know six were missing MR CLARKSON Q Had the prisoner any thing to do with handling the goods A No my brother was placed behind the door in consequence of suspicion MR ROBERT WALLS STEPHENS I am a partner in the firm of Messrs Rawson and others The prisoner was in our service - his occupation was to make out invoices under the desk of the person who enters them the entering counteris directly opposite the desk - the giver in comes there and calls the goods over - that is the regular system of business the prisoner had nothing whatever to do with meddling with the articles of trade - we began to miss goods shortly after he came to our employ I have seen the stocks - they are our property Cross-examined Q I suppose he has been up in your warehouse while in your employ A I have seen him there several times - he had no business there but having no suspicion at that time I did not rebuke him his duty could not lead him there - he might have gone to talk to the people there WILLIAM HENMAN I am an officer I was sent for to the prosecutors house and took the prisoner - I sent for him up into the private room and charged him with stealing six silk neckerchiefs and a piece of ribbon he denied it - I searched him and found nothing - while searching him William Wickens came to me and from what he said I went down stairs to the prisoner s desk and there saw under the desk a box and behind that six silk stocks and a piece of ribbon Wickens was alongside of me - they had a tape with a mark on it and Wickens claimed them I went up stairs and told the prisoner I had found them - he denied the charge GUILTY Aged 40 534 JAMES LAMB was again indicted for stealing on the 28th of January 3 pairs of silk stockings 21s 144 other stockings value 6l 2s 131 socks value 1l 10s 6d 16 cuffs value 5s 20 gloves value 17s 1 pair of shoes value 3s 6d 2 frock bodies value 2s 6d 248 yards of lace value 3l 2s 2 table-covers value 20s 6 hankerchiefs value 15s 2 under-waistcoats value 15s 6 hair braces value 5s 6d 1lb of cotton thread value 2s 1 hare-skin value 2s 6 cravats value 12s 36 yards of braid value 5s 136 yards of ribbon value 8s 6d 52 pieces of tape value 13s 12 purses value 13s 10 gross of shirt buttons value 1l 10s 23 reels of cotton value 2s 8 gaiters value 3s 1 belt value 6d 30 papers of needles value 2s 6d 36 yards of galloon value 1s 6d 12 stay laces value 1s 6d 1 boa value 10d 1 piece of braiding value 9d 1 yard of net value 3s 4 cap-crowns value 2s 10 yards of quilling value 5s 3 bracelets value 1s 6d 1 pair of drawers value 2s and 1 Angola shirt value 3s 6d the goods of Edward Rawson and others his masters WILLIAM HENMAN After taking the prisoner in custody I went to search his lodgings No 11 Prince s-street Bedford-row he told me he lodged there - I got there a little after eight o clock and took possession of a great quantity of property - William Wickens was with me and pointed out what he thought belonged to the prosecutors here are about twenty-two pairs of silk stockings and a quantity of cotton stockings in all about seventy pairs of stockings of both descriptions quite new a great quantity of lace upwards of two hundred yards and a gross of shirt buttons - I found some things concealed in boxes under the bed some in baskets and some in another place he occupied three rooms on the second floor - I found a duplicate of stockings pawned with King Cross-examined Q He told you without hesitation where he lived A Yes his wife was out but on her return she gave me every facility in searching and said she always told her husband not to bring things home but he told her he had bought them as jobs I never heard of his being in business for himself - I found other things there claimed by other people in whose employ he had been and there was table-linen and other things in wear in the same boxes the lace was concealed at the bottom of a box of trinkets and a paper carefully laid over it so that it appeared the bottom of the box - you would not suspect any thing was under it HENRY RICHARDSON I am servant to William King a pawnbroker No 34 High Holborn - the prisoner occasionally came to the shop On the 22nd of October he pawned with me three pairs of black silk stockings for 10s in the name of John Long No 16 Brownlow-street this is the duplicate I gave him - they appeared new stockings Cross-examined Q Is it not common to pawn in a false name A I believe it is MR ROBERT WALLS STEPHENS I am one of the firm of Edward Rawson and Co we had missed several things I have looked at these stockings - they are the manufacture of Mr Gibbon whose son is a partner in our firm and they have my hand-writing on the paper - I can swear to them I have looked at the different articles and believe them to belong to us - I could swear to the greater part of them and some corresponding with our stock I believe to be ours - there are about ten gross of shirt-buttons Cross-examined Q Have you any doubt but the property must have been taken at different times A It must have been taken at several times - we had missed stockings but not black ones our stock is so large and so many goods lay about the counter - Mr Gibbon does not make entirely for us but these are a particular description of stockings which had been re-dyed and were in three pair parcels we should sell them with the mark on but then there would be the entering mark in addition MR CLARKSON Q If you sold the whole parcel the paper would go with them A Yes we never sold the prisoner any goods and never had an idea of his dealing in such things or I should not have employed him EDWARD BENJAMIN LEEFE I am in the service of the prosecutors as warehouseman Among these articles I see a pair of worsted shoes which have my mark and are my masters property - I never sold them to the prisoner they are worth 3s 10d MR RICHARD BEESTON I am one of the firm - here is a table-cover among these articles I believe to be our property when it was produced I could not swear to it -

t18330817-29  1181 JAMES WARREN and EDWARD RAINSFORD was indicted for stealing on the 29th of June 4 lbs of tobacco value 14s the goods of John Rogers the master of the said James Warren See Sixth Sess p 626 MR CLARKSON conducted the prosecution GEORGE ROGERS I am the son of the prosecutor John Rogers he is a tobacconist and lives at No 392 Oxford-street - Warren had been in his employ nearly three years and he was so in June last - we have a servant named Patrick Crawley - on the 28th of June my father left London he had given me some information and I spoke to Crawley - our usual time of dinner was three o clock but we were generally a little later - on the 29th of June I altered the dinner hour to two o clock and about two o clock I sent Warren to the Old Change with 60 lbs weight of tobacco - while he was gone I searched the shop and under the counter I found in a box three parcels of tobacco containing about 2 lbs each two of them were tied up and the other merely rolled up and tucked in at the ends that was not a proper place for it to be kept - it is customary in our trade to have an order from the Excise for the delivery of all goods above the weight of 1 lb these orders are brought to the counting-house but no orders had been brought for the delivery of these parcels to my knowledge on finding these parcels I called for Crawley and Brown and showed them to them - Warren returned from the City in about an hour and ten minutes - on his return I left the shop with Mr Brealey who had come in and to whom I had shown the tobacco we crossed the road and stood where we could see the shop - I then saw Rainsford whom I had not known before come near the shop lingering about with a blue bag in his hand with something in the bottom of it - he went into the shop after some time and came out in two or three minutes with the bag much fuller than it had been before - we crossed over to him and I asked what he had in his bag he said some tobacco I asked if he would allow me to see it he said certainly we went back to our shop and I took from the bag two of the parcels which had been in the box under the counter - Warren was behind the counter at the time - I then looked into the box and there was only one of the parcels left in it I asked Rainsford how he came by the tobacco which was in his bag he said it was his father s stock who keeps a little tobacconist s and he had brought it out to sell he wrote this direction E Rainsford 16 Cumberland-row King s-cross I noticed the manner of his writing I asked him if he came out to sell the tobacco how he came to bring it into our shop he said he came in to buy some snuff - he was asked what he gave for the snuff both he and Warren answered together Warren said he had given two-pence and Rainsford said he had given a penny - I asked Warren if he knew anything about the tobacco he said No nothing at all - he had not turned his back upon Rainsford the whole time he had been in the shop - no man of the size of Rainsford could have reached over the counter and helped himself to the tobacco in the box there was no invoice with the tobacco under the counter which is usually given to those who do not pay Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Rainsford never said he got the tobacco out of the box A No he said he had tobacco in his bag and he gave his right direction where his father lives - I do not know whether he has any interest in his father s business this box was not the place where tobacco is usually kept and there was no invoice or permit with it - it was cut tobacco which is kept in casks in the shop I have no doubt it had been placed in the box by Warren another person might have placed it there but he must have given it over the counter - our lads in the shop go behind the counter the same as Warren but the lads had been out for an hour or two before I found the tobacco I cannot say how long it had been in the box - Warren had been the only person there for some time MR CLARKSON Q Do you know the description of tobacco usually smuggled into this country A Not of my own knowledge but I have heard it is of a rank description but this is manufactured in our own factory COURT Q How do you know that - have you any particular mode of dressing it in your factory No I believe all manufactures do it in a similar way but this was English manufacture Warren Q Can you swear to that tobacco as your father s A Yes I will swear to it by its corresponding with our other tobacco and being tied up in our usual manner - here is the writing of one of our lads on one of these parcels which was in the box and afterwards taken from Rainsford this is exactly the same description andappearances as ours and there are hardly any two manufacturers that I have seen but what there is a difference COURT Q Warren had access to your father s tobacco but he was not employed to purchase any A No certainly not PATRICK CRAWLEY I am in the service of Mr Rogers I have seen Rainsford frequently come to the shop in my master s absence he generally came from three to four o clock while my master was at dinner - I made a communication to my master - on the 29th of June I was called with Brown to see three parcels of tobacco which were in a box under the counter one of them was marked F Shag I suppose in one of the lads writing - when Warren returned home that day my master went out - I then saw Rainsford outside the shop I went back into the snuff-room which is parted off from the warehouse - Brown cried out Here he is - I then saw Rainsford in the shop on the customers side of the counter - I could not see the inside of the counter from where I was but it appeared as if Rainsford was talking to some one - I then saw him go out and Mr Rogers and Mr Brealy brought him back Cross-examined Q Had you been at home all the morning A Yes and so had Brown - the cut tobacco is kept in casks I had not placed any tobacco in the box - F Shag means fine shag it is all cut tobacco COURT Q What description of tobacco was that in the parcel A One was fine shag and the other was returns it appeared to me the same as that which is manufactured on our premises Warren Q Have you seen any other manufacture like Mr Rogers A Yes they are nearly the same in my opinion - I did not see you place any tobacco in the box nor take any out I could not see what was done inside the counter WILLIAM BROWN I am servant to Mr Rogers On the 29th of June I was called to see the tobacco under the counter - I had seen Rainsford come to the house between three and four o clock which was the dinner hour in general and he came at that time on that day - I saw him go to the counter and Warren was behind the counter at the time COURT Q Did you see Warren standing at that part of the counter under which the three parcels were A Yes exactly at that part within reach of the box - there was no one else behind the counter JOHN HARVEY police-constable E 48 I took the two prisoners and have the tobacco - I asked Warren if he knew anything about the tobacco he said no WILLIAM PLUME police-serjeant C 12 I searched Warren s person and found on him this letter GEORGE ROGERS I believe this letter to be the handwriting of Rainsford from what I saw him write Cross-examined Q Is it by comparing this letter with the direction that you say that A Yes and from its being found on Warren s person I never saw him write before nor since COURT Q Did you notice the character of his handwriting when you saw him with the pen in his hand A Yes and from having observed the character of his hand-writing I can form an opinion of the letter and taking all things into consideration and considering the agitation he must have been in there is still a great similarity Q But if you had seen the letter any where else should you have thought so A It depends on the time that elapsed after I had seen the direction MR CLARKSON Q But if you had recollected what you had seen of the direction should you have thought so A Yes Letter read Dear Warren - Let me have ready at half-past three tomorrow without fail 1lbs shag and 2lbs returns positively and if you can at the same time 4lbs shag or 3lbs shag and 1lb returns likewise I owe you to day 1s 6d Thursday 5s and Saturday last 5s for cigars which I will give you the next time I see you let me likewise have on Monday next without fail 3lbs shag and 1lb returns in haste E R Friday evening six o clock To Mr Warren John-street Tottenham-court-road WILLIAM PLUME Q I searched Warren s lodging at No 94 John-street Tottenham-court-road I there found this other letter GEORGE ROGERS I believe this to be Rainsford s writing read Dear Sir - As I shall leave home this evening to convey my mother from the country to-morrow it will be useless your coming down here to-morrow morning as originally proposed as I shall be from home but if you can make it convenient to call here to-morrow evening after half-past eleven the old man will have left and we can then come to a settlement or if more convenient will meet you on Monday or Tuesday after half-past eleven in the evening at any place you may appoint with kind respects to Rakeman Your well-wisher RAINSFORD To Mr Warren 94 John-street Tottenham-court-road GEORGE ROGERS re-examined Q Did you know Warren s residence A Yes it was at No 94 John-street Tottenham-court-road Warren s Defence The tobacco found in the box was my property I had bought it of a smuggler they say that it is impossible to smuggle tobacco of English manufacture now the tobacco that is smuggled into London comes from Liverpool and Bristol and is manufactured in England and taken out again to get the drawback allowed Rainsford s Defence For the first time in my life I am araigned at this bar on a serious charge of felony which if substantiated must deprive me of that which is most sacred to every Englishman the privilege of liberty I trust therefore you will bear with me while I submit my defence to your calm deliberation having in my connexion in business become acquainted with Warren who stated that he had some smuggled tobacco I was in the habit of leaving orders for some at his lodging and on the evening previous to this I left an order for a quantity to be ready the following day I called for it and having paid him the money for it I came out and was stopped by Mr Rogers who asked what I had got I said tobacco he asked if I had any objection to his inspecting it I said no he then took me back to the shop and swore to it as his father s tobacco I ask you whether I could have been so blind to my own interest as to go in broad day light into the shop exposed to the view of Mr Rogers and every one in his employ would it not naturally have been inferred that I should have chosen the evening andtaken the most cautious steps but I knew I had nothing to fear and therefore I hesitated not to go to the premises now Mr Rogers states that he can swear to the goods by the writing on one of the parcels which he has failed to prove to be the hand writing of himself or of any person in his employ I feel confident that from the well known character of British juries it would be quite unnecessary for me to claim a fair and impartial verdict not one particle of evidence has been adduced to criminate me - in which opinion if you coincide you will give me the benefit of it - if not it will be my painful lot to bow to your verdict but in that case I implore your lordship to pass the mildest sentence which will answer the ends of public justice WARREN -

it was a very dark wet morning - I saw Godfrey go into a recess at the further end of the shop - it is a long shop and I saw Mugford put something into his basket - I am positive it was him - I swear he is the man who put the bag into the basket because he came to the shop-door and looked into the street Q How can you swear to the particular acts of any one man A By their heights and dress and everything I could see their dresses because there were two candles and a lamp burning in the shop Cross-examined by MR ARNOLD Q Had you ever seen Key before A Never -

I went out that evening from ten minutes to a quarter past nine o clock with Thomas Leekey - I left the prisoner in the shop - I gave him directions to clear the window and shut up the shop - he asked me if I was going to Mr Gibson s the Craven Arms - I said yes I believed I should and he said he should come as soon as he had closed - he did not come there but about a quarter before ten o clock a man in the employ of Mr Thwaites came for me - I came home and found my shop stripped of every thing that was moveable almost and two or three policemen were in the shop - when I went out there were ninety-one yards of cloth there worth about 82l eight waistcoats worth 5l nineteen waistcoat-pieces worth 5l four coats worth 15l and the other articles stated in the indictment - I have not seen any of them since - the prisoner was gone when I got home - there were no marks of violence on the door as if any one had broken in - the prisoner did not sleep in my house - he generally came in the morning but the police took him the next morning Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q These things would have formed a considerable bulk A Yes I went out that evening with Mr Leekey who lives in the same house - we both took the house together - he is also a tailor - he is not in partnership with me - he has a weekly salary - I know these bills which are headed Leekey and Broughton - we had been in partnership but that had been dissolved six weeks before this robbery - on the 16th of January - none of these bills have been given out since to my knowledge - Leekey was before the magistrate - I believe he stated that he was not a partner with me but I was in such a state I could attend to nobody s evidence but my own - sometimes the lock of my door does not catch if the window has not been shut right - I believe the door was found open one morning by a person who was in my employ - I have not been forced to open it with a poker - it is possible that if the window had not been shut right a person might push the door open - there was nothing of mine found on the prisoner or about him COURT Q Was it his business to leave the window and door secure A Yes if he had shut the window and placed the post right the door would shut itself when he went out ANN BROUGHTON I am the prosecutor s wife - I went into the shop that evening about a quarter before ten o clock- I found every thing had been taken out of it - Bray had come up stairs about a quarter or twenty minutes before ten o clock and I asked him how he got in and from what he told me I went down to the shop - I found the shop-door ajar but there was no appearance of its having been forced open - the tickets of prices which had been on the clothes were strewed about the bottom of the window - they ought to have been in a drawer or on the mantelpiece - I had never seen them so strewed about before - I had not been in the shop that evening from a quarter past nine o clock till a quarter before ten o clock but I had passed down the stair-case three times - there is a staircase door which leads into the shop and each time I came down it was shut - it is usually kept open in the evening JOSEPH BRAY I am twelve years old - I know thenecessity of telling the truth - I lodge at Mr Broughton s but I am errand-boy at No 29 St Martin s-lane - I got home to Mr Broughton s on the night in question about a quarter before ten o clock - as I was crossing the road opposite his shop I saw a man outside pushing the door open - he looked round and saw me and pulled the door to again - he then walked away towards Middle-row - I went in at the door which he had left ajar and went up stairs - I met Mrs Broughton on the stairs and she asked me how I got in - I saw the shop-windows were empty and the blocks were naked - the man who came out at the shop door was a tall man - I knew the prisoner before - I do not know whether he was the man who came out of the door - I did not see his face - he walked along and another man not so tall as he was joined him Cross-examined Q How long had you lived in that house A I do not know Sir - I believe about a month - I had seen the prisoner constantly going in and out - I leave my place in St Martin s-lane at ten o clock at night - my master had not given me a holiday and sent me home earlier that night than usual - I do not know what time it was when I got to Mr Broughton s but my usual time of leaving St Martin s-lane is ten o clock - one of the men was a tall man - I do not know whether he was the prisoner - when Mrs Broughton came into the shop the door was shut - I shut it when I went in COURT Q Was the man who came out and shut the door taller or shorter or about the same height as the prisoner A I think about the same height ELIZABETH LEEKEY I am the wife of Thomas Leekey I lodge at the prosecutor s I was at home that evening and heard Sarah Ward the servant go down stairs about half-past nine o clock - I then heard the stair-door shut which makes a loud noise and shakes my room - I sent my sister down stairs to know why the door was shut - that door leads from the stairs into the shop and it is not a usual thing to shut it - I have been in the habit of coming down if I heard any one in the shop to see what was going on and therefore that door was always left open - when I sent my sister down she returned up again to me and soon afterwards the prisoner came up as soon as he had shut the shop - I did not see him shut the shop but I heard it - he then came up stairs in consequence of my having sent my sister down to tell him I wanted to speak to him - he had promised to lend me a book and I asked him for it - he said he had not got it he had left it at Somers Town - he was finishing putting on his coat when he spoke to me - he then went out of my room and shut my room door which I never have shut - he wished me good night and seemed in a bustle as it was rather later than usual for him - Mrs Broughton then came into my room and the little boy came up - we all went down and found the shop was stripped - I think from the time of the prisoner coming up stairs and our going down and finding the shop stripped was about two minutes - it might have been rather more as I was working a bracelet and was rather engaged upon it - the cloth that had been in the shop was all solid cloth and heavy - I do not think one man could have taken it away in two or three minutes MR BROUGHTON I should think it would have taken two men ten minutes to have taken away the property if they had known the place - it would take a stranger I should think a quarter of an hour JURY to ELIZABETH LEEKEY Q Was the prisoner in the habit of coming up to your room A He was in the habit of coming up at night and saying he was going and asking me to attend to the door but I had not been at home till the last fortnight of his being there COURT Q When he came up in the evening was he in the habit of shutting your door A I do not know that he has shut it - I remember he closed it once Cross-examined Q You have stated you heard the staircase door leading into the shop shut and that it was always left open A Yes by my wish it was but it is a door that makes a noise when it shuts as it does not catch well - it had lately been shut more frequently - I heard it shut that evening as it shook my room - whoever went down stairs into the shop must have opened that door again - the prisoner said he lived at Somers Town SARAH WARD I am servant to Mrs Broughton She sent me out that evening at twenty minutes before ten o clock - when I went down the staircase door was shut and I opened it and went into the shop - there is no other way out of the house but at the shop door - the prisoner and a young man were in the shop - no other person - the young man went out of the shop as I went in - the prisoner did not go out - I think the young man was not so tall as the prisoner but I did not see his face - I asked the prisoner if that was Robert - he said No it was a young man and he said something else which I do not recollect - the prisoner was putting his coat on - I noticed the busts in the shop were without coats - I had never seen them off before - I went out and returned in about ten minutes - the shop was then full of policemen Cross-examined Q Had you been in the habit of noticing the shop at night A No this was on a Wednesday night - I do not know that the prisoner had been in the habit of folding up the coats on Wednesday and Saturday evenings COURT Q Had you been in the shop on Wednesday and Saturday evenings A Yes - I never saw the busts without the coats before MR BROUGHTON It was not the prisoner s practice to fold up the coats on those nights Cross-examined Q Did he never fold up the coats that were in the shop A The coats which were on the busts were two that were made on purpose for them - I do not know that they were ever folded up or taken off but by myself - I am out in the evening sometimes but when I came home I must have seen if the busts had been without coats as I passed close by them and I never did see that - there are gas-lights in the shop - one of them continues burning a little all night HENRY BROWN I slept in Sydney-street Somers Town in the same bed with the prisoner - I went to bed that night about twelve o clock the prisoner had not then come home - I lay awake till a little after one o clock- the prisoner then came home EDWARD SHAYLER police-constable S 187 I went to Sydney-street and took the prisoner the next morning - I told him I wanted him on suspicion of being concerned in a robbery - he said Dear me it is very strange ifthere has been a robbery at Mr Broughton s I left the shop safe last night at half-past nine o clock - I said You are my prisoner and must go with me to the station-house - in going along I asked him what time he got home - he said Ask me no questions I shall answer you none if you do - I found nothing on him nor in his room connected with this robbery COURT to SARAH WARD Q How do you know it wanted twenty minutes to ten o clock when you went down into the shop A I looked at the dial in the shop Prisoner s Defence The boy said they were two short men in frock coats and I wore a dress coat When Mr Broughton and Mr Leekey went out together I was told to take the things down it generally took me a quarter of an hour to do that I had done about twenty-five minutes past nine o clock Mrs Leekey then sent her sister down to ask me about a book I was to lend her - I said I could not get it that night as it was too far to go to Somers -town and return I then went out and slammed the door after me - Mr Broughton knows that the door had been left open all night and one of the workmen came in at the door the next morning I went to a public-house in Oxford-street that night and left a quarter before twelve o clock I then went home and was taken the next morning GUILTY Aged 20 -

t18340515-134  874 SAMUEL JAMES HODGSON was indicted for stealing on the 15th of April 3 yards of silk value 8s the goods of Thomas Gardner his master SUSAN GARDNER I am the wife of Thomas Gardner I keep a haberdasher s shop in Norton-falgate - the prisoner was in my service about five weeks - on the 15th of April I desired to see his box with an officer - I thought I saw him take something up with his coat - I took the coat and found this paper with this silk folded in it - I said This is my silk - the prisoner said That silk I bought and paid for and I can show you an invoice of it - he then paused some minutes and said Can you swear to that silk - I said I can - there are about three yards of it - here is a notch which corresponds with the roll of silk that was in the shop - I went into the shop and compared the silk and it matched exactly - the prisoner then said If you will walk up stairs I will explain it to you - he then said I have cut the silk off - he went on his knees and begged me to forgive him - I said No you thought very little of robbing me but for the protection of my own property I must give you into custody - he had no right to cut that silk Cross-examined by MR STAMMERS Q How long have you been in the retail trade A About seventeen years -if a shopman wishes to purchase any thing the custom is for him to apply to another person in the shop and have it cut off and then bring it to his employer to have it entered in a book - it is not the custom for a shopman to take goods for his own use and to enter it in the evening - the prisoner never mentioned to me that he wanted a piece of silk of this kind - he says he named it to some of my young people - I received information of this from my boy and sent for the officer - the prisoner looked into his pocket-book for the invoice of this but did not find it and when he went up stairs he said he cut it off the roll WILLIAM ALEFOUNDER I am shop-boy to the prosecutor I was there that morning - I saw the prisoner come to the top of the shop and take a yard measure down - he went to the bottom of the shop put his hand under the wrapper took down a piece of silk and put it on the counter - he put the yard measure to the silk and took the scissors out of his pocket and cut the silk off - he put it into his pocket rolled the roll up and put it into its place Cross-examined Q Where were you A At the door cleaning the window - there was no one in the shop - he did not conceal this - there was a pile of boxes before him - he did not cut off a random piece - he measured it with the stick - I do not think there was a carpenter at work BENJAMIN BEAVIS I was sent for to take the prisoner- the silk was found in my presence Prisoner s Defence I deny any felonious intention of appropriating it to my own use - it is the custom of our trade for a shopman to have any goods he may want - it is immaterial whether it is measured by yourself or any one else - I can bring two witnesses who will swear that I showed them a piece of silk on the Thursday before and on the Monday I ascertained what quantity I wanted - the value of a young man depends on his knowing his business with regard to leaving such a length of silk as may be of benefit to his employer - I said to one of my witnesses that if I cut three yards off one of the pieces it would be an injury as it would leave but eleven yards which would be an unsaleable length - it is not likely if I had wished to appropriate this to my own use that I should take the measure and cut it off - the carpenter stood close to me when I cut it off but I have not been able to procure him - he said to me Shall I remove Sir am I in your way - I said No not at all - there were boards on the counter but they did not conceal me at all - this boy has had an animosity against me for a fortnight before - he cannot deny that on the Wednesday or Thursday before he was very saucy and I told him I would box his ears - he continued his impertinence and I took hold of his ears but did not hurt him - his father came there that day - I told him and he desired me to correct him at any time - on the morning this happened he was very sancy while he was on the steps - I was obliged to tell him to do the windows over again - he said Mr Withers who was my predecessor never told him to do it and he would not - I said he was very saucy and if it were not that I should have to pay for the glass I would knock him off the steps and when I went to breakfast he said I had been cutting off silk and not entered it- it is only spite and malice that has induced this charge by him - all that I have had has been entered both cash and goods MARGARET GLYNN I am Mrs Gardner s niece I help her in her shop On the 8th of April the prisoner had some stockings and some ribbon for his own use at a low price and Mrs Gardner entered them in the book - I think it was about the same time the prisoner told me he wanted a piece of silk for some bonnets - I told him it would take three yards to make two bonnets which I understood he wanted - he brought two pieces to me and said one was fourteen yards long and he asked if I thought two yards would do for the bonnets as it would leave twelve yards which would make a dress - I told him I thought it would require three yards - he said he thought he should have it but he did not say what quantity - I never entered things- I never knew any one to have things when Mrs Gardner was not there COURT Q Did he tell you he had cut off three yards A No He never desired me to enter it to him MARY ANN PRIESTLY I am apprentice to Mrs Gardner I was standing by the last witnesses when the prisoner asked her what quantity it would take to make two bonnets - she said Three yards and I said so too MRS GARDNER re-examined I searched the prisoner s box about half-past eight o clock that morning - when I heard of this I called the boy up - the prisoner asked him how he dared to say such a thing and put himself in a great passion - I said Do not put yourself in a passion you have no objection to my searching your box - he said No nor my person either - I then sent for the officer Field Wade painter and Joseph Charles Jefferys gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 32 -

t18340703-142  1034 GEORGE HILTON WILLIAM CONSTABLE and THOMAS PARKER were indicted for stealing on the 20th of May 8 bushels of oats value 21s the goods of Samuel Hayhurst Lucas the master of the said W Constable and T Parker and Thomas Lewis was indicted for feloniously receiving the same well knowing it to be stolen 3rd COUNT For feloniously receiving it of an evil-disposed person MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution JAMES CLARK police-serjeant N 15 On the 20th of May I was on duty at Kingsland and saw a van loaded with sacks of corn driven by the prisoner Hilton - the name of Crouch was on the van - it went to the Elephant and drew down the yard to the stable door - I saw Hilton and Lewis who is the ostler there - they left the stable door for a few minutes and then came back - Lewis then went to the top of the street for what purpose I cannot say - he then came back and Hilton met him - Hilton then got on the van and gave Lewis two sacks of oats off the van who took them into the stable - I took Hilton into custody and took him into the stable with me - I found Lewis there behind the inner stable door - I said to him Tom it is no use concealing yourself I saw the two sacks taken from the van - he said I know nothing about them - the carter asked me to let him leave them here for a person - Hilton made no reply - I called for assistance and took them and the two sacks to the station-house - I found a delivery note on Hilton for thirteen quarters of oats - there were twenty-six sacks on the van besides the two I saw carried into the stable - from what I learned afterwards I went to Mr Lucas and Constable and Parker were produced in the counting-house - Mr Lucas asked them if Mr Crouch s van had been there that day - Constable said it came for thirteen quarters of oats and I believe both the prisoners said so - Mr Lucas asked how they knew there were only thirteen quarters - Constable said the entry was on the slate - Mr Lucas then asked how they accounted for the van having fourteen quarters in it - they said if it had fourteen quarters it was more than they knew - Mr Lucas asked if they were not in the habit of counting the sacks when they were not in the habit of counting the sacks when they were brought up for a quantity of corn - they said Yes but they believed they did not on that day - Mr Lucas said it was strange they should deliver a load of corn to a van and not know what quantity they had delivered - Constable said they had been in a hurry that day and if the van had fourteen quarters it was unknown to them - I do not recollect any thing more passing - I received a sample of oats from Mr Lucas - I took another sample from the sacks which were delivered at the stable and the other sample is from the bulk of the thirteen quarters - Hilton made a statement before the magistrates which was taken down Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q At what time did you see the sacks taken from the cart A About two o clock - it was broad daylight - it was about three hundred yards from the station-house - Constable at once acknowledged that Crouch s van had been there - he never attempted to deny it - he said there was a hurry of business that day - I do not know that there was such a hurry of business that the men were not allowed to have their dinner - the men gave fair straight-forward answers SAMUEL HAYHURST LUCAS I am proprietor of the granary on Hambro wharf On the 19th of May I sold twenty quarters of oats to Mr Crouch of Edmonton - it is customary to give a printed order to the man with a blank to fill up - I gave it to Constable - he delivers it to the man who takes the corn away - Constable was my foreman and Parker was in my service - when any one came for corn they were equally employed one in holding up sacks and the other in measuring the corn - I have no doubt there were loose sacks in my granary - the granaries are lofty from the ground and the sacks are let down by two servants - the carman remains in the cart - here is the counter-part of the delivery note signed by Hilton and left on the premises with Constable - the officer came on the 20th May and I sent for Parker and Constable into the counting-house - I asked them whether Crouch s waggon had been there that day - they said yes they had given him thirteen quarters of corn - I asked if they were quite sure it was thirteen quarters and their answer was they had no doubt of it - they both spoke - I told them it was ascertained that the carman had deposited two sacks of oats at the Elephant at Kingsland that Hilton had been taken into custody on a charge of stealing them and I was certain he could not have taken the corn without their giving it him and I desired them to explain how it was - they said if he had more than thirteen quarters they did not know of it and on my inquiring if they had counted the sacks they admitted they had not - they both gave the same answer - it was the duty of Parker to count the sacksbefore they began to load and it was the duty of both of them to ascertain the quantity they delivered out - they stated they were so busy they could not count the sacks - I asked them if they were not busy on other occasions - they admitted they were but excused themselves by saying they were busy - I told them I should fell it my duty to give them into custody as I could not proceed against the carman without them - I have examined these samples and it is my opinion they are the same oats Cross-examined Q Have you ascertained whether there was any hurry that day A There was - it was not a hurry that would excuse such an omission as that - Constable has been in my employ sixteen or eighteen years and Parker six or seven - I have three or four other men regularly in my employ and many others occasionally - Samuel Weller was a porter at my house that day and I think he has been so since - he had been occasionally employed by my foreman before - he was taken as a witness before the Grand Jury but it was for the purpose of the prisoners I think - I did not inquire of him whether that was a hurried day or not SAMUEL LUCAS I am son of the prosecutor I made out the order for the delivery of the twenty quarters of oats - I remember the officer coming and I delivered this sample to him which I took from the bulk in our granary from which Crouch s corn was delivered - I have compared it with the sample taken from the two sacks and the sample from the thirty-six quarters - it is my firm belief they are all from the same bulk Cross-examined Q Is there not more corn like this in the kingdom A I dare say there is a good deal - this corn is particularly long - there may be thousands of quarters of this sort - it is Irish oats JOHN VALENTINE CROUCH I am a corn-dealer and live at Upper Edmonton On the 19th of May I purchased twenty quarters of corn for my sister - I gave this order to Hilton for thirteen quarters and I gave him twenty-six sacks for it - the officer brought home twenty-six sacks of corn and he took a sample Cross-examined Q Did you swear before the Magistrate I did not measure the corn A I did measure it after it came out of the van - I could not say I did not measure it - I did not say so to my recollection - I forget whether I did not SAMUEL WELLER I was in the employ of the prosecutor on the day this happened Cross-examined Q How long had you been there before A Perhaps a week or two - I never saw Constable or Parker except when I was at work there - the day stated was a very busy one - Constable s wife brought his dinner to him but he had not time to eat it - I had no communication with Parker and Constable to induce them to say it was a busy day - there had been a mistake in counting sacks a day or two before COURT Q What time of day was it the dinner was brought by the wife A I suppose about twelve o clock - I cannot say how long the wife waited - to the best of my recollection Crouch s van was there from eleven to twelve o clock - I cannot say whether the dinner came while the van was there MR CLARKSON Q Did you help to load the van A No I saw Constable and Parker filling sacks - the sacks were brought up by a truck or on a man s back - I cannot tell whether there were more than twenty-six sacks WILLIAM ELLAM police-constable N 86 I drove the van with the thirteen quarters of corn in it to Edmonton I did not alter it WILLIAM HERITAGE I am clerk to the magistrates at Worship-street I took down from Hilton s mouth what he said when called on for his defence - I read it to him - he did not sign it nor make a mark - it was read it to him - he did not sign it nor make a mark - it was read twice to him and the magistrate signed it - I asked if it was true and if he had any additions to make Read The prisoner Hilton says I received sacks for thirteen quarters of my master - I only received thirteen quarters of corn from Mr Lucas s granary but at Stones-end a man whom I know by sight but not by name asked me to carry two sacks of corn for him and pitch them at the Elephant which I did The prisoners Constable and Parker said that which was stated by Mr Lucas and the constable Clark was correct COURT to J CLARK Q What kind of sacks were those which were taken from the van A One was an old flour sack and the other had the name of Allen on it COURT to Mr LUCAS Q What kind of sacks had you in your granary A All sorts almost - I think I might say no flour sacks of my own - I am not aware whether I had any with the name of Allen on them COURT to J V CROUCH Q What kind of sacks did you give Hilton A Some of my own and some with odd marks - I do not know whether I had any with the name of Allen on them - I have known Hilton for nearly four years he had a very good character James Winch a publican gave Lewis a good character and Andrew Realton of Edmonton gave Hilton a good character HILTON -

I received information and have seen a great number of boots and shoes which I know to be mine they were found at the pawnbroker s STEPHEN SMITH I am foreman to the prosecutor and have been so for three years I had suspected the prisoner - I saw him make two attempts to pocket shoes on the 27th of June and on the 28th I saw a pair in his left hand pocket - I charged him with it - he first denied it and then said he had a pair of old ones - the shop then began to fill and he came to me and said he hoped he might rest happy and safe in my not communicating the circumstance to Mr Lloyd - he then turned out of the shop and on the Monday I told Mr Lloyd - these are the shoes I saw in his pocket - I could read the figures on the toes of them as he walked about WILLIAM DODD police-constable C 179 I received information and went to Mr Lloyd s on the 30th of June Mr Lloyd sent for George Filewood and said to him Have I not heard something unpleasant about you - he said not that he knew of - I took him to the station and he gave me his address in Lambeth-walk - I went there and found one pair of Blucher boots one pair of shoes one spur and a duplicate of a pair of shoes - I then made search amongst the pawnbrokers and found above two hundred pairs in all Cross-examined by MR CHURCHILL Q Those you found at his house had been worn A They appeared tohave been worn once One pair was in the bureau and one pair on the floor - I went to the other pawnbrokers through finding the duplicates at his lodgings WILLIAM BRYMER PYATT I am shopman to a pawnbroker I have seen George Filewood at my master s - he has pawned boots and shoes there - I have seen James Filewood there frequently - I have five pair of shoes - one pair of boots was pawned by James Filewood - I cannot swear which of them pawned the others - part were brought by one and part by the other Cross-examined by MR CHURCHILL Q You are sure that one pair was pawned by one of the prisoners A Yes I cannot say which pair he left - I always had a suspicion of both the prisoners that they pawned them with the intention of leaving them and I was careful not to lend too much on them - I lent 5s on this pair - they would fetch me about 5s - we frequently lend 6s on things which will not fetch more than 5s to people we know - this pair of boots was pawned on the 30th of December - the prisoners pawned these four pairs of shoes and James Filewood the boots EDWARD WOOD I have four pair of shoes pawned with me - I cannot say by whom WILLIAM ROBERTS I am shopman to Mr Archbold a pawnbroker Bridge-road Lambeth I have the duplicates of twenty-two pairs of shoes which were given up to the prosecutor - they were all pawned by James Filewood - here are a great many other duplicates of shoes and boots taken in by other young men Cross-examined by MR GURNEY Q Do you know what business James Filewood is A No I have purchased shoes of him believing them to be his own property- these are common country-made shoes JOHN MICHAEL JONES I am shopman to Mr Barnes a pawnbroker in the Strand I had six pair of shoes and one pair of boots which I gave up to Mr Lloyd at Marlborough-street - these are the boots - they were brought by James Filewood - I had taken in several pair of shoes of him before and I told him unless I was satisfied that they belonged to him I would detain him - he said he was a shoemaker and lived in Rose-street Long-acre and he would go and fetch a card or I might go with him or he would bring some person with him - he left the boots to go and fetch a card but he never returned Cross-examined by MR CHURCHILL Q Had he often pawned with you A Yes many pairs of shoes - I advanced a fair value on them - we do not usually advance a full value on goods which we do not expect will be redeemed - I believe it is done HENRY ROE I am shopman to Mr Attenborough a pawnbroker I produce some shoes - I cannot say who pawned them Cross-examined by MR GURNEY Q Is there any thing peculiar in these shoes A No they are common Northampton shoes which no one can swear to unless there is a mark on them -

the man who made them is here but he cannot swear they were made for me - one pair of those produced by Pyatt were marked by the prisoner the rest I only know from having lost so great a number Cross-examined by MR GURNEY Q Do you know when they were marked A I have no earthly conception- I seldom sell in my shop - I think it not very probable that these were sold by my shopman finding them as I did- I think James Filewood could not have bought them for 5s a pair - he could have sold them for more than he pawned them - I have missed great quantities of boots and shoes - I have not found the fourth part of what I lost - I do not know that I have complained of my apprentice not entering goods sent to country shops - I have no recollection of persons calling to pay for goods which had not been entered - it may have happened - that may account for a pair or two - some of these cost me 5s a pair some as little as 3s 6d COURT to WILLIAM BRYMER PYATT Q Are you quite sure that these four pair of shoes were pawned by the prisoners A Yes some by one and some by the other but I cannot say which - I never saw them both together George Filewood s Defence I never had any thing to do with any of them - when Mr Pyatt was before the magistrate he said he had seen me in his shop but could not swear to my pawning any of the shoes James Filewood s Defence I have been in the habit of buying and selling shoes many years -

they were kept in my trunk in France - I did not go before the authorities there about it - I came to town to overtake the prisoner - I employed Parish the policeman Q Did you say to the prisoner If you will confess the robbery and restore the money no more shall be done to you A No - I said Sam what do you mean by robbing me - he said I don t know - I did not offer him pardon or forgiveness or any thing to that effect - he delivered a bag of forty-one sovereigns to the officer - the officer did not tell him he would forgive him if he would restore the money in my presence - he was unwilling to give it up - he gave it up for fear of being punished I suppose - I said nothing to him about being punished - I left it all to the officer - he said I must search you - he seemed unwilling to be searched and moved about and pulled out the silk purse - the canvass bag was found about his watch fob - after some altercation he produced it - I have got back 41 sovereigns and 15s from him - I lost 40l - after the money was produced I said he might go back with me and work with me again and save his character -

I waited till the box was returned and waited to see if the prisoner came for the box - he did not and next day at one o clock I went there and saw him with another person near the window - from the description I had received I believed him to be the man - I saw him go into the office and ask if his box had come - he was told Yes - I then asked if he was going to Nottingham - I took him to a house where the prosecutor was and told him I apprehended him for robbing him - he said What I have done I have done in France - I am not in France now and am not amenable - I said You will find the difference - I took him to another house and told him I must search him - he said he would not be searched - I took him into a corner and he let me search him - I took a purse from his left hand pocket which the prosecutor identified - I afterwards went to his other pocket but I could not get my hand to the bottom -

the prosecutor did not say if he would confess the robbery and restore the money he would forgive him nor any thing of the kind - he did not tell him in my presence that as he had restored the money he should return to France and continue in his situation - he said to me at the door I would not mind giving the poor fellow a sovereign to start him on the road though he has used me so - he did not say if he chose to go to Nottingham he would give him 2l 10s to pay his expenses in my hearing but he had an opportunity of saying it in my absence as I went to Guildhall to ask if it could be entered into in this country - the prosecutor never asked me for the money - he said before the magistrate that he did not wish to prosecute and he might have said so to me but I think he did not - I am certain he never asked for the money -

he keeps a hair-dresser s shop in Clifford-street - I let part of the house in lodgings - the prisoner came into my service on the 17th of February and remained until the 10th of July - I missed a great number of things and after she had left I applied for a search warrant - I knew where she was to be found - I had a nurse-maid named Eliza Chandler she accompanied me with Schofield and Avis on the 31st of July to No 6 West-row Carnaby-market - I inquired for the prisoner - she was not at home and Schofield went to look for her - I found a person named Glasse there she went with Schofield to find the prisoner - I had not learned what part of the house the prisoner occupied but I found in the back kitchen this shawl of Chandler s which was tied up in a bundle - Avis opened it before Schofield returned and every thing here with the exception of this china cup and saucer and this pincushion were in it - I have every reason to believe these wax candles are my husband s but of course I cannot swear to them - there are twenty pieces and six whole ones - we had candles exactly like them and the prisoner had opportunities of taking them - I had repeatedly missed pieces and whole ones - here is a diaper napkin and a small table-cloth which I know to be my husband s - I told the officer there were the letters M D onthe napkin but it has been picked out - I can see where it has been picked out - this table-cloth is marked W H - before I was married my name was Hemming and I had been in partnership with a person named Wills - W H were the initials of our names - I missed this the first fortnight the prisoner was with me - this chocolate stirrer and powder box I know and I had missed them - I had missed this glass salt holder the day before I went to the prisoner - this little sugar basin these spoons and these glass bottles I had missed - besides these articles which I found in the shawl I found this cup and saucer on the shelf - I have no doubt they are mine - when the officer came back with the prisoner her attention was called to three boxes which were in the back kitchen - Schofield asked which were her boxes and she pointed to them - two of them were locked - the officer had the bunch of keys in his hand and he asked her which were the keys of the boxes - in the first box he found fifty numbers of the Mirror and the Penny Magazine - I had lost such and I believe them to be mine - when he was about to search the second box she denied its being hers though she had before claimed it and said it belonged to Mrs Glasse - Mrs Glasse said My dear don t you remember I sold it to you the prisoner said Yes I had quite forgotten it she pointed out the key and Schofield opened it and found in it these eight curtains which are my husband s property - in the third box he found this piece of brown holland which I had not missed but it is mine - all these articles are my property but this shawl which is my servant s - they are all of small value Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q And yet that shawl she is charged with stealing A I did not charge her with stealing it but she is charged with having stolen it - after she left me a woman named Sarah Parr came to my house from the prisoner to tell my nursemaid that the prisoner had her shawl and desiring her to go to her for it and to take her a shilling which she owed her - I did not abuse the messenger and the prisoner - I said the prisoner was a very artful woman she had robbed me and at a future time she might expect to see me - and if she would come herself she might have her two aprons which she had left in her bed-room if she would return half-a-crown to a young man who was servant to one of my lodgers - it was about a week before she was taken that I sent this message - if she had received that message she had that week to have got rid of the property but I do not know that she ever received the message - I did not know where the prisoner was living till Mrs Parr came and told my nursemaid who told me - there was no letter came to my house for the prisoner - she brought a letter of character with her - I gave that letter to Mrs Hampton the lady the prisoner lived with before she came to me I mean Mrs Colonel Hampton the lady who prosecuted her before - I gave it her because I knew she was under an indictment for perjury - the prisoner told me where she lived and I gave her the letter - I do not consider that letter belonged to the prisoner - she gave it me and begged me to keep it until she took her trial - I heard that the prisoner was to be a witness against Mrs Hampton - the prisoner wished me to give her a character and therefore I did not suspect her as I thought her character would be of more value to her than these trifling things - I took up one article in one of the boxes which I thought was my husband s front but it was not and I took up some ostrich feathers but they were not mine - I do not know that I claimed any other things which the prisoner proved were hers - there were some plates and dishes taken down and I said I had lost a great many but I did not claim them - Mrs Glass said they were hers and I said Then take them - I do not know that I swore to any things at the police-office which are not in this indictment MR CLARKSON Q Are there any things which are left out of this indictment because the prisoner could give clear proof that they were hers A There was a little pomatum pot and the officer asked me if I could swear to that - I said No - I only knew that my husband had a great many such and it was taken out - I have no connexion with Mrs Hampton - I never permitted the prisoner to have any of these things GEORGE AVIS I am an officer of Marlborough-street I went with Mrs Dove to a house occupied by Mr Randall in West-row Carnaby Market - the prisoner was not there and Schofield went in search of her - I saw these articles found tied up in this shawl - when the prisoner came I asked her if that bundle and its contents were hers - she said Yes - I opened it and asked her if the candles were hers - she said Yes and that she had them when she lived with Mrs Hampton - I asked some other questions but she declined giving any more answers BENJAMIN SCHOFIELD I went with West-row - the prisoner was not there and I went with Mrs Glasse to No 15 Maddox-street where we found the prisoner - I told her in Mrs Glasse s presence that I had a search-warrant to search her apartment and she must come home - we left the house together and in going along Maddox-street I observed Mrs Glasse hang a little behind and I saw her take something white from the prisoner which she appeared to put into her right hand pocket - when we got opposite the office I said to the prisoner You must step in here - she made no objection but Mrs Glasse tried to get away and I was obliged to hold her and call for assistance - we went into the office and I took them into a private room - I then said to Mrs Glasse Now tell me what the prisoner gave you in Maddox-street - she hesitated some minutes and said Nothing - I said I am sure she did and you have got it in your right hand pocket - she had her hand in that pocket at that time and she drew out this pocket which the prisoner admitted was hers - I found this bunch of keys in it - we then went to West-row and I asked the prisoner if she had any boxes - she said Yes and pointed to three behind the door - I proceeded to search them and these articles were found as has been described ELIZA CHANDLER This is my shawl Cross-examined Q Did you owe the prisoner a shilling A No ninepence - I remember Parr coming with a message from her WILLIAM CHARLES CHRISTIAN HUMPHRIES My father is the attorney in this prosecution Here is the list of articles supposed to be lost by the prosecutor - it is in my handwriting - here is a shawl struck off by my father sdirection because it did not belong to Mrs Dove but the list was given in and that is the reason the shawl was included in this indictment Prisoner s Defence My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury I must beg your indulgence while I state the full particulars of every thing - I entered the service of Mrs Dove as servant of all work with a written character from Mr Daniel Vickery of Sandown-place Bristol with whom I had lived twelve months previous to my going into the service of Mrs Colonel Hampton but Mr Vickery having by mistake written my name Hickers in a former character it was reported after my trial at the Old Bailey that it was a forgery and on my applying for a situation that character was refused I referred them to Mr Hilyer of Poland-street Oxford-street who had visited the family and seen me there and I called on him begging him to state so - he said he remembered me perfectly well and he remembered Mr Vickery speaking highly of me but the body of the letter being Mrs Vickery s writing Mr Hilyer could not swear to it and I was then thrown upon the open world without friend or home and destitute of character - in this distress I applied to Mr Hilyer and stated the case to him exactly as it was - he pitied me much and wished me to write to Mr Vickery informing him of my situation and begging him to write my character in his own handwriting which Mr Hilyer would be able to prove was no forgery - but in three or four days after my trial and acquittal here I was thrown upon a sick bed and confined by very serious illness for a great length of time - as soon as I was sufficiently recovered to take a situation I wrote to Mr Vickery - I did not receive an answer for two or three days and I wrote again begging him to state the character I deserved while I was in his employ - in answer to this he sent a letter stating that I had lived twelve months in his service and had conducted myself well - this letter concluded with his name and address but it was directed to me by the name of Mrs Hickers - I observed he had spelt my name wrong but as my character had been so much injured by the prosecution that I could not take a situation as lady s maid I did not mention the mistake - I then heard of Mrs Dove s situation - I applied there and took my character - she read it and said if I thought proper to take her situation at six pounds a year as servant of all work she would hire me there were six of her family four lodgers and all the washing done at home - but she said it would be made up to as good as thirty guineas a year - I entered her service and when I had been about three weeks I was one day standing at the door when I saw Madam and Mr Follet go by - I was aware that they knew me and I was much afraid they would inform Mrs Dove who I was by which means I might lose my situation - Mrs Dove s was the most wretched situation I ever heard of- still I determined to remain as I knew I was starving and was striving to regain a character which had been taken from me - a month passed on and I observed a very great change in Mrs Dove s behaviour - I was afraid she had heard that I had lived with Mrs Hampton - in a few days after she called me into her room and said I understand I have got a thief in my house and you have lived with Mrs Colonel Hampton - I said I had - she then said I am informed you are married - I said I am - she said You have entered my service with a false name - I said No I have not - I then explained the circumstances to her and referred her to Mr Hilyer of Poland-street - she then said I have heard a most desperate character of you and Mrs Hampton has fearful apprehensions of you on her trial and it would be better for you to go out of town - I said I am a witness against her and nothing shall induce me to leave London - she then said Mrs Hampton will give me any sum of money to get you out of the way that you should not appear on the trial - I said I was afraid she would hear of me as when Madam and Mr Follet passed and saw me I knew they would tell who I was - I stated how much I had suffered and how much I dreaded a repetition of the past - she said she felt much for me and if I would stay so far from allowing Hampton s party to injure me she would protect me - I then passed two months in her service suffering every privation - I had not a sufficiency of food to eat having nothing but dry bread for eight or nine days together in fact we were half-starved yet I submitted to it to regain my character - there was a gentleman named Palmer lived on the second floor - I had to clean his shoes and boots and he found his own blacking - there was also another gentleman who lived on the third floor whose shoes I had to clean and Mrs Dove was to find blacking - she told me to black them with the other gentleman s blacking and she made out bills for them as if they were cleaned at the hotel giving me strict orders not to tell Mr Palmer s servant - I had frequent opportunities of witnessing Mrs Dove taking sugar and whitey brown paper of his and if sixpenny-worth of biscuits came she would take three or four of them - finding this to be the case I had very little hopes of getting more than the 6l a year - the time however for Mr Palmer settling his bills came round and Mrs Dove said no doubt he would give me two sovereigns but he gave me nothing - Mr Palmer s servant said that nearly a quarter of a pound of tea was taken - I made a reply Mrs Dove has taken it and she is in the habit of doing it I should not like the gentleman to suppose that I had taken it and if you will tell him this and he will call her I will say the same - and Grant who was then the nursemaid corroborated my statement - when I have told Mrs Dove I was dissatisfied with her situation and that she had deceived me she would fly into a rage and say I ought to be thankful that she kept me and that if I left her she would report it over the neighbourhood and left it be known that I was a person who was tried at the Old Bailey - the gentleman then missed his French polish and he said to Mrs Dove My French polish goes very fast - Mr Dove called me up and said to him Find out the thief and I will prosecute them without mercy - I said Mr Dove you know the shoes on your feet were cleaned with the polish in question - Mrs Dove then flew in a passion and said I was the person who had been prosecuted - that I was the thief who had stolen the blacking and the polish and that Mrs Hampton and her would send me out of the country if possible - I said if she had any charge she might prefer it - Mr Dove wished a policeman to be sent for - I said I wished it too - Mrs Dove then said Her character is well known as a reputed thief and will the gentlemen believe I have robbed them when she is a wellknown condemned felon at the Old Bailey - I then said Iwould leave her service immediately and she desired me to get my things ready and leave the house - I said I had no box there finding there was only a damp kitchen to put it in and her husband was in the habit of routing the boxes and I must back and Mrs Dove said Here is a shawl take this and tie your things in I dare say you are going to Mrs Wilson s - I said No I shall be at Mr Glasse s No 6 West-row Eliza owes me a shilling and if she will call on me with it she shall have the shawl - I tied up my things and took them into the parlour and said if there was any thing of hers she might take it and not to say as she had of the servant I succeeded that she had robbed her of a silver fork and she detained her things - she said she had lost nothing and every thing there was my own - Mr Dove said it was not from any merit due to me but I wished to get a character - when I left I applied to the green grocer for a situation they said they could not think for recommending me as Mrs Dove had represented I was a thief - I said she should prove it - I then sent Parr to desire Mrs Dove to give me the character I gave her and said I would sent to her to give me a character and if she did not give me a just one I would have her up to Marlborough-street- Mrs Dove came out of the parlour and spoke to Parr - she said I was a thief and a robber and if there were a possibility of getting me into Newgate before the week was out she would do it - I sent word I was at Mrs Glasse s in West-row - Parr brought back her message to me but I took no notice of it as I knew I had not taken any thing of hers - on the Thursday following I was at a young woman s in Maddox-street when Schofield came about three o clock in the afternoon - he rang and the servant went to the door - I heard a man say I am an officer of Marlborough-street - I went up and he said to me Ann we have met once more in our lives I have a search- warrant against you - said Who has taken it out - he said Mrs Dove - I had slept with Ann Bargeley the night before and my pocket was on the table- I then took my pocket in my hand though Schofield had sworn that I untied it from my person but that I deny neither did I hand it to Mrs Glasse in any clandestine manner - I had it in my hand and I said Here take me pocket and put in into your pocket as I do not like to be seen carrying it in my hand - when we got to Marlborough-street office he said You must go into the office with me - I made no objection and Schofield persisted in taking Mrs Glasse in - she was then desired to turn out the contents of her pocket - she gave up my pocket and said Here is the pocket that Ann gave me but I do not know that you have any thing to do with mine she was compelled to turn out her pocket but nothing was found but her own property - I was then taken to West-row - I looked at Mrs Dove and said What have you to say against me - she said You shall find out - there was a bundle tied up in the shawl - Schofield said Where are your boxes - I said These three - the first was a deal box without a lock at all and in that these books were found - she then took a baby s cap belonging to me and said This is my husband s false front take it to Marlborough-street - Schofeld said it was a baby s cap and she said It is exactly like my husband s false front and I should have sworn to it - she then took a piece of holland and some other things which she swore to while I stood by silently and allowed her to take any thing she thought proper - the next was a hair trunk - I pointed out the key and it was opened - Mrs Dove took from it these window curtains and said These are my property she has stolen them from me - she turned every thing out but took nothing more - the next was a bonnet-box from which she took three ostrich feathers and said These are mine take them to Marlborough-street - Mrs Glasse said No they belong to Miss Faulker I can swear - Mrs Dove then turned round and said I think we have got enough I forgot my feathers are gone to be cleaned - they then talked of searching Mrs Glasse s trunk - I said it was not mine but I had forgotten that I had bought it of her and I gave the key to Schofield - Mrs Dove said You will find a pair of shoes in that trunk which belong to a lodger of mine - it was opened and the shoes were found- she said These are Mr Palmer s - I said These I took out of pawn with a duplicate which you know I found - Schofield said Where did you find it - I said Down the area - the bundle was then opened and the things were put all together Mrs Dove saying it was all her property and she would take it to Marlborough-street - I said I had had the cup and saucer when I lived at Mrs Hampton s but Mrs Dove said they all belonged to her and they were taken - when I was placed at the bar at seven o clock the office was crowded and Mrs Dove began her statement - she said I had entered her situation with a forged name and a forged character - that I had been a most inveterate thief and that she had dismissed me at a moment s notice and the property produced I had robbed her of - the things were then placed on the bar and she swore to them - when she took the cold cream-pot up Mrs Glasse said it was hers and the magistrate allowed her to withdraw that - she stated that the candles were hers and two of them were moulds but they were all wax and surely if she had lost them she must have known what they were - she then swore to the blue bag and some pieces of soap and the blinds - she then took up the cups and saucers which I can prove are mine and though I cannot unfortunately prove that all the things are mine yet I can prove this brown holland which she has sworn to was never in her house - this china cream-jug and the table-cloth belonged to my mother who is dead - the china cup and saucer I brought from Devonshire and the child s cup and saucer I bought at the door for the purpose of making a present to a friend s little girl -

and these bits of carpet she threw out one day and said You say you have an old footstool at Mrs Glasse s these may do to cover it I now leave it to you to say whether it is likely I would risk my liberty and character for these paltry things which would not fetch me half-a-crown and which if found on me would certainly convict me and whether I would have kept them for a week after I had received her message to have riskedtransportation after enduring what I did in her service to gain a character ANN BARGELEY I live at No 15 Maddox-street -

Mrs Dove told the officer he would find the shoes in the box - I am as innocent of this charge as I am of the previous one - for twenty-four years I never had a lock turned upon me - my character has been irreproachable though it has lain in the west of England which is too far for me to produce it - I have no hesitation in declaring whatever the verdict of the jury may be and whatever I may suffer that I am as innocent as your Lordship is - I am positive it is a conspiracy between Mrs Hampton and Mrs Dove to withdraw me from Mrs Hampton s forthcoming trial -

on the 24th of August we received 24-6 and more afterwards Cross-examined Q As you were not a partner before June you cannot tell what he received before that time A I cannot - he had received a great quantity according to the book -

another the masters of the said Stephen Jordan SAMUEL HOLBROOK I live at No 38 Bridgewater-gardens Barbican and am a basket-maker On the night of the 4th of December I was in a room overlooking the factory of Mr Plummer in Golden-lane at twenty minutes before nine o clock—I observed a bag of cotton wool drop from the premises—the prisoner Leonard picked it up and put it on Baumer s back—it was dropped from about twelve or fourteen feet high into a court which leads into Golden-lane—after Leonard placed it on Baumer s back I saw Jordan drop from the gates—I came down stairs to the door and saw Jordan pass by me as close as eighteen inches—the other prisoners came by and they joined company—I went out at my front door down Brackley-street and met Baumer with the bag—I gave him in charge of the watchman and at that moment I saw Jordan standing opposite in Golden-lane—I went to Mr Plummer s directly Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q What are you A A basket-maker The back of my premises looks on the back of the prosecutor s warehouse—they are about eighteen or twenty feet from it across the way not more—it is a little to the left not directly opposite—I suppose it is from nine to twelve feet to the left—I got the watchman to take Baumer—I saw Jordan standing on the opposite side at the time but I could not take him as I had the bag to carry—the watchman could not take the boy and carry the bag—there were people passing—I did not require their assistance—I knew Jordan so well I knew I could take him at any time if I wanted him—I did not say before the justice that I knew Leonard because he wore a blue coat—I said he bad a blue coat with gilt buttons—I knew his person but I did not know his name—I have nothing to get by this—I have no object but the mere purpose of justice—a sovereign was given to me before the magistrate by Mr Plummer—there was no one in my company when I saw all this—the boy went down Ball-alley into Golden-lane and I went down Bridgewater-gardens—I lost sight of them three or four minutes—there were two gas-lights at the end of the court—it was a very clear night not foggy at all—it was not what I call a foggy night—it was not so clear as it is sometimes—it was neither foggy nor clear—it was not a bright night—I could distinguish clearly what I have sworn to—I have had nothing more than a sovereign nor do I expect any more—I know nothing of Baumer—I have seen Leonard before—I saw his face that night I swear and Jordan s face also—I know them by their faces and dresses—I told the magistrate I knew Leonard by the blue coat which he wore Q Did you tell the magistrate you knew him by his countenance at all A He never asked me and it never occurred to me to say so—I said nothing about his countenance—I had seen him before in that same coat—I told the magistrate I had seen him before—I said I had seen both the prisoners before and I said I knew them Q Why then did you fix on the dress of a man as the meant of knowing him rather than his person which you knew before A I fixed on his person and dress too and I did to before the magistrate—I told you I said so before the magistrate—I do not recollect telling you that I said before the magistrate that I knew him by his coat and not by his countenance—I told the magistrate I knew his person—I meant both the prisoners and I knew them both before—I did not confine my knowledge of them to their dresses before the magistrate I spoke to their persons as well—my deposition was read over to me—I cannot exactly recollect what it was—I do not know that I heard in the deposition that I knew the two men by their persons and clothes—I am sure I cannot recollect whether I described the two men as persons I knew before or merely as persons one wearing a blue coat and the other a jacket—I never saw Mr Plummer before in my life—I am not a pigeon fancier—I have not a trap at the top of my house—it is a mistake being at the top of the house—it is in a window—I do not deal in pigeons—my little boy keeps pigeons—I have not a trap to decoy them from other people—I have no trap at all only what they go into themselves—I never found any pigeons in the trap except what the boy keeps—I never sold one—I never was out bird catching in my life—I have no shop and very little stock—it is in the wholesale line—I am a manufacturer—other people work with me in the business—a shoemaker works in the room with me—I occupy the whole house—I supply the French warehouses and have been in that employ thirteen years—I did not meet any person as I went along from my own house to Golden-lane to my knowledge—the foreman told me three months ago to stop any body with a bag if I saw them—I have been watching near about three months—I did not receive any thing for it—I swear I only received one sovereign which was on the day I was at Guildhall—I had received nothing besides money—I had not agreed what I was to have if I took any body—I had received nothing at all—I was only looking for a quarter of an hour that night—I began to watch when the factory left off work Q Tell us exactly the time this happened A At twenty minutes before nine o clock on the 4th—I looked at my clock down stairs as I went out—that would not delay me in catching the man because it stood at the door—I noticed the time—I just looked at it as I went by—that was the time by Cripplegate church and I keep my clock by that—I prosecuted a man in the New Court about six years ago for stealing a basket—I lived in Whitecross-street then—I hare been a witness on no other occasion—there is one other lodger in my house besides the shoemaker—there was no one in the room with me JOHN PLUMMER I am a cotton-manufacturer in Golden-lane Barbican in partnership with William Wilson This bag contains the description of cotton which I have at my manufactory—there are two doors to my store-room—one is locked the other is a door which men go to to fetch wool for consumption that is not locked—that door leads out to the stable—Jordan was in my employ as a confidential person—he went to the premises in Golden-lane every morning and evening and was trusted with a key which opened another gate where the horse and cart come into the premises and also the padlock of the store-room—Leonard is a wadding-manufacturer—he was in the habit of coming to our premises in Tower-street to buy waste but I never dealt with him at the manufactory—we never deal there at all—Baumer had been in the habit of coming there to fetch cotton when Leonard had purchased it—we never sell any thing at the factory of any description—the cotton in the bag is worth upwards of 2l Cross-examined Q Jordan has been in your service seven years A No he left for a short period—I suppose he was away about ten or twelve months—this cotton is not all the same—there are two sorts American and East Indian—I have the same description of cotton in my store-room and under the circumstances I swear to it—the key that was in Jordan s custody hung in the stable which he has the whole and sole power over—two or three others have access to the stable—I have three confidential servants in my manufactory—they do not wear fustian jackets of the description Jordan has—his is cord—I received information from Holbrook—Jordan was not apprehended that night—he came to work as usual in the morning SAMUEL HOLBROOK re-examined Jordan must have seen me seize the boy with the cotton HENRY PLUMMER I am the brother of John Plummer I was at the manufactory on the night of the 4th of December until half-past eight o clock—I fastened the premises up at half-past eight o clock which is the usual hour to leave—I left nobody on the premises—Jordan crossed the yard about ten minutes after eight o clock and I considered he was gone home—he did the horses up and I went to see the stable door fast—he came about half way across the yard to go home and I did not see him any more till next morning Cross-examined Q Had you known Holbrook any time A No— he stated something to me—I never saw him before that time which is two or three months ago—I never gave him any money and never promised him any COURT Q On a previous occasion had he given you some information A Yes and I told him if ever he saw any thing go out to stop it ROBERT DYER I am in the service of Mr Plummer On the 4th of December I left the factory with the foreman Henry Plummer—we both left together and locked the gate after us—I went back after the alarm was given and missed a considerable quantity of one sort of cotton and not so much of the other—I have looked at this cotton—there is more of one sort of cotton in this than another—I had seen the same sort of cotton on the premises—we lost this sort of cotton and in the same proportions as found in the parcel Cross-examined Q Had you known Leonard before A I saw him once before—I never saw his matter Q Did you not drink gin with Leonard next morning A I drank in the house in his presence not with him—I believe the officer paid for it—I had seen Leonard talking to our engineer that morning—there was no officer there then—I did not hear him ask any body why his boy was taken into custody—he was at the manufactory in Golden-lane—he came to ask why his boy was detained COURT Q Did you hear him make that inquiry A No I did not hear him speak—I had seen him once before in the court leading to the manufactory—I met him passing up the court or down I cannot say which MR CLARKSON Q Did not he make inquiry in your hearing why his boy was taken A No he did not JOHN HARDING I am a watchman of Cripplegate On the night of the 4th of December I took the boy Baumer with a bag of cotton on his back—he was given in charge by the witness—I asked where he was going with it—he said to Mr Leonard s his master—he said he had a note but believed he had dropped it—I said I must take you to the station-house —he dropped the cotton and said Then you may carry it yourself I shall not carry it —I took him to the station-house and gave him in charge of Woods—I did not tee any other person at the time—Holbrook gave him in charge Cross-examined Q You told him I suppose that it was stolen A I did not—I asked him where he got it from—he said from Golden-lane and that his master put it on his shoulder and that it was Mr Leonard ROBERT WOODS I produce the bag of cotton—I took Jordan into custody in Tower-street at his master s at ten o clock on the 5th of December—I took Leonard in Golden-lane about eight o clock—I found him in company with one of the prosecutor s servants—I believe he was an engineer—I did not hear what was passing between them Cross-examined Q Did not he say he came to inquire why his boy was in custody A Yes Jordan s Defence I went out of the factory at twenty-five minutes after even o clock and have witnesses to prove it—Mr Plummer s brothers as in the yard and if he likes to speak the truth he will say so THOMAS SINCLAIR I am a milkman I know the prisoner Jordan—about half-past eight o clock as near as I can guess on the evening of the 4th of December I was in Golden-lane—I went to the west end of the town and by the time I got from there it was half-past eight o clock—I had no clock or watch—I met Jordan in Golden-lane about that time—I went up to the top of the lane and stood talking to him a minute or two—we went into the Cock and had a pint of beer and stopped there till about nine o clock—I cannot say to exactly a minute I think as near as I can guess we were twenty minutes in the public-house—he was with me all the time—we parted when we left the public-house—I cannot say whether it had struck nine then or not COURT Q Did you know him before A I did—I did not know the name of the street he lived

t18350105-372  372 WILLIAM MERRIMAN was indicted for stealing on the 2nd of January 17lbs of mutton value 9s and 40lbs weight of fat value 13s the goods of Edward Spreckley his master and FRANCIS JENNER feloniously receiving the same knowing it to be stolen EDWARD SPRECKLEY I am a butcher and live in Albemarle-street The prisoner Merriman was in my employ for three weeks and he lived with me before—in consequence of information which I received before the 2nd of January I applied at the station-house for some policeman to watch my premises—some mutton and meat was produced to me at the station-house on the 2nd January—I am sure it is my property because I know the fat—I had missed a shoulder of mutton and a neck from the shop and some suet and fat—I know nothing of Jenner—I had seen the property safe the afternoon before—I knew the suet by its coming out of a particular bullock—it is very rich—we were obliged to put it to go away as fat and the mutton we know—it is scored in a particular way Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did you find any mutton in Jenner s house A We found 32lbs of fat but I could not swear to its being mine—I found 40 1/2 lbs of my fat at the station-house—that was different from the 32lbs —the fat was in a bad state—I asked the magistrate if I should take it to the tallow-chandler s—that was what we found in his house and the tallow-chandler has the money for him when it is applied for—the shoulder of mutton is here—I can identify that JOHN LINSDALE BEASTALL I am an apprentice to Mr Spreckley On Friday morning the 2nd of January I and the prisoner Merriman were in my master s shop from ten minutes before six o clock to about ten minutes after—we were left alone in the shop—Merriman asked me if I was going to have any coffee—I said I did not know—he came to me and said I will toss you for some —I tossed and won two cups of coffee which was 3d —he gave me a shilling to go and get it and pay for it—he told me to have mine at the coffee-shop and to pay for his—I went out to the coffee-shop by the Arcade in Piccadilly and had some coffee—I returned to the shop in about five minutes and saw him altering some shoulders of mutton changing the places where I had hung them—I said What are you changing them for —he made no reply and went out—he came back in about five minutes and in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes a person named Stone called and in consequence of what he said to me I examined the mutton and missed a shoulder—it had hung up in the part where he was altering them—I had hung it up myself—I saw that shoulder of mutton at Marl borough-street—I knew it by a mark on it—it is in Court—it was in its proper place in the shop when I tossed for the coffee and when I went out—it must have been removed in the five minutes I was absent and he was hanging up more fresh ones with the others when I returned Merriman The shoulder of mutton you say was missing was sold over-night Witness It was not—I hung up eight in the morning and I found only seven Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When you came home Merriman was doing something with the mutton and left the shop A Yes he went to have his coffee—I did not notice whether he took any thing with him—I know the mutton by having cut it off myself—it is cut as butchers generally cut it—I know it by the score—butchers do not all score them that way—very few of them do—I don t know any body that scores them as I do—it was scored when it was on the sheep—we cut it when the sheep is warm in order to make it appear fatter than it really is—here is a neck which I can also speak to—it is one of Mr Perkins s Southdown sheep—this neck is my scoring and was in the shop the night before—butchers all score them on the loin neck and down the shoulder COURT Q Have you any doubt of it being the mark you made A I have not a doubt of it MR CLARKSON Q Was the shoulder cut from this neck A No it is not—it belongs to the other side—Merriman helps me to kill sheep but I dress them always—I never saw Jenner GEORGE STONE police-constable C 99 In consequence of information I received I watched the shop of Mr Spreckley on the 2nd of January in the morning and a little before six o clock I saw the shop door open and two men come out—in a few minutes afterwards those two men came back with a cart—while the cart stood at the door I saw Jenner come down Albemarle-street with a basket under his arm—he crossed over Piccadilly and went towards the Green-park—he came back again and went up Albemarle-streetagain and looked into the shop-door—the cart was gone away then—he went half-way up the street crossed over and stood there for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour then went back to the shop and stood at the corner of Piccadilly—I went past him and saw the basket was empty except a cloth—he walked past the shop stood there a few minutes and while he was there I saw a boy come out of the shop—directly the boy got into Piccadilly the prisoner Jenner ran across the road into the shop with the basket under his arm—he came out without it and went towards Piccadilly—while he went towards Piccadilly I saw Merriman come out at the shop door and look up and down the street—he then went into the shop and came out with the basket full and a cloth over it—he placed it on the step of the next door and went to the shop door again—Jenner ran over to the shop door and had some conversation with him—then Merriman went inside the shop and Jenner went and took the basket from the door Q Jenner never left the street A He stood at the corner of the street and when the basket was brought out of the shop he was at the corner of the street—I followed and stopped him in Albemarle-street near Grafton-street—I asked him what he had got in the basket—he said Meat —I asked him where he got it—he said he bought it at Newport market and that he had just come from there—I said he had been and bought it very quick for I had seen him a few minutes ago in the street with such a basket—he said that I certainly had not—I then told him I saw the butcher bring it out and lay it on the step and he went and took it away—he

HAMBLIN I live in Westminster Tipling was my apprentice and Cord was my errand-boy for about eighteen months or two years I believe—he had left my service and was in trouble—I missed about 600 osiers and four hooks—these are some of the osiers and these fire-screens were made at Cord s house with my osiers—Tipling makes such things—these four hooks are mine and were found at Tipling s father s Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Where did these osiers come from A I bought them in Bishopsgate-street of Mr Clark—I can say they are mine from the manner in which they are prepared—I mean the splitting of them—I am a basket-maker—very few persons split their osiers at all they use them whole but I am in the fancy-business—I would not swear there is no one in London who makes fancy screens like these—I know these osiers by their colour—there are different colours and dies used—I believe my dies and colour are superior to any other—I live in Rupert-street—there is a Frenchman lives in Dean-street but he cannot produce such colours as mine—I have three apprentices—Robert Rook is the senior—I never suspected him of taking any of these things—it was not his business in particular to watch that—nothing was carried away—he will be out of his time in six or seven months—Tipling had learned the trade of making baskets—he is a pretty good-hand and is capable of doing the business all but staining the stuff—Rook s business was on the fancy-work and so were all the apprentices—they would learn the coarse work at the latter part of their time—I taught them the fine work and when I was not there the senior apprentice has instructed them—I began to miss osiers a month or six weeks ago—Tipling had before that wanted to see his indentures to know if he was rightly bound—I told him he and his father had seen them when he was bound—there was no dispute about it—my wife and him were not good friends—I do not see how they could be when he was always annoying her—I did not go to Bow-street nor did my wife—the prisoner said he went there and he told the Magistrate at Marlborough-street so but the Magistrate did not believe him—he said he had been because he did not believe he was properly bound and I said I was willing to go before any Magistrate to show the indentures to prove that he was—that was a week or a fortnight before I missed the osiers—he has frequently said he wished he was out of his time—I have never said I should be sorry as I thought he would be a rival—I went to his father s house—I saw the servant and asked her where Mr Tipling was—the officer and a journeyman of mine were with me—I sent the girl out for some gin—I asked her what she would take—she said what I pleased—I was in the room and when she was gone out I began to search and found these osiers concealed under the bedstead this is the bundle—when she came back I showed them to her—I did not abuse Tipling at that time—I have called him a vagabond—she did not say I had better give up his indentures—I did not reply No he knows the business too well he would take the victuals out of my plate nor any thing of the kind—I did not say Peggy you are a servant you should consider your own interest —I did not say I wanted to send him out of the country it is against my disposition—I did not tell her I would give her five pounds and a new suit of clothes if the would come and swear what I wanted her—I had no warrant but the Magistrate gave me leave to take my property—the girl said if she had known what I wanted she would have broken my head with the poker WILLIAM DRANE police-constable C 141 I went to Tipling s house in Tichbourne-street on the 6th of February—I followed the prosecutor he was in two or three minutes before me—I cannot tell where these osiers were found but he gave them to me in the room and said he found them under the bed—I was there when the girl had returned—I did not hear the prosecutor say any thing to her about getting Tipling out of the country or giving her five pounds—I afterwards went to Cord s lodging in Pulteney-court—I found these bundles of osiers concealed under the coals and these two screens hung up in the room Cross-examined Q You did not go into Tipling s room with the prosecutor A No—I went in two or three minutes—he could not have said much to the girl—this is the bundle of osiers the prosecutor found there—they were not done up quite so neat as they are now—I did not go to Rood s house—he told me he saw the prisoner take them but he did not tell me where I should find them—I went to Cord s house the same day that I went to Tipling s—I went to the room where I was told Cord lodged—I do not know who else lives in the house—these two screens were hanging in the room—Cord did not then say he had made them—he said others were concerned in it—he said before the Magistrate that Rook had been up at work in the room with them—he said that Rook was to teach them how to make them and brought the materials to the house and Tipling said the same before the Magistrate ROBERT ROOK I am an apprentice to the prosecutor On the 6th of February about eight o clock in the morning I saw Cord putting a lot of these osiers into his cap—they were split and ready for work—he put his cap under the bench and concealed it—he went to breakfast a few minutes afterwards and took his cap with him—on Saturday the 7th of February Tipling told me he had four hooks at home which he had taken away some time before—I told my master of it on the Monday Cross-examined Q Had your master lost a great many osiers A Yes I believe so but I only saw them taken that once—it was my business when I was there to take care of osiers—Tipling was there at the time they were taken—I live at No 7 Upper Rupert-street—they did not search my house—Cord lives in Pulteney-court—I had been there on the Sunday before and taken my coat and waistcoat to lend him—I only went just inside the door and gave them to a girl—my master and I do the finest work in the shop—the lads cannot do that—they begin with the coarsest work—Cord had nothing to do with screens in the shop— Tipling could do every part of the screen but he never did it in the shop—these are not nicely finished they are very rough work—I cannot tell whose work it is—it does not seem to be one who has had much practice—I never heard that Tipling and Cord said that I had been to teach them—I heard them say before the Magistrate that I took osiers there—Tipling has said he would do me all the injury he could because I gave him a month for stealing my shoes—he was always quarrelling and making what disturbance he could between his mistress and me—we were not the best of friends—he set us all in arms—he has threatened several times to leave my master and set up in business himself—I do not recollect that he said so in my master s presence—my mistress dies the goods—Cord splits them and my master s father and I have done them—I never went to Tipling s—I cannot tell where he lives—it is in the Edgeware-road—I never gave him any osiers to work up—when Cord took the osiers Charles Orton was there—I did not ask him to assist me in taking Cord s cap off—my matter was at Hammersmith at the time—I told my master when I saw him Witnesses for the Defence MARGARET PROCTOR I live servant with Tipling s father I was there with the children when the prosecutor came—he sent me for some gin—I asked about Joe—he said he was in prison—he said What do you wish for my dear if you wish for wine you shall have it —I said I had rather not —he said he wished to transport him—I spoke about his giving up his indentures—he said he would take the victuals out of his plate as he knew his business too well—he said he would make a lady of me if I swore against him as he said If I can get any one to swear against him for money I will do it —he gave me fourpence and sent me for a quartern of gin and when I came back he produced the osiers SOPHIA BROOK I am fifteen years of age I lodge in the next room to Cord—I have seen Rook come to Cord s lodging—he used to bring with him the things they make these screens with of all colours—I have seen him at work with Cord with what he brought CHARLES CORD I am Cord s brother I have seen Rook bring osiers to my brother—he taught my brother to make the screens and fine work—I have seen him there doing it—it is not above five weeks since he came there with a pair of frames to make screens COURT to MARGARET PROCTER Q Were you offered 5l to swear against the prisoner A Yes to say that I heard him say

t18350406-1056  1056 ANDREW CARROLL was indicted for stealing on the 1st of April 1 1/2 lb of worsted value 6s and 6 bobbins of silk value 7s the goods of Henry Woolcott his master and WILLIAM JOB was indicted for feloniously receiving the same well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute HENRY WOOLCOTT I live in Museum-street Bloomsbury The prisoner Carroll was in my employ for nearly four years—he was foreman and had nearly the whole management of my business—I did not know Job till I saw him at the station—I have heard Carroll mention his name and believe he knew him—I went to the station on the morning of the 1st of April at half-past seven o clock and saw this bobbin of silk and four hanks of worsted which are mine—the silk is worth 7s and the worsted about 6s —Job said it was not miner that he had bought the silk in St Martin s-lane and the worsted in Ropemaker-street—he was then in custody—I went home and said to Carroll How do you account for what I have seen at the station-house —he said he had taken 1 1/2 lb of worsted and 5 drams of silk and sold it to a poor man who was hard up—he had au-thority to sell my silk and worsted—he books the account of what he sells immediately but he had not booked this or any part of it nor has he paid me any money for it—he ought to pay it to my wife who is generally present—I asked him if he had entered this in the book—he said No Cross-examined by MR MAHON Q Do you receive money of Carroll A No my wife does—my book is here—I believe Job is a bell-pull manufacturer—I never saw him as a customer at my shop—I am out a great deal—I never left town for a month together—I had been away once for three weeks—I can swear to this worsted as being mine—I bought the wool in its pure state and had it dyed to these colours—it is part of two pads that I bought of a description that I never saw before nor since—there may be worsted made of as wool and the same brilliant dye—I had a character with Carroll—he was a good servant up to this time—he managed nearly all my business—I took stock four times a year—our stock was increasing—we were taking stock at the time I discovered this Q Was it Carroll s habit to enter every little trifle at the moment A Yes he ought to do it—if I saw him leave the book I called him back to enter the articles—if the book had been made up in the evening I should have been satisfied—these things were taken in the morning—he said be had sold these articles to a poor man who would call and pay in a day or two and he would not enter them till they were paid for COURT Q Whether that stuff be finer than your neighbour s or better or worse are there other circumstances which enable you to swear to this A Yes there is a peculiarity about the wool and the colour MR MAHON Q Did I not understand you that silk and worsted of the same dye and in every way as fine and good as this may be had at other shops in London A Yes but I never saw exactly the same description of wool as this—it is coarse Scotch wool—I had it on trial from Haddon and Co —they were the only two pads they had—I have never seen the same sort as this—the prisoner sells in my shop but never outside—if he had sold any thing he ought to have put it in the book MRS WOOLCOTT I am the wife of the prosecutor Carroll always pays me the money he receives for goods—he never paid me for these—it would have been his duty to have done it—it U not his practice to sell outside the house Cross-examined Q Are you in the habit of attending the shop A Yes—when goods are sold on credit Carroll did not pay me for them till they were paid for—I have seen Job at the shop I think six or seven times in the last twelve months—he came to purchase articles there—he is a bell-rope maker I believe and for that business he would require such articles as these—Carroll never took articles to supply his private friends and paid for them out of his wages—I never knew it nor did my husband ever speak to me about it—I am always in the shop—Carroll had the entire management of the retail business—we have a good many customers in a day but he ought to enter every article as it is sold if several customers are in the shop—I do not remember any article being sold by eight o clock in the morning and not entered by three o clock in the afternoon—I have said to him You have forgotten to enter such and such articles which have been sold —Job sometimes bought half a pound or three quarters of a pound of worsted—I never saw him buy silk—we do not allow silk to be sold except to persons that work for us—no persons in our business have bought silk of us—I do not think I should let any fringe-manufacturer have any silk—when Job has come to our shop I have called Carroll to serve him—I think Job has not made any purchase that I have not seen—our business was increasing—I cannot say whether the stock was increasing—I never complained to my husband of the deficiency of any articles—I never had reason to suspect that I had lost any thing through Carroll GEORGE ATKINS police-constable E 103 On the morning in question I was on duty in Museum-street and saw Carroll come out of the prosecutor s shop but before then in going up Museum-street I had seen the prisoner Job coming up Hart-street—as soon as he saw me he turned back again—I went two or three doors past Hart-street and pretended to be looking in at a window—I saw Job run very nimbly across Museum-street into Castle-street—I then turned back to watch him—I had seen him frequently before every morning when I was on duty there for nearly a fortnight—I saw him turn round the corner of Duke-street—I stood there a few minutes and my sergeant came—I told him I was watching Job—I then waited till I saw Carroll come out of Duke-street and go to the prosecutor s shop—he staid in there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he then came out with each side of his bosom very full of something and his hat so full that he could hardly keep it on his head—he had nothing exposed it was all concealed—I passed close by him he me the time of the morning and said it was a fine morning and I said the same—I went to the corner of Duke-street and he went there too—I crossed the road and stood there and presently I saw Job come peeping round the corner of Vine-street—I cast my eyes to the right and saw Carroll beckon with his head and Job went over to him—Carroll went on to his house No 23 Duke-street and Job followed him in—I then watched till I saw Carroll come out with apparently nothing in his bosom nor yet in his hat—I waited three or four minutes and Job came out of the house with this bundle of blue worsted under his arm this red worsted in his hat and this bobbin of silk in his waistcoat pocket Cross-examined Q Did you know that Carroll was foreman to Mr Woolcott A I knew he was servant there—I knew be lived at No 23 Duke-street—I have never seen him come to Woolcott s door and deliver parcels to customers—I did not know where Job lived then—I never saw him in Mr Woolcott s shop—I had never spoken to Job any more than bid him good morning—I did not follow Carroll into the house—I cannot swear that Job had nothing in his pocket when I saw him first this morning he might have had this silk and worsted—I did not search him till I got him to the station-house DANIEL MOBBS I am a police-sergeant I was at the station-house and found the property on Job as has been described—I found some bobbins of silk at his house Cross-examined Q Did you search Carroll s house A Yes I found nothing there that was claimed by the prosecutor—what I found at Job s house were mere trifles Carroll s Defence When Job had these things there was no felonious intent they are to be bought at any shop in London Job s Defence On the morning in question I went to ask for credit for a little worsted to execute an order for a gentleman in Tottenham-court-road—I thought if I could see Carroll I would ask him for half-a-crown instead of getting credit—I saw him come out—I went to him and said Do you think your master would trust me for a little worsted as I am quite out of money —I asked him to let me go into his house and he got me these things—I was not conscious but that his master knew it Thomas Ryley Bain bridge-street St Giles s Owen M Dermott Salamanca-place Lambeth Barnard Riley Rosemary-place and Patrick Foley St Andrew s-hill gave Carroll a good character and George Liddiard Pump-alley William Salter Payne-street Islington and James Hargood of Golden-lane gave Job a good

indicted for feloniously receiving the said goods well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution JOHN NICHOLLS police-constable N 171 In the afternoon of the 18th of March at five o clock I saw the prisoner Dunn with a pocket of hops on his head on a knott—Messrs Barlow Gills and White s premises are in the Maze in Tooley-street and Rutter s premises are about 200 yards from them—Dunn came out of the Maze and went down Mill-lane where Rutter s premises are—when he got to Rutter s gate he put the pocket of hops down—I went up to him and asked him where he brought them from —he said from Messrs Barlow Gill and White s and if I wished he would go back with me to the warehouse—I said he might if he liked—and he took up the hops and went with me—when we got to Messrs Barlow s ware-house he called Lloyd to the door and Grubb came out with him—Dunn said The policeman has stopped me with these hops are they not all right —Lloyd said They are all right and he pulled this piece of paper out of his pocket read — March 18 1835 Mr Butter Please to receive one po repack from T Saxby —I then went back with Dunn to Rutter s premises as I was not quite satisfied—Dunn took the hops and I followed him—I saw Rutter come out of a public-house opposite his premises—Dunn put the hops against the gate—Ratter took out the key opened the gate and went in—Dunn put the hops inside the gate—I asked Mr Rutter if he received these hops—he said Yes I do for I paid 7l 10s for them —I said For how many —he appeared confused and gave me no direct answer but said he had had a deal of trouble with our men before—I then spoke to Bride a police-constable told him to take charge of the hops not to let them go away—I then went to the prosecutor s counting-house in High-street Borough near the Town-hall—I saw Mr White and Saxby there—from what I learned I went back to the warehouse—I went from there to the Red Man public-house and found Rutter and Lloyd in conversation in the parlour—I asked Lloyd what quantity of hops there were in the bag that he had just sent out—he refused to give me any answer—I told him I had seen Mr White it was my duty to prosecute this inquiry and I was determined to know—he hesitated some time and then said Seven pounds —I again asked him for how many hops—he said he did not know for Grubb had weighed them and Grubb was only at the warehouse—I asked him to go over there with me and show me the entry and let me know the weight of them—we went and Lloyd called Grubb—I asked Grubb what was the weight of the hops he had sent out—after some hesitation he said 1 cwt 1 qr 191bs —I asked him if he had made the entry and said I should like to see it —he turned to look at the slate and then he looked at several pieces of paper that were lying on the desk then all on a sudden he ran up the ladder—at that time Lloyd left me—Grubb remained up stairs about a minute and he came down with this piece of paper in his hand with 1 cwt 1 qr 19lbs upon it—I said You have just done this it is wet and I smeared the writing—I then went over to the Red Lion where I saw Lloyd and Rutter again—I called the officer Morgan and I gave them into his custody—I then went back to the warehouse to look for Grubb and gave him to an officer—I then went back to the Red Lion and took Dunn in the tap-room—I weighed the pocket of hops—it weighs 1 cwt 1 qr 26lbs bare weight— the scales just on the balance deducting seven pounds for the weight of the pocket the net weight would be 1 cwt 1 qr 19lbs Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q You do not know the usage of the trade A No certainly not—I examined the scales at the ware-house and the weights that were in them were 1 cwt 1 qr 191bs —Lloyd was the warehouseman I understood—I do not know whether it is his duty to weigh things himself—he was present during some of the conversation between me and Grubb but I do not recollect that he joined in it—he said they had been weighed by Grubb Cross-examined by MR CRESSWELL Q How were you dressed A In my uniform—if Rutter had done any thing wrong he would have known by my dress that I was a policeman—he must have known me for he made the remark that he had been troubled with our men before—he said he had received the hops and had paid 7l 10s for them but he did not say he had bought hops of Saxby and that these might be them—he did not mention Saxby s name—he said he had bought the hops for 7l 10s —I saw Saxby in the counting-house and he went across with me to the warehouse and then to the Red Lion—after the hops had been taken back the second time I left the hops there and Rutter at large but I left Bride with the hops—I do not know whether Rutter could have removed the hops in spite of Bride—Rutter opened the gates in my presence and said he received the hops—I did not assist in carrying them into the gateway WILLIAM ROBINSON WHITE I am one of the firm of John Barlow Gill and White—we are hop-merchants—our counting-house is near the Town-hall and our warehouse in the Maze—Lloyd was our foreman and Dunn one of the porters—I did not know Rutter but by name—when hops arrived from the country the side of the pocket is cut open and a quantity of hops are taken out which are trimmed into a form called a sample and the hops which are cut away from the sample constitute a quality which are again put in pockets and called repacks—this is a custom perfectly well known in the trade—Mr Thomas Saxby was a customer of ours and was in the habit of purchasing repacks of us—on the first of February he purchased eight pockets of repacks which were numbered according to the custom of our trade one to eight inclusive and I gave instructions that Saxby was to have the repacks and I ordered the man to deliver them to Saxby s order—the pocket of hops in question does not fall within the numbers from one to eight—I am not aware that there is any written order from Saxby for the delivery of these hops—I know that three of the pockets of repacks had been delivered and that there are five more remaining—Saxby certainly had no authority to sell any of our hops—the pocket in question had never been sold to Saxby—I had never given orders to deliver any hops to Rutter—it is not unusual to send hops out on a man s head—a slate is kept in the warehouse to make rough entries on and then they are entered in the book—the weight of the hops is not put down on the slate—we have regular books for that COURT Q If I understand you rightly this particular pocket of hops forms no part of those sold to Saxby A Certainly not and no servant of ours had any authority to deliver them to Saxby—Rutter was no customer of ours Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Had you a clerk of the name of Heath A Yes—I do not recollect that Rutter in my presence paid Heath 16l 8s 6d for hops—I will not swear that it has not been done—I know that Rutter and Saxby had dealings for hops—I have not given a verbal order that Saxby might have what hops he pleated out of our place—I have given a written order that he might have the repacks—I have no means of knowing whether Saxby had given Rutter authority to have what hops he pleased out of our place—if Saxby wanted any hops be could come to me and buy them and I should give him a written order Q Had not Mr Saxby the power of sending either verbally or by what other means he pleased for that stock of hops on your premises A Yes certainly there was no occasion for seeing any of the parties he would be entitled to have them on his own verbal order THOMAS SAXBY On the 11th of February I purchased eight pockets of repacks of Messrs Barlow and Co —I do not know that they were numbered from one to eight for I had not seen them till I went to the ware-house to see if the remainder were there—I had sold three of the pockets of repacks one on the 14th of February to Chittenden and two to Rutter one on the the 27th of February and one on the 7th of Match—I have not sold him any since then—I told Lloyd to let Rutter have more hops of mine of the repacks at 5l 5s per hundred if be paid for them but I never authorized him to let Rutter have any other hope only those five pockets of mine—my five pockets are left in the warehouse now—I do not know any thing of this one—no part to this order looking at it is my writing—I saw my five remaining pockets of repacks in the warehouse on the 19th of March—I do not remember that I had seen Rutter for several days before that—the last money I received for him was 7l 10s at Lloyd s on the 7th of March—I have not received any other money from him—I have a list to the numbers of repacks which are left at Messrs Barlow s for me—their numbers are 1 2 3 5 7 numbers 8 6 4 had been disposed of Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q You had several dealings with Mr Rutter A Yes and Lloyd was to let him have any of my repacks—if Lloyd had sent out any other hops than those I mentioned it was not by my authority—Rutter may have had loose hops from me as well as hops in pockets THOMAS HEATH I am in the employ of Messrs Barlow and Co I remember Saxby purchasing on the 11th of February eight pockets of repacks—I understand they were numbered from 1 to 8 —it is my business to know when the sale is made and to communicate it to Lloyd the foreman—Lloyd would know these repacks—he had no authority to take any other but these repacks for Saxby COURT Q How would Lloyd know which were Saxby s hops A He would know what hops had been weighed off for Saxby—they were weighed by the warehouseman and entered in the weight book—it would be Lloyd s duty to enter them—here is the book—here is the entry of eight pockets sold to Saxby in my own handwriting—I believe the copy this was taken from was in Lloyd s writing but the paper after the entry is made is destroyed—I cannot undertake to say who brought me the paper Q But supposing there were two hundred pockets of hops in the ware-house and Lloyd was called upon to deliver a portion of the hops sold to Saxby how was he to know which were Saxby a hops A It is his duty to know where they were placed—he would know by the numbers—he would have the paper to refer to and he could refer to his own recollection—he had a book in which the sale of repacks were entered MR CLARKSON Q Is Lloyd the person who had charge of every thing A Yes it is his business to keep an account of what is delivered and to deliver what is ordered—this is the memorandum of what was sold to Saxby—Lloyd would enter in his book an account of what had been sold Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Is that book at home A Yes I believe it is—we have several warehouses—at that time we had only three—perhaps at the present time there are 8000 pockets of hops and repacks in our warehouses—it is not impossible in such a number for a man to make a mistake JOHN BRIDE police-constable M 148 I was called by Nicholls to take charge of some hops at Rutter s gate—I produce the hops here to-day—after Nicholls had left Rutter said to me It is all right —I said I had no doubt of it—he said when he was an apprentice all these cuttings were the perquisites of the men—I said no more but he said he had bought them of Messrs Barlow Gill and White on the 7th of March—he did not mention the name of Saxby at all to me—here is the pocket—there is no mark on it Cross-examined by MR CRESSWELL Q Who began this conversation A Rutter—I stated at Union Hall that he said the cuttings were the perquisites of the men when he was an apprentice JOHN M CRAW police-sergeant M 15 I was at Union Hall on the examination of Grubb but it was not in presence of the prisoners—I received 4l from Grubb out of his box and 3l which I saw given to him by Mrs Roach MARY ANN ROACH I keep the Red Lion in the Maze On the evening of the 18th of March Grubb borrowed 3l of me—it was my money Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Do you know Rutter A I have seen him pay money to Lloyd on account of Saxby on two occasions COURT Q How do you know it was on account of Saxby A I heard Mr Rutter say so MR CLARKSON Q When was the last time you saw that A I really cannot tell you—it might be a month or two months before I lent the 3l to Grubb COURT Q Where was it this conversation passed A It was one day paid on the bar and another day in the parlour—there might be a third transaction but I do not remember it JOHN GRUBB a prisoner I was in the service of Messrs Barlow Gill and White as porter—Lloyd was the foreman of the warehouse where I worked—Dunn was my fellow-porter there in September last Lloyd Dunn and I came to an agreement to keep the sweepings of the warehouse all together—I had seen Rutter on the subject of these sweepings several times and on the morning of the 18th of March I saw him going by the warehouse—I do not think Lloyd had come from breakfast—I do not believe he came in then—Rutter said he wanted the sweepings on that day—this pocket is vhat we call sweepings—he was to give 3d or 4d per pound—that is the usual selling price of these hops—Rutter said he wanted them in as soon as possible—I told him we had got no empty pockets—he said Come down and I will give you two —I went and he gave me two—he and Lloyd were present when this pocket was packed in the store-room—Mr Saxby s five pockets of repacks were in the bottom floor of the warehouse—Lloyd certainly knew that these were to go out as Sax-by s property—Lloyd said he should write anote in Saxby s name—this is the note he wrote reads — Mr Rutter Please to receive one pocket of repacks from T Saxby —they were to be delivered and this note was to have been sent with them but it was not for they went off before the note was written—they were to have been sent in Saxby s name as hops had been sent before to Rutter s Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You made several statements on this subject I believe A Yes at Union Hall—Saxby has in my hearing given orders to Lloyd to let Rutter have hops—Lloyd did not pay me for the hops—I said he did—there are many untruths told Q Why did you tell an untruth A To escape detection all of us and I included Q Upon your oath is it not to escape conviction and punishment that you are now telling what you are A Yes Q Did you care who was punished if you escaped A Yes—I never gave King s evidence before that I swear—I remember a cast of arson at which I was present—that was at Northampton in the year 1830—I was not taken up—I was never accused of being a party—I was a witness for the prosecution on that occasion—I received 10l for that case of arson—for giving evidence and my trouble—I never boasted of it—I know a man named Edwards—I dare say I have mentioned to him that I had received the 10l —I cannot tell how long it is ago—it may be twelve months or two years ago—I do not keep such things in my head—I did not remember it when you first asked me—Edwards is not employed in the warehouse now—he left twelve months ago last March—Lloyd did not pay me any money for these hops Q Did you not say he had and that you put the money into your box A Yes but it was not true—I was advised by my friends to turn King s evidence—some professional gentlemen had been to the prison to see me—Mr Robinson has been and Mr Warner—the man against whom I gave evidence against in the case of arson was hung COURT Q Was there a reward for the conviction of the party A Yes 500l —my father got 50l and I got 10l MR CLARKSON Q How long have you been in the service of Messrs Barlow and Co A About four seasons since this trial at Northampton the 10l which I received was for giving evidence—I spoke the truth then—I was never charged with participating in that fire—my father was constable at that time—I was not apprehended—I assisted my father on that occasion—I was a witness in consequence of something that I heard the prisoner say at the blacksmith s shop COURT Q Were you an accomplice A No and I was not accused of being one ROBERT TAYLOR I acted as clerk to the Justices at Union-hall at the examination of the prisoners—the statements were made but the prisoners refused to sign them—I took the depositions on the night of the 18th—this is a faithful transcript of what they said—I took it myself—I tendered it to them to sign Rutter said he could not do so without his attorney would allow it Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q You say these were taken from the prisoner s mouth A He did not say all this from beginning to end as it appears here—the Magistrate put questions to him and they are not down—what he said in answer to the questions I have made into a narrative—an answer might be one of explanation—I did not take down what I did not think essential—he was perhaps three or four minutes under examination —he said all that I have taken down—he might have said a little more which I did not take MR CLARKSON Q Did you take it down in presence of the Magistrate A Yes and he authenticated it read The prisoner Lloyd says I agreed with Rutter to-day about the hops—he came to the warehouse about them soon after dinner—he said what he generally says I want some cuttings two or three hundredweight—the agreement was made—some time past Mr Saxby allowed me to let Rutter have cuttings at five guineas per hundredweight—the cuttings were ware-housed at Messrs Barlow Gill and White s—I do not keep the account of cuttings I sell for Mr Saxby there is a slate kept for that purpose—a young man named Ling takes it from the slate into a book—I have been paid for the hops—I have had 7l and he told me he would bring 10s more—I sold the hops at the rate of five guineas per hundredweight—I did not care whether I had the 10s or not because I knew I had not given the full value of hops for the money—I do not know how much went out—I gave instruction to Grubb to weigh it—I understood there was one hundred-weight one quarter nineteen pounds—there was a deduction of six or seven pounds to be made from that for the pocket—I was to account to Mr Saxby for the money—I received the 7l in gold this day The prisoner Rutter says I have been in the habit of purchasing hops of Mr Saxby—I agreed about the hops a few days since when I paid down 7l —I was to have a hundred and a half of hops for that—I saw Lloyd today—I told him to send me the hops—I agreed with Mr Saxby about the price—I had some cuttings on the 7th of March—Mr Saxby owes me about 10s which I have overpaid Taken before me this 28th day of March 1835 JAMES TRAIL Rutter s Defence The first transaction I had with Saxby was in January 1834—I then purchased hops to the amount of £1 000 since then I have bought hops of him for which Lloyd received the money and accounted to Saxby David Edwards a coal-dealer Evan Evans tailor and draper Stephen Danby builder Crosby-row John Jones dairyman Swan-alley Coleman-street the Rev John Tudor Rowland James Ball a cabinet-maker James Preston shoemaker

flour there—he said I know there has been some flour brought here I came with it —I know this sack by the mark—it is mine and is worth 3s 6d —here are 1421bs of flour in it which is worth 1l 4s to me—I had flour of the same sort JOHN GEORGE I keep a cook-shop in St John-street Brick-lane Last Thursday night between eight and nine o clock I saw Johnson the prisoner close against my truck in a passage about thirty yards from the prosecutor s I went to him—he told me not to crack a weed—he said We want to get a bit of flour out —I told him I would not allow him—I went in and bolted the door—soon afterwards I saw a man go out of the alleygate with a sack half full—Whitelock then came to me and told me not to say any thing I said I would not see it done—I said You have broken my lock off —he said I will make that good —they were obliged to break that to get out—I went afterwards to Mr Edmonds and what he has stated is correct Johnson Q Did you see me take any flour A I could not swear to the man that took it but you two were iu the alley and when the sack was gone there was nobody but Whitelock there HARRIET COUCH I am the wife of Robert Couch we keep a beer-shop in Virginia-row About nine o clock that night three young men came in together and one of there brought this sack of flour on his back—the prisoners are two of the men—they staid drinking about an hour—I saw the sack in the room after they were gone—Mr Edmonds and Whitelock and the officer came afterwards and took away the sack—it was the same that the prisoners and the other person had left they had had some ale which they did not pay for—they went to the door and I thought they were coming back—Johnson remained longer than the others Johnson She swore at the office that I did not go Into the house with the others but I came in afterwards Witness No I said you staid afterwards JOHN BRUIFF I was in the prosecutor s service I know Whitelock and have seen Johnson about the lane—I remember the day this flour was taken—Whitelock asked me to give it him over the wall and I did—I have been allowed to turn King s evidence—Whitelock said a person named Tom was waiting over the wall—we took it out of the yard Whitelock He asked me to get the flour if I had not been tipsy I should not have done it Witness He was not tipsy ROBERT BACKHOUSE police-constable H 92 On this Thursday night I went to the prosecutor s and he gave Whitelock into custody he said if his master would forgive him he would tell all about it but he said he would give him in charge—Whitelock said he would take me to the place where it was—in going along he said he had long wished to go to sea and now he should go at His Majesty s expense—I went to Mrs Couch and asked her if any flour had been brought there she said No —I said Are you sure of that —she said Yes —Whitelock then said Yes Mrs Couch there is —she then said It is in the back room —I got another officer and took Whitelock—I then found Johnson Whitelock I did not mention her name I said Yes there is JOHN BROOKES police-constable H 64 I received the property and have the sack WILLIAM HERITAGE I am clerk to the Magistrates at Worship-street This is Mr Broughton s signature to this deposition read —the prisoner Johnson says I was drinking in the Hare public-house—I went into the yard and saw two men standing one of them said I have got a bit of flour that I want to get out —I said I know nothing about it —while I was talking Mr George came to ask what we were doing there and I said This man wants to put some flour out Johnson s Defence I was in the Hare public-house and went into the yard I saw two men there one of them they brought to the station-house but let him go again—he carried the flour out—I asked him what they were going to do—he said To get some flour out —I said I had nothing to do with it —I went into the house and sat there half an hour—I then went out and saw the same men they asked me to have something to drink—they took me to the Loggerheads—they then took me into the beer-shop but they said nothing about the robbery—they then went away—I sat there a bit and was coming home when Mr George and some other people stopped me WHITELOCK— GUILTY Aged 19 — Transported for Seven Years JOHNSON— GUILTY Aged 24 — Confined Six Months 
t18350511-1231a  1231 GEORGE MUNDAY was indicted for stealing on the 25th of February 12lbs of soap value 5s 8lbs of bacon value 3s 6lbs of sugar value 5s and 1 1b of tea value 5s the goods of Samuel Lilley his master MR PHILLIPS conducted the Prosecution HENRY DAVID WEST I was in the service of Mr Lilley on the 25th of February—the prisoner was his shopman—early that morning as we were getting up he asked me to lend him my box I brought it down stairs and when I opened the shop he said I wish you would pack these things for me and he brought me four bars of soap the bacon and the other things mentioned in this indictment he told me they were for himself and I packed them in my box as he desired me—he then told me to carry them to Mr Enever s a gardener who lives about a quarter of a mile down the lane—I asked him whether they were set down—he told me they were—I took them and left them as he desired me at Mr Enever s Cross-examined by MR JONES Q What are you A An apprentice I have been there two years and three months—my time was not out—I left Mr Lilley in consequence of his suspecting I was engaged in this transaction—he had charged me with pilfering once before—I had given a shilling in change by mistake and he thought I had done it wilfully—he asked me where the shifting was I said I did not know I thought it was in the till—the prisoner and I have been good friends—he never hit me but once—we have quarrelled once or twice—I cannot tell how many times he has scolded me for being lazy and not attending to my work but it was not very often—I never said I would be revenged on him nor any thing of the kind—I have been to the Coach and Horses I never lunched there but once—I have been there when my friends have come to see me they have put their horse there—the prisoner has not said I was doing very wrong to go there so often and that he was sure I was spending money that was not my own—I came to town with Mr Lilley and when we came be charged me with this and I was taken to prison for a week—I cannot tell why I was not committed—I did not agree to give evidence against the prisoner at Union-ball—I never denied the charge—Mr Lilley asked me whether I packed the things up and I said Yes by the prisoner s direction—I was under the prisoner s orders—I was not asked if I would come and give evidence against the prisoner—I was asked what I knew about it and stated as I have now that I acted under hit orders—I was then liberated on bail—I do not recollect that any thing was said to me about giving evidence—I was not in the habit of sending my box to town I had never sent it—I know Mr Wiltshire I never sent my box to him for myself—I had taken a box to Mr Wiltshire for the prisoner MR PHILLIPS Q How often had you sent this box to town A Twice by the prisoner s direction—I never sent it without COURT Q Does your master deal in these things A Yes the prisoner brought them to me to pack up—I asked him if they were put down—he said Yes —my matter was ill at the time JAMES ENEVER I am a gardener and live at Walthamstow On the 25th of February the box was brought to my house but I was not at home—the prisoner came there afterwards—he stopped his horse and cart and asked the girl for the box—she went to give it him but could not get it from under the table—my wife asked me to give it into the cart which I did—Godfrey wat in the cart with the prisoner—the box did not appear to be empty GEORGE GODFREY I am fourteen years old—I remember going with the prisoner to London on the 25th of February—he stopped at Mr Enever s and said Where is that box I am to take to town —Mr Enever gave it him in the cart—we came to town—he drove over London-bridge—he put the horse and cart up took me further on and left me at a public-house and he took the box on his shoulder—I stayed at the public-house three-quarters of an hour—he then came back with the box empty on his shoulder—he gave it to me and I put it into the cart by his direction—he told me not to say any thing about his putting the horse and cart up—I afterwards gave the box to Mr Enever s boy—I had noticed when Mr Enever gave the box that it was heavy for I could not lift it Cross-examined Q Had you ever been to London before A Yes but not with the prisoner—never to buy goods for his master—he brought some that day SAMUEL LILLEY I am a tallow-chandler grocer and cheesemonger and live at Walthamstow The prisoner was in my service and was discharged on the 27th of February from something I had heard—I went to an officer and on Monday the 2nd of March I went to No 9 New-street Southwark the prisoner s wife and child his mother and brother were there I saw the officer find this soap and he took from a closet one piece of sugar and in a corner of the room he found another piece of sugar covered with dirty linen—when the prisoner entered my service he stated himself to be single and that hu had lived in that character before—I never doubted it—he came to me on the 20th of October—I had sent him to London on the 25th of February to purchase goods—in going from my house to the lodgings in New-street it is necessary to go over London or Blackfriars-bridge Cross-examined Q You would not venture to swear that any of these articles belong to you A Yes I would to the soap—I have sugar here which corresponds with what we found at the lodgings—I can swear to the soap by the make it is yellow—I had not seen any of the persons I saw at the lodgings before to my knowledge—I have seen them since when I was endeavouring to apprehend the prisoner with the officer—there are a great many complexions of soap—this was in a box wrapped in blue paper and some of the paper adhered to the soap—another tradesman might have put his soap in blue paper but it should have been a very rare thing that it should be the same coloured paper—the alkali would take the colour out and put a colour in Q Did not the prisoner offer to give himself up when you spoke to him about this A No I had some suspicion on the Monday after this took place but not enough to apprehend any man upon—and he came to me to know if I had any thing to say against him I said Munday I am afraid I shall have —he promised to meet me at his father s home in Bishopsgate-street at three o clock that day I went there and waited till nine o clock and he did not come—I did not go to town with him at the time he came to me because I had another person to take and I wished to search his lodging though I did not tell him so—I discharged my apprentice also as I had been in the counting-house and seen him take a shilling and when I went to look for it it was not there but it was explained and the man came back and brought the shilling and said he had it by mistake among the halfpence which he had given him—I had him examined at Union-hall on this business and he was remanded for another examination but he was never committed—I did not ask him to come and give evidence against the prisoner the Magistrate bound him over MR PHILLIPS Q Had you had some accident A Yes a horse fell with me and knocked my knee all to pieces the prisoner came to my bed side to receive orders he was my principal shopman the other is only a lad—here is no entry of these goods in the book Prisoner Q Was I to enter them if they were sold for ready money A No COURT Q Do you permit your servants to pack goods in a box and send them away without booking them A No of course not I am speaking of the counter-trade but if such articles as these were sold for ready money of course the prisoner should book them MR JONES Q How long were you ill A I think between a fortnight and three weeks but I used to get down into the room where I could see the transaction of business—my wife was there and my sister—the prisoner had the whole charge of the counter—the apprentice was to clean things and take things out—he has sold things but the prisoner was there and he acted under his direction—I have blamed the prisoner for letting the apprentice serve MR PHILLIPS Q How soon after the prisoner had made an appointment to meet you in London did you take him A It was on the 2nd of March he appointed to meet me and I was not able to take him till the 20th of April—I was looking for him and so were the officers of Union Hall MR PHILLIPS to HENRY DAVID WEST Q Did the prisoner ever mention New-street to you A Yes in the course of conversation he said his brother lived there—I am quite certain he told me these articles were booked Cross-examined Q You brought the box down and packed the goods in A Yes he brought them for me out of the shop—I packed them in the warehouse on my master s premises JOHN NEWCOMBE I am an officer of Union Hall I went in search of the prisoner to New-street—I found his mother and wife theft—I found these cakes of soap there and this sugar—the prisoner said before the Magistrate that the box he brought from Mr Enever s contained nothing but his own wearing apparel Prisoner s Defence I am entirely innocent—I borrowed the apprentice s box to take my own things to my mother s and I brought it back—I know nothing about these things—I gave myself up to Mr Lilley directly Mr Wiltshire told me of the charge—my not meeting him at three o clock that day was my not seeing Mr Enever and the next morning I heard my mother was in custody—I went to a solicitor who advised me to stay out of the way which I did but I did not hide myself—West knows he put the things into the box HENRY DAVID WEST No I put nothing but the goods into it—there was no black coat nor any shoes JURY Q Were you authorised to examine the books A No not after Munday SAMUEL LILLEY West had no authority to examine the books—if he sold any thing he might put it down GUILTY Aged 24 — Transported for Seven Years

t18350511-1289  1289 SAMUEL SILK was indicted for stealing on the 22d of April 4 unfinished hats value 2l the goods of Thomas Christy and others his masters and MARK MARKS and JAMES DAVIES for feloniously receiving the same well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c EDWARD JACKSON I am foreman to Mr Thomas Christy and others hat-manufacturers in Gracechurch-street The manufactory is in Bermondsey-street—Silk was in their employ for about six months—I discovered a deficiency in the stock of hats about three months ago—I know the other two prisoners Marks is a hat-manufacturer in High-street St Giles s and Davies is his foreman—in consequence of information I went in company with a policeman to the house of Marks on the 4th of May he was not at home—I saw Davies at the end of Crown-street—I had been to the house and inquired for Davies—a shopman went to look after him and he came to me at the end of Crown-street which is at the corner of High-street—I asked him if he knew two persons who I named—he said he knew them and asked me what was the matter—I told him they were in a little trouble and asked him if the two persons I named had been there selling some hats to Mr Marks—he said No not at all —he said that he and Marks did not do any thing in that way for he would not allow it—I told him he must tell me the truth and said I had heard that they had—he then said they had not been there for the last three or four months—I asked him to let me look at the quality-marks of their hats which is a ferrit mark inside—he said he could not do that—I saw Marks the same evening in company with Davies at the door of a coffee-shop—I asked Marks whether any persons had been to him selling him some hats—he said Yes he had bought hats of them—I asked him if he would allow mo to look at the stuff-hats in his shop—he said yes he had no objection—he said he did not trouble his head about the quality-marks—in crossing to his shop he said he always gave nine or ten-shillings and upwards according to the quality—we went into the shop—Marks and Davies went to the other end of the shop whispering together—we all three went into a parlour adjoining the shop—a hat was produced—I did not know it—he brought ten more hats afterwards which I knew—they have various marks upon them by which I knew them and likewise the quality-mark—a constable was with me—when I recognised the first hat I gave a signal and the constable came in—I gave them all to the constable—I went again on the 11th of May with the same policeman and found three hats which I knew and took away—they were in the usual state for sale trimmed Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did not Davies say he could not let you look at the stock as his master was away A He did not say any thing of the kind—when I saw Marks he made no objection—I did not look over four or five dozen hats—they brought them to me—I suppose they brought thirty to me—they had a good stock—if Marks had any idea that the three last hats had been improperly come by he had a week to get rid of them JOHN M CRAW I am a policeman I went to Mark s shop with Jackson—they produced a great many hats—I brought away eleven of them and have them here—I asked Marks if he knew Silk and Allden—he stated that he did he had bought hats of them—that the last he bought of Silk was about a fortnight before—he had known Silk for a number of years and considered him a manufacturer of hats and Allden his man and he had given 9s 6d or 10s each for them—among the eleven hats there were two holes in the crown of one—I said to Davies Is that a regular way to purchase a hat of a manufacturer —he said no he did not know that it was and it had been done with steaming—I went again the second day and got three more hats Cross-examined Q Jackson was with you and heard all that passed A Yes JOHN BROWN I am a cab-proprietor About three weeks ago I was at London-bridge stand about half-past seven o clock in the evening on the Surrey side—Silk and Allden came to engage my cab—I did not know them before—I am quite certain of them—they got into my cab and told me to go to the end of Crown-street St Giles s—they had a small bundle in a handkerchief—Silk carried it—I took them to the end of Crown-street—Silk got out of the cab and went into Mark s shop—Allden continued in the cab and asked me to have something to drink—Silk came out of the shop several times and at last came into the cab again—he had no bundle then—they went to a dram-shop in Tottenham-court-road—I had something to drink with them—they continued there about four hours—it was twelve o clock when I got home—we were not drinking all that time—he went several times backwards and forwards to Mark s shop—we went to another dram shop in Holborn after leaving Tottenham-court- road and there Silk gave Allden a sovereign and told him to go into the gin-shop to get change—we did not drink there—he brought back 19s 6d and said he had had something to drink with the other 6d —I then went over Waterloo-bridge to the Coburg theatre and there I sat Allden down and took Silk home—he gave me a crown Cross-examined by MR JONES Q How long was Silk in your sight at any one time that evening A Half an hour not more—it was about dusk when they engaged my cab CHARLES ALLDEN I am now in custody I was in the employ of Messrs Christy hat manufacturers Bermondsey—I recollect being in their workshop some time ago when Silk was there—he said we might fold four hats and take them home to his house—he folded them himself and took them to his house himself—he steamed them which makes them soft so that they will fold in a small compass—it would require to put them over the steam to open them again to make them saleable—he put two into his bosom and two into his hat—I went to his house that evening—he steamed them between seven and eight o clock in the evening—I do not know the name of the street he lives in—we went as far as St Thomas a-hospital gates and took Brown s cab—we had four hats in a handkerchief—we went to the corner of Crown-street St Giles s—I was left in the cab and Silk went to Marks s—he returned two or three times and said Marks was not at home—he at last came and fetched the handkerchief with the hats in it—we continued in the cab—the last time he came out of Marks s he came away without the bundle—we stopped and had something to drink at a public-house at the corner of Crown-street Tottenham-court-road—we continued there not a great while and then went to a public-house in High-street St Giles s and then had something to drink—he went to the door with me but I do not think he got out—I changed a sovereign there I think but I will not say—the public-house was below Monmouth-street—we than drove down Drury-lane over Waterloo-bridge to the Victoria theatre—neither of us went into the theatre—I got out there—I think the theatre was not open at all at that time—the cab went on to Snow s-fields—I heard Silk tell the man to drive that way—he lives down that way Cross-examined by MR JONES Q You have come out of Newgate A Yes it is the first time I have been in prison—I was never in custody before nor ever charged with any offence before—I have been in the employ of Mr Moore in Bond-street the army accoutrement-maker—I worked for him twice—he lent me to Mr Wilson of St Martin s-lane—I was never charged by Mr Moore with robbing him—I was not discharged for robbing him—I never heard of Mr Jackson charging me with taking improper entries in Mr Christy s books nor any thing of the kind—it was about half-past four o clock when we left the shop on the evening in question as near as I can recollect—the shop is in Bermondsey about five minutes walk from St Thomas s-hospital gates—I was taken into custody this night fortnight—two hats were then found on me belonging to the prosecutor THOMAS WILLIAMSON I am foreman to the prosecutors I know these hats to be their property—in an unfinished state my employers would sell them for 13s 6d or 14s —if complete they would be worth about 25s or 26s Cross-examined by MR PHIILIPS Q Did you put a value on them at the office A Yes at about 9s unfinished but I was not examined on Marks s case—those hats were not in the same state as these looking at some —11s would not be a good price for these hats unfinished—I could not buy them at any manufacturers in London at that price COURT Q Were they stiff when lost A Stiffened—steaming would soften them and make them fold up JURY Q Were there marks in this hat at the time A Yes we do not sell them in this rough state—there is always a mark on them MR PHILLIPS Q There is no mark by which a stranger to Mr Christy would know it was his hat A No a manufacturer would buy them in the state they are now to sell again but not wet and folded up—they do not come up wet from the country they come up dry and folded in a very different manner Silk s Defence This day fortnight I left the manufactory some time after Allden—he had been steaming nearly all day over the copper—some time after I went to take a pint of porter in King-street Snow s-fields—I had been home and back again three quarters of an hour—I then found four hats concealed in my hat—Mr Christy came into the shop and I threw those hats out of my hat feeling confused—Mr Christy s men can prove they saw Allden conceal the hats in mine and two hats were found concealed in his own hat—I could have thrown them any where to get rid of them—I was away from the premises for three quarters of an hour Mark s Defence I have known Silk for five or six years as a manufacturer who has been in business for himself and kept workmen and apprentices—I have bought hats of him off and on sir years—I always considered them his own hats—we gave him orders and he brought things corresponding to the orders—I never had the least idea he had dishonestly obtained hats which it seems he has done for the last few months RICHARD BROWN I am a silk hat-manufacturer I know Silk—I have dealt with him many times as a manufacturer of hats—I have lately left off dealing with him my brother-in-law being a manufacturer—I know Marks perfectly well he always bore a very respectable character as a tradesman Q Look at one of those unfinished hats for a manufacturer to buy of another to make up and sell again what should you consider a fair price A I am not exactly acquainted with the quality of stuff hats being a silk manufacturer but I have had such hats frequently offered for sale by manufactures at 8s or 10s —there is a considerable profit I believe on stuff hats MR BODKIN Q Where was Silk s manufactory A In Webber-street New-cut—I have been there many times—I have seen one man making and another finishing besides himself—I have not been there for two years—I have dealt with him from fifteen to thirty or forty times—I have not purchased hats from him wet and crnmpled up—I never had hats in that state offered for sale—the price of beaver hats varies very much—the same quality even varies considerably in price MR JONES Q How long have you known Silk A About twelve years—I have known him as a manufacturer about eight years—I never heard him charged with any thing of this sort before—he bore an honest character as far as I heard GEORGE LLOYD I am a hatter and live in Upper Cleveland-street Fitzroy-square I was in Mark s employ upwards of twelve months three years ago—I knew Silk as a hatter—I always considered him as a master as keeping a shop—I have seen him at Marks s with goods to sell—not very often—he had beaver hats unfinished just as they came from the die— sometimes he brought them in a string sometimes in a handkerchief but not doubled up—I have seen others bring hats doubled up and folded in a handkerchief—Marks lived where he does now when I lived with him—he had two shops in High-street—I defy any man to judge the value of stuff hats within 1s 6d or 2s —this hat is damaged looking at one —in our neighbourhood we are obliged to buy cheap—I would not give more than 10s or 10s 6d for it at the utmost—this other hat is perfect—I would not give more than 10s for it—this other is better and I might go as far as 11s for it in St Giles s but not more—I have known Marks six or seven years—I never heard any thing against him—Davies was his shopman and worked with me he bore an honest character MR BODKIN Q Did Marks carry on the business in the same premises and to the same extent as now when you were with him A I think he has done more business lately but he lived at the same place—he bought beaver hats of Mr Davis and of one Law—sometimes their hats were brought in bags just as the bulk suited them—by steaming hats they will go into a small compass—they are frequently folded in flats to send from London to the country finishers—I never saw hats crumpled up at Marks s—hats in St Giles s very seldom fetch more than one guinea each—many houses profess to sell the best at 17s —some at 26s but the major part of the trade sell them for about a guinea—no man with any brains would buy a hat crumpled up in this way—he could not tell whether it was injured or not MR ADOLPHUS Q Before a hat sells for 21s I suppose a great deal more is done to it A Yes there is the finishing which amounts to 1s 6d and the trimming THOMAS HARRISON I am a hatter and live in Compton-street Soho I have known Silk for years as a hat-manufacturer—I have dealt with him as such repeatedly—I have known Marks fourteen or fifteen years—he always bore a highly honourable character—I have known Davies as his foreman MR JONES Q How recently have you known Silk as a manufacturer A The last transaction I had with him was within two months—it is about five or six years since I knew him in Webber-street—I have two hats here which I bought of him the week preceding Easter MR BODKIN Q It is six years since you had any transactions with him till lately A Yes it is since he has been in custody that I understood he was a journeyman—I believed him still to be a manufacturer—he never brought me any hats in this crumpled state—I should not have bought them in that state—it is common to fold them but this is crumpled in—I should look at a hat in that state with suspicion JOHN LAW I am a hatter in King s-bench-walk Southwark I have sold Marks hats for the last four years—I sometimes sent them folded and sometimes blocked in the hood—I have never sold any exactly in this state—I have seen Silk but never deak with him he was a master hatter when I knew him two years ago—I lately heard of his being a journeyman MR BODKIN Q Do not you know that a folded hat is a very different thing to what you now hold in your hand A Certainly if it is folded warm in the hot steam you may fold it up any how after it gets cold we get it out again by putting it on the steam again—there would be no necessity to crumple four hats up to take two miles except he had somewhere else to go and did not wish the hats to be cumbersome THOMAS DAVIS I am a hat-manufacturer and live in the Mint Southwark I have dealt with Marks—I have sold him what are called unfinished bodies—sometimes they were taken flat and sometimes otherwise—they were 10s 10s 6d and 9s 6d and the coarsest 8s 6d —I have taken them to him in small parcels a few at a time—I knew Silk as a master hatter by the Coburg theatre MR BODKIN Q How long ago is that A Five or six years ago—this hat is what I call an unfinished body—this would be 11s or 12s —this is the form in which I sell a folded hat looking at another —I have not any in this form—this appears a pretty finish quality—steaming it and crumpling it up would not injure it—it is done to pack it close if it is going into the country then we always send them that way but not to send them about town—I have not put hats in that form to send to customers in London MR ADOLPHUS Q When a hat is packed in that smaller form is it a halfpenny the worse for it A No I have packed them so for the country and have known them returned from the country packed in that way WOOLF COLLINS I am a batter and live in Crown-street St Giles s Davies lives in the same house—on Wednesday evening the 22nd of April I was at home—Davies was there between nine and ten o clock at nigh—he had burnt his leg on Easter Sunday and was in bed—I saw him in bed PRISCILLA COLLINS I am the wife of the last witness On the Wednesday in Easter week I was at home all day—I saw Davies in the morning and he went to work but very much unable—he had burnt his foot on Easter Sunday—he was at home on Monday and Tuesday and about five o clock on Wednesday afternoon he came home and went to bed—his wife advised him to go to bed and so did I—I am positive he

the said Frederick Allen MR DOANE conducted the Prosecution ROBERT DADDS I carry on business with my brother William we are wholesale grocers and live in Leadenhall-street On the 14th of May this hogshead of sugar was sent out but I did not see it—I received information and went to Gray s-inn-lane where I found Allen with our cart and horse—I heard that an accident had happened—the hogshead was in the road—I looked into the cart and saw Allen in the act of removing a bag of sugar to the front of it—he was ourcarman—I asked what he had got there—he said the sugar which he had picked up out of the road—I examined the hogshead and on looking to the drawing-hole I perceived the tin was off which caused my suspicion—the hogshead was perfect except that—I gave Allen into custody after he returned to our house—the bag contained 98lbs of sugar worth about 2l 10s WILLIAM JOHN JACKSON I am warehouseman to Messrs Dadds On the 14th of May about half-past six o clock I saw a hogshead of sugar weighed it was fifteen hundredweight three quarters—I gave it to Allen to take to Euston-square—I did not see him again—at a quarter-past eleven o clock the same night I saw the hogshead of sugar and I weighed it again the next morning—I had seen the hogshead put into Allen s cart there was nothing else in the cart there was no bag—when I weighed the hogshead again it weighed fifteen hundredweight all but fourteen pounds there was a deficiency of ninety-eight pounds—I took the bag of sugar out of the cart myself when it came back with the officer—the sugar in the bag weighed ninety-eight pounds—Allen told me he had picked it up in the cart and put it into the bag—I recollect when the hogshead went out the drawing-hole was quite perfect and a square piece of tin was nailed over it—I did not see the tin again it was off the hogshead Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Where did you put the sugar that night A In the warehouse —Mr Dadds had the key I gave it him that night—there is but one key—there were some boxes of fruit in the cart and two more hogsheads of sugar of very different qualities but there was only one hogshead in when the accident happened—I was not there at the time—in the progress of the journey the hogsheads might have knocked one against another—Allen never denied that the sugar had been in the hogshead he said it fell out and he picked it up—he had been two or three months in the prosecutor s employ MR DOANE Q You having seen the drawing-hole in your opinion if the two hogsheads had knocked together would it have forced open that hole A No the sugar did not appear as if it had been in the road there was no dirt on it it was a very wet night THOMAS ELLIS police-constable G 103 I recollect the accident happening to the cart in Gray s-inn-lane I went to the spot and saw Allen in a short time—I asked him who the man was that was hurt—I had before seen Chapman being carried to the doctor s—Allen said it was a poor man whom he had picked up on the road and given him a lift—I saw one hogshead of sugar—I assisted in getting the horse who had run away—after that I said to Allen You had better get into the cart and remove these plums before I let the tail-board down —after he had removed part I saw a sack with something in it he drew it towards the front of the cart—Mr Dadds came up and asked what that was Allen said gome sugar which had fallen out and he had picked it up in the road—I saw the sugar it certainly did not appear as if it had been in the road—I then went with the cart to the prosecutor s—Allen there said it had got out of the hogshead into the cart and he picked it up in the cart—he was then given into my custody—I told the warehouseman to bring me a piece of string and some sealing-wax and the bag was sealed up till the morning—I saw it next morning and saw the hogshead weighed Cross-examined Q Was not the cart in the road A Yes it was tilted up the shafts were up in the air JOSEPH WEBB I live in Pinder s-place Gray s-inn-road On the evening of the 14th of May I was in Gray s-inn-road I saw the cart with the horse hanging up there was a hogshead of sugar and two boxes in it—I went up to give assistance—Allen said there was a man behind that the hogshead was upon him and he was sure he was killed—we cut the tarpaulin to get the hogshead out and Chapman who was under it was taken to the doctor s insensible—I saw the hogshead taken out of the cart and placed in the road—I was there the whole time the cart was in the road—no sugar came out into the road there was no tin over the hole then—when Mr Dadds came up Allen said he had got some sugar in the bag which he had picked up out of the street and then he said he picked it up out of the cart Cross-examined Q Did he say both things in the same place A Yes—I have heard the policeman say that it was after he got to the prosecutor s that he said he picked it up out of the cart—I am sure he said street to me—I do not know whether Mr Dadds was close to me at the time he said it—he was on the spot—I and others were assisting to get the wounded man out I cannot say whether Mr Dadds was near enough to hear it—it was Mr Dadds who put the question to him—I saw the hole in the cask—if any sugar came out it could not be above a pound or a pound and a half—not such a quantity as this produced Allen s Defence Webb is a false-swearing man—I leave the rest to my Counsel John Hughes a cow-keeper and Sarah Cresswell of Christiana-street St George s gave Allen a good character ALLEN— GUILTY Aged 21 — Transported for

the door and I took Davis to the station-house Cross-examined Q You say he gave an account of the four spoons was that in answer to a question put to him by his master A I cannot say as I did not hear

parcels when ordered by Noel the head warehouseman A Yes Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How long had Noel been in the prosecutor s employ A About nine years and Faircloth about eight MR DOANE Q On the same day had you occasion to go to Aldersgate-street A Yes to my dinner about half-past three o clock—I met Mackay the prisoner with a piece of canvas—in consequence of which I communicated something to my master—I afterwards went to the White Bear public-house at the corner of Barbican—I found there a roll of canvas left by a person of the name of Ross—it was the one that I suspected

What is Mackay A I do not know—I have been in the habit of seeing him walking up and down Aldersgate-street in company with Noel—he is no acquaintance of mine—I have not spoken to him above twice before—that was about two months ago—he used to make moss when I lived in the employ of Hutton and Lepine in Newgate-street—I have spoken to him then—I might have said Good morning or something of that sort—it is about eighteen months ago since I lived there—I did not speak to him then above twice but that was before any thing of this occurred—I do not keep these things in my mind—I will not swear I have not seen him half a dozen times when he came to Hutton and Lepine s to sell goods MR PAYNE Q How many persons are there in your employ beside the prisoner yourself and a boy A There are three male hands at the present time—there were two on that day—I was behind the counter when I saw Faircloth pass through with the canvas—there was a lady and gentleman in the shop at the time whom I was serving but no other person belonging to my master was there—I will not swear this is the piece I saw Faircloth with Mackay Q Did you know I served your shop A Yes I knew your name was John Mackay—the name you went by was Ross—I suspected you to have goods that were stolen—I did not stop you because I went to my employers and told them I knew you—I could always find you THOMAS BORTON I

the warehouse—it was not my duty but Faircloth s to carry out parcels—Noel was my superior therefore I complied with his request—on Saturday afternoon I saw Faircloth about five minutes to two o clock with a bag under his arm in Newgate-street on my return from St Paul s Church-yard COURT Q Do you send parcels from your house without their being directed A No This parcel is not directed

to go out—when I went out I left Groom in the shop—when I saw Faircloth in the street he had an empty bag—it was his duty to carry out parcels if directed—I can swear this was not directed MR DOANE Q Is it usual for warehousemen to cut the pieces A Sometimes they did RICHARD GROOM re-examined When I saw Mackay in the shop with the canvas it was rolled up in that manner—I knew it was canvas by its being rolled up and covered with brown paper—it was rolled as all the others are JAMES GILES re-examined The parcel that Noel brought down was like this MR PHILLIPS Q Is it not all rolled up in this way A Yes—it was brought down before my face—I did not go to examine it in the shop for it was not brought into the shop HENRY BARLING I am one of the partners in this firm The prisoner Mackay married Mr M Kenzie s aunt—we have employed him in the buisness formerly—in consequence of some information from Groom on Saturday the 23rd I spoke to Faircloth between four and five o clock just after Groom returned from dinner—Mr M Kenzie was present—I asked Faircloth where he was going with the parcel—he said To the Bell Inn in Warwick-lane with some old wrappers —I asked who he gave them to the clerk or the porter —he said he had thrown them into the warehouse—I went to the inn and inquired of the clerk and there had been no wrappers there—I then came back to Mr M Kenzie and told Faircloth that it was untrue—that he had not been down to the Bell—I said Faircloth you had better tell the truth for I shall be able to find it out —we had Noel up with him—he denied all that Faircloth had said—this piece contains fifty yards of two-quarters linen canvas and is worth 28s —there is nothing in this book relating to the canvas—if it had been sold it should have been ticked off—it has been ticked off and then rubbed with the finger—it has not been sold Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How many pieces of canvas of this width and rolled up in this way have you in your shop A We may have from twenty to thirty—I should be sorry to swear when I saw this piece in our stock—we take stock but once a year—the warehouseman generally takes an account of what goods Come in—I cannot swear that this had not been sold Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Would Faircloth have any means of knowing whether goods had been sold A Only by the invoice—he had no access to the books—he is a man of weak intellect—he has had an injury in the head—he can eat and drink and read HENRY HART I am bar-man at the Mourning Bush Tavern in Aldersgate-street On the 23rd of May this piece of canvass was brought there by Faircloth about two o clock—he asked me to take care of it for Mr Ross who would call for it—the prisoner Mackay whom I had known by that name came for it at nearly three o clock—I told him there was a parcel

for felaniously receiving the same well knowing the same to have been stolen against the Statute &c JOHN HOWE I am a builder and plumber The prisoner Easton was in my employ as a journeyman for two years and worked for me once before—I did not know of this loss—I found some lead at the station-house—one of the picecs I can identify as mine from its peculiar shape and the manner of its being cut—Easton had no right to sell lead—it was new lead—a piece had been cut out of it for a particular purpose—on the evening before his apprehension he was directed to cut out some pieces of lead which were going into the country and I believe this to be the remnant of a sheet which he had cut Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Did you cut the lead out yourself A No I did not—I employ him as a plumber—I manufacture a particular article for hatters—I was not apprentieed to a plumber but I can swear to the lead—one piece had been lying about a king while before—I had jobs in hand at the time on which I employed Eastton—I set him to do some lead-work at Newton s tavern and to put a new pipe to it Q If he discovered more work was necessarry did he do right to take lead to use on that work A Certainly not without consulting as—when I gave him discretion he finished jobs as he thought tit—I once employed him to do work at Mr Irving s a batters—he has been employed there so often I cannot tell whether he found it necessary to use used more lead there than I thought necessary—he might use more than I first told him probably—he was liming an old wooden sink at the Three Tons in the Borough the day before he was apprehended—I have not been there to ascertain whether more lead was necessary there than I told him to take—I am certain more was not necessary—I did not find the job complete—I told him to take a piece of lead and showed him the place it was to be put into—he cut that out on Friday afternoon and took it to his job where he was apprehended but he had not used it—the lead for that job was there—there was lead enough to finish that job on the premises—there was a piece about six feet long and seven inches wide cut out of a sheet of lead at my shop—I heard jim tell the Magistrate that he took this lead to finish that job and left it on the way to go back to some nails JOHN WOODHOUSE police-constable M 13 On Satuday the 26th of September I was on duty in Southwark-bridge-road and saw the prisoner Easton carrying a roll of lead on his shoulder—he passed me coming in a direction from his master s house after passing me some distance he turned into Red-Cross-Street and there I lost sight of him—it was at seven o clock in morining—I did not see him any more till I came to the prisoner Anderson s shop which is a marine-store-shop in Red-cross-street—I there saw Anderson handing the roll of lead out of a scale to a boy who was carrying it into his back permises—it appeared the same roll that Easton had been carrying—the boy carried it into a back shed at Anderson s—I could not tell whether he spoke to the boy for Easton was turning road to come out of the shop—I did not see any lead in Anderson s front shop—I asked Easton Just against the door what he had done with the lead—he said it was all right he had only left it there—he had come out without any nails and was going back to fetch them—I asked who he worked for—he said for Mr Howe of Southwark-bridge-road—Anderson was on the other side of the counter—I said Anderson bring that lead forward —he said I know nothing about it it was only left here —I took themn both to the station-house—I asked Anderson how it came in the seale—he said that Easton put it in by accident when he brought it into the shop—I did not then notice whether there were any weights in the scale—I took them both to the station-house and returned—the lead was weighed at the station-house and weighed thirty pounds—I returned to Anderson s shop and found two weights in the scale—I spoke to the boy and looked at the weights—one was twenty-eight pounds and the other two pounds Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q This was the usual time of going to wrok A It was about seven o clock—there was nothing to conceal the lead—I found he worked where he said Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q I suppose you searched Easton at the station-house A Yes and fonned 5s 11 1/2d On him—I found nothing particular on Anderson—I knew him before—he brought the lead forward when I desired him—the station-house is about 200 yards from where I took them—I returned to the house in about a quarter of an hour—I took Anderson in his own house—I found no nails on Easton COURT Q How far was Eastton from his mastter s shop A Not above thiry yards MR CLARKSON Q Did you say you saw the lead in the scale A Yes I saw Anderson taking it from the scale—Easton must have been in the shop about a minute and a half before I saw him there—I saw no money pass MR DOANE Q You swear you saw him lifting it out of the scale A Yes it was in the scale—Anderson was hoisting it out of the scale—I saw him in the act of handing it out of the scale—he had not got the weight of it in his hand—he had just got hold of it to lift it out just as I was looking into the window—the scale was quite clear of the counter in the centre of the shop—Anderson admitted before the Magistrate that it had been in the scale—the small piece of head was rolled up inside the large piece JURY Q Did the prisoners seem to be acquainted A I did not hear any converstion between them JOHN HOWE re-examined The lead cost me about 4s 6d —the selling price is about 15s or 16s per cwt —I mean to be sold as old lead—this is new lead—it cost me from 19s to 19s 6d per cwt —I do not charge 4d a pound—a small quantity would be charged higher than a large one—if it was cut out of a sheet I must charge more than for the whole sheet as it would be spoiled in cutting out—the thirty pounds did not cost me as much as 5s 11 1/2d —I should charge 24s or 25s per cwt Easton s Defence On the 25th of September I was employed by Mr Howe to do a job at the Three Tuns—he told me to put some lead round the back as flushing and new pipe—I measured the piece for the back which was seven feet four inches which I cut off a whole sheet—I took some pipe to the job—on Friday afternoon in cutting the old pipe I saw the bottom of the sink would not stand and I thought I would take this piece of seven pound lead as it laid there thinking to cut a piece out to put in the bottom of the sink—the other piece I took to cover some wood-work which I thought would complete the job although Mr Howe did not tell me to do so JOHN WOODHOUSE re-examined He was not going in a direction to the Three Tuns—he had passed the place he ought to have turned down to go there—he was not above four or five uards out of the direct road William Baker cabinet-maker Redcross-street Borough gave Easton a good character EASTON— GUILTY Aged 28

Company since December last—h was employed from the 29th of October last till he was taken on the 23rd of November—various parcels of skins arrived by the Prince Rupert amongst which were two parcels of beaver skins—I was present when they arrived and I checked them as they were counted by the Custom House Officer—they are made up in bales from three to seven hundred in each—they are packed in large deer skins and tied with slips of damp deer skins which dry shrink and cause the skins to be tied very tightly—It was impossible they could be opened on the voyage without its being seen—the number of beaver skins we received at that time were in one parcel 11 637 and in the other 12 566—they were deposited in the top floor of our warehouse—I remember Mr Lee coming to our warehouse but I did not see him—shortly before he came I saw the make prisoner in the top floor of the warehouse at the time the men were gone to lunch—It was not the floor on which he was employed and he had no

prospect-place Kennington-road —I delivered the last skin to the officer—the other eight I had sent to Mr Lee CHARLES DAVEY I am a shopman to the last witness On the 21st of November in consequence of

found that was their home—the female prisoner was not at home—the man was—Furley the officer called me up into the room and the male prisoner put his coat on I said he was the man—he was then taken to Union-hall and the woman was taken afterwards—these are the eight skins I took from Mr Doehnel to Mr Lee for sale Mary Ann Jepson The reason my husband was present was I had to redeem a trifling

no beaver of that description brought to this country but by the Hudson s Bay Company I detained the skins and sent my brother to the Hudson s Bay Company—the skins were not out of my sight till me were at Union-hull—on my sending to the Hudson s Bay Company Mr Hagell came and claimed the skins immediately—they are new and worth from 25s to 30s each Mary Ann Jepson Mr Lee said there were more skins of this sort in circulation and he told the officer if he would give himself a little trouble he would find more about Witness I have seen more skins in circulation which no doubt were taken in the same way but they were not this year s skins—It was in the February or March this year—I did not allude to this year s new skins but last year s skins—I was asked if I had seen any before and I said I had but I did not allude to this year s skins WILLIAM HAGELL I have been warehouse-keeper to the Hudson s Bay Company about thirty years I know that two parcles of skins arrived for them by the Prince Rupert last October—they were in the warehouse—once of them had been taken Out or sold or disposed of by the Company in any way—I know of no person who imports these skins but the Hudson s Bay Company—these skins were not in a state fit for sale—they had to undergo a preparation and every skin passes through my hands—I went to Mr Lee s consequence of their calling at the Hudson s Bay House—Mr Lee produced these eight skins to me—I have no doubt they are the property of the Hudson s Bay Company—they are part of the Prince Rupert GEORGE FURLONG I am an officer I went to No 8 Amelia-place on the 23rd of November—It is a good way from Kenning ton—I went up stairs and inquired for a person named Price—no such person lived there—I desired to see the lodgers—I saw the male prisoner in the Back room up stairs—I called up Davey and as soon as he saw him he said he was the person who was with the woman who sold the skins— I had asked the prisoner s landlord and he said he lodged there —he said I was quite welcome to search his place and he lighted me—I waited about an hour or an hour and a half and the female prisoner came home—I asked her if her name was Price—she said No Jepson but that she had lived with a man named Price—she said the skins were given her by a particular friend of her s named Price—I asked where he lived and she could not give me the slightest information—I went to prospect-place and to several other places but could find no Price—these are the skins I received from Mr Lee Mary Ann Jepson I did not say I lived with Price I said particular friend of mine named Price WILLIAM HAGELL JUN I have brought one skin out of the pared of eleven thousand and odd—these appear to be the same—from my knowledge of the business and the skins passing through my hands I have no doubt that they are the same—there are nine missing and nine found—there is a factory called the York Factory at Hudson s Bay—these skins came from there—It is their factory—they manufacture for none but the Hudson s Bay Company—the savages bring their skins there at different times and they pick them and send them over John Jepson I have no defence nor have I

PAUL for feloniously receiving the same well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c ant that he had before been convicted of felony to which DYSON pleaded GUILTY MESSRS PHILLIPS CLARKSON and PAYNE conducted the prosecution WILLIAM BRITTAIN I am a booksellers and live in Queen s Head passage Paternoster-row I am in the habit of purchasing books of the Religious Tract Society—I have purchased the Weekly Visitor for the last three years—it is published to the trade on Monday morning and to the publie on Tuesday—it always bears the date of Tuesday and is a weekly publication—for three months previous to the 19th of December I had found that the trade were being supplied with it on the Staurday afternoon and on Saturday the 19th of December about seven o clock in the evening I went to the shop of the prisoner Paul in Paternoster-row—I think it is No 52—it is within two doors of the Religious Tract Society Depository—I asked there for two dozen copies of the Weekly Visitor and paid 9d for them—Mr Paul served me with them—I received twenty-seven for the two dozen—I was in the habit of receiving twenty-six from the Society before this—is consequence of suspicion I had seen Mr Theobald on Monday the 14th of December—on making this purchase at Paul s shop I had been passing the window and saw a person being supplied with the Weekly Visitor and when I got in I saw him supplied with very nearly four hundred copies—the pile from which they were supplied was under the counter—the four hundred were on the counter and the fresh hundred was broken to supply me and put under the counter again—they were all tied up in bundles in hundreds—I before observed them supplied to people as quick as possible and put out of the way when strangers were in the shop—they were always kept with the face down—I had observed that for some weeks before when I had been there for other publications—I have seen the same persons supplied with them frequently—I know several persons who deals in the same pamphlet as well as myself—when I went on the 19th of December I told Paul I always made it a point to leave the City on Saturday evening and did not come till late on Monday and wished them in my shop ready for my boy to supply them on Monday morning—that was my reason for going for them—I paid Paul himself for them Q When on other occasions you have seen them sold was it before or on the day of publication A Before—on the Saturday afternoon and it was in consequence of my losing the sale of them through their being supplied before that I went to Mr Theobald s at the Depository to ask if I could have the same favour allowed me—when I bought the twenty-seven I took them to the Tract Society to show them I could get them and produced them to Mr Theobald—the prisoner never gave me any reason why he could supply them on Saturday Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q I suppose it is a desirable thing for any body in the trade to get them on Saturday A Yes I was very glad to get them on that day for my own convenience—it was very widely known in the trade that the prisoner was selling them on the Saturday—I do not think he would sell them to strangers—it was well known to the trade—I gave 9d for the two dozen—that is the usual price to the trade 4 1/2d a dozen—I do not sell them retail—if I sold them by the dozen I should get nothing but if I sold them in odd numbers I should get the thirteenth book—I should gain three farthings out of the two dozen COURT Q But in this case you would have got one number out of the two dozen if you sold them wholesale A Yes MR DOANE Q Do you sell any weekly publications yourself A Every description—it is very seldom the case that twenty-seven are allowed to two dozen—I have done it occasionally to oblige a person best it is at a very trifling profit—I have sold Chamber s Journal at twenty-seven to two dozen because we are allowed a discount of five per cent on that and that is not allowed on this work un less we take a certain quantity—if 5l worth of the Weekly visitor is taken five percent would be allowed I have sold Paul twenty-seven of Chamber s Journal to the two doses and the penny and Saturday Magazines—there was only one other person in the sheep—I knew that person and he knew me—I observed nothing extractsnary in the mode of doing biasness MR CLARKSON Q I thought you had observed always a disposition to get rid of the Weekly Visitor as soon as possible when it was sold A Yes—I observed nothing unusual in this transaction to what there generally had been—he always got them out of sight as quickly as possible—the boy had a bag on the counter and put them into the bag as quick as possible—I did not ask this of Paul as a favour—I never purchased twenty-seven Weekly Visitors to two dozen of any body except Paul—I have bought them of the Tract Society and got twenty-six—there is a discount of five per cent if we lay out 5l —there is a discount of 10l as the Weekly Visitor COURT Q How much must you take to get ten per cent A 5l worth of the Weekly Visitor—I have known Paul in the trade about twelve months—he lived within a few doors of the Tract Society all that time JAMES PATTEN I am a bookseller and live in High-street St Gilles s I have been in the habit of selling the Weekly Visitor—I obtained the copies I sold in the first instance from the office where they were published—I have obtained them from Paul for nearly twelve months—his shop is within a door or two of the Religious Tract Society—he allowed me twenty-seven to the two dozen—he observed that I could have there on the Saturday afternoon—the publication day at the office is Monday morning to the trade and Tuesday to the public as I was not very particular to time I did not always get them from Paul till Monday best mostly I got them on Saturday night—about three weeks ago I seat for them and did not get them on Saturday—I went to Paul and asked his the reason I did not have the number I should have on Saturday—he stated there had been some piece of work about publishing the visitor before the time—it was owing to one Brittain going to the Society and showing them that he could have been them on Saturday night but he considered it would be all blown over in a few weeks time Cross-examined Q Do you sell the Penny Magazine A Yes a great many—I have sold twenty-seven of them to the two dozen JOHN DAVIS I am superintendent of the Religious tract Society I have the charge of the Society s stock—John Dyson was a servant of mine—he was in the warehouse department—the country department—he had no authority to make any sales or make out any bills of parcels whatever—I cannot say that I know his handwritting—I have seen him write frequently—I should say that these bills of parcels are in his handwritting—it was reported in the house that some publications were lost and on inquiry it was found to be so—money paid on account of the Society would reach my hand every night from the parties in the shop who bring their cash books to me—I have not received money for any of the articles mentioned in these bills of parcels to my knowledge Cross-examined Q Them you may have received some of these A No sir if I had I must have known—8l has been received but beyond that I have no knowledge—Dyson has been about six years with us—I am the Society s agent and am responsible for all that goes out—the bosses are rented in my name and the bills of parcels are made in my name—I pay the rent for the Society—I superitend their concerns and hare done so for nearly twenty years—there is no other person in the shop who control over the goods except as shopmen under me—I am responsible to the Society—I have looked at the papers that were handed to me they are quite irregular—this is one of the printed wills of parcels but it has no name or date—my own name is on it but there is not the same of the purchaser nor the date—this is one of the printed forms sent out form our office—it has my name engraved at the head of it so that my one would know this belonged to the Religious Tract Society and that I was the agent here are several bills above 5l and some not on printed paper but plain MR CLARKSON Q Suppose Dyson had been disposed to deal improperly had he access to these bills of parcels A They are accessible to my servants in the house—it is invariably the custom to set down the name of the purchaser and the date if it exceeds 5l —I never sent out bills not printed and without the vendor s name MR DOANE Q Are you aware that Paul could know that internal regulation A I don t know that he could MR CLARKSON Q How long had he lived next door to you A About a year and a half but he had ample means before that from having made many purchases above 5l and received the discount—Do you must have known Paul COURT Q Is there a department for the sale of your Publications besides the warehouse department A Yes Dyson was in the country warehouse for executing country orders MR CLARKSON Q Do you he lived these bills to be in the handwriting of the prisoner Dyson A I believe they are COURT Q You say the clerk brought you their cash books in the evening A yes and accounted to me—it was their duty to put down every item separately—Dyson s duty was to look out and execute country orders and pack them and he himself was not to sell me any body—if he had been at the retail counter he would have been out of his place—he would be able to get at any part of the stock Q Do you yourself know how long Paul had dealt with the Society at any previous time when he was agent to another institution A he may be five or six years since but since Dyson has been there he seldom came we hardly knew him as a customer but I apprehend he would know all the servants of the house—he lived nearly opposite before THOMAS DIX I am superintendent of the binding department of the Religious Tract Society On Monday the 21st of December I went to Paul and told him I was given to understand that he had been selling the Weekly Visitor which was published by us on Monday on the previous Saturday and I was very anxious on the subject having the charge of that part of the stock myself—he said he had purchased 200 of the society on Saturday last and that one of the hundred contained a mixture of the number published on the 21st of December—I asked him how many he supposed there might be of that Monday s publishing he said be should suppose about fifty I said Do you suppose they exceeded that number —he said I should think not —I then asked him if such as occurrence ever took place before he said No —Dyson came into the shop while I was there and inquired if his book was ready Paul said No —Dyson had paper open in his hand which appeared to be as order—I saw Paul again the same day in the after part when I was in company with Mr Lloyd—we both conversed with him—I told him we could not make out respecting the sale of the weekly Visitor or how he could posses himself of so many—I said I could not make out how he could sell twelve dozen to one person sixteen to another and two to another out of fifty numbers—he said it was very strange he thought it was impossible—I told him I could bring evidence to prove that he had done so—he said it was very singular—Mr Lloyd asked him whether he knew Dyson he said Yes —he then asked if he had had any business transactions with him he said No —I remember Dyson being given into custody—on Monday the 21st Mr Lloyd asked the prisoner what Dyson came for he said he came for a novel and know where Dyson lived—I was present when his house was searched—this paper was found there—I missed 2 200 Weekly Visitors—that was 1 100 of No 179 published on the 21st of December and 1 100 of the following week—they are worth 3s per 100 COURT Q You mean the number for the 28th of December A yes MR PAYNE Q Were you present at any search of Paul s premises A Yes I took this list of publications published by our house which were found there—it contains a great number of the Society s publications ROBERT THEOBALD I am assistant to Mr Davis On saturday the 19th of December Mr Brittain brought me twenty-seven weekly Visitors which he stated he had brought of Paul—these are the publications—they all bear the date of the 22nd of December—they would be in course of publication by the society to the trade on Monday morning—on Monday the 21st a message was sent to Paul s shop and he came in the evening between six and eight—Mr Jones Mr Lloyd Mr Dix and myself were there—I heard all the questions that were put—Mr Paul was asked to account for selling the Weekly Visitors on the saturday—he replied that he had sent a lad to purchase two hundred of the preceding week and that one of the bundles contained fifty of that week and fifty of that succeeding week—he was asked whom he sent to buy them—he replied A lad who came into my shop —being asked what lad he said he did not know but would inquire—he was going away after about half an hour s interview and promising to produce the lad if he could and throw light on the investigation that he knew was then going on—he was asked where he bought these numbers but not by me—I was asked if I had any observation to make—I said we ought not to request of Mr Paul to make the inquiry but to require it of him for no Jury would believe the fact that he was in the habit of sending boys whom he did not know to purchase his goods —I said We do not want more information than Mr Paul can at this moment give us no object can therefore be attained by delay and addressing Mr Paul I said Two things sir are certain the one is that we have been robbed the other is that you have received the goods —I should say that during the conversation Mr Paul had been reminded that sales of fourteen dosen twelve dozen and other sales could be provided against him and I asked him how he could account for such large sales since he had admitted that he only had fifty by mistake that week and that such an error had not occurred before —he said it was impossible—he was asked in the course of the conversation if he had had any business transactions with Dyson and he said he had not—this was Monday the 21st—he went away—I heard nothing more of him till Tuesday the 29th when at about half-past nine o clock in the morning he came into the shop and beckoned me aside—I took him into Mr Davis s counting-room and he said It is of no use attempting to keep this matter a secret any longer I am come to clear myself and to show that I have paid for all the goods that I have had —he then produced these papers which are marked No 1 to 10 in the first parcel and 11 to 26 and this one which makes twenty-seven—I have seen Dyson write frequently—these are Dyson s handwriting—I asked Paul if he had received all the goods specified in these papers—he replied that he had and had paid for them—I asked him How and he pointed to these two papers marked C —he said he had paid for them in his own shop—On inquiring if he had paid the writer of the invoices he said he had on the dates they bear—I asked him if he did not suspect something was wrong—he replied Not till yesterday week —that is the substance of what he said Q Are you able to tell us whether supposing he had purchased the different articles specified in these bills of parcels and paid for them over the counter of the Society s office he would not have received a discount of ten per cent A On such as amounted to above 5l he would—I searched Dyson s clothes which were at the warehouse and found this paper marked A in his waistcoat pocket—there is a memorandum on it at the bottom in Dyson s hand-writing—on these invoices Nos 1to 27 being produced by Paul and these two papers I was proceeding to put them under my coat and Paul said You will not take them —I said Yes I must show them to Mr Jones —and I gave Paul a memorandum that he had delivered papers purporting to be invoices into my hands—Mr Dix was present part of the time during this interview—at the close of the interview before Paul left he asked if John Dyson was in sight—I looked through the counting-house window to ascertain—I then turned to him and said The coast is clear —and Mr Dix in my presence at the same time informed that Dyson was behind the nest of shelves in the library—Dyson had no authority for selling any of the society s publications and he only made out invoices under another young man who was in the country department—the prices on this paper A and the casting up are in Dyson s hand-writing—these invoices are quite irregular and such as could not come from the Society—they have neither the name of the purchaser the date nor receipt and some of them are not printed only written some of them have neither the name of the vendor nor purchaser Cross-examined Q Between the first and second interview about one week had elapsed A Yes he came voluntarily the second time—he had a week to abscond after the first interview—there are deductions from some of these bills—in one case a deduction of 12s on a bill for only six pennyworth of goods—there are prices marked opposite the articles and they are full prices with a very few exceptions—on the 29th he objected to my taking these papers till I gave him a memorandum JAMES PALMER I am one of the clerks of the Bank of England I know the hand-writing of the prisoner Paul—these papers marked A and B are in his hand-writing—I am secretary of the Books Society in Paternoster-row—it was established in 1750 for the circulation of religious books—Paul was in the service of that society for nine years—they are in the habit of almost daily communication with the Religious Tract Society—Paul was their agent—his business was in the house and he resided in the house—he left in September 1832 and set up for himself within a door or two of the Tract Society—the Book Society is opposite COURT Q You say Paul resided in the Book Society s house A Yes—I know that he has gone over to the Tract Society but his business there as agent would be to order the books—he certainly had the means of knowing from the station he filled in the Book Society the transactions of business in the Religious Tract Society The documents No 1 to 27 were all invoices of weekly visitors and other publications of the Religious Tract Society amounting to about 233l but not relating to the present charge The paper marked A and B were inventories of various other publications of the Society DYSON was recommended to mercy by the Society with whom he had resided Six Years on account of his previous good conduct — Transported for Fourteen Years PAUL— NOT GUILTY Before Mr Baron Gurney

Dewer We are founders and smiths and live in Old-street—we make tools—the prisoner was our apprentice for nearly five years—in the course of the last two years I have missed a great many tools—in consequence of information which I received on Thursday the 11th of February I went to the station-house and got two constables—Warton another of my apprentices accompanied me—Pierce at that time was a workman of mine and lived at No 8 Wilson-street Old-street-road—I went to that house with Warton and the two policemen and in the lower room of that house I found a quantity of tools on the floor and some in a box—I knew some of them to be ours—I selected such as I knew and gave Pierce into custody—after that I took a constable back with me to my own manufactory and took the prisoner into custody—I told him I believed he had got some of my tools—he said he had not—he afterwards said he had got some of them—I said I had found some of our tools at Pierce s house and Pierce had said they belonged to Sully—the prisoner said he had not got any of our tools—that he had not taken any of out tools—I said Pierce said he had taken them and that they were at Pierce s house—he said he had made some tools and taken them home with him but he had made them in his own time—most of the tools I found at Pierce s had marks but a chisel had my name on it—it was not present when I was speaking to him—there were screws among the tools and I know them by the paper they were wrapped in the hand-writing of out clerk who has left us was on the paper—the prisoner had no authority to carry away any tools or articles from the premises nor any authority to make tools on the premises Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How long has Pierce been in your employment A I think about three or four months—he was in our employ at that time and had the same opportunities of taking things as the prisoner—I believe some of the articles were produced to Sully—I cannot tell—I do not think the chisel was—we had not found all the tools at that time—a great portion of the things were left at Pierce s—I am not quite certain whether any tools were produced to the prisoner—these things were missed at various times in fact they were hardly kissed till we found them we have such a number of tools—I missed a small tap called a bob before I found them—we missed them from time to time—there are two bolts which I had seen about a fortnight or three weeks before—I may not have seen some of the things for months before MATTHEW PLAK police-constable G 98 I accompanied Mr Dewer to Pierce s house and assisted in removing property found there to the stations-house JOHN PIERCE I live at No 8 Wilson-street Old-street I was in Mr Dewer s employ for about three months—the prisoner and I worked together at the shop—about a fortnight previous to the discovery of these tools he told me he had got a great quantity of tools at Exeter—I asked him particularly if they belonged to him—he said he had bought the best part of them and some his father had made—and he asked if I would allow him to bring them to my house—I said if they all belonged to him I should have no objection—he said he would write a letter on the following Saturday night and take it to his cousin the afterwards said he took the letter down himself to his cousin at the water-side he came back to my house on the same Saturday night—I asked him if he took the letter—he said he did that he had been onboard a long while and had some wine and grog on board—he said the vessel was going to start the following day and the tools were to come up the following week from Exeter—and on the following Monday week he told me the tools had been sent in a cart to Helmet-row—he asked if I would allow him to bring them to my house on the following Tuesday—he said he had been to a friend of his in Helmet-row and all the tools had arrived—my house was afterwards searched—the tools had come to my house on the Tuesday night after the conversation on the Monday—I met the prisoner by appointment that night at the corner of Helmet-row—I engaged a truck and took Warton with me—the prisoner took me to a court in Helmet-row—to Harding s—and I assisted him out of the cellar with a box of tools into the truck—there was one good-sized box and to the best of my knowledge two or three small ones—I took them to my house and the prisoner unlocked them and put the tools on the ground—I had requested Warton to come with me to watch the truck from Helmet-row to my house and to come in half an hour afterwards—I took Warton there that if the tools belonged to Mr Dewer he might give information—I took him as a witness—I had spoken to him on the Monday previous—I had a suspicion that they belonged to Mr Dewer—when Warton came in Sully saw him and exclaimed I am done —Warton said he had instructions from Mr Dewer to come and inspect the tools and if any resistance took place he would call a constable—it was a previous arrangement between Warton and me that he should say so—the prisoner begged of us not to tell—I requested Warton to come with me and acquaint Mr Dewer his tools were in my house—Warton said he did not like that—I then proposed that the property should go back—and the prisoner said he would take all Mr Dewer s property back—the property was selected the following evening—the prisoner filled all his pockets with the tools which he said belonged to Mr Dewer and said he should take them all back to the shop the next morning—I took a great number of drills and turning tools from my house to Mr Dewer s and put them into my cupboard—I was taken into custody the same day—I put them into my cupboard at Mr Dewer s factory—the apprentice came to me that morning and asked if I had brought any tools back and I believe on the following Friday a policeman took them—I put a mark on them—Mr Dewer produced a chuck in the shop at the same time and the drills fitted it—Mr Dewer came to my house on Thursday the 16th of February I believe—I did not know the tools when I saw them seattered on my floor Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How long have you been in Mr Dewer service yourself A About three months—I was in Mr Jackley s a machine-maker for about four years before that—I left him in consequence of the slackness of the trade that was the only reason—I did not tell Mr Dewer of this because I did not like to implicate the prisoner—out of compassion—I desired Warton to go and do it—I did not like to do it myself that was my only reason—the tools were brought to my premises on Tuesday night it was arranged by the prisoner and Warton that all the tools were to go back by Thursday and I was to help them—I did not know for a certainty that they were stolen at the time I put them into my cupboard—I had a strong suspicion Q Did you give one word of information to reach Mr Dewer till you yourself were taken up as the thief the things being found in the cupboard and part at your house A No I did not—there are two bolts I can almost swear to but Mr Dewer makes so many of this sort that I cannot say I can swear to them—I told Sully that I had requested Warton to inform of it—when the tools were brought to my house I said he had a great number of tools—he said yes and I think he said he would not take 100l for all he had got—I asked him if all the tools belonged to him and he said they did belong to him—I said nothing to him that night about acquainting Mr Dewer of it—when they were all out on the floor I said I had a strong suspicion they belonged to Mr Dewer and he said he would take all the property back that night—I am sure of that and also on Wednesday night—Warton was present—I believe he said that after I had told Warton to inform Mr Dewer—the prisoner did not hear me tell Warton to inform Mr Dewer—I whispered it to him on the Tuesday night—I spoke very low—I requested Warton to come with me and acquaint Mr Dewer of it as he had more influence with Mr Dewer than I had and I thought it better for him to come with me—he said he did not like—if he had consented I think I should have gone MR CLARKSON Q Before you went to help him with the tools from the trunk had you spoken to Warton and asked him to come there to watch A I had on the previous Monday GEORGE WARTON I am an apprentice to Messrs Dewer I received information from Pierce on Monday the 8th of February and went to his house on the following Tuesday about half-past eight o clock in the evening—I saw some tools on the floor—I had made an arrangement with Pierce what I was to do in consequence of which when I came into the room I told the prisoner I was authorized by Mr Dewer to come and examine the tools—I was not—the prisoner saud I am done —before that I had been with Pierce to hire a truck and saw it taken to the corner of Helmet-row—I had been watching for the purpose and saw the prisoner join Pierce—they went up a court in Helmet-row—I observed them come out with the truck and go to Pierce s house and after that I went there about half-past eight o clock according to arrangement—when the prisoner said I am done —he asked me what I had come there for—I took up some of the tools and said they belonged to Mr Dewer—the prisoner said they did not he had bought them—I said I knew they were Mr Dewer s—he afterwards confessed that they were so—I saw a chisel with the name on it and pointed it out and he said he took it from the shop—Pierce said they should not be in his house—Pierce asked me to come with him to acquaint Mr Dewer—I refused because I thought if the tools were taken back by little and little Mr Dewer would know nothing about it and he would have his property back again—I persuaded the prisoner to take them back—I first mentioned this to Mr Dewer on the Thursday—I afterwards saw some tools at the factory—I did not see who brought them back COURT Q How do you know they were the same A I saw Pierce sort some out on the Wednesday evening and he brought them out on Thursday MR CLARKSON Q Did you see them at the factory afterwards A Yes—some drills—Pierce carried them to the factory—I afterwards saw Mr Dewer apply the drills to some chisels which he had and they fitted—I accompanied Mr Dewer and the policeman to Pierce s house—they took what Mr Dewer identified and left the rest in charge of the policeman—I know the chisel to be Mr Dewer s Cross-examined Q Was it not Pierce himself that went to procure the truck to take the things to Old-street A Yes—Pierce s room is about eight feet square—Pierce and the prisoner and I were on very good terms—we spoke openly together about the tools—the prisoner said he would take them back the next day Q I believe Pierce told you to go and tell Mr Dewer if he did not A Yes he said he would take them back sooner than that should happen—the prisoner did not hear what Pierce said to me about telling Mr Dewer that was done by ourselves—Pierce did not offer to go with me that night to inform Mr Dewer in the prisoner s presence—he whispered that into my ear—he said Will you come with me to Mr Dewer tonight and acquaint him of it —I said No —I did not want to see him punished—the prisoner slept on Mr Dewer s premises—I told the man who worked with me of it—I did not tell Mr Dewer—the man s name is Mason—he is not here—I had known Pierce about two months—he worked there about three months to the best of my knowledge—I had been to his house two or three times—I got the truck from Old-street—I do not know the number—it was a broker s GEORGE HANDING I live at No 16 Helmet-row St Luke s I have known the prisoner about five years—in the course of last summer he told me he had some tools deposited at Dawson s in Old-street part belonging to him and some belonging to his father and in consequence of a misunderstanding he wished to remove them and put them into my cellar which I granted—and he brought in my presence one box and two tin boxes but I do not know the contents—they remained at my house till the 9th of February when the prisoner came between seven and eight o clock and said he came to fetch the tools away to a shopmate s house in Hackney-road—I did not see them removed being busy at the time—I afterwards found they were gone—they had never been removed from my premises before from the time they were brought there Cross-examined Q How long before they were taken away had you seen them A Not within a fortnight I should think—I cannot tell whether they had been opened in that time—the prisoner brought them to my house either in June or July THOMAS HARDING I am the father of last witness and board with him and lodge in his house I remember the prisoner bringing the tools to my son s—I suppose the prisoner was there five or six times between the tools coming and being taken away—I have given him a light and seen him go down and put the things away when he has brought them—he went into the cellar where the boxes were Cross-examined Q You did not go with him A No I cannot tell what he did—he appeared going to look at the boxes—he had nothing with him that I saw COURT Q Did you never see him with any article when he came or went from your house A Yes he had things in his pocket and went into the cellar and put them out—I did not observe what it was he had—I have never sworn that I did—I gave him a light to take the things down which he brought in his pocket—they were a kind of screws or something—I cannot say what—he brought some in his hat—I cannot say what tools they were ROBERT DEWER re-examined I told the prisoner that I had found some tools at Pierce s and that Pierce said they belonged to him—he said he had not taken any at first but afterwards said he had taken some and that he had made some and taken them too—I found a great quantity of tools at Pierce s—I can speak positively to this tap or hob—my father had it many years before me—I cannot tell when I last saw it on the premises—here are a parcel of screws which bear the date July 19 1834 and the name of Knight written on the paper by one of the clerks—I cannot say when I last saw them—here are two brass bushes which I have every reason to believe are mine by the dimensions of them—I cannot say we have lost them because we keep a stock by us—here is a pair of spring dividers which I am certain are mine—I cannot say when I had seen them last—here is a chisel with my name partly obliterated—it is one of the prisoner would be likely to use—here is a screw tool—I cannot say when I saw this last—it is my property—I never sold it—I know then two bolts to be my property—I lost them about a fortnight before—I found them at Pierce s Cross-examined Q When was it that Pierce said some of the tools belonged to the prisoner A When I saw Pierce at his house on Thursday he said they did not belong to him they belonged to the prisoner—that was at the moment I discovered them COURT Q When was it you found the drills in the possession of Pierce in the cupboard A My brother found them the next day after I had taken them—Pierce had given me no information at all—they were tools Pierce and his mate used MR PHILLIPS Q Did you hear Pierce give his evidence as to how the things got there A Yes he said he took them back and put them in the manufactory—he did not tell me he took them back—he has said so here—I understood that he took them back to the cupboard MR CLARKSON Q Did you make my comparison of the drills with a chuck A Yes and they fitted—I got the chuck from my own manufactory—this is one of the drills I understand Pierce had brought back—I got it at the police-office—I believe the policeman took it from Pierce—I did not see it taken from him HENRY M GFFS I am in Mr Dewer s employ I made the screws and bolts produced—I missed them about a fortnight before they were lost Cross-examined Q You have made a great many A I made sixty and there were two missing—they are nut and screw—this is a screw-bolt GEORGE DAY I am foreman to Messrs Dewer Here are a pair of compasses which I know—they are the property of Mr Dewer—I used them myself—they bear my initials—there are several chisels which I knew by the make of them and having used them—they are my employee s MATHEW PEAK I am an officer I accompanied Mr Dewer to Pierce s house and removed the property to the station-house—I have produced it now—I told the prisoner I was going to take him for stealing a quantity of tools belonging to Mr Dewer—he said he had not taken them—Mr Dewer said he found a great many at Pierce s house—he then said he had brought some—Mr Dewer said did you buy any screw tools or taps —he said No I have made some in my own time—my dinner time—my leisure time—out of your stuff Sir —he said he had taken some—Mr Dewer mentioned screw tools and he said I have taken some EVAN DAVIS I am an officer I accompanied the policeman to Mr Dewer s—I was not present when Peak told him what he was charged with ROBERT DEWER re-examined This is a screw-bolt and nut—I found a great many screw tools at Pierce s—I should think from fifteen to twenty MR PHILLIPS Q When did you miss these brass things A I cannot say—I remember seeing these two bolts on the premises within a fortnight—sixty were ordered and when I wanted to send them home there were only fifty-eight—the two were found in the box at Pierce s house—Warton was with me there—I did not know where Pierce lived till Warton showed me Prisoner s Defence I did not know they were stolen MR DEWER The prisoner said he took the tools—he afterwards said he intended to fit up a

t18360509-1310  1310 RICHARD MORAN was indicted for stealing on the 2nd of April 112lbs weight of currants value 3l 5s and 1 bag value 6d the goods of John Healey Booth and others his masters and CHARLES HARROD for feloniously receiving the same well knowing them to be stolen against the statute &c MESSES BODKIN and BALLANTINE conducted the prosecution JOHN WARNER I was carman to Messrs Booth Ingkedew and Co wholesale grocers for five years The prisoner Moran was in their service eight or nine months I think as porter—after being in their service some time he made some proposals to me—on Saturday the 2nd of April I had been out with my cart all day delivering goods for my masters I returned to the stable and loaded the last I dad out between seven and eight o clock at night—I then saw Moran—he gave me a a bag of currants which he took out of the cellar—he said nothing—I put them in the cart—I knew what to do with them because he had told me before when he first came—the first time I had any conversation with him about it was three weeks or a month after he came there—he had told me that when he gave me any thing I was to take it to Harrod—I took things there very often—I took the bag I received on the 2nd of April to Harrod it was between eight and nine o clock in the evening I think—I had a load to go out with and went and delivered my goods in the cart and then went to Harrod s with the bag of currants—Harrod was there at the time—I took them out I put them down in the shop and said I believe that is all I have for you —he said Very well or something of that kind—I turned out of the shop and went home—I did not take any bill or memorandum—I did not receive any money from Harrod—nothing was said about the price—I saw Moran again next morning Sunday about ten o clock—he came to my house and he said he had been and got the money—I do not think he said how much—he gave me some money—I do not know how much as there was something between us but I think it was a sovereign or half a sovereign—I cannot tell—he had told me that Harrod would give 45s for a cwt of currants—I cannot tell when he told me so—it was when we were in conversation together—we were to have even proportions—there was some money between us—I think he owed me some Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Of course you are telling the truth now A Yes—I cannot say how much money I got—it might have been gold or silver—I was in custody a fortnight or three weeks after I think—it was a month last Saturday—I cannot say whether I was taken the next day or whether I was in custody within three days of the occurrence—I had a letter sent to my master—I have not been spoken to about the evidence I was to give—it is of my own free will—I sweat that and for the sake of justice—I get nothing by it—I expect to save myself that is all and I hope I shall—I know nothing about the officer speaking to my wife to get me to give evidence to convict Harrod—I never heard it from her—I have not spoken to the officers Fogg and Luton about my evidence COURT Q How did you know the bag contained currants A I was very well aware of it—I have handled many of them—it came from a place where currants are kept—I did not see it open—we do not deal in coffee JOHN PRESTON I am one of the mangers of the firm of John Healey Booth and two others wholesale grocers in Upper Thames-street—our stables are in Princes-street close by Harrod s premises—our people going to put up the horses at night have to go near his shop—Moran was in the employ of the firm in April as porter and had been so seven or eight months—we have a cellar where goods are kept—in April we had a stock of currants in bags weighing 1cwt each—they were kept close to the loop hole door in the cellar close to where the cart loads—Moran had to it business in the cellar when the last load was taken out—he had access to it as porter—it was part of his duty to assist in loading the cart—we had a man named George in our employ who was taken ill and left shortly after Moran came—he was a porter also—I heard nothing of this till I received a communication from the officers of the Thomas police—Warner and Moran were then both taken into custody and sent to Giltspur-street prison on the 16th and at six o clock on Monday morning the 18th I received this letter from Giltspur-street in consequence of which I went there and saw Moran—I showed him the letter and stated its contents—he said he did not write it nor was he the means of sending it—I asked him if it was his confession and he said No —in the course of conversation I told him we had been robbed for a length of time—he said he partly knew that George who had lived there had carried on a robbery for some time and that he was coming from his work one evening and a strange man in the street tapped him on the shoulder and took him into a public-house—they had some beer together and he said that they could do some business together and that George had often done business with the man and he had thrown goods out of the loop-hole and the man had taken them away—I afterwards saw Warner and showed him the letter—we missed 1cwt of currants as soon as were apprised of the loss on Tuesday the 5th of April—we had taken stock on the 2nd Cross-examined Q How many persons have you in your warehouse A Five porters—I was at home on the 5th—between on 2nd and 5th was sold 7cwt of currants—there was 23cwt in the stock on the Saturday and instead of 16cwt remaining there were only 15cwt —Warner has been about five years in our service—we sometimes mark our bags and sometimes not—I should not know them all—some are marked O and some P —we do not mark them at all except to distinguish what currants are in them MR BODKIN Q Are they put into bags in this country or abroad A Here—the bags are returned to us OLIVER BECKET I am in the employ of Booth and Co it is my duty to see to the delivery of goods and that they are properly put up—I know what goods are sent out to customers—I do not know Harrod—he has not been a customer of ours—I sent out a sack of currants on the 2nd of April but no bag—I sent none to Harrod Cross-examined Q How long have you been in the employ A About two months—I have never sent out goods without taking an account of them—we deal in sugar and spices and several things—a great part of the bags are marked so that the house would know them—it is a private mark to know the difference of the quality of the fruit—we have P on one kind of bag and o on the other JAMES CHRISTOPHER EVANS I am an officer of the Thames-police In consequence of information my attention was directed to the shop of Harrod in Rosemary-lane—I had been watching the shop several evenings before the 2nd of April and was there on the 2nd of April about nine o clock with Luton—I saw Messrs Booth s cart come along Rosemary-lane—the name of the firm was painted on the front and on the side—it was a large open cart with a loose tilt over hoops—it hung down—warner was driving it—it stopped at Harrod s door—I saw warner to round the cart and lift up the tilt at the corner nearest to Harrod s door—he took a bag under his left arm and carried it into Harrod s shop—this was about a quarter past nine o clock in the evening it was quite dark—the place was lighted with gas and there were lights in the shop—he took it to the back part of the shop and pitched it on the floor opposite the front door—Harrod was behind the counter—I stood close to the door—it was a currant bag sewed at the end with two ears one at each corner—Harrod a is a grocer s shop—I have since seen some currant bags at the prosecutor s—the one I saw that night exactly corresponded with them—I gave Luton some directions and he went into the shop—I waited till he come out—he went in immediately after Warner had pitched the bag from his shoulder—warner drove the cart away—I kept my eye on the door to see that nothing was brought out and I am quite sure nothing was brought out—when I looked in again the hag was gone—I saw no money pass between Harrod and Warner—I saw him look towards him as if he said something and saw Harrod nod his bend but I could not hear what was said—no hill or any thing was given to Harrod—Moran and Warner were taken into custody on Saturday night the 16th of April but not by us—I was not at the Mansion-house at the first examination—I was on the Wednesday—I went to Harrod s house and was watching there for a whole week after Moran was in custody without effect—we did not take them into custody at first as we wanted to know if Harrod had any dealings with the prosecutor—I was endeavouring to find Harrod till the Friday week—on Tuesday the 19th if April I went and searched Harrod s house—he was not there then—I went on the 20th of April again and he was not at home—watched his place off and on till the 27th of April and that day Warner and Moran were discharged from the Mansion-house—I had not been able to find Harrod at all at his usual place before they were discharged Cross-examined Q Whether he was in the country on business you cannot tell A No—we had had some little private information—some hint that something wrong was going on but we were not directed to watch the house before the 2nd of April—I had said nothing to the prosecutor about that house before I went to watch it—I suspected all was not right and that somebody in Booth s employ was doing something wrong there—I would have taken warner and Harrod into custody if I had been certain of the case—on Tuesday the 19th of April the prosecutor applied for a search-warrant and we were obliged to execute it—I knew it was no use—I know some bags were brought away to the prosecutors warehouse for the clerks to examine the marks from his books but they did not belong to them MR BODKIN Q You waited there in consequence of private information A Yes—the prosecutor got a search-warrant from the Thames-police-office—that is the reason Harrod s premises were searched—the parties were apprehend without our knowledge in the City HENRY LUTON I am an officer of the Thames-police I was in company with Evans on the evening of the 2nd of April near the prisoner Harrod s house in Rosemary-lane—I saw the prosecutor s cart coming along—I went round the back of the cart and saw a bag partly covered over with the tilt—the cart then went on and stopped at Harrod s door and Warner took the bag under his left arm and went into Harrod s shop—I went into the shop and bought some tea in order to hear the conversation—Warner was coming out and said to Harrod This is all I have got for you to-night —Harrod replied That will do —I saw no money given for it nor any bill of parcels delivered nor any book produced to be signed—he walked in dropped it on the left-hand side and came out—I observed the bag and should suppose it to be about 1cwt by the fall of it—I am in the habit of portering and am a judge of weight—I have seen some bags of the same kind since the prosecutors warehouse and I can swear it was the same kind of bag Cross-examined Q Was the bag down in the middle of the shop A No—down on the counter on the right-hand side at the far end of the shop—it was gas-light—I saw Warner go in with the bag and followed him in—as he came out he met me in the face—I was dressed as I am now—this is not my Thames-police jacket—Warner must have seen I was observing him—there was nothing to prevent my seeing him MR BODKIN Q There was nothing to show you were an officer A No JAMES FOGG I am a Thames police-officer I received information about March of April which induced me to pay attention to Harrod s shop in Rosemary-lane—I had seen the prosecutor s cart stop at Harrod s shop on one occasion before the 2nd of April—Moran was not there at that time—I have seen Moran inside the shop and Warner outside at the same time several times—and Harrod was at home at those times talking to Moran—I once saw the cart stop there the shop was full of customers-Warner went into the shop on that occasion—I went behind the cart lifted the tilt up and felt a bag under the tilt—Moran was not there—Warner said something to Harrod and then came out and drove his cart away without leaving any thing there—that was three or four days before the 2nd of April—in consequence of what I heard I took Harrod into custody on the 2nd of May—I had been endeavouring to find him before that and searched his house on the 19th of April—he was not at home and I had been watching ever since at his house night and day and could not find him—after the discharge of Warner and Moran I went again to his house and then found him at home—I said Mr Harrod you must go with me —he said Step into the parlour mr Fogg —the parlour joins the shop—he said What is it for I suppose you heard that we searched your house the other day —he said Yes—I said Messrs Booth and Ingledew have been robbed to a great extent by their carman and warehouseman of pepper currants and many things and you have been receiving them —he said Oh consider my wife and family what am I to do come up-stairs and see my wife she is in bed —I said You may go up and see your wife but I cannot assist you you must to with me —when he got up-stairs he said Oh what am I to do can t you settle this thing —I said No —he said Such things have been done I know and I will give you 20l if you will let me run out of the house and I will never be seen in the neighbourhood any more or any thing you require —I said No you must go with me to of office —he said If I must I must and I took him there Cross-examined Q You have taken a great deal of trouble in the business A I have—it is not my business to get up the case—I have taken no trouble in getting witnesses—I swear that—I know Warner s wife—I have had no particular conversation with her since her husband was taken into custody—she was talking about the things at the office—I did not ask her to induce her husband to become a witness—not at the office or any where Q Have you ever said any thing of this kind to her If you don t prevail on your husband to confess I will make a convict of him A Never—Warner was kept in the officer s s room where there were twenty officers going in and out—I was in that room twenty times—I did not go in with her—she was there sitting with her husband—I might have gone in at the same time as her MR BODKIN Q How long have been an officer A Twenty years COURT to JOHN PRESTON Q You have described the cellar was there any thing to prevent Warner helping him self to the bag of currants A He could not have done it—the cellar-door was bolted and we never allow the carman on the premises—their business is to mind the horse and cart—the porters are at liberty to go all over the premises—it must be somebody connected with the premises to enable the carmen to get this—I had been on the watch for a fortnight in a water-closet with a hole to it at the time we had the suspicion—Moran came to the place where I was concealed when he was loading the cart to see if any body was on the watch and he found me there and went away without doing any thing—Moran s duty was to load the cart and he was alone—that duty is common to all the porters—he was the only porter at home on this occasion—there were two porters at home but one was at the crane at the top of the house—Moran in the common course of his duty would be there—the carman could not have got the currants himself Moran Q you recollect watching me you came up-stairs and asked me the reason why I should come to the water-closet A No—I asked you at the Compter—you put your hand there to see if any body was in the water-closet but you did nothing—I sent you down to hook on the barrels on the 19th Moran Q You came to the Compter and showed me the letter but would not give it me to read—I said I never authorized any body to write and you told me you finished taking stock on the 2nd of April and missed currants—I said I knew nothing about it A Yes I dont recollect you saying you were surprised the water-closet door was shut and begged pardon for opening it—you made some explanation about coming there when your was at the Compter—you were not sent out by us on the 2nd of April—you did not request me to bring a man to the Thomes police-office as a witness—you never told me to bring Mr Steel forward to prove where you were on the 2nd of April or I should have been very happy to have done so COURT Q Can you take on yourself to say he would in the course of his duty be the only person to assist in loading the cart on the 2nd of April A He would be the only person—it was not my duty to see the cart loaded OLIVER BECKET re-examined Moran and a man named John were employed to load the cart on the 2nd of April—John was at the crane at the top of the warehouse and Moran at the cart—I stood by at the time the cart was loaded with two hogsheads of sugar—when the sugar was put in I went away—I recollect Moran being there when the sugar was put in—it was the last load the cart took out that night Cross-examined Q There was nothing to prevent your seeing the cart go away A No—the carman had to come to me to settle and he did come to settle with me—I might have gone back with him and have seen what was in the cart if I chose—I did not know the currants were put into the cart—Moran went towards the cellar and would be able to hand any thing out to the cart as it stood just over the loop-hole of the cellar—he could go into the cellar open the door and put the currants up—I was on the first floor over the cellar—Warner could not do it without assistance from within—there are steps to get into the cellar Q Then was there any impossibility in Warner s going down to the cellar himself putting the sack on his back and walking up the steps with it A Yes—because Warner was outside and Moran was inside and the cellar door cannot be opened outside—you cannot get into the cellar without going into the warehouse—Warner could not have gone to the cellar without my seeing him—I would swear he did not go into the cellar—I saw Moran going towards the cellar Moran s Defence I am quite innocent GEORGE SELWOOD I am a confectioner and live at No 180 Tooley-Street I have been there a little better than two—was at the Thames police-office on Saturday the 7th of May and saw Fogg there and the wife of the witness Warner—I heard Fogg say to her If you don t prevail or persuade your husband to confess I will make a convict of him —I have not been in court to hear the evidence—I went out when first it came on—Harrod s brother was with me at the time—after what Fogg said the woman went into the little room adjoining the office with I think Mr Preston in which room Warner was sitting—that was about ten minutes after I heard the conversation—I can swear I heard the expression and I put it down just afterwards MR BODKIN Q What took you there A To hear the examination—I know Harrod s brother but not the prisoner—I think I have sees him—I had no dealings with him—I knew where he lived—I have been to his house about twice—I have only known him relative to this transaction—I have known there has been such a person—I did not know him before I went to the Thames police-office that day—he said there was a case coming on against his brother and asked me to go which I did on the Saturday—I thought it very unfair of the officers to endeavour to Intimidate—I knew Fogg was an officer of the establishment—I did not know I was entitled to give information of this to the Magistrate—I heard that examination and the one on Monday—I did not tell the magistrate because I had no knowledge that I had a right to do so or that I should be allowed to interfere—I mentioned it Mr Wooller after the committal—perhaps two days after—I accompanied the prisoner s brother to Mr Wooller—I spoke of it to Mr Harrod before that—I heard the magistrate commit him—I heard Fogg s evidence read over to him—It did not occur to me to mention this COURT Q What day was at in May you heard Fogg say this A On Saturday the 7th—I was there on Monay the 9th—Warner was not examined on the 7th—I do not think he was but I am not quite sure JOHN PHESTON I was examined on the 9th of May not before—there was no examination on the 7th WILLIAM FREDERICK HARROD I am the prisoner s brother and am a working jeweller living at No 129 Tooley-street Mr Selwood and I have been intimate some time—I was with him at the Thames police-office On Saturday the 7th of May when my brother was there under charge—I heard Fogg say to Mrs Warner that if she did not prevail on her husband to confess he would make a convict of him—Selwood was near enough to hear that—I went with him a day or two after to Mr Wooller and he communicated that expression to Mr Wooller MR BODKIN Q You did not hear the expression from your friend but you heard it yourself A Yes—Fogg spoke loud enough for any body to hear who was in the passage leading to the office—there was only the officer and Fogg and Evans in the passage besides us—I did not write it down—I was bout three yards off—I might have heard Selwood speak of it but we have not made it out conversation—I know Fogg—I did not speak to him at that time—I only recollect speaking on one occasion and that was at a public-house very near but I cannot tell the sign—I did not ask him to go and drink with me—I asked him to drink—that was on the first examination not on the 7th—there was an examination of the prisoner before the 7th—he was remanded twice—it was before I heard what Fogg said—I said to him then You need not have said what you did about my brother Q Did you not also on that occasion ask him to be as lenient to your brother as he could A I do not recollect such a thing passing—I cannot swear it did not—I do not recollect his saying he must of his duty—I do not recollect any answer that he made—I cannot swear I did not ask him to be lenient to my brother—I have no recollection of its passing—I believe it did not—I cannot swear it—it was after that that this conversation took place MR PHILLIPS Q All you admit saying to him was that he need not have said what he did A Yes that was all that passed I believe—I was present when Selwood said what I have stated to Mr Wooller COURT to GEORGE SELWOOD Q When you heard those words which you thought sufficiently important to take a note of did you tell Mr Harrod the brother what you had heard on the spot A I told him so at the time—I said Did you hear that and repeated what I had heard—I wrote down what I heard in the evening but not in his presence COURT to W F HARROD Q Did not you say it was not reaped to you but you heard it yourself A Yes I heard it myself—it was spoken of that we heard it—I do not know whether Selwood said Did you here that —I observed to him Did you hear that conversation of Fogg the officer —I observed it to him and he to me—I do not know whether Fogg heard us—we were about two or three yards distant—we spoke in the ordinary tone—Fogg was speaking to the woman and might not have heard us and then the woman approached towards us—it might be possible he might not hear the woman said something to him respecting one man was the same to her as another and that put an end to the possibility of my hearing further conversation—Fogg might have heard what we said JAMES FOGG re-examined I knew the man had made a confession before the examination—I was aware of that before I attended at the office—the witness Harrod asked me to be as lenient with his brother as I could and asked me to take something to drink—there is not a word of truth in what the witnesses have said with respect to my observation to Mrs Warner—here is the officer who was present—I heard Selwood say to Harrod s brother Did you hear that —and I can explain what it was—two women were talking to Warner s wife—I said Go away from these women have nothing to do with them they will get your husband transported go away from them into the room COURT Q Why would they get her husband transported A they were persuading her I think not to let her husband come forward James Baker a surgeon of Dorchester-place New North-road William Mason a draper of Fore-street Richard Burton a silk-manufacturer of Wood-street Cheapside Charles Edward Walker of London-road south-wark James Bateman a carpenter and builder of Dorchester-place New North-road William Carter a wholesale coffee-dealer of Barbicas James Bower a linen-draper John P Searle

t18360613-1436  1436 JOHN HAYDON was indicted for stealing on the 25th of January at St Pancreas 1 purse value 2s 2 £10 and 4 £5 Bank-notes the goods and monies of Elizabeth Beaumont his mistress and CHARLES CHUCK for feloniously receiving the same well knowing them to be stolen against the Statute &c MR RIDDEL conducted the Prosecution MISS ELIZABETH BEAUMONT I am single and live at No 12 Euston-place Euston-square On the 25th of January about three o clock I hired a glass-coach from Mr Tipping in the Mews nearly opposite my house—the prisoner Haydon was the driver—he drove to Southampton-street Strand—I waited there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I went to Messrs Walfords the attorneys there and then drove home again—on arriving at home I went into the house and almost immediately after the servant brought a message to ask me to permit Haydon to go home to get some horse-cloths—I assented to that—he was not absent more than a quarter of an hour I think—on going up-stairs I missed my purse but did not mention it to him on his return—it contained two £10 notes and four £5 notes—I had seen it safe at Mr Walford s—I had my purse in my hand in my muff—I did not mention my loss to the servant—my niece went out to search the carriage but I was not present—I drove to my sister s in York-place and then went back to Mr Walford s to inquire if I had left the purse there and then I mentioned it to the prisoner—he was asked if he had seen it—he said he had not seen any thing of it at all—I the drove to Mr Hayward s in Buckingham-street—he was out and I wrote a note telling him of the loss—I cannot exactly remember whether he came home while I was there but I got into the coach and returned to my own house—I told the prisoner at the door that I would give him 10l if he would restore my purse and money—he said he had not seen it and used on oath—I hired the coach again next day and the prisoner drove it—Mr Tipping s son was present and I told him to say I thought the purse must have been found in the carriage and if he would restore it I would give him 10l —the prisoner declared he had not seen it—Mr Hayward called at my house the same evening the 25th—I had received the notes from him on the 22nd —I did not know the numbers of them but Mr Hayward took a pencil memorandum of the numbers in my presence when he paid them to me Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When had you examined the contents of your purse A Previous to my going out I put the notes into the purse—I had other notes in my possession but they were in my dressing-case quite separate from these—the notes I received from Mr Haywood on the 22nd were not mixed with others—I kept them separates from any other notes—I put them into my purse the morning I went out in the coach—I know there was 40l —I had not examined them not to know them again—I know I put four £5 and two £10 notes into my purse—I know I ascertained the amount because I had money to pay—I had not used my purse between the time of my going out with the prisoner and missing it—I had no necessity for money—I had not got to the place where I was to use the notes—I was going to Oxford-street after going to Mr Walford s—they money was in a small green purse not in a reticule—My impression is that I did not drop the purse till I got into the carriage—I think the last place I felt it in my hand was at Mr Walford s door coming out—I am sure I felt there—I do not think it possible that I dropped it from my muff—after I missed it I went to my sister told her of my loss and asked her advice—she said before she asked him if he had picked the purse up in the carriage she would have me go to Mr Walford and ask if I had left it there—I think the prisoner has driven me before—I never saw the notes again till I was at the police-office—Haydon was taken the next evening and was afterwards discharged—he was only taken twice MARIA SAUNDERS I am the prosecutrix s servant On 25th January my mistress hired a glass coach which the prisoner Haydon drove—she came home first I think between four and five o clock and the prisoner wished me to ask mu mistress to allow him to go away for half an hour to get cloths for the horses—mistress said Certainly but not to exceed half an hour—he was not absent above ten minutes or quarter of an hour—I heard mistress say she had lost her purse—I named it to Haydon—he said he knew nothing at all about it SAMUEL TIPPING I am a livery stable-keeper and lived in Southampton Mews Euston-square at the time in question—I now live in Alsop Mews The prisoner Haydon was in my service on the 25th of January but not Chuck—he had been in my service—on 25th of January I let a coach to the prosecutrix—Haydon drove it—it went from my yard between two and three o clock to the best of my recollection and came back between seven and eight o clock—on that evening I saw Mr Hayward at Miss Beaumont s house—he informed me of the loss—the prisoner did not some home for any horse-cloth that afternoon not till he came home in the evening for good—he had 12s a week—I paid his wife on the Saturday evening before the 23rd Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q He is a married man and has a family A He has one child—he was eleven months with me and behaved very well so that I promoted him to be coach-driver—I was in the yard from the time he left till he came home for good—he did not return for a horse-cloth—he might have returned with out the coach but I did not see him—I know a man named Cox—he has no access to the yard but at the front entrance—he drove one of my cabs at the time—he had access to all parts of the yard MR RIDDEL Q What time did Cox come home that night A To the best of my recollection between nine and ten o clock—he went away about eight o clock in the morning—Haydon could get at the horse-cloths without asking me—they are kept in different parts—I was about the stables the whole of the afternoon COURT Q If he had brought the carriage home you must have known it A I must—he might have come without it and clouded my observation MARGARET SMITH I am bar-maid at the Orange Tree Palace-row Euston-square On Sunday evening the 24th of January Haydon came to me and asked me to lend him 5s which I did—I saw him again on Monday the 25th—he was backwards and forwards from about seven o clock in the morning till between nine and ten o clock—I was serving in the bar from three o clock in the afternoon till between twelve and one—I did not see Haydon that afternoon and think he could not have come without my seeing him—I saw him next morning between nine and ten o clock—he gave me a sovereign to change and to take the 5s I had lent him—he was very sober then and quite collected Cross-examined Q On the Monday after three o clock you did not see him at the Orange Tree A I did not—I cannot swear he was not there but I believe he was not—I do not think he drank there COURT Q You said before you thought he could not come in without your seeing it A Hemight have drank outside the door—I did not think he could have come in without my seeing him PHILIP HAYWARD I am a solicitor and live at No 14 Buckingham-street Strand I know the prosecutrix—I recollect paying her £60 in January last—I have a memorandum of the notes which I made at the time I paid her— reads Two £10 Nos 7961 and 2 dated 4th December 1835 four £5 No 29601-2-3 and 29750 all dated the 7th of December 1835 —I also paid her two £10 notes No 7163 and 4 but those she paid away—I had received these notes from Martin Stone and Martin that day—I went to the house on the 25th and saw her in the evening—from what she stated I sent for Mr Tripping and also for Haydon who was there at the same time as Tripping—I asked Haydon if he had seen any thing of the notes which were lost—he said he knew nothing about it—I asked him where he went to when he went away—he said he went to Mr Tipping s yard for cloths for the horses—Mr Tipping denied that—he then said he went to Mr Smith at the Orange Tree to get a pint of beer and bread and cheese—somebody went out to know if he had been there—a message was brought back that he had not—he still persisted that he knew nothing of the notes and they left—next morning I went of the Bank and stopped the payment of the notes—on Friday evening the 29th of January I received a notice from the Bank—I went there and from information I received there I went to Jones and Lloyds and then to Shoolbred and Cook Tottenham-court road and saw one of the partners—the first notice was about a £10 note—I subsequently received a notice of a £5 note which I traced through Smith Payne and Smith s hands JAMES NELSON I am a clerk in the accountant s office in the Bank of England I produce two £10 notes and four £5 notes—the £10 are No 7961 and 2 dated the 4th of December 1835 and the £5 are Nos 29601 2 3 and 29450 all dated December 1835—they each came into the Bank at different times through different

the note—he left a bundle of cloth with me the same day and asked me to keep it for him which I did till I gave it to Collier the policeman— looking at the £5 note No 29601 this is the note—it has my writing on it Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Had you know Chuck before A He has been in the habit of coming in and out—I knew him by the name of Chuck—I asked him what name I should put—he said Chuck—you will know where to find me Miss I shall be on the rank —that is all that passed—I had know him a month or two GEORGE PITT I am shopman to Shoolbred and Co of Tottenham-court-road On the 26th of January Chuck came to out shop with a tailor whom I had seen before—he bought sufficient cloth to make a pair of trowsers and two waistcoats and tendered a £10 note in payment—I changed it and market my initials on it and his address— looking at a £10 note I have written Chuck 1 Pancras-street T C R for Tottenham-court-road—I asked his name and he gave me that name and address—I had seen him on one occasion before—I first brought him change for a £5 note by mistake instead of£10—he said This is will not do we have to work too hard for them —I have no doubt of him Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you recollect him when he came into your shop at first A I did—he had been in the shop three or four months before and bought some cloth—I went with other parties and saw the person who lived at No 1 Pancreas-street but I did not go to No I myself EDWARD COCKS I lodge at No 37 —St Pancras I know the prisoners—I saw both of them on the 25th of January—I saw Haydon about eight o clock in the evening at Mr Tipping s yard—nobody else was present—he said he wanted to speak to me and told me he had found some notes—he showed them to me and I looked at them—there were two £10 notes and four £5 notes—he then asked me to pass them for him—I told him I did not know any thing about the notes and would note pass them—I told him to keep them for a few days and there would be a reward offered for them—he said that would not do that he had been driving a lady who had dropped them that he had been with Mr Tipping to the lady and made it all right and there was no suspicion that he had them—I then took the notes to Chuck and stated the case to him exactly as Haydon did to me—Chuck said that it was all right he could pass them—that he knew a gentleman in the Strand who bought notes—I then gave Chuck a £5 note which he changed at his lodging—I went to him next morning—he said the gentleman in the Strand has something to do with the Custom-house affair and would have nothing to do with the notes—that he passed a £10 note at Shoolbred s in Tottenham-court-road a £5 note at the Little Gun in Norton-street and a £5 note was a lost in London-street—I don t know where the

there six weeks—I then had information that every thing was all right and returned—I was apprehended on the 8th of May I think by Collier COURT Q You never told all this till you were taken up A No Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q And you ran away for the purpose of avoiding being taken up A Yes I then accused them of it—they turned on me first—I tried to save myself of course—Chuck told me he

breeches and waistcoat of—I did not have it—I never saw it—I wanted on the other side of the street while Chuck went into Shoolbred s—I went with him—on my oath I did not have the cloth—I thought I should be taken when they were in custody and ran away—I was never in custody before GEORGE COLLIER I am a policeman and live at No 9 Brunswick-street New-road I took Chuck into custody on the 2nd of February—Haydon was at that time in custody for this offence—they were remanded five times and Cocks being out of the way both were discharged—I took Cocks afterwards about two o clock in the morning of the 8th of May in Tottenham-court-road—I afterwards took Haydon at five o clock the same morning and he said I suppose it is about the notes adding that he knew nothing about them he was as innocent as a child unborn—I was present at the apprehension of Chuck about nine o clock the same morning and he said it was now all up with him now Cocks was taken and pointing with his finger to his neckcloths he said This young gentleman will be lagged —I got a parcel of cloths from Summers for a pair of trowsers and two waistcoats Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q About how long was it after Chuck was discharged the first time that he was taken again A Five or six weeks I should think—I do not know whose service he was in—he was driving a night-coach out of a yard in Carburton-street—I have seen him a hundred times since the robbery Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Was Haydon apprehended in the employ of Mr Tipping A No—he was working for another master MR RIDDEL Q Do you know where Chuck lived A Yes—at no 8 Pancras-street—it is a corner house—not at No 1—I believe he lived there up to the time I took him—I know he lived there in February when I took him first GEORGE PITT re-examined This cloth is what I sold for the note GEORGE THORNTON I am a policeman I took Chuck on the 8th and told him Haydon and Cocks were in custody—he pointed to himself and said This young gentleman will be lagged The prisoner Chuck put in a written defence stating that Cocks had asked him to go to Shoolbred s with him to purchase the cloth as he had been in the habit of dealing there that he called Norman a tailor out of the Gun public-house and they went there together where Cocks gave him the note to purchase the cloth on coming out he gave him the cloth and change he took him to the Gun where he left the bundle and Cocks got him to change the £5 note with the landlady next day he offered him more notes to change which he refused having his suspicions that he used the expression alluded to on his second apprehension conceiving Cocks capable of convicting him by perjury to save himself Thomas Mansfield hackney-coach proprietor Hampstead-road and John Halford shoe-maker Doyley-street deposed to Haydon s good character and Ann Whiting Pancreas-street Tottenham-court-road and William Halliwell publican Clipston-street St Marylebone to that of Chuck CHUCK—

recommendation of Pfliler a person in my employment and he continued three or dour months—in the early part of August I heard reports that my quires of works were sold as waste paper—on the 19th I took the prisoner into custody with an officer at his house High-street Marylebone before going I went over the warehouse and missed 1793 quires worth 300l —I told the prisoner I had come to apprehend him on charge of robbing my warehouse—he said I am quite innocent oh dear me how could I do it when you always kept the key —he said no more then—I then left him in presence of the officer—he was in bed—after a short time he called me to him and said Oh Mr Kernot I suppose I shall never see England again —I keep one of the keys of the warehouse and permit no one to use that—Pfliler had another keys—I have received some of the lost works back form Joseph Mahon and some from Goodwin Jeffreys and Wright Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Who are Treutel and Wurtz A They are booksellers in Paris—they have not been bankrupts—Mr Richter was in partnership with them in the London house—he failed after they relinquished partnership and these books were removed from New Bond-street—none of mine were covered with flannel nor of Treutel and Wurtz s nor of Richter s that I know of—I live in Russell-street in private apartments—one or two copies were there—I did not employ the prisoner to conceal any of them—I was first heard of his robbing me on the 12th of August—I was not angry because I did not give credit to it but I did on the next day—of course I should not think of employing him in any confidential business after that—that I swear—nor did I seek to employ him—this letter is my hand writing addressed to the prisoner dated 7th of August Q Did you write this reading If you return soon I can promise a good deal of work for Mr Richter s affairs are quite settled I shall have in a few days 3000 volumes all at once from his assignees A I did write that—from the 13th up to the 19th I was going to all the haunts to the prisoner to find him out and from the 13th till the morning of the 19th I could not and therefore I wrote that to the put him off his guard Q Did you write this to him Now do not be foolish in keeping away from your friends and well wishers to whom always believe me one —A I did say so to mislead him—it was my intention to take him up and have him tried—he was not confidential with me—there is a dispute between Richter s assignees and Treutel and Wurtz but not about the books in question—I often sign myself Harry but my name is Henry MR CLARKSON Q You could not find him till the 19th A No 1 found him at his own house—this letter was directed to the Orange Tree New-road where his wife told me he often was—this was nothing else but a subterfuge to get hold of him—this property was in my custody in the warehouse JOHN WILLIAM LEGGATT police constable E 156 On Friday the 19th of August I accompanied the prosecutor to the prisoner s house in High-street and found him in bed and took him into custody—Mr Kernot left the room—the prisoner said he could not imagine what could induce him to be so foolish as to be guilty of such an act I asked now he could dispose of such a large quantity of paper—he said he disposed of it at different times to three people Mr Mahon in the Borough Mr Mahon in the Waterloo-road and Mr Gosbell—I went the house of Mr Mahon in Blackman-street Borough—Mr Kernot who was with me stated what we came for and he delivered to us 56 1/2 lbs of paper—from that house he took us to the house in Waterloo-road and delivered to us 46lbs —we went to Mr Drury and received 146lbs some more from Mr Jeffryes and 41 1/2lbs from Mr Wright THOMAS MAHON I am a stationer in the Waterloo-road On the 8th of July I saw the prisoner about six o clock in the evening—he had a man with him who appeared to be a porter and some paper with him—the prisoner asked if I would buy some waste paper—I said I would if I knew it was his property—he said it was—I asked him who he was—he took out his pocket book and handed me and enamelled card with the name of Mr Kernot on it—he wrote that dress—I bought lqr and 13lbs of him and I gave him 32s per cwt —it came to 11s 8 1/2 d—I believe some of it was entire works—I never collated it—after that he intimated there was a large quantity where he resided which was on the card I think No 17 Great Marylebone-street between two and three tons—I informed him I would be a customer—on the following evening I bought 1qr 14lbs for 11s 8 1/2d —he brought two other quantities the following week—I bought them—I think one was 1qr 17lbs the other 2qrs and some odd pounds—I paid at the same rate—most of it went to my brother in Blackman-street—I sold it to him—I went to my brother the same evening to ascertain whether it was a bona fide transaction or not and for him to make inquires of the publisher which was I believe in Soho-square—that was the first evening—I agreed that the prisoner should bring a further quantity on the Saturday evening that I might arrange with my brother whether I ought to buy it or not as it was a dirty common inferior paper—I had not any of it when Mr Kernot came—I had delivered it up to my brother two or three days after I got it—the prisoner said he had sold Gosbell the two ton lot Cross-examined Q How did you find out the name of the publishers A From the title-page—I did not go Treutel and Wurtz s—I believe my brother did to No 31 Soho-square JOSEPH MAHON I am brother to Thomas Mahon and live in Blackman-street On the 22nd of

live at York-place Islington and am a stationer I know the prisoner—I bought of him in sheets and half sheets about 3cwt 1qr of paper at the rate of 30s a cwt —I do not know whether the works were entire—I merely turned up the edges—I went by accident to dine with the prisoner at Mr Peek s in the New-road—I asked him who he was—he gave me his address James Claire High-street Marylebone —they

t18360919-2154  2154 JAMES KING was indicted for stealing on the 14th of September 144 glass bottles value 1l 19s and 2 baskets value 2s the goods of John Richards and another his masters and JOSEPH TAME and JAMES SMITH were indicted for feloniously receiving the same well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c —Another COUNT for feloniously receiving of an evil-disposed person well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c MESSRS BODKIN and CHAMBERS conducted the Prosecution HENRY CHARLES BARKER police-constable H 26 On the 14th of September I was set to watch in Goodman s-yard which runs from the Minories into Prescott-street—I observed a van of Mr Richards s driven by the prisoner King about half-past four o clock coming in a direction towards the Minories—twelve prickles were in it—he stopped at the stable belonging to Mr Tame—when he came opposite the stable he gave the reins to a little boy who was sitting on the van with him and he got down he then went behind to the tail of the van and took out the hindmost prickle on the near side—he took it on his back and carried it up between two dead walls to Mr Tame s stable door—the prisoner Smith stood at the stable door and helped him with it off his back—it was taken into Mr Tame s stable—Smith gave him an empty prickle—he brought that out and put it into the van and drove away—I watched him—when he got to Petticoat-lane he again gave the reins to the boy got into the van and began to take bottles out of the other prickles and put them into the empty one—I followed him on to Messrs Richard s—he afterwards went with an empty van to Irongate Wharf—I watched him from there with a full van again to the same place—he came away with twelve prickles and again went to Goodman s-yard—he stopped and gave the reins to the boy and got down he took the hindmost prickle as before put it on his back and went to the stable—I could see into the stable—I saw a man there whom I believe to be Tame but I could not swear to him harnessing a horse—after this full prickle had been carried in King brought out an empty one and moved the hind one and put that behind it—I watched the van the second time and saw the same thing occur again—I followed the van to Mr Richards s were-house the second time—I then tapped King on the shoulder and side You have been robbing your master of bottles —he said What —I told him he had been robbing his master—I took him into the counting-house and told Mr Richards what I had seen—he gave him into custody—the cart arrived at Goodman s-yard at half past-four or a quarter to five o clock—I afterwards went to Tame s house with Mr Richards and three officers—I took Tame—he was standing at the door—that was about half-past six o clock—the road from the Ironagte Wharf to Mr Richards s is not through Goodman s-yard—it is not much out of the way—it was not the direct way Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Were you employed by Mr Richards to watch this man A No—I was sent by the Inspector—I went in plain clothes—I had no communication with Mr Richards before this—when the first prickle was taken no one was there but Smith at Tame s stables—when I asked Tame if his name was Tame he said Yes —I did not know him before—I seached his stable—I could not see what kind of bottles were conveyed from the van on the first occasion—I could see they were bottles—I was about fifty or sixty feet from the stable door—they were in an open basket and appeared to me to be large glass bottles—this was all in broad day-light—I could not tell whether they were old or new—I searched the following morning—Tame was then in custody and saw most of what took place—I asked Tame about the loft and heard him say something about straw Cross-examined by MR CHURCHILL Q When the tail-board was taken down how was the horse standing A Towards Prescott-street—that is not an unusual way of unloading a cart—the two walls are eight feet apart so that he could not have driven the cart down there—the van was the usual height about seven feet—I was standing on no eminence—I was able to see the prickles because they stood above the van—I was thirty of forty yards from him when I saw him changing the bottles—I am confident I saw him shifting the bottles out of the prickles into this one JAMES RICHARDS I am in partnership with my father His name is John—our premises are in Raven-row Spitalfields—we deal in bottles to a considerable extent-we take the whole that one manufacturer makes in the north—on the 11th of September I spoke to the police and desired an officer to be stationed at Goodman s-yard—King was carman from five to seven year—on that day there was a vessel unloading at the Irongate Wharf containing bottles and among others beer-bottles—King was sent with our van that day to fetch loads off that wharf not beer-bottles only—he went six or seven times before any communication was made to me—we have a clerk at the wharf to see the prickles property loaded—six dozen of beer-bottles should he in each prickle and twelve prickles in a van—that is the proper ordinary load—about five o clock that afternoon I received a communication from the officer Barker—in consequence of that King was taken and brought to our counting-house—my father gave him in charge—he was told he was taken into custody for delivering bottles at Tame s stables—he said he knew nothing about it—I went to Tames s—he is a wine-cooper and bottle-marchant—his house is in Prescott-street—he has a warehouse in Goodman s-yard and a stable there—we found him at his door—Barker asked him if his name was Tame—he said My name is Tame —the officer was in plain clothes—he said I must take you into custody for receiving bottles stolen from Mr Richards —he said What bottles I know nothing about any bottles —I then went to the stable—Them went with me in custody—I asked him Have you a loft —he said Yes I have — What is in it —he said Nothing but hay and straw —I said We must search it —Smith was found at the stable and taken and a man named Butler was taken but discharged the same evening—we went up stairs into the loft—I did not minutely search it that evening but I found a large bin of bottles and ascertained they were our property—I drew samples from various parts of the bin—I did not examine every bottle—I have brought samples from the bottles in our bulk and from what were found there my belief is that there cannot be a doubt on the mind of any one after looking at them that they are the same—the greater portion of them were made at one particular manufactory and no other bottles are permitted to be sent from there to any other person in town—they are under a heavy penalty not to do it—the samples are here—the bottles found in that bin were wine-bottles—they were different sorts disposed in different layers and of two different manufactories—the ship they were unloading that bin what day was from our manufacturer—we found different qualities—we had vessels unloading the day before and on the Wednesday—King had been employed in carting these bottles and we found them placed in the bin in the same order that King had to remove them from the ship from two different vessels—that bin was not covered over—we found a variety of other bottles on a subsequent search on the premises—we found some that had the bloom on them at his house and in the loft—they had not been used—there is no way of restoring that bloom—we send no bottles out with that bloom on them—they are all washed and cleaned—there are six bottles of one sort to the gallon and some four—we found some we call pale claret bottles which I believe are of a shape and quality peculiar to our house—they are designed for Bucellas and pale brandy—this is one that we found and this is one from our warehouse—the bloom is produced by the sulphur that comes from the coals—we remove it by vitriolic acid and water—it is a difficult thing to remove—103 dozen bottles were found on Tame s premises—I received information which led me to the house of James Goss shipchandler and exporter of wine beer and spirits—I found twenty-four dozen bottles there of the kind that were landed on the 14th and which King was employed to convey-that would be the quantity contained in four prickles—King had been seven times that day I think—I afterwards counted the quantity of beer-bottles in the stock at our warehouse and found a deficiency of twenty-four dozen corresponding with the quantity found at Goss s Cross-examined by MR CHURCHILL Q Were you at your warehouse all that day A Yes—I did not send King—he knew it was his duty to go—I ordered him the evening previous and not that day—the freight is paid by us—it had not been paid at the time of King s apprehension—it is always paid when the cargo is told out and delivered Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q The only means you have of knowing your bottles is from the confidence you have in the manufacturer A No the particularity of their shape quality and colour—I have never seen others like them—my transactions in the trade are to some extent and the produce of most glass-houses in the kingdom come under my observation in the course of a year—I never send any bottles out with the bloom on them to any customers in London—we are in the habit of exchanging bottles sometimes with other warehouses and then they these pale bottles that they could not have come into the prisoner s hands in that way—we found six dozen of the pale claret bottles at the prisoner s—they were unloaded from the same ship on the Monday and they came from our manufacturer—unless they break their contract it is impossible they can come into other people s hands—the vessel which was unloading was employed solely in bringing these bottles—it is chartered by our house—I identify the bottles found at Mr Goss s by their corresponding in every respect with the others that we received—I had not seen them before they were at Mr Goss s—I found twenty-four dozen deficient in our stock which had not been delivered that day COURT Q Were the prickles delivered at your premises A Yes—their contents were twenty-four dozen short MR BALLANTINE Q Tame side he had nothing but hay and straw in the loft A Yes—he has a stuttering voice—I understood him fully—he has a sort of hesitating way of speaking—I am quite sure he said that—I did not take it down ISAAC WOODHAM I am foreman to Messrs Richards I have been in their employ twenty years—I was at Irongate Wharf on the 12th 13th and 14th of September superintending the unloading of two vessels of bottles—on the 12th I was unloading part of the Dutton—King acted as carman—he conveyed thirteen loads that day—among them was one load of pale claret bottles—on the 13th the Isabella Sarah was unloaded—King brought the loads home—bottles from a different manufactory were unloaded then—on the Wednesday I went again to the Dutton—he took nine turns four times with beer bottles three full loads and once two prickles—I saw some of the bottles found at Mr Goss s—I compared them with the bulk on board the Dutton and the other from Mr Goss s—I have seen the claret bottles found in the loft and also on board the vessel—they correspond and are from the same bulk—I was present every time when King s van was loaded—I saw the bottles counted—I am sure each time there were twelve prickles containing six dozen in each when they were quart bottles—I saw the prickles with my string—it is a peculiar string and my own tie Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Is it unusual at all for persons to have prickles of another house at their places A They change them sometimes at the wine merchants—I cannot say whether we had other prickles with other people s names on them at that time—we generally mend the prickles up a day or two before they go to the vessels—I have tied them up ever since I have been there—each man can tell his own tie—the prickle that contained the claret bottles was my tie—I know it had not been tied months before by the newness of the string—some of them were new prickles that we had home the day before—the prickles were never used till the Tuesday they were used on board the Isabella Sarah—I cannot tell whether they went with wine bottles or beer bottles—I know the prickles found at Mr Tame s to be those I had sent on the Tuesday and Wednesday because they were particular prickles with red bands and white rods round them—I do not know any other house that used this string—it has four ends to it and is made by a particular person for us—we buy it of Mr Hammond—he does not make such string for other people—I have never seen it on the prickles of other merchants—it is the practice of some particular houses to interchange bottles—the wine merchant likes them dry if he can get them Cross-examined by MR CHURCHILL Q Was the Dutton close to shore A Yes JAMES GOSS I am a ship-chandler and Irish provision merchant The front of my premises is in the Minories and there is a communication to it from America-square—the prisoner Tame deals in old bottles—a short time before the 14th of September I applied to him to furnish me with some beer bottles—he engaged to send me ten or twelve gross—he said they would he very regular and equal to any new bottles—the word regular means bottles that run of an equal size and second-hand bottles very often vary but we separate them and return the irregular ones—I think he said they were to be 32s but I bought them at 31s without discount—I am not exactly correct but I think that was 7s or 8s a gross less than new ones—I was not at home and I do not know when they came in Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Tame is a dealer in old bottles is he not what is called a wine-cooper A I believe he is—I do not know that he have necessity for new bottles—new once are always regular and old ones sometimes—there were to be old porter bottles—I did not see them as my servant took them in WILLIAM TOWN I am in the service of Mr Goss I was expecting some bottles to be sent from Mr Tame s—I went to his premises on the morning of Wednesday the 14th—I saw Tame and asked him what time he was going to send the bottles in—he said in the course of the afternoon or evening—I do not recollect that he said why he had not sent them—I was at my master s on the evening of that day and Tame brought two gross of bottles in a cart drawn by one horse—the same bottles were afterwards claimed by the prosecutor—they came in prickles—I did not notice whether they had been recently washed but in the morning I filled them—I then found they were wet—I did not notice any thing then but when I corked them I noticed one or two with the bloom on—I did not examine them all but this attracted my attention—they were delivered up to Messrs Richards Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How do you know it was Wednesday the 14th A I am certain of it—I made no memorandum of it there was a receipt signed I did not sign it—I filled them on Thursday and they were taken away on Saturday—we have a great many bottles—we buy them generally of one person—I received them as good regular bottles—I saw nothing particular in the shape of them—If I had seen them a week afterwards any where else I should not have known them MR RICHARDS re-examined Here is one from Mr Goss s premises and this is one from our own stock MR PAYNE Q Do you not think they differ in appearance A The colour may be different but they agree in identity of manufacture and finish—from practice I have acquired such a knowledge as to be able to swear to these two as coming from the same manufacture and the same mould Tame s Defence I am placed before this bar innocently on a case I do not know any thing at all about I am in the habit of buying new bottles as well as old—my trade is all over London and I buy bottles when I am short of other bottles merchants in the new way and also I get a great many from on board ships and there is no doubt but they come from the very same factory that Mr Richards s does When these bottles were received I was out very near the whole of the day I generally am everyday I keep at home three or four men to do my business while I am out bottling wine and attending wine-merchants I never bought a stolen bottle to my knowledge—I should be very sorry for my men to rob me and I would not encourage it in any one else—I am a wine and bottle-merchant Mr Snow a surgeon of Mile-end Robert Prendergast cellerman William Chillingworth wine-merchant of Cooper s-row Crutched-friars James Rowe hearth-rug maker Orange-street Richard Barnes licensed victualler George-street Minories Moses Magnus merchant Walter Baird merchant s clerk William Turner Stephen Simpson

sold 1lb of sugar and 1oz of tea and had given 9s change—I asked who he took it of—he said he could not tell—I said it was a bad half-sovereign and if he did not tell me who he took it of I would make

of the officers followed her—I remained in the room—the officer returned accompanied by a female servant and the prisoner—I told the other females not to own that box unless it was really her own—at first she said it was her box—that was before I gave her the caution—she then said Crane had told her to own it—Crane was present—the girl who came down fainted and Crane assistant her—Crane said the box was hers about the time the girl was fainting—I then examined the third box—it was locked—we opened it with a key which Crane gave to the other girl—I did not see that—I do not know that the other girl said where she got the key from—she had given me the key before she fainted when she came down and said it was her box—I found in that box the articles stated REBECCA HARVEY In September last I was in the service of Sir Hugh Munro in Manchester-square as parlour maid and am still in the service—Crane was there as Cook—on the day on which the officers came there I was up stairs—the prisoner came to me in the bed-room—she said the constables were below for things that had been stolen and she had a box on the table with some things in it she did not know what they were but she wished me to own it—I told her I could not own it and she begged me then to unlock it for her—she had a bunch of keys in her hand—she showed me the key that would undo the box and in coming down I missed the key—I did not know it when I came down—I did not speak to her but she put the keys into my hand—when I got into the room I found a box on the table—it was not mine—I had not a thing in the room—it was hers—I saw her bring it there about a fortnight before—I have seen Holmes at Sir Hugh Munro s two or three times—I saw him there the day before this search took place in the evening—I was not when he came but he used to come to see Crane DANIEL PAMPLET I accompanied the prosecutor to the house in Manchester-square—when Crane went to fetch the person down who she said belonged to the box I followed her—she went across the yard and up stairs—I heard her say to Harvey Unlock the box and own it or to that effect—I did not see her give her any thing but I heard some key rattle JOSEPH RAILTON re-examined These articles were found in the box and are our property—here is foreign lace blond lace and some British lace some satin and velvet plain silk Irish linen silk stockings French cambric lace ribbon and worked muslins for trimming—the value of all found in the box is 46l at coat price—I have missed property of this description—this velvet we missed from our stock—it cost 1l a yard Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Have you a private mark on these things A On many of them—here is one on this and this as well—I compared this velvet with the piece it was cut from—it corresponds exactly—if it had been sold there would have been no other appearance about it—not one customer in a hundred would buy so much muslin as eighteen yards—there is a good deal of this velvet about town REBECCA HARVEY re-examined Crane told me Holmes was employed at Mr Railton s—I was only a fortnight in the house—he was in the habit of calling—I asked who he was—she told me a shopman at Mr Railton s JOHN MONUMENT I live at No 14 Great Chesterfield-street Marylebone—I know the two prisoners—in June last they took a room of me—they were both together—they continued to rent the room down to the time they were taken into custody—Crane slept in the room herself and Holmes used occasionally to call and sleep with her—she was out of a situation at that time—about a fortnight before she was taken she went to Sir Hugh Munro s—I did not see her at the lodgings while she was there but I understand she was there ELIZA JOHNSON I lodge at Mr Monument s Crane employed me to make two pairs of sheets for her last August—I did so—these are them MR RAILTON These sheets have my mark on them CRANE— GUILTY —Recommended to mercy Transported for Seven Years HOLMES— NOT GUILTY

t18361212-301  301 JOHN BARRETT was indicted for stealing on the 9th of November 1 sovereign and 1 half-sovereign the monies of the Lambeth Waterworks Company his masters —2nd COUNT stating them to be the monies of Thomas Casey MR FISH conducted the Prosecution THOMAS CASEY I am Clerk to the Lambeth Water-works Company It is my duty receive money from persons who come to pay water-rates—I am answerable to the company for the money I receive—on the 8th of November I marked nine sovereigns and three half-sovereigns in the presence of Mr Nelthorpe the secretary— looking at some this is part of the money I marked—there is a cross between the D in the figures—after marking them I placed them in this tin box which has a patent Bramah lock—there were 20s 6d in silver in it—I locked the box and took the key away with me at two o clock in the afternoon leaving the box with Mr Nelthorpe who resides at the office—I went there next morning at nine o clock and saw Mr Nelthorpe take the box out of my desk—it was locked—I handed him the key he unlocked it and a sovereign and a half were missing—money has repeatedly been taken away and I was obliged to account every Saturday evening for all water-rates received by me Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Do you mean to say you received all this money yourself A I did—Mr Nelthorpe did not receive any of it—I never said I marked ten sovereigns and two half-sovereigns—I did not say so before the Magistrate— looking at his deposition this is my writing but when my deposition was taken before the clerk a Union-hall he made the error and before the Magistrate I objected to it—he said Sign your name I will after it and I thought he had done so but it appears he has not—I said before the Magistrate Nine sovereigns and three half-sovereigns —I cannot say whether I said one pound and sixpence or twenty shilling and sixpence—I had two keys to the box—one I carried with me and left the other at my house JOSEPH NELTHORPE I am secretary to the Lambeth Water-works Company I was present on the 7th when the money was marked and on Tuesday the 8th I saw the marks and put them into the cash-box—this sovereign and half-sovereign part are of it—there were nine sovereign and three half-sovereigns marked and put into it—I gave the key to my clerk Thomas Casey—the box was put into Casey s desk the lock of which was imperfect and wanted repairing and it was not locked—Casey came about nine o clock next morning—I told him to get the box and put it on my desk which he did—he gave me the key and I opened it I believe and a sovereign and a half were deficient from the marked money—I saw the prisoner in the office about one o clock that day—I believe nobody was present but the policeman and himself but the clerk and others case in two or three minutes—I told him to lay all the money he had in his pockets on the table before the policeman—he did so and there were I think two sovereigns besides this sovereign and a half-sovereign and some silver—I examined it and found this sovereign and half-sovereign were those I had marked—I desired the policeman to take him into an inner room and examined him and in about five minutes he came out of the room and produced a key which he tried and it opened the cashbox instantly much easier than the right key—the prisoner has been in the service of the company five years and three quarters—he has been my house-servant as well and knew the house perfectly well—the box was always kept under lock and key by Mr Casey—it was purchased for the exclusive use of the company s money for the balance left there at night—all the sovereigns and half-sovereigns were similarly marked Cross-examined Q Did you give this money to Casey to mark A No—I told him to mark what money there was on Monday afternoon—Mr Casey is paid by the company but he is under my control—I was at the police-office when he was examined—the clerk made a mistake in the number of sovereigns in Casey s deposition which I told him was not correct and he said he would alter it—I rather think he made same mistake with regard to the umber of sovereigns in my deposition—I did not desire any error in mine to be corrected—I do not recollect that ten sovereigns was read over to me—it was the company s money—there was also 20s in silver besides the gold in the box COURT Q Do the company take the money into their possession at all till the clerk accounts for it A Not at all—they had no key of it—Casey was answerable for the contents of the box—the money arose from little bealances from the water-rates which it was not worth while to take to the banker s—we pay it in when it amounts to between 10l and 20l —the company are incorporated by Act of Parliament producing the Act MR PHILLIPS Q As Casey is your clerk do not you account for the money to the company A It is accounted for through me JAMES MILLAN I am the office porter in the service of the company On the morning of the 9th of November between seven and eight o clock I had occasion to go into the office—there was no one there when I went in—while there I let the prisoner into the house and he went into the office—he was there about ten minutes—I did not go in with him—there was no other person went in when he was there Cross-examined Q You did not go into the office yourself at all A Not when he went in—I went in before he came out and found him there—he went away directly I went in—I did not see him do any thing THOMAS WHITEHEAD police-constable L 103 I was at the company s office on the 9th of November with Mr Nelthorpe and a stranger was there—the prisoner came in—Mr Nelthorpe called him forward and desired him to empty his pockets—I also desired him to do so—he produced two sovereigns one half-sovereign and some silver—Mr Nelthorpe looked at them and identified a sovereign and half-sovereign as the marked money—there was no opportunity of substituting other money for it—this is the sovereign and half-sovereign which the prisoner produced from his pocket—they have been in my custody ever since—the marks were pointed out to me at the time he produced them—I found this key in his waistcoat pocket which opened the box Cross-examined Q How long were you opening it A I suppose two or three minutes—in getting it out of the lock I broke a piece off it—I told the Magistrate I tried the key and there was something so that it would not open it—the Magistrate sent me back to try it again and it then opened it perfectly easy—it would not open before because a key filed as this is if you do not put it far enough or too far it will not open—I had tried it two or three times and failed each time COURT Q What was the state of the key before it broke A There was a small nib on the key which is now broken off—I believe it is an altered key—I never attempted to open a Bramah lock before to my knowledge JOSEPH NELTHORPE re-examined The prisoner s business would not call him to the office at all but having been so long in the service we did not mined his being in the office and he used to come there for directions—he had no business there between seven and eight o clock but he might come thinking orders might have been left for him the night before—he bore so excellent a character we never minded his being there—his business was to cut off the water from persons who refused to pay the rate—the other money found on him had been paid him by those persons—I never paid him any money from the cash-box—I had nothing to do with it—he had been out all day with the Collector—when I charged him with robbery he said I am not a thief The prisoner received a good character GUILTY —Recommended to mercy — Transported for Seven Years Before Mr Sergeant Arabin

in the shop at that time—he generally stopped in the shop while the others went to dinner—I was in the parlour and had a view of the shop—in consequence of something which I saw the prisoner do I went to him and said he had been robbing me—he said he had not—I told him I saw him draw the till out take out some money and put it into his pocket—his hand was in his pocket a the time—I immediately told him to go to his brother to tell him to come up—he returned with his brother who opened his boxes with a key which the prisoner gave him and I saw these three silk handkerchiefs which are mine—I had had four of them nearly three years—I have the other in my pocket now—they had been in the window for sale but they were in the glass case when he took them—I had seen them there within a month—when they were found I told the prisoner they were mine—he said they were not—I immediately went for the one which belonged to them and produced it—I told him that was exactly the same pattern and they were mine—it matched in every way he said they were made a present to him by a female—in consequence of that observation and from what I afterwards heard I caused inquiry to be made of Ann Willis who is here Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Who was present when you searched the box A His brother—it was about two or three o clock in the aftertnoon—I gave him into custody about twelve o clock the same night—I never said the handkerchiefs were not my property—I swear that I never intimated they were not mine Q Why did you not give him into custody when you found them A I went during that time to Willis—I asked the prisoner where the female lived who gave him the handkerchiefs and I found Willis about eleven o clock—the prisoner gave me her name and address MR CLARKSON Q When you returned did you tell the prisoner what you had heard from Willis A I did not—I gave him into custody—I delayed doing so till I had seen Willis WILLIAM COLLENDER I am a constable I was sent for when the prisoner s boxes were searched—Mr Prew did not say the handkerchief were not his while I was there—it was very nearly twelve o clock when I went—two handkerchiefs were taken out of the box in my presence SARAH WHITE I am a laundress and live in Cannon-street-road The prisoner brought me three silk handkerchiefs to hem in the beginning of December I believe but I cannot exactly tell the date—they were separate when he brought them—he afterwards took them away and paid me for hemming them—he said they were not his—I asked him if I should bring them to him—I knew he lived at the prosecutor s as I washed for him—he said I need not bring them home as they were not bought at Mr Prew s he would call for them JOHN LLOYD I am an evening patrol On the evening of the 16th of December last I was bringing the prisoner from the compter to the mansion-house—I said nothing to induce him to say any thing—he owned to the fact that the handkerchiefs were in his trunk or box but he said if he was free his life time again if he was to go back again to his situation he would never be guilty of such a thing again as long as his breath was in his body Cross-examined Q Did you state your evidence to the attorney for the prosecution A I did not—I spoke to Collender the officer—I told him the same that I have stated here to-day—I was not before the Magistrate—I only took the prisoner there for Collender from the compter—I was at the Mansion-house but I did not hear the case—I did not tell what I have now ANN WILLIS I know the prisoner and his brother—on the evening of the 15th of December his brother came to me—I had given the prisoner three silk handkerchiefs—I could not swear to them—I neither marked nor hemmed them—I gave them to him just as I bought them out of the shop and could not swear to them— looking at the handkerchiefs I cannot say they are the same—I bought them somewhere in High-street Islington—I cannot exactly say where—I did not notice the name—it was on the right-hand side of the way—I bought them about six months ago and gave them to the prisoner the same day—I cannot say whether these are the handkerchiefs or not—I never said I had not given these handkerchiefs to him—that I swear COURT Q What was the colour of the handkerchiefs you gave the prisoner A They were something like these but I could not swear they are the same—they are the same colours and something of the same pattern—they may be the same I gave the prisoner but I cannot swear to them—I do believe them to be the same but I could not swear to them—the prisoner was out of a situation at the time—he was living with his brother over the water I believe but I do not know exactly—I met him in Pentonville-road promiscuously and gave him the handkerchiefs—that was a good bit from the shop where I bought them MR CLARKSON Q Did you know on the 16th of December that the prisoner was in custody A No I did not—I knew it when his brother told me—the handkerchiefs I gave him were all alike and all in one piece—I did not go before the Magistrate—I was not required to do so by the prisoner COURT Q What did you give for the handkerchiefs A 5s 6d a piece—I bought them of a man—I do not know that I had ever been in the shop before—I have not been there since that I know of—I bought the handkerchiefs to give the prisoner as a present—I did not make any appointment to meet him to give them to him—we met promiscuously—he was living at his brother s then I do not know where exactly—I do not think it was in my neighbourhood JURY Q When you say the shop was on the right hand side do you mean the side the church is on A On the right-hand side from Islington church going towards Pentonville-road MR CLARKSON Q Do you know the prisoner s attorney A Yes—I have not seen him on this subject WILLIAM TAYLOR called by desire of MR PHILLIPS I am the prisoner s brother I was present at the time the boxes were opened—my brother took the key and put it into the lock himself—I opened the box—when the handkerchiefs were found the prosecutor took them undoubled them and looked at them one after the other—he then laid them down and said I can t swear to them there are many handkerchiefs alike and of the same pattern and he laid them down saying Therefore I can t swear to them —I went to Ann Willis the same evening to make inquiry feeling uneasy that my brother should be accused of robbery MR CLARKSON Q Will you be so good as to tell us where you live and what you are A I live at No 1 White-street Bethnal-green-road and am an undertaker—I have not been there long—I have a shop there—I have lived with respectable butchers in Leadenhall-market ten years MR PHILLIPS called JANE TAYLOR The prisoner is my brother-in-law—I know Ann Willis—I remember the prisoner bringing three handkerchiefs to me saying they had been given to him by Ann Willis—that was either the latter end of June or the beginning of July—I know he has received many little trifling presents—he asked me to hem the handkerchiefs for him and I did hem them—I have no doubt at all that these are the handkerchiefs GUILTY Aged 24 — Transported for Seven Years Third Jury before Mr

have been in business—I have been in business since last Michaelmas—I was a harness-maker before and worked for Mr Tapps in Wigmore-street—I am not in the habit of buying any thing I can get—I called on Sir James to know if he had authorised the sale of these about a fortnight or three weeks ago—I knew he had been before the Magistrate but it is a general thing for gentlemen to give the harness to servants—it might stop with me two years—16s Is as much as they are worth to me—they are worth more—the two collars would not be worth that—the price of a new collar is 10s —it would not sell for more than 50s or 3l when I had completed it MR BALLANTINE Q Was any accusation made against you before you gave information A No GEORGE BERNARD I am a harness-maker At the latter end of October I accompanied Randall from Hanwell to Greenford to Sir James Leighton s stables—I was present at the purchase—both the prisoners were present—Randall asked if it was all right if they were authorized to sell it—one of them said it was all right enough—it was taken from a sort of empty stall place—they both assisted in taking it—Randall agreed to purchase it for 16s or 18s —Franklin drove us home in the cart with the harness and we all assisted in putting it in Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q What are you A A harnessmaker and live at No 14 Gray-street Manchester-square—I work at Mr Tapp s—I went to dine with my friend Randall—he had not told me before he went that he was going to buy harness—in my judgment 18s would have been dear for this WILLIAM GILLMAN I took the prisoners into custody

canvas value 5l and 200 yards of Hessen value 5l part of the same goods well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c —3rd COUNT for feloniously receiving them of some evil disposed person Messrs CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution MATTHEW PEAK police-constable G 189 On the 8th of August I was on duty in Bath-street City-road about one o clock in the afternoon—that is upwards of a mile from the West India Dock warehouse which is in Fen church-street—I saw a man of the name of Miller carrying a bag—I stopped him and asked what he had got there—he said It don t belong to me it belongs to that man ahead pointing to the prisoner Wagstaff—upon his saying that I called to Wagstaff and asked him what was in the bag—he said it was bags—I said Where did you get it from —he said From Hackney —that was the first answer he gave me—I asked who it belonged to—he said to himself—I asked Why you are going towards Hackney where are you going to take it to —he said That is my business —I told him he must come to the station-house and explain it there—I took him there and he then said he got it from Glover s Hall-court in Beech-lane where he lived—he gave no other account till he got before the Magistrate—I do not know whether what he said was taken down in writing—I do not think it was—he said something else there—I searched the bag and have its con tents here—this is part of it—here are forty-six pieces of canvas all three yards long—two have marks on them M 544—the others are plain—I took the prisoner Stokes on the 12th—I found him at the West India Dock warehouse Crutched-friars—he told me he lived at No 1 Smith-street Thomas-street—I went there and searched the house accompanied by Mr Williams of the Dock Company—I there found an axe a centre-bit stock two bags five pieces of canvas and a number of screws—these are them—I never saw a person of the name of Morris till I was at the office Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did Stokes tell you where his residence was A Yes and it was right—I found these things in a tin box in the kitchen—there were a lot of old nails in it—I went into the garden—there is no summer-house being built there—I went to another garden over some fields which was pointed out to me by his wife—there was a summer house there but it was quite complete—I understood that it was a garden occupied by the prisoner jointly with another person—this axe and the screws Mr Williams said belonged to the Dock Company Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q You say there are forty-six pieces of canvas A Yes cut into three yard lengths—this was about ten o clock—I did not say that Wagstaff stated that he was going to Hackney he said he got them from Hackney—I said You are going towards Hackney —I will swear that his answer was not that he was going to Hackney—I found him in Bath-street City-road nearly a mile from Hackney—I should have gone a shorter way to Hackney—Wagstaff came up to me at once when I beckoned to him and claimed the bag as his MR PAYNE Q Did you examine the seats in this summer-house A No It appeared to me to be quite complete from what judgment I have—I sat on the seats and thought they were fixed—I cannot say whe ther they had more than one leg MR BODKIN Q How far was Wagstaff ahead of you when you spoke to Miller A About twenty or thirty yards—I should have stuck to the property—he told me he had brought it from Hackney and I said You are going towards Hackney The Act of Parliament was here produced which incorporated the West India Dock Company and empowered them to sue and be sued under that title GEORGE MILLER I live in Cherry Tree-alley Golden-lane I am not a porter but being out of employment I took to it—on Tuesday the 8th of August about noon I was in Coleman-street—I saw Wagstaff there—he asked me if I wanted a job—I said Yes I should be glad of it —he said he would give me a shilling and a pot of beer to take a load for him—I said Very well where is it going to —he said You have got a good bit to go before you take it up —I asked him what I was to carry—he said That is no odds to you it does not weigh more than 1cwt 1qr you can carry that I suppose —I went to No 4 Glover s Hall-court Beech-lane—I don t know whether the house is let out in lodgings—I went into the two pair front room and saw a lot of papers all over blue besides the bag that I took—I can not say that I know the colour of indigo—it was a very dark blue colour—I took up the bag and helped him down with it into the street—when I got it upon my back I asked him where I was to go to—he said Do you know Hoxton —I said Yes very well —he said Do you know the Green Man —I said Yes very well indeed —he said That is where you have got to go to to take it as far as there —we started together—I went through Bath-street and Mr Peak stopped me about twenty yards up—upon his asking me whose it was I pointed out Wagstaff—we were taken to the station-house—this is the bag Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q You did not think it wonderful to get a job A I was very glad of it—there is none hardly to carry now—I was hired about a quarter-past twelve o clock RICHARD WILLIAMS I am a warehouse-keeper in the employ of the West India Dock Company—they have premises in Fenchurch-street—Stokes was in their employ and had been so a little exceeding two years—it was his duty to take charge of certain stores in the warehouse—30 029 1/2 yards of canvas had been placed under his care—it is an article prepare expressly for the Company s use of a particular weight and quality—I find on this piece of canvas a numerical number and the contractor s mark on it the letter M for Murray and a number as received on a particular day—these facts satisfy me that it is the property of the Company—I have no doubt of it—I cannot say what quantity has been lost—about two or three hundred yards must have been taken—a person in Stokes s situation must have missed so great a quantity if it had been taken by anybody else—he never made any representation of having missed any before he was taken from his employment—he would have ample opportunity of stealing that quantity if he chose—he had the care of those things—it was part of his duty to send out samples of indigo from the warehouse—they were sent out in bags—if any thing else went out in the bag nobody else would look over it—it would go out on his own responsibility—on the 8th of August I saw Stokes send out some indigo—these tools are the property of the Company—they were in Stokes s care—it was his duty to keep them in a store-room—they were to be locked up—he had no authority to take them off the premises COURT Q Did Wagstaff work on the premises A I never saw him—he had nothing to do with the Docks to my knowledge—I never saw him there MR BODKIN Q Do you know Ridler A Yes I have seen him on the West India Dock Company s premises with Stokes—I found marks of indigo on the generality of the canvas bags—they would not be cut to these lengths for any purpose on the Company s premises—they are each about three yards long—these papers which were found in Wagstaff s lodging have contained samples of indigo—I am positive they have been on the Company s premises—each paper has contained two-pound samples of indigo—the samples sent out by Stokes on the 8th of August were contained in papers of this kind—I cannot say that they were sent out on that day but they have been on the premises Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q This must have been taken from within the Docks A From the warehouse in Fenchurch-street—that is one of the general warehouses of the West India Dock Company—if these things had not been lost or found or stolen they ought to have been in the warehouse—nothing properly or honestly leaves the ware house in these small pieces—if I found a piece of canvas of this description I should not recognise it as being the property of the Company except from the mark—the Company sever the pieces they have to different lengths but never to three yards—we have what is called Bolts of canvas containing about seventy-two yards each—the smallest piece that the Company cut is about three feet six inches—they cut off larger pieces as high as seven feet five inches and three feet three quarters but never three yards exactly—whoever stole this piece must have taken it off the premises Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When were you first examined before the Magistrate A On the 11th of August and on the 18th of August MR PRICE Q Do you know Mr John Morris A Yes—I do not know how to describe him—I know nothing about him from my own personal knowledge—I saw him last in May—he was introduced to me by Mr Tyrrell with reference to information that Morris had given him not being found to be applicable to the East India Dock Company but presumed to be applicable to the West India Dock Company—then I had an interview with him—and it was found to be our man Stokes—Mr Morris was introduced to me by Mr Tyrrell as being capable of affording information of the Company having been robbed—he offered some information as to the description of the prisoner Stokes and his daily avocation—what I heard I communicated to Mr Longlands the secretary MR PAYNE Q Was the 25th of August the first time that any evidence was given about finding the centre-bit and the other things A Certainly not—that was the final commitment—I gave my evidence of finding the things on the 12th—I did not sign any paper on the 12th—on the 18th I signed my first deposition and a week after that I signed another deposition containing an account of finding the things at Stokes s house—on the 12th Stokes was taken and taken before the Magistrate and on the same day his house was searched and the centre-bit stock and bags found and brought to the office—I signed a deposition on the 18th and another on the 25th but it was mentioned on the first examination—there is a thoroughfare through the warehouse-yard on sufferance—we have a right to stop people but do not—from twenty to two hundred persons are employed by the Company—I am general superintendent—the bags for packing are given out by Stokes to the maker—when the samples of indigo are not returned we see no more of the papers—but these had been returned—there is the mark of the sale lot on them—the indigo was sold in October last and the papers remain till there is a sufficient quantity to sell them—but they never have been sold yet—after the bags quitted the prisoner s possession and before they left the warehouse I should say things could not have got into them that ought not—he having obtained a pass for them to go out the gate-keeper puts his hand to them—he does not inspect them—Stokes is not there every day from morning to night—he was sent on messages formerly but not lately—other people send out goods when he is not there—there were 30 029 yards of canvas and Stokes never complained of his having lost two or three hundred yards—it could not have been taken without being missed by him—he has the general appropriation of this cloth—they remain in bolts till they are converted to different lengths by the prisoner—we have not been in the habit of taking stock—I understand that Stokes was in the employ of the East India Company before he came to us and that he had a pension from them—I do not know how long he was there—I know two Mr Johnsons—I do not know which of them is in the Private Trade Office of the East India Company MR BODKIN Q You have been asked whether there is a thorough fare through these premises is it through a gateway A Yes that does not enable people to go through the warehouse—when a number of these sample-bags of indigo are to be sent out they are put into a sack—it was Stokes s duty to do that and it was his duty to go with it till it was off the premises—the watchman at the gate makes no examination—that would detect cloth at the bottom of the sack—it is a mere casual examination—confidence was placed in Stokes—200 or 300 yards is the quantity we have found—how many more have been stolen I cannot tell—from May to August communications were made to me with respect to the robberies going on at the warehouse Stokes was allowed to remain in his situation undisturbed till August—about the 19th or the 20th of May the Company declined having any thing to do with Morris ELIZABETH ELLEN LOWE I am the wife of Joseph Reed Lowe a working optician and live in Glover s-hall-court Beech-lane I knew Wagstaff—he lived in the up-stairs room of our house—on Tuesday the 8th of August I saw him in company with the prisoner Hallen at my door—they went away together—shortly after that Wagstaff returned with a bag—there was something in it—it was such a bag as this—it appeared bulky—he took it up stairs—Wagstaff went out directly without the bag—he soon after returned in company with another man a stranger to me—Wagstaff and the stranger went up stairs together—I afterwards saw them in the passage with the bag—I should not know the man again that was with him Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q You saw Hallen and him together A Yes that was first—then they went out and Wagstaff returned with the bag—it was not ten minutes after Wagstaff went out that he re turned with the porter—he returned about a quarter past twelve o clock with the bag and in a few minutes he brought the porter and went off THOMAS COOPER I am a watchman in the employ of the West India Dock Company I was there on the 11th of May—my attention was directed to a man of the name of Ridler by John Williams—I watched Ridler and followed him when he left the dock into the Minories—I then saw him with the prisoner Hallen—they went to a public-house and then to an oil shop—I did not see them after—I don t know Stokes—I am watchman at the West India Docks MR PAYNE called JOHN TREBLE I live at the bottom of Carter-street Walworth-road Stokes is building a summer-house—I was lending him a hand—I saw these tools there—the summer-house is not finished yet—I have known him ten years and always understood him to bear an honest character John Davis Cox a publican of Thomas-street Kennington-common and Richard Jones of the Feathers in Wild-street gave the prisoner Stokes a good character THOMAS STOKES— GUILTY —Aged 33 WILLIAM WAGSTAFF— GUILTY —Aged 29 Transported for Seven Years JAMES HALLEN— NOT GUILTY Sixth Jury before Mr Sergeant Arabin 
t18370918-2142  2142 THOMAS STOKES was indicted for stealing on the 19th of August 200 yards of canvas value 5l and 200 yards of Hessen value 5l the goods of the West India Dock Company his masters and JAMES HALLEN alias HALLEM alias SMITH for feloniously receiving the said goods well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c —3rd COUNT for receiving them of an evil-disposed person MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution RICHARD WILLIAMS I am warehouseman in the employ of the West India Dock Company They have a warehouse in Fenchurch-street—I am stationed there—the prisoner Stokes was one of the workmen and has been so about two years—there was a considerable quantity of canvas in the ware house where he was which was under his especial care—it was given out by him and the receipts recorded by him—I have found between two and three hundred yards of that canvas which is a quantity that could not have been taken without his missing it—he never made any complaint or representation of missing any up to the time of his being taken into custody—I have seen a man of the name of Ridler at the warehouse in Fenchurch street speaking with Stokes—that was after the Company had received through a person of the name of Morris some intimation of some of their property being stolen by some of their servants—I desired one of our people named Cooper to follow Ridler when he went away—it was Stokes s duty to send out from the warehouse bags containing samples of indigo and to accompany them as far as the outer gate where the gate-keeper was stationed—that would give him an opportunity if he were disposed of putting canvas or any thing else into the bags containing the indigo—the gate-keeper would put his hand on them but not examine them narrowly—that would not enable him to detect canvas in the bag—on the 18th of August Stokes sent out some indigo in the way I have mentioned—I should say this is a part of the canvas under Stokes s care— looking at it —it corresponds with cloth we have on the premises made specially for our use—there is no mark on it but I should say it is the property of the West India Dock Company—I should say it has not been made up thus for the honest purposes of the Company—this bag which was found on Wagstaff is also the Property of the Company—some of their canvas bags which were found on Wagstaff have the appearance of having rubbed against indigo — See page 662 Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How long had Stokes been in the employment of the Company A Two years or a little better from June two years—I don t speak to any particular marks on that found at Hallem s house—I speak to it from its general appearance and from comparison with the other cloth—there have been from twenty to two hundred persons in the employ of the West India Dock Company—this canvas was in a room set specially apart for the stores—the doors of the warehouse are open during the hours of business—there are two doors to that in Stokes s department one is open during the hours of business—Stokes has been employed in taking samples of indigo which would take him off the premises—other people would have access to these rooms in his absence—they would go there to draw stores but in his absence another man would be left there in charge—there is a carriage way through the yard used by the public—I cannot say what quantity of the canvas we had at one time—the whole quantity that was manufactured for the Company was 30 000 yards but it was not all delivered at once MR BODKIN Q Supposing any persons to have stolen these articles would Stokes have known it A Yes he would have known if a triffing article had been taken away COURT Q Why must Stokes have missed it A Because it was done up in bolts of seventy seventy-one or seventy-two yards and therefore he must have missed it—the arrangement of the rolls round the room is such that he must—they begin at one part and go on regularly through it—Stokes kept an account of all that came in not of that that went out—he never made any statement of any being lost ALEXANDER PATTISON I am in the employ of Mr John Murray of No 46 Church-street Minories a canvas merchant My master is in the habit of manufacturing canvas for the West India Dock Company—it was of a peculiar description for their purposes— examining the property —we manufactured 30 000 and odd yards of this sort for the Company—the date of the contract was 1st March and it was all delivered by July—I should say this is a part of it—it is the same width and weight—I do not think this a piece of that found at Hallem s is a part it Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Have you any particular means of speaking to this except the general appearance of it A From the width and weight—there are the marks of our house on it—we make for other people as well as the West India Dock Company but this was marked and numbered expressly for that Company and these are their marks on some of them—there are not on this piece a piece found at Hallem s house MR CLARKSON Q In your judgment is it the same A Yes MARMADUKE LOVELL police-constable G 144 On Wednesday the 16th of August I apprehended the prisoner Hallem—I met him in Old street and took him—I was in plain clothes—I said Your name is Hallem ain t it —he said No —I said Yes it is don t deny your name —I said I am an officer and I want you for a robbery committed at the West India Dock Company s warehouse —he said I don t know any thing about it — Well I said I will take you for Hallem and you must go to the station-house —I said What is the use of your denying your name it will make it all the worse for you —he said a person being pounced upon as he was might say twenty things—he said I can soon correct my error my name is Hallem —I took him to the station house—nothing else passed—I afterwards proceeded to his house—I had been three or four days watching his house which is No 71 Phillip-street Commercial-road thinking he would come home—I never saw him come home—I went to the house and searched it the same evening—I there found some of these articles in a cupboard on the second floor and these bags down below in a shed under the stairs and these other pieces of canvas in the second-floor back room—they are what the witnesses have spoken of Hallem Q Where was I when you said you wanted me for a robbery Witness In Old-street—I told him it was for a robbery when I took him into custody ELIZABETH ELLEN LOWE I am the wife of Joshua Reed Lowe a working optician living in Glover s-hall-court Beech-lane A man of the name of Wagstaff lodged in the same house in the second-pair front room—I do not know whether he was acquainted with the prisoner Hallem—I saw them together on the 8th of August between ten and eleven o clock at my place—they went away together—Hallem came in the morning first at a quarter before eight o clock and my husband answered him—Wagstaff was not up—I saw him going away from my door with Wagstaff between ten and eleven o clock—Wagstaff returned about a quarter past twelve o clock—he brought a bag on his shoulder—it was shown to me yesterday—it was such a one as this and bulky—he went up stairs with it came down again and went out he returned shortly after with a porter and carried it away—this was on the 8th GEORGE MILLER I am a porter I was employed by Wagstaff on the 8th of August to carry a bag from No 4 Glover s-hall-court Beech lane—I carried it in the direction I was told and was stopped by an officer—the officer took the bag and took Wagstaff into custody—the bag continued in custody—this is the bag—it was taken by Peak the officer—I met Hallem the next morning—I had never seen him till the day before—he was quite a stranger to me—I was in Whitecross-street—he said Was not you the man that carried that load yesterday —I said Yes —he said How has he got on —I do not think he mentioned the man s name—I said I got discharged he was remanded till Friday —he said It is all right he will get off on Friday —nothing more passed—I never saw him again Hallem Q Did you ever state this before A No—I was not asked before the magistrate Hallem It is false—you were asked and said you never saw me before MR BODKIN Q Were you ever asked if you saw Hallem No not till this morning THOMAS COOPER I am a watchman at the West India Dock I remember being directed to watch a man there—I know Ridler—I did not see him come to the docks but he was pointed out to me by Mr Williams and I followed him from Fenchurch-street just by the warehouse a very little way from the gate to the Minories—when I got to the Minories I saw Hallem and they went into a gin-shop together and then they came out and went into an oil shop together where they sell mats and other things—Ridler came out in about twenty minutes—then they separated MATTHEW PEAK police-constable G 198 I was on duty on the 8th of August in Bath-street City-road I saw the porter carrying a bag—I stopped and asked him questions—I took the bag and took a man named Wagstaff into custody—he was about twenty or thirty yards from the man who was carrying the bag—that was the man who was tried here yesterday —I attended before the magistrates—Wagstaff and Hallem and Stokes were jointly charged before the magistrates WILLIAM BRAND I am a deputy marshal of London On Saturday the 19th of August I took a man of the name of Ridler—I searched his lodgings the same day and found thirty pieces of canvas small and large these are five of them ALEXANDER PATTISON re-examined These five pieces I believe form part of the canvas that was manufactured for the West India Dock Company—here is part of the seventeenth piece of it among them RICHARD WILLIAMS Cross-examined by MR PRICE Q Are you acquaint ed with Mr Morris A He first introduced himself to me in May—Mr Tyrrell introduced the name not the man—Morris stated that he could afford me information of a robbery being carried on at the West India Docks warehouse by a man of the name of Stokes—Morris did not engage me to employ a person to purchase stolen commodities belonging to the Company for the purpose of detecting the thief—I never made any offer of a bonus to Morris at any time for doing any thing towards a discovery of any robbery on the Company nor did any body in my presence to my re collection—I had an interview with Mr Tyrrell—he informed me that information had been communicated that the East India Dock Company had been robbed by one of their servants which did not apply to them but as we had a man of that name it must apply to us—I am not able to say whether Morris was employed by some official gentlemen to use what means he thought proper for detecting robberies on the Company—he had an interview with me and I took him to Mr Longlands the secretary to afford the information Q Did you tell Morris at any time that any servant in the employ of the Company who was suspected should have the opportunity of robbing the Company for the purpose of detection A That he should not be interfered with Q Was that for the purpose of affording Mr Morris greater facility in using his measures for the detection of robbery A I know nothing of that—it was Mr Morris s observation that he might not be interfered with—I did not propose at any time to absent myself for the purpose of affording facilities on the contrary I was more about the warehouse and the yard—I had not suspicion of any of the servants at that time—I had no suspicion after the communication made by Morris and have not at this moment—the Company have been robbed but the prisoner is no longer their servant—I have had this suspicion since I saw Morris—in con sequence of seeing him I entertained these suspicions slightly but they were shaken very shortly after having seen Morris—I did not believe it—I believe it now—Mr Dixon is the inspector of our Company s police—I have seen Morris in his company—he was not called in to a conference between me and Morris—Mr Dixon is here—I did not give Mr Dixon instructions to look out after any of the servants of the Company—by virtue of his office he took what measures he thought fit—he had no instructions from me—he directed me that a man would be sent up to watch the premises—I had nothing to do with it—I was desired to allow him to proceed as he thought proper under Mr Dixon s direction—I afforded him the facility of residence on the premises for their placing themselves on the premises—I mean Cooper and Mr Dixon—I know nothing of Morris being employed—he was to be referred to Mr Dixon—I do not know of my own knowledge that any sum of money was offered Morris—Mr Forrester was not employed to my knowledge—I do not know the man—Morris asked that he should not be interfered with—we were from May till August before we discovered any delinquency in the servants—we abandoned all idea of detecting them after May—we discovered that depredations had been committed on the 11th of August and our suspicions had been attempted to be excited in May but they were not confirmed in August—when I was told of it in May I did not believe it—after the detection in August I began to think there was something in it—that proved there was some ground for my suspicions and that I was mistaken in May MR CLARKSON Q You say that you first saw Morris after having heard him spoken of by Mr Tyrrell did he stipulate that he should be paid money by the Company on the apprehension of the party and more on the conviction A He stated that he had been promised a sum of money—that he had had some engagement with Mr Tyrrell to be remunerated for the information—I took him up to Mr Longlands and he referred him to Mr Dixon the principal of the police—Morris was under an engagement to furnish the West India Dock Company with information till the 19th or 20th of May when they declined to have any more to do with him—he came to me to state why he had not detected the party and said that the man should be forced to commit the robbery if I would be a consenting party—he said the party should see Stokes and tell him if he did not make the supply of cloth that was required that the man should come down and make the disclosure to me—I told him there was a probability that the man had seen his error but I would never be a party to force a man to commit a crime it should be on his own head and he should take all the responsibility but I could not lay my head on my pillow if I did—I do not know that Morris has been repeatedly charged with thefts—I did not know that at that time he had been charged with burglary or I would not have admitted him into my presence—he came to me as a person who could give information—I did not know that he had received 200l or 300l from the Custom-house—I know he had presented himself to Mr Tyrrel under the name and pretence of an attorney—I was not present at any thing that Morris said about the receivers—I did not know that he had made a stipulation that his men the receivers should be protected—I received Morris and acted under the direction of my superior under a belief that he was able to detect a robbery on the Company by some of their men and I referred him to Mr Longlands the secretary and then to Mr Dixon—the discovery of the robbery on the 8th of August was totally unconnected with Morris and unknown to him MR PRICE called JOHN MORRIS I am an artist s colour-man and live in Angel-court Throgmorton-street I know the prisoner Hallen—I know Mr Tyrrell the East India Dock Company s solicitor—I was introduced to him on the subject of the prisoner Hallen—I cannot say when—it is a good many months back—I gave Mr Tyrrell to understand that I had an intimation given me that the Dock Company had been robbed—he asked me to pro duce some of the articles—I produced some pieces of canvas—he said he should like to see a bolt and some time afterwards I produced a bolt to him and after a great deal of inquiry he said he believed this person was not in their employ but the West India Dock Company s and he gave me a note to Mr Williams—I saw him on the subject and Mr Williams desired me to see Mr Dixon and said I had better go on the coach to Blackwall—I said I had some business to attend to but I went down soon after and saw Mr Dixon and there was an agreement—Mr Williams and Mr Dixon said that my men whom I employed in the affair should not be hurt—I told them I did not know this myself that I had it from another per son who produced to me some portions of canvas and I produced them to Mr Tyrrell and Mr Williams—I had employed Hallem for the purpose of obtaining that canvas—Mr Tyrrell gave me two sovereigns for the purpose of getting it and I left a bolt of canvas at his office—Hallem was employed by me to purchase canvas of this description of the Company s servants for the purpose of detection MR CLARKSON Q Which of the servants A I believe the man s name was Stokes—I have been an artist s colourman I suppose eighteen months or two years—I have lived at No 16 Angel-court four or five months—I have the lease of the house—I have likewise a manufactory in Moorfields where I keep several men at work—I get my living as a tradesman—I got a bolt of canvas from Hallen—I cannot tell on what day but I produced it as soon as I got it to Mr Tyrrell—I have been in custody but the Magistrate would not hear the case Q Have you ever been in custody for felony A I do not under stand what you mean by felony—I have never been in custody for picking pockets—I have never been in custody for burglary—I know Lee the officer—I have never been locked up an hour—there was a man taken up who was walking with me but the Magistrate would not hear any thing against me—I may have had a glass of grog too much and have been fined—I never was locked up—I never was detained an hour for felony—if I have been in custody half a dozen times it has only been as I have stated in an evening—I do not know that I have been in custody half a dozen times—I would not swear that I have—I have not acted as an attorney in the course of this prosecution—I was not taken to Mr Price—it was done through the channel that introduced me to Mr Timothy Tyrrell—I do not think the gentleman would like to be named—it was Mr Hobler Q Was it arranged between you and Mr Hobler that you should go and instruct Mr Price A One of Mr Hobler s clerks—if you can prove that I was in custody before that it is more than I can recollect—I never was in custody for felony—I was taken in custody to Lambeth-street and charged with felony by a policeman for being along with a man and the Magistrate would not hear any thing against me—I cannot tell when that was—it was six or seven years ago—I have never been locked up an hour since then—I do not recollect it—I say that I have not upon my recollection—there is a great deal of prejudice between me and Lee Q Did you not get 400l for affecting to give information on the subject of the Custom-house robbery and then you did not give a word of it A That has nothing to do with it—the government were well satisfied with what I did and paid me very handsomely—Mr Hobler paid me I do not say what—Mr Williams urged me to urge Hallem to urge Stokes to commit a felony—I might have said that Hallem was the man to manage these things and would always come it it me—I do not recollect saying that there was no fear of his being taken into custody as he was too downey a cove to be caught with any property in his possession—I have applied to be let into Newgate to confer with Hallem—I have known Hallem eight or nine years but I do not think he was acquainted with me—I knew a person of the name Jordan the thief who was transported for robbing the Custom-house and Sullivan—I do not know what you mean by his being a friend of mine—I have been in his company and in Lords company and members of parliament—I have known Hallem some years—I never knew any dishonest action of him—I do not recollect saying there was hardly a good old thief left in London and if Hallem was convicted my work would be stopped—I do not like to swear anything that is wrong MR TYRRELL examined by MR PRICE I am solicitor to the East India Dock Company—I introduced Morris to the West India Dock Company for the purpose of detecting some robbery—I did not know Hallem s name but Morris called and said the person had got into difficulty and as I had introduced him to Mr Williams he hoped I should interfere—this was a very short time ago MR PAYNE Q Was the prisoner Stokes in the employ of the East India Dock Company A No MR BODKIN Q Is there a person of the name of Stokes in the East India Dock Company A There is—the first introduction of Morris to me was on the 19th of April—he was to have money—he produced to me a piece of canvas which he represented as part of the pillage and upon that I transferred him over to the other Company MR CLARKSON to MR WILLIAMS Q Did you ever tell Morris to urge Hallem on that Stokes might commit a robbery A Decidedly not—nothing of the sort HALLEM— GUILTY Aged 34 — Transported for Fourteen Years STOKES— GUILTY Aged 33 — See Page

master MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution THOMAS HEIGHAM I missed money from the time the prisoner came to Mr Thomas Machin s employ till the 6th of February—on that day I searched his box and found some money—the next morning I found some more amounting to 8l 15s and I gave the prisoner into custody—I discovered a dressing-case in the house on the evening of the day the prisoner was committed for trial which was the 7th of February—that was after he was committed—when he was apprehended on the charge of the half-crown he did not say one word about his having any gold money in the house—the dressing-case is here— producing it —his wages were 22l a year payable quarterly and his board and lodging—I found this dressing-case in his room and found two secret springs which lift up a false bottom and there are four compartments below—I found eight half-sovereigns in one paper in one compartment—they were in writing-paper which is commonly used behind the butter-counter—in the other compartment I found sixteen half-sovereigns and two sovereigns wrapped in another paper of nearly the same description—Mr Warden took them out—we examined the gold money and two pieces in particular were very greasy and likewise cheesey—the substance of the butter would not have remained on the half-sovereigns had they not been cheesey Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q I take it for granted you have taken good care to preserve the sovereigns in the state in which they were found A Mr Warden has them—he took the papers and the money—I found the dressing-case about ten o clock in the evening of the 7th in the prisoner s bedroom—it was locked—Mr Warden took the key from him at the station-house before eleven o clock in the morning—he had the key the whole day and I had the opportunity the whole day of going into his bed-room but I did not have the key till ten o clock in the evening MR CLARKSON Q Were you aware that the prisoner had any box that contained a secret place of this description when you were before the Magistrate A I was not—the prisoner did not say he had any gold money about him when the keys were taken from him at the station-house—he asked for some money before the Magistrate—I do not remember that he asked for any particular amount CHARLES STEWART WARDEN I was present with Mr Heigham on finding the gold money under the secret spring of this dressing-case—it consisted of two parcels—two half-sovereigns were very greasy and greased my fingers—they were covered with a kind of dirt—whether it was cheese or not I cannot tell—it was in paper—I have got part of the money—here is the paper in which I found eight half-sovereigns— producing it —here is the other paper—I have had it a great deal in my pocket having had occasion to show it to the Magistrate and that would have the effect of rubbing part of the grease off—before the prisoner was committed for trial on the charge of the half-crown he requested to have some of the money which was found in his box—that was the silver money—on that occasion he did not say one word about having any gold or any sovereigns or half-sovereigns in a dressing-case under a secret spring—some of the silver money was given to him Cross-examined Q How much A 1l 7s and 3s 6d which I took from his pocket in going—I have part of the money—the rest by direction of the Magistrate I delivered up to a clerk of Messrs Harmer and Flower on receiving a receipt—they are the prisoner s attorneys I believe—I told the Magistrate of my finding this gold money and by his order I gave 5l of this gold to the prisoner s attorney—I took the box to the Magistrate on the first meeting after the commitment of the prisoner—he was not taken before the Magistrate that he might be examined about this gold—he was in prison—I did not go to the prison to him—I do not know of the prisoner or his solicitor having any notice of this charge WILLIAM SHEPHERD I am clerk to Mr Humphrey the attorney for this case—I served a notice of this trial on the prisoner personally at the gaol on the 26th of February WILLIAM SHEEN I have been in Mr Machines service three years next July—on the solemn oath I have taken I have never taken one shilling or the fraction of a shilling from my master during that time—the prisoner came to my master on the 11th of November last—I had no reason to know that he was in want of money—on the 21st of January he said when his grandmother died that he should have money but not before then—on the same evening he came home intoxicated and as he was pulling off to trowsers he said I must mind my two sovereigns that I have borrowed of my cousin —I remember a few days after the 21st of January I really cannot say when the postman brought a letter—he said his brother had died—he said his brother was a compositor in the Queen s printing-office and he told me that whilst composing a verse in the Psalms his brother died—he did not say any thing about mourning that evening but during the week he said he must be measured for some mourning clothes—he said that his cousin was answerable for the clothes and he was to pay one sovereign per quarter till the debt was paid—on the 4th of February the Sunday before he was taken into custody as we were going along to Woolwich he said that next Sunday his wages became due being the 11th of February and that would set him up when they came Cross-examined Q When did you mention all this conversation first A Mr Heigham asked me several questions when the prisoner was taken into custody—I was very sorry for it—I mentioned it the following week after he was taken into custody—I will not swear precisely to a week but it was from a week to a fortnight after—the conversation all came quite familiar to me after he was in custody—I remembered every word I have said—I cannot call to recollection any thing else—nobody was present when he said any of these things to me—I did not tell of it till I was asked—I was not examined before the Magistrate—I did not know that the prisoner was taken till Mr Heigham was going out—he was taken on Wednesday morning in my master s house—I did not know he was taken till Mr Heigham came home and said he had been before a Magistrate—that was after the prisoner was committed—I did not tell Mr Heigham of this then—I did not know that the gold was found till Mr Warden came down—I cannot say when that was—Mr Heigham first told me it was found during the week after the prisoner was committed—when Mr Heigham told me the money was found and said he could not be short of money—I said No he could not if that was the case —I told my master of this conversation the same week after the prisoner was taken—I cannot recollect how soon after—I will not swear I told him within five days—I did not tell Mr Heigham because it did not come to my recollection till such time as I was in conversation with Mr Heigham—I told him the conversation on the Woolwich road—I believe Mr Warden was present but I cannot wear to that event MR PHILLIPS on the prisoner s behalf called GEORGE JACQUES I am a fancy-cabinet and morocco-case maker and live in Domingo-street Old-street-road I am cousin to the prisoner—his grandmother died in July last—she lived at a place called Bosham by Chichester—the prisoner had mourning for his wife s father—I remember going down to Chichester to receive money from Messrs Price and Strickland s by the side of the cathedral—the prisoner received 54l 13s pn the death of his first wife—that was at the latter end of August 1837 MR CLARKSON Q Are you a housekeeper A I am—I occupy the whole house and keep several men under me—I never lent the prisoner two half-sovereigns—I never had any occasion to do it—I had money in any possession belonging to him from the time he received the money in August—he received the money into his hand and gave me 30l to take care of and he had the rest—I left 24l with him—what I had was in notes on the Chichester Bank—I had given him back the 30l within 3l up to his being taken—the last I paid him was at my house a fortnight before he was taken up—he called there occasionally—in August last he was not in very bad circumstances—he was in middling circumstances—he was at work for me as a French-polisher—at that time he lived in Macclesfield-street—I had been at his house—he was landlord of the house—I know No 3 Waterloo-place and have known it for years—the prisoner lived there—I cannot tell how long—I should think it might be two months—I was there once only while he worked for me—I cannot tell the month—it was about November I should think—I believe be was living there on the 11th of November—he has a wife—I only went there once—I was going to a dance that was to take place close by and I went to know where it was to take place—I am not a man of property—I serve the principal houses in the City—my house is private—it is wholesale—I have no shop—I have a warehouse in the back part of the house—it is

was in custody—I did not hear at all that I was to be a witness here—I came up voluntarily to do him any service in my power—I went and engaged the attorney a fortnight ago—I knew all these circumstances about receiving this money—I did not expect to state them—when I went to Mr Heigham I did not tell him that the prisoner had been out of a situation for two months before he got Mr Machin s because he was in my employ—he was out of his own line—I have no knowledge of telling Mr Machin or saying in his hearing that the prisoner had been out of a situation two months before he went there—I am so positive of it that I will swear I did not—I did not say a word about his being in my service for two months before—I said I did not know much about him he worked for me and was paid his wages the same as other men—sometimes a guinea sometimes 25s a week—it was piece-work— according to what he earned—I believe I told Mr Heigham that the prisoner had several times had money from me in small sums—I also told him that the prisoner had had some relations die for whom he had a suit of black but I did not know who it was—I do not know exactly what did say—I do not know what I told him—I will not swear that I did not say it was his wife s brother had died and that he was in some attorney s officer—I declare to my God that I never said that I had lent him a sum of 16l to buy mourning for that very brother nor words to that effect—nothing of the sort—I did not add in Mr Heigham s hearing that the prisoner was to pay me off by 1l a month—I said I had money of the prisoner s in my hand and was paying for his clothes in that way—I never said I had lent him 16l and that he was to pay me the sum of 1l a month or a quarter MR PHILLIPS Q Was any thing at all said about that A I cannot exactly say what was said—the shop was full of customers—they were all talking at once—Mr Machin was in the shop—I went across to speak to him—about a fortnight ago I went to Messrs Harmer s office to engage them for my brother—I told them about the sum my brother had received at Chichester COURT Q What money did you pay to Messrs Harmer A Two pounds MR CLARK SON Q I think you said the

Jacques A I saw him at my master s house after the prisoner was in custody—he told me the prisoner had had a wife but she had been dead five or six years—he told me that the prisoner had been out of a

times to the amount of 16l —he told me that some relation of the prisoner s had died he did not know whom and that the prisoner had had a suit of black for him—that he believed it was his brother or

Swans inn in Bishopsgate-street The prisoner Starkie came into my service on the 11th of February last and remained till the 17th of March—inconsequence of something which happened on the morning of that day I desired her to tell me who her friends were in town—she referred me to some at the West end of the town but I found none of them—I returned home at night and in consequence of inquiries I made I told her to leave the house—I had not seen Sarah Bel at my house that day—I had seen her there before I believe—she came from the dirty linen and brought a basket with her—when Starkie left my house that night I followed her to No 2 Blacksmith s Arms-place kept by Mr Flyn—I made inquiries there and found a man named John Bell at is 2 Lower Chapman-street—I set a person to watch—on the 22nd

and met two policemen—Nicholas followed him to St Katharine s Dock and brought him with the truck and boxes to the station-house—the boxes were opened there in the presence of the prisoners who had been takes there and were found to contain property belonging to me which is here—I never saw John Bell before that day—I have no reason to belive he was in the habit of coming to my house—this is my property— looking at it —it was all under my care at my house MARY ANN BOUCHER I am bar-maid to the prosecutor While Starkie lived there I have seen Sarah Bell come there several times for the linen—she sometimes brought a basket—I never saw John Bell to my knowledge nor any man with her—this property was missed from time to time while Starkie was living there—on the evening of the 17th of March the same evening as Starkie left Sarah Bell came—I believe she had a basket with her—I believe Starkie was at home at the time—she said she was told by the other servant that Starkie was not at home and she would wait for the empty basket and while they were gone to empty it she went away with out saying any thing at all—I never saw her at the house since JOHN NICHOLAS I am a policeman I was called on by Mr Starkey on the 22nd of March and took John Bell into custody at St Katharine s Dock and took him the truck and boxes to the station-house—I afterwards went with the prosecutor to No 5 Anthony-street and there saw Mrs Chason—I inquired if a young woman was stopping there—she denied it however I searched the house and in the privy of the next house I found the prisoner Starkie—I told her I wanted her for a robbery—she said nothing to that—Sarah Bell was brought there by another officer and we took her Starkie and Chason to the station-house—boxes were opened there in the presence of them all and this property which has been produced was found in them—I asked Starkie if she had he keys—she said they were not locked—I found them corded and nailed but not locked—I did not ask whose boxes they were and neither of them said anything about them JOSIAH CHAPLIN I am a policeman I took Sarah Bell into custody at No 2 Lower Chapman-street on the 22nd of March—I asked her if the

child about three months old—I said she might take it with her—it was a bed in a back-room and she went and fetched it Elizabeth Starkie It was my child Witness Bell took the Child with her to the other prisoner who is its mother WILLIAM SAWYER I am a police-sergeant I was at the station-house on the 22nd of March when the prisoners were brought there and saw the different articles taken out of the boxes—some of the linen was marked J B —the prisoner Starkie said to John Bell Those articles marked J B are your property and those marked J S are the property of my husband you know that if you like to speak the truth —on which John Bell said Oh you d——d soft one if I am asked the question I will well the troth in what way the things came to my house and who they belong to you have no right to bring more people into it than are guilty —she made no reply Starkie I never mentioned such a thing and never heard John Bell say it ELISABETH CHASON I live at No 5 Anthony-street and carry on he mangling business I know both the prisoners—Sarah Bell lives at No 2 Lower Chapman-street—on the 18th of March Starkie came to me and asked me to provide her with a lodging as her husband she said had

Thursday the 22nd of March John Bell came to my house with a truck—Starkie was at my house at the time—the boxes were put on the truck and taken away—the officer afterwards came and I denied her—she did not tell me to do so particularly—I did it of myself because she had deceived me—I was taken into custody myself and afterwards liberated JAMES LEA I am an officer I searched the house No 2 Lower Chapman-street where John Bell lives the day after his apprehension—I found these three keys two of which open the two boxes—I received fourteen duplicates from Jane Gill four of which are for property pledged belonging to the prosecutor—I also found other keys which open a drawer in the prosecutor s house where the property was taken from and among them were skeleton-keys—they were hanging

been in the habit of pledging at our shop for four or five months—these two table-cloths was pledged by a woman named Bell—I have two duplicates corresponding with those found in the oven—I cannot swear that she is the woman that pawned them—Lea gave me information of the robbery—I sent to the station-house to say that such property was pledged in the name of Bell and produced them at Lambeth-street on Monday last RICHARD GRIFFITHS I am assistant to my father who is a pawnbroker in Commercial-road I know Sarah Bell by sight—a shirt and two pairs of stockings were pledged with us

before convicted of felony and JOHN CARR for feloniously receiving the same well knowing it to have been stolen against the Statute &c MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution PATRICK FITZGIBBON I am in the employ of Seth Smith a builder who is building near Grosven or Terrace Harton-street and Eaton-square I am employed under Woodneld the foreman of the plumbers—on the morning of the 15th of March I cut some lead for gutters by Woodfield s directions—I left a piece of lead remaining on the premises which the foreman said was a waste piece—he told me to roll it up—it was from forty to fifty lbs weight—the premises are in the Mews between Chester-square and Eaton-square not far from some buildings in Wilton-cretcent on the right band corner of Belgrave-square—you can go down Belgrave-square from where the lead was to the building I have named but there are several ways to go one as near as another—you can go through Chapel-street from the buildings in Chester-square to the buildings in Belgrave-square—it is a bye way—the straight way would be down the square—I know the house of Carr—it is in Belgrave Mews at the back of Belgrave-square—I saw the lead which I left on the premises in the shop at half-past eight o clock on Friday morning the 16th when I returned from breakfast—I saw Buckingham and Holden there were more men there—Carr was not there—Woodfield was—I saw Buckingham take a piece of lead on his shoulder out of the shop in company with Holden about a quarter before nine o clock—they went away together—it was the piece I had left the day before—it is here— producing it —I have examined it and am certain it is the same piece—I was afterwards at Can s house—I was sent for when I came back at one o clock—I found the officers Edwards and Thatcher there—Holden was in custody—I saw the officers bring the piece of lead down stairs from Carr s house Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Is not Mr Carr s a very respectable shop and he in a very large way of business A Not that I know of—I was never in his shop before—I did not measure the shop—I have been in the police and resigned—I was not discharged—there might be complaints made against me before I resigned—I was nearly three years in the police—there were complaints of neglect of duty by being late of a morning—I do not know How many complaints were made—there might be a hundred for what I know—I resigned perhaps a week or fortnight after the last complaint—I cannot say How for Carr s house is from where I was at work—I will not swear it is not two hundred yards—I had no notice that I was to be dismissed before I resigned—I was not dismissed Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Mr Smitlh has an extensive business A Yes—when I returned at half-past eight o clock there were about eight persons on the premises and the foreman among them—Buckingham walked out with the lead and Holden followed him MR PAYNE Q After seeing Buckingham and Holden go away with the lead did you give information to Adams A Yes—he is foreman of the joiners CON MINING I am labourer to Davis who is a working plumber in Mr Smith s employ On Friday morning the 16th of March I was in the plutmber s shop and saw Buckingham and Holden come in—at eight o clock they had breakfast in the shop and a little before nine o clock Woodfield came in—Holden asked him for a piece of lead for a gutter—Buckingham was present—he might be the width of the shop away he must have heard what was said—Woodfield said I have sent up the gutters yesterday —they were wanted at Grosvenor-crescent—Holden said there was one short—Woodfield pointed to the lower end of the shop and said There is a piece you may take that —Buckingham who is Holden s labourer took it up put it on his shoulder and walked out of the shop—Holden followed him directly—the lead was not weighed or measured at that time—I saw a piece of Lead afterwards at the police office—I cannot swear it was the same Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Who else was in the shop A Davis and there were men in and out WILLIAM ADAMS I am foreman of the joiners at Mr Smith s This plan looking at if accurately represents the plumber s shop and the buildings erecting in Belgrave-square—a person going from the shop to the square would have no business in the Mews if he went in a direct line—on Friday morning the 16th of March I received information from Fitzgibbon a little before nine o clock and followed Buckingham and Holden—I went through a building in Eaton-square and saw them both in Belgrave-street—Holden was near Eaton-place and Buckingham had just turned the corner of Chapel-street which leads to Belgrave Mews—Carr s house is in the Mews—Holden was some distance behind Buckingham—I ran into Chapel-street and stood by the corner of Belgrave Mews where I had a view of Carr s house—I stood there about five minutes and saw Buckingham come out of Carr s house with the fingers of his right hand in his waistcoat pocket as if he had put something into his pocket—he had no lead on his shoulder nor had Holden any that I could see—Buckingham went into the Coachmaker s Arms a few doors from Carr s—I then returned and gave information to the police—I accompanied the officer to Carr s house between twelve and one o clock—Carr was at home—I asked if he had purchased a piece of lead that morning—he said he had not that he had been from home to town to purchase lead he had been away in short from six that morning—I saw his wife in the shop and asked her—she said no there had been no lead purchased—Thatcher the officer asked Carr if he would allow him to look round—he said yes and I believe he also said that was all the sheet lead he had got in the house pointing to what was in the shop—a few words passed between him and Thatcher which I do not recollect—I went down into the cellar and found a great quantity of lead—there was sheet lead there—the officers went up stairs and brought down some more lead Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How many tons of lead were there on his premises A I suppose two tons—Carr said he was not at home in the morning JOHN HONE I am gate-keeper at some buildings which Mr Smith is erecting in Belgrave-square Holden and Buckingham were taken into custody on Friday the 16th of March—I remember Holden returning to the premises that morning after breakfast at near nine o clock—they were plumbers at work at that building—Holden returned about nine o clock—I opened the gate and let him come in—he had no lead with him—I saw Buckingham come in seven or ten minutes after Holden—he bad no lead with him JOHN EDWARDS On the morning of Thursday the 15th of March I received information from Fitzgibbon and on Friday the 16th I went to Carr s shop a little before one o clock—I had seen Buckingham and Holden go there about twelve o clock and beard Buckingham ask if Mr Carr was at home—I was close behind Buckingham—I took him into custody but found nothing on him relating to this charge—my brother-officer took Holden into custody—after they were in custody I and Thatcher went to Carr s house a little before one o clock—he came home while we were there—I told him we had received information that a piece of sheet or gutter lead had been sold there about nine o clock in the morning and requested him to allow us to look to see if we could find it—he at first refused saying all the sheet lead he had was in his shop—I did not hear Thatcher say any thing further but he called him on one side—we afterwards asked him if he had not a place down in the cellar where he kept lead—he said Yes then is some old lead down there but no new lead —we then asked him to let us see what there was—I and Thatcher Carr and I believe Adams went down into the kitchen and found a quantity of lead doubled up—we brought that away—after moving it out of the cellar Mrs Carr was in the shop and I requested permission to go up stains to see if I could find the lead—she at first refused—Carr was not there—I went up stairs to the top of the house and in a cock-loft there was a bed at one corner and a cistern in the other half full of water and in that cistern I found the piece of lead rolled up in much the same state as it is now—there was nobody in the room—I brought it down to my brother-officer Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q On the oath yon have taken did Mr Carr ever refuse to let you search his shop A He hesitated as I said before—he refused at first to let us see—Thatcher was present and I believe Adams also—Carr did not say in my presence that he had not been at home all the morning—I do not recollect it GEORGE THATCHER police-constable B 17 I went with Edwards to Caff on the 16th of March having received information—Carr came home about the time I got there the second time—the first time I went at twelve o clock I apprehended Buckingham—the second time I went Carr was at home—that was a little before one o clock—I asked him if he had any objection to our searching the house—he objected at first and hesitated—after some considerable time be allowed me but previous to his allowing me he requested me to accompany him to a public-house with a friend of his to take some ale which I refused—Edwards and Adams were in the shop at the time—they were near enough to hear it—Edwards was invited as well as me—Carr said I hope you will not make any great disturbance about this circumstance as I do not wish this person to know any thing about it meaning the person that was going to the public-house with him—I do not know who that was—I searched and found a quantity of lead in the kitchen—Edwards found a piece of lead in a extern and gave it to me in a wet state Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q He invited you and Edwards to go into the public-house in the presence of Adams A Yes it was said in the presence of the three—I know he invited Edwards also—it was a general invitation to the whole three—I have no doubt they must have heard it—I cannot say that Adams was invited—there were three of us—I suppose the invitation was for all—I told the solicitor about this—I will not swear that I said it before the Magistrate—I refused to go to the public-house—I do not know what reply Edwards made—my object was to keep the house in view—Edwards was perhaps two or three yards from me or two or three feet—we were all close together—I cannot say what reply Adams made—Carr said he had not been at home all the morning Evidence for the Defence WILLIAM NELSON I am a master plumber and live in Harrow-street Paddington I remember Friday morning the 16th of March the day Carr was taken into custody—about twenty minutes after seven o clock that morning I went to Mr Carr s for the purpose of seeing him—he was not at home—I remained there till about twenty minutes to ten o clock—I had an appointment at ten o clock—during all that time he did not come home—I called again two or three days afterwards and learned that he had been taken into custody—he is a plumber and glazier in a large way of business Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What time did you leave his house A About half-past nine or twenty minutes to ten o clock—I remained there from about half-past seven o clock waiting there talking to one of his men and when the men went to breakfast Mrs Carr said she expected him in immediately—I saw no man come in a little before nine o clock with a roll of lead—if there had been I must have seen it—I am confident about the day it was a Friday morning—I believe it was three weeks last Friday—I had to give in a contract for a job and I wanted to consult him—I had to give in my contract on the 22nd and this was on the Friday previous—I never saw Buckingham before—I am quite sure he did not come in with any lead—I carry on business in Harrow-road—I have known Carr about six years—he has carried on that business ever since I have known him—it is not an uncommon thing to have rolls of lead in a cistern half full of water—it might be placed there to repair the cistern and the water come in after it was put in before the job was done and that would stop the job—some one came into the shop while I was there but not with lead—I did not take particular notice who it was—the person came to the door and asked if Mr Carr was at home—he was told no—I was talking to two workmen in the shop EDWARD EXTON I am a plumber I have been in Mr Carrs employ six and a half or seven years—I was at home on the morning Mr Carr was taken into custody—I went to work about six o clock and went back about eight—during that time Mr Carr was not in his house—I returned from breakfast about half-past eight o clock—my master was not at home then—Mr Nelson came in at half-past seven o clock and remained there till I returned from breakfast—he left I should say at half-past nine o clock—a person called about a quarter before nine o clock and asked if Mr Carr was at home—I said he was not—I think I have seen that lead before—I cannot swear to the lead which was taken out of my master s cistern—I put some there—the cistern required mending it was very bad for some time—I had put it in the day before the 16th of March—there was no water in the cistern at the time—after I cleared the cistern out I was called away and did not think of turning the water off and it came in on Thursday night or Friday morning—my master came home on Friday—I did not see him at all MR PAYNE Q When did you begin to mend the holes in the cistern A They have not been mended at all—there was water ran through the cistern—there were holes in the cistern and it also ran out of the pipe—I pat the lead there for a new bottom—it was rolled up—I took it up thinking it might do with other pieces which had laid on one side for a day or two—I cannot say How long the cistern bad been made—a man came and asked if Mr Can was at home—I did not take much notice of him—he had nothing with him—Buckingham was there at nine o clock in the morning—my master keeps his scales in the lower shop—that is the cellar—our shop is very small—we have no convenience for them in the shop—we do not keep sheet lead down in the cellar—these are cuttings MR PHILLIPS Q Does your master do a great deal of business A Yes a great deal MOSES BARNET I am a carpenter On Friday March 16th I was with Carr in Pall Mall between eleven and twelve o clock—it might be twenty minutes after

never been discovered—the prisoner Armstrong was introduced to me by my family he paid his addresses to Nevin—I employed him at 3s 6d a week to put up the shutters at night to take them down in the morning and clean the windows—after the burglary he remained in the house at night—I know nothing about this case JAMES MAY I am a coal-merchant and live in West-square The prisoner Armstrong was in my service in April last and had been so for about twelve months—I have a stable at the corner of Ely-place in West-square and over that a sleeping room for the servant—Armstrong slept there—inconsequence of information on Wednesday the 4th of April I went to that room and found three pieces of new cloth or sheeting concealed between the bed-clothes and the bed—I suppose there were about twenty-four or twenty-five yards—I did not meddle with it but on Saturday the 7th I went again and it was gone—on Wednesday the 11th I went again about half-past eight o clock in the evening and found two deal boxes partly covered over with empty sacks—one was locked and the other loosely corded and cracked across the lid—I removed as far at I could a portion of the lid and discovered that the box contained new linen gloves and some ribbons—I could see through the crack without removing the did that the box contained some new cloth—I went and informed Mr Williams—he returned with me to the room and in my presence opened the box which was loosely corded and cracked in the lid and took from it a variety of articles which be claimed—we went to his premises at Newwington causeway and returned a second time to the room and saw some more things which the prosecutor claimed—we then went back to Mr Williams s and saw the prisoner Armstrong there shutting up the shutters—I called him into the shop and asked him if those two deal boxes with their contents which I had found in his sleeping room over my stable were his property—he said they were I put the question again and his answer was the same—I told him to be careful what he was saying and asked him a third time repeating the same words—he then said that a part of the property belonged to him and a part to Sarah Nevin—I asked him if any of the property in the boxes belonged to Mr Williams—he said no—I said We must go to the stable and examine and Mr Williams prosecutor s nephew Armstrong and myself went there—I had the of the room in my pocket—Mr Williams then opened the box that was corded and took out a great variety of articles which he identified by his private mark—I asked Armstrong what he thought of it now at fee had said there was nothing in the boxes belonging to Mr Williams—he made no reply—I cannot recollect that he said he did not know any thing of them—I asked him where the key of the box was that was locked—he took from his waistcoat pocket a small key and gave it to Mr Williams who opened the box with it—in the mean time I sent for an officer—Mr Williams found a great quantity of articles in that box alto which he claimed and some property claimed by Mr Williams was also found under the bed tied up in a handkerchief and another bundle in the chaise-house which the prisoner had the occupation of Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Is this a chaise-house belonging to yourself A The stable is on one side of the chaise-house attached—it is all under one lock and key—I had one key and the prisoner had another—the bundle was under tome tacks there at the extremity—I did not direct him to keep any empty sacks in his sleeping room but there were some over the boxes—it was on the 11th I taw the boxes—they were not there before—I have no recollection of his saying he did not know any thing of the property being Mr Williams t—I will not swear that he did not THOMAS SMITH WILLIAMS I am the prosecutor s nephew and superintend his business On Wednesday the 11th of April I received information from Mr May and went with him to the room over hit stable—I uncorded one of the boxes there and found tome articles belonging to my uncle—they were the articles stated in the indictment—a variety of them are linen goods and are new—they bore my uncle s mark—some of them had been missed from the shop—I returned with Mr May to my uncle s—when Armstrong was spoken to he said he was willing for me to see the boxes and we all went together—Mr May has given a true as count of the conversation that passed—when we went to the room I again took the articles out of the corded box and then opened the other with the key—that also contained articles belonging to my uncle and the bundles also—they were not all new Cross-examined Q How came you to claim those that were not new A The girl acknowledged that she had taken them—I speak of them to the best of my belief—we missed some of the things very recently before—the new articles found in the boxes and bundles were worth about 14l MR CLARKSON Q Was there one of the pillow-cases that had been used at your uncle s A Yes—it has his mark on it—Nevin s wages were 8l a-year—we had missed some of the articles since the burglary THOMAS RILEY police-con stable L 125 I was sent for to take Armstrong—I received these two boxes from Mr Williams PHILIP FROWD police-sergeant L 6 On Thursday morning the 12th of April I brought Armstrong and Nevin from the station to the office—Nevin asked if J could tell her whether she would be transported for this offence or no—I told her that was a question I could not answer but I cautioned her to be very careful what she said for it would be repeated by me at the office—she went on with her conversation stating that she took the whole of the articles herself and gave them to Armstrong to take can of and that he was innocent of it—that she had taken them at different times and given them to him to take care of—she also stated that Armstrong always believed that she had bought these articles—when we got is the office she wanted a handkerchief for her own use out of the bundle in which had I found some of the articles—she got one out and stated that those were some of the things which she had taken from Mr Williams—I am not aware which bundle that was—it was one that had some of her dirty things in it—I sorted them out from the other bundles at the office in to presence—she pointed out the articles with Mr Williams s mark on them—I took possession of those articles and have had them ever since Cross-examined Q Then out of the things claimed by Mr Williams you selected some dirty things of hers and the handkerchief A Yes—I took the new articles and left the dirty ones—neither of the Mr Williams s could speak positively to those things but one pair of the stocking they thought was theirs THOMAS SMITH WILLIAMS re-examined Here is a pattern of a print in this bundle that we have had but it is not marked—there is nothing here that we claim—the new and old things were mixed indifferently in the boxes—any one that opened them must have seen that there were new things in them THOMAS RILEY re-examined I heard Nevin make a statement before the Magistrate and saw the Magistrate sign it—it was taken down in writing at the time—I did not overlook it—I believe this to be the same— looking at it PHILIP FROWD re-examined I heard Armstrong make a statement at the office and saw it written down correctly word for word and signed by the Magistrate— read —The prisoner Armstrong says I was going to be married to Sarah Nevin in a short time—she brought the things to me to take care of—there was no sheeting that I put between my bedclothes and bed—the only sheeting was with the other things in the boxes MR MAY re-examined I never observed Armstrong or Nevin in the stable—I was not at all aware of his going to Mr Williams s to sleep—I have not the least doubt that it was sheeting I saw in the bed—there were three pieces containing from twenty-four to twenty-five yards in each piece—nobody but myself and Armstrong could have access to that place

Frenchman and so is the prisoner—I did not apprise him before he was taken that I suspected he had I got gloves at his house—he was never asked whether he had taken gloves from time to time to his house for the purpose of dressing them—I did not see any part of the property found at the prisoner s—the greater part of this property requires to undergo the process of dressing—they are cut at Battersea sewn at Torrington and then come to us in Aldermanbury to be dressed for sale—there were two Englishmen employed as dressers besides the prisoner—I am not able to identify any of this as property that has been missed—we could not miss any—we manufacture about four hundred dozen a week and without we take stock we could not miss any—we have taken stock si nee this but have not missed these articles—it is impossible to tell what we lose—we cannot tell whether we have lost any MR PAYNE Q Have you the least doubt that these are yours A Not the least the leather goes through my hands EDWARD M DOWELL City policeman I was sent for to Aldermanbury and received the prisoner in charge—I got these two keys from him and went with Mr Fousse to No 9 Steward s-buildings Battersea where the prisoner lodged—the keys he gave me opened the doors—we went into a little back sitting-room and there found some gloves—I locked the doors and fastened the windows down and returned to Aldermanbury—I kept the keys in my possession—I went again on the Saturday evening and in the bed-room found one hundred and forty dozen pairs of gloves io a straw mattress under two more wool mattresses—I also found two skins one pound of silk seven dozen pairs of gloves some books and an opera glass—I brought them away Cross-examined Q When you went on the previous day did you find property about in different parts of the room A Yes—I found forty-seven dozen in the back room all open—I went into the bed-room on the Friday but did not find these things then FREDERICK FOUSSE I live in Aldermanbury and am In partnership with my father The prisoner was in our service—I was present with M Dowell when this property was found on the Saturday—I know it to beours—the prisoner had no right to have them there Cross-examined Q How did you engage the prisoner A A year ago he was to put out our gloves and put them in dozens—I am not a partner with Mr Angell—he has an interest in the house and has a percentage on the profits of the concern—if we lose property Mr Angell would lose his share in the percentage—he has one per cent on what he sells—the name of Fousse and Co is over the door—Mr Angell and myself make out the bills of parcels—anybody in the house gives receipts—it is the warehouse of my father and myself Q Supposing this man had taken borne a lot of gloves to dress and brought them back you would not have charged him with any offence A That I do not know—I should have asked him what right he had to do so—he had no occasion to take them home—he had 30s a week MR CLARKSON to THOMAS ANGELL Q Did you have any conversation with the prisoner about an opera glass A I do not speak French and could not—my son speaks French and be acted as interpreter between the prisoner and me—I transact the business of Mr Fousse and have one per cent on the business—I do not pay them for any losses—I did not pay the prisoner his salary—it went through my hands—I pay the whole of the men every Saturday night with Mr Fousse s money GUILTY Aged 36 — Transported for Seven Years

and called out to the other lads and then he said he thought I was Thomas—he asked me which way I was going—I said I was going home—he asked me whether Thomas was come out—I said Yes some time —I asked him what he wanted with him—he said he had got a ticket for the play—he then said he had been in a public-house and he had heard a man say there was a robbery at Davey and M Murdo s—that he asked him if he knew any thing about it and he said No —he asked me if I knew any thing about it—I said No -Clift then said the man s name was Smith—I said Surely it is not Smith -Clift then said he thought it very strange that I should be in such a firm and not know there was a robbery—he then walked with me some distance and said I dare say you are an acute lad do you go to that public-house for your dinner —I said No I go where I like —he then said Between you and I I want an article at present —he mentioned the name of it but I do not know what it was—he then asked what capacity I was in in the firm—I said The same as Thomas —he said Between you and I if any thing should be done you would not let any one know it not let Thomas know it —I said No —he then said Hot are you off for opium I said we had about two cwt —he said How are you off for saffron I said we had about four cwt—he then said How are you off for Tonquin beans I said we always kept a good stock of them—he then said Out of two cwt of opium you could take about thirty pounds —I said How — Oh he said put some into your pockets some on your groin and some under your arms and bring it out by degrees —he then said I could bring about ten pounds of saffron and I could bring some Tonquin beans and when it came to 6l worth he would wrap it in a bit of paper advertise it and offer 6l reward and I should take it to him and receive the 6l —I asked him what price he would give me—he said the same as Tom—that was 2s for opium and 2s for saffron—he did not mention the price for Tonquin beans—I said Two shillings for opium that is worth a guinea a pound —he said 2s was what he gave Tom but he would give me 3s for opium and saffron 5l 4s a cwt for Tonquin beans and I was to meet him at the public-house in Duke-street with as many articles as I could get him—I told him I would talk to him on Monday- this was on Saturday —I was going to leave him and he offered me 6d —I said I would not take it then I would take it on Monday—he wished me to take it and drink his health—I said No —he said Come and have a pint of beer —I said Then you can give me the prices what you will give me —we went into the public-house and he wrote down on this paper reads 3s for opium 3S for saffron and 5l 4s a cwt for Tonquin beans —he wished me to drink and I put it to my lips but would not swallow any—he wished me to finish it—I said No it was bad—I asked him how he first came to know Tom—he said he was sleeping with a girl at his house and then he said If you must know I keep a b-y-house —I then said Perhaps you can get us a girl on purpose to find out where he lived—he said That could be done where could he meet me on Sunday—I told him I bad some business to attend to—he said Could you meet me at the Half-way House Commercial-road on Sunday evening —I said Yes and with that I left him—I went home and told my father who took me to the foreman and he to to the inspector—I met Clift on Sunday at the Half-way Houses—he was talking to a young man—I went and shook hands with him—he said Excuse me for a few minutes —he went and spoke to the man and then he came to me and walked down the road with me—he said he had been talking to Poll about me—I said I had no money—he asked how much I had—I said A penny that is all I am allowed —he said Come on and he took me down the road and turned off down a turning to the right—he told me to stop there and he would talk to some young women who were there—I heard one young woman say to him That can be done and the young woman went into a house-Clift followed her and they called me in- the officer had desired me to go wherever Clift took me —I went in and sat down—I saw Clift give a shilling to another woman and she went out—I came away and made an appointment to see clift again on the Monday about one o clock with some opium corrosive-sublimate ginger and nutmegs—I mentioned that to the officer and to Mr Davey my master and on Monday I was furnished with some opium which was marked—I carried it to the place where I was to meet Clift—he ran up to me and I said Take the opium —he said Don t you be seen with me —the officer then took him ALFRED LANAGAN I am the brother of Thomas Lanagan I remember his coming home and making a statement—I went with him to the officer on the Sunday evening and my father went to Mr Davey

there to the prisoner Smith s house I saw Smith leave his work several times—I noticed that on his way home he appeared very bulky about his pockets and on his return he appeared quite empty—I went afterwards to his house and searched it—I found in a box on the first floor where I ascertained he lodged a variety of articles—I afterwards received information from the boy Lanagan—I gave him directions and followed him—he acted according to my directions—I saw him meet Clift and I then took Clift into custody—he attempted to knock me down—I took charge of the opium which he had and have it here—I have not been to Clift s house but I know prostitutes live there CHARLES DAVEY I am in partnership with Mr M Murdo—I have no other partner About the 1st of September I saw Whipp s father and

my dear —she said No —I said Are you not waiting for your husband who works over the way —she said No —she then walked away—I watched her and when she came to the corner of Russell-place she took to her heels and ran as fast as she could—I followed and brought her to Mrs Parke s house followed by the man who came and fetched us as I did not know where Mrs Parke lived—I brought Richards into the parlour and saw Mitchell take the pocket-book from her hand-Berkshire afterwards came in—she was brought in and pulled out of her pocket this purse and some keys—this purse with the duplicates in it is just as it was when it was taken from her—I asked Where did you get these duplicates from —she said From Betsey —that was the first she said—she said I saw Betsey last about a month ago —I said How can that be you have got a duplicate here that was pledged only yesterday —she said Oh I forgot I saw Betsey yesterday —I then took possession of them and have kept them safe ever since COURT Q Have you said the whole A Yes—when Berkshire came in she put the purse on the seat with some keys—I opened the purse and asked where she got the duplicates from—she said From Betsey —I never heard her say that they were her property COURT to WILLIAM MITCHELL Q When she said they were her own might that have applied to some keys that were there or must it have applied to the duplicates A It might have applied to the keys or the duplicates I cannot say which—there was such confusion at the time we could not tell what we were about hardly THOMAS WALKER I am shopman to my mother who is a pawnbroker at No 41 York-road Lambeth I produce a tea-spoon pledged on the 10th of May 1838—I have the duplicate—it is attached to it—I have another tea-spoon pawned on the next day—I have the counter duplicates to all these things also a shirt and a napkin—I produce a silver box pawned by a female who is not in custody—I know the female perfectly well—she had been in the habit of using my shop—she was dressed exceedingly well—she said it belonged to her aunt—I have an opera-glass pledged by the same lady—she did not look td me like a servant—the initials H K P are on the spoons—they were pawned in the name of Brown-here is H K P a horn and a Latin motto on this silver box—it was pawned in the name of Brown—I produce two sheets pledged by the same person a table-spoon and two dessert spoons- H K P are on three of them and S L on the other from the same lady—on the 22nd of October I saw the prisoner Gibbs—she produced a duplicate of four spoons pledged for 1l and wanted to redeem part of them—she asked for the table-spoon—I wished her to pay 10s for that—she could not give it me—she paid the interest and had a fresh ticket made out—these spoons were pawned by the same lady-Gibb wanted me to take 8s for the table-spoon and I would not—I have compared seven of these duplicates with seven that Mitchell produced and they all correspond Gibb On my oath I never was in your shop-look at me that is all I ask Witness I am certain it was you JAMES LOCKYER I live with Mr Marson in Blackfriars-road a pawn-broker I have a dessert fork and the duplicate—it was pawned on the 27th of August by Gibb—on the 30th of August three table forks were pawned by the same person—they have been in the house two or three years off and on—I thought by the way she spoke that she was a char-woman and had pawned them for her mistress—she said They are mine —she had pawned property three or four years and came and paid for them which put me off my guard—there are initials on them—I did not ask her what her mistress s name was—they never will give us the name if we ask them—she said They are mine —I thought she was sent by some person—I knew her in the neighbourhood for six or seven years—I produce this silver basket pawned about the 18th of October for 20s -Gibb came on the Monday following and pawned a metal watch for 10s —she came on the watch brought the ticket of the basket and some wanted to redeem the watch and said she would leave the basket and some forks—I have compared these duplicates with those produced by Mitchell—they all three correspond—they are all in the same name and address Ann

in Tottenham-court road I produce a table-cloth pawned on the 8th of May—I do not know who by—I have examined a duplicate in the possession of Mitchell and it corresponds with mine THOMAS WALKER I

Yes—she was very well dressed and behaved herself as a lady JAMES SMITH I am shopman to Mr Jones a pawnbroker in High Holborn I have a tea-spoon which was pawned—I do not know who pawned it—it is in the name of Mary Richards No 4 Gloucester-street—my duplicate corresponds with the one found by Mitchell WILLIAM CHARLES GRAYGOOSE I am shopman to Mr Basset of Great Queen-street I have a shirt pawned on the 3rd of March 1838 by Richards in the name of Ann Richards—I am sure it was her—I produce a book pawned on the 12th of October in the name of Ann Richard and a shift and bed-gown pledged by her on the same day—I believe it was her—I am not quite certain—they are pawned in the same name and address—I have a blanket for 2s 6d three boots for 2s two towels an apron for 1s all in the same name and address—the whole amounts to 10s 6d GEORGE KING Hive with George Gray a pawnbroker in Fleet-street I have four books pawned on the 16th Of October also a whittle a flannel jacket and a table-cloth—I have seen Gibb and Richards in the shop and Berkshire also I believe but I cannot swear to her—this is my hand-writing and my name to this deposition— reads — I have seen Gibb Berkshire and Richards in my shop —I feel certain in myself that I have seen her—I have examined two of these duplicates and compared them with those produced by Mitchell and they agree Gibb Q Did I ever pawn

name of Ann Richards —I know the prisoner Richards—she has pledged at my shop—I have examined this duplicate with the one produced by Mitchell—they correspond—I produce a gown-piece a pair of shoes a shirt and towel—the two last were pledged on the 2nd of October the gown-piece in September in the name of Ann Richards No 11 Queen-street —she had frequently pawned at our shop—that is how I knew

pawned the same day by the same person I suppose but I cannot say they may have been taken in at the same time—there is a shift in the name of Ann Richards —I cannot recollect whether that was pawned by the same person—I have compared the duplicates—they correspond with those found by Mitchell MRS PARKE re-examined This property is mine—there is no mark on this shirt—I will not say any thing is mine that I do not know—this book I know is mine SARAH TWINER On Thursday the 1st of November I was in Mrs Parke s kitchen—I found some tickets and some keys behind the gas-meter in the kitchen—I gave them to Mrs Parke MRS PARKE re-examined I received them—they were keys that opened my drawers but they were not mine—I tried them and two of them opened closets in which I deposited all my keys when I

value 2l 12s 2 cups value 6l 8s 3 tea-pots value 33l 1 coffee-pot value 14l 17s 1 sugar-basin value 8l 1 jug value 5l 14s and 1 watch value 20l the goods of Henry John Lias and another his masters MR DOANE conducted the prosecution HENRY JOHN LIAS I live at No 8 Finsbury-square The prisoner was in the employ of myself and partner for three months as clerk and town traveller at 80l a year—it was his duty among other things to carry out goods on approbation—on Friday the 12th of October I sent him out with the articles here enumerated—he was to show them to a person in the City and bring them back—he did so and also on the following day—on Monday the 15th he took them again and asked me if he might take the gold watch in the drawer to show saying I think you said you would take 20l for it —I said yes—I have the book in which is the list of the things enumerated with the exception of the gold watch and they were entered on the 12th—I saw no more of the prisoner till the 6th of November when I found him in custody—I have never got my gold watch and there is one child s cup missing—the value of the whole property was about 118l Cross-examined by MR JONES Q Did you receive a good character with the prisoner A I did from Mr Savory—I allowed him no commission in any way—I have never made any remuneration or present to him after he had sold a lot of goods for us and never promised him any—on one occasion he took a journey into the country and was absent seven or eight days—he charged his expenses and I paid him—I did not allow him any thing as a present to himself—I never promised him a commission or bonus on what he sold-no conversation ever took plate between us on the subject—he has been trusted with property to a larger amount than this—I should say 500l or 600l —I think not to the amount of 800l or 900l —he was authorised to sell all the articles with the exception of one tea-pot which was a pattern one—he was authorised to sell the rest at the price fixed in the indictment nothing below that—I swear he had no discretion—I left nothing to his judgment—the amount of the whole was 118l —he was not authorised to sell at less than that—he would not have been allowed to sell at five per cent off that—I had taken the per centage off—his directions were to sell them for ready money—the party he went to Mr Savory was a ready-money customer—he was not restricted from selling them to any other person if he sold them at the price fixed—he has not on other occasions exercised his own judgment as to what price he was to sell at—I gave him these on the 12th and the last time I saw him was on the 15th—he locked them up in the iron safe on my premises at night and took them out in the morning—these were quite new goods and fashionable articles—they were what is called shaped —some of them were very richly chased-a great part of the work was done by the maker and that is very expensive-if it had been left as it came from the maker it would not be plain it would be shaped—the shaping is the ornament—this is a shaped tea-pot— showing one —it is chased-part of it was done by the maker and part by the chaser-if it were shaped only it would be much cheaper than if it was chased—this is not the cottage tea-pot—the prisoner had no authority to sell this tea-pot at any price—this is the one that was merely for show—he was to sell the others by weight and fashion—he would have sold them by the whole set—I have a copy of the list which he took with him—I did not make it at the time—I made it from this book which contains the list of the articles but not the prices—the prices he had with him—I made out this list after his apprehension not after I had indicted him nor after I had charged him at the police-office—it was after I caused him to be taken into custody—I was not straitened in circumstances for ready money at the time I gave the prisoner these articles—I did not tell him when I gave him them that they and other stock must be turned into money as I did not know how to turn or how to go on for cash—he might have sold these things for 118l with the exception of this tea-pot—he had no general authority to sell to whom he chose without he sold for ready money—these articles would be worth about 12s an ounce to a trader-8s or 10s would not be a fair price—there are articles here that are 16s an ounce—I do not know that there are silversmiths who would sell them for much less than that MR DOANE Q You have stated a price below which he was not to sell these articles A Yes—he was not authorised to sell any at the rate of 8s 6d an ounce—the price at which he was to sell them would average about 12s an ounce—I did not authorise him to walk off with the gold watch—this is the property he had— looking at it SAMUEL LAWRENCE I live in Agar-street Strand On Sunday the 4th of November I received this letter in consequence of which I went to the Russell coffee-house in Windmill-street—I found the prisoner there—I ultimately bought this property of him for 70l 10s 9d at 8s 3d an ounce—I paid him some on account—I sold it the next day to Mr Solomon for 81l 4s Cross-examined Q Was 8s 3d a fair price A It was HENRY SOLOMONS This is the property that I got from Mr Lawrence COURT Q When did you buy it A On the 5th of November at twelve o clock at 9s 6d an ounce—I paid 81l 4s for it—on the Tuesday I left for Brighton for a week Cross-examined Q You bought them from a trader A Yes—I have known him for twenty years—he produced them on the counter and I was looking over them for some time JAMES BRANNAN police-constable G 20 I went and got this property from Mr Solomons Cross-examined Q Did yon not hear the prisoner say he had been in liquor and lost the money A I did not HENRY JOHN LIAS re-examined I believe this letter to be the prisoner s writing—I have seen him write—this is his writing in the book Cross-examined Q Have you been comparing this with other writing of his A Not at all—I think it is in his ordinary hand-writing—I have not the least doubt about it Letter read — Sunday morning Mr Walford jeweller &c from Liverpool was recommended to Mr Lawrence as being likely to purchase a quantity of new plate which Mr W has brought up with him from Liverpool for immediate disposal It consists of tea plate in sets and mugs mustard-pots &c nearly all of which are gilt inside and quite new modern and about 200 oz In explaining that it must be sold immediately and at a great sacrifice no doubt it is necessary Mr W should explain that having a very pressing engagement to pay a sum of money on Tuesday morning in Liverpool which will after Christmas yield Mr W an enormous profit he is induced to make the temporary sacrifice for one that will be so much more to his advantage Mr W begs to say he must be in Liverpool on Tuesday morning with at least 50l in cash the remainder as might be agreed upon Mr W would not object to a bill Mr W only came in just now from Liverpool and if Mr L will call on him at the Russell coffee-house 26 Great Windmill-street he can see the goods and Mr W will wait at home this morning to see him Thomas Hughes Headland No 13 Great

oil-shop—I went in and saw Harwood and March there and the bag which I had seen before was on the weighing-machine—Harwood was taking the money off the counter as I went in and March was behind the counter—the bag contained thirty-six pounds of Russia tallow—I asked Harwood what he did there—he said he came to buy soap and soda—I pointed to the bag—he then immediately began to cry and begged I would forgive him as his father had died that morning and he did it to buy a coffin—I told March I was surprised he should buy tallow of such a boy as that—he made me no answer—he was serving a customer at the time—he asked me to walk into his parlour—I did so and he told me he bought it in consequence of the boy representing that his father was a pastry-cook and this was his perquisite that he said it was dripping and he bought it for dripping—I said I thought that was impossible for I remembered him coming to our shop to buy candles and putting them to his nose to try the quality—I thought he could not make that mistake—I left the shop and gave Harwood into custody—I went again and saw March—I asked him how much he had of it—he shewed me two casks which had been in his possession—I asked if that was the whole he had got—he said he believed that was the whole—I said he must know if he had any more—he said no he believed he had not—Harwood was not there then—Mrs March came and asked me to look over the place—I went into the passage and found another cask—I said You forgot this —he said Yes I had forgotten that —I asked him what he had given the boy for it—he said 21/2d per pound as dripping—I said that was a very inferior price as we were giving for common kitchen-stuff 36s and 38s per cwt—I told him it cost us 60s per cwt which would be about 61/2d per pound—I then took March into custody—there was about 21/2 cwt altogether in the three casks—I believe it to be my tallow Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Did he not say I had no idea it was tallow A Yes—I searched a warehouse of his at a distance from the shop at his wife s request but found nothing there—the two casks I saw were in the shop—one was under the counter the other I think had a cover on but I am not sure—they were old butter-firkins such as are used to put kitchen-stuff in—the third cask was in the passage leading to the warehouse—I had to pass it to go to the warehouse—21/2d per pound is what is given in shops for kitchen-stuff COURT Q Is Russia tallow like kitchen-stuff A Not at all to me either in tight or smell but I am a tallow-chandler EDWIN RICHARD I am in the prosecutor s service I found this bag in the cellar—I showed it to my master and replaced it where I found it by his desire—the prisoner went down into the cellar about dinner time—I went down soon after and missed the bag—I afterwards saw the prisoner come out with the bag on his shoulder and watched him to March s shop GEORGE BUCKHAM I am in the prosecutor s service I saw Harwood take away the bag and followed him into March s shop—I stood outside and looked through the window—I saw Harwood put the bag on the machine and March weighed it—it was then placed against a salt-bin—March came to the counter and paid Harwood—I cannot say how much it was silver—Harwood took a reckoner from his pocket looked at it and said that was right—the bag was not opened at all—I then called my master—I heard Harwood say he came there to buy soap and soda—he afterwards admitted that he took it to buy his father a coffin Cross-examined Q I believe his father is dead A Yes—he had died that morning between seven and eight o clock WILLIAM SHAW police-constable H 112 I was sent for and took March into custody—I was there some time—he said he was ill—I was ordered to stay by him till the surgeon was sent for—he came and examined him and he was taken to the station-house—he said it was a bad job MR BODKIN called THOMAS CODD I am an oil-man and live in Chiswell-street I have known March seventeen or eighteen years—he has borne a most excellent character—the shop in Lamb-street was taken by his son about three months ago to carry on the business of an Italian warehouseman which his employers are—the prisoner was only there to take care of the goods for his son—I valued the stock when the shop was taken—I do not think the prisoner knew the name of one article in the shop—he came and asked me several times to tell him what different things were—the shop was advertised to be let shortly after and the prisoner continued to have charge of it till a tenant was found—I deal in kitchen-stuff and dripping—it is sold at 2d a lb in retail shops—not one person in twenty out of the trade would know the difference between dripping and Russia tallow—children generally bring such things — MILLER I am an oil-man I occupied the shop before it was let to the prisoner s son—the prisoner expressed his utter ignorance of the quality and name of most of the things—I was often called in to tell the name of things and I expressed my opinion that he was very unfit to remain there—I deal in kitchen-stuff and tallow—there is a great deal of difference in kitchen-stuff in a melted state—a man might mistake tallow for it — PEACOCK I have been in the melting trade and have had large dealings with tallow-chandlers—I think it very difficult to distinguish tallow from kitchen-stuff—I have bought kitchen-stuff as good as any tallow—I knew the prisoner as a grocer and believe he was not at all acquainted with these things JOHN JENKINS I am a trunk-maker and live in Liverpool-street Bishopsgate-street I recommended the prisoner s son to this shop THOMAS WILLIAM MARCH I am the prisoner s son and am in the employ of Kennett and Eaton I took the shop in Lamb-street some months ago to carry on the pickle and foreign fruit trade—I altered my intention and advertised to let it—my father had no interest in the trade whatever—he was only there till I could let the shop—he was not at all acquainted with tallow or kitchen-stuff—he never saw any till he came there CHARLES EATON I am one of the firm of Kennett and Eaton The prisoner s son was in our employ—he took this shop in Lamb-street and the father was merely there till his son could let it again—the father was more than twelve months in our employ—a more honest man never lived but he had no knowledge of the business Elizabeth Hammond the wife of a sawyer and Daniel Forbes a journeyman weaver gave Harwood a good character HARWOOD— GUILTY Aged 13 — Transported for Seven Years to the Isle of Wight

Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Was the money marked by Christmas marked the same as you and Rutt marked it A No quite different—the shilling which was found afterwards by the policeman had been marked by myself—the shilling found on Pugh was marked by myself on the Saturday and put into the till with the rest—it was marked the same as the rest—there were a great many marked the same way—I can identify this shilling as one I marked— produced by Rutt MR CLARKSON Q Do you know that shilling A Yes it is one I marked by myself—it was found on Pugh with 3s which were marked by Christmas JOHN KERSEY police-constable K 112 Last Tuesday evening I was called to Mr Sinclair s house—I went into the cellar and saw two half-crowns and one shilling—I marked them and left them and locked myself in the wine-cellar about half-past nine o clock—I placed the money between the rafters of the beer-cellar—the wine-cellar has five holes in the doors through which I could see into the beer-cellar—I looked through those holes and in about a quarter of an hour saw Mayfield come down do something to the beer and go away—he came again about eleven o clock went to the rafters where I had seen the two half-crowns and the shilling put his hands up as if putting something there and went away again—he did not return again that night—I remained all night locked in the wine-cellar—he came next morning about eight o clock and went and looked at the money but took nothing away—I then went out of the wine-cellar and found the money still remaining—he returned three times in the course of the day—I remained one whole day and two whole nights in the cellar and on Thursday morning about seven o clock he came went round the cellar put his hand up to where the money was and his other hand up also as if taking it down—I came out went up to the place saw the money was all gone I went up found the prisoner in the kitchen and said to him I want one sovereign two half-crowns and 4s which you have brought out of the cellar as that was the last amount I had seen in the cellar —he paused and said nothing—I then said I do not wish you to say any thing or make any observation unless you think proper —he said after a short time Well the money is my own —I said If it is you have no reason to be ashamed of it —he put his hand into his pocket and drew out one sovereign two half-crowns and four shillings which I could see by the marks was the same I had seen on the rafter—I had marked it all myself after they were put there and there are other marks besides—I produce the money—here is one of the shillings Cross-examined Q You knew nothing about the shillings till you was them on the rafter A Certainly not DUNCAN SINCLAIR re-examined I marked all these shillings and put them in the till—I marked 6l in all in a similar way on various occasions—I cannot tell when I marked this shilling—I cannot distinguish it from others of the 6l worth which I marked—part of them I placed in the till and part my wife—I will swear every one of the 6l worth was put into the till—my wife put some in but I gave them to her and saw her put them in—I gave some to her not to create suspicion—I have three or four tills—we put some in each—I marked money on Thursday Saturday and Tuesday—change must be given from those tills to customers—the last money was marked on Tuesday—the policeman left the cellar on the Thursday morning when he detected him—a whole week had elapsed since the first marking—I will swear I put the mark on this shilling—Christmas did not mark any that was found—I have no partner

of them—the prisoner had the opportunity of taking them Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q When did you ever see them before this charge A I can swear to having seen them about four months ago—I have my window cleaned out every now and then and I put up these myself—I missed them about four months ago—my youngest son is authorized to sell on my account—he is not here Q Do you mean that you saw these taps in the window or some of the same description A I believe I saw these—I cannot say How many I have in my warehouse—I may have 200 but not in the window—those that are wrapped up in paper are kept in my counting-house—there are six or eight dozen perhaps—the prisoner had access to my counting-house—the rest of these taps were in the window in the rack—my son Edwin had access to them but he was not to sell any—the whole of these were in my window four months ago—there were more with them—there might be 100 perhaps—I know these six were in the window because I put them in myself and never sold them—I did not count How many I put in—I only fill up the racks—I did that last about a month ago—I never count them—I should think about 100 will fill the racks Q Three months ago can you tell whether there were one hundred or one hundred and fifty A I have said repeatedly I do not know How many the window will hold—I missed some seeing there was a deficiency in the rack and I mentioned in the shop that I had been robbed again—I cannot say whether there was a deficiency of six only—I did not count them—there was a deficiency—I perceived there had been some taken away—I knew there were six taken if not more Q In the last twelve months How many of these have gone out of your shop by sale A I should think there must have been at least twelve dozen—I know that there were a great many more taken in a clandestine manner—I can positively say these six are not part of the twelve dozen sold—I never sold six of these various kinds mixed together in my life—I have sold numbers of cocks of each kind—we sell them in half-dozens or dozens papered up together MR CLARKSON Q You mentioned in the shop that you had been robbed again A Yes—I communicated that to the prisoner among others—he promised to use his exertions to find out the thief and I mentioned to him that I really began to be suspicious of his fidelity—he did not tell me that he had given any to Mrs Stroud—some of these are a ball-cock pattern—here is one with a screw bottom—we do not often sell this sort except in Yorkshire where we send a great many—these are all new and of four different patterns—I never sold any to the prisoner nor gave him any—I never authorized him to take any or knew that he had done so ELIZABETH STROUD I am a widow I did keep a shop in Grafton-street Soho and I sold eggs—I saw

committed—they are the same I received from the prisoner—I saw Wm Westbrook six weeks ago in Grafton-street—I did not deliver the parcel to him because I did not see him at my house Cross-examined Q You kept an egg shop A Yes—I gave it up about seven weeks ago—William Westbrook never lodged with me—I knew both the Westbrooks as neighbours—William Westbrook was then in prison for debt—I had been two or three times to see him and sent him some eggs over—I had never seen Fuller before—I did not ask him what was in the parcel—I sent word to William Westbrook by his brother that there was a parcel left for him—they were wrapped in brown paper—when I left I took them to where I moved my things to Kensington to my cousin s but I never undid them—they were in a box with other things—I never moved them till I heard of this—I took them away in a brown paper parcel as they were—but they were coming through the old paper and I put them into this other paper—they had never been out of my possession till I gave them to the policeman—I do not know that I had moved them at all unless it was to put the baskets up—I observed the paper was worn out when I was packing up to go to Kensington and put them in another paper that they should not be scattered about—I have not had any conversation with any body about this case—I came to give evidence yesterday—I went to Bow-street because I heard that Mr Pontifex had been robbed and knowing that I had such things in my possession for William Westbrook I went—I had never seen the prisoner to my knowledge before he left the parcel—we had no conversation—he came into the shop and asked to leave them—I knew him again directly I saw him—I pointed him out amongst the persons who were there HENRY BERESFORD I am a police Inspector I produce

said Are you the brother of Thomas Colegate —he said Yes —I asked him where he resided—he said At No 3 Shaftsbury-place Aldersgate-street —I said My information is that you live in Devonshire-street and are carrying ona business there —he said No it was my brother s business—I have been carrying it on but have left him this week past —he said nothing about having any books about him but I found these books on searching him—he did not say that he had brought any bundle there that morning—I found no cord of this description at Devonshire-street Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Did you go to the house in Devonshire-street A Yes—there were a few invoices found there but not relating to any of these goods MR CLARKSON Q Were there any books found in Devonshire-street A Yes a ledger and a day-book—Mr Angell has examined the ledger JOSEPH HOUGHTON On the 4th of June Withers Colegate called on me as he was going by as was his usual practice—I knew he was managing a business for his brother but I did not know where—I knew his brother was in the service of Messrs Hodgson and Co as a warehouseman—I told Withers Colegate that I was about going off to buy some cord of my draper—he said My brother Thomas sells cord you may as well have it of him —I said Oh does he —I told him I should not want it for two days or so and to enquire of his brother what price it would be—he called on the following morning and told me I had better see his brother and I went to Mr Hodgson s warehouse and saw Thomas Colegate there—I took him a pattern of some cord and asked what he would do me the same sort of cord at—he told me from 20d to 22d —that he had not any just then but he would let me have it in the course of the morrow if possible—it did not come the next day and I sent my lad with a note to say that if it was not convenient to let me have it by five o clock that afternoon I must buy some as I wanted it—he sent word back that I should have it about three o clock in the afternoon and it came by Court Mr Hodgson s porter—I asked Court for an invoice of it—he told me he had none—I asked if he knew the price—he said he did not—I had no invoice—I paid for it in the way of trade as I have done for the other things—Withers Colegate called on me the morning after I had it—that was on the 6th or the 7th—I cannot exactly say the day—I asked him if he had brought me a bill of the cord—he said no his brother Thomas could not let me have it under 2s —I said I did not much object to that as it was a good one and I could not get it cheaper of my draper—I told him to tell his brother to make me out a bill—on the 12th of July Withers came to my house before the officers came—he said he wanted to leave a few things which were afterwards delivered to the officer JAMES STEVENS I am one of the prosecutor s porters On the 7th of June Thomas Colegate desired me to cut him thirty yards of cord—he told me the price of the piece and where it laid—I went there and cut it off—he told me I must take it or send it to Mr Houghton a tailor in Jewin-street and I told Court it was to go—I have told my master of this since—I had a suspicion at the time that it was out of the course of business and not entered Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Why did not you tell your master A Because I wished to be more certain—I did not know whether it was right or wrong—I thought it was irregular because all the people were at dinner but me and Court—I do not recollect that he told me at the time to remind him to make an entry of it—he asked me to give him the number and I gave it him and the length and price MR CLARKSON Q Was there plenty of opportunity for him himself to make an entry of it A Certainly there was GEORGE COURT Thomas Colegate gave me the cord and told me to take it to Mr Hough ton s No 3 Jewin-street—I delivered it—he did not give me a bill—as I was returning from delivering the cord I met Thomas Colgate in the Old Change—I said Mr Houghton wanted an invoice —he said he would see him and make all right Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Was it not your duty to mark a book to shew that you delivered the goods A I looked for its being entered in the book and could not see it—I spoke to my fellow-servant about it—I did not speak to my master JOHN ANGELL I am a warehouseman to the prosecutor s They deal in articles of corduroy like this—they have always a stock on hand—I have examined the books for the purpose of seeing whether there is any sale to any person of this cord—a part of it was cut off for a customer named Wakefield and that is entered—the remainder I cannot find entered on our books at all—I have examined the books found on Withers Colegate—there is no entry in them of the purchase of any goods of any body—there were three books found at Devonshire-street—they do not contain any entry of purchases but are all sales RICHARD HODGSON re-examined I think these books are not Thomas Colgate s writing—there may be some lines of his writing but the generality is not his—this ledger is partly in his writing and partly not—this day-book has some of his writing in it—I have looked through the bills of parcels which were found in Devonshire-street—there are no goods in our line of business bought since December—nineteen out of twenty of the things found in that place bore our mark and I could trace no connexion between any of the goods found there and any of the invoices except two small remnants of print SAMUEL EMSLEY I know the prisoner Thomas Colegate by seeing him at Mr Hodgson s—I have heard him called Thomas but I

then proceeded to Monmouth-street where Thompson left us and said she would go and sell the sheet—Mrs Andrews held the sheet while Thompson went to sell the China and then gave it to her to sell—I walked on with Mrs Andrews and then said to her How came you to send for me yesterday to make away with these things when you knew they were stolen —she said Oh don t bother you shall not be hurt —I

you get your living A A man I have lived with many years supports me—he is a machine ruler—it was not Thompson that wished to leave the crockery with me it was Andrews—Thompson did not say she did not

MESSRS CLARKSON and ESPINASSE conducted the Prosecution JAMES HAXELL I am nephew of John Nelson who keeps the Bull Inn at Aldgate The prisoner was in his service in August last—he was employed to drive a van with horse provender to different stables for our horses—on Sunday morning the 18th of August a van was loaded with thirty-two sacks of mixed oats and chaff and one sack of bran—they were to be delivered at Staines—I counted the sacks myself on the Sunday night—the van was covered with a tarpaulin which was tied down behind before and on both sides—it was left in our yard in care of the private watchman—the next morning I went in the direction of Staines and saw the van stopping at the Coach and Horses public-house at Turnham Green-the prisoner was the driver—he did not see me—I stopped opposite where the van stood in a market-garden but I did not see anything done—I was away at the time from an accident—when I came back I saw the van again and the fore-part of the tarpaulin was untied and turned back—the van then went on and when it got just through Bedfont the prisoner stopped the van in the road undid the tilt again and appeared to be doing something to the sacks—then he walked round and tied the tarpaulin again—I was about 200 yards from him but he was not in a situation to see me—I followed the van on to Staines and he went into the private yard of Mr Nelson—John Turner is the horse-keeper there—the van was placed in front of the stable which the loft is over—the tarpaulin was then tied completely all round the van—it was then unloaded—the prisoner got into the van gave the sacks out and Turner carried them to the loft—the prisoner gave out first a sack of bran then seventeen sacks of the oats and chaff one after another—the contents were shot out and the empty sacks left at my feet—at that time the horn of the Defiance coach blew and Turner went out to get the fresh horses for it—I then counted the sacks and there were seventeen—I locked the loft and put the key into my pocket—I went to the coach to inspect the way-bill—the prisoner and a boy who was there came to the coach to assist—they went down the yard again—I followed them—the prisoner then got on the front of the van and took out two empty sacks gave them to the boy and told him to take them up and put them with the other empty sacks and I thought the prisoner said The governor is down we shall get in a mess —the boy could not get into the loft as I had the key and he came back—I ran and caught him with the sacks—he began to cry and said Mr Martin gave them to me —the prisoner heard that and said he knew nothing about it—I said I could tell him all about it that he had left two sacks at Turnham Green and we had suspected him some time—he began to cry and said he never did so before—he begged and prayed of me to forgive him and said he should hang himself or drown himself—I said I would speak to my uncle but it was impossible he should stop in our employ—he said he did not do it it was Jacob—I counted the sacks which were then in the van and there were only thirteen—I told him to go home as fast as he could by the way of Oxford-street and I would go back to Turnham Green and have the ostler taken up—when I had gone back about a mile with the prisoner he blustered at me and said he would have me before my betters for taking his character away—I then gave him into custody Cross-examined by MR JONES Q I believe he has lived with your uncle for sixteen years A I believe so—he has been as long as I can remember—I saw the van with the corn in it on Sunday night about half-past ten o clock—I counted every sack—the gates of the yard were shut at ten o clock at night and opened at five o clock in the morning when the prisoner came THOMAS WARNER I am private watchman to Mr Nelson of the Bull lnn On the Sunday night in question the van was in the yard covered over with a tarpaulin which was tied with cords—I was there on duty from eight o clock in the evening till five o clock in the morning when the prisoner came and took the van—no one had been near it till he came—nothing could have been taken out of it Prisoner s Defence I have always taken the regular complement of corn down to Staines—we always stopped to breakfast at Turnham Green—I never had the conscience to do such a thing—what Mr Haxell has said is very false—he had his brother-in-law in the public-house sitting at the tap-room window—I did not take two empty sacks off—one sack went down by the Defiance full of corn and the empty sack was lying at the stable-door which Turner could

the goods of John Warner and others his masters and GODFREY PHILLIPS for felniously receiving the same well knowing it to have been stolen against the Statute &c MESSRS BODKIN and CHAMBERS conducted the Prosecution RICHARD WARD I am warehouseman in the service of Messrs Warner On the 19th of August I went to the house of the prisoner Phillips and saw three bags of metal on the floor—I think one of them and a basket was emptied on the floor before me—amongst the articles I found this screw belonging to the hose of a fire-engine this large brass cock and this small brass cock—I can swear this screw and this large brass cock belong to Messrs Warner—I think I saw them in their counting-house about three weeks before I found them—they were passed down to the old metal warehouse where Pickering was employed DENNIS POWER police-sergeant H 18 I was on duty in Well-street on the 17th of August and saw the cab draw up in which Pickering was—I saw him get out and found a basket of metal in the cab—I know the house occupied by Phillips—the business of marine stores is carried on there—the house was closed that day being his Sabbath—the windows were open—when the cab stopped Phillips came to the door of his house while Pickering was in the act of getting out of the cab—I then took Pickering into custody—I said to Phillips Are you in the habit of buying brass of this man —he said No I never bought any thing of him Pickering immediately replied Yes you have —Phillips then said Yes about six months ago I did I only bought once —I then asked Phillips if he knew Pickering—he said no he did not—I took Pickering to the station-house and left Conway in charge of Phillips s house—after I left Pickering at the station-house I returned to Phillips s house and found him there—he said he had only bought brass from Pickering once and of that he had made an entry in his book about six months ago—I demanded to see the book and he produced it himself—this is it—he said There is only one entry in the book —he opened it and presented it to me where the entry was—I cannot be confident whether it was the entry of the 7th of March or the 2nd of May that he showed me but I believe it was the 7th of March—on that day here is Bought of Mr Pickering 2qrs of pot—metal at 5d per lb 1l 3s 4d —I examined the book and found nine other entries in it—the first entry was on the 23rd of October 1838 Bought of Mr Pickering 2qrs 8lbs of pot-metal 1l 9s 4d on finding that I said to Phillips He has been here before —he said he was not aware of that—I looked further and found another entry on the 27th of November—I pointed that out to him and his son who was sitting along tide of him at the table nudged his elbow—I pointed out the other entries and then he said he was not aware he had been there so often—the last entry was on the 2nd of May—I went to Messrs Warner s in Jewincrescent—I was gone an hour and a half or two hours—I had left no one at Phillips s premises—I went back accompanied by Mr Bass—I found Phillips at home—I had before I went away noticed a basket in his frontshop similar to the one I took in the cab—I directed Mr Bass to look at the contents of that basket which I put out on the floor—be identified it it as Messrs Warner s property—I then found another basket in the same front shop with a quantity of yellow brass in it—I produced that to Mr Bass and he said That is ours pointing to some articles in it—I then told Phillips to consider himself in custody—I then went into a back ware-house and found six baskets there—they did not contain any thing but they were the same sort of baskets as the other and were identified by Mr Bass—I went into another warehouse and found five other baskets—I said to Phillips Are these all the baskets you have got —he said Yes these are all I had from Pickering —I then took him to the station-house and left an officer in charge of the shop—I went there again on the Monday after with Mr Ward and found other metal which he claimed—I took the two prisoners in a hackney-coach to the office and in going along Phillips addressed himself to Pickering and said he had told him he was recommended by some person in the employ of Messrs Glascott—Pickering said he did not—Phillips then said I paid you 6d a piece for each of the baskets besides paying you for the brass —Pickering said he did not—Phillips repeated the words I did pay you 6d for each of them —Pickering shook his head—these are the baskets and the metal which I found there Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How long have you been in the H division of the police force A About three years since I joined it last—I was not out of the police force before I joined the letter H last more than six weeks—it might be three years from the time I was in the H division before till I rejoined it again—I have now been to the division three years and I was three years away from that division Q When did you first join the police force A Ten years on the first of February next—I then went into the H division—I might stay in it for four years I cannot speak positively—I then changed to the K division—there might be an interval between my leaving the H division and joining the K but I was not out of the police force—I might be two years in the K division I am not certain—I cannot positively say in what year I left the K division—I was not aware that such a question would be put—it has escaped my memory—it might be two years and a half—I then resigned out of the K division—when I left it was recorded as a resignation Q Do you mean to repeat that you resigned or that it was recorded you resigned A The commissioners of police allowed me to resign out of the force and I resigned as a matter of course Q Before you were allowed to resign were you told by the commissioners that you were a dangerous character and should not be trusted any longer with the high honour of a police constable and you were dismissed from the force A I do not recollect it—if such language fell from any commissioner I do not recollect it—my character is good as good as that of any adventurer who ever left Ireland Q Have you ever worn large bushy whiskers A Yes I used—they remained on till a very recent period—I cannot tell when I shaved them of—I shave every day Q Then why did you fix on any recent period at which you shaved them off A Because it was an order from the commissioners of police that every man was to shave his whiskers off and make them in rather a more military style that was why I cut them off Q Do you ever read the Weekly Dispatch newspaper A I do not think any thing of it—I do read it occasionally—I read the account in it of my own affair before the commissioners and a more gross falsehood was never published—I wrote to the editor of the Dispatch and was about to enter an action against him Q Why did you not A Perhaps I had not the means to do it—the editor was willing to make any apology as my friend told me—I never heard Colonel Rowan say that I was a dangerous character—I will not swear he did not say it in my presence—I made a charge which was a good one—I have got a witness to prove that my charge was a good one Q Did not Colonel Rowan tell you you had made a foul and false charge against a brother officer A It would be impossible for me to recollect every thing that passed—whether he repeated that language or not I am not prepared to say—this was after an examination that lasted five days—I was dismissed the force Q You said you resigned A I was kept on nine days after and was allowed to resign—I have got good interest and I employed my friend to interfere for me to join the police again Q Did the commissioners after that five days examination tell you you were no longer worthy of a place in that or any other honourable corps A I will not swear it was not said Q Were you ever told you were not worthy to be believed on your oath A It might be said but I do not recollect it—I have been at Lambeth-street many times—I was never told by the Magistrates of Lambeth-street that I was not fit to be believed on my oath—it is easy for you to get a parcel of Jews to say things against me—I have been offered money in abundance to settle this case—300l I have been offered Q Will you swear positively that you were not told by the Magistrates at Lambeth-street that you were not fit to be believed on your oath A I swear I never heard it in my life—I will swear I never heard it and if it was said within a yard of me I must have heard it Q Were you at all interested in any affair with a young woman and a ladder A Never sir Q Were you ever concerned in any transaction with the daughter of a widow by means of a ladder A Never sir—I never used a ladder in my life—I was never charged with having seduced a widow s daughter—there was a complaint made against me for keeping company with a person but I do not think that was a widow s daughter—her father was dead but her mother was married a second time—I should think the age of the gird was twenty—I will not swear it—I never inquired her age in my life—that was while I was in the H division—her mother made the complaint—I dare say it is six years ago Q When you left the K division had you been a sergeant A Yes and when I was out of the force I set my friend s interest at work and got in again but not as a sergeant—it is an order of the Secretary of State that you cannot join as sergeant—I went into the ranks—I cannot speak to the time I continued in the ranks—I dare say it was two years—I am almost sure it was—I will not swear it was eighteen months—it was more than twelve months—the complaint the woman made against me was for keeping company with her daughter nothing else—she did not complain of my seducing her daughter in my presence—I cannot tell whether she used that word in my presence Q You were exchanged from H to K A Yes through a person of the name of Brown a hair-dresser in Whitechapel who frequented the Garrick tavern—I was bringing a prisoner along one night and I said he was no better than one of the swell mob—I do not know whether that was a gentleman of the name of Stebbings residing at Ratcliffe—I do not recollect his name at all—Brown was the man who came up and made the complaint and Colonel Rowan told me then to join any division in the police I liked and I joined the K—he asked Mr Hunter a gentleman who is now deceased Can t you remove Power to another division so that he may be away from these people that have complained —the reason I was removed was that I should not have any words with this person—he said You can join any division you think proper and I chose the K—I recollect Colonel Rowan telling me to join any division I thought proper in the force Q After turning you out A He did not turn me out—he permitted me to remain in it till there was a vacancy in the K division Q What became of the complaint against you by the widow A She went to the superintendent and told him about it—there was an inquiry about it and it was found I did not do what was represented in taking the girl out—I never did take her out—I never walked two yards from the door with her in my life Q Then that was explained to the satisfaction of the superintendent A I believe his answer to me was that it was improper in me to go there and he required me to go there no more—he never made use of the word that he would have me discharged—he said he would brine me before the commissioners if I did not give over going to this place—I was never complained of by any other gentleman for abuse and ill-treatment except Brown to my knowledge Q Will you swear you were not charged with having abused and ill-used Mr Brown A He made a complaint I tell you but a charge is a very different thing—I should call it a charge when a person makes a complaint and signs the sheet Q Will you tell us whether there was not a complaint or a charge made at some other person s instance A There might be a good many charges which were unfounded and which I rebutted to the satisfaction of a good many—I was never here when a person was charged with stealing a pewter pot—I never had a pewter-pot case in my life to my knowledge Q Did you ever tell a witness who came here to contradict you that he had better top his boom and be off A I never made use of the word—I never recollect any such thing Q Was it in a case of a pewter measure A I do not know that I never had a charge of that description in my life that I know of—I believe I had a glass stealing case—that was I believe the only charge I have ever had of that nature Q Did you ever tell any man who came as a witness on the part of the prisoner in any case in which you were a witness on the part of the prosecution that he had better top his boom and be off A I never recollect using such language in my life—I have no recollection of it—perhaps you will get parties to swear it Q Will you swear positively you did not use it A I do not recollect it Q Have you done nothing to meet with the disapprobation of the Magistrates in this case A Not that I know of—I did not receive the disapprobation of the Magistrates that I am aware of—the possession of this house belonging to Phillips was improperly got away from me—it was communicated by a solicitor to my superintendent that it was the order of Mr Broughton to give up the house and I told him so and he said Let it be generally understood in this Court that I never gave such an order —I was ordered to give it up by my superintendent and Mr Broughton said publicly in Court that he never gave any such order and Mr William Heritage said he was—bound to give some explanation for going to the superintendent and Mr Broughton said I suppose it must be a mistake but for that I would have had other charges against Phillips here to-day—I took possession of the keys of the shop—there is another way of going into the house through the passage—I had not the key of the front door—Phillips and his family had free access to the whole of the house without the shop—I took possession of the keys of the two shops without the knowledge of the Magistrate or my superintendent—I was not remonstrated with by the Magistrate for so doing—MR Broughton said The police know what they are doing Q How soon after you got them were you remonstrated with A Some days—I put one man in the place but not without the knowledge of my superior—I said to him Sir I will leave a man here to-night as there is a good deal of property in these two shops and the following morning I went to my superintendent and said I had better leave a man by night and day—the superintendent did not remonstrate with me about keeping the keys till William Heritage came and said I was ordered to give them up Q Did you tell your superintendent that the Magistrate knew you had got the keys A No—my superintendent asked me how the case got on and I told him Q Will you swear you did not tell the superintendent that you were directed by the Magistrate to take the keys A I never recollect any such thing—if they understood it so they must have misunderstood me—I never repeated such words only what I have stated to you—if such language was understood it is certainly wrong—he might understand one thing and not another—when William Heritage came to say that I was to give it up the superintendent said Power I understood from you it was the Magistrate s order —I said No sir it was remanded till Saturday and I thought it necessary to leave a man there —I do not recollect telling the superintendent that I had authority from the Magistrate to take the keys—I will not swear I did not say so—I was never charged with any ill-usage of a female to my knowledge—if I had done any thing wrong to a female I should recollect that Q Were you complained of for doing any thing wrong to a female A Yes—I did not give her any thing to buy her off—the woman is alive I cannot recollect her name for the instant—she can be found—she never made a complaint against me Q Was there no complaint made A Yes it was made by a man I quarrelled with who is a constable now at the Union Saloon beer-shap and can be found—I cannot recollect the name of the woman—she lives at No 8 Friar-mount Bethnal-green—that complaint was investigated Q Did you go to the woman s house A Not before it was investigated—it was on Sunday night the 17th of March—she was passing by Brick-lane with a milk-can in her possession—I went to her house as a matter of course Q Did you give her any money A I did not so help me G—d—there was no money given her to my knowledge—I did not promise her any though 8he asserted afterwards that I did I never did and that was disproved Q Did you go to her house and get a letter from her to take to your superior A No sir—she could not write—I got her signature—I did not carry a letter to her house—it was a statement a few lines—I did not write it—a constable in the force 73 H named Jerome Galvin wrote it at my request—I did not think it was necessary to write it myself—he was sitting there and I said You write this out Q What had you got a copy ready for him A I think I worded it to him—I might have had it written—the statement was written out by this man and I took it in presence of a witness and said Are you satisfied with this —she said Yes — Will you sign this — I can t write I will make my mark Q Who was your witness I went to a respectable inhabitant of Bethnal-green and his statement went to the Commissioners of Police and they were satisfied—he followed me up and said You was very much injured by this person you never made use of this expression —he is a broker in Church-street—his name is Sands—he will come and take his oath that such an expression never fell from my lips—the superintendent asked me did I promise her any money and I said no—and I never saw her only in presence of a respectable witness Q Did the woman come before the superintendent and say that you cajoled her out of the letter under a promise of 5s A I do not know whether she made use of that language—I did not see her Q Before you left the division of the force in which you were did the Lambeth-street Justices tell you that they would not receive your evidence except it was confirmed by another policeman A I never heard them on my oath—I never heard them say so to me in my life to my knowledge—there was no complaint made against me before the Justices on this case Q Were you charged with having got a ready written paper and reading your evidence to the clerk from that A Yes—I had got a written paper in my hand which contained the notes of my evidence on a former occasion Q Who gave it you A I got it at Mr Hunt s office Q Did you get it before you gave your evidence A No—I had given my statement before the Magistrates Q You then went and got a copy and made your deposition from the written statement A No—I had only read about two lines before Mr William Heritage said You are reading your evidence —I said No it is only a note of my evidence —I had only read about two lines—I had two examinations before this and explained the entire of my evidence—the entire of the facts word for word—I was then ordered by Mr Hunt to go to him who said he wished to get the evidence—I went to his office and he took down our evidence—at least his clerk did Q Did the attorney Mr Hunt know that you were going to take that to the Magistrate and read your deposition from it when he gave it you A No—I asked his clerk for it—I do not think he knew I had it—I asked for it to refresh my memory and that was the paper from which I was reading whilst the clerk had begun to write my deposition MR BODKIN Q Were those circumstances in the paper related when the Dispatch newspaper was attacking the police force every Sunday A They were and more than that I know the individual who employed the reporter to put that article in the Dispatch —I have been in the force without any complaint being made against me since that female s which in some months ago—I never gave her any money nor promised her any—between twelve and one o clock at night on the 17th of March I saw this woman coming up rather shabbily dressed with a new milk can in her hand—I said Where did you get it —she said It is my own —I said Where do you reside —she said At Friars Mount Bethnal-green —a constable was by and heard her—I called him and said Go with this woman to her residence and see if her story is correct —a person who was tending by said What business have you to call this woman a beast —that was the charge made against me—Col Rowan and Mr Mayne are both aware of my being now in the force and being sergeant in it MICHAEL CONWAY I am a police-officer I was with Power when he took Pickering into custody—Pickering was in a cab—I saw it stop at Phillips s door—there was a basket in the cab—I saw Phillips come to the door and Power asked him if he knew Pickering—he said No —Pickering said Yes you do and then Phillips said he had seen him once about six months ago—Power then told Pickering he was his prisoner—he put him into the cab and took him to the station-house—he asked Phillips if he was in the habit of buying brass from the prisoner—Phillips said No —Pickering said Yes you have —Phillips then said Yes once about six months ago Power then told Pickering he was his prisoner and he put him into the cab and took him—I was in Phillips s house till Power came back—on his coming back he asked Phillips if the prisoner was known to him—Phillips said No but that he bought some brass of him on one occasion about six months ago—he did not say any tiling else on that occasion—he produced a book and said he bought brass of him once about six months ago and he would read him the entry of it from the book—Sergeant Power demanded to see the book and he pointed out ten entries and showed them to Phillips who said he did not think there were so many—after that Power and I went away for some time—I returned there about half-past ten o clock with Mr Bass who pointed out the baskets—Power then gave Phillips into my custody—Power and Mr Bass went to search the back premises—while they were doing that Phillips said to me that he paid Pickering 6d a piece for the baskets beside when he paid for the brass—I remained in the house till the following morning Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q When did you see your depositions last A When they were read to me at Worship-street this day three weeks—I have not seen them since and there has been nothing read out to me since I am sure—Power asked Phillips if he knew Pickering-Phillips answered No and then he said he had seen him on one occasion about six months ago Q Upon your oath did you breathe one word of that till after you had heard Power s evidence read over before the Magistrate A I did—I was not examined till my deposition was taken COURT Q You say in your deposition I recollect this by hearing the evidence now read over did that apply to your own evidence or to his A It was not to his it was on my own deposition Q Before you stated that had you heard Power s deposition A Yes I had stated this fact before I was reminded of it to persons in the office—I believe I stated it to Mr Hunt—I distinctly recollect it now from my on knowledge JAMES BURT police-constable H 166 On the 19th of August I assisted in bringing the prisoners from the station-house to the office in a coach—as we were going along Phillips said to Pickering that he paid 6d a piece for each basket in addition to paying him for the brass—Pickering said No —Phillips repeated it again and Pickering shook his head and said no more WILLIAM COOPER BASS I am a metal-sorter in the prosecutor s service I went to Phillips house on Saturday night the 17th of August about half-past ten o clock—I saw several baskets in the front shop—I identified them as the property of Messrs Warner—I saw a basket with a quantity of brass in it which I have every reason to believe was the property of Messrs Warner—I then went into the back shop and found some baskets there which were the property of Messrs Warner—I heard Phillips say that they were the baskets in which he had received the metal from the prisoner Pickering Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Was not the expression he made use of that they were baskets in which the metal had been brought A Yes WILLIAM MAYER I am foreman to Mr Sykes a timber-merchant in New Montague-street On a Saturday in August I saw a cab drive up near the house of Phillips the marine-store dealer—I saw Pickering get out of the cab and take out a basket containing metal and the top covered with brown paper—it was a basket like this one a brown twig basket and mended with white—I believe this is the basket—he took it into Phillips s house—I had seen him come there in a cab four or five Saturdays before—he always came in a cab about seven o clock—in consequence of what I observed a communication was made to the police EDWARD ALLEN SKENE I am clerk to Mr Sykes the timber-merchant Four or five Saturdays before the prisoners were taken I had seen a cab come within about 200 yards of Phillips s house and a man get out and convey a basket particularly heavy loaded towards Phillips s house WILLIAM JONES I keep the Jacob s Well public-house which is next door to Phillips s—I know Pickering from seeing him once or twice in my house in company with Phillips—they have been together mostly in the latter part of the day and they drank together—I cannot say whether they came together or on what day of the week they were there ALFRED WARNER The firm consists of John Warner and two others PICKERING— GUILTY Aged 23 — Transported

stating it to be the goods of James Hargrave and others MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM JAMIESON ANSON I am agent for the firm of James Hargrave and Company of Leeds and carry on business in Wood-street Cheapside—there are three partners—I receive property from their factory at Leeds regularly and am responsible to them—the prisoner was my porter for rather more than two years and a half—about the 10th of December I took stock and found myself short about one hundred and twenty yards of woollen cloth called buckskin in consequence of that something passed between me and the prisoner and in consequence of what I heard I discovered some property at the pawnbroker s—I received a duplicate from Mr Nussey in the presence of the prisoner s brother—I have kept it ever since—the prisoner was not present—his brother had given it to Mr Nussey at that interview CHARLES BOND I am shopman to Mr Bartram a pawnbroker in Princes-street Soho I have two yards and a quarter of buokskin pawned on the 6th of May in the name of John Freer—I took it in and the duplicate was written by the boy—I do not know who pledged it—I have no belief on the subject—it was a man—the prisoner has often pawned at our shop and always in the name of John Freer—I have some other property pawned on the 20th of May about the same quantity in the same name—I cannot say whether it was pawned by the same person—the prisoner has pawned many things similar to this buckskin and cloth—I know him by sight but do not know whether he pawned these articles or not—he has pledged buckskin on every occasion that he came—the duplicate of the pledge on the 6th of May is in the hand-writing of a person in our shop—it was affixed to the property I have produced—the one produced by Mr Anson corresponds with it and is the ticket which would be given to the person pawning on the 6th of May STEPHEN DALY I am the prisoner s brother—I am a tailor and live in Dorset-place Pall Mall East My brother gave me this ticket and I gave it to Mr Nussey on the Thursday night that be was charged—I received it from my brother at the latter end of May or beginning of June—he wished me to take care of it—it was a duplicate similar to this—I cannot say this is the same—I have rather a doubt of it—I did not look particularly at the ticket I gave Mr Nussey and cannot say whether this is the ticket or not—I had it until December—I did not see Mr Nussey hand it over to Mr Anson Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Where was Mr Nussey when you gave him the ticket A At my lodgings—the prisoner was present at the time no one else—I kept the ticket in a box belonging to myself—there were six or seven other duplicates there—I am not sure I gave Mr Nussey the same ticket I received from my brother in May MR PAYNE Q Did

to me a few minutes after he had received the keys of the warehouse and asked if I locked it over night—I said Yes —he said Well the warehouse-door is open and half-a-pile of superfine blacks is gone —I immediately went to the warehouse and found it was quite dark the shutters not being down and 1 could not myself have discovered that the pile was so much reduced—I have not found any of the property lost that night—he has given no information of the property mentioned in the placard Q Why have the man taken into custody after he had given you the account of the things but given you no

locked in—my wife opened the window and called Police —I missed the keys from off the mantle-piece—the policeman got in at the front window came up stairs and let me out—I went down and found the

some female said Yes and they went down into the kitchen—I dared not to say any thing till all was quiet and then I gave an alarm to the landlord Prisoner Q Did you see me or hear me go out of the house A I heard some person go out of your room and some person go up and down stairs and some person speak to a man—I gave the alarm about half-past four o clock JURY Q Did you hear the street-door

I know I have—I am going to fetch my mistress home —I said What have you got under your arm —she said My young mistress s cloak her dress her snow-boots and soled boots the story was so

was a brown silk purse—I found in it three duplicates of some of this property which was pawned Prisoner I never saw the silver spoons On Christmas morning Saidler was not timid at letting four men in at her window and I wonder she should be timid at letting Mr Soulby know HARRIET SAIDLER re-examined I did not—I never had but one gentleman to see me and that was my friend Prisoner s Defence I know nothing of the property—I had nothing on me nor in my possession—I cast myself on the mercy of the Court—it is ray misfortune that the first situation I got in England proved to be a brothel—Saidler

sample of this particular sort of wool—this is called an average sample but one average sample was drawn of this mark and that sample was sent to Lord and Hall—this other paper is marked with our mark—some of that was supplied to Lord and Hall and others have had the same but the average sample was sent to them and no one else—there is in this bag wool which answers to the class of wool that was in one of these papers Cross-examined Q Can you tell how long ago any of these went to Lord and Hall A This average sample was delivered on the 9th or 10th of January and this other-sample-paper went about the same date—I gave orders for the average sample to be drawn but I was not present when it was delivered—this part of the wool to the best of my knowledge is what was in the average

t18400511-1409  1409 JOHN CROOKS and SAMUEL WHIFFEN were indicted for stealing on the 10th of April 16 bushels of oats value 2l 10s and 4 sacks value 8s the goods of John Johnson their master WILLIAM JOHNSON I am the son of John Johnson a corn-dealer in William-street Knightsbridge—he has a granary there—he does business in Thames-street—Crooks was in his service for three or four years and Whiffen one year—they were carmen—they came at five o clock in the morning—it was the custom to give orders to Crooks in the evening—I was present on the 9th of April when my father gave him directions—there had been corn lost from the granary—I stationed myself on the 10th of April in the morning in the lower granary—the corn was in the granary over my head—the prisoners both came about four o clock—I was at the back of the hay concealed—I could not see them come in but I heard some one and knew Crooks by a particular cough that he had—I then heard them go up stairs to an upper floor—I got on the top of the hay and heard them up stairs for nearly a quarter of an hour—I heard them scuffling and stamping and as I imagined dragging the sacks along the floor—I then saw Crooks come down the ladder and go out into the yard—the sacks are lowered from the upper floor out of the window by the hands—I saw four sacks descend one after the other—I could not see who put them down but I saw Crooks receive them take them on his shoulder and pitch them down in a cart—Whiffen then came down the ladder very cautiously indeed and went out into the yard and shut the granary door after him—I waited a little and then went and spoke with my father—he got up and came down—I went out into the street to stay a good way off as I intended to follow the cart and then I heard a noise of a cart and thought they were gone—when I got out I met a policeman—I sent him to the yard—soon after that I saw my father and saw Crooks running away across the road—the policeman followed him—Whiffen was there and my father held his collar—I then came into the road where the cart stood—I examined it—there were four sacks in it full of oats laid n the bottom carefully covered with the tarpaulin Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Used not Crooks to take oats to different customers A Yes not generally in my absence—I am generally there—his work is generally at Thames-street—I will not swear that he has not been in the habit of taking them to different customers from Knightsbridge—I make a distinction between our place and Thames-street because latterly he had not done business from our place—he might have done it a month previously—he has frequently taken the customers corn and when he has delivered it he has come home and accounted daily for the money when he has received it—we have stables in William s-mews—there was only one horse there—there was not a horse of my brother Henry s there—there never were two in the cart—there was an alteration making in Thames-street—I never saw my father strike either of the prisoners—he did not almost beat Crooks to death in my presence—I did not strike them—I was there when my lather had old Tom called in and he said he knew nothing at all about it—my father after that discharged him—I called in a policeman—my father knew it—he did not send me for him—I considered Tom perhaps to be as guilty as the others—I had proof of it in my mind because he always accompanied Crooks to the wharf and he might have known something about it—I was often with them—I believe a sewer was up in Thames-street—Williams-mews is not near Thames-street—I do not recollect hearing my father ordering Crooks to be there earlier than usual because Thames-street was under repair—I was present when he gave the orders—he might have said Make haste in the morning —he might have given him orders to be there earlier than usual—I do not recollect that he did Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Was Whiffen in the habit of going with the cart A Yes he was not in the habit of going with Crooks—he might have gone with him but not generally—he did not go with him as often as once a week—Crooks was to have gone with old Tom—it was not Whiffen s duty to be at the stable when the cart was going early in the morning—he ought to be there when the men came—Tom was not there that morning with them—we have a customer named Smithers and Crooks was to go to the Wheat Sheaf wharf to get a load for them—he would have to go through Thames-street and if the road was up it would have to go round—I was not present from the time my father came down stairs till the men were given into custody—I went out in the road some distance off—I remained there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—it was my intention to follow the cart—I did not stop the cart—I do not know that my father beat Whiffen—I saw him when he was in custody—he did not appear to have been beaten—both me and my father were here yesterday in the yard—neither of us said to my knowledge I have nothing against Whiffen I believe him to be an honest man —I might have said I believed him to be an honest man previous to that charge—a person spoke to my father about being merciful—my father said I am here if I go away I should forfeit my recognizances —neither of us said If it were not for forfeiting our recognizances we would not appear against Whiffen believing him to be innocent MR BODKIN Q Do you know the person that came up to you A No but I believe he is come to give one of the prisoners a good character—the orders were given to Crooks on paper—I saw my father write them—no part of it was that Crooks was to take corn from the stable that morning JOHN JOHNSON I am the prosecutor—the prisoners were in my employ On the 9th of April I gave Crooks some directions on paper what he was to do the next morning—this is the order— looking at a paper — reads — Mr Richardson Please receive ten quarters of foreign oats and ten of Scotch oats He and old Tom had to go to a wharf to load these oats—Whiffen had no business to attend Crooks that morning—his duty was to cart corn in our neighbourhood—he had a horse and cart for that purpose quite distinct from Crooks—it was kept in the yard at Knightsbridge and Crooks s were kept in Williams s mews—neither of them had any direction to take any corn from my premises the next morning—Crooks would have to take sacks—on the morning of the 10th I was awoke by my son—he told me something and I came down—I went into the yard when I found Crooks had got his horse from Williams s mews and placed it in the cart—he was about to go out of the yard and Whiffen was standing there doing nothing—the gates were open—my son was with me—he did not go into the yard—I let him out at my private door—I said to Crooks I think I am up a little before my time but I see you are going to start earlier as it was my wish —he said Yes but I have not got my sacks —I said You had better put them in —he then put in about twenty empty sacks—I had observed nothing in the cart at that time—he did not tell me he bad anything—he then shuffled about and said Oh master I have lost my notice I have lost my order —he drew his cart out into the middle of the road while I went as he supposed to write fresh orders—with that a policeman came up and spoke to me—I seized Whiffin and told the policeman to seize Crooks—Crooks immediately dropped his whip and ran as fast as he could up a court and over the park wall and the policeman after him—he returned in about a quarter of an hour bringing Crooks back in custody—during that time I kept Whiffen—I searched the cart and four sacks of oats were found in it covered over very carefully with a tarpaulin—they were worth from 50s to 3l —I had not desired Crooks to start earlier than usual that morning—we wished him to start about half-past five o clock—neither of the prisoners would have authority to take that quantity of oats from my granary—the first thing they had to do was to deliver twenty quarters of corn from Wheat Sheaf wharf Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Is it true that you did not expect them earlier than usual A No—I did not desire them to come earlier than usual—it was a casual remark that I made I see you are come earlier according to my wish —if people wanted corn delivered earlier than usual I endeavoured to get them away half an hour earlier—old Tom is discharged—he was to have gone with Crooks that morning and as I had been robbed I could not but consider that he knew something about where the corn was going—I asked him if he knew where it was to go—he said No and I discharged him—he had been twelve years in my service—I did not tell him whenever I met him in the street I would call out There goes that d——d old rogue —I told him that I had some suspicion that he must know where the corn was taken to—I should think he is sixty-one or sixty-two years old—I sent for a policeman but I made no charge whatever against him to the policeman—it was not to intimidate him into some declaration that I sent for a policeman—I do not recollect whether my son was with me—I do not recollect that I sent my son for a policeman—Crooks very seldom took corn from the granary to the customers—he used to do it—he was never trusted to bring back the money—occasionally when parties paid it on delivery which they seldom did I have trusted him with the bill and receipt where we know the parties pay and he has brought it—I have not five customers that pay on delivery—he may have brought back 5l or 6l at a time Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You had a good opinion of Whiffen A No farther than of any other man—we believe them honest till we find them out—I took him by the collar that was all the violence I used to him—I did not strike him to my knowledge—I swear I did not strike him many times—I do not think I struck him at all—I think I could confidently swear I did not strike him in the face—I do not know that I struck him—I might have pushed very hard against him to prevent his getting away—I will swear I did not strike him more than once—I know a gentleman named Howe—I do not know any thing for him or much against him—I know he had a stable opposite my premises at Knights-bridge and left without paying any body—I do not recollect whether he owed me any thing—he is a man of slight character—I heard that he called his creditors together—I cannot tell who from—it is five years ago—I saw him yesterday—he said he came to plead for mercy for Whiffen—I said I could have nothing to say to it he had robbed me and I had reason to suppose he had been robbing me for a considerable time he had offended the law and must take the consequence—MR Howe said You know me and Mr Smith knows me I am well known in your neighbourhood —I said Very likely —I said I am not going to lose my recognizance but I did not say that I believed Whiffen to be an honest man nor any thing of the kind MR BODKIN Q Had you any reason to believe him to be any thing but an honest man up to this time A No RICHARD BROWN police-constable B 116 I was at the prosecutor s premises on the morning of the 10th of April—I saw Crooks go there about four o clock—I was applied to by young Mr Johnson about five o clock—I went and saw Crooks run away and jump over a wall—I pursued and brought him back—he said he had done wrong and was afraid he should be transported—I took him and Whiffen to the station-house—I found this order in Crooks pocket Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you take Crooks A A man going to work stopped him and I took him Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Are you the officer that took them both to the station-house A I had assistance—I did not talk to Whiffen on the way—I did not hear it said that it would be better for him to tell all about it nor You have made a bad job of it —I did not hear him answer You seem to know a great deal about it Thomas Finch labourer of Devonshire-street Kennington gave Whiffen a good character William Evans a cabinet-maker in Nassau-street Henry Roberts of Great Russell-street and William Titherby a glover gave Crooks a good character CROOKS— GUILTY Aged 26 WHIFFEN—

MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution THOMAS MARSHALL I keep the Parr s Head public-house Islington the prisoner was my pot-boy for about seven months I had reason to complain of his getting tipsy On Sunday the 26th of July when I came home from church I found him in a state of intoxication which induced me to send for a policeman—he was not able to do hit work and I was obliged to get rid of him—on the following morning my niece made a communication to me and I went up to the front attic in which the prisoner slept with another man named Sale—I saw the prisoner s box opened and a canister found which contained two quarts and a pint of gin and a bung was in the top—I believe the canister to be mine it is like one I missed—I also found a penknife and case which were mine and some tobacco—the gin resembles what I had a sample of—I had missed gin—there was a tin measure found which I had never seen before—I do not claim that—the tobacco weighed an ounce and a half—I was present before the Magistrate the first time the prisoner was taken there—he said it was part of the remains of an ounce of tobacco that he had bought at a shop opposite the church and he had smoked some part of it—I had tobacco of the same sort in my house Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q What kind of tobacco is it A Shag—it is quite common—I came home from church a little before one o clock—I did not see the prisoner about eight o clock in the morning he was gone before I came down stairs—I never saw him till I returned from church—I breakfasted about nine o clock—he was lying down drunk at six o clock in the evening—I think he had had part of a pot of beer with some friends—I have no garden—my bar-maid s name is Elizabeth I can not tell her surname—I believe a person was at my house last night inquiring the name of my bar-maid—I cannot tell when she was engaged it is about three months—I cannot tell whether she has ever received any letters Q Do you know where the prisoner was between one and six o clock in the evening A The greater part of the time on the settle asleep—I cannot say how early in the morning he was drunk—my bar was closed if not locked during church time—it is locked up with shutters at night—there are two doors to it which are opened in the day—there are sliding shutters in two grooves they form a passage—the shutters are sixteen or eighteen inches from the ceiling—there is an entrance from the bar-parlour to the bar—I lock the outer door of the bar and take the key up stairs—there were no marks of violence on these shutters or doors—I kept three servants altogether the house-maid and bar-maid—this is the canister it was quite full when I found it—I cannot tell what strength the gin in the canister was—the strong gin we buy is 22 degrees under proof—then we sweeten it—we are not obliged to put the strength of it on the cask Q Is not this gin some degrees beyond the strength you usually sell your gin A It is not below it—I cannot undertake to swear that it is the same strength as any gin I sold that Sunday—we have gin of different strength according to the price—I sell British gin and hollands—we have it at 22 degrees and the cordial gin at 17 degrees—this is the same strength as the cordial gin I sold on that Sunday—I can only go by the taste—I had a man in my house named Sale but he is gone away—he applied to me for a bed and I would not let him sleep there—I do not know whether it was Sunday night or not but he was never in the house afterwards he was not in the house when the prisoner came home drunk—it was most likely after this discovery that I told Sale he should not sleep there—he never slept in the room after Saturday night—I never saw him again till after the prisoner was in custody—I never saw him on the Sunday—I said he should not sleep there because I thought probably there might be something wrong with Sale Q Did you drink out of your stock A I should not suppose I sent out for what I drank—I have not taken account of what I and my family drank MR BODKIN Q But allowing for what you took you have missed gin A Yes—I desired Sale not to come there any more THOMAS WHITHERS police-constable N 211 The prisoner was given to me by the prosecutor for disorderly conduct—I saw the canister and gin found in the box wrapped up in a cloth at Hatton-garden—the prisoner said he had the gin made a present to him three years ago—I saw this case in his box it contained a penknife—there was also a measure—I have seen the same sort of measures used in brickfields to serve out gin SARAH MARSHALL I am the prosecutor s wife—this knife and case are mine— looking at them —I missed them about three months ago—I made very great inquiries about it in the house in the hearing of the prisoner—he gave me no information about it—it was kept in the bar-parlour—I believe this canister to be ours—we had such a one and missed it—I find we are short of the quantity of gin we ought to have—the doors of the bar are locked at night but there is an opportunity for a person getting over the partition to the bar Cross-examined Q The prisoner had no business in the bar A No except to put his pots on the shelf—I cannot say exactly when I saw this canister last—it was not in use—it was kept under the bar-counter with another—it was bought with the furniture of the house when we took it—in the inventory it is put down as an old tin tea-canister—there are no particular marks on it—there are four persons in our family—I do not take a great deal of spirits—I do not take a glass or two a day—I do not know the strength of the gin JOHN SALE I slept in a room with the prisoner—the prosecutor permitted me to do so out of charity—when this affair took place he would not allow me to sleep there any longer

there a fortnight—I never got up with the prisoner in the middle of the night—I never missed him from my side REBECCA BOYCE I am the prosecutor s niece It was part of my business to make the prisoner s bed—the morning after he was taken I went to make his bed and smelt a strong smell of liquor—I went and told my uncle and then saw the things found in his box Cross-examined Q That was the first time you smelt gin A Yes—the box was open and no key in it—Mr Marshall never told me I must swear to that tin canister—he has asked me whether I knew it and I said I did know it by seeing it on the shelf under the counter—I did not recollect at first—I had always made that bed before—we have a barmaid named Elizabeth—I do not know her surname—I was at home that Sunday morning—the prisoner was out the best part of the morning—I cannot say whether the bar was fastened all that time MR BODKIN Q Do you know that man who has been suggesting questions to the Counsel A Yes I saw him last night at my uncle s house insulting the customers MRS MARSHALL My bar-maid told me that a person had been to inquire her name and she would not give it MR BODKIN to T WHITHERS Q Were you present when the prisoner was before the Magistrate A Yes—I heard the prisoner make a statement—I do not think it was taken down in writing—I know Mr Greenwood s signature—this I believe to be his— read — The prisoner

t18401019-2469  2469 THOMAS LARARD alias HOBSON was indicted for stealing on the 6th of January 3 watches value 12l the goods of Thomas Massey his master MR DOANE conducted the Prosecution THOMAS MASSEY I am a watchmaker and live in Birchin-lane The prisoner was my shopman for twelve or fourteen months—in consequence of something that happened at the latter end of September I sent for M Lean the Inspector and gave the prisoner into custody—I afterwards went with him to the prisoner s residence in Collier-street—I think he occupies the house and lets out the first floor—it is a four-roomed house—I saw his tools there—I found forty-seven duplicates and among them three which the inspector took charge of— looking at three watches —these are all my property and were in my possession while the prisoner was in my service—I had not sold nor parted with them—the prisoner had no right to them in any way whatever Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q I believe your brother recommended the prisoner to you A He did—I understand he was in business for himself before he came to me—I cannot exactly say when I had last seen either of the watches—the one produced by King was taken in exchange from a gentleman on the 7th of November last year—I have an entry of it in the book—I cannot tell when I bad last seen it—I have not taken stock for the last eight months—the prisoner continued in my service from the time I took it in exchange FRANCES MC LEAN I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner s residence in Collier-street and found the three duplicates referring to the watches produced JAMES KING I am a pawnbroker in High Holborn—I have a watch No 1001 pawned on the 6th of August—I do not know who by—the young man who took it in has left my service—it it in the name of Charles Ellis 10 Castle-street—the duplicate produced by the officer corresponds with the one on the watch in all respects and is the same hand-writing THOMAS WENTWORTH I am shopman to Mr Barker a pawnbroker in High Holborn—I produce a silver watch pawned on the 8th of May in the name of Charles Ellis 10 Castle-street—I do not recollect who by—the duplicate produced is the counterpart of the one upon it and corresponds in all respects RICHARD SAYER I am shopman to James Sayer a pawnbroker in Drury-lane—I produce a watch pawned on the 6th of January in the name of John Ellis 10 Castle-street—I believe I took it in—I have no recollection of the person—one of the duplicates produced belongs to it Cross-examined Q Is it your hand-writing A No my brother s—the person taking in the pledge does not always write the duplicate M MASSEY re-examined by MR PAYNE Q When had you last seen the watch pawned on the 6th of January A I had taken it in exchange on the 23rd of December 1839 the entry is in my own hand-writing—I was not at home at that time but I had a partner previous to that—I kept the accounts on in the old book after our separation they were put into the hands of a solicitor and I copied the entry out—the original entry was made by the prisoner—I made the entry in January—the watch was then in my shop—I was in Scotland at the end of last December for fire weeks—I came home about the middle of January—I left the prisoner in the management of the shop with my brother—I might have owed the prisoner 2l odd for wages at that time but I cannot say—this watch was taken in exchange in my absence—he did not tell me on my return that in consequence of my being absent longer than he expected and not having paid him the 2l he was obliged to raise a little money on this watch—he said nothing of the kind—I swear that positively—his wages were 30s a week—I might have owed him at different times from 2l to 3l —I paid him in full at least eighteen times out of twenty—there might have been a balance in his hands but generally he was paid his general weekly wages—I might have owed him something when I went to Scotland but when I came back whatever was owing was paid him and I gave him a sovereign besides— looking at a book —on the 8th of August this year he only received 1l when 30s was due—on the 15th of August 10s is entered to him but at that time there was a balance and a misunderstanding between us—he claimed about 2l as due to him—I know well he cheated us out of 10s more than was due to him—I got very warm on the occasion and said You have charged me 10s more than I owe you but I will take great care from this time there shall be no more mistakes and I entered it in the book and said We will put down now what your wages are and what you receive —I gave him 30s when there was 10s entered because I owed him a sovereign—this account does not leave 3l 0s 6d due to him at the time he was apprehended—there is not a balance of 3l in his favour—the balance is 1l 8s —I have his own hand-writing to prove it Q Here is piece-work 15s 6d A That I know nothing of—after a robbery took place he was suspected and I put him out of my shop—on the Saturday following he was taken into custody—there was no demand made for work done that week—he never asked me for money—as to what is charged against me at that time we never went into the matter—I positively swear he never told me that during my absence he had been compelled to pledge a watch—I never authorized him to pawn any watch whatever—I never knew they were pawned till he was stopped by the officer and the duplicates found—I will swear I did not give him this watch out of the window and authorize him to pawn it in lien of money—I did not owe him 4l on the 6th of August—I do not know that I owed him half-a-sovereign—I will not swear to one or two sovereigns—he did not ask my permission to pawn a watch he had in his own pocket—I once allowed a confidential traveller of mine named Clifton who had been in my employ twelve or fourteen years to pawn two watches as he wanted money greatly and said it would be a great favour if it was not convenient to me to let him have money and I gave him leave—I take my oath that was never done on any other occasion whatever—the prisoner has a wife and one child MR DOANE Q Has Clifton left your service A Yes a month or two ago—it is two years ago that I allowed him to pawn the two watches long before the prisoner was in my service—while he was with me I never suffered any body to pawn a watch and had no idea of it COURT Q When did the last watch come into your possession A On the 7th of November—it was pawned on the 6th of August—No 1955 came into my possession after I separated from my partner—I took the stock in which it is entered before I went my journey in November—they were all three in my possession before the 1st of January 1840 Joseph Clements watch-maker Oxford-street Jacob Hewett livery stable-keeper Hedgehog-mews William Walker

PHILLIP conducted the Prosecution ALLAN PHILLIP police-constables F 48 I went to the prisoner s lodgings and found there a considerable deal of property belonging to Mr Sangster and two duplicates relating to this property I found in his box—these are them—I know it was his lodging because I found a card in his pocket—I heard the prisoner say to Mr Sangster I hope you won t sir for it is the first time Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q What was the conversation you had with the prisoner when you took him A He asked me what I thought they would do with him—I said it was impossible to tell—he began to cry—I asked if he was married—he said no he was going to be married on Tuesday and if Mr Sangster would not give him in charge he would make it all right—he did not deny his guilt to me JOSEPH BAKER I am an assistant to a pawnbroker I produce three parasols and 186 umbrella handles which I believe to have been pawned by the prisoner for 1l 6s on the 29th of June—I gave the duplicates produced to the party—I do not remember making any inquiries about him—I imagined these handles to belong to a person who made these sort of things WILLIAM SANGSTER These parasols are mine—I have a workwoman to swear to them—I have not taken stock and found that I have 186 handles missing but I believe these are mine from some particular ones among them—some were made in Paris and some in Germany—here are two small heads which I have had in my possession eight or nine years—they were very expensively carved in Paris and were too dear for what they were intended—here are two feet carved in Paris—they never make such things in London Cross-examined Q Do you remember in June last the prisoner buying any parasol covers of you A No it was later than June—I should say he did not buy silk of this description of me—he wanted to have a dozen of soiled covers which I let him have which he never paid me for—I should say the cover of this parasol is not one of them most decidedly not—it is quite clean—he pawned this when he had been only ten days in my service—it was after June he bought of me—I swear that—these handles are mine—they manufacture in Paris for other persons but these two heads have been through my hands twenty times I suppose in stock taking—I do not think there is a workman in London could carve like them—I have handed to the prisoner articles of this sort to complete goods of mine—I when he had goods to work he took out a certain number of finishers and brought them home—he was not allowed to take home more than his parasols required Q Look at this Peruvian s head and tell me whether you did not hand that to him to put on a cane when he could get one A It might be so I really cannot recollect it—I might have said There is a particular head if you can find a cane put that in a certain lot of goods you are going to make —he had the management of that branch so much that I never looked much after it—if there were canes to be found to be applied to heads he did it but after the parasol season was over his book was closed and he ought to have brought back all he had—I cannot swear that there are heads here which were not delivered to him in the course of his work—it would be impossible for any manufacturer so to do Q Have you ever given him heads and before they were put on given him others and told him to put them on instead A Decidedly but not often—he may have had one or two heads but not one hundred and eighty-six—when I spoke to the prisoner he repeatedly kept putting his arm in mine and repeatedly said Let me go—it is the first time COURT Q Even if you did give him any of these things did you ever authorize him to pawn them A Never ANN SHEEN I work for Mr Sangster These two parasols I made for him I am certain— looking at too MR CLARKSO called WILLIAM DUTTON I am a water-gilder and umbrella-maker and live in Ogle-street I have worked for the prisoner in his business as an umbrella-maker—about June last the prisoner said he bad bought seven pairs of parasol covers of Mr Sangster and he showed them to me one by one—I did not receive any of them Q Are you able to say whether the covers of either of these three parasols is one A I am certain this is one— looking at a parasol —or one of the very same pattern—it is a soiled qne—the prisoner was in the habit of cleaning them before he put them on— looking at those identified by Sheen —I cannot swear to this one—I have seen one like it—I can swear to this other by the flowers being faded and I know the silk by the border Q But what do you know this silk by any more than any other piece of silk that came from the entire piece A I cannot tell only from the flowers being faded—I have got four parasols in my possession which I found in the prisoner s box when I took the things from his lodging after he was in custody and after the officer searched the premises—here they are— producing them —they are soiled and have been taken off old parasols Q Take up any one of the three parasols that have been produced and now mind how you answer this question for the prisoner s sake and for your own do you mean to tell the Jury that you believe this silk has been taken off another parasol and cleaned and put on this A I cannot swear that because the prisoner had a particular way of doing it Q Now look at the second do you believe that cover has been on a parasol and taken off and cleaned and put on another A Yes I do—this third one I cannot speak to—these heads and handles or some like them looking at them I have seen before the prisoner worked at Mr Sangster s—these two I saw before he worked there—this one I saw months before he worked at Mr Sangster s house when he worked for him at his lodging—I have seen heads like these others—I can only speak to a similarity of pattern—here is one the head of an Indian Chief which I saw in his lodging while he was working for Mr Sangster but not at his house—I made part of the frames of the seventeen or eighteen umbrellas in the last case only—we work one in another that is I have made one part and he another—he being a better hand than I am he has finished them—there is a mark on one of these parasols that I can swear to—this is the one— taking up one —here is the stain—the prisoner said he could not get it out—I cannot swear to this one—I had been at his lodging on the Saturday morning before he was taken—there were materials for making up many dozens of umbrellas and parasols MR PHILLIPS Q Did you ever see this Greek head A Yes at the prisoner s lodging I should think seven months ago—I remarked it particularly—he told me he had pawned some of the knobs and I believe he had pawned them—I would believe him if I heard him make an assertion Q Then if when Mr Sangster charged him with robbing him he said it was the first time would you believe him A I do not know MARY WHEELER The prisoner brought these three parasols to main June last to try to sell them—I took them to a lady and she said they were soiled—he said he had bought the covering of Mr Sangster and they were soiled—he was in the habit of making parasols and umbrellas—I made a great many for him JONES I am an umbrella frame-maker The prisoner has bought materials of me—he bought a few hooks about two months ago and bought silk of me four or five months ago but not such materials as those produced SAMUEL PRIOR I am an umbrella-manufacturer in Holborn I have known the prisoner perhaps a year and a half—he has bought materials of me for making parasols but I cannot identify any of these parasols—these heads were never in our house Susannah Barnett a parasol-coverer in Tichfield-street and Frederick Churchill a coal-merchant gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 21 — Transported for Seven

t18401214-292  292 WILLIAM COX and JAMES YOUNG were indicted for stealing on the 2nd of November 1600lbs weight of soda value 6l and 2 casks value 2s the goods of William James Chaplin and Benjamin Worthy Home their masters and EDWARD BANNISTER for feloniously inciting them to commit the said felony to which Cox pleaded GUILTY Aged— Confined One Year MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution DANIEL BENNETT SKEY I am chief clerk in the service of Messrs William James Chaplin and Benjamin Worthy Home proprietors of Hambro Wharf Upper Thames-street—they became proprietors in June last—at that time Cox and Young were their porters and warehousemen—Bannister was shipping and loading clerk—it was his duty to superintend the receipt of property on the wharf and to see to the faithful delivery of it out—he was to have returns of all the property—Cox and Young were subordinate to him—Bannister s situation made it necessary that confidence should be placed in him—on the 24th of June among other property turned over from the previous proprietors of the wharf to the present were 158 barrels of soda—the owner sent orders for 99 casks which were delivered up to July—that left 59 casks—in September I received an order to deliver the test and the whole were supposed to be delivered in September or October—soon after that there was a complaint that the whole had not been delivered—I referred to an account that Cox and Young kept of what had been delivered and found that 57 casks only had been delivered—I stated to Cox and Young that there was a deficiency of two casks of soda according to their statement and asked the reason they had not delivered the whole—they stated they had delivered the whole that was on the wharf and that there was not any soda whatever remaining on the wharf—there were at that time some bags of wool and some rags on a part of the wharf opposite the counting-house in which Bannister was employed and near to it whilst I was making my inquiries of Cox and Young I perceived two casks amongst the wool and rags—they were covered over and so concealed that unless any one had suspicion and were looking out they would not have been seen—there were bags of wool or rags on them—in going from the counting-house to the warehouse which it was the duty of Bannister to do several times a day he would pass by the spot where these casks were—I had this conversation with Cox and Young about a week or a fortnight after the delivery of the hat soda which was in October—on the 4th of November I received a letter from Child the watchman of the wharf and on the 18th or 19th I received a message from Messrs Coulthards the proprietors of the soda—I showed the letter to Bannister and asked if he knew any thing about the soda—he said he did not—that there was no soda on the premises—he said he would call Cox and Young to inquire of them—I said it was no use as I had spoken to them before—this was on a Thursday and on the Saturday following the prisoners were taken into custody—Cox and Young both stated they were going to make a search for the soda on the following morning and if they found any they would let me know Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q In the first conversation with Cox and Young did both of them speak A They spoke separately—both made the same answer—Cox was up in the first floor and Young down in the wharf Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q What hours was it your duty to be there A From nine till seven o clock—I have an office in another part of the premises—it is my duty to keep the accounts pay the men and receive the money—I keep account of the goods landed and see that my accounts are correct by comparing them with the goods coming in and going out—if any soda comes on the wharf or goes out I know it—I do not see the goods actually go away—I sit in the office and have the accounts brought to me—there are two other clerks Mr Oakley and Mr Haycock who attend to the railway and carrying department and I to the receipts of the wharf—before July the Commercial Company had the wharf—I ascertained that 158 barrels of soda were on the wharf then by taking the stock myself WILLIAM CHILD I am private watchman to the prosecutors on Hambro Wharf On the evening of the 2nd of November I went on duty at seven o clock and between seven and eight I saw Cox and Young rolling two casks of soda from behind the wool into the warehouse—after they got them there they took both the heads out—I went into the warehouse and asked what they were going to do with that soda—they said to take the heads out for the purpose of showing me that the soda was clean and as I dealt in the article I might bargain for it my wife keeps a shop —I asked them how they came by the soda—they said it was part of Messrs Coulthard s stock—that Mr Skey had made up his accounts and was satisfied that they had had their number and so were Messrs Coulthards that these were two casks that were left over and they did not consider that the soda belonged either to Chaplin and Home or to the late Company and if I would go to Mr Bannister be would give me every information—I asked the weight—they said about 12 cwt and Young said he had weighed one cask and he had marked on the head in black-lead pencil the weight which was 5 cwt —he showed me where it was marked and he supposed the other cask weighed 6 1/2 cwt —there was about 12 cwt together—each of them rolled a cask into the warehouse and Cox took the head out and showed me the the soda—I left the warehouse went to Bannister s office and said About the soda is it all right —he said as far as being right Mr Skey had made up his account and he was satisfied that Coulthards had had their number and Coulthards were satisfied also—there were two casks that were left and he neither considered that they belonged to Chaplin and Horne or to the late Company and they were going to dispose of it—I then asked what he wanted for it—he said he should leave that entirely to William Cox to dispose of it and whatever was got for them he would take his share and go snacks with them—I then returned to the warehouse where Cox and Young were and told Cox that Bannister said he would leave it entirely to his disposal—Young was in the warehouse at the time—Cox then said I should have it for 3l 10s —I said very well I would consider of it and let them know in the course of a day or two—I then wrote this letter looking at it and gave it into the hands of Mr Skey—on the 8th of November which was Sunday as I was sweeping up the wharf Bannister came and asked whether I had agreed with William Cox for the soda if I had he said it was Thomas Cox s turn to the Western railroad on the Monday and Chittenden s on the Tuesday and Thomas Cox would be at liberty to bring the soda over to my house—on the following morning Monday the 9th of November I saw William Cox on the wharf—I told him my wife had got sufficient soda by her and could not make any more room for it and I should be obliged to decline having any thing to do with it—the soda still remained in the same place under the rags—after the heads had been knocked out in the warehouse they were rolled back again—I saw it on the wharf on Thursday night the 19th of November—on Monday night the 16th of November I saw William Cox on the wharf and asked him if he had disposed of the soda—he said he had not—I asked on the following night if he had disposed of it—he said he had sold it to the Jew for 4l and he expected it would be fetched away on the following Thursday—I saw William Cox again on the Thursday and asked if he had seen the Jew—he said he had not but if he did not come and fetch it away he should be obliged to dispose of it to some one else as there had been a stir about it and Coulthards had written about the missing casks—on Friday the 20th of November I saw Young on the wharf when I came on duty at night and asked him if the soda was gone—he said yes both the casks were gone clear off the wharf and there was only a small remnant of soda left in an empty cask and if so be they were applied to on the subject they should state that they had searched the wharf all over and that was all they could possibly find the soda was gone then —on the Saturday Young and Cox were in custody—I went into Bannister s office and he said it was a lucky job that I had had nothing to do with it and said it was a very bad job—at that moment I was called away by Mr Home who happened to be on the spot and in consequence of what Mr Home said to me I returned to Bannister s office and Bannister wanted to know of me what Mr Home had said—I told him Mr Home had been questioning me about the soda and I had told him I knew nothing about it I said that by direction of my master —Bannister said he hoped I should continue to say so and if the prisoners kept their own counsel nothing could hurt them—on the Sunday following Bannister came to me about ten o clock at night just before I retired to rest—he said he hoped I should continue to say what I had said before on the morrow when I went before the Magistrate—I afterwards received some information from Mr Beard and went to Chamberlain s Wharf in Tooley-street—I there found two casks of soda and on one of the heads I saw the pencil-mark that Young had before pointed out to me Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q How long have you been watchman there A Nine or ten weeks—MR Home gave me the situation—I had asked Bannister to get me a better situation as I had been on the wharf before and he said he would do his best for me—it was a little after seven o clock in the evening when the casks were rolled to the ware-house which was nine or ten yards from where they were—after I had had the conversation with W Cox and Young I went into the office and saw Bannister there—he was in the office when they were rolling the casks—I do not know whether he was looking at them—he was going on with his accounts—his office was right opposite them JOHN CHITTENDEN I am a carman in the service of Messrs Chaplin and Home On the 20th of November I removed two casks of soda from Hambro wharf to Chamberlain s wharf—William Cox gave me the note to take them—I left them there in the name of White—I denied all knowledge of this till I was taken into custody—I then confessed it WILLIAM COLLYER City police-constable No 404 I produce this head of a cask which I got at Chamberlain s wharf WILLIAM CHILD re-examined This head bears the pencil mark that was pointed out to me by Young—it is 5 cwt 1 qr Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Do you know his writing A Yes—I know it well—I swear this is his writing JOHN CHITTENDEN re-examined Q Did you run away as soon as there was a stir made about this A No—I went to get my dinner Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q When did you take the casks A On Friday a little after seven o clock in the morning—they were under the frame ready for loading—James Young loaded them—it was daylight and after the business of the wharf bad commenced—they were not above seven or eight yards from the counting-house where Bannister sits—I do not know whether he was on the wharf or whether his counting-house was open—there were a great many men at work on the floors but not on the wharf—I took nothing beside the soda only a note in the name of White which William Cox gave me—after I came back about half-past eight or nine o clock I saw Bannister in his usual place—I was taken into custody about six o clock on Saturday night—I was then had up on Monday and said I took it The prisoners received good characters BANNISTER— GUILTY — Transported for Seven Years YOUNG— GUILTY — Confined One Year

Prosecution JOHN CHADWICK I am a buyer of hosiery for Messrs Morrisson of Fore-street I made some purchases of Mr Cotton a hosier in Nottingham and on the 22nd of December I received five hampers in Milton-street near Fore-street—they contained from 80 to 130 dozen pairs of stockings each—there was no invoice with them—that came by post—the hampers were numbered—among them was one No 29—it ought to have contained 52 dozen of No 7 and 69 dozen of No 8 of women s cotton stockings—there was a deficiency of three dozen in the paper marked No 8—the woven mark on the stockings was No 300—I did not ascertain the quantity that was in the hamper till after the policeman came which was I should think about the 25th or 26th of December—I can undertake to swear that the hamper was in the same state when I looked at it as when it came to our house—the hampers were removed but none of the goods removed from them—these articles were at the top of the hamper under the lid Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Were they under your eye all the time A Yes—I did not observe No 29 in particular—they were all rather loosely corded—after the policeman called I examined it and it appeared loose—the whole property in the hamper was worth 60l —the three dozen pairs were worth about 1l 14s JOHN COTTON I am a stocking manufacturer at Nottingham In November last I sold some goods to Mr Chadwick for the house of Morrisson—I put up among other things 69 dozen of women s cotton stockings—the woven number on them was 300—that is to distinguish our own manufacturing—each manufactory has its own particular number for particular kinds of goods—these stockings were enclosed in a paper parcel marked No 8 and the hamper was No 29—I looked to the packing of this hamper—there were 69 dozen of this particular sort in that hamper—there was a mistake in directing the hampers and they were directed to Messrs Person s Cross-examined Q When was it you sent them up A They left me on the 18th of November—I have seen some of them since in possession of Restieaux the officer COURT Q Can you speak to those as part of those you packed in No 29 A I can—those which were found on the prisoner are part of them—I know them by the mark on the paper and by the make and by the stamp on them which is peculiar to myself JOHN GOOD I am warehouseman to Messrs Person and Co in St Paul s churchyard I received some advice from Mr Cotton of some goods and we received five hampers—from some advice which we afterwards received we sent them all back to Messrs Pickford s—they had never been opened in

fortnight—they were never opened during that time—we had four other hampers there—they were not touched—these hampers were sent back in the same state in which they came as far as I know CHARLES WTATT

was part of my business to remark if the packages were disturbed and I should have marked it in the way-bill—these hampers were sent round to what we call the order warehouses on the 19th—on the 18th they remained on what is called the receiving bank which is a raised part for goods—the prisoner was in the employ of Messrs Pickford in the up side in which things come from the country—those goods which are to be delivered in town are put into the wagon and the others in the order warehouse—it would be the prisoner s duty to have them sent there and he had access to the warehouse Cross-examined Q That is to say the door of the warehouse was not locked A No—the prisoner s business would carry him to the ware-house—there is always a gatekeeper to see that persons do not carry things away without a proper pass MR PRENDERGAST Q Do you mean every person is examined A No person is allowed to take out a parcel WILLIAM KEMP I remember the five hampers being in Pickford s order warehouse—I saw them there on the 19th of December—the prisoner was employed there that day—I saw him about seven or a quarter-past seven o clock that evening—it was his business to go to the order warehouse—there is a place called the bank—the prisoner was generally employed there—that is about fifteen or sixteen yards from the order warehouse—he would have occasion to go to the order warehouse—I have two ware-houses there and am frequently obliged to be away from the order ware-house—the prisoner quitted from eight to half-past eight Cross-examined Q What length of time were you absent from the order warehouse A Sometimes a quarter of an hour or half an hour—I have known the prisoner nine years—he was brought up from a boy there GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX police-constable E 49 On Saturday evening the 19th of December I was in Church-street St Giles s about a quarter-past nine o clock I saw the prisoner and two others in company—in consequence of something I observed I went up to the prisoner—he seemed confused—he had a bundle under his arm—I stopped him and the other two made off in the direction of Oxford-street—I asked the prisoner what he had got—he said two coats which were his own and had been so for six months and if I would go to Pitman s-buildings his wife would prove it—I produce the coats—they are old and appear to have been worn by some gentleman being of a superior make—one of them is a frock-coat and the other a close body-coat—I took him to the station and in his trowsers I found this packet of stockings—I said What have you got there —he said They are stockings —I said Is it any use going to your wife —he said No—she knows nothing at all about it—I found them —in going to Hatton-garden on the Monday he said he picked the bundle up in St Luke s churchyard on Saturday night the coats tied in a handkerchief and the stockings tied at the top of the bundle—Saturday night was wet and sloppy and the bundle was quite clean—I found on him two knives and some papers belonging to Mr Fickford which led me to make inquiries RICHARD BROUGHTON I am shopman to Mr Thnrsfield at the corner of Han way-yard Oxford-street On Saturday the 19th of December about nine o clock I heard a rustle among some boards which have play-bills on them at our door and I saw something thrown into the shop—as soon as I had done serving a customer I went and picked it

constable employed by the Regent s Canal Company On the 21st of January I was crossing the City-road bridge at about a quarter to ten o clock in the evening I observed a wagon in Mr Crowley s employ coming over the bridge—I saw no one with it till I went to the back—I then saw the prisoner and a countryman in the wagon—they seemed as if they were hunting about for some parcels—during that time a boiler-plate fell out—in two or three minutes I saw the prisoner throw his arm over the wagon and heard something fall in the road which sounded like a glass bottle—I went to the spot and picked up this part of a glass bottle and smelt it—it appeared to me to have held wine—I then looked at the two persons in the wagon—the countryman was very much intoxicated indeed and so was the prisoner but the countryman was the most drunk—I saw something dropping from the wagon which appeared to be wine—I carried the glass bottle to Mr Bulmer and gave information—he returned with me down Wharf-road and met the wagon coming down—the prisoner was taken to the counting-house and given into my custody on suspicion of stealing wine—he muttered something—as well as I could make out it was that he knew

five—after taking the prisoner to the station I went to Camden Town and found the hamper had had the cord cut and five bottles taken out—it was new port wine are those in the hamper were the same bottles the same corks the same age and every thing—I asked the prisoner what he had been doing with some wine—he said Nothing whatever —I said How came the bottles in your wagon —he said he knew nothing about it Cross-examined Q How long had he been in your service A About seven months—we had a character with him HENRY FARRAH I accompanied the prisoner part of the way from the City-road basin

t18410201-789  789 THOMAS DENNY and WILLIAM KINGATE were indicted for stealing on the 5th of December 518lbs weight of printed paper value 24l the goods of John Young and another their masters MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution JOHN YOUNG I am partner with Mr Charles Knight We are publishers carrying on business in Ludgate-street—we have a warehouse in Cornwall-road Lambeth—Kingate has been in our service as warehouseman and porter upwards of two years—he was employed great part of his time at the warehouse in Cornwall-road—we have a very large quantity of publications there in quires and amongst the rest nearly the whole of the stock of the Penny Cyclopæedia—there is a particularly large number of surplus volumes of Nos 1 and 16 of that work—up to the 31st of December Mr How had the entire superintendence of the property at the warehouse in Cornwall-road—he then left and went into business with another gentleman in Fleet-street—in July last Mr How directed Kingate to take stock at the warehouse in conjunction with another person from the house in Ludgate-street—Kingate must have known then that there was a large surplus of Nos 1 and 16 of the Penny Cyclopædia there—I believe he did not know it before—a person named Durrant slept on the premises at the warehouse and had the charge of the premises at night—I saw about 9cwt of paper at Union-hall which is our property—it had never been sold nor made up for sale—it was part of the stock from our warehouse and is in sheets as we keep our stock there—we are the sole publishers and proprietors of the Penny Cyclopædia—I never authorised either of the prisoners to sell any portion of it—Kingate was discharged on the 5th of December—I gave him warning a fortnight before—I had not at that time found out that any felony had been committed by him—neither of the prisoners had any authority to sell any waste paper of any kind Cross-examined by MR BODKIN A Is not the Penny Cyclopædia published by a society A It is published under the superintendence of a society but it is our own property CHARLES KNIGHT I am in partnership with Mr Young—I saw some of our Penny Cyclopædia at Mr Pegg s a stationer in Upper Ground-street—heis a purchaser of materials for paper-making—he buys ropes and waste paper—I went with the offiecr there on the 23rd of December and found ten luindles of paper there—I think about five or six cwt —the value of the paper and print of what I saw at Pegg s and afterward at Hatherway s was upwards of 100l —I never authorised either of the prisoners to sell these or any other articles as waste paper Cross-examined Q Did you see Mr Pegg A Yes—he was exceedingly willing to show every thing—we traced from Mr Hatherwgy that Mr Pegg had sold some to him—Mr Pegg was taken as a witness on the part of the prosecution and examined JEREMIAH How I am a partner with Mr Parsons—we are publishers in Fleet-street—I was the superintendent at Mr Knight s till the end of December—I had the control of their warehouse in the Cornwall-road—Kingatewas in the prosecutor s employ and was principally at the ware-house—in July last it became desirable to take stock there and Kingate was employed to do it—that would enable him to ascertain the number of volumes of the Penny Cyclopaedia which were there—the whole stock went under his eye—I do not know that it was removed at all but it must have been referred to to ascertain the quantity—Denny was recommended to us by Kingate as we wanted assistance about the spring of last year—I knew him by sight before but had not employed him—he was employed occasionally and paid by the day—I authorized his being engaged and he went to assist Kingate at the warehouse or at the house in Ludgate-street but not without my authority—Kingate had no authority to aet him on either at the warehouse or at Ludgate-street without receiving orders from me—Denny continued as an occasional servant up to the time of his apprehension Q Did you ever find Denny where you did not expect to find him A Yes once at the warehouse in Cornwall-road—Kingate was at work there at the time—I complained to Kingate and to the shopman who paid Denny for employing Denny there without my orders—I asked Denny how he came there he said Kingate had employed him—I told Kingate he had no right to have him there as he well knew without my authority and I sent Denny away—I never authorized either of the prisoners to sell waste paper Cross-examined Q Was it at the house in Ludgate-street that you desired Denny to go away A No at the warehouse I am quite sure—on another occasion I sent him away from Ludgate-street—after that I sanctioned his services when he was wanted—there is a person named Wakefield in the prosecutor s service—he is shopman at Lndgate-street—I never heard him say that he had promised Denny a job the first opportunity and from that Denny was employed—Kingite ought to have gone to the house in Ludgate-street every day and then to have come to the ware-house but on magazine days and busy times he was kept at the house—when stock was taken opportunity was given to Kingate to see the publications at the warehouse—no person was employed in that but Kingate and Denny when he assisted him—the general stock of the house was kept there—there are three or four printers and persons employed there but not in the warehouse part MR CLARKSON Q Would you be more or less likely to miss from your stock those articles which were in course of publication or those that you had surplus volumes of A We should not miss these surplus volumes till stock was taken again—these Penny Cyclopaedias would be articles to wich my attention would not be so readily called as to other articles—Kingate was employed to take stock and Denny to assist him in the warehouse as porter—five or six cwt of this paper could not have been taken from the warehouse without the knowledge of Kingate from the opportunities he had of being employed there—the 5th of December was not a magazine night—it was the duty of Kingate to have been at the warehouse till he was discharged that day and he was there the whole day I know—that was the day he left—if on that day five or six cwt of paper was taken away it could not have gone without his knowledge—it was on Saturday—Kingate was there till the evening—I know he was there till after five o clock because I sent a messenger to him about five o clock JAMES WILLIAM DURRANI I am in the service of Messrs Knight and Young and live on the premises where their warehouse is—I have the care of the keys of the warehouse after the persons engaged in the service leave it—I remain on the premises there unless I have occasion to go to Ludgate-street or elsewhere—Kingate generally came about half-past nine or from that to eleven o clock—it was my practice to deliver the keys to him there and I received them from him in the evening—the usual time of leaving was at dusk—the binder s men usually opened the gate and it was my duty to see that it was fastened—there is a large pair of gates which it is not usual to open except for carts—I have seen the property which is sworn to as Messrs Knight and Young s—I am certain that could not have left the premises by the smaller gate without my attention being called to it—the keys of the warehouse would remain in Kingate s possession from the time I gave them to him in the morning till he left in the evening—I was not employed in the warehouse but in ao entirely different part of the premises—I had nothing to do with the ware-house Cross-examined Q You gave the keys to Kingate when he came A Yes the small gate was not kept locked during the day—the large one was fastened with two bolts THOMAS ALLISTON I am in the service of Mr Pegg in Upper Ground-street Blackfriars-road I was so in December last—I have known the prisoner Denny since last May I think—I became acquainted with him by his bringing waste paper to sell at Mr Pegg s—before he brought any he came and asked me if we bought waste paper and what we gave for it—Isaid we could not tell till we saw it and then he brought us a bundle—Ido not recollect any other conversation—he came to us on the 5th of December about half-past five or six o clock in the evening with another man and brought with him some paper as he was in the habit of bringing—bebrought some of the Penny Cyclopaedia—I do not know whether there was any other sort—I believe there was some of the Bible—he brought then 4cwt 2qrs 14lbs —I weighed it—it was in the state that these bundles are— looking at them —I cannot distinguish which of these bundles it was—it was in this state in quires—it has not even been stitched for the purpose of being sold—we gave him 28s per cwt and that lot on the 5th of December came to 6l 9s 6d —I asked him at first where he came from and he told us from Messrs Knights —we told him if there was much more of it we would send the cart and he said he would bring it as it was looked out Q who was the person with Denny on the 5th of December A I believe it to be Kingate to the best of my knowledge—I have no doubt—Ibelieve it to be him to the best of my knowledge Q When you first went before the Magistrate was Denny in custody A Yes and I was asked if I knew the other person—I was asked to pick him out of the crowd—he was standing in the audience of the hall of the Court at the back of the bar—I should think there were forty 01 fifty Persons there—I picked out Kingate—I had not won him since the 5th of December Q were you brought up a second time before the Magistrate A Yes—Kingatewas at that time in custody with Denny—l was asked some question by the Magistrate—the two person who came to my master on the 5th of December came together—the person who came with Denny brought in one bundle of paper and then went out again—I did not look outside to see if he came in a cart or with a truck Cross-examined Q How long have you been in the service of Mr Pegg A Four years and a half—I was not aware when I went to the police Court that my attention would be drawn to some person there—the Magistrate told me to go round the Court and see if I could find the man—I went round the Court so as to give myself an opportunity of seeing the persons that were there Q Did you then tell the Magistrate that you saw nobody there that you recognise A I did say so at first but I did not see all the persons in the Court then—my attention was again directed to the persons by the Magistrate—I walked round again and then I picked out Knight—I said that I picked him out because he seemed to be the most likely person Q On the 5th of December was Mr Pegg in the way when these things were brought A He was passing through the shop—he saw Denny—Ibelieve he did not see the other man—I saw the other man then and I had seen him on the night before—I only saw him on those two occasions—Mr Pegg was not in the way when the man came the night before—Mr Pegg drew the cheque on the 5th of December—I took it up to him and brought it down to Denny—the other man was then gone—it was dark—the gas was lighted—the other man was no longer in the shop that night than he was the night before—I heared Denny make was examined—he was noit examined on oath the first time but he was the second time for the procecution—I saw my master last Monday week Q were you not asked by the Magistrate whether you should have known the man you picked out if you had not him in the street and did you not say no A I said I did not know that I should—perhaps if I was looking after him I should—Mr Pegg deals largly in waste paper— publicationsthet don t sell are often brought in this state for sale and law books amongst others MR CLARKSON Q And are you come to tell us that your master in in the habit of buying them in sucb a state A Yes—the first time I went round the Police Court I did not get any sight of the person of Kin-gate—when I did find him he was amongst more people than there were in the middle of the Court at the back of the Court standing up—the moment I saw him I picked him out Q Did the Magistrate ask you whether if you had seen him in the street you should have felt yourself authorished to give him into custody A Yes and I said I did not know that I should have had authority to to give him into custody—I was not aware at that time that I had any authority to give him into custody at all—I had never seen Kingate before the night of the 4th of December—the first I went round I did not see his face and as soon as I saw his face I picked him ont—my master is at Reading—he went there last tuesday week MR BODKIN Q Was not Kingate standing at the bar in front of the persons who were facing the Magistrate when you first went into the Court A Yes I believe he was—I had been told that he was in custody MR CLARKSON Q Who told you Kingate was in custody A My master—I had no opportunity of seeing him but on the 4th and 5th—I believe when I first went into the body of the Court that Kingate was standing in front—I do not know how he got to the part of the Court where I found him—I picked him out from about the middle of the Court—Ido not know who moved him from the front to the middle—the first time perhaps I did not look close enough to notice him—I did not see him in front when I first went round—it was not till the second time that I saw him at all COURT Q But you say you believe Kingate was in front of the bar do you form that opinion from what you heard or saw A I did not see him till the second time—I knew he was somewhere in the Court MR CLARKSON Q How did you know that he was A The Magistrate told me to go round and pick him out—I was sent out while he was brought in and put amongst the people—up to the time I came back I had not seen him at all—I was ordered out while he was mixed with the crowd—that was the express object of the Magistrate—I was then brought back and went round to look for him—I could not see him the first time—Ithen walked round again and said I believed that was the man—I saw him in front of the bar when I picked him out—he was standing in front of the Magistrate—I believe there were other persons in front of him—he was not in the dock till after I picked him out HATHAWAY I carry on the business of a stationer on College-hill I produce some paper which was bought by my brother who is not here—it consists of the Penny Cyclopaedia in sheets—it has never been made into books—we gave 36s a cwt for it as waste paper which is about 4d a pound—I did not know that it was the Penny Cyclopaedia till this occurred—I never looked at the title of it JOSEPH GARWOOD I am pot-boy at the Cornwall Arms public-house which is on the same side of the way as Mr Knight s warehouse in the Cornwall-road eight or nine houses before you get to it I know both the prisoners—they have been in the habit of using our public-house about two or three times a week—the last time I saw them together was on a Saturday evening in the early part of December—I dare say I have seen them together in our public-house twenty times—they usually came about lunch-time Cross-examined Q I suppose your house is frequented by the persons who work at that establishment A Yes NICHOLAS EDWIN I am clerk to the Justices of Union Hall Police Court I was present at the examination of the prisoners on this charge on the 24th of December—the prisoner Denny made a statement which I wrote down from his mouth—I transcribed this statement from my book—thisis a faithful account of what fell from his lips on that occasion and it was signed by the Magistrate—on the last examination the 21st of January it was read over to Denny and he was asked if we would sign it—Mr Robinson his solicitor said My client declines signing any thing — read — Theprisoner Denny on his examination before me on the 24th of December last stated as follows — I have known Kingate the foreman of Messrs Young about twelve months—I never received any paper from him to dispose of—the paper I took to Mr Pegg was delivered to me at different times by a man who had an open green cart and a grey bone—he came to me at my house the first time about four months ago—I do not know his name nor where he lived—he said he understood I was out of work—I said I was—he said if I would meet him in the afternoon about four o clock at the corner of Rennet-street to take a load to Mr Pegg s he would give me the job—I went and he gave me several bundles of paper wrapped up in brown paper—he told me to take them to Mr Pegg s—I did so—they were weighed and 1 was paid for them—I gave the money to that man—he gave me 3s and a part of a pint of ale—I have been so employed by that man about twenty times—he used to appoint a time for me to meet him again before we parted or he used to call at my house—he always paid me 2s 6d or 3s —I should know that man again—I was aware it was the Penny Cyclopaedia and said it was Knight s work—the man never told me where he got it or any thing about it The prisoner being advised by his professional attendant declined signing the above —E H MALTBY Cross-examined Q At the time Denny made this statement was Kingate there in custody A He was sir standing at the bar with Denny—I have the examination of a man named Pegg—he was examined on oath as a witness for the prosecution COURT Q Why is he not here A His young man proved as much as he did and rather more MR CLARKSON Q Have you furnished a copy of that statement to the attorney for Kingate A Yes I had not the authority of the Magistrate for doing so—we are bound to do so—I furnished him also with a copy of the depositions—I have in my book the examination to which Alliston was exposed by the Magistrate when he pointed out Kingate and I have the subsequent examination—I have taken the answers down very particularly— reads — William Pegg on his oath says The prisoner Denny brought the whole of the paper to me which is claimed by Messrs Knight and Co —I bought it and sold it as waste-paper—I never saw the prisoner Kingate in the transaction—I sold a quantity to Mr Hathaway of the same—Denny told me he brought it from Messrs Knight s and I bought it believing he was sent directly by them and I offered to send my horse and cart if there was any quantity of it Wednesday Dec 30 1840 Thomas Alliston servant to Mr Pegg on his oath says I believe the prisoner Kingate to be the person who came twice with Denny and brought paper to my master s house the last time was on the 5th of December I identified him this day whilst standing with others in this public Court Thursday Jan 7 1841 Thomas Alliston servant to Mr Pegg on his oath says I am not certain the prisoner Kingate is the man who came with Denny to the best of my belief he is I picked him out on the former day because he is the most likely person William Pegg says I never saw Kingate I saw Denny several times he told me he was sent by Mr Knight s foreman to sell it I told him if there was a quantity I would rathers end mo horse and cart and give a cheque for it He said he would speak to the foreman When I saw him again he told me that the foreman wanted the paper out of the way My boy could buy paper and it might not nppear entered in my book The 4th and 5th were the last days I purchased to the best of my knowledge The greatest quantity brought to me at one time was 200lbs it was all brought by Denny I know nothing of Kingate I purchased above 30 cwt it came in a bookbinder s bag and always in the day-time Thomas Alliston further says The greatest quantity I bought from the prisoner Denny at one time was 200lbs MR CLARKSON Q Were you there when Alliston pointed out Kin-gate A Yes and Kingate complained that one of the officers coughed and called his attention to him—it was investigated and proved it was not so Cross-examined Q When Kingate was brought up on the day he was identified was he in the first instance put as a person accused by the side of Denny A I have no doubt they were both put into the slip or place which we call the dock in the first instance—he was afterwards taken out from there and put amongst the persons in the Court to be identified and the witness was ordered out of Court when he was taken out of the dock and mixed with the people and then the witness was to go and find him MR CLARKSON Q Can you undertake to say that Alliston was in Court and had an opportunity of seeing Kingate in the dock A I cannot answer that—Kingate said The boy saw me in the slip before I was identified and the boy was examined on his oath and swore he had never seen him The depositions of the other witnesses being read agreed with their evidence EDMUND WESTBROOK

the second baiting-house and the prisoner told me just before we got there not to tell of the boy s riding or else we should be in the wrong of it—he walked all the way to Hertford—he said If you split we shall be transported all of us —he said nothing else but got up into the wagon and rode on to Wormley—my master had a dog that used to go with the wagon—he was a middling sharp one—he used to

two days—we had a dog killed that night—it was quite a puppy—it was not ours—it was Hubberston s—our dog barked when strangers came near the wagon—if we took any one up it would bark at first THOMAS

and the prisoner too—the prisoner then awoke me by treading on me—I cannot tell how long I had been asleep—I saw the prisoner lift out a chest of tea standing and then he lifted out the other kneeling—he then took the straw from where the snuff laid and took that out—I did not see whether any thing was behind the wagon—the horses stood still at first and then the prisoner hallooed to them and they went on—the prisoner was on the top of the wagon when they stopped—I knew his voice and could see his cap—the boy was in the wagon—there was no one with the horses—I could see from the first horse to the last—there was a tarpaulin on the wagon—the prisoner lifted it up before he took the tea out—after he took it out he made it right again—I saw a man standing on the side receiving the things—he had a cap on and a white smock-frock—he was one of the men I had seen in the yard at the Basing-house—there was something like a truck or cart by the side but I could not see distinctly—I

conducted the Prosecution SARAH WHITE I am single and live at Pensbury Wandsworth-road Clapham—I am a connexion of ope of the learned Judges The prisoner came into my service eighteen months ago as needle-woman and afterwards to take charge of the empty hoube which I had taken it Pensbury—I had taken the house but it was not ready for my reception—I removed my things there last March twelve months—they consisted of clothes plate books and various other things—I was in the habit of using part of them the others were kept locked up in different rooms in the house—the prisoner knew where—the keys were placed in a bag—I kept my plate in a tin case under my bed for some time and after that in a room where my niece was—I have frequently inquired of the prisoner for the keys of different places in the house and they were lost in basket when I went to Brighton—I had seen it a very few weeks before I found it at the pawnbroker s—I asked her about this tea caddy when I returned home on the 17th or a few days afterwards and she said Is it not there Maam meaning on the drawers where it was usually kept—I said It is not —she said Then it is in the closet —I looked in and put the closet to rights entirely and it was not there—she then said It must be in the glass case —I said That is impossible it is not its place —she then said It roust be in the tin case —when she went to the empty house she said her husband must go with her and a man whom she represented as her husband came to live afterwards in the house where I was residing—there is no pretence for saying that any impropriety ever passed between me and him—he was a most horrid fellow swearing and drinking continually—the prisoner left the house on Easter Monday without giving me any notice—I did not know where she was gone to—I expected her to return that night—I never saw her till she was in custody—after I found she had left in this manner I sent on the Wednesday for the police and the locksmith—when the policeman came I asked him to go up stairs and look into her room—the door was fast and as I did not wish to break the lock the locksmith got in at the window—he found the door was not locked but fastened by a night bolt and the tape—he unfastened it and let the policeman in—when the policeman got in I found a small box belonging to the prisoner—several of these duplicates Were found in it five or six between the bed and mattress some in a bottom drawer one or two in the finger of her glove there are sixty-three altogether—the pap-boat and decanter labels were safe in the house before she went away—I had seen them six or seves weeks before—upon my oath I never authorised her to pawn any of these articles Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Where was it you first became acquainted with the prisoner A At Lark hall-rise at her mother s house—I called to get a person to do needle-work—some time after I was going to give a fete and the prisoner s mother offered me her table but I did not give the fete—I was living at Larkhall-rise at that time and was walking out looking for a sempstress—I saw the prisoner and asked her if she could tell me of one—she said yes she did it—the prisoner then came backwards and forwards to my house to do needlework but not to sleep October 1839 the prisoner and her husband went to my house—I —in gave her money to purchase a ton of coals which I believe she did—that was at the time she went into the house and I gave—her money from time to time to the amount of 9l or 10l —there was no agreement that I should pay her 7s a week—I wished her to name her terms but she would not—I had no goods in the house at the time only what were taken from the landlord—I do not know whether she bad any—I did not go there till March—I supplied her with money from time to time—I gave her 30s for the coals and other money—I gave her 5l one day—when I went to the house I did not examine what goods she had there—I did not go in till March because the repairs were not finished and they are not now—I went in in March 1840 because I was tired of waiting—I remained there till July when I went to Brighton—I might have gone to town for two or three days between March and July—I now recollect I did go to town for three weeks in April or May—I brought the whole of my goods from Lark-hall-rise and at that time the prisoner and her husband were there and assisted in moving—I remained there till I went to Brighton—I went to town before I went to Pensbury—when I came back from town the prisoner did not tell me the landlord wanted his rent—I paid 60l when it was applied for part my own rent and part back rent—there may be six months rent due now—Mr Ker has applied to me—the last time the rent was paid Mr Hopkins and Mr Ker levied for half a year s rent—it was paid besides the levy which was 4l —I went to town for a few days and on my return which was on a Sunday I understood from the prisoner that there had been a levy in the house from the Friday—I went to Mr Ker the superior landlord about it and went to town on the Monday and settled it—I think I had to pay six months rent 40l when the distress was put in—I have not got back any part of it—I have not endesvoured to get it—I never heard of the distress till Sunday—I do not recollect what month it was in—they did distrain in Larkhall-rise but not for my own rent—I paid it to save my furniture—I gave the upholsterer who was moving my things 12l but I did not get the man out so easily—they still seized upon the furniture and sold 50l worth of it for the levy—it was 10l rent and 2l expenses—ray landlord s name was Rivet—he is since dead—there is not an execution in my house now for rent—I have not been threatened with another distress—the last rent was due in

small sums—I have been made to pay them sometimes unjustly—I have sent the prisoner to appear and she has not—I have never sent her to raise the money to pay it—I have sent her to answer the summons which she has failed in doing which has brought on me double the expense—I have a butcher named Brook he summoned me for another person s debt—he came into my room where my niece was dying and to settle the affair I paid him 4l to get rid of the officer—it was a Mrs Lainson s debt Q Do you know Jones a baker A Yes he sued me for the same person s debt—my solicitor settled it with him—I never

it—I had two witnesses with me when I paid it Q Were you ever taken in execution A No—my person was seized at my own house by an officer named Fletcher—it was an unjust debt—a man took me and behaved very ill—I did not order the prisoner on that occasion to take out some of my property to pledge—I myself pawned on that occasion—I sent the prisoner to three neighbours but she never went—I walked up the Wandsworth-road with the officer to call on another friend—I took out my watch—the officer said Why don t you pawn your watch —I said I don t know how to go about it —he said I will take it to a respectable man —he took it and brought me out the moriey—he said How much do you want —I said How much will satisfy you Q Did you not give the prisoner leave to go to the fair A No—I did not know there was a fair—she went out when she pleased—she did not come back the same evening and was locked out—I know she did not come back—she went and slept at Mrs Belger s near the Temple—she was absent on Monday and Tuesday and on Wednesday her sister came to know if she had returned—I said She will not come here again I have no notion of a servant going out of my house and stopping two nights MR

his presence direct the prisoner to go and get the money A Yes I sent her to my linen-draper s where I frequently cashed cheques—I told her to go to Mr Swan and ask him if he had got such a sum in his house but he was not at home—if I had got it I should not have had to pawn my watch—I did not pay the officer by means of money the prisoner brought JOHN NEW police-constable V 136 On Wednesday the

the same well knowing it to have been stolen against the Statute &c MR PRENDERGAST conducted the Prosecution ROBERT CHARLES I am a soap-manufacturer in High-street Wapping my premises are by the river-side close to where the Tunnel will open at the bottom of Old Gravel-lane the back of the premises is bounded by Brewhouse-lane—Brosnan has been in my employ about two years and was employed in the fancy soap-manufactory which was then at the back of the premises adjoining Brewhouse-lane—there is another soap-maker s at the top of Old Gravel-lane and a small manufactory about the centre of Old Gravel-lane but not very near my premises On the 23rd of September the witness Austin called at my counting-house and gave me some information—I directed him to go and look among my men—he came back and gave me some further information—in consequence of what he told me I called Brosnan before me not in Austin s presence—my son who was in the counting-house first said to him You have robbed us —he replied You cannot prove that —I immediately said That is no answer you have robbed me —he turned exceedingly pale and became much agitated—he caught hold of the bars in the counting-house before the desk and after a little while he said It is too true or I have robbed you —I cannot exactly say which of the two sentences he uttered but either one or the other he certainly said—I asked him to what extent—he said Not to much —I said was it to the extent of 5cwt —he said it might be—I said perhaps it was half a ton for I began to be a little alarmed—he said yes it might be half a ton—I then said to him Now it will be better for you to tell the whole —I afterwards desired him to go to his work and sent for an officer—he was taken into custody about ten minutes afterwards—after being in custody about a fortnight he was discharged—he never had any authority to sell any soap—from the extent of my stock a considerable quantity might easily be taken away without its being missed WILLIAM AUSTIN I have lodged with the prisoner Mason at three different places—in December last I lodged with him at No 19 Angel-place Blackfriars-road—I have seen Brosnan there a great number of times in and previous to December last—I have heard Brosnan remark to Mason that he should be up stairs in the forepart of the week and he would send him a note and let him know when to come down and there has been a note come—I have heard Mason s wife say that she had had a letter from Wapping and he must go down—he has said I will go and he has taken his basket and been to Wapping—I have heard his wife say she had had a letter from Mike—Brosnan was called Mike—Mason has on those occasions taken the basket away empty and returned with it sometimes full and sometimes not full of yellow soap—he had two baskets which he used to go with—one would hold about half a cwt or a little more and the other about a cwt —Brosnan generally came to Mason s on Sundays—they generally had a glass of something to drink—Mason has been to me a number of times and said Will you lend me half-a-sovereign or a sovereign to pay this man I have done it and he has returned the money to me—I remember a man called Patty being there—he is an Irish-man—Patrick I believe is his right name—he goes by the name of Patty—he has been there a good many times—on one occasion when Patty was there Mason said to his wife Move the soap into the kitchen and don t let Patty know we get any from Wapping —I remember the day on which Mason was apprehended—I watched his house for some time after that and I law the prisoner Brosnan leave the door Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Where was Mason living then A At No 3 Norfolk-street New Cut—I did not lodge with him there—the last place I lodged with him at was No 19 Angel-place before that I lodged with him at No 44 I believe Lant-street Borough and also in Red Cross-street Borough—he kept a chandler s-shop when he lived in Red Cross-street—I was there three weeks and then he moved—no soap came there from Wapping to my knowledge nor to Lant-street to my knowledge—all I saw was at Angel-place—he went to Angel-place on the 5th of March last year and I lodged with him there from that time till about eight weeks ago—he had the whole house and I had furnished apartments in it with my wife and my wife s sister—there were no other lodgers—my wife is since dead—neither my wife or her sister were present at any of the conversations I have mentioned—they occurred in Mason s room down stairs and on Sunday mornings—my wife died on the 27th of May and then I was only a single man lodger—none of these conversations occurred before that—my wife s sister was not lodging there at the time these conversations occurred—I moved into the back-room after my wife s death—no other lodger came to the house not to pay—a female lodged with Mason s wife for one night—I cannot say how soon after May it was that the first conversation about Wapping occurred but I should say not for six weeks or two months—I am perfectly sure of that—it was not on a Sunday that the basket was taken out—I had a great deal of work to do Q What time in the day was the basket taken out after you heard the wife say a letter had come from Wapping A Sometimes I left off work at half-past five o clock—that is our regular hour and about a quarter before six I returned home and I have seen Mason take the basket likewise I have seen him send a young man with a basket to Wapping—it was always in the evening I saw it after I came from work—he was gone about two hours and a half—I have had a quarrel with him—he did not turn me put of the house—I paid my rent honourably every week—he never called in the police to get me out of the house—I swear that—I was never taken into custody by the police by his directions—I have been in custody of the police but was never taken out of that house—he did give me in charge of the police about nine days after I left—it was in the court —he charged me with accusing him of a robbery and an assault—I do not know what he charged me with—I was locked up—he said I had assaulted him—I was in the station-house all night and then went before a Magistrate and was bound over to keep the peace Q Did that make you angry with him A Not a bit of it—do you think I care about 2s —I do not know that he ever made any other charge against me than that Q What was that you said about a robbery A I told you that he had me locked no because I accused him of being a thief or receiving stolen goods and an assault—I did accuse him of receiving stolen goods nine days before he charged me with the assault—he brought an action against me—at least I had a piece of paper Q Had you been locked up in the station-house before you went to Mr Charles A Yes—the action was not brought against me for a fortnight after I went to Mr Charles—I know Messrs Price—Mason did not work for them at the time he sent me to the station—I do not know how long ago he worked for them—I went down there and Mr Price was not at home and I wrote a note to Sir Charles Price—that was before I was put into the station—it was after I had left his lodging—I did not leave the lodging on account of any quarrel—Mr Price came to me in consequence of the note I had written to him—I do not know how soon it was after I left the prisoner s lodgings—it must have been within nine days—he did not continue in Messrs Prices service notwithstanding what I said to Mr Price—he had warning at that time—I have seen Mr Price a good many times—I saw him yesterday Q Do you mean to tell me distinctly on your oath that you have no malice or ill-will against this man for locking you up A No nor any man in this world have I ever had a moment s malice with—I get my living by hard work—I am an engine-smith—I worked for Mr Cisterson of Southwark-bridge for five years—I left him three months ago—I am now working at Mr Nolan s in Guildford-street at the corner of Essex-street in the Borough—I have been in the station three or four times or it may be five times because I sometimes take a little drop too much—I always go to the station for protection—I am never taken by a policeman nor ever fined the penalty—I may have paid 1s —I have never been locked up in gaol for it—I have never been locked up for any thing besides being drunk—stay a minute I will just tell you considering —no I do not think I was ever locked up in my life except it was for a little drop too much—I swear I have never been in any prison or gaol—I am nearly twenty-two years old—I have not been a smith all my life—I formerly worked in a cloth-manufactory in the country—my grandfather was a master clothier—my friends became bank-rupts and I came up to London to seek my fortune—I first went to the Life-Guards to try to get a situation and then turned smith—Eastman was the young man who Mason sometimes sent for the soap—he was in Mason s service some time backwards and forwards—I cannot exactly say how long not a great deal—when Mason could not go himself he used to send Eastman—he did not live in the house—I did not know him before he came to Mason s—I have not been acquainted with him since further than giving him the time of day when we met but not to have any thing to drink with him but once and then Mason and I and he had a drop of something together—I was never in Horsemonger-lane gaol no further than going to see the prisoners and debtors there—I have been into almost all the gaols in London—I was never a prisoner there—I do not believe I was ever confined there for an assault—I have been at the Sessions-house for a drunken assault—I was not taken up last December for an assault on some soldiers JAMES EASTMAN I live at No 8 Tower-street Vauxhall In December last I was in Mason s service—he first employed me to go with him to fetch some soap—we went to Wapping to the back entrance of Mr Charles s premises—when I went with him he left me and I did not see where he went for the soap—I do not know that he went to Mr Charles s then but I know he did go there because I have gone by myself at other times with a note which he has given me to receive soap—when he gave me a note I went to Mr Charles s back premises and knocked—Brosnan opened the door I delivered the note to him and he took my basket and filled it—I received 56lbs of soap each time I went sometimes more and sometimes less—before that I had gone with Mason on various occasions—he has gone away and when he came back he bad a basket full of soap sometimes 1/2 cwt and sometimes 3/4—I delivered the soap which Brosnan gave me to Mason—the 18th of January was the last time I went with a note—I cannot say how many times I had brought soap before that but I had brought it away for about five weeks by myself—I do not know whether the soap I brought on the 18th was marked or not—some of the soap was—I have heard Mason say it was Mr Charles s mark and it was to be cleaned—I cannot read myself or else I could have made it out—it has been cleaned before I delivered it to the shops—by cleaning I suppose he meant the mark was to be cleaned off—I delivered the soap to him and went home and next day perhaps I went to deliver it to the shop-keepers for him—Mason did not keep any shop at that time—I have not said any thing to Brosnan when I have gone for the soap—he has delivered the soap to me and I have delivered to him the money—sometimes half-a-sovereign and sometimes a sovereign—I cannot say what particular money I delivered on the 18th—sometimes they settled between them—I do not know when—I have been to Mason s house sometimes on Sunday but was not in the habit of doing so—I have never seen Brosnan there at all Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q What are you A A labourer—I am not in employ at present through this case or else I should have been—the last master I worked for was Mr Brock a builder about six months ago—I have been working on my own account since—I have had a horse and cart working in the country with fish—I have been tried and convicted and sent to the hulks at Woolwich—that is ten years ago—I did not know till the last week that this was not an honest transaction—I did not know it was a dishonest transaction when I first went—I did not know till lately that the door I went to was a back door—I did not live in that neighbourhood nor did I know the warehouse—I did not know Brosnan before—I went there and handed in a basket and sometimes paid something—I believed it was an honest transaction until the last week Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q You first used to go with Mason A Yes at all hours in the day—I have been at half-past seven o clock in the morning—Mason lived in the Borough when he first employed me I think in Lant-street—that was about three months before last chirstmas—I went with him for about a mouth and then I used to go by myself for about five weeks—the 18th of January was the last time I went—I then left off because I got a job and did not think it worth while going—Mason used to pass to me as a commission-traveller—I have known him nine years—he has only passed as a commission-traveller about two years—before that he kept a shop in Red-cross-street Borough—I do not know of his doing anything else—I used to carry the soap to the shops—Mason used to sell it before he sent me with it—I received the money and carried it back to Mason when I received it—I have taken soap and received the money about twelve times or it may be twenty I do not know—the first house Mason lived in he kept the soap under the stairs in the coal-cellar and in the last house he used to keep it in the kitchen—it was when he lived in Lant street that he first got me to help him—it was about two or three months before Christmas last that it first began with me Q Do you mean that he was living in Lant-street then A No a good bit before that—I do not know exactly how long he has lived in the last house—I cannot call it to mind—I have been to his house in Angel-place on a Sunday—I was never there when Austin was there—I cannot say now whether he ever sent me to fetch soap in Austin s presence—Austin was a single man lodger and he might be up stairs for what I know—I do not recollect that he ever told me in Austin s presence to go and fetch soap—when Mason lived in Angel-place I sometimes went to fetch the soap in the evening—about four or five o clock in the winter time never later than that—I do not know what time Mr Charles s manufactory shuts up—I was never told to mind and be there before the men went away—I have never started from Angel-place later than five I am quite certain of that—Mason would not have employed me to go if he had thought I should be too late—I know Austin by sight—I have drank with him and Mason five or six times I suppose sometimes at Mason s and sometimes out—I do not know that I have ever drank with them on a Sunday—we have drank at two public-houses in the New-cut—I never drank with Austin alone—I drank with him this morning and yesterday—I do not know where he lives—I live in Tower-street and have done so for three years—I have never been taken up except the time I was sent to the hulks—I have my pardon in my pocket and I received 2l when I came away which I should not have done if I bad not behaved myself—I have obtained an honest living for the last nine years—I was not taken in custody on this charge—I have had no conversation with Austin about it—Austin had nothing at all to do with me MR PRENDERGAST Q Were you discharged from the hulks before your time A Yes I only served four years and five months out of seven years—I got out through my good behaviour JAMES FOGG I am an inspector of the Thames-police I apprehended Mason at his house in Norfolk-street Blackfriars-road on the 10th of October—I had been to his house about a dozen times before but was not able to see him—I made an arrangement with his wife not in my police dress and saw him—I then took him and told him that we were come to take him into custody for receiving a quantity of soap belonging to Mr Charles of Wapping from a man who went by the name of Mike who worked for Mr Charles—he said he did not know such a man—I told him he was a tall man with a patch on his eye—he said he knew nothing of him—he was afterwards placed in company with Brosnan at the office—they appeared to know each other then—he spoke to him—Brosnan had previously been apprehended and discharged—in consequence of information on the following Sunday I went on the Friday to Mason s house and saw Brosnan and his wife go into Mason s house remain there some time and then come out again—when I apprehended Mason and told him what it was for he said he knew nothing of it but he knew who bad done it—his wife came in at the time and she said Yes that fellow at the top of the street meaning Austin and Mason said Austin bad done it—Austin s name was mentioned several times by Mason—I told him we had a man named Eastman in custody—he said he knew nothing about him—I asked if he knew him he had been a porter—he said he knew nothing about him Cross-examined by MR CHAMBERS Q Did he not say Austin had towed revenge and he knew who had done it A No I do not think he did—he said nothing about Austin s expressions of revenge towards him—it was not true that Eastman was in custody—I said so to him to know if he knew any thing about it—I told a falsehood JAMES CHRISTOPHER EVANS I was present when Mason was apprehended—Fogg said Don t you know Milk —he said No —I did not hear all that passed—I was searching the room and went out on the landing—after I had done searching the place I sat down waiting for Mrs Mason to come in and I said Well Mason don t you know any thing of Mike —he said Well I know there is such a man but I don t know any thing of him MR CHAMBERS called EDWARD KING I am warehouseman to Messrs Price Mason was in their employ as warehouseman from September 10th 1840 to September 11th 1841 this year—he came at six o clock in the morning precisely and never left till eight in the evening except the hour for dinner—there was no other time allowed for meals during the day—it was my business to be in the warehouse so as to know that he was there—he was the most regular man from his meals that we had on the premises and he bore one of the very best of characters for honesty William Lindsay York-street York-square Commercial-road David Roomey Queen-street Chelsea William Francis Limehouse Henry Aston Charles-street Covent-garden and George William Rider Felix-street Somers town also deposed to Mason s good character BROSNAN— GUILTY Aged 47 MASON— GUILTY Aged 33 Transported for Ten Years First Jury

6s 12 quarts of double stout value 6s and 12 bottles value 3s the goods of Thomas Masterman and John Masterman the masters of Brailey and Brown and that White had been before convicted of felony THOMAS YEOMAN I am a constable of the Thames Police On the morning of the 31st of October I saw the three prisoners come out of Messrs Master mans premises in Broad-street Ratcliff—I live about 200 yards from there in Harris -court—the prisoners passed me at my own door—Brown said to me Good morning we are just going home —Brailey was carrying a basket—I stopped him and found six bottles of stout in this basket four bottles underneath his apron and one in each coat-pocket—the other prisoners went away—I detained Brailey—I after-wards went to White s house—he came home while I was there—I told him what I came for and asked where he had left Brown—he said he had not seen him since Saturday night—I asked him what time he got up in the morning—he said At four o clock for the purpose of going mush-rooming —I then went to Brown s house but did not find him at home—I searched the house and found one bottle with a portion of porter in it—Brown s wife told me she had got the bottle of porter in on Saturday night to drink—I then went to Brailey s house and there found nine bottles of stout seemingly of the same quality as that I found about him—I asked him at the station how he accounted for the bottles I had found in his house—he said he knew nothing about them—I said If you know nothing about them I must take your wife into custody —he then said Well if you must know if I had not taken them there they would not have been there that will do —I found two keys in Brailey s pocket—I asked where he got them from—he said he did not know—I then went to the prosecutors premises knocked the foreman up and found they were the keys of the outer and inner gate of the prosecutors premises—I asked Brailey how he accounted for the keys and he then said Why the keys belong to the brewhouse —I said Are you allowed to keep keys —he said Yes —I afterwards apprehended Brown at the brewhouse—I said Brown I want you respecting this robbery with Brailey of the bottled porter —he said Mr Yeoman I know nothing about it can t you leave me till tomorrow and let me do my work to-night —I said No you must come with me now Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Do you mean that you actually saw the three prisoners come out of the premises A Yes—I was standing at the corner of Harris -court which comes into the street about one hundred yards from Messrs Mastermans gate—I saw them come out of the wicket-gate which is attached to the large gate of the premises—it was about a quarter to five o clock—Brailey told me he was allowed the keys to go into the brewhouse—he had an apron on with a bib to it and the four bottles were in that White I know nothing at all about it he swears falsely Witness I have known the men well for years and cannot be deceived PETER MORESBY I am in the prosecutors employ and live on the premises—I was called up by Yeoman the officer at five o clock on the Sunday morning—I came down and found the wicket-gate open which it ought not to have been—I also found the inner door unlocked and open—Brown had no business on the premises at that time in the morning—He was employed as a labourer in the brewhouse at other times—White is Brown s father-in-law and is a carpenter—he had no business whatever on the premises—I went to White s house and he came in about half-past five—the officer asked if he had seen Brown that night—he said no he had not Cross-examined Q How long has Brailey been in the prosecutors employ A Ten years—he is married and has five children I believe—he had 24s a week—when I spoke to him he seemed much affected and cried a good deal at the station and gave me all the information I asked him for—I always supposed him honest—the coppers on the pre-mises require cleaning but not on Sunday morning—it would not be any part of his duty JOHN M CROW I am bottle foreman to the prosecutor and have charge of the bottled beer—the key of the padlock of the vault ought to have been on a nail outside my counting-house door—I hung it there on the Saturday—on Monday morning I found it in the padlock and the door unlocked—I left the premises about eight o clock on the Saturday—I do not know whether Brown and Brailey were gone then they were not in my department—they could get to where my key was by getting round through the brewery—I found a deficiency in one bin five two five and half-a-dozen—I have tasted the beer found in one of the bottles which the officer took from Brailey and have no doubt it is the same quality as the beer in the bin—a lad named Peter White is employed in my department—he is the prisoner White s son—he had access to the key during the hours of business Cross-examined Q Brailey had not access to the keys I believe A No not without going through the brewery in a way which he ought not—I cannot account for the deficiency from the bin in any way but by the beer being stolen—we enter all we sell in a book—there is no stamp or mark on the bottles or corks THOMAS HARD I am in the prosecutors employ—I went to the brewhouse on the Saturday night and left at a quarter before one o clock on the Sunday morning—when I left I locked the wicket and gate up secure and put the keys into my pocket—they must have been opened by false keys Cross-examined Q Were any of the persons allowed keys to go into the yard of a morning A No only the fortnight men —I am one of them and a man named Patterson is another—I had done the work that evening myself—persons who have to come in in the morning have keys allowed them—I do not know how many have keys—Brailey is allowed keys CHARLES HUSBAND I am managing clerk to Messrs Thomas and John Masterman—they are the only partners—Brailey was one of the persons allowed a key of the wicket gate and middle gate THOMAS YEOMAN re-examined I am certainly correct that I saw the three prisoners come out of the brewhouse for directly opposite the gate there is a gas lamp—I distinctly swear they all three came out of the gate together and passed my door together Cross-examined Q What did you do up at that time in the morning A My duty at that time was to come home at two o clock from the Thames police but I had been attending the fire at the Tower and did not get away from the office till past four—when I saw Brailey going by with the basket I followed him—he walked a little fast before I got to him— I stopped him round another alley and about four hundred yards from Messrs Masterman s premises White s Defence I was not there and the policeman never saw me till half-past six o clock when I came home JOHN SUTTON I am a constable I produce a certificate of White s former conviction which I got from Mr Clark s office—I was present at his former trial in the other court—he is the person described in the certificate—I apprehended him— read Brailey and Brown received good characters BRAILEY— GUILTY Aged 35 BROWN— GUILTY Aged 32 Recommended to mercy Confined Six Month WHITE— GUILTY Aged 58 — Transported for Seven

value 3s 1 bottle value 3s 19 cannisters value 1l 4lbs weight of nutmegs value 30s and 3 weights value 1l the goods of Edward Wilkins his master MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution EDWARD WILKINS I am a wholesale confectioner at 57 and 58 St John-street The prisoner was in my service ten weeks as porter at the time he was apprehended—he had access to the stock mentioned in the indictment and could have taken it—he had been in my employ about two years before for three or four years—I had a very high opinion of him and recommended him to the police force where he obtained a situation—about nine o clock in the evening on the 3rd of December I received a communication from Mr Caulfield my clerk—he showed me some currants in his apron—the prisoner was present—he cried and said it was the first thing he had robbed me of and he had merely taken them for a Christmas-pudding—I gave him into the custody of a policeman—I afterwards Went to the station—the policeman searched him again there and found about half-a-pound more currants in his pocket—his premises were afterwards searched and all the articles stated in the indictment were found all of which I deal in—the currants were in a bag with the mark of one of my country customers on it—I can undertake to say that bag had been in my possession—there was more currants in another bag and the liquorice was in in a paper stamped—I know the lozenges and other things—they belong to me as they are marked with our stamp—I believe all the articles found belong to me—my stock is considerable—I should not be able to miss the articles individually—I should miss them in the whole—my stock has certainly decreased beyond my sales— property produced —when the prisoner was at the station-house he said he lived at No 3 Swan-alley—in consequence of that statement I accompanied the police-officer to No 3 Swan-alley but no such person lived there—I returned to the prisoner and said You don t live at No 3 Swan-alley you had better tell us the truth he then said he lived at No 6 Swan-alley in the middle room—I went to No 6 about half-past ten o clock—I found nothing belonging to me in the middle room—in consequence of inquiries I made there I searched the front room ground-floor and all the articles enumerated were found in that room—we do not deal by retail—we deal in all the articles found and I believe the whole of them to be mine Prisoner It is quite a mistake about a false address I told him No 6 in the first instance and I told him I let the middle room but did not live in it Witness —I am not mistaken—he said he occupied the middle room WILLIAM CAULFIELD I am the prosecutor s clerk I remember the occasion in question which called my attention to the prisoner—I communicated what I saw to the prosecutor and afterwards saw the property which was brought from the prisoner s premises—I was shown two bags—there was pimento or allspice in them then—I know this bag—it had been sent to a country customer and returned—it is my master s property—here is my master s stamp on this liquorice which denotes that it was made at my master s premises—I know this tin—it is used to put goods in and has a label on it printed purposely for us—there is nothing in the tins—they usually contain acidulated drops—we found no acidulated drops—the other articles are such as Mr Wilkins deals in—nothing but the liquorice bears the stamp—we have a great quantity of the tins—here is another bag similar to the one sent to the country customer and returned which belongs to my master—the prisoner was never authorised to take any of these things away nor the bags COURT Q How would the bags be sent back to you from the country A By the same conveyance as they went and be brought from the wharf by porters—our porter would not go for them nor take the goods out Prisoner Q Have you ever sold any of that juice A Of course we have sold some but we do not perhaps send out 25lbs in twelve months—our dealings are very large—our returns are from 40 000l to 50 000l a year—I cannot undertake to swear the juice was never sold—we never sell by the stick nor do I believe we ever sold 2lbs at a time JURY Q Did you have these lozenges during the ten weeks the prisoner was with you A Yes and the acidulated drops and all the other articles—I have no question but that he took these goods oat early in the morning from the time he came in until breakfast-time and at shutting-up time—he shut up the premises in the evening—he would have opportunities of taking the goods packing them up and taking them out COURT Q What was his duty as porter if he did not carry out goods A Cleaning up the warehouse and helping in the manufactory—he took goods out sometimes but since he has been back this time he did not take out many goods—we send out four or five cart-loads of goods in a day—Mr Wilkins lives at No 57—the prisoner would have access to Nos 57 and 58 also—he was not left quite alone in charge of the premises of a morning but he might be an hour or an hour and a half at No 58 alone in the morning—his lodging was about two hundred yards from the premises—I can say that these particular sacks were in our possession within the ten weeks EDWARD WILKINS Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS I have not sold these articles to the prisoner—the allspice has not been sold at all—it is an odd weight—we sell 28lbs or 56lbs —they have not been sold or I should not have found them in his place—I know them by the bags and the papers are marked—I do not swear to the currants but they were found in a bag of mine—we keep them in barrels and in bags—we occasionally send out the bags to customers—we have missed property of this description from our stock but I was not aware so large a quantity was gone—they weigh in all 3cwts and a half WILLIAM JOHN CLARK I am in the prosecutor s service I marked one of the bags produced previous to its going to the country customer about six months ago—it came back about the 1st of September—I have seen it on the premises after the prisoner came back—he came back in September—I can undertake to say the bag was on the premises after that Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How did you take such notice of the bag A I mark very few bags myself but being very busy I marked that previous to its going into the country—it is marked S A —I swear I printed that myself—I have not marked twenty bags COURT Q Do you recollect the fact of doing it A Yes as well as knowing my own writing—I marked it for Mr Scott of Ashford Kent JOHN WATTS I am a policeman I was sent for by the prosecutor—I was present when the prisoner first gave his address No 3 Swan-alley—I am certain of that—in consequence of what he said I went with his master to No 3 and found he did not live there—I made further inquiry and in about three hours returned to the station—I said nothing myself about the address he had given nor did the prosecutor in my presence—I afterwards went with the prosecutor to No 6 and in the front-room ground-floor found the articles produced CATHERINE FIELD I live at No 6 Swan-alley St John-street—the prisoner occupied the parlour which is the front-room ground-floor with his wife and family—that is the room the things were found in —Taylor Surgeon Vine-street Hatton-garden deposed to the prisoner s good character GUILTY Aged 35 — Transported for Seven Years

seven silk and twelve cambric in the name of Mary Welsford Tarling-street for 1l —they are all new—this is the duplicate I gave her—she told roe they were a present from her intended husband—they were folded in this paper—there is a portion of Mr Hopkins s name on it—on the 20th of January the inspector called and saw these articles Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You knew Welsford perfectly well A Yes she had been in the habit of pledging there about six months—I did not exactly know where she lived but I knew where I could find her—she pawned some of these things in the name she was in the habit of pawning in—that is done by persons who are very honest DANIEL DERRIG police-sergeant K 27 In consequence of information from my inspector I went to Mr Carpenter s and examined these duplicates and seeing No 2 Tarling-street on them I went and found Welsford there in a bed-room in the front-parlour—when she saw me she said Oh I thought it was Rickards have you seen him —I said No I have not I came about these handkerchiefs which were pledged at Carpenter s— she said Oh I have got the duplicate of them you can have it if you please —she then gave me these eight duplicates—amongst them was one for the handkerchiefs and the broad-cloth—I said You must come with me —she said I hope not I hope Rickards has not been doing any thing wrong he gave me the handkerchiefs and I pledged them —Mr Peggs came to the station while I was entering the charge against Welsford—up to the time of my taking her to the station she did not produce or deliver to me any thing but the eight duplicates—I went with Mr Peggs to her lodging to the same room in which I found her—I there found a silk dress a piece of new Irish linen four new veils twelve new cambric handkerchiefs a piece of new French cabric three pairs of gloves one pair new and the others appeared to have been worn two collars two new table-cloths some cambric handkerchiefs which have been made up some marked Rickards and some Welsford a volume of the Pirate a black silk handkerchief which has been hemmed but not worn a red merino shawl a bonnet and a wrapper—they were identified by Mr

Shoreditch—Rickards was called into the counting-house by Mr Pegg who charged him in my presence with robbing them to a great extent—I said he must consider himself in my custody and I should take him to Shadwell where a young woman was charged of the name of Welsford—he said I know her —after that he cried and asked Mr Hopkins to forgive him—Mr Hopkins said No I shall do no such thing —I then took Rickards up stairs—he gave me the keys of his drawers—I returned them to him and asked him to unlock the drawers which belonged to him—he did so and Mr Pegg selected from them these two handkerchiefs MARY KEPPELL I live in Tarling-street—I do not keep a house of accommodation Welsford lodged there on the 14th and 18th of January—she has lodged with me nine months—she only occupies the

dress-maker Cross-examined Q You knew nothing of his sleeping there the night before that A No I should not have allowed that to go on in my house—he spoke of marriage repeatedly and it was the general opinion they were to be married—I have seen him at different times make her presents of a dress and some handkerchiefs about four months back—he said it was some stock he had when he was in business at Devonport—the dress was a brown silk one—I believe this to be it—I did not see her receive the dress—she told me he gave it her—I saw him give her the handkerchiefs—he said they were stock he had—I had no reason to disbelieve he had been in business at Davenport—Welsford comes from Exeter and has been respectable and borne a good character—my husband is chief officer of the Runimede and lives with me when he is at home from sea—I do not allow men and women to come to my house—I came from Exeter and Welsford came with me about nine months since—she has been gaining her living honestly MR CLARKSON Q Did you know Rickards was in the service of Hopkins and Peggs A I knew he was in a situation in the draperyline—I did not know where—I have known Welsford four or five years—she is nineteen years old—she has a mother living at Exeter—I brought her to London JAMES PEGGS I am in partnership with Mr John Hopkins—we keep a linen-draper s shop in Shoreditch—Rickard s had been in our employ nearly a month—he came as shop-walker—he had 60l a-year and his board—the articles produced are all ours—they had not been sold to the prisoner—they are worth nearly 12l —I charged Rickards with having robbed us and he asked forgiveness—Mr Hopkin s said he could not do any such thing—this paper is a wrapper of some goods that has borne the stamp of our house—I produce the piece of brass which made the impression—here is enough left to show that it is made from our stamp Cross-examined Q I suppose the whole of these goods could not have been taken at one time A I should say not—the probability is that they were taken at different times—Rickards came from Hertford to us FRANCIS GOETZE I am in the prosecutor s employ These veils are the prosecutor s property—here is part of the shop-ticket on one of them HENRY COX I am in the prosecutor s employ I saw Welsford once at their shop about three weeks before this transaction—I saw her speak to Rickard s at that time ELIAS

t18420404-1326  1326 WILLIAM ANDREWS was indicted for stealing on the 9th of March 100 printed copies of Chambers s Edinburgh Journal value to 4 1/2 d the goods of William Bradbury and another his masters and CHARLES CARTER for feloniously receiving the same well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution FREDERICK MULLETT EVANS I am in partnership with William Bradbury as printers in Whitefriars—ours is the only house in London that prints Chambers s Edinburgh Journal —the prisoner Andrews was our apprentice and acted as a machine-man—there are six machines in the machine-room—Andrews worked at the machine we call No 2—there are two machines close together on the right immediately you go in at the door—when the copies of the journal are taken from the machine they are laid down quite flat on a board by the side on one another—they are then counted up in hundreds and folded over once then taken up into the ware-house to be dried and afterwards distributed to the trade—copies are never sent out to the trade in a wet state and folded but once—they are simply folded so for the purpose of counting in hundreds—Andrews by being in the machine-room would have the opportunity of possessing himself of a hundred numbers of wet sheets folded once—I am not aware at which machine No 528 of the journal was printed—a person named Hall worked at one of the machines side by side with Andrews he at one machine and Andrews at the other—we sell the journal to the trade at 13 1/2 d a dozen—that is the wholesale price—some are sent to the binders and some to the publishers—we fold a portion of them and the others are sent to the binders Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q HOW long has Andrews been in your service A I think between four and five years altogether—he came first as a machine-boy—our superintendent engaged him—we direct that none but persons of good character are to be engaged—he has been an apprentice about two years—we apprenticed him partly in consequence of his good conduct and partly out of compassion to teach him a trade—I understand he lives opposite our establishment in Lombard-street Whitefriars—each machine requires one man and two boys—I entertained a good opinion of Andrews MR CLARKSON Q Have you had any reason for changing that opinion A Yes for some time past I have had a very bad opinion of him indeed THOMAS SELBY I am an apprentice of Messrs Bradbury and Evans I am seventeen years old and have been in the establishment about three years—I live at No 10 Zoar-street Southwark—Andrews was in a different department—on Wednesday evening the 9th of March about half-put seven o clock I was going home in company with Robert M Cauley another apprentice and in Fig Tree-court Temple I saw Andrews about the centre of the court with a round parcel under his arm rolled up and wrapped round with an old brown paper wrapper like this now produced—one end of it was open behind so that I could discern that it contained paper—I believe along the Temple would be the nearest way to Holywell-street from Whitefriars Cross-examined Q Where had you come from A From Regent-street—I was going towards Blackfriars—I know Andrews well—I cannot say how many lights there are in Fig Tree-court—there are not many—I did not speak to Andrews nor did M Cauley—it was dark—I do not undertake to swear this is the wrapper I saw—it was one similar to it MR CLARKSON Q Was there any gas-light in the court A Yes I saw by the light of the gas that the parcel was open behind and contained paper—the white showed from the brown paper f ROBERT M CAULEY I am one of Messrs Bradbury and Evans apprentices I had been with Selby to Regent-street on the 9th of March—on our return home we came into Fig Tree-court about half-past seven and saw Andrews there with a parcel under his arm wrapped in a wrapper like the one produced—it was open at one end and I saw that it was paper—from the appearance of the roll I should say there were about 100 sheets of paper in it Cross-examined Q I suppose you will not swear to the wrapper A No—I cannot swear whether there were twenty-five or fifty sheets CHARLES HALL I reside in Lambeth-square New-cut and am in the prosecutors service—I was working the machine No 2 which prints Chamber s Edinburgh Journal on Wednesday the 9th of March Andrews was working in the same room at one part of the evening—I missed him from the room just after seven o clock—he had something to do with some numbers of Chambers s Journal but not with No 528—I bad that all to myself—he had to pass my work while in the room—I sheets up wet in hundreds and folded once—if he were so disposed be might take them in that state—I never took any to the prisoner Carter s or any where else—I never saw Carter till he was in custody ELIZABETH M ARTHUR I keep a shop in Holywell-street Strand for the sale of weekly publications On Friday evening the 4th of March the prisoner Carter came and asked me if I dealt in Chambers s Journal —I told him no nothing of any consequence I had been for the last three years conducting the business for my brother but our business was large and I did not enter into any other publications—he said if I did he could supply me very largely at 1s a dozen—I asked if they were the right copies—he said Yes and went over and fetched one—I knew that the regular price was 1s 1 1/2 d —he brought one over to me which he left—I said I could not say any thing to it I would look it over as that was not the proper price and the publishing day of that week was over—I told him I would make inquiry among the trade but be would understand that was not the proper price—he said his reason for offering it was he had dealings with a printer that he took a certain quantity and if he did not sell them he took them again and that their dealings together were only in money—he said it would not be worth his while to take them unless I could promise to take 100 dozen or more—next morning Saturday the 5th of March he came to me again—I told him I would make inquiry among the trade during the week—on Wednesday the 9th he again came over during the day—I told him that I had made inquiry among the trade and that they would take them provided the goods were right—I told him I supposed I might depend upon him that they were right and I was to have the quantity named which was 100 dozen—he said Yes —he said I could have them on Wednesday if I pleased—I said Thursday morning was the publishing morning—he said I could have them on Wednesday night if I chose—about half-past ten o clock that night he came and brought with him these 100 copies of Chamber s Journal now produced—I asked him if that was all—he said All to-night —I told him I thought it was a pity if that was all to have mentioned it to me because that was not sufficient to supply one publisher—he said I could have more to-morrow—he did not say how many—no arrangement was made about paying for the 100 dozen on Wednesday—I said You can leave them had I better pay for them now or when you bring the remainder of the quantity stated —he said Very well I will leave them —after he was gone I examined the 100 copies—they were wet and folded once just as they come from the printers—they were not folded as I had seen them in the trade—I left them as they were till the morning—the publishers sent and I refused to sell them—I went to a publisher in the street made inquiry and a communication was consequently made to the prosecutors—on the following morning the witness Humphreys came to me and I delivered to him about a dozen of the copies Carter had left with me—about one o clock the same day Thursday Carter came to me again and said How about Jose Chambers —I said I have done nothing with them they lay here as you left them but as you have not brought any more I shall not think of doing any thing with them —he said The party is at my house now I will make inquiry when you can have any more —he went away returned in about a minute and said I could have another hundred in the evening that he thought that was all I could have that week but I could have as many more as I liked in the following week at the same price—I delivered that same evening to the officer the remainder of the copies Carter had left with me Carter The first time I called on you was on Thursday—I asked whether you did any thing with Chambers s Journal —you said A little but you could say nothing about them unless I showed you a sample and on the Friday I brought you a sample—you said you would ask the trade—I called on Saturday and you said you would take 100 copies Wit ness No for 100 copies would have been of no service to me it was the large quantity you offered which made me suspect they were not stolen—I asked if I could have Chambers s Information also—you said you would inquire—I said one was of no use without the other as they were both sold together Carter I did not deal in weekly publications and came to you for advice I asked you whether they were about the price and you said they were Witness You asked me what they sold at and I told you 1s 1 1/2 d to the trade—you brought them about half-past eight o clock on Wednesday evening—I did not examine them while you remained or count them to see how many there were—I did not say that I had been in the habit of having twenty-six sheets to the quire and these were but twenty-five nor ask if that was the lowest price they would take—you said on the Thursday morning that that was the least you could sell them at as you were allowed so little discount—they were wrapped in one of the set-off sheets—I told you that 100 was of no use to me—I bad not paid you for them Q If they were of no use to you why not give them me back again A You were to bring me the others in the course of the day or the following morning MR CLARKSON Q What business does Carter carry on A I really cannot tell—I have seen books and pictures of various sorts in his shop—he lives nearly opposite me—I had never spoken to him before he came to me to offer these—he did not ask me my advice—he said he had taken them of a man who was a printer that they transacted business together and he owed him money—he came to ask me if I did any thing in Chambers s Journal and what he was to give for them—he said he did not understand much about it and asked what the price was and I told him SAMUEL HUMPHREYS I am chief warehouseman to Messrs Bradbury and Evans In consequence of directions I received from Mr Evans I went to Mrs M Arthur s in Holy well-street on Thursday the 10th of March somewhere between twelve and one o clock in the morning—she showed me a parcel of the journal No 528—they were quite wet apparently as if just from the machine and were rolled up in this sheet of paper which is one of the set-off sheets—that is a sheet which has been through the machine several times—we never allow those sheets to go off the premises in a whole state we always tear them up or destroy them—they are never sold—I have the custody of all the stock of this publication—it is one for which there is a considerable demand—before the weekly numbers go to the trade they must pass through my hands—on Wednesday the 9th of March a portion of No 528 had gone through my hands in sheets to Messrs Orr the publishers and 8500 copies to Mr Bone the folder for the purpose of being delivered by him to Mcssrs Orr the publishers when folded—no others passed through my hands for the purpose of the trade and no others went out of the house to my knowledge—the 8500 copies delivered to Mr Bone were partially dried before they went—the greater portion of them had been on the lines for the purpose of drying Q Could they have been in the state in which those were which you found at M Artburs A According to the time no—those were quite damp as if from the machine—on Thursday evening the 10th of March I went with Beard and Weston the officer to Holywell-street again and watched there for some time about nine o clock I saw Andrews and another—Andrews left the other one outside in Holywell-street and he went into Carter s shop—it is a shop-front with second-hand books candles knives and miscellaneous things in it—the principal stock was second-hand books—there was no name over the door—a board hung at the door stating that miscellaneous property was bought sold or exchanged—I followed Andrews into Carter s—I was close at his heels and Weston was close at my heels—I found Carter in the shop with Andrews—no conversation passed between Andrews and Carter while I was present—Weston said to Carter Have you any Chambers s Edinburgh Journal —he said No I have not —Weston said Did you ever have any —he said No I did not —Weston said You are sure you have not —he said certainly he never did he knew nothing about it—Weston then said Did you ever sell any —he said No I did not —Weston said Did not you sell some to a neighbour —he said No I did not —Weston said I can assure you have or I can prove to you that you have —he immediately sent me across the way to Mrs M Arthur s and I brought Mrs M Arthur s man over with a portion of these—Weston said to the man Who did you purchase these of —the man said That man nodding to Carter—Carter then said Oh yes I did oh yes I did but I sold them on commission —Beard then tapped Andrews on the shoulder and said Andrews what do you do here —he turned round and said Oh I am only come here for a piece of music Mr Beard —Weston then said to Carter Well I shall take this young man for stealing the journal and I shall take you on suspicion of receiving the same and I will search your shop —in searching the shop these two wrappers were found—I said to Beard These are ours George —Carter said Yes they came round the journal —as they were going along to the station he and the policeman were talking together and Carter said It was not this little one— meaning Andrews who had gone on before in custody of another policeman I bought these of but he was with him Cross-examined Q Do you know whether Arnold is partial to music or whether he attends any concerts A I do not know anything about him—Beard is superintendent of the machines—he is also the landlord of a public-house in Fetter-lane—his wife carries on that business I presume as he is in business daily—I never go there—I cannot say whether he gives concerts there—the 8500 copies which went to the binders were not wet they had been hung up in the air for four or five hours and were partially dry—I am sure these had never been done so there are no mould marks on them—I should certainly say these were never on the lines at all—if they had been they would have been more dry—I would not positively swear it—I cannot myself swear that these formed no portion of the 8500—there are about 200 persons employed in the factory—these wrappers are not common pieces of brown paper—they are peculiar wrappers which come from Scotland with the paper—there is no mark on them but we only have that sort of paper in the house which comes from Scotland—I cannot say whether other places have wrappers like them Carter Q Was there any one else in my shop A did not see any one else—a Mr White came in afterwards—I think he was in conversation with you while we were searching the shop—I did not say I think these are our wrappers —I put them on the counter and said to Beard Here George these are ours —you said Yes they came round the journal —I said I know it —these were the only two there—the policeman pulled a lot of rubbish out and said Are any of these yours and I said No —you said There is nothing there belonging to you but you may take them if you think proper GEORGE DUERDIN I am a warehouse lad in the prosecutors printing-office—I came for 5000 copies of the journal No 528 to he sent to Mr Bone—I afterwards counted 3500 more—they were all counted up in quires folded over once and put in bundles of one thousand each THOMAS LAWRENCE I am in the employ of Messrs Orr the publishers of the journal—none of the No 528 went out from our place on Wednesday the 9th of March in an unfolded and wet state as they come from the machine—it is quite impossible—some did go out on the Wednesday folded but none in hundreds half folded and damp Cross-examined Q I suppose you were not at home the whole of the day A No—there are seven or eight persons on the premises—I generally arrive on the premises about nine o clock in the morning and leave at eight at night—I did so that day—I went out to dinner at one o clock—I sometimes have out-door work to do—I cannot say whether I had that day—I will not swear I had not—I was gone about an hour and a half to my dinner—I take my tea on the premises—I am obliged to leave the warehouse occasionally and leave it in the care of other persons MR CLARK SON Q What portion of this publication came to your house on the day in question A We received 10 400 on the Wednesday evening—they were all in a folded state—we never receive them unfolded like these produced by the officer—all that came to us were folded and partially dry WILLIAM THOMAS BONE I am in partnership with my father in Broadway Ludgate-hill On the morning of the 7th of March I received 5000 unfolded copies of No 528 of Chambers s Journal from the prosecutor s—on the 9th I received 3 100 more in an unfolded state—they were all folded before they left our premises—these produced formed no part of them GEORGE BEARD I am a printer I am also a publican but my wife manages that business for me On Wednesday evening the 9th of March I was in the machine-room where it was Andrews s duty to be working—I missed him from the room about ten minutes past seven o clock that evening—he returned about five or ten minutes to eight I cannot say to five minutes—he had no right to be absent without my knowledge—I afterwards accompanied the officer to Holywell-street Cross-examined Q Where does Andrews live A In the same street as the office—he has frequently been absent without my knowledge—I do not know whether he has gone to his father s—he has been at my public-house two or three times—we leave off work at eight o clock at night—Andrews and I never went to my place together—he has come in occasionally of a Saturday evening—that is the only time I ever saw him there—be never drank there with me—I do not give concerts there—we have what the printers term an auxiliary for the benefit of a building-fund for aged printers—we have no music—we have a little harmony—Andrews has sung there—there are no ladies admitted—Andrews s sister has never been there Carter Q What took place when you came to my shop A Weston asked if you had got any Chambers s Edinburgh Journal—you said no—he asked if you ever had any—you said no—he said Are you quite sure you never had any —you said Yes I am —he said Did you never sell any to a neighbour —you said No —Weston said I can prove that you have and he sent over the way to Mrs M Arthur s—a young man who I believe was the shopman came over with this bundle containing four quires—Weston asked him where he bought them—be said Here —he asked who of—he pointed to you and said That man —you then said Oh yes I have sold some but it was only on commission —I swear you said so—I heard nothing else pass between you and anybody else GEORGE WESTON I am a policeman On the Thursday evening I went to Carter s house in Holy well-street—I was in plain clothes—I have heard the account given by Beard of what passed between myself and Carter in the shop—it is quite correct—I received from Mrs M Arthur the four parcels I have produced—they were unfolded just as they are now Carter Q What took place between you and me A When we first came into the shop you asked what I wanted—I said Some Chambers s Edinburgh Journal —you said I have not them —I said Did you ever have any —you said No —I said You are sure of that —you said Yes —I said Did you never sell any of them to any body in the street any of your neighbours —you said No —I said I will prove that you have and told Humphreys to go over the way—they brought the journals and after that you admitted that you had sold them on commission—on our road to the station you said that previous to this Andrews and another had been to your shop and asked you to take some of the Journals that Andrews was not the party who brought them but the other man who came with him Carter s Defence On the 3rd of March a young man came into my shop and asked if I dealt in weekly publications I said I did not and asked what publications they were he said Chambers Edinburgh Journal I said I did not do anything in it myself but I would make inquiry I asked where he lived he said in Water-lane Fleet-street I said if he brought me a sample I would inquire in our street of the publishers who lived there whether they would like to purchase them—on the Friday I went over to Mrs M Arthur and asked her if she dealt in Chambers Journal she said she had done a little I said a party had offered to supply me with them at 1s a dozen and asked her if that was the price—said that was about the price as far as the could recollect I asked if she would like to make a purchase of some she said she could not say till she asked her customers she asked me if they were the right sort I said I was not aware I would get her one I went and fetched one to show her she said they were right and what she had been in the habit of having before nothing more passed till Saturday when I called over and asked if she had asked her customers she said she had and they were all supplied with journals for that week but the following week she would have some of me on Monday I went again and asked if she bad made up her mind she said she had she would have some and would let me know how many I went over on Wednesday morning she said she would take one hundred journals and asked me if that was the lowest price I said I believed it was but I would inquire I directly went over to the young man who was then at my shop to make inquiries he said that was the lowest I was to have 6d a hundred for selling them she gave me an order for one hundred on Wednesday evening about ten o clock the journals came wrapped in a piece of printed paper I said It is late I thought you were not coming he said The wetness of the night prevented my coming before I took them over to Mrs M Arthur she never objected to the quantity she asked how many there were in a quire I said I could not tell she counted and said there was twenty-five which was one less than she generally had in the trade she counted them all over I said There is one hundred and seven and the odd seven will do to make up she asked if she should pay me that night or next morning or give me a note of hand for it I said there was no occasion for that knowing her to be a neighbour next morning the young man called to know if I wanted any more I went over and asked Mrs M Arthur she said she should like to hare another hundred and she would pay me when the other hundred was brought she sent over in the afternoon to see if they had come I said I had not seen the young man I went to find his address but was unable to do so and could not procure her the other hundred nothing more passed till the policeman came and asked if I had any Chambers Journals I said No he asked if I had ever sold any I said No he asked if I had had any I said I have had some I have not sold any I have merely sent over the way to sell on commission he sent the young man over the way and fetched some over I said there was no occasion for him to fetch them I knew there were some there he directly said What does this young man do in the shop I said he came to buy some music Mr Beard then spoke to him and while he was doing so Mr White a printer living in the street came into the shop he said This is a bad job especially for a neighbour it was through me it was found out and Mrs M Arthur says it was through her that it was found out Mr White asked the policeman if he was at liberty to speak to me he said Certainly Mr White asked me if I knew the party who brought the journals I said I should do so and if they only waited a little longer I had no doubt the party I had the others of would be there that night but on account of our going to the station I never saw the party—as we were going to the station the policeman asked me what sort of a young man it was I said he was taller than Andrews he asked whether he had whiskers and how he was dressed I stated as well as I recollected only seeing him once or twice I did not say Andrews had been in the habit of coming with him I said one evening while the young man was in the shop Andrews came in he was only in the shop a few minutes but before he left he did speak to him and I thought by that he might know him if it had not been for what Mrs M Arthur said to me I should have had nothing to do with the journals it was through her advice that I had anything at all to do with them Thomas Sim gave Carter a good character ANDREWS— GUILTY Aged 20

t18420509-1436  1436 JOHN AMOS was indicted for stealing on the 22nd of April 97 1/2 yards of silk value 13l the goods of Wynn Ellis and others his masters and JOHN ELLIS for feloniously receiving the same well knowing it to have been stolen against the Statute &c MESSRS PHILLIPS and CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution JOHN DEAR City police-constable No 279 On Friday morning the 22nd of April I was with Death in Warwick-lane—I know the prisoners by seeing them together for three mornings previous to Friday the 22nd—on Friday the 22nd I saw them together about a quarter past eight o clock in the morning in Warwick-lane—I saw them pass each other in Ave Maria-lane—they joined each other in Warwick-lane—Ellis went first towards Newgate-street and Amos followed him—I saw Ellis turn round several times—I saw Amos go into the Jolly Butchers public-house—Ellis followed him—I ran behind a cart got to the door and peeped through an opening in the door and saw them both standing by the bar side by side—they each had something to drink—while I was looking in I saw Amos put his hand towards the inside of his pocket and hand a parcel to Ellis—I did not see what it was—I saw the motion of it—I am quite sure I saw something pass—when Ellis went in he had nothing in his pocket and when he came out his pocket was bulky—when Amos went in his left-hand pocket was bulky and when he came out there was nothing in it—they remained at the Jolly Butchers three or four minutes—I afterwards accompanied sergeant Death to Amos s lodgings—he gave his address at the station Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Could you see quite plainly through the crack in the door A Yes—it was more than two inches open—the prisoners were standing in front of the bar—Mr Weston was serving them and his daughter was there—I staid there till I saw them moving to come out—I know a man named Owen a butcher—I asked him when I ran to the door if the men were not gone in again—he stood at the door by my side—I did not ask him to go in—he did not move from outside the door—the door was strapped partly back by a strap behind and that gave a kind of opening between the two doors and the door-post—any body could distinctly see the bar—they were swing doors—the space was between the door and the door-post where the hinges are—I may have improperly called it a crack—any body could see into the bar if they stooped down as I did—Owen saw me do it Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Warwick-lane comes out of Newgate-market does it not A Yes—the first time I saw Ellis that morning was in Warwick-lane coming from Newgate-street—I was stationed in a bricklayer s shed in Warwick-lane—I saw Ellis a very little way down the lane going towards Ludgate-hill in a direction which leads to the prosecutor s premises—he bad got half-way down the lane before Amos made his appearance—I should say he was more than a minute s walk from the prosecutor s MR PHILLIPS Q Do you know the prosecutor s shop A Yes—I saw the prisoners join about fifty or sixty yards from the prosecutor s shop—they kept stopping and looking round OLIVER DEATH I am a City police-sergeant On Friday morning the 22nd of April I placed myself in a shop in Warwick-lane—I saw Ellis go down towards Ludgate-hill and about five minutes afterwards I saw him come back again and Amos about three or four paces behind him—they both came back together went round by Warwick-square and went into the Jolly Butchers public-house in Warwick-lane—they staid there four or five minutes—I saw them come out—Dear was with me—I gave him some instructions—the prisoners separated—I watched Ellis—he went towards the new market—I followed him into the market—when he came out of the Jolly Butchers I observed that his pocket was bulky and he carried his hand under his coat—I was in plain clothes—I went up to him and told him I wanted to have a few words with him—he said Very well —I took him through the market—he asked me where I was going to take him to—I said to the Smithfield station—he asked me what for—I said I would not tell him then—I did not tell him I was an officer till I got him to the station—I then asked what he had got about him—he said what he had got was his own—I searched him and found in his right-hand pocket this roll of silk—it had no paper or any covering round it—any body must have seen it was silk—I asked where he had got it—he said he had bought it of a man—I asked what man—he said he should not tell me he bought it and paid for it—he gave his name John Ellis—I asked him for his address—he hesitated a moment and then said he had several addresses—he would not give one—Dear came to the station while I was there—we left Ellis there and went to the prosecutor s—Amos was cleaning the brass-plate at the door—I told him to come inside I wanted to speak to him—I did not tell him why—I took him in and took him up stairs—I asked him if he knew Ellis—he said no he knew nothing about him—I asked him if he knew any thing about the silk—he said no he knew nothing about it—I did not say any thing more to him till after I had seen one of the firm—I then searched him in the shop—I told one of the firm in his presence that we had reason to believe Amos had been robbing them that I had taken a piece of black silk from a roan named Ellis and we had a suspicion that it was taken by Amos to Ellis as we had seen them together two or three different times—Amos said he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station—he gave his address there No 8 New-street Finsbury—I went there and searched the first-floor front-room and found a pair of blankets two quilts two pieces of bed-furniture five sheets two pieces of brown-holland which I think are new one toilet-cover three table-covers and one pair of gloves—I afterwards went to Ellis s lodgings—we found some keys on him and one of the keys opened the door—I found there 34l in gold and 35l in Bank-notes—I heard Ellis afterwards say he lived at the White Horse public-house Cripplegate which was the place where I found this money Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You have kept all these articles you took from Amos A I have—there was some sealing-wax and a broomstick without a handle—I took whatever I found—I could not tell that the broomstick was not part of the prosecutor s stock—I did not strip the room of every thing that was in it—I left boxes and tables behind—when I took Amos I said to him I had come to take him on suspicion of a felony for a piece of black silk—he said he knew nothing about it—I then asked if he knew Jack Ellis—I believe I said John Ellis yes it was John—I was never at this bar—I stood in the other Court once—I stood there as an innocent man and was acquitted after fourteen witnesses had been examined—the Grand Jury found a bill against me for perjury but they could not prove it—I have known Dear three years—I have been on the division nine or eleven months and he has been under me about eight months—I do not live with him—I never lived with him in the same house or in the same lodging—I live in Furnival s Inn-court Holborn—if Dear has sworn we have lived together it is a mistake altogether—I was with Dear when I saw Amos go into the Jolly Butchers—after we had taken Ellis Dear and I had no talk about this any more than when I passed him I told him to watch the porter—when he came to the station he told me where Amos had gone—he stated at the station in presence of Walter Joy the station-clerk that he had looked through the door and saw something pass from Amos s pocket to Ellis but he could not say what it was—I have seen the door many times in passing—it is strapped back and it leaves a crevice between the door and door-post near the hinges—I have seen through the crack where the hinges are—I looked through afterwards—it is not necessary to stoop down to do so—you can distinctly see in front of the bar standing up but not round it—I have only been up to the crack once myself—that was after the prisoners were committed—Dear was not with me at the time—I went through curiosity—I had no reason to disbelieve Dear—as I went by I looked through—I saw Dear go to the door—I did not see him the whole time he was there—they are half glass doors and if you stand upright persons inside the bar can see you—I afterwards stooped down to look and was able to see towards the left-hand in the bar—I know Weston the landlord Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q How long after you saw Ellis go towards Ludgate-hill did you see the prisoners together A About four or five minutes—I did not continue in the same place—I was near Newgate-street when I saw them together—I was walking up and down—I was in plain clothes—I had my police trousers on—I had not got my police coat on—every one might not know I was a policeman—Amos first went into the Jolly Butchers—Ellis was about three or four yards from him—Dear was in the lane near the Jolly Butchers walking in the same direction as Ellis—I was only the width of the street from the Jolly Butchers after they went in—it is a very narrow street—I was only once in the house and that was after the prisoners were committed—Dear was with me then MR PHILLIPS Q You state you were acquitted on this charge of perjury A Yes I was in the City police at that time—I have been three or four years in the City police—the Corporation were aware of my trial—I have been continued in the police ever since and received the expenses of the trial from the Corporation of the City ROBERT CLARK I carry on business on my own account at Worcester I was formerly in the service of Messrs Wynn Ellis and Mr Everington—there are three partners—on the 22nd of April last my department was at the Manchester silk counter—that counter is close to the door in St Paul s Churchyard—Amos was at that time one of the porters—there were some piles of silk in the piece called Gross de Naples on the counter close by the door—it is the practice of the house to mark goods of that kind in pencil—this piece of silk produced is marked No 19 —it is Messrs Ellis and Everington s property—there are 97 1/2 yards of it—it is not an entire piece by about ten or twelve yards—it has been cut which as well as the mark enables me to identify it—if it had been sold it would have passed through the books in account—I have examined to see if it has done so and it has not—there is no such thing—the books are here—it is a very unusual thing for a wholesale house to have a piece cut off—I cannot tell when the piece was cut off—there is a small green mark on the silk which I recollect very well—every entire piece of goods that comes to our place has the manufacturer s ticket on it—the usual length of an entire piece it from 108 to 112 yards—there has been about as much as would amount to a dress taken from it—I have since examined the goods in the warehouse for the purpose of finding the piece from whence the dress was cat off—I have not been able to find it Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How many persons are there in the prosecutors employ A About 100 generally—I do not recollect cutting the dress off myself—I know it is cut off by its not having the manufacturer s fag—there is always a white selvage at the end of an entire piece—there are four persons who dispose of property of this kind without my knowing any thing about it John Newport painter

aunt Mary Craddock in Kent-street Borough On Saturday the 2nd of April all the four prisoners came to our house together—I saw the younger Cochrane take some blue cloth out of the waistband of his

time A Yes—I cannot point out the blue cloth which the younger Cochrane took from his trowsers—as I was coming through there was some cloth on the form—he sat down on it and was doing up his trowsers—I do not know what the name of the policeman is who spoke to me just now—perhaps I might hear his name—we have not been in conversation before to day—he is no acquaintance of mine—my aunt

particular way—it was folded up—I do not know who brought the police to the house—I told my uncle about it—I did not hear what the policeman said to me just now—he took hold of my frock—I do not know what he said—he gave me a little touch THOMAS TURVEY police-constable M 196 In consequence of information I went to Mr Hay s premises with Bovis—she stopped in the street while I went in and saw Mr Hay—the three male prisoners came in—I followed them when they went out to the coffee-house where Bovis lives—they had something bulky with them—I remained outside in the street—I did not stop them then as I had no assistance—soon after Catherine came out with a large bundle under her arm—I followed her into Mint-street—I know she had nothing when she went into the coffee-shop Cross-examined Q Who gave you the information that took you to Mr Hay s house A Mrs Craddock the landlady of the coffee-shop on Thursday the 7th—Bovis was there—that was before I saw either of the prisoners there—I never had any acquaintance with Mrs Craddock at all—I was never in the house before—I had seen Bovis many times in Mrs Craddock s house—I do not know how long I have known Bovis—I have been on that beat two months and I have seen her most days—I never spoke to her in my life—I did not know her name was Susan till the Friday—I do not know that I ever met her in the street—I may have met her but I never took any notice of her—I mean to swear that—I spoke to her when she was in the witness box—I told her she was speaking of a former occasion and told her to confine herself to the 7th—I am quite sure that was all I said—I did not take hold of her by the arm at all—I neither pulled or touched her—I am married THOMAS SWAIN police-constable M 106 I went into the cutting-room after Mr Farlam—I

knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c MESSRS BODKIN and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution JOHN GURNET I keep the Mackworth Arms Commercial-road Lock was in my employ as barman from the 15th of July 1341 till he was taken into custody—on the 26th of Sept in consequence of mformatian I applied to Argent a policeman and gave him thirty shillings sixteen sixpences thirty pence and sixty halfpence which he marked and returned to me and at twenty minutes to eight o clock in the evening I deposited them in the different divisions of the till nearest to Lock taking out all the other money—I remained at the bar about ten minutes then left and my housekeeper who was there left also—every body concerned in business left except one of my young men—I saw Pipe who made an arrangement with me—I came back about eight and found Webber in custody and one penny piece and two halfpence found on him—I can positively swear to one of the halfpence as being one I had put into the till that night—Walker afterwards returned with three penny pieces and a halfpenny—Webber was in the habit of coming to my bouse Cross-examined by MR WILDE Q you do a pretty large business A Yes—there were other tills which Lock could get to ALLEN PIPE I am a policeman On the 26th of September in consequence of suspicions I was at Mr Gurney s in plain clothes—I went at twenty minutes to eight o clock—Mr Gurney and his housekeeper were then in the bar—he left in about ten minutes—Lock was in the bar near the beer-engine—as soon as Mr Gurney left I saw a man come in and go behind the beer-engine which is quite at the further end of the bar—the engine was between him and Lock—I did not know that man—he asked for a pint of half-and-half which Lock served—he did not pay him then—Lock served two other customers—the housekeeper then left the bar—the man drank part of the beer and when the housekeeper left he tendered a small piece of money a fourpenny or sixpenny-piece the

near him took out about 3d in halfpence with his right band and placed them in his left—he then dipped further back into the till and took out two or three shillings—I saw shillings distinctly—he placed them on the top of the halfpence in his left hand then took out more halfpence and placed them over the shillings without counting them—he went and handed them over the engine to the man turned round and said All right —the man then finished his half-and-half and walked out keeping the money in his hand—I went after him—he turned towards Whitechapel and in passing along seemed to be counting what was in his hand—he crossed over to Essex-street—I saw him again and Webber there—they passed down Essex-street within a few paces of each other—when I first saw Webber he was walking in Essex-street rather from Mr Gurney s on the opposite side—they met in Essex-street and passed down—I was not near enough to hear them speak—I saw Walton at the corner of Essex-street—it was so dark there I could scarcely see where they went to—Walton followed them and seized Webber and took him to Gurney s—the other man escaped—I went back to Essex-street with a light in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour and on looking about picked up a halfpenny and a shilling—Webber had not been in the house while I was there—I assisted in taking Webber to the station—he said three or four time she had not been at Mr Gurney s that day Cross-examined Q Where were you placed A Near the engine about two feet and a half from the till—I was not concealed I was about three feet from the man who got change—the till was opposite me—I could see where the halfpence were but not where the silver was—I saw the motion of his hand—I was ten or twelve yards from the man in the street but at his side at the bar MR BODKIN Q YOU stood where customers are A 2Yes—I saw Lock s hand move when he put it into the back part of the till and before that among the halfpence JAMES WALTON I am a policeman I was directed by Mr Gurney to watch his premises on the 26th of September—I stood at the top of Essex-street leading into the Commercial-road in plain clothes—I saw a man come out of Gurney s house and go towards Whitechapel he crossed over towards where I stood—I saw Webber come up to him and join him—I had seen Webber before walking backwards and forwards between Essex-street and the Commercial-road forty or fifty yards—he joined the man at the corner of Essex-street—they spoke to each other and walked down Essex-street—I followed and seized Webber—he then threw his hands out away from him and something fell which sounded like money—the other man was gone in a moment—I brought Webber back to the house searched him and found one penny piece and two halfpence on him which I produce—I went back to the spot and found three penny pieces a halfpenny two keys and a knife—he claimed the knife and keys—when I seized him I told him I wanted him for robbery—he said Oh very well I hare done no robbery JESSE TROWER I am a policeman On the 26th of September I was stationed in Essex-street in plain clothes—Webber with another passed by where I stood—I saw something which rattled like money pass from one to the other and at that time one said to the other That is all Bill gave me to-night —I cannot say which said so—Walton came and seised Webber immediately and I heard something rattle as if money fell on the stones—he was taken to Mr Gurney s MR GURNEY I know this penny-piece and two halfpence—Webber was not at my house after I put the money into the till ARGENT I am a policeman I marked some money on the 26th of September—this is one of the halfpence I marked and this penny-piece and this other—they are what I handed over to Mr Gurney—I was before the Magistrate when the prisoners made a statement—this is Mr Henry the Magistrate s writing— read — Lock says The witness Pipe has sworn falsely in saying that I gave the man money I have been imprisoned a month innocently no man can say I was ever seen in the company of Webber I have known him some time by coming to Mr Gurney s I served him the Monday night before we were taken —Webber says I have nothing to say only that all I ever had at Mr Gurney s I paid for I was not in Mr Gurney s at the time of the robbery I was in Mr Gurney s five minutes before seven I was very cold and had been to Blackwall all I had in the world was a fourpenny-piece and I paid 2d when I had got down Essex-street about twenty yards I went into a corner to make water I had scarcely done that and had my hands in my pockets when Walton seized me and in snatching my hands out I must have pulled out the keys and knife I did not know till after I was in Mr Gurney s parlour that I had dropped the things it was five minutes to eight and not seven that I was at Mr Gurney s I mean it was nearer eight than seven Lock s Defence On the 26th of September last as I was serving at the bar a man named Emery a law writer and cousin of Webber s was employed by him to come to me to ask me for some money this was the third time of my seeing this man that Webber represented to be his cousin he tendered to me a sixpence and I gave him in exchange 2s in silver and six pennyworth of halfpence Webber was in the habit of coming about twice a-week as he used to go to some other place where I do not know for the last four months The first time I ever saw Webber it was at my brother s house I believe that it was only twice I saw him there one evening as my brother was there he Webber came in be waited some time after my brother was gone what my brother had he always paid for He Webber stated to me if I did not give him some money he would inform Mr Gurney that I was robbing him he called in several times before I gave him any thing at last he said I will do it for you to-morrow meaning he would inform Mr Gurney I said to him You are a lying false man to say what you have he said It is all very well for you to say so —at last I consented to his wishes foolishly not knowing the character of the man as I do now or I should have informed Mr Gurney of it The first time I gave money it was 1s and at other times not so much he would ever scarcely go away before I gave him some money he has had on the average about 2s or 3s a-week sometimes he did not come for a week or so whatever I gave him he always kept himself I never had a farthing of him respecting my keeping it a secret on the part of my brother was Mr Gurney had a very great objection to have any person to see you as yon know in business Webber has said to me many times if some persons were in my situation they would have 1l per day and he said I was a fool that I did not as I should be considered quite as much of by the Gurneys as if I did not take a farthing I can make a declaration before the Almighty that I have never taken one farthing from Mr Gamey the whole time I was with him for my own pocket neither for any one else but Webber by his own confession to me he has not done any work for the last four years LOCK— GUILTY Aged 29 — Confined Three Months WEBBER— GUILTY Aged 30 — Transported for Seven Years It was subsequently deposed that

t18430130-717  717 THOMAS FENN was indicted for stealing on the 24th of Dec 236 lbs weight of indigo value 68l the goods of Mary Ann Vestey his mistress —2nd COUNT stating them to be the goods of Samuel Levi Bensunan and others MESSRS BODKIN conducted the Prosecution THOMAS WILLIAM RUDD I am foreman to Mrs Mary Ann Vestey a van and cart holder—the prisoner was in her employ as carman from four to five months On the 24th of Dec directions were given from Bensunan and Co to remove a chest of indigo—I spoke to the prisoner about it and gave him the warrant to go and pay the charges—it was his duty to go to Crutched-friars to pay the charges—I sent him that day about half-past nine o clock in the morning—our place is a quarter of a mile from Crutched-friars—they are the ware-houses of the East and West India Dock Company—he came back in about half-an-hour and told me he had paid the charge—he brought me a receipt for the money he bad paid amounting to about 5s 6d —I then gave him a shipping note this was from half-past ten to eleven—I directed him to go with the note and convey in his cart this chest of indigo from this warehouse to the warehouse in St Katherine s Dock—it was a one-horse van—the way to go from Crutched-friars to St Katherine s Dock would be up John-street down the Minories and across Tower-hill—it would take about twenty minutes—there is a rule which the prisoner knew that we should go the most direct road from one place to another—he returned after one o clock in the day to the stand in Billiter-street—I questioned him as to the time he had been gone—he said he had had his horse down—I looked and saw both his knees were cut—there is a Mr Cobley who assists in managing Mrs Vestey s business—I heard him and the prisoner in the stable in the evening—I heard the prisoner say That chest was all right —I said if it was he should go with me down to the Docks on Monday morning to see that it was right— 1 had received instructions before that —he came home rather later than the other men and did not receive his wages—he was told it was in consequence of the suspicion that the chest was not right—it was bis duty to come on a Sunday about eight in the morning to look to his horses—he did not come at all on Sunday—it was bis duty to come on Monday at six—he did not come on Monday at all—he was taken into custody on Monday—I saw him in the evening—I went on Monday morning with Mrs Vestey to St Katherine s Docks and saw the chest—the bottom part of it was opened and it contained nothing but coal and rags Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Is it the custom for Mrs Vestey to carry other goods besides bonded goods A Yes—we dare not carry bonded and unbonded goods together—bonded goods must go by themselves—the carman generally go the nearest way—we should always expect them to do so WILLIAM COBLEY I assist Mrs Vestey in her business On the 24th of Dec I had information given to me by a gentleman named Hillson—who carries on the same business as Mrs Vestey—in consequence of that information I asked the prisoner on this Saturday evening whether he had been in Rosemary-lane that day with his van and a chest of indigo—he said he had not it was false the chest he had from the Company s warehouse he went down John-street and right down the Minories to St Katherine s Docks with—I afterwards told him he would not have his wages that night I suspected there was something wrong in that chest of indigo by his being in Rosemary-lane out of his road—he said it was very hard he could not have his wages—I said he could not there was some suspicion that the chest was not right—I told him to come on Monday and go down with Mrs Vestey and Mr Rudd to see the chest opened and if it was all right he would be paid—he did not come on Sunday or Monday—on Monday Mr Rudd and Mrs Vestey went down to the warehouse Cross-examined Q Did you say he was to come to Mrs Vestey s on the Monday A No—Mrs Vestey has eighteen carmen—I do not know whether we had been currying indigo shortly before this time—the prisoner ad been in her service about eighteen months—his horse s knees were cut and one leg was broken—the cart was not broken at all MARY ANN VESTEY I am a widow—the prisoner was in my employ On Monday morning the 26th of Dec I went to the St Katherine s Docks—the indigo-chest was opened at the bottom in my presence and found to contain coals and rubbish WILLIAM HARVEY I am a cooper in St Katherine s Docks On Monday morning the 26th of Dec I opened the chest of indigo at the bottom in the presence of Mrs Vestey Cross-examined Q What time was it you opened it A About half-past nine o clock in the morning—it was not ten—I should say it was soon after nine—I have opened several indigo-chests after they have come for shipment—I never brought any coals and rags from any other chest JAMES GEORGE CLARK I am a clerk in the indigo-warehouse of the East and West India Dock Company I remember this warrant— looking at one —being brought on the 24th of Dec by the prisoner before ten o clock in the morning—he came to pay the charges which were somewhere about 5s 6d —this bill of charges is Mr Brown s making out—it refers to this chest of indigo—I handed it to the prisoner with another bill and he would have to go to another officer to pay the charges—here is the receipt for the charges which indicates that they have been paid to Mr Campbell—I should then issue a warrant to Mr Eyre the foreman of the indigo warehouse—this chest was in bond—I do not know at what time the prisoner left—I do not remember his taking the chest from the warehouse—I remember him JAMES AYRE I am foreman of the indigo-warehouse of the East and West India Dock warehouse in Crutched-friars This order was brought to me by one of the messengers of the Dock Company from the office on the 24th of Dec —I gave directions to a person to hoop and cooper the chest of indigo to which that refers for delivery—I saw the prisoner at the warehouse that morning between ten and eleven o clock—he had his van with him—I asked him what he wanted—he said A chest of indigo —I asked who for—he said Bensunan and Co —I said How many —he said One chest —with the assistance of Barker I put the chest into the van and saw him drive out of the yard between half past ten and eleven—in July last it was my duty to attend a gentleman where this chest was on show—it then contained indigo and was kept on the ground-floor in a conspicuous place—the lid was nailed down with three hoops and the warehouse is kept locked with two keys one of the Company s and one of the customer s and they cannot be opened unless both are present—this cask was in bond Cross-examined Q This was in a conspicuous part of the warehouse A Yes on the ground-floor nearly opposite the warehouse-door—I had not seen the indigo since the 15th of July—I do not keep either of the keys—I know the warehouse is open every day from morning to evening—it is locked in the evening when the business of the day is at an end and locked by two officers who come again in the morning to open it—there are always some persons there—we seldom have less than fifty hands there MR BODKIN Q Is there any lodge or place where each person going in and out of the warehouse is noticed A There is a gate and gate-keeper—this quantity of indigo would be a considerable bulk JOHN HAREWOOD I am a labourer in the East and West India Dock warehouse and live in Cornwall-road I remember a chest of indigo being moved away the day before Christmas-day—on the 15th of November I had sampled that chest—it then contained entirely indigo—on the 24th of Dec I received an order to get the chest out to case it for the purpose of being removed—I took it out of the delivery-pile and cased it with gunny-cloth and hooped it round with three hoops—it appeared to me to be in the same state as when I sampled it on the 15th of Nov —I had nailed it up directly I sampled it and on the 24th of Dec it appeared just as I had left it—on Monday the 26th of Dec I was taken down to St Katherine s Docks ware-house and was shown the same chest—it was opened at the bottom—my attention was directed to my own packing at the top—I observed that the head had been taken out and nailed down with a different nail to what I put in it—I observed where the marks of a chisel or jemmy had been inserted between the new wood—the cramp at the head had been moved and had been nailed down with a different nail to what I had used Cross-examined Q Did you not observe the cramp on the 24th A Yes and the cut of the chest—when I cased it I observed no difference in the state of the cask on the 24th to what it was on the 15th of Nov —there were some extra labourers there on the 24th—I had opened the lid to sample it with a chisel—I took the lid partly off and drew the nails—the lid consisted of two pieces of wood as far as my recollection goes—sometimes the lid is in one piece and sometimes two pieces—sometimes we split the lid when we sample it if it is nailed tight—as far as I can recollect this was nailed in the usual way—I saw the marks of a chisel on the 26th inside the new wood MR BODKIN Q How do you distinguish the marks you detected on the 26th from those you made on the 15th of Nov A When I sampled it I took the lid off and threw it back and it is here where I observed the difference inserted in this new wood— looking at it —that is a part where I did not open it and here is a nail which I had not put in it—it appeared to me that it had been opened since the 24th—this is the cramp which had been nailed with a different nail WILLIAM BARKER I marked the export mark on the chest on the 24th of Dec —I lock the warehouse every night and open it every morning—there are two different locks on it—the Custom-house locker has to open the other lock—I assisted in putting this chest into the van after it was done up—I saw it afterwards—I know by the mark that it is the same chest GEORGE HATFIELD I am foreman of the export-dock in St Katharine s Docks I was in attendance there on Saturday the 24th of Dec —I remember the prisoner coming with a chest which I supposed to be indigo—it was some time after twelve o clock I cannot say how long—I received the chest and deposited it in the proper warehouse—I attended to the locking of that warehouse on that Saturday night and I left the chest there as the prisoner delivered it to me—I opened that warehouse on the Monday—it was under my charge till it was opened that morning—I was present when the contents of the chest were first seen JAMES HILSON I am a town-carman and live in Whitechapel On Saturday the 24th of Dec about one o clock I was in Rosemary-lane which is on the eastern side of the Minories—I know Mrs Vestey—she is in the same business as I am—I saw a van of hers in Rosemary-lane—I do not know who was driving it—it contained a chest of indigo—it was going towards the Minories drawn by one horse—there was a carman with it—I am sure it was one of Mrs Vestey s vans—Rosemary-lane is out of the way from Crutched-friars to St Katharine s Docks—it struck me as being something remarkable and I made a communication to Mrs Vestey within five minutes Cross-examined Q How far is Rosemary-lane from the Minories A The part I saw the van in is about 300 yards from the Minories—if I were going down the Minories to St Katherine s Docks I should pass the end of Rosemary-lane—I was going home to my dinner—there is a turning out of Rosemary-lane which leads to St Katherine Docks but it is no thoroughfare for carts JOHN CASPER GEILS I am a master carman and live in Breezers-hill Ratcliff-highway I was in Rosemary-lane on the 24th of Dec about one o clock—one of Vestey s vans met me—it had one horse—it contained a package something similar to this package which is here—the prisoner was driving it towards Sparrow-corner—that would be coming into the Minories JOHN WILLIAMS I was in St Katherine s Docks on Saturday the 24th of Dec between one and two o clock—I saw the prisoner back a van in containing a chest Cross-examined Q What are you A A labourer in the docks—I go to dinner at twelve o clock MICHAEL MAYHEW police-constable H 79 I took the prisoner at the Lee Hoy in Mile-end New Town about a mile from St Katherine s Docks about a quarter to one o clock on the 26th of Dec —I told him it was about a chest of indigo—he said he knew nothing about it Cross-examined Q How came you to go there A I was told by Cobley that he was there CHARLES ROBERT ESSEX I am clerk to Mr Samuel Levi Bensunan and two others They were the proprietors of this indigo—it was in the East and West India warehouse in Crutched-friars—this is the warrant relating to it MR BODKIN to MRS VESTEY Q Are you in partnership with anybody A No—I was in partnership with Mr Cobley some years ago and continued so for several years—I think it was in 1832 we dissolved but Mr Cobley did not leave my premises—he has conducted my business ever since—I cannot say that he ever left—we did not agree and he said we had better dissolve partnership altogether and so we did and it was in the Gazette —here is one of my cards—Mr Cobley lives on the premises—it is his own house—at least the lease is in his name—I pay the rent and all the taxes—I do not pay the rent to him—the business is mine Prisoner s Defence As I received the chest from the warehouse so I delivered it at St Katherine s Docks I am innocent of what I am charged with GUILTY Aged 24 — Transported for Seven Years

the name of Stereker box on it—I wrote on it Budge-row according to the direction on the parcel Cross-examined Q Did you see the box yourself A I did not—I cannot say how many men were employed at the time this train came—perhaps there might be four or five men within the compass of three or four yards—all the parcels are pitched in a heap on the floor and each man picks out his own—Mr Davis is managing clerk for Messrs Horne and Chaplin—I have beard that he refuses to take silver from the men JAMES SMITH I am porter to the London and Birmingham Railway Company at Euston-square On the 28th

railway station at half-past seven o clock that morning with the prisoner—we had a cart—there were parcels in the cart—the prisoner drove the horse and I sat by his side—I remember a box being put in at Euston-square station directed to Mr Stereker Budge-row—I sorted that with other parcels—the direction was nailed on with five tacks and tied round with cord—it appeared to be a rather heavy box—the cart was driven to the Old Bailey—I remember there seeing the parcel—I left the cart to deliver a parcel in Prujean-square—I was gone about five or ten minutes—when I returned I found the cart was standing at Mr Fenn s door in Newgate-street—the prisoner was not with it but standing at the corner of the Magpie and Stump—I asked why he left the cart—he said he left some one in charge of it—I did not see any one in charge of it—the prisoner and I then went to the cart—he asked if I would go and do something in Paternoster-row and I asked him to take a parcel to Fisher s in Newgate-street—I left him in Newgate-street and I took the cart to Paternoster-row—he appointed to meet me at the corner of Queen-street Cheapside—when I left him he turned round to go towards the Magpie and Stump—when I got to Paternoster-row I looked for the box and it was gone—I had seen it in the cart when we stopped in the Old Bailey—after delivering the parcels in Paternoster-row I went to Queen-street and saw the prisoner there—his brother and Cottrell were with him—I asked him whether we had not a parcel directed for Mr Stereker Budge-row—he said No that was yesterday or the morning before —I said I think we had one this morning —he did not go any further with the cart he said he was not very well—he had had rather too much to drink and he asked me if I would go with the cart—Cotterell was to go with me—it was the prisoner s duty to have gone through with the cart and delivered the parcels with me—in the evening of that day I found at the bottom of the cart the direction of Mr Stereker Budge-row —I put it in the bottom of the cart again—the next morning I told the prisoner I had found a direction to Mr Stereker Budge-row—he said that was the name he had got one charged to in his book and asked what I had done with the direction—I said I had left it at the bottom of the cart—he asked me to get it him—I told him I would as soon as we got rid of some of the parcels—I found it the same morning and gave it to the prisoner—he tore it up and told me to swear that I never saw the parcel—on the Saturday I communicated this to my brother—I and he went to the railway station Cross-examined Q About how many parcels were there when you put them in the cart A Between fifty and sixty—this was rather a dirty box the cord was tied round tight I took particular notice of it—the direction was nailed on with five nails—I did not hear the gentleman call out this parcel—it was with the other parcels when I came to the station—it is a common thing when we go out for one to take a direction of two or three streets and another some others—I delivered a box wrapped round with cloth at Pru-jean-square and five or six parcels in Paternoster-row—none before I got there—I missed the box before that on my first stopping—it had been on the right-hand side of the cart—there were other parcels by the side of it—it was standing on the top of parcels there was nothing upon it—I found Cottrell in Queen-street and the prisoner s brother—I did not hear Cottrell undertake to do the prisoner s work for him—he did do it—he was standing at the side of the horse when I asked the prisoner if we bad not a parcel for Budge-row—I said I could not see it in the cart—I missed it but I was not certain whether the prisoner had taken it—I told him There is a parcel gone that I am sure of —we joined company again about four or five hours after in Gray s Inn-road and then he appeared to have recovered from his drunkenness—the cart had one parcel in it then—Cottrell rode in the cart—I found the direction at the bottom of the cart between two and three o clock—Cottrell got out a little after three—he was inside when I arrived at the Globe-inn and then the cart was empty except one parcel—I cannot say where Cottrell sat because I was driving and did not look round to see—he was not sitting by the side of me he must have been inside where this direction was—I did not go and tell any one Here is the direction of the box that is lost —it was nine at night that I found it when I was in Bishopsgate-street—on Friday about three Mr Dawson our superintendent asked me something about it—I told him I did not know any thing about it—I did not tell about my finding a direction and putting it back—I told my brother something on Saturday—there was a great stir about the negligence of the porter about this parcel—I told my brother because I had told Mr Dawson a falsehood about it—there was no straw at the bottom of the cart MR PAYNE Q Why did you tell Mr Dawson an untruth that you after-repented of A Because the prisoner told me I should get into trouble if I said anything GEORGE KENT I am a blind-maker living in Kensington-row Gray s Inn-road I went to the Pinder of Wakefield in Gray s Inn-road for change—the landlady said she could not give it me—I got change from a man there—I cannot say exactly what it consisted of but a great deal of it was fourpenny-pieces—the man who gave me change was in company with another—I should know the other man—I believe the prisoner is the man who gave me the change Cross-examined Q Will you undertake to swear to him A I will not WILLIAM STOWTON I keep the Globe in Darby-street King s-cross I remember on Wednesday the 28th of Dec Thorogood coming from a cart with a man—he had some communication with the prisoner there who had been there before—Barker was with him—they came between two and three o clock—the prisoner was not sober—the prisoner asked me to change 2l or 3l worth of silver—I only took 1l —there were 12s or 14s worth of four-penny-pieces among it—I said I have so many joes already I won t take any more —I gave one sovereign for 1l of silver Cross-examined Q Did you take any fourpenny pieces A Not one—I saw them THOMAS BARKER On the 28th of Dec I went with the prisoner to the Pinder of Wakefield—he had 1l worth of silver—I gave change for a sovereign because the landlady would not take it—I gave that 1l worth of silver for the sovereign—the prisoner put the silver there—it consisted of shillings and 10s or 11s worth of fourpenny-pieces—we had been to the Globe before—we took them there because they would not take them at the Globe Cross-examined Q What was the whole amount of fourpenny-pieces A I think there were 10s worth—I live in Greville-mews WILLIAM THOROGOOD My brother made a communication to me on Saturday about something that had happened to Messrs Chaplin and Horne in consequence of which I went up to the station and made a statement there JOHN SAVAGE I keep the Rising Sun in Somers-town A few days after Christmas I gave the prisoner a 5l note and he gave me 5l of silver—there were no fourpenny-pieces among them Cross-examined Q How long have you known him A He has been in the habit of bringing me change all the last summer—I always thought him to be a well-conducted honest man FREDERICK ALDHOUSE I am clerk to Home and Chaplin The prisoner paid me his accounts up to the 27th of Dec —we always asked them to bring at much gold as they could BENJAMIN COTTRELL I am porter at the Cross Keys Wood-street On the 28th of Dec I drove the prisoner s cart—I first saw him between Wood-street and Milk-street—he was talking to somebody—he asked me to go with the cart and the boy—I refused to go at first but afterwards consented from the persuasion of the prisoner s brother—I went down Cheapside to the corner of Queen-street Cross-examined Q Was not the reason the brother gave that he was not fit to do duty as he had been drinking too much A Yes he was intoxicated—it was very near ten o clock in the morning—the boy did not say to me that he had lost a parcel JAMES BARRY I am superintendent of the police of the London and Bir-mingham Railway I took the prisoner on the 2nd of Jan at Mr Horne s private house in Bedford-row—he said he was very much distressed and had pawned his watch to make up his accounts which I afterwards found to be untrue—I found 2l 10s in gold 1l 0s 2d in silver and some copper on him THOMAS THOROGOOD re-examined I do not think we took any fourpenny-pieces on the 28th—we do not generally get more than six or seven in a day—he had not drank anything with me on the road—he was quite sober when he got to the Old Bailey Edward Way of Sun-street Bishopsgate and—Ewell potato-dealer Pit field-street Hoxton gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 26 — Transported for Seven Years

t18430130-832  832 WILLIAM FRANCIS STEEL was indicted for stealing on the 28th of July I watch value 1l 15s the goods of Joseph Knowles his master MR BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution JOHN KNOWLES I am a silversmith and watchmaker and live in Bolingbroke-row Camberwell-road The prisoner had been in my service for about thirteen months—this is my watch—it was in my possession a week or a fortnight previous to the 28th of July—about two months prior to the prisoner s being taken which was on the 30th of Dec I missed ten watches and that was one of them—I mentioned this one and described it to him—he said they were lent—he did not say to whom—he handed me three duplicates—he said one was of the gold watch which the lady had inquired after and the others of two watches belonging to me—I took one of the duplicates to Mr Bradbury s saw this watch there and obtained it from him Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q You are not a watch-maker A No—the prisoner was employed to repair watches for me and he made one—I had not then known of his having pledged my watches—I have since ascertained that he had pledged watches from time to time—I do not know any instance of his pledging a watch and taking it out—I remember a spring dial at a beer shop—I do not remember that being pledged but I remember its being taken out—soon after the prisoner was in my employ I bought the duplicate of a spring dial of a person and the prisoner said I have one if you will redeem it but I did not know it bad been pledged by him—I never knew he had pledged any thing—he did not take work home with my consent or knowledge—I remember a 3l lever watch—he did not take that home with my knowledge to put a new escapement—I employed him to make a new watch for Mr Kay—I did not know that he took that home—I do not know how much he expended on that—I sold it for seven guineas—I did not pay him for it—the prisoner did not take home a watch of mine—I know there was a watch with eight holes in the shop for some time Q And then as you did not pay the prisoner he took it A No he showed me a watch and said he should put my name on it but I never saw it after—I do not know that when he was apprehended he was finishing a clock with a double dial at home nor that I owe him any thing but for that little watch—I think he said it was 3l 15s — Mr Kay is the prisoner s writing on the back of the duplicate he gave me—this is the watch MR BALLANTINE Q Had this watch required any repairs A I hung it in a case to be repaired at the prisoner s leisure—I gave him no directions whatever to take it out of my house—he had no right to take it out—I had not paid what I owed him because he set fire to my premises carelessly and the damage done was 6l or 7l —he said he would pay me—he had not demanded the money for this watch—I asked him several times what it was—his tools are with me now—he may have them if he pays what is due—there is 2l 10s remaining due on a gold watch which he took away HENRY WILLIAM HALL I am assistant to Mr Bradbury a pawnbroker in the London-road—this watch was pledged in the name of John Brown on the 28th of July—Mr Knowles took it out—this is the duplicate of it Cross-examined Q Do you know who pledged it A No I did not take it in JOSEPH KNOWLES re-examined This is the duplicate the prisoner gave me SAMUEL WRIGHT police-constable P 172 I took the prisoner on the 30th of Dec at the prosecutor s shop—I said it was for taking some watches from his master—he said he had done so and he could not deny it—I then went to his own house—I saw a female there—I told her to turn out her pockets—the prisoner was present and told her to give the duplicates up—I got several duplicates there some from his wife and some from his son whom he sent up stairs Cross-examined Q Were you present when he gave up the duplicate which relates to this watch A I was not—it was given up before I took him I believe—I am sure the prisoner said he had taken the watches and could not deny it COURT to MR KNOWLES Q Had you made any charge against him before he gave you up these duplicates A I questioned him about a watch that a lady had called for and then he gave me up the three tickets WILLIAM BEAL a haberdasher in Bolinbrook-row and George Wilkins a carpenter at Brixton gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 40 — Transported for Seven Years There were two other indictments against the prisoner and the prosecutor stated he had paid 50l to redeem watches Before Mr Recorder 
t18430227-1011  1011 JAMES GODDARD was indicted for stealing on the 30th of Jan 5lbs weight of indigo value 30s the goods of the London Dock Company his masters MESSRS ADOLPHUS and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution JOHN CLEMENT I am constable of the London Docks The prisoner was in their employ as manager of the indigo warehouse—on Monday afternoon the 30th of Jan a few minntes before four o clock I saw the prisoner coming towards the west gate of the dock from the indigo warehouse—he came up to the gate—I said Mr Goddard where are you going at this time — it was earlier than he ought to go—he ought to have been at the warehouse to see the men out and the warehouse locked up —he said I am only going to the Custom-house I shall be back in aminute —I said The reason I have stopped you is I think you have got something in your hat and I must see what you have got —I got him into the box—he appeared much distressed and said I am a ruined man —I took off his hat and found these four cakes of indigo—I felt his pockets and found he had some more indigo in his under coat pockets—he took that out at my desire—I asked him the reason of his taking that indigo out—he said I have got indigo of my own I am taking that out to test the prices —I said Have you indigo of your own at the warehouse —he said Yes —I said What quantity —he said A 2lbs sample left last quarter —I have weighed the indigo that was found on the prisoner—it is 5 3/4lbs —this would not be taken out of the docks as a sample in this state and manner—it is worth 6s a pound before the duty is paid—I left him in the custody of the gate-keeper Fryer—the prisoner said For God s sake don t expose me Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q He has been in the service of the company some time A Yes ten year—it was not his place to give passes for indigo so that persons would be allowed to go out—he has not been allowed to sign passes the last five months—he was interdicted from signing passes for indigo the last five months—supposing an importer to give an order the prisoner would not give a pass then—not for the last five months—at the Police-court I said he was authorized to sign passes for samples of indigo and I had examined passes—I knew he was at one time allowed to sign passes for samples of indigo but till my return to the dock that day I did not know he was interdicted from doing it—there is a book called the signature-book which is kept by the gate-keepers of persons who are authorised to sign passes and the prisoner s name is erased from the book COURT Q What means have you of knowing that he has been interdicted A The superintendent informed me of it MR PRENDERGAST Q Will you swear the prisoner has not signed passes within one week of this occurrence A He has not to my knowledge—I will not swear he has not—the book I speak of as being scratched is kept at the office—I can have access to it—it is scratched by the accountant—it is generally kept in my own office—I have not looked at it since I was at the police-office—I was informed by the superintendent that he had interdicted Mr Goddard from signing passes—whether the name has been scratched out I do not know—I am sure I separated the pieces found in the prisoner s hat from those in his pocket—these are the four found in his hat—he carried his hat very well—it had no greater motion than a pocket handkerchief and a pair of gloves would have given it—I could not tell that he had anything in it till I spoke to him and then his countenance fell Q His hat had a little appearance which attracted your attention A I had considerable doubt whether it had anything in it before I spoke to him but when I did I had no doubt—his countenance altered—he smelt of rum and appeared to have been drinking from his manner—he was not perfectly sober—he was about the usual pitch that I have seen him at other times WILLIAM ROBSON I am warehouse-keeper of No 1 department at the London Docks—the indigo warehouse forms a portion of that department On Monday the 30th of Jan there was a considerable number of chests of indigo in it and there are still—176 chests by the same ship—these were all open at that time and have been so since—the prisoner had the entire management of that warehouse and full access to every chest in the ware-house—he was manager of the indigo and one part of his duty was to take eare that no part of it was taken away—I have looked at the indigo found in his hat and pockets and have compared it with that in the chests—I am not a judge of indigo but the stamp on these squares is the same that the exterior of the chests bear and some of the squares in the chests bear the same mark A I K—I have got them here—these marks correspond with some of the other indigo left behind and the marks on the chests Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q You would not undertake to swear it is the same A No all the cakes that are imported have not the same marks there are a great variety of marks in eighty or a hundred chests—they might have different stamps—I dare say it is a common mark—the indigo is sold at quarterly sales at such sales it is usual to sell the warehouse sweepings for the benefit of the proprietor of the warehouse at the docks—after the sales the floors are swept up and there are very frequently small pieces as big as a walnut or occasionally a little larger these are picked up and generally crushed for the purpose of mixing with the ordinary dust that is swept from the floor—I believe it is better in lumps but it has always been the custom in the indigo trade for this rubbish to be crushed that is our practice as introduced by the prisoner—I cannot say how much we do in a year it depends on what we have in 1842 the docks sold perhaps three tons of it and nearly half of that was sawdust—it sometimes fetches 2s a-pound MR ADOLPHUS Q When this is crushed does it crush into solid cakes again A No it is sold by public auction in the Auction Mart GEORGE DIX I am constable of the docks—I was directed to watch the indigo warehouse—I was doing so on the 30th of Jan —I saw the prisoner come from the indigo warehouse and go towards the west gate—I communicated with Clements Cross-examined Q That was his proper place to be in A Yes he was to leave the warehouse when the doors were closed and the labourers out but they were not closed then COURT Q How long was it after you saw him come out of the ware-house that he went to the west gate A I should think six or seven minutes WILLIAM FRYER I am gate-keeper of the London Docks—on the 30th of Jan a little before four o clock I was directed by Clements to go into the box near the west gate to take charge of the prisoner I saw him there and I saw some dust of indigo on the desk—I asked what he was stopped with was it with the indigo he said Yes —I said How much a pound the prisoner said No four or five —I said I was very sorry it was a bad job—he said he should be taken to the police and he had no business to have done it—he wanted to go in and see Mr Chandler the superintendent I said I must not let him out of the box till Mr Clements returned—Mr Clements returned in about twenty minutes and told him be would have to go before a Magistrate—when Mr Clements was gone the prisoner said be ought to be treated the same as the rest—he said Gale was stopped some time ago with coffee and that was quite as bad a case as his and it was looked over and Mr Robson had been robbing the Company of time and stuff for weeks and that was looked over—he said Spratty had got a case already packed and ready for removal and he was suffered to go without going before a Magistrate—he said he should make up big mind for the worst he should say nothing at present but what he had to say he should say before another tribunal Cross-examined Q All you heve been stating was what he said in answer to questions A No I asked him what he was stopped with—I have been at the gate about twelve months and in the dock about three years—I believe Robson is one of the witnesses MR ADOLPHUS Q Is the warehouse within the walls of the London Docks A Yes THOMAS COOPER I have compared the indigo produced with the indigo in the wirehouse it corresponds in marks with the rest of the indigo there Cross-examined Q You have seen the same at the West India and East India Docks A No I have not seen that mark before—I belong to the East and West India Dock Company s indigo warehouse—I swear I have not said that I have indigo of this mark precisely in my warehouse—I have seen such marks but not in the warehouse—I have seen them marked on the canvas when they have been going to other docks—the same mark is put on the canvas that is on the indigo—that on the canvas is the import mark but the indigo may be another mark—as to the mark on the goods inside I could not say MR PRENDERGAST called JOHN SQUIRES I am working forman in the indge department of the London Dockes—I have known the prisoner nine years—I saw him on the day in question at nine o clock in the morning waiting outside the warehouse door before it was unlocked—he was not soher—I saw him again about the warehouse three or four times—he was still worse about twelve or one o clock—there are conveniences in the docks to get drunk there—I saw him again about half-past three o clock and I should say he was then decidedly drunk—when he is drunk I should say he does not know what he is about he is more like a madman than anybody else—I have seen him go to the men and actually order them to do things they ought not to do order them to go to work about things that they ought not to do and five minutes after he has come to me and said These men are doing wrong —he has conducted himself in an irrational manner MR ADOLPHUS Q Have you ever seen him drunk before this day A Many times—I am a working foreman—I have been in the Company s service fifteen years—my superiors were all aware of this and parties coming down to the docks respectable merchants have said he would some day lose his situation—I saw him three times that day he war not sober at nine o clock worse between twelve and one and decidedly drunk at three—he was sitting in the counting-house—I had some conversation with him in the day he answered the questions on some occasions not always—he was sitting in the office with his head on his hand MR CHARNOCK Q Was that the position for a man to be in lying with his head on his hands A No—I should say the proprietors do not allow men to lay their heads on their hands JOHN ALGER I have known the prisoner from ten to twelve years—his character has been perfectly honest up to the present moment—since the death of his wife about fifteen months ago he has been quite a different man to what he was before—I have seen him frequently at my house when he has been intoxicated—when he has been in that state he has been quite different to other men—when he is intoxicated he is an insane man—he came to my house one evening—we sat a considerable time in conversation and I said to him I have just purchased a watch —he said Let us look —I gave it into his hand and he took and threw it behind the fire—he did not appear at that time conscious of the injury he was doing to me or my watch—I saw him the next morning and I mentioned to him the strange conduct of throwing my watch behind the fire and he knew nothing at all about it—I have observed the same manner with him when he has been in that state—I saw him on the day before this matter occurred at the docks—he was then very much in liquor—from my observation of his manner when in a state of intoxication I can undertake to say that his manner is altogether different to what I have ever seen in other men—I have known these fits of temporary insanity to continue upon him during the time of his intoxication at times—but when he has been in this state he has notwithstanding this appeared to walk tolerably strong—he had the command of his legs like other men but his reason appeared to be gone—I recollect another instance—he was at my house and it rained very hard—he said It is a very wet night and he got up took his coat off and walked out for about half an hour COURT Q Does he bestow his company generally on you when he is drunk A No my lord—the watch was a great deal damaged it stopped it—I did not have it repaired—it was not worth repairing—it had gone before and it has not gone since it was so much injured—it remained behind the fire some minutes—we took it out with the tongs as soon as we could JOHN CHAMBERS I am a surgeon and live in Hackney-road—I have known him about two years—I have seen him in a state of intoxication such as has been described—I have seen him so too often and there is a degree of nervous excitement about the brain that gives rise to those circumstances that you have heard—I have seen other tipsy men—the conduct of the prisoner is contrary to theirs—he can stand on his legs generally—I decidedly think he does not know right from wrong MR BALLANTINE Q Do you mean when in a state of drunkenness you believe him to be insane and not know right from wrong A He does not—from what I have observed I believe he would commit a theft without knowing what he was doing—that is one of his failings—he has a craving—I have heard the evidence in this case and that leads roe to suppose that he was in one of his fits of insanity—I have heard that on being taken he said I am a ruined man —the suddenness of the impression he received on being taken on suspicion threw off his insanity and very likely brought him to his senses—it would with many people—I am not relatted to him—I have attended his family—I have represented that he was insane to his unfortunate wife who died Q But we understand he has only been insane since her death and that is fifteen months ago A I believe it is—this has been increased from time to time—I do not know any one living person to whom I have mentioned it COURT Q Is he sane when he is not intoxicated A He is a singular man altogether I never could make head or tail of him JETHRO VIAL I am a licensed victualler and live in Virginia-row Bethnal-green I have known the prisoner from the first hour he came under the Hon East India Company s warehouse twelve years ago—I never saw nor heard anything dishonest of him till this accusation—he is an honest upright man—I have frequently gone to his house like I have to other warehouse-keepers but never saw anything belonging to the Hon East India Company s department MR ADOLPHUS Q Have you known him up to the present time A I have known him—I have seen him in my house once and I have been to his house COURT Q Did you ever see him intoxicated A I have and sorry I am to say it and likewise his wife has been ill-used by him when in that state Edward Brennand a solicitor and John Giddy a tailor in Gloucester-street Hackney-road gave the prisoner a good character

t18430227-1046  1046 JAMES RAWLINGS was indicted for stealing on the 21st of Jan 79 1/2 yards of lawn value 38s the goods of Thomas Allen and another his masters and JAMES NEWCOMBE for feloniously receiving the same well knowing it to have been stolen against the Statute &c MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution MOSES MARTYN I am warehouseman in the vice of Messrs Allen and Smith who live in Friday-street Cheapside On the 21st of Jan I was ordered to conceal myself—Amos Hayton was at the entry-desk in the counting-house at that time—Rawlings who is a porter in the house was directed to remain in the warehouse while the others were gone to dinner and not to leave—he was left in charge of the warehouse—I concealed myself behind the counting-house—about half-past two o clock I watched Rawlings and saw him go into the linen-room to a box in which some lawns were—I bad counted the pieces of lawn in that box about five minutes before and found forty-nine pieces—I saw him put his band on the goods—his back was towards me—he instantly left and walked behind some boxes which were standing in front of the warehouse—I then came forward from my hiding-place and asked what he was doing there—he said he was looking for a sheet of paper—I immediately went to the box counted the pieces and found three pieces were missing—in the meantime Rawlings walked forwards and Hayton told me he was gone out—I went in search of him and could not find him—in about an hour he returned—Mr Allen called him into the counting-house and afterwards gave him into custody—no one had any possiblity of getting to the box between the time of my finding forty-nine pieces of lawn and counting them again and finding only forty-six except Rawlings—there are three pieces of lawn here now—I am able to say that this is one of the forty-nine pieces which I saw in the box before I saw Rawlings go to it—I know it by the No 591 on it—the marks have been removed from the other two pieces—I had observed this number on them before—here are several other pieces of the same lot and the same manufacture but there is no mark or number to enable me to detect them—they contain about six yards and a half in each and are wrapped in green Cross-examined by MR WYLDE Q There is only one that you can swear to as having been in the box A No—the manufacturer puts the number on it—we get them in round numbers from 591 to any number we like—there may be a great number sent out from the same manufactory with 591 on them MR CLARKSON Q Do they come in duplicate pieces A Yes—these are half pieces—I have brought the other half piece from the warehouse which is the duplicate to this No 591 —there were seven of these No 6 in the box and three of them were missed AMOS HAYTON I am in the prosecutor s service I remember on the 21st of Jan Rawlings was directed not to leave the premises—I did not know at that time that Martyn was concealed—Rawlings asked me for a sheet of paper—I told him he would find one in the Irish warehouse which is the place where it is kept—he went there but I could not see what he did—I saw him go to the part where the lawns are kept—shortly after Mr Martyn made his appearance suddenly—Rawlings came away and went out—he had no occasion to go and I had not given him leave—in about an hour he returned and Mr Allen gave him into custody—I was present when Mr Smith gave Rawlings direction not to leave NICHOLAS PEARCE I am an inspector of police of the A division In consequence of information I went on the 7th of Feb to the shop of Wallis and Southwood in Parliament-street and found these six pieces of lawn which are the subject of this inquiry WILLIAM SOUTHWOOD I am in partnership with Mr Wallis a linen-draper in Parliament-street I believe these six pieces were bought of Newcombe but my partner buys the goods—I was not present—I delivered these goods to Mr Pearce Cross-examined Q Have you before this bought similar pieces to these of Newcombe A We have bought lawns with the same name on them MR CLARKSON Q How much did you pay for these A I am not certain but I see that one is marked to sell at 1s 4d SAMUEL SPARROW WALLIS I am in partnership with Mr Southwood I bought these six pieces of lawn of Newcombe at 1s a yard—I bought nine other pieces at the same time—I think I bought ninety-six yards and a half THOMAS ALLEN I am partner with Mr Smith—we are warehousemen in Friday-street These lawns as charged to us by the manufacturer average about 2s a yard—I should say 1s a yard is not a fair price for them—we should be happy to buy any quantity at that price if we could buy them fairly—on the 21st of Jan I directed Martyn to conceal himself—we had missed upwards of fifty pieces of lawn—Rawlings was to be told by my partner to remain in the warehouse while the others went to dinner—we sell these lawns at 1d or 2d a yard profit—we get four or five per cent on them—there is no doubt about this one No 591 being ours and the others too HENRY SMITH police-constable E 148 I have been lately searching into some transactions in the neighbourhood of Friday-street among the warehousemen—I found that a number of the porters of the warehousemen were in the habit of congregating at the Admiral Carter in Bartholomew-close which is kept by Deadman—I took a lodging there for the purpose of watching those persons—I have seen Rawlings and Newcombe there talking and drinking together—I saw Rawlings there several times while he was in the employ of Allen and Smith—I have watched him when he went from the Admiral Carter to Allen and Smith s in Friday-street and gave them information—the last time I saw the prisoners together previous to the 21st of Jan was on the 17th of Jan —they were then in conversation—Newcombe went to the bar and changed a sovereign and gave Rawlings some money or some money passed between them—I apprehended Rawlings on the 11th of Feb in the Commercial-road—I said I am a police officer and you are my prisoner —he said What for —I said For stealing seven pieces of lawn of Mr Allen your late master —he said Very well I will go quietly with you Rawlings Defence On the 21st of Jan when he accused me of taking three pieces of lawn he said If I would not go into the warehouse and tell him where it was he would give me into custody I said I had not seen any he said Mr Martyn saw me take it I did not go out for ten minutes and if he saw me take them there was plenty of time for him to take me there were other porters in the warehouse Mr Smith told me to wait till some one came and when I saw Martin I said If you will wait I will go he made no answer Joseph Mallett servant to Mr Cullam a brewer gave Rawlings a good character RAWLINGS— GUILTY Aged 35 — Transported for Seven Years NEWCOMBE

t18430227-1047  1047 GEORGE COWARD was indicted for stealing on the 6 Oct 30 1/2 yards of waistcoating value 8l the goods of John Smith and another his masters and JAMES NEWCOMBE for feloniously receiving the same well knowing it to have been stolen against the Statute &c MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution SYDNEY SMITH I am in partnership with John Smith—we are woollen and Manchester warehousemen and live in King-street Cheapside Coward was our porter—on the 6th of Oct he was desired to take two trusses of silk and wollen which were to be returned to Mr Norton—they were called waistcoatings and I believe Coward went away as though to take them—I do not remember his returning—I should think about five or six days afterwards I questioned him about this parcel delivery book—I asked him how it was the two trusses had not gone back—he said they had—I said It appears they have not and beside that there is only one in your entry for them —I had asked for the book when I heard the trusses had not gone back—this figure which is now a 2 in this book was then a 1 and the word One is written under it as being received by Pickford—the prisoner said I tied the two trusses together —that satisfied me that it might be so and that they had been taken as one by Pickford—on the 8th of Feb the officer showed me these goods which are here—I than looked at Coward s book again and found the figure I had been altered to a 2 but the word One Pickford and Company remained—I have examined these two pieces of waistcoating which are here and they correspond in pattern and quality with the goods I expected to receive from Mr Norton—I do not know whether the trusses had been opened or not but I received the invoice and I said Let them go bank —these are precisely the description of goods which I had ordered and which I desired might go back—they amounted to 8l 0s 7d at 5s 3d a yard—Coward had access to the warehouse—his wife and him slept there Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Are we to understand that you saw the contents of either of these trusses or that on the 6th of Oct you saw either one or two delivered to Coward A I did not—I was as that time very busy about my own private affairs—I did not send a vast quantity of goods back—I had very few—I do not recollect tending any others back but these on the 6th of Oct —I did not see these trusses—I ordered them to go back—I can only tell the contents of them from the invoice—these are called waistcoating—they are known in the trade by that name JOHN AYRES I am porter to Messrs Pickford and Co of Wood-street On the 6th of Oct Coward came to the wharf and brought one truss not two tied together but one single truss directed to Norton Clayton West—he produced this book looking at it for me to check it with the figure 1 and I put my initial A on it and the figure 6—I then handed it to him to take to Mr Edwin—I recollect at the time there was but one truss—if there had been two tied together I should have noticed it Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Did you see the truss A I did not—it is not usual to weigh the goods unless they are carriage-paid—those that are not paid are weighed at the station at Camden-town—small parcels might be sent without weighing but this was a truss and would be weighed at Camden-town THOMAS EDWIN I am clerk to Messrs Pickford and Co I was in their employ on the 6th of Oct —I have examined this entry in this parcel-book—this is not the way in which it left our office it has been altered from a 1 to a 2—this word One and T E is my writing—I should not have written One if there had been a 2—I did not see the truss myself Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Do you know any thing about the bales A I did not see them—you can see where the I has been and to the best of my belief it has been changed to a 2—I can see the remains of the 1 GEORGE GELDER I am clerk and traveller to Mr Norton of Clayton West near Huddersfield About the 21st of Sept I received an order from Mr Smith for waistcoating—amongst others these two pieces were forwarded to him and a third piece corresponding with this small pattern—they were sent on the 4th of Oct —I expected to receive these back—we received as piece but not these—Mr Norton then went to London—these were invoiced at 5s 3d a yard Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q you had things of this kind A Yes—I did not take them to the carrier or the railway Cross-examined by MR WYLDE Q There was some order sent to your master about the 20th or 21st of Sept A Yes—this was not the only Order we had for waistcoating—we had a variety of orders SAMUEL WOOD I am a fancy weaver and live at Malthorp near Hudden-field I am employed by Mr George Norton—I wove the piece ef waistcoating from which this little pattern has been taken between the 20th and 30th of Sept last—I also wove one of these two pieces but not the other—this is the one I wove—each piece was ten yards and a half long—I never saw a piece of exactly the same pattern as this is—I never made one of the same figure before—I delivered them to the person who takes in work for Mr Norton—this other piece I saw on the 16th of Feb —it is the same description as mine hut I did not weave it GEORGE GELDER re-examined This other piece was woven for us by one of our weavers and it is one of the pieces that was forwarded to London HENRY SMITH police-constable G 148 In consequence of direction I placed myself as a lodger at the Admiral Carter—I saw Newcombe there and Coward was there almost everyday—I have seen them in conversation together and they have dined together there Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q When did you first set them A About the 27th of Dec —I found out the house on the 23rd and on the 24th I took lodgings there—I do not know whether it is a house of call for porters—there is a cobler s stall outside the house but not-a pitching-block MR CLARKSON Q Did you see a great many linen drapers men and porters there A Yes JAMES DEADMAN I keep the Admiral Carter in Bartholomew-close I know both the prisoners—Coward frequented my house for about five weeks from Dec to Jan and Newcombe was in the habit of coming for about three months—I cannot say whether he came before Dec or not—I have seen the prisoners together two or three times a week at my house—they might have dined there but never dined with me Cross-examincd by MR DOANE Q I suppose you have seen many other people at your house A I may have seen twenty more—Newcombe went by the name of Roberta I think—there is a block for porters to pitch their loads at the door SAMUEL SPARROW WLLIS I bought these two pieces of waistcoating of Newcombe on the 6th of Oct at 3s 9d a yard and another piece of which this small piece is a pattern—there were 10 1/2 yards in each of those pieces that are entire and 10 3/4 yards in the other piece—I sold the piece that this is the patten of for 50s not quite 5s a yard Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q What day do you venture to say you purchased these A On the 6th of Oct—I recollect the day by this-entry 6th 0ct Newcombe 24l 11s 6d —this includes other things as well as these—my attention was called to this in Feb last after I had been to Bow-street—I will swear these goods were not bought in Aug last—when I was examined before I spoke from memory—I was in the country in Sept and these goods were not purchased till I returned—I have an entry in my day book that I sold this piece for 2l 10s Cross-examined by MR WYLDE Q you do not mean that there is anything particular about the goods themselves A No—I swear I had them in my possession and that 1 bought them of Newcombe—I have never expressed a doubt as to who I bought them of—I did speak with hesitation but I corrected myself afterward and recollected it perfectly well directly after SAMUEL RUST My wife bought a piece of waistcoating at Mr Wallis s at 5s a yard and I paid for it NICHOLAS PEARCE I am inspector of police I went on the 7th of Feb to Mr Wallis and found these pieces JONATHAN WHITCHER police-constable A 27 I took Coward on the 7th of Feb —I asked if he knew a man named Newcombe—he said he did not Henry Cockrell an upholsterer Benjamin Turner

Fowler and another his masters and WILLIAM FAY for feloniously receiving the same well knowing them to have been stolen against the Statute &c MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution JAMES BRANNAN police-sergeant G 20 I live in Radnor-street St Luke s In consequence of information at three o clock on Saturday morning the 28th of Jan I went to Mr Johns house No 44 Radnor-street—I saw Mr Johns there—I went with him to a back shed in the yard and found there a wooden box with a tin box in it with forty or fifty tin plates underneath the tin box—it was very heavy but I did not open it then—I learned from Johns who lodged there but at that time he did not know his name—I left them there and communicated with Mr Swift jun and between four and five in the afternoon he accompanied me to this same place—we went into the same shed—we found the wooden box containing the tin box and the tin plates—Mr Swift jun examined the plates and pointed out the marks to me—he identified them—I placed them in the same situation and again left them—on Tuesday evening the 31st of Jan for some reason of my own I went again Wardrop was then in custody on another charge—I then examined it with Mr Swift—I found the wooden box containing the tin box that had been full was then empty and no tin plates but there were a few tin rivets and some solder 2l 5s in half-crowns and 1s 3 1/2 d in copper which I had seen previous to that in the box—there were no half-crowns before—this is the tin box—on the 31st Wardrop was taken into custody with twenty tin plates round his person slung by a handkerchief attached to a loop—they were curved as they are now—in this state they travel more readily round the body—he said he lodged in Radnor-street St Luke s—I showed him the boxes and asked whose they were—he said They are mine —I then pointed to the tin box and asked whose that was—he said Mine —it was opened and I said The tin plates are gone —he paused for a moment and said Yes —I then said What is this pointing to a little parcel which I found wrapped up as it is now—he said Money —I asked how much—he said 2l 5s —I again said The tin plates are removed —he said Yes but I did not remove them —the tin plates I saw on the 28th were much larger than those I produce—I took him away and as I was going I said That money was not there a day or two ago —he said No I put it there last night —I took him to the station—he wished to see Mr Swift the elder who was in company with me—he begged he would not transport him and he would tell him where the tin plates had been removed to—Mr Swift said on no consideration would he hold him out any promise in the present state of the case—Wardrop then said they were taken to a place in Brick-lane Spitalfields that the did not know the party or the number but if he was allowed he would point us out the house—in consequence of that offer I and Mr Swift went—Wardrop said he stood on the opposite side and saw the person go in with the tin plates and come out without them—he said they were removed by him and another party from No 44 Radnor-street—I went with him and the two Mr Swifts to Brick-lane a house belonging to two men named Jarman was pointed out to me—I afterwards took them because I found six large tin plates identified by Mr Swift in their possession—I believe I had seen those same tin plates in the box a day or two previous—Jarmans occupied the whole of the house and are tin plate workers—on Wardrop s crossing Shoreditch he called Mr Swift again and begged to say he would tell him all if he would not transport him—before I found the plates in Jarman s house I put some questions to Jarmau as to their having any plates there—he denied having any or having purchased any lately—there were a number of plates there—I said I wanted the tin that was brought in last night—I took the plates and produced them before the Magistrate—I had some considerable conversation with Jarman—I was ordered by the Magistrate to give the plates up—I gave them up on the last examination—they are not here to-day—on the 1st of Feb between one and two o clock in the morning I went with Mr Swift his son and another constable to a private house in Shepherdess-walk City-road—I knocked at the door which Fay opened—he was pointed out to me by Mr Swift jun —I said I belong to the police you must consider yourself in custody for some plates from Messrs Fowler and Swift s —I said he had removed some tin plates from No 44 Radnor-street St Luke s to Brick-lane last night—he said he knew nothing about it that he was neither at Radnor-street nor Brick-lane last night Cross-examined by MR WILD Q He offered no objection A No GEORGE WILLIAM JOHNS I am a housekeeper in Radnor-street St Luke s Wardrop and his sister were lodgers of mine—on Saturday the 28th of Jan I had a communication with Brannan and assisted in making an examination of the shed—on the 31st Brannan brought Wardrop in custody and showed him these boxes GEORGE EDWARDS I am Mr Johns apprentice and live with him in Radnor-street I know Wardrop—he lived there and I know Fay by sight—I have seen him several times at my master s house—he came for Wardrop—the last time I saw him was Monday evening the 30th of Jan —I saw both prisoners together in the water-closet by the side of the shed about half-past eight that evening—I saw them go into the yard with a lighted candle—they staid in the yard ten minutes—they went into the water-closet—Wardrop came out and brought the light with him from the water-closet and went into the shed—when he got into the shed he uncovered the wooden box took out the tin box unlocked it took out the tin plates that were in that box and then took out the tin plates that were in the wooden box that the tin box stood upon—after locking the tin box he placed it back again and covered it up as it was before with the lid of the wooden box and a carpet—he brought the tin plates across the yard to Fay who was waiting in the water-closet to receive them—when he took them to the water-closet I heard Wardrop say Don t make such a noise Bill counting them —I heard them rattle as though they were counting them shortly after Fay came out of the water-closet with the tin plates—Wardrop went up stairs with the light and Fay went along the passage into the street down Radnor-street towards Bath-street in a direction that would lead to Brick-lane—Wardrop came down stairs again and followed after Fay—they joined company and went away in the direction leading to Brick-lane Cross-examined Q You say they joined company—did you keep them in your eye A Yes—I was standing on the pavement—the first time I saw Fay was about a month before the 30th of Jan —I do not think I had ever seen him previous to that month—I have seen him two or three times when he came to Mr Johns to see Wardrop—I did not open the door to him—I have been in the passage and at the shop-door when he has come to ask for Wardrop—I do not remember hearing him ask for Wardrop until the 30th of Jan —I was in the shop that evening at the time I first heard Fay come to the door—I could not see the yard or water-closet from the shop—I went to the back parlour and will swear I could see into the water-closet—the door is nearly opposite to the parlour window—at one time the door of the water-closet was open at another time partly open at another time quite shut—I could not see the whole of the interior of the water-closet—it was quite a dark night—the door was open when the prisoners went in—I saw no one else there—I had helped to clean the parlour windows a month before—the direction leading to Brick-lane is a general thoroughfare to the eastern part of London—Fay had a black hat on and a short fustian jacket of a lightish colour his trowsers were of a darker colour—the parlour window is three yards and a half from the water-closet MR CLARKSON Q Had you been made acquainted with what was suspected beforehand A I had—I do not know the number of plates Fay was carrying down the street—they were very heavy I saw by the way he carried them ROBERT FOWLER SWIFT I am the son of Richard Swift—he is in partnership in the tin plate business with Alfred Fowler in St John-street—Mr Johns gave us information in consequence of which I went with Brannan on the 28th of Jan to 44 Radnor-street—I found in the shed in the yard a wooden box the tin box and the plates underneath—the plates belonged to my father and Mr Fowler—I identified them and pointed out some marks on them to the officer and told him they had passed through a roller the effect of that would be to curve them and they would be convenient to make articles and to fit the body if any one took them away—they appeared to have been straightened before they were put there—I can state on my oath that they were the property of my father and Mr Fowler—there was 1s 3 1/2 d in money in the tin box—I opened it though it was locked—the platet in that box were my father s and his partner s—I saw it again on the 31st—there were then 2l 5s in half-crowns in it and a piece of solder—I went with the officer to a house in Brick-lane Spitalfields kept by Jarman and Son who are tin-plate workers we supply tin-plate workers largely I went into Jarmans followed by an officer—some questions were put to them about the tins and they denied having purchased any—some plates were found and my father pointed out six plates on their bench in the workshop as his—I am sure they were my father s and his partner s and they were the same I had seen before in the box—I should say that on the 28th there were one hundred and fifty plates belonging to my father Cross-examined Q What is the firm A Fowler and Swift—we do an extensive business—I will not undertake to say what quantity of plates we have sold out—I am sure these were not sold—we sell them in boxes—I know that these tins had not come from boxes which were sold because these had been passed through rollers—we never sold any tins like these—ours is not the only factory that make these kind of plates or that use the rollers—there would be no distinction between our tins and the tins of other factors that use the rollers—they would not have been passed through the rollers in this state for any legitimate purpose—we never use the roller unless they are in a partly manufactured state and these plates were in the original state in which they came from the manufactory COURT Q How came these to have the shape of the roller A I believe for the purpose of being put round the body—I believe the operation of going through the rollers had been done at our house—Wardrop had access to the plates and was in the habit of sorting them out—he had been engaged by us about two months—the plates I saw were worth about sixpence each—I have no means of knowing them except from their being curved JOSEPH SHACKLE police-inspector G On Tuesday evening the 27th of Jan I received information from Johns and gave Brannan directions to go to the house and examine some boxes—on the 31st I saw Wardrop brought to the station in custody—I sent Brannan to Jarmans and he brought some tin plates—Wardrop begged of me to intercede for him and hoped Mr Swift would not transport him—he said the plates that were taken to Jarman s were his master s property—he said that in the hearing of the whole of the prisoners—the two Jarmans were then there—Fay did not say anything Cross-examined Q Are you certain as to the presence of Fay A Yes on account of the number of prisoners then at the station Fay was sent to Clerkenwell station and it was after he was brought back and the other prisoners out that this conversation took place but it had also taken place previous to that over and over again—he begged the prosecutor would not prosecute him—that if he would not transport him he would tell him the truth ROBERT FOWLER SWIFT re-examined I knew Fay at this time—he had left in June—he had been in our service during part of the time Wardrop was there—he had been there to ask for work since Wardrop has been in our employ—we employ a great number of men—I have heard that Fay is related to Jarman Wardrop s Defence I am very sorry for what I had done and throw myself on the mercy of the Court MR WILDE called MARY ANN ALLISTON I live in Gress-street Rathbone-place Oxford-street On Monday the 30th of Jan Fay came to my house with a young man twenty minutes past seven in the evening and remained there till eleven o clock MR CLARKSON Q Are you married A Yes—my

cannot recollect whether they were wet or dry—they came both together—they came on a visit—they were going to the theatre with me and my husband but my husband going out on Monday morning they stopped and spent the evening with me—Fay is a tin plate worker—I never saw Wardrop Fay had been out of business about three months he kept a shop—I believe he is a relation of the Jarmans—I do not know anything about them—I have been there but not for the last few years—I remember their being in custody and Mr Heritage applying for the six plates—I was at Worship-street—I believe Jarmans to be Fay s aunt and uncle I do not know—I am Fay s sister—my brother and Bailey were not doing anything particular at my house—they smoked in my room all the time—I was doing needle-work—Bailey went out for a little while for some half-and-half—Bailey does not live in the house—he is no relation of mine—I have known him some years—he is a printer—I met him as I was coming to the Court to-day—I saw him last Sunday morning at Mr Thomas s at Shepherdess-walk—Mr Thomas is a gentleman my brother had the shop of and lodged with some time—I went there to see Thomas—I did not go for anything particular—it was about eleven o clock—I live about three miles from Thomas—I met Bailey by accident in James-street Susannah-row—I did not expect to see him—we talked about various things—I said I should be at Fay s trial and I thought it a very great shame that he should be taken up and be innocent—he said it was a very bad job—he said nothing else and we went to Mr Thomas—he stayed there with me and came with me to the top of Shepherdess-walk and there I got into an omnibus—I have told all that passed between me and Bailey on that occasion—I had seen him after I was at Worship-street before Sunday morning—there were four examinations on this—I was not there at the first examination—I did not know of it till the evening—I was at all the others and so was Bailey—he did not go with me I met him there by accident—the Jarmans were there but not with me—I have not been friendly with them for some years—Mrs Jarman is my aunt but I have nothing to do with her—I saw Mr Heritage this morning and the night before last—I went to Heritage s house in the City-road on Sunday morning about ten o clock with Bailey—I forgot that before—I was there a very few minutes—it was eleven when I got to Thomas s—I went to see Mr Heritage about this business—I talked it over—I do not know how long I staid it might have been a quarter of an hour—I expected to meet Bailey there—he bad appointed to meet me there—I cannot say what day he made the appointment—I do not know whether it was the day before—my brother had been committed three weeks Q Did you not tell the Jury just now that except having seen Bailey at the house of Thomas and then at the Magistrate s you had not seen him A I had forgotten it—I had made the appointment to meet him there but I met him on the way—I had made the appointment on Thursday or Friday evening—my husband was not at home—I lived as barmaid at the King William the Fourth public-house in Shepherdess-walk—that is two years ago—my brother afterwards kept a shop opposite the King William the Fourth—he ceased to keep it about three months ago—he kept it four or five months—Wardrop did not live there with him—I did not know him till I went to Clerkenwell prison to see my brother and he pointed out Wardrop to me—he was in the same ward with him MR WILD Q You made an appointment to go and see Mr Heritage on Sunday A Yes—Bailey could not go out on week-days—he is a printer and at the latter end of the month he is busy—that was the reason for appointing Sunday morning—Mr Heritage lives in the City-road not a great way from Shepherdess-walk—I was present when Wardrop and Fay were before the Magistrate—I was there with Mr Heritage—I went as a witness—I told this to Mr Heritage and he said I had better reserve it till the trial—I went to give the testimony I have to-day COURT Q When was it you were before the Magistrate and saw Wardrop A On the second hearing which is three weeks ago—it was on the Thursday before I went up before the Magistrate that Wardrop was pointed out to me in Clerkenwell prison RICHARD BAILEY I am a printer in the employ of Messrs Haddon and Co of Castle-street I was so on the 30th of Jan —I know Fay—he has a sister Mrs Mary Ann Alliston—I went with Fay to his sister s on the 30th of Jan —he came down to me at half-past six o clock and I suppose it was twenty minutes past seven when we got to Mrs Alliston s—we remained there till eleven MR CLARKSON Q I suppose you have a watch A No—I took notice of the watch at Mrs Alliston s which hung over the mantel-piece—I made an observation on it—I said Wardrop the omnibus did not stop long in coming and he looked at the watch and said It is twenty minutes after seven —I said I see the time —I found Mrs Alliston at home when I got there—it was rather a damp evening under foot—it did not rain—I was invited to go there by Mr and Mrs Alliston on the Sunday week before—I had been there five or six times before—I had been there about seven o clock in the evening and staid till eleven before but not more than once—I never took particular notice of the time before—I had been an acquaintance of Fay s about four years—I knew him when he kept a tin-shop—I have seen Wardrop there—it was after Mrs Alliston had left the William the Fourth—I had seen her at Fay s shop once or twice—I had not seen them together—we havebeen there to have a glass of something to drink—I do not suppose I was in Wardrop s company above once or twice and that was at the shop—I never saw Mrs Alliston and him at the shop—I do not know the Jarmans—I did not know that they were Fay s aunt and uncle—I do not know any of his relations—when we were at Mrs Alliston s we were talking about things—when I said it was just twenty minutes past seven o clock she asked what time I left and I said at half-past six—she said You have not been long coming —they were then talking about family affairs—I did not join much in the conversation—she asked how I was off for work and all that Q Did she give you any supper A Yes some bread and cheese and celery—we supped about nine o clock—we had some half-and-half and smoked a pipe before supper—Mrs Alliston set out the supper—we did not expect supper—she bad nothing for supper but she said she would get some cheese out of the cupboard and we ate it—I had fetched the half-and-half and I fetched some more after supper—I saw nobody but Mrs Alliston and my companion Fay—I had expected to see Mr Alliston but when we got there Mrs Alliston said he was out with his master somewhere in Essex—I did not hear the master s name—it was the master he was employed by—I had seen Mrs Alliston at her house on the Sunday week before—I went merely to see her—I generally accompanied Fay there Q You went to the Magistrate s did not you A No I did not go to the Magistrate s on this charge—I did not go any where—I did not go before Mr Broughton while Fay was in charge—I was up there but they said it was no use—it was the attorney that was employed for Fay—I do not know whether ther same gentleman was employed for Jarman—the reason I know he was the attorney was Mrs Alliston and I were together—the first time I saw the attorney was on the last Saturday up at Worship-street—that was the first time I had been to the Justice—Mrs Alliston then spoke to the attorney and he said it was no use coming up now he was committed to Newgate and it would be best to come up here—I came here to-day because I was asked by Mrs Alliston Q Where did you see her A On Sunday morning she came down to my residence at No 2 Norfolk-place Curtain-road at past ten o clock and I went with her as far as Shepherdess-walk—I saw Mr Thomas there—we went to see if he could do any good if he would come up to speak for his character—Mr Thomas keeps a green-grocer s shop—we staid about half an hour—I then walked with her to the City-road and she took the omnibus COURT Did you see the attorney that day A Yes we called at his house that Sunday morning a little after eleven o clock—we called at the attorney s first and then went right on to Thomas s—when I said Mrs Alliston called on me and we went to Thomas s I had forgotten that we called on the attorney first—he lives about five minutes walk from Mr Thomas s—we staid at the attorney s about five minutes and then went on to Mr Thomas s—Mrs Alliston s room is a middling size nor very large nor very small—the Watch hangs over her mantel-piece—it is a small silver watch—I suppose they call it a lady s watch—no one called while we were there—Fay did not go out to fetch anything to eat or to drink—the celery was backwards in the yard I think—Mrs Alliston went backwards to get it—the bread and cheese was in the cupboard—she said her husband was gone with his master—she did not say anything about a funeral or a wedding WARDROP— GUILTY Aged 23 FAY— GUILTY Aged 23 Transported for seven years Sixth Jury before Edward Bullock Esq

t18430612-1767  1767 GEORGE HOWSE and WILLIAM CORNELIUS FULLER were indicted for stealing on the 13th May at St George Hanover-square 54 silver dinner plates value 351l 1 dozen plated plates 12l 1 paper plate 10s 1 silver box 6l 17 silver gilt plates 160l and 1 plate-box 2l the goods of Edward Cane and another the masters of Howse —2nd COUNT stating them to be the goods of William Robert Seymour Fitzgerald the master of Howse —3rd and 4th COUNTS stating it to be the dwelling-house of Edward Cane and another or William Robert Seymour Fitzgerald —4 other COUNTS varying the ownership of the property MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the prosecution GEORGE THORPE I was under-butler to the late Lord Fitzgerald who lived in Belgrave-square in the parish of St George s Hanover-square his lordship died in the early part of Thursday morning 11th May—Howse was his lordship s house-steward On Friday evening the day after his lordship s death I remember seeing a tall man who I did not know in company with Howse in the butler s pantry where a portion of Lord Fitzgerald s plate was kept in consequence of some repairs that were going on the chest that was stolen was in that room—I did not notice which way the man came in—I first saw him in the room—I did not notice which way the man came his back towards me—I was standing by the table in the pantry—he came in backwards—I saw no reason for that—there was nothing to account for his coming in so as not to show his face—I did not take that notice—on his coming in I left the pantry—Howse and he came in together—I returned to the pantry in about fice minutes and found them still together—Howse said to the other man I think this pantry is larger than yours he said No I think not —he then took him into the plate-closet and said You see we have had this done up for the old man but it is no use now —this was about half-past six in the evening—on the following day we were to be measured for our mourning—no time was fixed for our being measured that I know of—some directions were given to the men-servants by West about being measured—I went up among the rest to be measured—just before I went up to be measured I went out for some beer—I went out by a door that leads into the area and up the steps into the street—that door has a spring-lock to it—when I went out I pulled that door to so that the lock caught—there is an iron-gate at the top which was not kept locked which opens into the street in the ordinary way—I think there is an iron-railling on this cross piece pointing out the position on a model of the premises —I was gone about five minutes—I returned in the same way—I found the area-door fast as I had left it—I rang the bell and smith the butler and West the porter opened the door—the door was again closed I am sure of that—about three minutes afterwards I went up into the dining-room to be measured—I found all the men-servants there except Howse—as I was going up I saw Howse standing on the mat at the bottom of the stairs—he said Why don t you go up to get measured and I went—he stopped there—I had been about two minutes in the dining-room when I heard an alarm of the robbery of the plate—I went down stairs—I saw Howse at the bottom of the stairs where I had left him—he said Here is one of your boxes of plate gone —I then ran to the pantry—Howse followed me—he told me the box was gone from where it stood—I was looking to see which box it was and he said There it stood there —I said Yes and you know it it was full of silver plate —there were several other boxes of plate there—the box that was taken was No 8 and I think there were 9 or 10—there was nothing outside the boxes to tell to a stranger which contained the silver plate—they did not all contain silver plate—this was a small chest it stood on the top of another one—it was full of silver plates—I do not exactly know how many silver dinner-plates were in it—when I said to Howse Yes and you know it it was full of silver plate I turned round and looked at him and his hand shook and his lips trembled—he said Humph —I then ran into the servants hall and got my hat to go to look after the men—I do not know what Howse did—I left him in the pantry—I did not see him make any effort to go in suit—I had been in the pantry I should say three minutes before I went out for the beer—the chest was then safe—I had occasion to go to that plate chest a short time before this occurred to take out the silver plate which was used in administering the sacrament to Lord Fitzgerald—I returned that plate into the chest on Friday morning—when I returned from fetching the beer I noticed a chaise-cart standing near the railing and a man with it—I took no particular notice of it—it was standing on the side next the area that I went up by the curb-stone opposite the area-gate—I did not notice it when I went out—I am sure it was there when I returned—there were some repairs going on which had made it necessary to have the plate in the butler s pantry instead of in the room where it was usually kept—I was there the chief part of the time superintending the repairs—I did not hear Howse give any direction with respect to the repairs—there was to have been an iron door put up and about ten o clock on the morning of the robbery I heard Howse say to Smith We will not have the door put up to-day as my lord is lying dead I do not think it proper —the workmen had been at work on the Friday but not on the Thursday—the effect of Howse s direction would be to stop any workmen coming on that part of the premises on that day—no workmen came—Howse saw the men at work there on the Friday Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT TALFOURD Q How long had you been in Lord Fitzgerald s service A At that time five weeks—his lordship had not been ill all that time—I had been in the house once before I was servant there—I went to see Smith the butler—I knew him—I went to the housekeeper s room on that occasion—Mrs Parker was housekeeper at that time—I did not go into the pantry at that time—the day I was engaged I was in the pantry—Lord Fitzgerald himself engaged me in the drawing-room—I went into the pantry to see Smith—I went in with Smith—I never saw the face of the tall man on the Friday—I was standing near the window by the table when he and Howse came in—it was light—the man walked in backwards and remained with his back towards me the whole time—I should say he walked backwards about a yard and a half into the room—I passed him and walked out as he stood in that position—I did not look round to look at his face—I think there were ten boxes of plate altogether—some of them contained gilt plates—I think there was one gold plate in the box that was stolen—all the chests were in the pantry—the one this stood upon was on the ground—this was the top one and the smallest of the two—there was valuable plate in the one below it—I do not exactly know the chests Nos 3 and 7—none of the other chests contained plate of greater value than the one that was taken—I should say it was the most valuable of the lot—it was more valuable than the larger one which stood below it—when I entered the service the plate was all counted over to me—there is a door at the bottom of the area steps and another door leading into the passage between the still-room and the steward s-room and that passage leads into the main passage which goes from the housekeeper s room to the kitchen but there are no steps to that area—there is a sort of curve or scroll in the iron railing of the area leaving a space through which a man might drop down into the area and by that means get to the centre door—the area runs round the house—one part of it fronts Belgrave-square—it is a corner house—that centre door was always kept shut until that morning and all that morning it was open—it was opened to go out to clean boots and shoes and shut when we came in again—it is sometimes kept open on a fine day to admit air—that was often done of an afternoon—the area gate was kept locked at night but not in the day—anybody could unlatch the area gate and come down to ring the bell below—I have known Smith about eight or nine years—it was through him I was introduced to Lord Fitzgerald—no other servant was engaged while I was there—I do not of my own knowledge know who was in the habit of engaging the servants—I was certainly much agitated at the time of the robbery—I was quite astonished and confounded at this plate having been taken away in broad day light MR BODKIN Q There is another door which you have not been asked about which is in the partition between the two areas A Yes—that door on the day in question was fastened with a padlock—if the area door which I went out of was fast no one could gat to the door that was open except by dropping down the area JOHN WEST I was porter to the late Lord Fitzgerald About twelve o clock on Saturday the 13th of May I received from Howse orders to send the servants up stairs to the dining-room to be measured for their mourning—I was then down below in the passage near the servant s hall at the bottom of the steps—about ten minutes after I received a second message—he said Why have you not sent the servants up into the dining-room —I said I could not find them—I had not sent any one then—I went into the pantry to look for Thorpe and then into the area and looked in all the vaults the three vaults that were open—the others were closed—I then saw him coming down the area steps with a pot of beer in his hand—I let him in—the door was fast before I let him in—no one could get in except they were let in by a person inside—Thorpe gave the beer to Smith—Smith opened the door—I told Smith at the time that they were all to go to the dining-room—I told Thorpe and Smith to go up to be measured—I went to the servant s hall and then went up to the dining-room by myself and they followed me—Howse was measured first and he left the room directly afterwards Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You know Mr Cane of course Yes—he was in the house at the time and I think slept there—I believe he gave directions as to what was going on—he was in the drawing-room at twelve o clock that morning—I saw the tailor in the dining-room—I did not see him with Mr Cane—I had my own livery made when I wentinto Lord Fitzgerald s service—I found it myself—I cannot tell whether the person who was employed on this occasion was the person usually employed as tailor—I have been in Lord Fitzgerald s service about five months at this time—Howse had the full management of the house—I cannot tell whether he had keys to all the places—he had to certain places—he had not so much authority a week or a fortnight before his lordship s death—at that time his lordship was lying ill—Howse did not sleep in the house that night—he came about ten o clock that morning—I cannot tell exactly—it was about ten I think or a little after—I would not say it was not half-past elevan-he might have been in and out of the house several times unknown to me Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q About what time was it when you first heard that the plate-chest was gone A Very near half-past twelve o clock as near as I can guess COURT Q Did you hear of it before you left the dining-room A I was not measured at the time I was waiting to be measured—Smith had just done being measured and the measure was put down Woodbridge s back at the time the alarm was made—I might have been six or seven minutes in the room before the alarm was made HENRY YORK SMITH I was butler to the late Lord Fitzgerald and had been so about four months The plate was usually kept in a closet for tie purpose but in consequence of some changes taking place it was removed into the butler s pantry about ten days or a fortnight before his lordship s death—on the Friday the day after his lordship s death Howse came into the pantry—I told him the men had come to work which I thought was very improper-he said Why -I said Why his lordship is lying dead in tne house and I think it very improper for men to be at work in the pantry particularly when such an event has taken place —he said there had been an estimate made out for it and it must be fulfilled—I said I thought it was very improper-however the workmen went on—I told him I had also been to Mr Cane the executor to tell him that I thought it improper the men should be at work at such a time—Howse said if Mr Cane gate him one order and me another he did not understand it-after this the men went on with their work that day—on the Saturday Howse told me that the men would not be there that day to put up the door which was an iron door that was to have been put up to complete the closet—the box that was stolen contained fifty-four silver dinner plates seventeen gilt dessert plates two round official silver boxes 1 think I am certain there was one twelve plated soup plates and I think some others—I do not know without I had the inventory whether there was not some other plated dinner plates I think there were and a papier mache plate—I do not remember Howse making any observation about one of those boxes—the morning after his lordship s death Howse remarked to me in the pantry that one of those boxes ought to be his turning round to the plate chests that were behind us—I supposed him to mean I do not know why I should do so certainly but I supposed him to mean a small box con-taining dessert things which I had merely given into my charge but had not signed my name for—when I entered the service I signed a receipt for the plate—that box was given into my custody at the time I signed the acknowledgment but it was not in the list that I signed for—we were talking together about his lordship s death and one thing and another—I brought some sherry down from the upper drawing-room—Howse helped himself to a glass turned his head round and said One of those that small box ought to be mine —he said nothing further—I saw the plate-chest that was stolen safe in the pantry that Saturday morning—about twelve o clock or a little after on that day West gave me directions as from Howse to go into the dining-room—I went up directly-I found Howse and Woodbridge there a man named Wright a picture-dealer and the tailor—the otners came in afterwards—while I was in the dining-room all the men-servants were asseembled—the tailor was measuring Howse when I went in—he was the first measured I believe—he said he would have the first turn and I should have the next—I was measured after Howse—after Howse was measured he sat down for an instant till the tailor commenced measuring me and when he began measuring me he got up said he should go down and see Parker respecting the female servants mourning and left the room I believe—I was standing with my face towards the window—I had hardly been measured when I heard the alarm—I went down on the alarm being given—I saw Mrs Parker down at the bottom of the stairs and she said something to me—I found Howse in the passage leading into the pantry—I ran past him into the pantry to see which box was gone—he was standing in the passage and appeared to make way for me seeing me in a hurry—a person named Bull called to see me that day a little before twelve o clock I think—he was in the pantry first of all—Howse came into the pantry while we were talking together—Bull was standing up at the time Howse came in—I do not know exactly that he was about to leave—he was shortly going to leave I think—as he was going away I asked him to go and look at some beer which I had been brewing—I do not know that he exactly appeared to he going away them Howse saw him—he was standing up I suppose for the purpose of going away—Howse was not aware of my asking him to stay to look at the the beer—I do not thing he could have heard of any thing of the kind—I look him through the kitchen into the cellar—at the time I was desired to go up to be measured Bull was siting in the kitchen by a small table between the fire and the window—he had been in the cellar and seen the beer—when the area bell rang I went up to open the door and found West there-he asked me if I had seen Howse—I said no—he said he wanted me up in the dining room-at that moment Thorpe came in with some beer and the door was closed I think by West—it was closed so as to catch—I should have closed it myself if it had not been done—I then went up to the dining-room leaving Bull in the Kitchen the door of which opens close to the door Thorpe came in at Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Who had the custoday of the plate A It was in my charge with the under butler s—I was well acquainted with the contents of the various chests by looking over them and counting them—I think there were about twelve chests altogether-the chest that was taken was rather smaller than the others—I should not think any of the other chests contained plate of greater value than the plate taken—I would not take upon myself to swear there was not but I will swear it from the size of the box—I think there was not any of greater value—I think there was one chest that contained silver articles exclusively—it contained spoons and forks and everything appertaining to the use of an establishment—there were entre dishes and covers—I do not think there were chests there that would weigh considerably more than the one which was removed but I will not be positive the persons taking this plate out of the pantry would to pass the housekepper s room on the left-hand side and the still room on the left-hand side— the still-room is used for the maid-servants—there were two house-maids and a kitchen-maid—there was also a cook and the housekeeper but they had no business in the still-room—there were five female servants altogether only three used the still-room —they would then pass a passage that leads to the area on the left-hand side—they would also pass Howse s room and the servants hall to get to the area—the pantry is as close as possible to the housekeeper s room—they would not have to pass the kitchen that is at the extreme end of the passage—they could get out at the area gate without passing the kitchen—I do not think a person could open the door of the housekeeper s room and the door of the butler s pantry at the same time—I could not do it because the distance is rather too far to extend—a man with very long arms might do it—the cook has lived in the family about three months—a person named Mark Denton called on me that morning on business—he is a servant that had gone to the situation I left when I came to Lord Fitzgerald s—Mr Cane was in the house that morning—he slept in the house that night—I believe he was in the drawing-room at the time the tailor was measuring the servants—I did not know the tailor only by seeing him there that day—I understand he was brought there by Mr Cane s order—I do not know who usually made Howse s clothes—I do not know who made his clothes before—I do not know that it was not Howse s tailor that was there that morning—Howse never complained about my leaving the doors open—I have never heard that he has complained of my doing so—I have heard him complant of the doors being left open—he has never complained to me or in my hearing that it made the property of the house insecure—he did not assign any reason for complaining of the doors being left open Q What beer was it that you were going to show Bull that day A Previous to his lordship s death he requested me to brew some beer for him and I had brewed three times in succession for his lordship—I had some that was brewed and some also that was working—I wanted to show Bull some that was then in a state of fermentation—I do not know where Howse was at the time I asked Bull to look at the beer—he was not in the pantry—I should think he had left five or six minutes—I am not certain—I did not see him when I went out of the pantry with Bull to look at the beer—if I had I should have noticed him—there are a great number of doors in the area—two of those places are the servants water-closets—some of them are unoccupied—there are things locked up in them—one of them is used as a brushing-place to brush shoes in—they are all occupied with somethings or other—I look into the places almost daily not in every one of them—the keys were left in the water-closets and the brushing-place—I do not think a key is left in every door—there was a key in the further one I know and I think there were keys in the water-closets and yes I think there were keys in all—I hired West—Howse used to request me to do so and to get their characters for his lordship—I also hired Thorpe and Boxall at the request of Howse and his lordship—I should think that was properly Howse s duty as he had not left the service—I did not know West till he came into the service—I am sure of that MR BODKIN Q What family did you live in before you went to Lord Fitzgerald s A With Mr Powell of George-street Hanover-square—Mark Denton is still in that gentleman s service—he went away from Lord Fitzgerald s house I think about twelve o clock that morning—I remember Thorpe going out for the beer—Denton had left before that—I had not heard any complaints by House about the doors being left open at least for three months before—I was very particular about the doors myself his lordship requested me to be so and I was—these doors in the area all open into arched vaults under the pavement of the street—one of them was locked up and 1 believe hardly ever opened—there was no key in that—the servants would have access to all those that were not locked up every day—the door of the housekeeper s room and the pantry door are close together Q Supposing a man to be in the housekeeper s room and drawing the door after him as he came out could be with his hand push open the door of the butler s pantry A I think he could easily without leaving his hold of the door of the housekeeper s room—I think he might turn round and hold the door of the housekeeper s room with his left hand behind him while with his right he could open the pantry-door—standing at the door of the housekeeper s room he would have a view all along the passage that leads to the area steps CATHERINE PARKER I was housekeeper to Lord Fitzgerald and should have been so fifteen months on the 21st of this month—I remember being in his lordship s bed-room on the Saturday morning after he died—I heard the call-bell ring about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve—it turned out that it was for me—I went down stairs to the dining-room—I then saw Howse and found it was him that had sent for me—at that time he was being measured for his mourning—after he was measured he told me I was to go up to the back drawing-room to Mr Cane and speak to him about the females mourning—he came out of the dining-room and told me that—I left him and went to the back drawing-room for that purpose—Howse went down the stairs across the hall down the kitchen stairs in a hurried way—when I had seen Mr Cane I came down stairs immediately—I was a very short time with him—I had got about half-way down the kitchen stairs when I saw Howse at the top of the three stairs going towards his room along the passage—I went before him towards his room—I said Now Mr Howse I will speak to you —I had frequently been in the habit of speaking to him in his own room before that time—when I got to his door he said No go go and put his hand in this way in the direction of my room—that had the effect of preventing me from going into his room—I went to my own room—he followed me—I got into my own room and commenced speaking to him about the mourning and he said I must have a pen and ink —I told him that was not necessary—he said Yes I must —I said Mr Howse you don t want it for I will do justice to the utmost —he went out of my room—he said he wanted the pen and ink to set down some things that I was going to tell him about the mourning—he said he must have a pen and ink—he opened the door about half-way and pulled the door gently after him by his hand not as any one else would do catch it sharp after them—he kept the door in his hand till he got out and pulled it to—I could have seen what was passing in the butler s pantry if the door had been opened—I do not think I could have seen him where I was sitting—if I had got up from my seat I could have seen into the passage—at the time he said he must have a pen and ink there was a pen and ink in my room which he had used occasionally and even brought two or three persons in occasionally to use it in my room—after Howse had gone out of the room and drew the door to I heard footsteps of more than one person—it could not have been more than a quarter of a minute after—it appeared against the mat of my door between the two doors the mat of the pantry door and my door—the noise was a sort of a shuffling of feet—it is a stone pavement—it was a sort of shuffle which people make when carrying something heavy on a stone pavement—he returned to me I think in about half a minute after I heard the noise—he came in shut the door went to my table and took the pen and ink off it with his back towards me—he did not bring in any pen and ink for which he had left the room—his hand shook violently and his face was very red—he looked excited—I was just commencing the conversation and the cook Mrs Williams came to the door—I heard her footsteps coming to the door—he made two strokes with his pen—he made a mark on two pieces of paper which I understood him were bills and that he had brought something wrong—I cannot exactly say what he said—when the cook came into the room she was going to say something—I said Now go we are talking and she went out again—she returned again in about half a minute and said Mr Howse have you sent a box of any kind out of the house for two men have carried it up the area steps —he said No —I asked her what kind of box—she said A box something like a plate chest —I said God bless me run and stop it and I got up immediately—I went out into the passage and called the men as loud as I could call not being aware that they were up stairs—the men came down stairs—I think Thorpe was the first—I do not know what became of Howse—I do not recollect seeing him again till after Mrs Williams came into the house again from the street—when I left the room I think I must have left Howse and Mrs Williams in it but I am not quite sure—when the alarm was given Howse seemed very excited and still his hand trembled—on my return I found him in the passage with a gentleman and followed him up the passage with the policeman No 5 of the B division—I said Mr Howse it was you and you only that let the men out of the pantry with the plate —I did not hear him make any reply—on the Thursday evening the evening before this I remember a tall man of sallow complexion and dark hair coming to see Howse and Howse took him into the pantry—I heard him talking there—I think it must have been about half-past six o clock—I am not quite certain—it was between six and seven—I had never seen the man before to my knowledge—I heard them talking about the quantity of plate that was in the pantry and then I heard him show him the plate closet which he said had been fitted up—I did not see him do so—Howse said to the other man I suppose your master is going to have one fitted up like it —after that he brought him into my room and introduced him—he said Mrs Parker Lord Fitzgerald s housekeeper my friend —the man made a remark about the airiness of my room—it is a very large room and very airy—after he returned from my room he went along the passage and said to Mr Howse What door is that —I did not see the door he pointed to if he pointed at all but Mr Howse replied The wine-cellar door —that is one of the doors in the passage and next adjoining the butler s pantry Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT TALFOURD Q You say you had been there about fifteen months were you hired by the year A No I was only stopping to oblige Lord Fitzgerald—I was not a permanent servant but continued from week to week—I was in the same house with the family of Vincent Eyre Esq eight years before Lord Fitzgerald came and he wished me to continue with him as his housekeeper—Howse was the house steward—he had the superintendence of all the servants—when he came to the house I gave him master keys two of the wine-cellar and two of the plate-closet leading out of the pantry which would enable him to open them at any time and look into them to see that all was right—he had the entire confidence of Lord FitzGerald—I was only in Lord Fitzgerald s room once or twice during his last illness—on two days I was in the adjoining room and backwards and forwards occasionally—Howse was in the room looking through the curtains when poor Lord Fitzgerald died and he was ordered to go out of the room by Dr Tevan for it disturbed his lordship—I had not heard his lordship take leave of him just before that—I did not hear him speak to him Q You say you observed his hand tremble had he not been ill for some time before with a nervous debility A Yes he had been attended by my lord s physician and got much better—I think it was about the beginning of April—I cannot exactly say the time—I do not think he was attended very long by his lordship s physician—there was another medical man who also attended him—his lordship sent for his physician I believe and I think he saw him several times during the week—I was a good deal excited and agitated myself at the time I found the plate-chest gone—the call bell is in the lower passage about opposite Howse s room—it is rung from the passage on the basement story just at the one end of the Passage that goes into my room at the further part of the passage from my room near the kitchen—when I heard the bell ring I was up two pair of stairs—three pairs from the area—I had gone up into that room about twelve o clock and I was there when the bell rung—when I came down I saw Howse in the act of being measured by the tailor—I do not know whether he is the tailor that usually made the servants things—Mr Cane was in the back drawing-room at that time—that is on the first floor from the sitting-room above the dining-room—I went to Mr Cane and received some directions then I went down the first flight of stairs and so down towards Howse s room—he was on the three stairs that come up from the passage to the kitchen—he was not coming down the same flight of stairs as I was—there was a pen and ink in my room on a large side-table at the left-hand side of the fire-place not standing in the centre of the room—I generally settled my business with him in his own room and when there we had a pen and ink—he had two pieces of paper when he went out and drew the door after him and he brought them in again with him—I do not think it was more than half a minute from the time he went out till he returned—I could not say quite—it might be a very little longer—I have been remaining in the house since my lord s death and so have all the servants—we have been talking about the loss of the plate among ourselves saying what an awful thing it was—we have no great deal to do there now—we have frequently talked the matter over together about what we had each seen and heard Q You say Howse made you no answer when you spoke to him about the loss of the plate did not he say Have I not often told you not to leave the drawers open A No not to my recollection—I can swear that did not pass—the first time I was at Queen-square I did not name about the shuffling of the feet—I forgot it—I did remember it but I omitted saying it—I did not remember it while I was giving my evidence but I did before and after—it slipped my memory at that particular time—I had mentioned it before that to my fellow-servants—I think I mentioned it to Smith the butler—I am certain I did to the cook Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q About how soon after you heard the call-bell ring was it that you heard the shuffling of feet by your door A I think it might be from nine to ten minutes—I am not quite certain to the minute—I think it was from a quarter to twenty minutes past twelve when the call-bell rang MR CLARKSON Q Did the pen and ink in your room stand on the same table on which it usually stood A I think it was the same table from whence Howse used it before I used to have only one inkstand in the room but I have now got an inkstand with a drawer in it which I took out of one of the rooms up stairs and I named that to Mr Howse—it was of no use up stairs and I brought it down and put it on the table and Mr Howse took it up and looked at it—he knew well where it stood—I do not think it was more than a fortnight before this robbery but I have it set down at home—I cannot recollect now MARY HAWKINS I was kitchen-maid in the late Lord Fitzgerald s house and know the butler s pantry in which the plate was kept On the day of the robbery about twelve o clock I went there to clean the room—Howse came in there while I was so employed—he asked me where Mrs Parker was—I told him I thought she was up stairs—he asked me to go and see for her as he wanted to speak to her in the dining-room about the mourning—I then rang the call-bell and did not see him go up stairs—I went out into the kitchen soon after and then came back towards the butler s pantry and met two men in the passage carrying a box in a direction from the pantry—I did not suspect anything wrong and stood aside to let them pass—I took no notice of them at all—they passed by me on towards the area—after the call-bell had been rung I had gone back into the pantry—I staid there not three minutes before I went into the kitchen and it was on returning from the kitchen I met the two men—Mrs Williams the cook made a communication to me directly after and after speaking to me she went to the housekeeper s room—I stood outside the door—she went in and Howse and Mrs Parker were talking—she remained there about a minute and came out again—Mrs Parker told her to go along out for she was talking—she came out and returned again into the housekeeper s room directly afterwards and I heard her say Mr Howse have you sent a box of any kind away is there a box of any kind gone away from the pantry —I believe he said No —then an alarm was given that it was missing Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Where is the call-bell A At the corner very nearly opposite Howse s room-door at the bottom floor in the passage where I was at the time—Howse did not tell me to ring the call-bell—we generally ring it when we want any one from up stairs—we must go up stairs or ring the bell—after ringing the bell I went up stairs before I returned to the pantry to the top of the stairs—we generally go up stairs to see some one at the top—I saw the housemaid—she asked me what the bell was for—I said It is for Mrs Parker Mr Howse wants to see her directly —I then went back to the pantry to begin my work again—I left it to go into the kitchen to put some potatoes on for the kitchen dinner—it did not occur to me to do that before I went into the pantry—I put the potatoes on—I had got them all ready before—I was not in the kitchen a minute before I returned again—I went straight towards the pantry—the kitchen door is more than three or four yards from Howse s room—I had been in the employ two months the 10th of this month—the cook was there when I came Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Did you put your potatoes on before you met the men in the passage or after A Before I put them on—I looked at the clock when it was exactly half past twelve and directly after I met the men in the passage WILLIAM WOODBRIDGE I was the late Lord Fitzgerald s valet—when I first heard the alarm of this robbery I was in the dining-room waiting to be measured—I remember Howse leaving the dining-room after being measured—I heard the alarm of the robbery two or three minutes afterwards—after the robbery I saw Mr Cane with Howse in the pantry—I heard Mr Cane ask Howse what the value of the plate was—he said about 50l —Smith the butler was present at the time and he said More like 400l —Howse did not make any answer to that—I know the prisoner Fuller by seeing him frequently at his lordship s house—the last time was about six or seven weeks before the robbery—he came to visit Howse—I have been his lordship s valet about six months—I have not seen Fuller visiting Howse more than twice in the six months—I had seen him frequently before—I was his lordship s footman about six months—I have been twelve months with his lordship altogether on the 9th of next month—I have seen Fuller at the house seven or eight times—I do not know who introduced him to Howse—I have always taken him to Howse s room—I am certain I had seen him there about six or seven weeks before the robbery—I cannot say to a week—he was with Howse in his room the last time I saw him Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q Do you know what Fuller s business is A No—his lordship had many pictures in the house—I do not know that Fuller was employed to move them—I swear I have no knowledge of that—I know he came to visit Howse because when he came he asked for House and I showed him into his room—a great many tradespeople that come to the house ask for Howse—on the death of the last valet his lordship took me—Lord Fitzgerald hired me in the first instance not Howse—I always found Lord Fitzgerald a particularly kind master—I cannot say anything against Mr Howse he always behaved very well to me while I was in the service—he sometimes had an uncouth way of talking to the servants—I never found him a domineering sort of a man—he might have been so to the other servants at times—I never found that there was a marked contrast between the kindness of his lordship s behaviour and that of Howse—I do not know about the other servants I speak of what I have always found him—he was always very mild to me—I have heard him speak indifferently to others—he might have reason for finding fault—he was rude at times but I cannot say that his manner was naturally that of a rude uncouth man—he was so at times certainly—he was not so to me more frequently than otherwise—I have heard him uncivil at times and at times speak at civil as any man could do I speak for myself not for others—his manner was sometimes rough and sometimes not Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q You have seen Fuller at Lord Fitzgerald s twice during the last six months A Yes I think so and the last time was six or seven weeks from the time he was taken into custody which was on Monday the 18th I think the robbery happening on the Saturday—I was examined before the Justice on the Monday—Fuller was examined there CATHERINE WILLIAMS I was cook in the service of the late Lord Fitzgerald I had been so three months on the 27th of May On the Saturday on which this plate was stolen I was in the kitchen all the morning—I remember Mary Hawkins coming there about twelve o clock or half-past to put the potatoes on—she did so and left the kitchen in a few minutes afterwards—when she came into the kitchen Mr Bull was there—he remained there till after the alarm of this robbery was given—when she came in to put the potatoes on she went to stir the fire—I had some rice-milk to make and I said Don t stir the fire Mary there is plenty of time to put on the potatoes —she said No there is not it is half-past twelve —I said Half-past twelve so late as that expressing some surprise—there is no clock in the kitchen there is in the passage—I did not look in the passage—Mr Bull made some observation—I followed Hawkins out of the kitchen—the was about two or three yards before me—she closed the door after her and I opened it to go out into the passage directly after she went out—I went to look for Smith as Mr Bull wanted to go away—when I opened the kitchen door the area door was shutting and I saw a man s hand on the door shutting it—he was outside the door—I heard a box or something knock against the door—I opened the door looked into the area and saw two men carrying a box up the area steps—when I first saw them they were going up the three steps that go up first of all into the area—they are close to the door then you come to a straight piece before you come to the steps again—they were on those steps when I saw them—their backs were towards me and part of their sides—they were carrying it between them—they proceeded with it along the area till they came to the steps—they then went up the steps—they turned when they got to the bend of the stairs and I then saw Fuller s face—he was the first man—he went up the steps backwards—I had not known him before—I should think the other man was about five feet nine or ten inches high a very fine looking man—I thought I had seen him in the house although I did not see his face—the box was a square one and had the appearance of a plate-chest—it appeared to be heavy from the manner in which they carried it—Fuller is the man whose face I saw and it struck me directly when I saw the other man taking the box that he was a friend of Mr Howse—I thought it was the man who had come to see Howse the evening before—I shut the door when I saw the man s hand on the area door and I went to tell Mrs Parker I wondered what Mr Howse had been sending out then because something struck me it was wrong—I then went to Mrs Parker s room—Mr Howse was sitting there—Mrs Parker said Now just go we are talking —I left the room went to the pantry door and knocked at it—no one answered—I looked in and then ran from there to the servants -hall knocked at the door looked in there saw no one ran back to the housekeeper s room again and said Mr Howse have you sent a box or a box of any sort away —he said No — I did not stop in any of these places I went as quick as I could —I said Will you just go into the pantry and see —he did so and said Yes there is one gone —I ran out into the area went to a cabman that was standing just opposite and asked him something—I think I saw Howse standing by a cab when I was making inquiries—a policeman came in a few minutes—I gave him a description of the persons I had seen take the box away—I said to Howse I think Mr Howse I have seen that man the tall dark man come to see you —he did not make any answer—I said nothing more to him at that time—afterwards I was with him in the housekeeper s room and told him it was a very shocking thing—he said Yes it is very shocking —I said Mr Howse it looks like a planned thing —he said it did—I said The men must have been in the house —he said They must —I said Mr William Russell s servant called out of the window and said she had seen a cart there for an hour—he said As for that I have seen two carts standing there all the morning —Mr Smith said Mr Howse if you had seen a cart there that looked suspicious why was not you on the look out —he said he did not take notice of them—he grumbled something to himself but I cannot say what his words were exactly Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT TALFOURD Q Was Smith present at the time this conversation took place A Yes—it was half an hour I think after it happened in the housekeeper s room after the flurry was over—I have always recollected that I had this conversation with Howse—I named it soon after because Mr Howse was very much flurried at the time and very much coloured up and Smith made him that answer—I have always remembered the remark I made that one of the men had come to see him—I described him—I have always remembered this conversation I have been telling—I never forgot it at any time—I always remembered it when examined at Queen—square—I always had the impression that one of the men who I saw carrying the box was a man I had seen in the house before—I am quite certain about that—I did not say anything to Howse about Fuller—I had never seen Fuller before—Smith and me and Howse were present at this conversation—those were the last words I spoke to Mr Howse—Mr Howse hired me but I saw his lordship on the 27th of Feb a day or two before I came—I named this conversation to the police—inspector Mr Moran at the time—I cannot exactly say when I first told him—Howse remained after that conversation I believe but he went up stairs with the intention of going out but Mr Moran stopped him I believe I heard Mrs Parker say so—I did not see him myself—he remained there till the Monday evening—I believe he was taken into custody in the house—I did not see him taken—I know he was there backwards and forwards from time to time—I cannot tell when I first told Moran what I have told to—day—I did not see him till two or three days after I think—I cannot say—I saw him at Queen-square—when we named other things about Mr Howse I named that and Mr Smith recollected it—Mr Smith was very much excited at the time—he could hardly speak—he did recollect the words—I cannot give you any day when I told Moran what I have told today—it was not a week after it was soon after—I think it was before I was examined at Queen-square the second time—I cannot be certain about it at all but I do not think it was very long—I believe it was in the housekeeper s room at Lord Fitzgerald s—I believe in the presence of Mrs Parker—I know I did name it to her whether it was in her room or not I really cannot tell—I believe Moran was not the first person I named it to—it was a common conversation among us—on my oath I cannot tell you where I was when I told it to Moran or whether it was in the house or in the open air—I do not think it was at the Police-office and cannot tell with certainty whether it was in Belgrave-square—I had lived in Lord Fitzgerald s service three months—before that I lived at Captain Bulkeley s at Clewer where I am going back to—I lived with him a year and a half—before that I lived for twelve months at Mr Thurlow s eleven miles from Guilford—I remember something happening about a shawl just before I went away from there—I know what you refer to and if you will allow me I will explain it—there was a valet there named Samuel Ransom and a coachman named Fisher—he was called John Fisher at the house and by Mr Thurlow but I believe he said his name was Ross—I remember his losing a shawl just before I went away—it was taken and hid in a joke by the housekeeper and me—the valet went to Mr Thurlow in a very great rage and said he would find his shawl—we said we had not got it—Mr Thurlow sent for us in and said Mrs Williams give up the shawl —I said I really don t know where the shawl is Sir but I dare say George will find it —he said But I know you have taken it in a lark —I said On my word Sir I don t know any thing at all about it but I dare say George will find it —Mr Thurlow said It is all nonsense to keep it up like this I dare say you have got the shawl —young Mr Thurlow laughed and said Give the shawl up Williams —I said I really don t know where it is —the housekeeper and me said we would not say where the shawl was—George told Mr Thurlow he was sure the shawl was in the kitchen drawer—Mr Thurlow when he came down to look said Let me look in this drawer Mrs Williams —I said Yet I will and I will give you the shawl and I am very sorry I have played the joke so far —I did not like to give it up because I would not be seen in such a trifling thing—Mr Thurlow said it was a stupid thing to play the joke so far—the shawl was found in my kitchen drawer locked up—we were called into the room by Mr Thurlow after prayers—I dare say it was twelve o clock—I repeatedly denied knowing any thing about it—Mr Thurlow said beggars might come in—I said no beggar could come in Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q You saw the tall man that called on Howse the evening before this robbery A Yes—Fuller was not that man—I saw the two men going up the steps with this plate chest—Fuller went first—I at once recognized the tall man—I have always been certain about Fuller—I went with the policeman and saw him in custody at the station on the Monday afternoon following soon after dinner—I dined at one o clock—I am not aware that anybody else was in confinement when I saw him—I saw some people standing there—I do not know whether they were in custody—they were all standing together in the room—I do not know whether they were policemen—they were not in police clothes—I do not know that the policeman is here who went with me into the station-house—the policeman that was in the station at the time it—the valet was there—when I went into the station the policeman said to me Do you know either of these men —I said That is the man and I am certain he is the man—Fuller said Can you swear to me —I said Swear I won t exactly swear to you —he then said Oh she says she won t swear to me —I said Yes I will I will swear to you side face and full face too although you are dressed very differently to what you were the day I saw you —his coat was different—the day I first saw him he had a snuff-coloured cloth coat and the day he was taken he had a kind of pepper and salt dress with pockets at each side—I do not know what stuff they call it—it was not a fustian jacket—I said I will not exactly swear to you —I think those were the words I used—we went directly to Queen-square—before I took the book in my hand—I said I won t swear to this man —the Magistrate said You are come here to speak the truth to the best of your belief —I said I will speak the truth to the best of my belief and I had more confidence in myself when I said so but the word swear had that impression on me but I said I was positive he was the man and so I was MR BODKIN Q After you left Mr Thurlow s service if I understand you rightly you went into the service of Captain Bulkeley A Yes Mrs Thurlow wrote my character to Mrs Bulkeley—it was in consequence of that I entered Captain Bulkeley s service—I am now going back to Captain Bulkeley s service—Captain Bulkeley wrote to me on the Monday after his lordship s death—the reason I said I would not swear to Fuller was because the word swear had such an impression on me—I would speak the truth to the best of my belief and I do believe he is the man—if I had been asked even Will you take your oath I would have said I will but the word swear had such an impression upon me—I believe there were about three or four persons at the station—Fuller was mixed with them MR DOANE Q When you saw Fuller at the police-court was he dressed in the same way that he had been at the station A Yes just the same because we went straight from the police-station to Queen-Square—I think he was dressed the same at every examination but I am not certain—I did not take particular notice RICHARD BULL I live at No 16 Belgrave-terrace Vauxhall-bridge-road I am not in any business—I have been a gentleman s servant—I called at Lord Fitzgerald s house on the day in question to see Smith the butler—Howse came in while I was with him—I was about leaving the house when Smith asked me to go and see his beer that he had been brewing for Lord Fitzgerald—I went with him through the kitchen to the cellar—Smith was then called to go up stairs—I remained in the kitchen with Mrs Williams the cook—I was sitting at the further side of the kitchen opposite the door—Thorpe was sent out by Smith to fetch some beer—I remember his coming in and closing the door after him—I am certain he did so for I heard the door shut to—soon after there was an alarm of the robbery having been committed—I had not moved out of the kitchen from the time Smith left until the alarm was given—I heard them speaking about the robbery at the kitchen door went out and was told of it—from the time I heard the door close when Thorpe came in with the beer until the alarm of the robbery was given I never heard any one come in at this door and I never heard the door open Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT TALFOURD Q When Howse was there had you your hat on or off A Off—I was standing up to the best of my knowledge—I cannot tell whether Howse knew I was going away—he did not know whether I was going to stay or go as far as I know—I did not see him again till after the alarm ANN BARNES I am in the service of Mr William Russell of No 50 Belgrave-square nearly opposite the house of the late Lord Fitzgerald On Saturday the 13th of May in the forenoon I saw a horse and cart standing below the area gate of Lord Fitzgerald s house and a man with it—I believe I saw that cart standing there an hour—I then saw two persons come up the area steps of Lord Fitzgerald s house with a plate chest—that was about half-past twelve—they put the chest into the hinder part of the cart—one man then secured up the cart and the others went and got up into the cart—the other got up directly and all three drove off very quick JURY Q As you saw the cart standing there so long did you take any particular notice of who it belonged to A I did not—I was at the top of the house on the opposite side of the street of which it is the corner ALEXANDER M CULLOCH police-constable B 5 I went to Lord Fitzgerald s house on the day the robbery was discovered and examined the premises—I think a person could get through this scroll in the railing— referring to the model —and drop down into the area—they would have to drop upwards of seven feet—I examined the state of the area immediately under that spot—I found there a quantity of dry dust blown up by the wind into that part of the area it being then dry weather—I found no mark of footsteps and I should deem it impossible that any person could have dropped down on that spot without leaving the impression of footsteps Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q When did you make the examination A About one o clock—immediately after the robbery—I communicated the result of my examination to the inspector of the division immediately—I was not examined at the office—I made a statement at Lord Fitzgerald s—the dust I examined was formed across the area towards the doorway MR BODKIN Q The scroll you speak of is applicable to this short cross will only A The cross part—all along here are high iron palisades— referring to the model WILLIAM FIELD police-constable B 101 On the 15th of May in consequence of what I heard from Woodbridge I went to No 21 George-street Grosvenor-square about half-past twelve o clock and took Fuller into custody—I told him I took him on suspicion of being a party connected with a plate robbery and there was a cart had taken it away which had the tailboard broken—I found a cart outside Fuller s house which had the tailboard broken and which answered the description of the cart—he said that cart had only been out on Saturday the day of the robbery to Covent-garden-market and had returned about eleven—I had mentioned the day on which the robbery was committed—he said he afterwards went out to load some pictures and the cart was not out afterwards—the pictures were not loaded in the cart but in a van—he did not say what time he had come home—he said after going to load the pictures he returned home and was not out afterwards—I took him to Ebury-square station—I then went to Lord Fitzgerald s and desired that Mrs Williams might have the opportunity of seeing him there—I did not go with her to the station Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Have you been examined before A Yes at Mr Bicknell s office—this is the first time I have been examined on oath—I took possession of Fuller s cart and kept it fourteen days—I then sent it back again to Fuller WILLIAM MORAN I am a police-inspector of the B division I took Howse into custody on Monday the 15th of May—I told him that a man was in custody charged on suspicion of stealing Lord Fitzgerald s plate—he said he knew there was it was the man that moved Lord Fitzgerald s pictures Fuller—on the following morning as I was about to take him before the Magistrate he told me he was innocent of the robbery—I told him I knew nothing whatever about that but it was stated that a man was introduced to his lordship s house on the Friday the day previous to the robbery—he said that no person whatever had been to see him on the Friday nor had he introduced anybody to his lordship s house on the evening of that day—he said that in the presence of his brother—I presume it was then pretty well known that Fuller was in custody—after saying it was Fuller that moved Lord Fitzgerald s pictures he said That man I will swear I have not seen for the last six months Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q How long have you been in the police A More than thirteen years—I am not aware that I have often made a mistake in that time—I dare say I have made many mistakes in my life—I am not aware that I have ever made a mistake in the report of a conversation since I have been in the police—I do not swear it positively—I will swear to the words House made use of—I positively swear I could not have mistaken the word months for weeks JAMES DIGNUM I am an attorney by profession I am a prisoner in Horsemonger-lane gaol for debt—I know the prisoner Howse—he called on me while I was confined in Horsemonger-lane gaol—I do not remember on what day he first called—I had heard something about the state of Lord Fitzgerald s health at that time—I had read in the Times newspaper of his lordship s state of health—I cannot say whether it was the day I read that account that Howse first called on me—I think he called on me before his lordship s death Q Now in the course of conversation between you and Howse did any thing transpire on the subject of his lordship A Why I should appeal to his Lordship whether I am bound to divulge any thing which on that occasion took place between Mr Howse and myself COURT Q What objection can there be to divulging it A It might have been a confidential communication—I am an attorney of the Court—I do not know whether I had any case in hand for Howse but I appeal to your Lordship with great deference and respect—I object to answer that question unless you desire me COURT You bound to answer MR CLARKSON Q Now what did he say if any thing about Lord Fitzgerald or his affairs Witness I had rather not answer that question Court But you must answer it is not a matter of choice whether you would rather or not Witness My Lord I must take the consequences on myself I will not answer the question I claim your Lordship s protection I am an attorney of the Courts COURT Your being an attorney is no reason for not answering the question—I warn you if you do not answer the question I shall commit you Witness Well what is the question MR CLARKSON Q Whether any conversation took place between you and Howse about Lord Fitzgerald A Yes—he said his lordship was very dangerously ill and was not likely to survive—and he asked me if I could get a person that he could depend upon—I said You have been a very old and faithful servant of Lord Fitzgerald and I think you had better leave well alone —he said Well I mean to take care of myself —I have nothing more to say—he said nothing more—I said As you have been a very old and faithful servant I have no doubt his lordship has taken care of you and you had better let well alone —I said that with truth and honour to him—he said the lawyer brought a codicil which he had witnessed a day or two before and he had witnessed the signature of Lord Fitzgerald Q Recollect as well as you can the precise words he used about the person whom he asked for A On my word I cannot recollect the precise words—he said he wanted a right sort of man COURT Q For what A Why to assist him in some speculation of his own MR CLARKSON Q Was that the language he used A He did not use the word speculation —he said he wanted a man that he could depend upon—he said nothing more—he did not explain to me the object for which he wanted him—nothing was mentioned in the course of conversation about any property of Lord Fitzgerald s—I gave him an account of such persons as he asked for—I said there was Mr Pooke in Bedford-street Covent-garden and a man of the name of Lawrence who bought stolen plate—that is what I told him—Mr Clarkson are you justified in putting these questions to me because I may criminate myself —I cannot recollect whether I told him that on the first or second occasion—I told him they were parties who were in the habit of purchasing stolen property—I told him who those parties were from my professional knowledge as yours may be—I knew the parties who would buy stolen property—I told him If you have any stolen plate or any property of that description there are parties who live not very far from you that will buy it of you I dare say but I recommend you to steer clear of all those transactions —he told me that he meant to take care of himself—Howse fetched some wine—he brought a pint of sherry to me I believe—I do not know how much it was—I did not measure it—it was brought in a quart bottle—the regulation of the prison is that we shall have half-a-pint or a pint of wine a day or a pint of porter and he brought a-pint of wine—when he left me on that occasion he told me to get a man that he could depend upon—he did not say when he should come again—I remember reading the announcement of Lord Fitzgerald s death in the newspaper—I think it was the day before I read that that Howse came again—I cannot recollect at what time it was about the middle of the day—he then told me that his lordship was dead that he died with his hand in his and he meant to take care of himself—he meant to have the horses and carriages—I said Don t make a fool of yourself I have no doubt from your faithful services that Lord Fitzgerald has taken care of you provided for you —I do not remember saying anything about the funeral—he asked me if I could tell him any persons that would buy some plate—it was then that I mentioned to him the names of the two persons I have already given—he said they were a very bad lot he did not like them—I cannot say whether Howse was acquainted with either of those persons I think he knew them—I am not sure whether he did or not—I do not recollect anything else that transpired on that second conversation—I afterwards made a communication to Mr Bicknell one of Lord Fitzgerald s executors in consequence of which he visited me—that was after I had heard of the robbery Cross-examined by MR SERGEANT TALFOURD Q When was it you made the communication to Mr Bicknell A I cannot recollect I made no memorandum—it was immediately after the transaction—I do not now recollect the day on which I made it—it was immediately after the interview with Mr Howse—I cannot say whether I made it on the same day or not—I made it soon after I know MR CLARKSON Q Was the communication you made to Mr Bicknell in writing A It was MR SERGEANT TALFOURD Q Was it on the same day or not A I cannot say whether it was or not—I made it in writing sir—whether I sent that writing on the same day on which Howse had this conversation with me I do not know—I did not know at the time I made that communication that a reward of 100l had been offered—I swear that—there was no reward that I know of at that time—I never heard of any reward being offered—you are the first person that has intimated to me that there is a reward—I never knew it before Q When was the time you mentioned to Howse the names of Mr Pooke and some one else A What he called Jack Pooke and Sam Lawrence who are receivers of stolen property Q I thought you had named them to him A I said If you want to deal in that way you had better go to those parties but I advise you to have nothing to do with them —I cannot tell whether it was at the first or second interview that I mentioned those names to Howse—we had I think two or three interviews—I should say two—I cannot say—I will not confine myself to two or three—there might have been more—there were not more than three but I would rather say two—I have been in Horsemonger-lane gaol nearly two months and I think the debts against me are about 13l or 14l —I have eleven children Q Have you often been in prison before A I was in Horsemonger-lane before and I paid my debts—I was in the Queen s Bench when his lordship presided for horsewhipping an attorney—I think that is nearly all the prisons I have been in—I can tell you—I will go into the history of my life—I was committed to the Queen s Bench by the sentence of the court for the assault on the attorney and I think about twenty-five years ago I was tried for an offence which I will not name here because there are ladies present—it was for an assault and I was honourably acquitted—those are the only times I have been in prison—I was never in prison for fraud conspiracy or perjury or for keeping a gaming-house—I was indicted as I tell you for horsewhipping an impudent attorney—I have never been in the habit of giving advice where persons could dispose of stolen property—I never mentioned the names of persons who would purchase—I cannot say whether it was before or after I mentioned those names to Howse that the wine was fetched—I am very poor Mr Serjeant Talfourd—I have got eleven children—there is no great crime in poverty I think in this country—I have done some professional business for Howse—I wrote to him before he called on me—I cannot say how soon after I wrote to him he called on me—it was very soon afterwards—it was not a month—I cannot say whether it was a week—I should say it was a day or two afterwards Q What was your object in writing to him A Why I have known the man a long time and I respected the man—I knew him when he was in the Navy—my object in writing to him was not to borrow money—perhaps I said I regretted to hear of his difficulties and should be very glad to see him or something of that kind Q What difficulties A He was apprehended for a felony when I wrote to him COURT Q You were asked whether you wrote to him before he came to you in the prison A I think when I came into that prison for debt for a few pounds if my recollection serves me I wrote to Mr Howse to say that I was in Horsemonger-lane gaol for debt and I think in consequence of that he called on me—I do not know how long that was before he called on me—I made no memorandum ALEXANDER BATEMAN I am lodge turnkey of Horsemonger-lane gaol— I remember the prisoner Howse coming there in a gig with a servant in livery about a month ago or it might not be above three weeks or it might be five weeks I do not recollect—he asked for a person named Dignum—we had the witness Dignum in custody there at that time—he is brought up here to-day by habeas—after asking for Dignum he went into the gaol—he asked me if wine was allowed to come in—I am not positive whether that was before he went in or whether he came out for it—I said If the gentleman has not had his beer —I took up my list and saw he had not had his beer—I said a pint of wine was allowed and I allowed a pint of wine to go in—Howse took it in—I think he went and fetched it—I am not positive as to that but a pint of wine came in—the gig was waiting there for some considerable time—a question was put to me by the governor of the gaol about that gig and the person that was with it and I gave him an answer—I think Howse was in the prison altogether an hour if not more but I cannot positively say CHARLES STEPHEN FRYER I am one of the turnkeys on the debtors side of Horsemonger-lane gaol I had a person named Dignum in custody there for debt about four or five weeks ago—I remember Howse coming there to inquire for him—I opened the gate for him—I saw no gig—I am turnkey of the inner-gate—he went out after he had been in some time and returned a second time with some wine in a bottle—he staid somewhere about an hour or an hour and a half—he came again to the best of my recollection on the following day—he did not stay quite so long that time JOHN PATTEN I am confined in Horsemonger-lane gaol for debt I know Dignum who is also confined there About four or five weeks ago I remember a person coming to speak to Dignum in the gaol—I cannot say how long I saw them in conversation—I saw him talking to Dignum—I did not see him leave—when he first came before he was admitted within the inclosure which confines the prisoners Dignum said That is Mr Howse —to the best of my recollection Howse is the person JOHN LAURENCE BICKNELL ESQ I have been for many years a solicitor residing in London I was concerned for the late Lord Fitzgerald in his lifetime and am one of his executors—I produce the probate of his will—I received a communication in writing from a person of the name of Dignum—I knew nothing of him until that time—in consequence of the contents of that communication I went to Horsemonger-lane gaol to Mr Dignum—I think the prisoners had then been fully committed for trial—it was on Friday in the last week that I went to Dignum—Lord Fitzgerald died on the 11th of May—the day before I prepared a codicil at his lordship s house which he executed there—Howse was one of the witnesses to it and Smith the butler the other—I am not aware that any one knew of such an instrument having been executed except myself the persons before whom it was executed and the family Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q How soon after receiving that communication did you see Dignum A I was just going off to South-ampton and immediately took a cab and went up to the place—I saw him within half an hour—the two prisoners Were in custody long before that and I think had been fully committed EDWARD CANE ESQ I was confidential secretary to the late Lord Fitzgerald and am one of his executors I made an arrangement of my own accord with regard to the servants mourning—I thought it probable that the establishment would be broken up and merely ordered plain mourning for them not livery mourning—I directed them to continue in the service till they received the warning that is usually given—the tailor was a person engaged by myself—the executors have paid the servants the wages due to them and for their services since his lordship s death—I resided in the house some few days after his lordship s death as one of the executors Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q When did you give the tailor order to come to the house A I sent for him on the Friday evening but none of the servants in the house could have known it because I sent my own servant—I was in the house during the time the servants were being measured—I had seen Howse shortly before that—I think I had given him instructions to see that the servants attended the tailor Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Are you acquainted with Fuller s father A No I was not aware of his father being sometimes engaged by his lordship to purchase pictures for him nor of the prisoner Fuller being employed at any time to carry any such pictures—my connexion with Lord Fitzgerald was in a public capacity but I knew a great deal of his private arrangements—I knew of his having pictures at Whitehall and having them removed from his residence there six or seven weeks before the robbery to his residence in Belgrave-square—I do not remember who they were brought by MR CLARKSON Q You say you ordered the tailor and saw him on Friday night A I did not see him—my servant saw him—I did not communicate with Howse on the Friday night—the tailor came quite unexpectedly by the servants MR DOANE called the following witnesses on behalf of Fuller ELIZABETH WITHAM I am a dressmaker I lodge with the prisoner Fuller s wife and have done so five weeks in George-street Grosvenor-square—I came on the Friday the 12th of May—I remember Fuller leaving home next morning about half-past nine o clock to go to Covent-garden market with one of his men and his horse and cart—I saw him from the window go away with his horse and cart—he returned about a quarter to eleven and went away again directly after putting a horse in his van and went to Bond-street to load some pictures—I saw him leave with the horse and van—I saw him again at twenty minutes to twelve—about ten minutes before twelve he went and put up a bag of wood in the cart and went up to Portugal-street with a young lad—he returned at a quarter after twelve for money for a bill which I saw him take from a drawer in the room—he went out with it to go to Oxford-street—he returned at twenty minutes to one to dinner—I dined with him and his wife at one o clock—the first time he went out after dinner was about half-past two as near as I can guess—I attended before the Magistrate MR CLARKSON Q Have you carried on the business of a dressmaker for any length of time A Not lately I have not—before I went to lodge with Mrs Fuller I carried on my business at No 29 King-street Islington with my mother—before that I had been living as servant with a lady in the Liverpool-road for twelve months—I am no relation of Fuller s—I knew his wife before she was married and had been a fellow-servant with her and on leaving service I returned to her—I did not go to my mother s because I preferred coming up to this end of the town to going to my business again—I did not exactly intend to go to dress-making when I went to Mrs Fuller s—Mrs Fuller was ill and I attended to her—I was doing nothing at all at this time—I have very respectable friends—I did not pay Mrs Fuller for my board and lodging—I am staying there as a friend—the cart which Fuller went with at nine o clock was the cart which had the tailboard broken—he has only one cart—I believe it was broken when he went out—I noticed it—I came there about five o clock on Friday afternoon—the first I saw of the cart was at nine next morning—I did not take particular notice of it then—Dunn went with him at nine—he went out with the van about a quarter to eleven and returned at twenty minutes to twelve with the van gave the man 1s and a nose-bag and went out again at ten minutes before twelve with the same cart that he had gone out with at nine o clock—the tailboard was then hanging down and was a little broken—I took particular notice of it then as he was putting the bag of wood into the cart—I was standing at the window—a lad named George Hattersley went with him with the wood to Portugal-street MR DOANE Q Was this a chaise-cart A No Fuller had no chaise-cart JOHN CHAPLIN I am a picture-dealer and live at No 88 New Bond-street I had desired Fuller to call on me on Saturday the 13th of May—he came about twenty minutes past eleven o clock with a horse and van and a man to remove pictures—they were packed up in the van and they left about a quarter or twenty minutes to twelve as near as I can guess—I was before the Magistrate three different times ready to be examined WILLIAM HENRY VINES I am in Fuller s service as carman and live in Pancras-street Tottenham-court-road On Saturday the 13th of May I went with Fuller to Mr Chaplin s in New Bond-street—after we left Bond-street we went together as far as the end of George-yard which leads from George-street into Duke-street Grosvenor-square close to the prisoner s house—we there parted—he was to send a lad down with money for coals—after I had received the money for the coals and victuals for the horses I went towards Hendon and Fuller went towards his house GEORGE HATTERSLEY I am thirteen years of age I know Fuller—on the Saturday before he was taken into custody I saw him at his door about a quarter to twelve o clock and asked his permission to ride in his cart—I went in the cart with him into Portugal-street—he had a bag of wood in the cart—we went to the house of a gentleman named Manson in Portugal-street—I know the time because I saw the clock of Grosvenor chapel in South Audley-street—it was five minutes to twelve by it—he delivered the wood to a female-servant of Mr Manson s—we then went round the other side of the square came down Duke-street into Oxford-street and so into George-street—a man named Dunn who is in Fuller s service put up the horse and cart in the stable—I then went home to dinner MR CLARKSON Q Look at that clock what is the time by that A Twenty-five minutes to six ESTHER LONG I am single and live at Mr Manson s No 5 Portugal-street Grosvenor-square I remember Fuller coming to the house on Saturday the 13th of May with some wood about twelve o clock—I know the time because I expected the butcher and seeing the cart stop I thought it was the butcher—he came in a cart with a little boy—he did not stay many minutes—I did not see him at all before the Justice MR CLARKSON Q Why did you not go before the Justice A I was not asked to go MR DOANE Q Were you at the office though you were not examined A Yes but I was not inside the room—I was there waiting to be examined HOWSE— GUILTY Aged 52 — Transported for Fifteen Years FULLER— NOT

fourpenny-piece—I had lost about 25l in gold and silver—there were sovereigns half-sovereigns half-crowns and a great many fourpenny-pieces—I got an officer and found Henrietta Haywood at her father s

we found these ten cigars three tobacco pipes and the rest of the things that are mentioned in the indictment William Haywood I had no knowledge that there was anything stolen on my premises—they were found in a box Witness They were in two boxes one locked the other not—William Haywood refused to give the key of the box till the officer insisted on it—the greater part of these things were found in

know he lived in that room because when he came home the people in the house said Here comes the father —he came into that room of his own accord and produced the key of the locked box—I know these things—I cannot say when I lost them—I did not miss them till the 3rd of June—it was owing to the other discovery that I went to the house and found these things—William Haywood had some duplicates

come out of No 38 with a man called Long Tom—they went down several streets till they came to Clerkenwell and went into a public-house by the Sessions House— I had not followed them twenty yards before they saw me watching them and they separated —when they came out I followed the prisoner—he went up Mutton-hill—I saw a broker and borrowed a white apron and still followed him on to Tottenham Court-road—he stood and looked at me—he then went on—I followed him to Oxford-street and then he went down a turning to Oxford-market—I saw a policeman and told him to watch him—he then ran off as hard as he could—I went round Marylebone-lane and met him coming out that way—I followed him back up to Regent-street—I then went and said Who are you Where do you live —he said I shall give you no information —he said I had no authority—I showed him my staff and told him I was an officer and took him to the station—he gave the name of George Greville 38 Somerset-place—he said he was out of employ—I then took him to the Hoxton station in the neighbourhood of Somerset-place and said I charge you on suspicion of stealing a quantity of goods shirts and other things the property of a person unknown —he said he knew nothing about them—I found a bunch of keys on him—I and the other officer went to the house in Somerset-place leaving the prisoner at the station—I saw Dowson at the house and

handkerchiefs pawned on the 20th of June and two handkerchiefs pawned on the 25th of June six shirts pawned on the 4th of July two pairs of silk stockings on the 12th of Aug five shirts on the 19th of

of July and three shirts on the 12th of July all pawned by Dowso—I never remember Greville pawning anything—here is one of our duplicates found at her room relating to a shawl and three pairs of hose pawned by Dowson on the 19th of August Cross-examined Q How can you tell us that Dawson pledged these things A From memory and likewise from my own handwriting on the duplicates—I cannot tell how she was dressed—I quite remember seeing her—perhaps 200 persons come in to pawn in the course of the day—she came alone on the 23rd—I will not swear that her servant was not with her on the 12th of Aug —her servant did not pledge the goods on the 23rd—her servant has pawned several times—I sometimes put down the name of Greville and sometimes the servant s name—a great many duplicates have been returned—none of them were for things pawned at our shop THOMAS WALDUCK I live in the Hackney-road—I was in the service of Pickford and Roberts pawnbrokers in the Old-street-road—on the 11th of Nov a handkerchief and sheet were pawned in the name of Ann Greville—this is the duplicate I gave—I do not remember the person SAMUEL ROSE I am assistant to Mr Shepherd a pawnbroker—I have two stocks pawned

the name of John Williams six sheets on the 13th of April by Dowson six shirts on the 22nd of April in the name of John Williams—I find the duplicates of all these among those produced by the officer Cross-examined Q Do you speak positively to those pawned in July A Yes—I have known Dowson some time—I remember taking them—I made out the duplicates JOHN MILLS re-examined I do not know these things by any mark but I had in my stock articles corresponding with these—I have missed them from my stock—the shirts were made by persons for me HENRY ROGERS I am a shirt-maker in Addle-street and supply the prosecutor—all the shirts produced by Cressey are my make and two others also Cross-examined Q Do you make anything but shirts A No—I supply many persons besides the prosecutor—the shirts I make vary according to the parties we sell them to—we put a distinct mark for each customer—Mr Mills has not a particular mark—I cannot tell when I sold these except from the book—all the shirts had a particular mark and all of them were sold to Mr Mills—these have not got that mark—I could not swear to whom they were sold MR BODKIN Q These six shirts produced by Cressey were part of twelve dozen that bore a particular mark and were all sold to the prosecutor and these have this particular mark A Yes MR DOANE Q When was it you sold them A Between three and four months ago while the prisoner

t18430612-2064  2064 HENRY WILLIAM HIDE and GEORGE FREDERICK GWYTHER were indicted for stealing on the 7th of June 4 yards of woolen cloth value 2l and 3 yards of kerseymere 1l the goods of Harry Winterbourne and another their masters MESSRS CLARKSON and DOANE conducted the Prosecution HARRY WINTERBOURNE I am partner with Mr Gray we are tailors and drapers at Nos 70 and 71 Blackman-street Borough—Hide was our foreman—it was his duty to keep the stock and to give out all the goods to the tailors who were at work for us—he was to keep a book in which he was to enter all the goods that he gave out—Gwyther was a tailor who has worked for us out of the house rather under twelve months—in consequence of information I applied to Mr Stevens and caused this letter looking at it to be written—it was sent to Stevens who lived in the same house with Gwyther at No 132 Great Suffolk-street on Monday the 5th of June—on Tuesday the 6th I had some black cloth in from the damper s—it was put in a place where the customers do not usually go to be rolled next morning—I saw them there safe till ten o clock on Wednesday morning the 7th when it was taken to be rolled—I saw Gwyther in my shop on that Wednesday morning about nine o clock and I saw him there as late as twelve o clock when I saw him go away he had a bag with him very full indeed—the same afternoon I saw one yard and three-quarters of superfine black cloth and three yards of kerseymere in possession of Stevens in Great Suffolk-street—they were our property—the kerseymere had been previously marked in my presence—this is the piece of black cloth and here is a particular notch on the edge of each of them—the ends of both correspond—the one yard and three-quarters correspond at one end with the bulk and at the other with a piece that was torn off—this piece of cloth should have measured eighten yards and a quarter but it just two yards deficient—I was present the same afternoon when Gwyther s apartment was searched and I found there a quarter of a yard of cloth which being joined to the one yard and three-quarters would make the entire of the roll and account for the whole deficiency—a piece of cloth measuring two yards was produced by Mr Worley a pawnbroker—it matched in cutting with a piece of cloth in my stock and I missed this on Wednesday night—there is no entry in my books of either of these pieces of cloth—I have looked through the books—this is the book producing it in which it was Hide s duty to have entered them if they had been given to the tailors for work for us—Gwyther was taken into custody—I then went to my shop to Hide and Mr Gray my partner asked Hide in my presence how that piece of black cloth came to be cut—he said he had given it out to make a coat for an order which stood in the book at a blue coat for a man of the name of M Carthy—I said How is that when the order stands for a blue coat —he said The man has altered his mind from a blue to a black —I said How does it happen you have not altered the order-book —he said I cannot tell in my hurry I forgot it —I said If this is the case what is become of the piece of blue cloth —he said I have had it back again —I said Where is it if you have had it back again produce it —he said I do not know where it is I cannot be answerable for cloth that I have had back some days —I sent for M Carthy and gave Hide into custody Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Was Gwyther occasionally employed by you out of the house A I gave him the work if he liked to do it himself or to give it to others—he was formerly in the habit of buying cloth at our house but not since he hat worked for us that I am aware of—he has not worked for us twelve months—he began to work in the end of 1842 for us—I think he had goods on credit in September last—Hide would have the cutting out for work or for sale Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q When was Hide given into custody A On Wednesday the 7th—the parting with these goods took place on that day—from my youth I was induced to believe my name was Harry Downton Winterbourne till I found by the register of my baptism that it was only Harry—I dropped the name of Downton about five years ago and have not signed it to since WILLIAM STEVENS I am a journeyman tailor and lived at No 132 Great Suffolk-street The prisoner Gwyther then lived in the same house and I worked for him—in consequence of directions I received in a letter from the prosecutor on Monday the 5th of June I called Gwyther into my room I showed him the letter and told him to read it and said I had not the means of executing the order could he befriend me in doing so—he said Yes I will make it all right —on the same afternoon he called me into his room and said he should not be able to get that for me till the Wednesday as there were about thirty pieces of cloth out at the damper s and they would not come home till Tuesday he would try what he could do—on the Wednesday morning I met him at a public-house about two doors from the prosecutor s—I asked if he had got that for me—he said No I can t get this for you there I shall get it for you at another place —I came home with him he called me to his room and said I will do that for you between one and two o clock or between three and four for certain —at twenty minutes past three he brought the cloth into my room loosely wrapped up in a piece of paper—he said Here Stevens is the cloth I have been to my uncle and asked him to do me the favour to get it from his draper s to his account —he said the 1 3/4 yards of black broad cloth was 14s 9d and three yards of kerseymere was 7s 6d a yard—I delivered up the cloth to Garnett the policeman that night Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Is Mr Winterbourne s a tally-shop A I believe so—goods are sold on security and paid for by small weekly instalments—I did not wish Gwyther to become my security for some cloth to be got on credit—I had spoken to him about getting cloth—I always thought as he was employed there he could have it—I never asked him to be answerable for the payment for some cloth for me—I wanted him to procure this cloth—I do not know how it was to be got—I meant to pay ready money for it—I should have made the money to have paid for this—I suppose pledging would have been the only means—my own name is Joseph Treleaven—I go in my mother s name but they inquired at the station and they said it was no consequence—I use the name of Stevens on account of the bother of my own name being a curious name in the workshop where there are many men—it is not every one that could recollect it—I went by the nickname of William Williams but never took to that name in any shop—I never went by the name of William Foale that I know of—I have not made use of that name—it is my sister s name—I have been called William Foale because I worked for Mr Foster in Aldgate my sister went home with my work and when he asked she gave her name instead of mine but when I left him I took to my own name—I went back to the name of Stevens three or four years ago and I have gone by that name ever since MR DOANE Q Did you tell the Magistrate that your real name was Treleaven A Yes—no charge has ever been made against me in any of my names SOLOMON GARNETT police-constable M 70 On Wednesday evening the 7th of June I went to Gwyther s house with the prosecutor—Stevens was at the house and I received from Stevens three yards of kerseymere and one yard and three quarters of black cloth—I told Gwyther what I took him for—I had the cloth in my hand—he did not make any answer—I found in Gwyther s room this quarter of a yard of black cloth—I have examined it—it matches the cloth which I produce—I found a duplicate relating to the piece of blue cloth on the 5th of June and one relating to the piece of rifle-green cloth on the 7th of June—I then took Hide—I told him it was for robbing his master of a piece of black cloth—he did not make any answer but walked out of the shop Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Did you find a bill there A Yes—Mr Winterbourne told me to take it away Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q What time did you take Hide A Between five and six o clock in the afternoon MR WINTERBOURNE re-examined I was present when these duplicates were found at Gwyther s place—this bill was there—it is dated the 23rd of May 1843—it is for rifle green cloth—it is the writing of Benjamin Alexander my clerk GEORGE WORLEY I am in the service of a pawnbroker I produce a Piece of rifle-green cloth pawned by Jones on the 7th of June about two yards as near as possible and a piece of blue cloth pawned I think by Jones on the 5th of June GRANTHAM JONES I am a journeyman tailor and live in Great Suffolk-street I have worked for Gwyther three years On the 5th of June he gave me this piece of blue cloth to pawn at Mr Worley s for 13s —I gave Gwyther the money and the ticket—on the 7th of June I received two yards of rifle green cloth from Gwyther to pawn—pawned it for 13s and gave him the money and the ticket Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q You know of Gwyther dealing at the prosecutor s house for cloth A Yes—I have several times pawned cloth that he has had on credit by his desire DANIEL M CARTHY I am a labourer and live at Paul s-wharf Upper Thames street On the 30th of May I went to Mr Winterbourne s shop—I saw Hide there—I ordered a suit of clothes of him a dark blue frock-coat and a black kerseymere waistcoat and trowsers—I received them last Saturday night—I did not go to Hide and order a black coat instead of a blue one and never received a black one from him BENJAMIN ALEXANDER I am the prosecutor s clerk On the 7th of June I remember assisting Hide to roll up some cloth about the middle of the morning—Hide asked me about twenty minutes before twelve o clock to go to the public-house about two doors off to have some stout—I refused—he pressed me two or three times to go out of the shop before him—I then went and left him behind in the shop—when I got to the public-house I saw Henry the mattress-maker and Gwyther there—Gwyther asked me if Hide was not coming—I told him I thought he was not as it was near his dinner time—I had a glass of stout and after I had drank that Hide came in alone—he had a glass of stout and then immediately went away—Gwyther followed him immediately leaving me and Henry in the public-house—I staid there about a quarter of an hour and then went back Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q I suppose you were in the habit of going there at dinner or in the middle of the day A Very often—it is a sort of house of call for people belonging to our house—I do not sell goods for my master—I am in the counting-house—I made out this bill— looking at it —Hide sold this cloth—I do not remember any other rifle cloth being sold to Gwyther previous to this—Hide would sell it and come to me to make the bill—he might sell this cloth and not come to me THOMAS HENRY I am a mattressmaker in the prosecutor s service On the 7th of June about a quarter to twelve o clock in the morning I went into the shop and saw Gwyther standing there with a small empty bag in his hand—I staid there about five minutes—I did not speak to him—I asked Hide who was behind the counter about a mattress which I had to make—I did not see him and Gwyther speak together—Gwyther was on the other side of the counter—when I came away Gwyther followed me out and asked if I would take a glass of ale—I went with him to a public-house and had something to drink—in a little time Alexander came in—Hide came in had a glass of beer and went out immediately—he was the last that came in and the first that went out—Gwyther followed him some time after—I believe he still had the bag Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Was there any one else there A Yes Johnson another shopman—nobody else BENJAMIN ALEXANDER examined by MR BALLANTINE I keep the greater part of the prosecutor s books—there are seven or eight persons in the employ—there are nine in the house and five out-door workmen—tailoring orders ought to be entered in this book—cloth to be made up for customers is entered in this book—Hide is the only person that enters in this book—he keeps the book and enters them as customers come in—the tailors generally measure and Hide puts down the measure with the names to it—the book is always kept by him—if he has not got the book he does not put it down on paper but in a memorandum-book and copies it into this book—the men s book is at the shop MR DOANE Q Suppose M Carthy had ordered a coat waistcoat and trowsers was it Hide s duty to have it entered in this book A It was HARRY WINTERBOURNE re-examined This two yards of rifle green cloth found at the pawnbroker s I know—this is a piece of blue pawned on the 5th—this is entered in my book as given to Gwyther for M Carthy s coat—this 1 3/4 and 1/4 correspond—these cuttings correspond with my whole piece—the contrary end will match this short bit and here is the fag-end making the whole length complete—this is the invoice which I received from Lupton of Leeds relating to this blue cloth and the piece of rifle MR BALLANTINE Q You charge the prisoners with stealing the rifle and the blue A The rifle and the black—when I charged Hide with stealing the black I did not know of the deficiency of the rifle—it was the black that Hide said was exchanged for the blue—I did not know of the rifle till I returned from the station MR DOANE Q Was it through the ticket you discovered the cloth was pawned A Yes COURT to WILLIAM STEVENS Q Was any thing said as to where this cloth was to come from A I was not to know where it came from—he did not tell me where it was to come from—I understood at first that it was to come from Mr Winterbourne s - - Johnson and - - Josephs in the prosecutor s employ Jeremiah Taylor builder New Kent-road and John Charlton greengrocer John Mann cheesemonger

of cloth called worsted scarlet 2s and 6 yards of worsted plush 7s the goods of Robert Robins and others the masters of Griffiths to which GRIFFITHS pleaded Guilty —Aged 25 Recommended to mercy Confined One Year MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution ROBERT ROBINS I my father and my brother are in partnership together as cap-makers in Houndsditch We occupy five houses behind ours—Griffiths was our clerk and foreman for three years down to the 8th of July—Lethborg came into our service about three years since and left about the beginning of January—his wife had been taught the trade on our premises—on Saturday the 8th of July I received information which caused me to have inquiries made about some goods—I received a communication from Griffiths—I was not aware that Lethborg was the proprietor of any shop in the same line of business—I went to Lethborg s shop within an hour after I had received the communication with two officers—I found there were caps there of what we call No 132 and some we call naughts—Lethborg s shop is in Worship-street—I found him at home and took him into custody—I told him it was for receiving stolen goods—I searched his premises and found a number of cap-tops and other things—we purchase them in this state—we could not miss them our stock is so very large—this worsted plush is ours—here is a piece of gingham that I believe to be ours—it has our mark on it—this other piece of plush I have no doubt is ours—I asked Lethborg who marked these things—he said he did—I asked for the pattern—he produced one which was too large and then he said he must have lost it—I asked if he could not tell me where he bought the gingham—he said he could not but it could not be ours it was commoner than we used—I examined and found it was of the best quality we ever used and is made for us—I asked where he bought the cap-tops—he said Of a man over the water —I asked where—he said he could not tell but he had been to his house—I asked where his house was—he could not tell—I asked whether it was near Southwark Westminster or London-bridge—he could not tell—I asked the name—he said he did not know—here is other property which from the appearance and trimmings I have no doubt are ours—I never knew two houses that trim exactly alike—they all make a difference in the manner of trimming—there are some things here which I do not like to swear to—I believe the whole of the articles mentioned in this indictment to be ours Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Who did you receive information from A Our porter named Charles and then Griffiths spoke to me—I have not missed any portion of this property I believe it to be ours from its being similar to part of our stock and bearing certain marks—we get this plush from Glasgow—it has the hand-writing of a cutter in our employ—the marks could not be made till it got to our cutting-room—Griffiths had access to every part of our premises—he might have waited on customers that came but we did not sell any goods in London—this plush is worth about 6s —we supply other shops in the country but not in London MR CLARKSON Q Had Griffiths any authority to sell goods to Lethbrog A No Lethborg did not say he bought any goods of Griffiths or of any one on our premises—he had no right on our premises after he left in January BENJAMIN STEDMAN I was porter to the prosecutors for nearly three months—I left about six weeks ago—there was a person named Perceval in their employ—Griffiths was in the service at the time—Lethborg was not—the side gates of my master s premises lead into Cock and Hoop-yard—the gates merely lead into the yard for the reception of goods—on a Saturday morning about eight o clock I was with Perceval and another person—it is about three months ago—something passed from me to my fellow-servant and I went into Fire Ball-court to watch—there is a stair-case which leads to a door-way in Cock and Hoop-yard and then to Fire Ball-court—I saw Lethborg come out of Cock and Hoop-yard at the back of our premises—he had a bag on his shoulder—Griffiths came out of the same court directly after—I did not speak to either of them—they went by me—on the following Saturday I saw Lethborg up Cock and Hoop-yard opposite Mr Robins s premises—I said if he did not instantly go away I would give him in charge—he said I do not know what you mean or something of that sort and then he said You will never see me here again —he went away instantly——I did not see him again till he was in custody—I afterwards saw Griffiths on my master s premises Cross-examined Q Are you quite sure you said you should give him in charge A Yes or else that I would send for a policeman—I swear I said either the one or the other—I am a carpenter and work in Little Moorfields—it was a dark bag that Lethborg had—either blue or black—it might be canvas—I will not swear it was not a white canvas bag—it was nearly as big as a sack—it was on his shoulder—I cannot say whether it was quite full—I first communicated this fact to Griffiths on the second Saturday morning—I did not tell my employer I told Charles one of my fellow porters about two months after—I was not in work then—my master sent for me and asked me about this and I told him—there was no suggestion about my being prosecuted—Cock and Hoop-court is a private court—the door of the warehouse opens out into it ROBERT ROBINS re-examined Cock and Hoop-court is not a thoroughfare WILLIAM PERCEVAL I was in the prosecutor s employ when Stedman was there—on a Saturday I accompanied him to Fireball-court to watch—I saw Griffiths and Lethborg come by—Lethborg had a large bag over his left shoulder—I did not see where he came from—I first saw him in Houndsditch between Cock and Hoop-yard and Fireball-court coming in a direction from Cock and Hoop-yard—I went on the second Saturday—I have heard what Stedman has stated as to what took place on that day—it is true—I saw him speak to Lethborg—I afterwards went back with him to the premises Cross-examined Q What was the conversation which took place between Lethborg and him A He said if he did not go away he would give him in charge—I am certain the expression was Give him in charge —I cannot say whether Stedman used the word policeman —I first spoke to the porter Charles about it a week or a fortnight after—I mean to swear I remember the word charge having been used three months ago CAROLINE SMITH I am in the prosecutor s service as a cutter—these two parcels of plush are Messrs Robins s—I know this piece by the mark C P which I put on it—this other piece I know by its being my cutting ANN SKINNER I was forewoman to the prosecutors—these six Venetian plush travelling caps are my master s and were on the premises a long time being so badly made—I could not send them out to a customer—these two dozen velveteen caps I believe to be my master s—one of them is No 132 and some we call noughts—these nine seal caps and velveteen plush caps I believe to be theirs MARGARET GLOVER I am in the prosecutor s employ—these eight braided caps are my work—I braided them myself—they are Messrs Robins s—they are not in a saleable state Cross-examined Q How many of these have you braided A Some dozens MARY ANN GLOVER I am cap-maker to the prosecutors—I made these two black turban caps for them JAMES WALBOURN I am a manufacturer of cap tops and live in William-street Newington-causeway—I believe the greater part of these cap tops produced are my wife s work—I sell to no one but the prosecutors but other persons might make the same mark JOHN GEORGE WADE City police-constable No 623 I accompanied Mr Robins to Lethborg s premises—I brought away the prosecutor s property I have now produced—when the cab came Lethborg asked if we were going to take the property away—I said Yes and him too—when we got to Norton-Folgate he made a kind of a sneer looking round at the property and said he could prove who he bought it of Cross-examined Q Was not his expression that he could bring parties to prove that he purchased the property A That might be his word —Copeland a stay manufacturer James Phillips Bricklayer Miles Head-court and John Brenning a musical instrument maker gave Lethborg a good character LETHBORG GUILTY Aged 23 — Transported for Seven Years

property to belong to different parties MESSRS BODKIN and NEALE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM HARDISTY crape-manufacturer Shepton Mallett I am in the habit of sending crape gauze from time to time from the Bath station by the Great Western Railway to Baylis and Co in Gutter-lane—it is in an unfinished state when I send it and is called crape gauze—Baylis and Co do something which makes it crape—on the 17th of Feb I sent a box by the wagon containing a quantity of crape gauze worth 180l to Baylis and Co —the box was in the habit of travelling backwards and forwards by the railway—this is the invoice of goods sent on the 17th of Feb —it was prepared in my house—these crapes which are here are not in a saleable state and are all of my manufacture—the marks on these crapes correspond with the marks in the invoice—I have looked particularly at one piece of this crape and find a particular mark on it which indicates a certain quality which we call No 4 treble—we supplied that quality and mark to Baylis and Co that day and to no one else—a day or two after I heard that the parcel had not arrived—I never saw nor beard of any of the crapet again till they were before the Magistrate—there are about leven packets and a half here—I lost twentynine packets in all—that quantity of goods would weigh 861bs and the box about 30lbs —some of these crapes have been dyed black since they were transmitted and some are what the dyers call boiled off which does not in the least interfere with my recognition of them as my manufacture—they were sent by Kelly the carman Cross-examined by MR CARTEEN Q Do you know who packed this box A No I should say my ton did—this invoice is in his handwriting—he is not here—I cannot say that I saw the box before it was sent—I passed the whole of the crape from the weavers before it was pat into the box—that box and crape ought to have gone that day JOHN FORED I am in the service of Kelly a waggoner—I received a parcel from Mr Hardisty of Shepton Mallett on Friday evening—here is the bill of it—I took it to the Bath station and had it weighed there—I deposited it with the officer at the station about six o clock on Saturday morning—I knew the box before and had been in the habit of carrying it backwards and forwards Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you tee the box weighed A I do not think I did—Mr Hardisty s man Snoller gave me the box in presence of Mr Kelly NATHANIEL LOADIE I am employed by the Great Western Railway Company at the Bath station—on the 18th of February I received a box consigned to Baylis and Co of London—I was present when it was weighed Cross-examined Q Did you take down from your own knowledge of the weight or from somebody calling it over A From some one calling it over—I do not adjust the weights MR BODKIN Q There was one at the scale and you were taking down the weights A Yes it weighed lewt 1qr 4lb —the goods train would leave Bath for London at half-past ten o clock that night—I was present when truck 170 was packed—this box was packed in it WILLIAM HARDISTY re-examined I found that these goods which ought to have gone on the 17th of February were missing from the warehouse on the 18th and were there on the 17th Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q At the time they were supposed to have been packed what quantity of this sort of crape had you in the factory A I do not know—we never keep more than eight or ten piece—I could tell what were mining from the warehouse from what were left—it is generally my habit to examine it every Saturday night—I can undertake to swear that a fortnight after this stock was not in my warehouse because the stock would not agree with it—I examined the stock the Saturday week after—I will not swear that on the Monday between the two Saturdays this was not in my stock—these are not all the goods I transmitted to town and the same mark would be applicable to all COURT Q Are you able to state that that 86lbt weight of crape was gone and was not in your warehouse on the 18th A Yes I had not more than ten or twelve packets besides these twenty-nine—the turn total I had on the 17th was about forty-four packets—that would be about 8000 yards and on the 17th twenty-nine packets ought to have gone which would be about 2000 yards MR NEALE Q You say these forty-four were not in your warehouse a fortnight afterwards had you taken stock a fortnight after the 17th A Yes on the 17th I passed twenty-nine packets of property of this description out of my warehouse—this accords with what was sent off—I passed it from the weavers but did not pack it—in passing it I saw it as I do now—I took stock and knew that this quantity was gone JOB KERTON I am porter at the Bath station of the railway On the 18th of February last a box came there by Kelly s cart directed to Baylis and Co of London—I weighed it—it was lcwt lqr 41bs —I knew the box before as belonging to Mr Hardisty—I assisted in packing the truck No 170—the box was packed in that truck—it did not contain any goods except those that were to go all the way to London—the train left Bath at half-past ten o clock on the Saturday night—the box was bound round with cord and clasped at the end with sheet iron—I knew it was full by the weight NATHANIEL LOADER re-examined I prepared the way bill for this train—it was examined with it and contains this box NICHOLAS HARRIS I am guard of the Great Western Railway I came up with the train that night—we left Bath at half-past ten o clock and got to London about eight o clock on Sunday morning—I remember the truck No 170 which contained goods for London only—on its arrival in London it was in the same state as when it left Bath—I had no occasion to open it THOMAS BISHOP I am porter in the goods department of the railway In February last I was stationed at the terminus at Paddington—the goods train which left on Saturday night from Bath would arrive on Sunday and would have remained uninterfered with till the Monday morning On the Sunday before that Monday 1 was on duty at the terminus—the prisoner who was in the Company s employ ought to have come on duty that night at twelve o clock and on Monday morning it was his duty to get out the carrier s goods from the truck No 170 and then it was my duty to get out the goods of the Company—I came at six o clock on Monday morning—I found the prisoner there—the carriers goods were unpacked and the carriers wagon was there—I then went to unpack my things—one of them was a box directed to Baylis and Co —I looked for it but could not find it—I asked the prisoner if he had seen my box—he said No —the carrier s wagon was not gone then—before I spoke to the prisoner he had not said anything about any box being missed—it would not be his duty to interfere with that box at all—I did not examine the carrier s wagon THOMAS TAYLOR I was a policeman in charge at the lodge-gate at the terminus through which-the goods are brought in and out—I came on duty about seven o clock on Sunday evening and remained till six on Monday morning—I was there when the carrier s wagon came—during that time nothing was taken out—nothing goes out except with a pass-ticket MARTIN PHARD policeman I came on duty at six o clock in the morning of Sunday the 19th before the train got up from Bath and remained on duty till two on Sunday—no goods went out during that time SAMUEL PAIN carpenter Lambeth-square The prisoner lodged at my house—I remember his getting a situation in the Penitentiary at the end of September—he then proposed to come to some arrangement with me about what he owed me which was 8l and some shillings—I asked him for some money—he said he had not got money but he had-something up stairs in his box to dispose of that he believed were smuggled goods—in consequence of that I went up to his room after he was gone and found his box there which had been there ever since 1 had removed from Southampton-street which was on the 14th of August—he lodged there with me—I first saw the box in March—I opened it and found it contained a quantity of this sort of stuff—I did not know what they were—I spoke to Mills about it and showed him a piece—he took some steps to endeavour to sell it—he said they had better be dyed—some were taken to the dyer s and then my wife and Mr Mills were sent to sell it ELIZABETH PAIN I am the wife of Samuel Pain I and Mr Mills went to offer some of this crape for sale at Mr Hackett s in Westminster-road—he referred us to Grout and Co near the Post-office—when we got there they appointed for us to go on another day—we went and these things were stopped—we gave our address—we were afterwards called before the Magistrate as witnesses JOSEPH MILLS I lodge at Pain s house—he consulted with me about this crape—I did not see it in the box—he took it out and I advised him to have some dyed—it was dyed—my wife went out with his wife and it was stopped JOSEPH COLLARD I am superintendant of the police of the Great Western Railway I remember the loss of this box—it was not heard of till the last fortnight—the prisoner left the service soon after the box was lost—I heard of the stoppage of this crape at Grout s—I went in search of the prisoner and found he was employed at the Penitentiary—about eight o clock in the morning of the 16th of Nov I went there in a cab but did not find him—as I was driving away I saw him about a quarter of a mile off—I drove up and said to him Rowland what are you doing you were absent from the Penitentiary last night you are wanted there —he said I suppose it is you that want me —I said I do you must consider yourself in custody for having stolen a box from the station last Feb —he said I know nothing about it —I took him into the cab—I called at the Penitentiary to let them know that I had him then took him to the Police-court—as we were going he asked if I had got the people in custody with whom he was lodging—I said No I wanted to apprehend the man but he warout of the way —he said Ah if you had got them they would be no use to you they know nothing about it —I had not said anything to him about the lodgings or the people—I cautioned him that whatever he said to me would be used as evidence—he replied I will say no more Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you not say Whatever you say to me I shall give in evidence to which he made no answer A I will not say positively but I believe it was as I tell you now—I do not think I spoke to his employers at the Penitentiary when I called with him I had told them previously—I think I can swear that I did not tell them in his presence that some persons were found selling crape which was contained in a box—I will not swear I did not HENRY GOFFE I am in the employ of Grout and Co I remember Pain and Mills bringing these things—I appointed them to come again—they left the parcel and brought some more on the Monday and were taken—these crapes are in an unfinished state and are not marketable—some of them have been scalded and others dyed black WILLIAM THOMPSON I was warehouseman to John and James Baylis and Co in Gutter-lane in Feb —I had been with them since the 7th of Jan and left in June—they were in the habit of receiving crapes in an unfinished state from Mr Hardisty by the Great Western Railway twice a week—they came in a box which was returned—this invoice arrived by the post on Saturday the 18th—the box it referred to never came to hand—I never remember during the course of business from January to June any instance of any goods not coming according to the invoice or any loss with this exception—Baylis and Co never disposed of any articles in this state—I have looked at all the marks on this invoice with reference to the marks on these goods and they correspond CHARLES MASSEY I am superintendent of the goods department of the Great Western Railway When goods arrive at seven or eight o clock on Sunday they are not to travel on Sunday but are delivered on the Monday morning JAMES FELL I am clerk to the Magistrate I attended the first examination of the prisoner—he made a statement which I took down and read over to him— read — Seven weeks ago last Sunday the crape was sent to me tied up in a parcel it was directed to me at No 3 Lambeth-square The man rang the bell I went and answered it he asked me if there was a man named Rowland lived there I said Yes I am the person what have you got there he said There is a parcel for you I asked where it came from he shut the door and walked away I did not know who the crape belonged to I never saw the man before or since I took the crape up stairs put it into my box and turned the key on it I went to my situation on the Monday morning and have not seen the crape

t18440205-747  747 THOMAS SARGEANT was again indicted for stealing 2 sovereigns 3 half-sovereigns 6 crowns 12 half-crowns 29 shillings 58 sixpences 85 fourpenny-pieces 3 pence and 6 halfpence the monies of Francis Tucker and other his masters MESSRS CLARKSON and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution THOMAS MOSDELL SMITH I am one of the firm of Francis Tucker and others On Wednesday the 10th of Jan in consequence of suspicion I saw all the sperm and wax ends and scrapings that I had in stock weighed about two o clock—Murrell and Tarrant were in attendance on me in so doing—the weight of the whole was 471lbs 8ozs and there appeared by the shop cash-book 13ozs of scrapings bought that afternoon which would make the whole weight 472lbs 5ozs —I used all the precaution in my power to ascertain the exact quantity—next day the 11th about ten ruinates to five o clock I gave directions to Shaw the policeman and I put three sovereigns and 2l worth of shillings all marked into the till—there is a well in the till under where the money is kept loose in which there is a bag with other gold in it—I do not see any entry made in the book by the prisoner on the 10th of Jan —this entry of 13ozs is by Tarrant—on the 11th of Jan about half-past five I found the prisoner had entered in the shop cash-book as having paid 13lbs 8ozs 8 drachms of wax ends 1l 4lbs of sperm 5s 3d and dripping 3s making in the whole 1l 8s 3d —I directly called in the policeman and took him into the counting-house—I called in the prisoner and said Sargeant here is an entry I don t exactly understand when did you buy these things —he hesitated and at length said In the morning at eleven o clock —I said That answer does not satisfy me I have strong doubts as to your integrity will you show me the contents of your pockets —he threw a leathern purse on the desk—I said You have more money about you than this —he then placed his hands in his pocket and put on the desk a quantity of silver I believe all in shillings—I found amongst them eight of the shillings which I had marked on the Wednesday and put them into the till on the Thursday at ten minutes past five during his absence and this conversation took place about a quarter before six o clock—I gave him in charge—I said to him To save me the trouble of weighing the stock again the weight of which I know perfectly well will you tell me where the things are that you say you bought —he replied You seem to know all about it I don t say —the policeman said You need answer no questions but do you choose to account for having the marked money upon you —he replied I don t say —I omitted to state that when I discovered the marked silver amongst his money I could not discover the marked sovereign—I had put three marked sovereigns into the till and only two of them remained—one of them was gone—I then sent for the bag which was placed in the well of the till and in that bag I found the marked sovereign—the prisoner was then taken to the station and I proceeded to weigh the wax ends and other things and allowing for the 13ozs being added to it the real increase was 3ozs allowing for the turn of the scale—it was quite impossible that I that morning at ten minutes to ten o clock and the prisoner was engaged in my presence from about ten minutes to eleven till twenty-five minutes to twelve and in that time he made no purchase of wax ends or scrapings or dripping—he never left the counting-house—I was engaged in an interview with a gentleman in a small place that adjoins the counting-house—while the prisoner was not engaged with me he was with Mr Harrison in the counting-house—I can undertake to say that from ten minutes to eleven till twenty-five minutes to twelve o clock he-was not out of the counting-house Cross-examined by MR WILDE Q What did you weigh A The whole of the wax candle ends and scrapings and dripping on the premises—I weighed the drawers in which they were placed but I gave the net weight—the tare was marked on the drawers and the deduction was made—I looked myself into every drawer to see that there was none but what were weighed—I will not swear as to the number of receptacles the people had but I will swear there were no more than what were weighed—a regular search was made all over the place to see that there was no more—I did not weigh anything down stairs—the drawers are the receptacles in the shop and when they are full they are sent away—there is a cupboard in the shop—I swear that we weighed the whole contents of that—I kept the numeration of the figures—I weighed first at two o clock on Wednesday again at two o clock on Thursday and again in the evening after the prisoner was in custody—Murrell and Tarrant were with me every time I weighed it—if the prisoner had told me the drawer in which what he said was bought was placed I would have weighed that drawer but he refused to tell me where the things were—he had not frequent occasions to go to the till where the money was kept—if the porter or shopman were on the premises it was their duty to make those purchases—the prisoner s duty was in the counting-house not the shop but in the absence of the others it was his duty—we had no scarcity of silver at that time—there was a scarcity but we had 60l or 80l worth—I never knew the prisoner to lend to the till or to borrow of the till—there was plenty in the till MR CLARKSON Q When you went to the till after you gave notice to the policeman did you find the silver you had put there A Yes and on the prisoner I found eight of the marked shillings—there had been no want of silver—I had put entire confidence in the prisoner JOHN MURRELL On the Wednesday at two o clock I attended my master to weigh all the wax ends and scrapings that there were—they were all brought to the scale on that occasion—Tarrant attended and assisted—I weighed again at two o clock on Thursday when all that could be found was again produced—after the prisoner was taken we again weighed them—the weight on all occasions was the same with the difference of three ounces at last—I went to the premises on Thursday morning the 11th of Jan at seven o clock—the prisoner did not sleep on the premises—he came a little afterseven that morning—he was in my sight till eight o clock when he went to breakfast—he returned at nine o clock and from then till a quarter to twelve he was in my sight—during that time he did not make a purchase of anything if he had I must have seen it—I was watching for that purpose Cross-examined Q I suppose you have various duties to perform A I have—I had not occasion to go out from seven to twelve o clock—I breakfast on the premises—I went to breakfast at the time the prisoner did—I returned in half an hour and I was there half an hour before he was back—I went out at a quarter to twelve and returned about half-past twelve—I left the shop after two o clock in the afternoon—I do not know how many boxes were weighed but I called the weights out correctly—we weighed the wax the sperm the dripping and every thing we had on the premises—I cannot recollect the number of receptacles there were for the wax ends and dripping MR CLARKSON Q There are certain receptacles for wax ends and scrapings and sperm A Yes in the shop and there are others for dripping and changes below—we went round and weighed all that was on the premises—we weighed the dripping also—there were not twelve pounds addition to that—I had marked the dripping-tub with a cross and that cross was there the same—it had been arranged that I should not be absent when Tarrant was nor he be absent when I was—we do not know who the collectors are but if we take any wax ends or scrapings in we know where we put them JOHN TARRANT I was on the premises on the Thursday from half-past nine till one o clock when I went up to dinner—the prisoner could not have purchased wax ends or dripping or sperm that morning without my seeing him—I had been desired to watch—he purchased no articles that morning—I returned from dinner at half-past one and then I remained there till five—I might have been absent for two minutes but he could not have bought any thing in that time—I went out once when Murrell was not there—the prisoner was in the counting-house when I went out and he was there when I came back—I balanced the shop cash-book on that Thursday and it balanced supposing these goods had been paid for—here is a deduction of 1l 8s 3d from the shop cash that day by the prisoner Cross-examined Q Have you not said on a former occasion that you were out from time to time A I was not out more than two minutes—I had occasion to go down stairs but I could hear any one come into the shop and it is impossible that in that time he could have bought that quantity—I went up stairs once with a letter but Murrell was in the shop then—I never knew the prisoner borrow money from the till or lend money to it—I have borrowed money of him

whole morning except when receiving a small sum of money from Mr Hall—he made no purchase over the counter—if he had I think I must have observed it FREDERICK SHAW police-sergeant A 29 On the 11th of Jan I went to South Moulton-street by directions from Mr Smith—the shopman and porter went away and during their absence I watched the shop—no person took any thing to sell that day—I saw the prisoner go to the till while no person was in the shop—I crossed the road and looked through the window—he took something from a bag in the till and appeared to be counting it—I thought it was money—he had it in his left hand and was running it over—after that he went into the counting-house—about a quarter of an hour after that Mr Smith took in the shop cash-book and he said to the prisoner Sergeant here is an entry I do not understand —he asked him when these goods had been purchased—the prisoner said This morning at eleven o clock —Mr Smith said Why was not the entry made at the time —he said he had omitted it—Mr Smith said I don t feel satisfied I should like to see what you have in your pocket —he gave him his purse in which was a check and some money—he then put his hand into his pocket and pulled out some silver and amongst it were these eight marked shillings which I now produce—Mr Smith asked in what drawer he had placed what he bought—he said he seemed to know all about it and he did not say William Smart a coal-merchant Matthew Bramer a coal-merchant Edward Smith a cheesemonger Thomas Knight a butcher William Howell a plumber Charles Meredith a painter James Newman a currier

him round—he did not fight me—he talked so fast I cannot remember all he said—I never heard any body say that he had a relative in a dying state—he said so himself before the Alderman—I will not swear he did not say he thought it strange Messrs Sutton had not ascertained the loss instead of taking him prisoner—he spoke about the 5l directly after saying he had a relative in a dying state MR

t18440701-1819  1819 JOHN SHARRATT was indicted for stealing 2000lbs weight of cotton value 25l the property of the East and West India Dock Company his master MESSRS PRENDERGAST and WILDE conducted the Prosecution JOSEPH SUTTON I am in the employ of the East and West India Dock Company The prisoner was a foreman in their employ—in May last I remember some bales of cotton arriving by the Euxine— I saw it unloaded about the 11th of May—the prisoner had the management of making the cotton merchantable—that commenced on the 11th of May and was completed pleted on the 22nd of May—it is done by taking the damaged cotton from the bales—it is laid in heaps and afterwards put into baskets—the prisoner was foreman of the warehouses Nos 5 and 6—the sale of the cotton took place on the 16th of May—I was not present—I have some warrants and other documents which I got from Mr Dixon the superintendent—these warrants for eleven mats are in the prisoner s handwriting all except the signature of the merchant—it was his duty to make out these documents— This warrant was dated 24th May for eleven mats of cotton pickings imported in the Euxine among them Nos 3066 3067 3068 3069 3070 3071 and 3072 —this warrant expresses that delivery may be made to the person entitled to it but anybody presenting it is entitled to the goods—the weight is expressed in the warrant—the mats should contain cotton pickings and sweepings—in the course of business the cotton comes in bales—I never knew good cotton in mats—I did not see these mats weighed—they are always weighed and the weights expressed on the face of the warrant—on the 19th of June I saw some mats in the warehouse which had been found at Blackmore s and Hamilton s and saw them weighed—No 3066 weighed 1 cwt 1qr 19lbs of sound cotton 3067 2cwt 3qr 15lbs sound cotton—we did not weigh the damaged portion that was on the top of those bales and some bales were all sound—3068 weighed 2cwt 2qr 41bs 3069 lcwt 3qr 5lbs 3070 3cwt 0qr 13lbs 3071 1cwt 3qr 5lbs 3072 3cwt that was all sound—the inclusive weights of the mats as originally marked were 1252lbt — the weights when I examined them were 1777lbs all sound which is an excess of 525lbs —he had no authority to alter the contents of the mats as originally packed—I have been in the Company s employment between thirty and forty years—I went to the warehouse in Fenchurch-street with the superintendent of the police on the 19th of June and found the mats I have described—we found seven mats still in the warehouse which ought to have been delivered—those were found on the 29th of May—they were all perfect weights and every thing right—they ought to have been delivered to Blackmore according to the warrant—they bore the original marks—five of them were smeared over with a brush—they contained cotton pickings and tallied perfectly with the description on the face of the warrant Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q These warrants are made out by the prisoner A This is made out by him—it is not particularly his duty to make them out—it is done by whoever is directed to do it—the signature to it is Gregson and Co —that is the writing of Tullock one of the Company s clerks—he refers to the book and sees who is entitled to the goods—after making out the order it is delivered to Gregson and Co or their agent—they are the importers and the real owners—there is a duty of 4d a cut on cotton—on their presenting the order and warrant the goods are delivered—Gregson and Co are the persons making any sale which may have taken place to Black more by their agent—Blackmore is a cotton merchant residing I think somewhere about the Minories—I did not go there myself to find the cotton—I speak of the weight after it was brought to the Fen-church-street warehouse—I should say Blackmore was a respectable merchant to all appearance and in a large way of business—I have known him fifteen or sixteen years—I know nothing of his private affairs—I saw him at one of the examinations at the police-court—his solicitor called the Magistrate s attention to his being present—the counsel for the Company said they could not bring any charge against him and declined calling him as a witness—if cotton was placed into mats for the purpose of delivery I should say it must be done by more than one man—they would not have the warrant in their hands at the time they packed it—the warrant is copied from a book which has the weight—the weight is ascertained by the prisoner himself—I have the book here in his handwriting—the numbers and weights in the warrant correspond with the book—the clean cotton is never packed in mats—the labourers act under direction of the prisoner who is the foreman—they ought to have known this was irregular MR PRENDERGAST Q It is the prisoner s business to make out the warrants and take the weights A It is his business to weigh them and enter the weights in a book and to pack the cotton pickings in packages—it is his duty to see them correctly marked—Mr Blackmore was not asked any question at the police court—he was desired to give any explanation he thought fit but referred them to his solicitor Mr Humphreys—nobody proposed to call him as a witness JAMES DIXON I am at the head of the police in the East and West India Docks—I received information on the 29th of May in consequence of which I went to the warehouse No 6 which had been superintended by the prisoner—I found there among other things Nos 3066 3067 3068 3069 3070 3071 and 3072 bales of pickings—they were weighed and corresponded with the weight fixed against the number in the warrant precisely—the numbers were smeared over with ink which obliterated the original marks of the number and weights—they are in Court now—as they stood the smeared marks wen not placed outside but there were other marks on them which had no connexion with any cargo which was landed in 1844—these marks must have been put upon them and were 40 489 signifying the 489 ship arrived in 1840—those marks were external—on removing the packages I discovered the smeared marks and found they contained cotton pickings of the weight named on the warrants—I went to Mr Blackmore the same day with Mr Williams and Jupp—Blackmore took us to his warehouse and there I found packages marked 8066 8068 3069 and 3071 —they did not tally with the weights in the warrant—when I took them to the warehouse they weighed more in the gross—they altogether varied—the mass was good cotton—Nos 3068 and 3071 were entirely good cotton—in the other two the majority was good with damaged at the top—the inside was good—good cotton is worth about four times the damaged—I afterwards went to a Mr Hamilton s warehouse in Dunster-court and found the other three number—they weighed double the quantity marked on the warrants and the cotton was nearly all good—3070 and 3072 had the greater portion good with bad put in the top—it was so in the bulk wherever there were pickings they were at one end—I had it all removed to the Company s warehouse—I found the bags of pickings with correct weight in the Company s warehouse and the cotton at the two places on the same day Cross-examined Q These articles must have gone away in carts A Yes DANIEL GILL I am in the employ of the Dock Company—in May last I delivered a cotton bale to Helson s town cart by Blackmore s order No 410 an original bale and 3066 3065 3075 mats which were cotton pickings according to the warrant—I found them on No 6 shed—they were re-packed there—they are put there for delivery according to practice JAMES DIXON re-examined I did not observe No 410 in the warehouse—I found it at Blackmore s—it had been unpacked with a little damaged on the top and the greater part inside was sound cotton—410 was a bale the others mats—here is a wanant to deliver it to Blackmore—it is called 4th class damaged but the one found with that number is good cotton with damaged on the top—I did not find any No 410 on the Company s premises JOSEPH SUTTON re-examined This warrant is in the handwriting of George Cooper NICHOLAS NICHOLAS I am a preferable labourer at the Docks and was acting in the warehouse No 6 on Saturday the 25th of May—the prisoner was the foreman there—at the commencement of the day I was ordered to press the bales of cotton—I continued there till about two when he ordered me to the back of the warehouse to assist in filling mats with cotton—I took a portion of it out of the original bales to put into the mats—he saw ne do it and directed me to do it—I put what I took out of the bales into mats suspended to receive it—there was a man to tread it down close into the mats—it was sewed at the top and removed to another part of the floor—I cut one bale of good cotton open by direction of the prisoner—I assisted to take the whole of it out of that bale to put it into the mat—the prisoner did part of it—I could not say whether he remained there the whole time—the cotton is always in fakes in the original bales—he saw the flakes put in—I made no observation to him while it was going on—he told me there was an onto that he should leave the Docks and go to the town warehouse—he remained at the Docks the whole day on the 25th—but I did not see him on Monday the 27th—I gave information of this on the Wednesday morning—I had thought more about it on the Sunday and on Monday still had some doubt there was something wrong—on the Tuesday the goods were delivered and 1 saw one which I thought weighed 3cwt was marked lcwt lqr 271bs that was afterwards found on Hamilton s premises and I gave information the first thing on Wednesday morning before I went into the Docks—I am not quite certain of the number of the mat—I do not remember that I pointed that bale out Cross-examined Q To whom did you give information A Mr Knight the superintendent—I never saw sound cotton packed in mats before—I thought it might be legal that the foreman might have a proper order but the difference in the weight of the package increased my suspicion—the weight was not put on the package while I was there to my knowledge—I never said anything to one Collins about the prisoner CHARLES PARROTT I am in the employ of the East and West India Dock Company About the 25th of May I remember being employed with the prisoner in No 6 shed treading in some mats of cotton—I trod in one by the prisoner s directions—some other mats were being filled—he was giving general directions to fill them—the cotton was taken from a bale which was open when I went to it—he told me to fill from that We into the mats—there were pickings placed on the top of the mats—it was my duty to act under the prisoner s direction—this took place at the back of the shed behind some West India bales—when the mat was packed the prisoner removed it himself—I went by his side steadying it on the truck—at that time there was no mark on it—I bad observed several mats of pickings in the warehouse at this time—I went out of the shed and when I came back I saw the prisoner marking the bale which I had been filling in—I observed one of the other mats was marked 3070 —I saw him erase the marks on the other mats and place on them a G in a diamond—I do not know what the previous mark was—here are the mats I saw—I saw him erase more than one mark CHARLES JUPP I was present in the Docks on the 25th of May at No 6 warehouse acting under the prisoner s order—I saw the other men taking cotton out of the bales and putting it into a mat which was filled in and afterwards run to the right hand side of the warehouse—they were afterwards removed to the left hand side and remained there till the 98th of May the day of delivery—I saw three of those mats afterwards at Hamilton s ware-house—one of them contained all good cotton and two had a little pickings on the top—the cotton had been put into them by the prisoner s order—I helped to do it—I saw one of them at Blackmore s—that contained more than three parts clean cotton and a little pickings put into the mats by the prisoner s orders—the cotton was put into the mat by the prisoner s order I am sure—I observed some mats which had the marks smeared out with ink—they were left in the warehouse—I did not see that done but I saw the prisoner mark some of those packages on the front the marks of which had been smeared out WILLIAM HEATH I am a preferable labourer at the Docks On the 25th of May I received orders from the prisoner to fill mats with cotton—I assisted in filling one and saw three or four filled—I received directions from him respecting No 410 to put pickings into the top of it—it contained sound good cotton JOHN HOSIER I am a carman I received the packages from Gill took them to Mr Blackmore s and delivered them to young Mr Black more who is between twenty and thirty years old I should say JAMES DIXON re-examined Cotton pays a duty of 4d a cwt —I do not know when the merchant pays it—it must be paid before it leaves the Dock—I always understood that all cotton pays the same duty whether pickings or good ROBERT JAMES ROUSE I am clerk to the broker who sold the cargo of the Euxine—lot 42 was a bale of 4th class cotton damaged—Blackmore bought that at the sale—that particular lot was sold as a bale at so much per lb — 44 was bought without reference to the quantity at 3/4 d per lb as pickings—the price good cotton sold for at the sale was 3 5/3 d —people invariably look at the goods at the Docks before they buy Samuel Edwards of Limehouse William Baker James Grant

t18440916-2262  2262 WILLIAM HARTRIDGE and EDWIN HARTRIDGE were again indicted for stealing 1 watch value 5l 10s the goods of William Sarl and others the masters of the said William Hartridge MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM BRYAN I am in the service of Mr Attenborough On the 7th of Sept I saw the prisoner Edwin in my master s shop offering a gold watch in pledge—in consequence of the address he gave on that occasion by direction of my employer I accompanied him on the road to No 15 Dorset-street Clapham—on our arrival within a few yards of that place he pointed out Dorset-street to me and said That is Dorset-street I will not trouble you-to go there I do not wish my friends to know it but if you will step up the Clapham-road to my brother s he will be able to satisfy you —on arriving within twenty yards of South Lambeth-road he said My brother lives near where those boys are playing —on arriving there I found no houses—a little further on a man was waiting for him—he said Well Bill —the prisoner said Well Jack or Tom just step up the road and tell Dick I want him —I asked who he had sent for—he said only his cousin and asked me to wait till the man came back—I said I could not stand that he must go back with roe to Dorset-street—he consented and as we were turning the corner he said he did not live there it was all a lie he never had lived there—we went to Dorset-street—I found he did not live there—I then told him he must consent to go with me back to the shop or I should give him in charge of the first constable I met—when we were rounding the corner by Newington church I asked him who the watches belonged to—he said one belonged to himself and the other to his brother that he had bought them in the City and they cost 7l a-piece—I asked if he could tell me where he had bought them—he said he could not—I took him back to the shop and asked if he would give me any further information—he said he could not—I then took him to the station WILLIAM SARL I am a goldsmith and jeweller in partnership with my father and brothers in the Poultry in the parish of St Mildred the Virgin I know this watch—I saw it safe on my premises on Friday week last about eight o clock in the evening—I left at a quarter-past eight—it was in a glass case on the counter—William was in my service at that time and Edwin had been so—the watch cost me 5l 10s —in consequence of information I received on Monday the 9th of Sept I went to Horsemonger-lane gaol and there saw Edwin Hartridge in custody—on my return to the shop I found William in the counting-house—the inspector asked him if he knew where his brother was—he said he did not know—William went home every Sunday morning and returned at seven in the evening—I gave him in charge—he then bunt out crying—he said he knew his brother Edwin had been keeping very bad company lately that he had allowed him to sleep with him on Friday evening that he awoke at six o clock on Saturday morning and found him behind our counter that he then went and said to him looking at the case I know you have taken some watches from this case he said No I hate not he said I know you have you know Mr Sarl has missed several things lately and we get blamed for it when you take them he then said If you don t give up the watches I shall give you in charge that his brother denied having any that he then as his brother was going out of the door took him by the coat and took a gold watch and a silver watch out of his pocket and kept them in his possession until my coming to town and that after I had unlocked the case he put them back again—I then said How could your brother get at the case —he said O Sir he can do it with a pair of shop scissors —I said What open this case with a pair of scissors show me how —he tried to do it but could not—there was no mark on the case as if scissors had been applied to it—he then went with the policeman—it is a very unusual thing to have a fire in the room next the shop early in the morning in Sept —the shop is dark when the shutters are up—it was the business of the witness Batson to come at seven o clock in the morning—there would not be light enough to see the means of getting at the property as late as seven without the light of the fire or a candle Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q How are you enabled to fix the time of seeing this watch at eight o clock on the Friday evening A We lock up at eight—we had only two watches on that evening in that particular case—I went to that case and am certain I saw it then—it is not merely an impression—Edwin was not present when William made this statement—I did not beforehand tell him it would be better for him to tell all the particulars—I made no promise to him Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Is not William some years younger than Edwin A I cannot say—Edwin is the eldest JULIUS STAUFFER This is one of the watches I sold to Messrs Sarl and delivered on the 3rd of July last FRANCIS BATSON I am in the service of Messrs Sarl It was my duty to go to the shop at seven o clock and help to open it On Saturday morning the 7th of Sept I went to the shop at a quarter before seven—it was not opened—it was shut up—I knocked at the door—William Hartridge opened it to me—he was dressed all but his coat—I used to call him from his bedon going in there was a very fierce fire in the counting-house stove adjoining the shop—that was not usual Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Does any other person live in the house A Yes up stairs—Mr William Henry Manners his wife three children and one servant-maid—the boy is twelve or fourteen years old MR CLARKSON Q Can persons go into the shop from the other part A Not without the door being unlocked—there is a door that leads from the shop up stairs out of the passage that is locked—there is no door kept unlocked—unless that door is unlocked there is no communication between the inmates of the house and the shop WILLIAM BRYAN re-examined When Edwin was delivered intc custody he gave the name of Richard Edwards MR CHARNOCK Q Are you quite sure it was that or might you mistake it A Yes I will swear it was Richard Edwards—I have a clear recollection of it COURT Q What time in the morning of the 7th was it he came to the shop A Between eight and nine o clock COURT to FRANCIS BATSON Q After you went on the morning of the 7th and opened the shop did you remain there A Yes I went away at nine o clock and came back at half-past nine—I stayed there from seven to nine—I did not see Edwin Hartridge there at all—I did not

the property of William Golding the masterof James Sandford 2nd COUNT of Anselmo de Arroyare MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM GOLDING I am a master carman and live in King-street Tower-hill—the prisoner Sandford was in my service—on the 26th of Nov I sent him with a van and horse to Fresh Wharf to remove fifty bottles of quicksilver from there for Mr Anselmo de Arroyare and to take them to the South Western Railway to go to Southampton to be shipped on board the Trident—I sent him out about two o clock in the afternoon and he ought to have been back about seven—I was out that evening but I know that he returned about ten o clock—it was his duty to come to busines the next morning as usual and he came about six in the morning and left at seven but I did not see him—I saw nothing of him after he went to fetch the goods—he had given me no notice of leaving me—he left word with my wife that one of the bottles of quicksilver was short weight and they would not receive it—I went to the police-office on the 27th of Nov about eleven o clock—I saw Saunders and Robinson in custody—I saw these two bottles of quicksilver which had been found—I went with Thorpe the officer to the Southampton Railway on the same day—I found there one bottle that had been rejected as light—this is it—it turned out to be full of lead—I went from the railway station to Southampton—I went on board the Trident—I overhauled the fortynine bottles of quicksilver there and found amongst them another of those dummies—this is it—they are both old quicksilver bottles but filled with lead instead of quicksilver—in consequence of the discovery I had made I looked out for Sandford and some days afterwards I received a message—on Tuesday the 3rd of Dec I went to a public-house in Jewry-street Aldgate—I found Sandford there—he said he had been drawn into the thing by Maynard stopping him at the Woolpack as he was going up the Minories—he said Maynard gave him some beer and gin and asked him what he was going to load and he told him some quicksilver and where he was going to take it to that Maynard said he could make it all right that he had got two dummies that could be substituted for two of the bottles of quicksilver if he would meet him over in the Borough—he said that Maynard and another man met him in the Borough and there they made the exchange arid took the original bottles out and lifted the dummies in—he said the cart that brought the dummies and took the bottles away had the name of Richard Owen upon it JAMES ROBINS I am delivery foreman at Fresh-wharf On Tuesday the 26th of Nov I delivered to Sandford fifty bottles of quicksilver I think about a quarter to four o clock in the afternoon—they were from No 1401 to 1450—I saw him go away with them—the two that were abstracted were Nos 1438 and 1445—I have had quicksilver in charge before—it is always in these bottles which always weigh 3/4 cwt and some odd pounds—the Custom-house mark on the bottles the odd weight of pounds above the 3/4 cwt —the duty is a halfpenny a pound on it and it is that which makes the weight of importance JURY Q Is it tared A No—it is marked on it Tare 161bs —these bottles are never opened except one or two perhaps out of each cargo which are opened by the landing-waiter just to ascertain that it is quicksilver—he pours a small drop into a teacup and puts it back directly—the weight is the criterion WILLIAM BALLARD I am a porter at the South Western Railway On Tuesday the 26th of Nov Sandford came to the railway between seven and eight o clock—he brought fifty bottles which he said contained quicksilver—I took the first that came out—it appeared to be light and I said Carman this is a light one —he said he could not be accountable for it—I declined to take charge of that light one and put it on one side—the other forty-nine he delivered to me were sent down to Southampton Sandford It had not gone six o clock Witness It was between seven and eight o clock when we assisted-in unloading them—that was the first I saw of him JOHN CROUCH I am one of the clerks of the South Western Railway On the 26th of Nov I remember Sandford coming with quicksilver between seven and eight o clock—the porter found one bottle was light—it was weighed the next day and it was 2 qrs and 171bs —I gave the same bottle to Thorpe the officer RICHARD OWEN I am a master caiman carrying on business in Fashion-street Spitalfields On Tuesday the 26th of Nov I was on Brewer s-quay Thames-street which is about 300 yards from Fresh-wharf—the prisoner Priestley who is a cousin of my wife s came to me about twelve minutes to four o clock—he asked me if I wanted that little cart of mine which was on Tower-hill close by Brewer s-quay—the prisoner Robinson was the driver of that cart and he was with it on Tower-hill—I told Priestley I did not particularly want the cart and he said he had a job to move a few things from over the water to Tower-hill—I asked him how long he would be gone—he told me an hour and a quarter or an hour and a half—I asked him what I was Ito get for the job—he told me 7s or 8s —I told him Very well to make haste—he went and came back and said Robinson would not let him have the cart without I came outside and told him so—I accordingly walked up the street after Priestley and Robinson came up me and asked why he could not go with his own cart—I told him he might go if he liked as he was no use to me without the cart but to make haste back—those were the last words I spoke to either of them and he and Priestley went away together with the cart—it must have been seven or eight minutes before four when they went and I expected the cart back about half-past five or a little after but they did not come back at all—I heard late that night that two bottles of quicksilver had been stolen and I went to the station to make inquiries— my cart was sent home —I found Priestley the next night about twelve opposite Bermondsey church and gave him into custody—Robinson must have known that it was his duty not td leave the cart and to come back at the time he mentioned—I saw my horse which had been in the little cart on the Wednesday morning—it was then in a very distressed state and appeared to have been driven very fast above its pace—it was exhausted and so stiff I could hardly get it out of the stablethere was a large piece of flesh out of its hind quarter and it died on the fourth or fifih morning afterwards—it had been in very good condition as far as I know when I allowed Priestley and Robinson to go with it Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Did Priestley appear as if he wanted the cart A He was very anxious to go with it by himself—he did not want Robinson with him—he said he would take the cart himself and then it was that Robinson said Why can t I go with my own cart —the carmen frequently get gratuities when they go with the carts Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Did you not know that Priestley was living near Bermondsey A I did not know where he lived then—I have since been with the policeman to his house GEORGE CLARKE I am a watchman at Brewer s-quay I know Priestley—on the 26th of Nov I met him in Backchurch-lane Whitechapel at the corner of the Weaver s Arms between seven and eight o clock in the evening—he was standing there and I said to him Halloo Joe there you are —he did not speak to me but ran away down a court ANN LUCAS I live at Mr Waypoole s a blacksmith in Pennington-street Ratcliff-highway On the evening of the 26th of Nov a horse and cart came to our door about five minutes before six o clock—there was a carman with it and the prisoner Saunders—I did not know the carman but I should know him again if I saw him—he is not here now—Saunders asked me if my father was at home—I said No —he then asked if my my mother or my brother were at home—I said No —he said he wanted to drill two holes into the back of a stove and would I let him come in—I said Yes —I opened the door and he and the carman came in—I went into the room to get a light and they directly went into the shop in the dark—when I came back to the passage with a light they were gone in—I did not see whether they had got anything with them—Thorpe the officer came up while they were in the shop—he asked me what they were unloading from the cart—I said I did not know what they were doing but Mr Saunders had asked me to let him drill two holes into a stove—Thorpe then went round the cart and I ran into the shop to tell Saunders and the other man that there was a policeman there—they said Never mind —they came out into the passage and Saunders said as he was going out I am going to get a pint of beer —he had only got to the next door but one before Mr Thorpe got him and the carman ran away as far as I saw him—Mr Thorpe brought Saunders back and took him into the back shop—there were two bags found in the shop and these two bottles in them which the officer took away—they had not been there before these people came Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When you said there was a policeman and they said Never mind did you go to the street-door again A Yes and then the policeman went round the cart—Saunders came to the door and said he was going for beer ROBERT THORPE police-constable H 155 On Tuesday evening the 26th of Nov I was in Pennington-street Ratcliffe-highway about five minutes before six o clock—I was near Waypoole s door and saw a cart standing there which I afterwards saw had the name of Richard Owen on it—I saw two men taking something out of the tail of the cart and dragging it into Waypoole s passage—Saunders was one—the other I did not know—I entertained some suspicion and went to the passage—I saw Lucas there with alight—I spoke to her and got her answer—I did not see that she went back towards the shop for I went and looked into the cart to see what it contained—I then saw Saunders come out of the house and turn to the right—he walked first and then began to run—I stopped him and took him into custody—I do not know what became of the other man—I did not see him go—Saunders said Let me go I have done nothing —I said he was dragging something through the passage—he said Let me go —I said I will not —I took him back through the passage into the shop—I saw two bags there—I said What have you got in these two bags —he said I don t know a carman hired me to help to unload them —I sent for another constable and examined the bags—they contained these two bottles of quicksilver marked with the Nos 1438 and 1445 on them—they have been unscrewed and foun to contain quicksilver and the weight of them is 921bs each—I took the cart and the quicksilver to the station—the horse was smoking very much—my brother officer took Saunders—it might be about half-past six when I entered the charge against him and between seven and eight Robinson and made application for the horse and cart and I went with him and came the inspector to Owen s in Fashion-street—I did not say anything to Robinson about it but in the course of the night I received orders from my inspector to take Robinson also into custody—I think there were some words passed between us—I blamed him very much for not keeping with his horse and cart—as I was afterwards taking him along Church-lane Whitechapel to go to Denmark-street station he complained very much of being ruptured and said he was very from it and he hoped I would not lock him up—I told him he would have every accommodation as far as could be allowed in the station but I could not let him go—he said I was very hard—I said no I was not—he said I did not do it but I know all about it and if you will give me a penny-worth of rum pointing to the Prince of Wales public-house I will tell you all about it —I said I should do no such thing and whatever he said to me I should use in evidence against him—he then said nothing Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Did he not about of a double truss that he had on and that he should not be able to take it off at night A Yes—he did not say I will tell you all I know out it —he said I know all about it and I will tell you all about it JOHN DONNEGAN I am a police-inspector About nine o clock at night on the 26th of Nov Robinson came to Denmark-street station—he said have come about the horse and cart that was brought here —Mr Owen s father was in the station and he said to me That is Robinson —I said Robinson did you go out with the horse and cartthis morning had you charge of it —he said Yes I made three jobs of it but I had not charge of it all day —I said When did you leave the horse and cart —he said About half-past three a person came and hired it and said he wanted it for about a 7s job—I accompanied the horse and cart into the Borough and they then said the hired the horse and cart who are they —he said There was a gentleman with the person who hired the horse and cart—I said What did you hear next of the horse and cart —he said I was standing near the cornier of Well-street about eight o clock when the man who hired the horse and cart came to me and said The police have taken the horse and cart away to Denmark-street station —I said What did you do about that —he said I went home —I said Don t you think it would have been better if you had gone to Denmark-street then instead of going all the way to your master s in Fashion-street —he said I did go there I was anxious to let them know what had happened —I said Did the person who had informed you go with you —he said No —I said Have you called anywhere on the way —he said No —I said Not at your own house —he said I just looked in —the horse and cart were at the station and Robinson and Mr Owen s father and Thorpe and I got into it and went to Mr Owen s CORNELIUS FOAY police-constable H 98 On Wednesday the 27th of Nov I was in Bermondsey with Richard Owen searching for Priestley and about twelve o clock at night I saw him in Bermondsey-street—there was a woman who looked at me and she then went and spoke to Priestley—he directly turned round and ran away—I followed and took him—I told him I was an officer and he was charged by Mr Owen with being concerned with others in stealing two bottles of quicksilver—he said he could explain all about it—I took him to the station in St George s-inthe East—he then said a gentleman hired him to take the job and he was to have 10s for it and to give Mr Owen 7s —he said he took the job and then got so drunk that he did not know what had become of him or what he had done afterwards MR HORRY to JOHN DONNEGAN Q You used the words Did the person go with you was not the word Carman A I am not certain—Robinson and I were speaking of the carman—he said the cart was hired of his master for a 7s job and

Statute &c HENRY JOLLY pleaded GUILTY Aged 16 — Confined Twelve Months JOHN NEWLING I am a tailor and live in the Commercial-road—Henry Jolly was in my employ for several months and I discharged him—I got an officer and went to William Jolly s house where all the prisoners live—I saw Phebe who is Henry s mother and Mary Ann Jolly who is his sister—I asked if Henry was at home his mother said he was not—I asked if I could see his new great coat which he had and which was made out of two yards of cloth—his mother said it was in his own box which was locked—his sister went up stairs—I saw her break open his box and there we found the great coat which was made of the two yards of cloth which he stole from me—in his box we found belonging to me three short lengths of black silk velvet—we then examined a box which the mother said was the box of Mary Ann Jolly who was I believe gone at that time to fetch her father William Jolly—in that box which I think was not locked we found a laventine scarf two duplicates and some few buttons—while the daughter was gone to fetch the father we opened a small box in which the father kept his private papers— he stated that it was his —and in that we found two dozen of my bill-heads—a chest was then opened which contained the father s and mother s clothes and in it we found a dress made of Alpaca cloth which I had lost a considerable deal more than ten yards of and also a pair of trowsers made of stuff which I have a piece of here—while we were thus looking William Jolly the father came in and he solemnly declared that no person was allowed to touch his box in which the bill-heads had been found—that box was not locked—we found a small handsaw of mine under the stairs below and a small telescope which was in the looking-glass drawer in the lower room—I do not know who slept in that room—we found a number of small things belonging to me in various parts of the house—I found my property in almost every cupboard and drawer and box that we opened—I think the whole amount of my loss is 50l or 60l —I think William Jolly is a flax-dresser—Mary Ann Jolly I believe makes slop waistcoats or is a dressmaker—she said her brother had made her a present of this laventine dress—this is the dress—there is about four yards of what we call laventine silk in it—I believe she has only worn it about one sabbath—I have examined this and the whole of the things—I believe they are all mine Cross-examined by MR BALDWIN Q What means have you of judging of this silk dress or scarf A I have lost some and I have brought a pattern from mine which exactly matches it—Henry has been with me several months—I have given him two suits of clothes—I think the last was about a month before I discovered this—I know he said that my son Tudor promised him a great coat but I questioned my son about it and he was astonished at it THOMAS COBLEY police-constable K 65 I went to the prisoner s house proceeded up stairs and found a box of Henry Jolly s—the next box to that was one which the daughter said was hers and the mother said so also—in that I found this scarf and some satin for a bonnet in the same box and four duplicates—one of them is for a gown—in a box which the father and mother said was theirs I found this Alpaca dress—in the small box containing writings which was the father s I found these bills—I looked in different cupboards and other places down stairs and found a number of articles whieh I produce—I asked the father how he accounted for these articles being in his house—he said he knew nothing about them—he said he had seen the bill-heads in his box and had spoken to his son about them and he said they were no consequence—I asked Mary Ann Jolly how she accounted for these things being in pawn—she said they were gowns belonging to her that some of them had been given to her—but she did not say by whom and some were purchased—I asked how she accounted for the scarf she said it was given her by her brother who told her he had purchased it cheap—I asked how she accounted for the possession of the silk for the bonnet she said it was part of the silk that the scarf was made of—I asked her mother how she came by the Alpaca dress she said she had purchased it for mourning MR BALDWIN to JOHN NEWLING Q Are there any means by which you can tell that this Alpaca dress was ever your property A I believe it is and I have a piece to match it—there has been a large quantity of it made lately but they are not of like shades—the one I have is of a shade like this dress—I missed ten yards out of my shop off a new piece which had not been in the house above three weeks—it was similar to this and this perfectly matches with the bit I produce as a sample—I bought it of a draper—there is no reason to believe he had not plenty more of it WILLIAM HACKET SHAW police sergeant K 2 I took Henry Jolly into custody—I was present when the prisoner s house was searched and Mary Ann Jolly was taken—I found a number of buttons in a drawer of the dressing-case which Henry Jolly had the key of and two duplicates—one was of a gown which Phœbe Jolly said was her own gown—it was not shown to her—she only said it from the description JAMES CHARLES BENNETT I am a pawnbroker I produce the brown gown and a black Polka dress—I took them both in of Phœbe Jolly JOHN NEWLING re-examined I have lost six yards of black gambroon precisely like this Polka dress Cross-examined Q Is there not much gambroon A Yes—it is about half a crown a yard—I will swear this brown gown was mine—here is a bit I cut off my piece—it is called brown figured Verona—it is from 15d to 18d a yard—it is lined with what we line waistcoats with JOSEPH GREGORY I am assistant to Mr Dexter a pawnbroker I have a remnant of camlet pawned by two females in the name of Ann Jolly—I cannot swear to either of the prisoners as being the females WILLIAM JOLLY— NOT GUILTY MARY ANN JOLLY— GUILTY Aged 18 —Recommended to mercy — Confined Six Months PHOEBE

t18450707-1545  1545 JOHN HARDING Jun was indicted for stealing 1/2 pint of marking-ink value 15s the goods of Samuel Pickard Arnold and another his masters and RICHARD COOKE for feloniously receiving the same well knowing it to have been stolen against the Statute MESSRS BODKIN and ROBINSON conducted the Prosecution SAMUEL PICKARD ARNOLD I am in partnership with my brother John—we live at No 135 Aldersgate-street and are ink-manufacturers Both the prisoners have been in our employ—Harding was so till he was apprehended—Cooke had left us about five years—at the beginning of this year we missed a great deal of property and in consequence of some communication from Deane I applied for a warrant to search Cooke s premises—they were searched about the 12th or 14th of June or it might be the 16th—it was on a Tuesday—there was marking-ink and other property of ours found there—I returned with the officer from Cooke s to our own premises and I sent for Harding down from the warehouse to the counting-House—I said to him I am sorry John to see you in such a situation we have a very serious charge against you it is not an affair of yesterday I believe you have been robbing us some years and in order that I may be correct in the charge laid against you I will read from a paper now before me —this is the paper—I said On the 11th of March you took from our warehouse half a pint of marking-ink and deposited that at Cooke s —I read the whole of the paper—he heard the whole of it—I had read the detail to him—I said Is this true —he said I wish I could undo what I have done I have been made the dupe of a designing man —I said You know a certain person naming him very well you ought to have avoided his company — But I said again is it true you must know if it is true or not —he hesitated a minute looked at the paper and said Well then sir it is nearly all true it may not be quite —I said then How could all this happen —he said I was led into it by a person and when he had got me into it he then told me if I did not bring him what he wanted he would tell my masters of me —I said How did you contrive to take away so much marking-ink —he said I put it into bottles and took it away at different times —he said he hoped I would be merciful to him—I have seen the marking-ink found at Cooke s— looking at it —I have examined the quality of this in this quart bottle and compared it with what we make—it corresponds in all respects with the ink we make which is entirely made from a secret of our own—nobody but my brother and myself make this ink—we do not trust an individual with the secret—I can say that this is a part of that manufactured on our premises—it is never sent out in larger bottles than these small ones—we once sent out half a pint to a person—that must be seven or eight years ago—with that exception it is invariably sent out in these small bottles—Cooke must have known that—he was with us four years Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q How long had Harding been in your service A Fifteen years—his father is now with us and has been for thirty years—we had a good opinion of the prisoner—if any person had told me that a person in our employ went to a person s to pack I should have been displeased—Harding felt a disposition to throw himself on out mercy and to make every reparation in his power—I was very sorry for him Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How long was Cooke in your service A Four years—he left us five years ago and set up for himself—this in this quart bottle is the marking-ink which I experimented on—I looked at the colour and then at the consistency of if and then at the quickness with which it changes colour on the application of heat which is a very great point and distinguishes our ink very much—I have not subjected it to an analysis—I have merely examined it and seen the effect of heat on it—some medical men make ink—there are a great many inkmakers—we think ours has been adulterated but we never found it out—I have not examined the marking-inks of all the makers—I should think there are 500 makers—those I have seen are near the same kind of material as ours—there is nitrate of silver in all of them—it is the basis of all marking-ink—there is no marking-ink exactly like ours—what one man s ingenuity may have discovered another s may MR BODKIN Q Nitrate of silver is the basis of all these inks A Yes—an analysis would be the only mode of testing accurately whether this is ours but I am satisfied by my experiments that it is ours COURT Q What is that in the smaller bottles A I have not subjected them to the same test but from their appearance they are the same JAMES DEANE I entered Cooke s employ on the 20th of August last and I left on the 10th of June—I saw Harding at Cooke s frequently during my service there—Cooke s premises are about 200 yards from Mr Arnold s—I felt it my duty to make a communication to Messrs Arnolds two days after I left Cooke s service—I remember Harding bringing to Cooke s about half a pint of marking-ink on the 11th of March—he gave it to Cooke in the counting-house and Cooke put it down on the desk—I afterwards looked and it was marking-ink—it was not in this bottle but in a smaller bottle about a half-pint—it was not a regular marking-ink bottle—I should say it was a bottle used for other purposes—Cooke sold marking-ink at that time but I never knew him make any—I afterwards saw the bottle containing the marking-ink up stairs and a bottle similar to this one was under it and it was draining into it—I had frequently seen Harding at Cooke s before the 11th of March—I had seen him bring ink-powder and red ink before that and oxide of iron I believe it is called—he came sometimes two or three times a week and sometimes he did not come for a week—he had a latch-key and generally let himself in—there is a gateway near Cooke s to which Cooke used to send me—he told me to wait till I saw the young man Harding and then I was to say to him that Mr Cooke wanted him—I heard Harding say to Cooke on one occasion Don t send them close to our premises for if our old man were to see them or to know it he would have some suspicion or it might excite out old man s suspicion or words to that effect—I am sure I heard him say that—I do not recollect that Cooke made any answer—I am not certain whether that was before or after the marking-ink was brought—while 1 was at Cooke s I never knew any marking-ink to be made or to be bought by him Cross-examined by MR MELLOR Q What were you before you entered Mr Cooke s employ A A painter at King s Stanley in Glucosesteshire—I had no shop—I was working for myself—my father knew the trade before me—I was not apprentice to him—I have been in a person s employ for two months or so—I was not in great distress when Cooke took me—I certainly was glad to have a place—it was near winter—I was married and my wife had constant work—there was no other person in the room to see this ink brought—I do not know of any person being present to see anything that I have spoken to—I was dismissed from Cooke s service—he never told me that I was a good-for-nothing fellow or that I was not to be depended upon and he would not keep me—I did not see him at all times in his business—he was sometimes at work till two or three o clock in the morning and I was with him—he has worked late I know—I do not know that it is a rule in the business with respect to marking-ink to make it privately—I know it is a secret and persons in pos-session of it do not wish to communicate it to others—I have been in the habit of purchasing materials for Cooke in his business—I never knew of his working at night alone—he had a boy in his service—I have been in the habit of cleaning out a pestle and mortar occasionally—I believe corrosive sublimate had been used in it—by the appearance it had only been used for one particular purpose—Cook has come home in a passion sometimes and found fault with me—I never said I would serve him out—I remember paying Paddock 1s which I owed him—I did not on that occasion say to him I have got Cooke now and I will serve him out—I never used those words or any similar expression—I never knew any other packer but Harding—I do not know that packing requires more experience than any other part of the business—I never attempted to pack—I knew nothing of the business before I went to Cooke s—he used to make a great quantity of inks and have them packed and sent abroad—he made black and blue ink—he was in the habit of sending me and others to buy materials—I never recollect his writing out a list of the things he wanted—I went by word of mouth COURT Q Did he ever intimate to you that he was in the habit of making marking-ink A No MR BODKIN Q Did you ever get any materials applicable to making marking-ink A Not to my knowledge—when he worked late at night I was up with him—that was when we made ink which was once in two or three months—he made black ink and I assisted him—there were some new circulars brought home one day from the printer s with a different price of ink on for our traveller to circulate—I opened and looked at them and saw the prices—Mrs Cooke asked me why I did it—I said it was no harm I had seen it before it went and I wanted to see how it was done—she said that was not all there was an invoice opened up stairs—I said I never saw it but that was no more harm than my letters being detained and broken open—she said Who did it —I said That is what I want to know —that was the cause of my dismissal and two days afterwards I went to Mr Arnold s—I did not go before as I was a young man a hundred miles from home and I was distressed—I had but about 15s a week—I had a child—I had a room in the house and found my own board—I had no friends to go to—I saw Harding bring the ink powder before Christmas—I suspected something was wrong in Jan and from that time I took a note in my book of what happened Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q This was a book in cypher was it not and had Feb before Jan and all sorts of messes in it A It is in cypher—this is the book—I knew marking-ink before I saw this—I had seen marking-ink at Cooke s but did not know how it was made GEORGE TREW City police-constable No 26 I took Harding into custody—I found on him a bunch of keys one of which is a latch-key which opens Cooke s door Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q It would fit a great many doors would it not A I cannot say—I only tried it to that door—it is a common key GEORGE WARDLE City police-constable No 325 I searched Cooke s house on Tuesday the 17th of June—I found this bottle of marking-ink in one of the drawers of the chest in the first floor sitting-room also these eight small bottles of marking-ink and a quantity of ink powders which I produce a part of a bottle of red ink and about 7lbs of copperas SAMUEL PICKARD ARNOLD re-examined I have looked at all this property—I believe it to be ours—neither Harding nor any one in our employ had an opportunity of knowing how marking-ink was made—it was entirely private JURY Q Have you any locks on your premises that this key will fit A I know of nothing like it Mr Pappineau a stationer in Mark-lane and Mrs Soper of New-street gave Cooke a good character HARDING— GUILTY Aged 28 —Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutors who engaged to take him back into their service — Confined six Months — See page 453 COOKE— GUILTY Aged 35 — Transported for Seven Years

knowing it to have been stolen MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution THOMAS EVANS I am in the employ of William Cash and another—on the 20th Nov I made a discovery and communicated it to one of the principals in our establishment—George Hanslip was in their employ as an entering clerk—I do not know what his salary was—if the servants require any little article for their own wearing it is not refused—it was usual in that case to ask for the article and have it entered in the regular way in the day-book—they had them at cost price and generally paid for them at the time but it was allowed for them to have them booked to them and not to pay for them at the time to have them on credit JAMES GILL I am assistant to Mr Filmer a pawnbroker in the Old Kent-road—I have two remnants of figured satin pawned by Mrs Wands-worth on the 29th Oct —I think there is about five yards in each of the remnants—I advanced on them 1l 1s —I have fourteen yards and a half of black figured satin pawned by Mrs Wands worth on 31st Oct for 35s —she pawned at the same time two other remnants of satin—it is also waistcoating but it is of inferior quality—on these two I lent 10s MARY ANN WANDSWORTH I am the wife of Edwin Wandsworth—I live at No 10 Alfred-place Old Kent-road—the prisoners have lodged at my house for some months—I pawned this fourteen yards and a half of satin with Mr Gill on the 31st Oct for 35s —Olivia Hanslip gave it me to pawn—I pawned for her on the same day these two remnants of satin waistcoating—these are them—she said she wanted to make a little money up and that her son had purchased them—I gave her the duplicates—she did not tell me what she should do with them nor say anything afterwards about what she bad done with them Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q How long had Olivia Hanslip lodged at your house A Since April—George Hanslip is her son THOMAS HOLYLAND I am warehouseman to Mr William Cash and another—I have looked through their satin stock and found a deficiency of about one hundred yards—this black figured satin is one that was in our stock and these other two remnants are patterns we had in our stock—the value of these remnants is 2s 4d or 2s 6d a yard—the black cost 1s 6d a yard—here is three yards and a half in this blue and six yards and three quarters of this spotted black and fourteen yards and a half of this black figured—this has the manufacturer s mark on it which corresponds with the invoice sent to us Cross-examined Q Have you the invoice here A Yes—here is a mark on this piece of black—we had it of J W Robinson and Co of Milk-street—here is the manufacturer s number in pencil-mark No 81115—this number is not in our book but it is in the invoice—we ascertained from the pattern that we had lost this piece of goods—they are goods we had not been wanting for a month or six weeks—we never looked for this till we found it—I did not take particular notice of what patterns were missing—I had not time to do it—I went by the quantity—I did not miss this particular pattern but having seen it at the pawnbroker s and knowing we had this particular pattern I say this is ours—I think we had only one piece of this pattern—I do not know what was the length of it COURT Q Who took in the goods to ascertain that the quantity corresponded with the invoice A I took them in myself—it is twelve months last summer since these goods came in—I sell nearly the whole of these goods myself—I execute all the orders—if I happen to be out Mr Cash his partner or other young men in the shop may sell—I have not the books here—I do not know the numbers put on the different goods by the manufacturer MR CLARKSON Q Is this the bill of parcels you received with these goods A Yes—the number on this bill is the same as that on this piece of goods 81 115 fourteen yards and a half at 7s 6d —that is the exact compliment there is here—the prisoner had nothing whatever to do with the selling department—he had no authority to purchase anything without applying to his employers or to one of the young men in the establishment—on examining our stock this fourteen yards and a half was not there—I believe it to be my employers property—the selling price is 9s 6d a yard BENJAMIN CHREES I am in the service of Mr Robinson a satin manu-facturer—this is one of our bills of parcels supplied to the prosecutors—the number on this piece of satin and the number on this bill are the same—this it one we supplied to Messrs Cash and Co —the satin dresser pots the number Cross-examined Q What is this piece of paper you have A A memorandum from our books—I have examined the number—this is the only piece of this number that ever was sold—here is the No 81115 GEORGE WARDLE City police-constable No 25 I apprehended George Hanslip on the 26th Nov —I took him to the station—I then went to No 10 Alfred-place Old Kent-road—Olivia Hanslip opened the door—I asked if her name was Hanslip—she said it was and wanted to know my business—I said I had got her son in custody for robbing his employers and I must search her premises—she asked if I had a Magistrate s search warrant—I said I had not but I had her son in custody and Was justified in searching her house—I showed her a card which we always carry when we are in private clothes and she said I might do as I liked—I asked her if she had any duplicates—she said No —I then called Mrs Wandsworth and asked her if she had ever pawned any property for this good lady—she said yes she had—Mrs Hanslip said You never pawned anything for me —Mrs Wandsworth said How can you say so —I said to Mrs Hanslip How can you be such a wicked woman as to tell me falsehoods —she then said she had given Mrs Wandsworth some property to pledge which had been brought by her son and which she expected was bought or brought I will not be certain which from his employers—I found some things there which are not the subject of this indictment—on the following day I was taking the prisoners to Guild-hall—on the way George Hanslip asked me how I thought his mother would get on—I said I could not tell—he said She is innocent of the robbery I persuaded her to burn the duplicates

I am clerk to Benjamin Wortley Home and another Fidler was in their service as a van-driver between the Swan with Two Necks and Paddington—this is the way-bill of the 20th of March—here is in it an entry in my handwriting of a box and three trusses for Dunn of Exeter from Brettle and Co —the box is here—it was weighed and placed in the van—I pointed out to Fidler the things that were to go by the van that day—the box was amongst them—the things that were to go by that van were kept separate as they always are—to the best of my recollection Fidler loaded the van and I believe his boy assisted and also the men that are employed to load the vans—I do not recollect to have seen Meatyard there—I saw the van leave the yard—I gave the way-bill to the boy Terry Cross-examined by MR BALLAKTINE Q Where is the entry in the bill A Here it is 10cwts 5lbs —I made this out on the morning of the 20th of March from the Great Western book which is here—there has been an erasure here—it was a blot over the ten and I erased it—I made out the whole of this page on that day—I entered the goods from the books as the men brought them in—here is the book belonging to Brettle and Co —when I made the entry I did not see anything except the books—I took it for granted that the entry in their books was correct—that is the usual mode of doing business—all the articles entered for the Great Western are laid in a particular spot—on the 20th a great many articles were to go there—they all go by one van—they are placed in a separate place by the men who are employed on the stage—it is my duty to see them weighed—Amswick and another person were the weighers—I was standing by and saw the weight—I cannot swear to this identical box but to the best of my belief it is the same— looking at it MR CLARKSON Q Is it part of your duty to see the things weighed A Yes—amongst the things weighed coming from Brettle s I recollect there was a box of the weight I have entered—I put down the weight of each article separately and then added them together—there was a box I recollect perfectly well JAMBS AMSWICK I am porter to Messrs Chaplin and Horne I assisted Fidler on Friday the 20th of March to load his van—I assisted in loading ths Van and put a good many boxes in it—I remember Brettle s man coming with three trusses and a box—I remember where they were put—I assisted Fidler in loading into the van the three trusses and the box brought by Brettle s porter but the box I cannot swear to because I have so many thousand boxes in a day—I saw Meatyard in the yard—he was not employed there and had no business there that I know of Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Will you swear you swear you were helping to load this van at all on that Friday A Yes—I never had a doubt of it—I saw the things come from Brettle s—I put them in their place—I will swear Brettle s box went by the van because I had their goods altogether—I weighed them together and asked Mr Tomms if my goods were all right—it is my duty to ask after I have done weighing—there were no goods left behind that day—it is my duty to see that there is none GEORGE TERRY I am in the service of Messrs Chaplin and Home—it has been my duty since last Aug to assist Fidler the vanman—I assisted him on Friday the 20th of March by wheeling the things to the van—I helped to truck the things from the place they were put in in the office to the van—the van started about a quarter past three o clock—Meatyard got into the van with Fidler we took him up against the Post-office in St Mirtin s-le-grand—I cannot say that I recollect having seen him more than once before—when the van was loaded Mr Tomms gave me the way-bill—I went with the van from the Swan with two Necks to the Bolt in Tun Fleet-street—Fidler was driving then—I was behind the van—we took in goods from the Bolt in Tun and then went to the George and Blue Boar Holborn and took in goods there—when we left there Fidler said to me George get up and drive the horses —I drove them to the Green Man and Still Oxford-street—when we got there Fidler said George go and get yourself something to drink —he gave me a 1d to get half a pint of beer and told me to go to a public-house round the corner of Regent-street—I went there—I was gone eight or ten minutes and when I returned they had got the things up—when we went away from there the prisoners got up behind and I drove the horses to the Paddington basin—I left both the prisoners together with the van when I went for the beer and I found them together when I came back—Fidler has given me money to get beer before in coming back empty but not on the occasion of going up—we left the Green Man about a quarter-past four—both the prisoners got up behind—I drove up Oxford-street and up the Edgware-road—Fidler then said George draw up at the public-house on the right hand side the corner of Nutford-place —I did so both the prisoners got down and went in the public-house—they came out and then I drove the van on to the Paddington-station—Meatyard got up at the public-house and went inside the van with Fidler—but I never saw Meatyard get down—when I got to the paddington station he was gone—the van did not stop between the putlic-house and the Paddington station—the last I saw of Meatyard was when we started from the public-house—he was then in the van and when I got to the station Fidler was there alone Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Had you known Meatyard before A I cannot say I did—I was in the habit of going backwards and forwards with the van—I do not recollect whether Meatyard had been with the van before—I have sometimes had a glass of beer given me—I have not been in the habit of driving the van from the George and Blue Boar—I never drive when the van is loaded—I have driven when it was empty—I cannot swear whether I have driven it when full MR BALLANTINE to JOSEPH PALMER TOMMS Q On this very Friday was there not a large truss of goods put in the van and taken to Paddington that ought not to have gone there A There was a truss put on the van by mistake—it was returned from Paddington the next day THOMAS LONG I was in the service of Chaplin and Home—on Friday the 20th of March it was my duty to receive the goods at the Great Western Railway at Paddington which came by the van—I remember receiving the way-bill—when I received the goods from the van Fidler was not there—he brought the van there and then took the horses away to the stable and left me to take the things away from the van—I received two boxes and there ought to have been three—I made a mark against the place in the way-bill of the particular box I missed—here it is— reads — Only two received instead of three directed to Dunn of Exeter —one of the Company s servants took them off—the boxes were all three entered together on the way-bill—this pencil mark Only two boxes come to bund is my writing—I wrote it directly I missed the box Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINK Q You do not really know which box did not come to hand A No all I know was there was one missing JOHN ARCHER police-sergeant G 8 In consequence of information I went to Cock-lane on Saturday morning the 21st of March about eleven o clock—I watched the house No 23 from eleven o clock on the Saturday morning till between eight and nine o clock on the Sunday night—I then entered the house with Sergeant Cotton and in the front room on the second floor I found the prisoner Meatyard and his wife and this box—I told Meatyard we were police-officers and asked how he came in possession of this box—he said a man brought it there and left it—I asked if he knew the man he said no he had never seen him before—I took him into custody on suspicion of stealing it—on the 24th of March Fidler was brought to Guildhall by one of Chaplin and Horne s clerks—I told him he must consider himself in custody on suspicion of being concerned with another man who was in custody for stealing that box pointing out the box to him —he said Very well —I found these two glove-boxes in the box Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q You had been watching this house from Saturday to Sunday night A Yes—I did not find Meatyard till Sunday night—it is a beer shop—a great many people were going in and out RICHARD IRELAND I am in the service of Messrs Brettle and Co —these two glove-boxes which are here have my writing on—I know that they have been in the house of my employers CHARLES HUMPHREYS I am one of the porters of Messrs Brettle and Co —I numbered the inside of the lid of the box which was sent to Dunn of Exeter—the number I put on it was 1654—this is my number on the inside of the lid of this box—I assisted in packing the box—this is the box and its contents JOHN FINCHAM I have examined this box and its contents—the value of it is between 40l and 50l —it consists of neckerchiefs stockings gloves and other things MR PAYNE called CHARLES MEATYARD I am the prisoner Meatyard s brother—I am a pork-butcher and carry on business at No 185 Whitecross-street—my brother has been out of employ for some months—I have contributed to his support—I remember the Friday on which this matter is said to have happened—I saw my brother that day—he came to me that Friday morning and my wife said he had better walk to market with me and we could talk about what I was going to do far him—when we got to the Bull and Mouth we saw Fidler on the van—I said Where are you going —he said Home —I and my brother jumped into the van—Fidler drove on to Morrison s—he there took out a few things and we went into a public-house close at hand and had a pot of half-and-half—Fidler told my brother he was going to leave his situation—he said he was keeping a man and a boy at a shop he did not see why he should pay a man and work out himself he might as well be at home—I said Certainly not do you think there is a chance for my brother —he said yes he thought there was—I said he had been out of work some time I thought of doing something for him and said If you could speak for him and get him a situation I will give you 5l —he said he did not require anything of the kind but of course he Would speak for him—I said Perhaps my brother had better go now perhaps an hour too early may be better than a minute too late —he said no he had to give warning—I then came to the door—it appeared he had something to say to my brother and I left—it was then from twelve to one o clock MR BALLANTINB Q You were with your brother for the sake of getting him a situation A O dear no he was going to market with me—he came to my house—I have passed by Cock-lane but I was never in it in my life—my brother is married and I have understood he has lived there a few weeks—I have never been to see him—he has been out of employ a month Or two MR CLARKSON Q He lived on the second floor in Cock-lane A I do not know—I have known him living there a few months—I have seen Fidler and my brother together before that

t18460330-938  938 PATRICK NICHOLLS and JOHN BRAHAM were indicted for stealing 1000 yards of brown Hessian value 20l and 1 canvas wrapper 2s the goods of Elizabeth Hore the mistress of Nicholls MR BALLANTINB conducted the Prosecution PETBR HORE I am the son of Elizabeth Hore who is the proprietor of Hore s Wharf—I help to manage the business for her—I do not recollect a bale of goods arriving at our wharf marked G S S 7 but the books show there was—there is no entry in my writing JAMES HALL I was clerk in the employ of Mrs Hore—on the 2nd of March 1842—the London schooner traded between Dundee and our wharf—I copied the manifest into a book kept at Mrs Hore s called the ships book—there is a bale of goods entered marked G S S 7—I saw that bale—this is the cover of the bale I saw on Mrs Hore s wharf— looking at a wrapper —I saw it when I took stock in July 1843—I left in May 1844—I have the manifest here—I received it before the London discharged when she came up in the river—that is the usual course of business—I know this to be the self-same paper—it came through the post directed to Mrs Hore—I saw it there in the course of my duty Q It was filed and you took it from the file A Yes and there is an entry in it corresponding with the bale—I acted on this paper—the book is here in which I copied it—here is the entry by which it appears that a bale marked G S S 7 came bfy the London—there is a book called the monthly remains-book—it is an account of the stock which remains at the end of the month—the whole cargo of the London was checked off in the landing-book—it was marked off by the foreman who is now dead—the bale is also entered in the stock-book which I copied from the remains—book—I copied it as landed from the Courier but that is an error—this stock-book represents the amount of stock on Mrs Hore s wharf—Nicholls was in her service when I was—he would have access to this book and this would appear to be a proper description of the goods in stock Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q These books are kept on the wharf A Yes in the counting-house—there were three or four clerks in Mrs Hore s employ—Nicholls war delivering foreman—there is a landing foreman and a gate-keeper—I have seen this bale on the wharf—I did not see it landed—that was the department of the man who is dead—this bale was not landed at our wharf—our wharf was burnt down and this bale was landed at Topping s wharf and brought with other goods from there to our wharf—I did not see it brought but I know it was on Hore s wharf by seeing it there in July 1842 when we took stock—we do not mark on every bale the name of the vessel by which it comes—the Dundee bales do not in general bear the name of the vessel that brings them—the goods brought by country vessels sometimes do—there was no mark on this bale of any ship s name that I am aware of—I left it on the wharf—I have no recollection of it only by looking at these books Q You know you would not have put down these marks only by looking at such a bale A I saw the bale marked G S S in the warehouse when I took stock—I am quite satisfied about that—I was six years and ten months at the wharf and left in May 1844—I knew Nicholls while I was there—he always bore a perfectly good character and was a regular man in his habits of business—he had been on the wharf long before I went there and continued after I left—it was my mistake in putting down the Courier in copying this from the remains-book—Nicholls had nothing to do with that mistake—persons who come to have goods away and to make inquiries sometimes see the books and look over them and I look over with them—I do not know Nicholls s handwriting as I have not seen anything of it for the last twenty months—I cannot say whether this order looking at one is his handwriting Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q You will not undertake to say that this is the particular wrapper which you saw round the bale in 1842 A That I cannot say of course—the wharf would be crowded with bales—this manifest is not my handwriting but I remember it coming into my possession and I acted on it as the manifest of the ship London—I never ticked the cargo by this manifest but I ticked it in the manifest-book from the landing-book—there are many hands present at the landing of a vessel—the foreman superintends MR PRENDERGAST Q There is a great deal of business at Hore s wharf A Yes and sometimes there is a rush of carmen SAMUEL STRANGE I am a carman and live at No 14 Paul-square Paul-street Finsbury On the 22nd of last Aug I was hired from the stand in Bishopsgate-street by the prisoner Braham—he asked me if I was a carman—I told him yes—he said I want a bale fetched from Hore s wharf to be taken to Coleman-street —he gave me the order looking at it to go to Hore s wharf and get the bale and likewise a letter which was to be delivered where the bale was to be taken to—the order was partly printed and partly written—he gave me 4l 10s to pay the charges there and he paid me 4s for cartage—this resembles the order that was given to me on that occasion—I believe this is it—I went to Hore s wharf presented it to a clerk in the counting-house and was referred by him to Nicholls—I took the order and gave it into Nicholls s own hands—he was then on the first floor in the wharf—he took the order from me and I asked him to serve me as soon as he could—he said he would—he delivered the bale into my cart and then I had to sign his book—I was then in possession of the bale—I noticed the mark—it was G S S No 7 I am confident—I then left with the bale in my cart—I drove along East Smithfield and passed Hoare s brewhouse—Braham met me near there and received the difference of the money and the wharf receipt of what I had paid—I took the bale to Barber s No 4 Colemsn-street where I was directed to take it—that was on the outside of the letter—I had the same dress on that I have now and a hat Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Are you quit sure you took this order and gave it to a clerk in the counting-house A Yes—he referred to a book then returned me the order and pointed out Nicholls to me—the amount of the charges was 3l 15s 6d —I had 14s 6d to return to Mr Braham—Nicholls took the order from my hand—he gave it me again and then I took it into the counting-house—to the best of my belief this is the order Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Braham called you off the stand and you were paid your regular charge A Yes—I paid the charges in the counting-house THOMAS QUAITES I am clerk to Mrs Hore I received this order from Nicholls on the 22nd of Aug —Strange paid the charges on the bale—I should not have given the bale out without an order of this kind—I referred to the books and the description agreeing with the order I gave the bale out—the charges were 3l 15s 6d including the rent of 2d a bale a week—Nicholls was acquainted with the general charges on matters of this kind—I think Mrs Hore said he had been in her employ thirty-four or thirty-six years—I have been there two years and I know the charges—after the orders are delivered to me I put them on the file—no goods would be given out without my having the order and filing it—if I were not there he would give it to Nicholls or one of the other clerks—I know Nicholls s handwriting and believe this order to be his handwriting Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Do you mean that Nicholls would have anything to do with making out the charges A If none of the clerks were there he would do it—we have three clerks—they do not walk out together—I cannot swear whether it is part of Nicholls s business to make out the charges on bales—I have known him do it but I cannot recollect the date—about six o clock in the morning persons might come for goods and then Nicholls would do it all himself—the clerks do not get there at six o clock in the morning and then Nicholls would make out the charges all alone—there is one clerk there at six but it would not be his business to make out the charges Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Is this the usual form of delivery order A Yes—persons sending delivery orders use this form in general—all the goods we deliver are under orders similar to this—they are not exactly the same—they are not all printed PETER HORE re-examined I had seen this bale on our premises—I casually observed it very shortly before it was delivered—we have ascertained that a bale of goods marked G S S 7 is gone from our premises—the orders on which goods are delivered are filed—Mellises are customers of ours—their orders are kept on the general file—I have examined the file and discovered that one of Mellis s orders is missing—it wad one similar to this Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Have you received any order that you know is gone A No doubt my clerks have—I do not mean to swear that I have seen the order that is gone MR BALLANTINE Q Are you able to swear that an order is missing from the file A Yes—I referred to our landing account—Nicholls had access to the file—the writing of this order is Nicholls s—the character is very similar to his usual handwriting MR PRENDERGAST Q It is not disguised A Some part of it is but the general character is his writing—I would not swear to it only to the best of my belief—I had at first very great doubts on the subject which continued for some time—I have very little doubt now since I have compared it—Nicholls has been longer in our service than I am years of age—he was in my father s service and is now in my mother s—he was in our employ up to the 20th of Feb 1846—we finally apprehended him in consequence of information from the police—the files are accessible to Nicholls but not to every one—the address Mellis 28 Ironmonger-lane is printed—that of course would only apply to Mellis s orders MR PARRY Q This is not an unusual order it is the kind of order you would receive A Yes—I have since understood that a man named Abrahams had something to do with this property—in fact he stated before me that he had PETER M LEAN I am clerk to Mrs Hore I have seen Nicholls write—I have carefully examined this order—I have no doubt it is Nicholls s writing Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q How long have you been there A Eight years—I did not at first suspect Nicholls—the police called my attention to the order about ten days after the bale was gone—the policeman compared the handwriting with the books and he saw a similarity and called my attention to it—I told Mr Hore I had no doubt it was Nicholls s handwriting—Nicholls remained after that on our premises—Mr Hore told me to keep a sharp look-out after him JAMBS FERRIS MELLIS I am one of the firm of J F Mellis and Co —we live now at No 28 Ironmonger-lane We are in the habit of receiving goods from Dundee by the schooners and steamers going to Hore s-wharf—in 1842 we received the invoice of a bale marked G S S 7 but we did not receive the bale—this order is not similar to what we send out—the printing is different—this is printed 28 Ironmonger-lane and we removed there about five months ago—we write on our orders 28 Ironmonger-lane over the old address Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You regularly received all the goods that were intended for you A No we never received this bale—I know that from its being at the wharf and it is not entered in our stock-book—on the invoice it is put Received H R which was the initials of one of our clerks at that time—he is not here—he is in London—the goods consigned to us as far as this document goes were received—I do not remember anything about it only by referring to the stock-book and by the goods not having been sent out—if these goods had been sold they were of a peculiar width and would have been entered Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Were other goods consigned to you by the London A No—the goods were bought but I am quite sure we have not had them—it is put on the invoice Received but we never received the goods—this order is in the same form as ours but the printing is not like ours MR BALLANTINE Q This invoice is marked as received would that account for these things not being inquired about A Yes—I have referred to our stock-book to see if those goods have been received—if they had come they would have been sold or be there now—they are neither in the sale-book nor stock-book COURT Q Did Mr Hore ever send to tell you the goods were there A No JURY to PETER HORE Q Did you ever send to tell Mr Mellis that these goods were on your wharf A No nor is it usual—the bale being under the mark not consigned to any party we do not know the consignee—it was marked G S S 7 and no consignee—we do not know to Whom to send it till there comes a description of the mark MR PRENDERGAST Q You would not know to whom to deliver it A No not till the order came then we should compare the order with the sample-mark and the number on the bale—I know it was a similar mark to Mellis s—many parties have the same mark—we did not know whose mark it was RICHARD WILLIAM PILGRIM I am a compositor ia the empjoy of Mr Stratford a printer Nassau-place Commercial-road I know the prisoner Braham by sight by doing a little business for him—this order is my printing—I printed it at the request of Braham the latter part of last summer—he gave me a document to do it by which was filled in similar to this—he had the document back again when he received his copies—I made twenty-five copies printed the same as the document he gave me—I received instruction from him to follow the copy as nearly as I could—I deviated from his instruction in the size of the type Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Had you seen Braham before that A No never to my recollection—I might have seen him—I have printed for Abrahams but only trifling things—Braham has not come with orders from Abrahams—I am not a master printer I am a compositor—I have been in my master s service three years—I am quite sure these were not printed for Abrahams—Braham ordered them to be printed he came for them himself and paid for them—he said nothing about Abrahams WILLIAM FRANCIS WARREN I am in the service of Barber and Co Coleman-street On the 22nd of Aug we received a bale of goods—I should say Strange is the person who delivered it—he delivered me a note—I placed it in the usual place and never saw it afterwards—I saw the bale opened—it contained common hessian cloth—it was a large bale and was cut open at our door being too large for the door-way—I saw the hessians taken out and made into two packages—I did not attend more to them Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Are Barber and Co in the habit of having goods of the kind consigned to them A Yes for packing—they are cloth-workers packers and pressers—I never know Abrahams—I have been there twelve months—I do not know that Mr Abrahams was in the habit of consigning goods to our house—my attention has not been called to a Mr Abrahams till I heard it here—I read in the paper that a man of that name was tried and transported last Session—I took no interest in it—I do not know that it was a subject of conversation in our house—we pack for anybody we consider to be respectable—this bale came from somebody I do not know—we packed it and kept it—I swear Abrahams did not have it away—I was not paid for it—that forms no part of my business—I saw the goods opened—I received them myself——I do not know from whom they came nor what was paid for them—my duty is to attend to the counting-house and the customers out of doors—I saw this bale come to the door accidentally as I was just going in—I was not there when they were taken away JAMES HOOPER I am foreman to Messrs Barber—I was not in the way on the 22nd of Aug when this bale arrived—I saw it the next morning—it was then undone—I saw there were fifteen pieces of hessian—I saw a letter in the place where letters are kept—I did not read it—I had not expected any such goods—I did not superintend the repacking of them ls two bales— BOC was marked on the wrappers in which they were repacked—they were not new wrapper—the old wrapper was turned—on the Saturday morning I received a written paper—this is it marked A —it was brought by a lad—I cut off a part of one of the pieces of hessian and gave it him—I have not seen the lad since to my knowledge—a carman came for the goods but I did not see him—I saw the goods go out of the Warehouse—I sent Willam Birch to help to put the things in the cart Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q How long have you been in the employ of Barber and Co A Five years—I did not know Abrahams—he was not in the habit of consigning goods to us—we never did packing or anything for him—I have seen him but not at our warehouse—I have seen Mr Barber and him speak together—Mr Barber s partner came in and said Mr Barber there is an old friend of mine locked up —he said he had robbed him of 16l and if he had not had so much against him he should have come against him himself if he had wanted anything to transport him—I never heard it spoken of but one morning and then Warren was not in WILLIAM BIRCH I am servant to Messrs Barber and Co —on the 25th of Aug I helped two bales into a cart—I did not know the carter and I have not seen him since—I saw a note on one of the bales—I do not know what became of it GEORGE WILKINSON I am in the service of Mr Canham a warehouseman and auctioneer in Oxford-street Mile-end—on the 25th of Aug I received two bales of goods by a cart—I afterwards received a letter by post—I delivered out the bales from our place—I have not seen them since Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Did you know Abrahams A Yes—he was transported— See Fourth Session p 593 —these bales were brought by a person named Clark—he said he came from Mr Abrahams—Abrahams was a general broker and commission agent—he used to send goods at different times for sale—he had been in the habit of doing that the last two years to my knowledge—we did not sell these bales by auction—Abrahams paid five shillings for warehousing them—Mr Clark brought them to our place and next morning Abrahams came and I said There are two bales come for you —he said They belong to Mr Clark —I asked if they were for sale—he said Not at present you are not to do anything more with them at present —I never knew Abrahams to have clerks or servants JAMES ODELL I took those two bales to Mr Carter s by the desire of Abrahams ROBERT CARTER I carry on business as a warehouseman at No 16 Minories—I bought some hessians by a sample which was produced to me about one-eighth of a yard—I bought it of Mr Abrahams—that was the first transaction I had with him JAMES HOOPER re-examined The piece I cut off was about three-eighths of a yard EDWARD SMITH I am a warehouseman and live in Queen-street Cheapside—I have known Braham twelve months—I have had dealings with him seen him write and had frequent

same to him —JOHN CLARK JAMES CHRISTOPHER EVANS I am a police-inspector On the 23rd of Aug I was sent for to Hore s wharf to make inquiries about a bale—I went into the counting-house to Nicholls and asked him to describe the man to whom he delivered the bale of goods—he said I did not take particular notice he was a man nearly as tall as myself —I said How was he dressed —he said I don t know he had a large coat on like mine —Nicholls had a large fustian coat on—I asked if he took notice of the cart or if he knew the colour of the horse or the cart—he said no he did not take particular notice of it—I received information and came to Newgate I saw Braham come out and I took him—I said There was a bale of goods taken from Hore s wharf by a forged order you are suspected of having forged that order —he said I don t know what you are talking about I don t know anybody at Hore s wharf —at the station he said This is a malicious thing of Abrahams he abused me when I went to Newgate he has turned round upon me because I told the prosecutor that all the witnesses that came to give him a character were his own relations —I went to Nicholls and Mr Hore gave him into custody—I told him we suspected he wrote the order on which these goods were obtained—he said I know nothing at all about it —I got this wrapper from Mr Carter s ROBERT CARTER re-examined This is the wrapper to the best of my belief that I received with the hessian I gave 4 3/4 d a yard for it and sold it at 5 1/4 JAMES CHRISTOPHER EVANS re-examined Here is on this wrapper B O C and G S S 7 MR PRENDERGAST Q What sort of a coat had Nicholls on A A paragon coat but it was not so short as the one Strange has on—I did not compare the writing of the different clerks—I looked over one book MR PARRY Q What information you received from Abrahams you received after his conviction A Yes COURT Q Are you acting on your own judgment after a conversation with Abrahams A From my own judgment after a conversation with Abrahams

it down to her and then I took it to Evans—the second piece I believe Russell took—I took the third piece—I did not take goods from the shop to Evans without taking them to the kitchen—on every occasion I took them into the kitchen—I took them from the shop when I could get an opportunity—sometimes in the morning—when I took this cloth Russell was getting one of the lodgers breakfast in the kitchen—she told me to take them when I could Q She did not know you were in the shop taking this A Yes she did because before I went up stairs she told me—I brought it down—she took it in her hand looked at it and told me to put it in the back kitchen—I cannot exactly say how much money I have made by this—sometimes when anything was taken I had part of the money—I took the things to Evans told her I came from Russell I took the money Evans gave me to Russell and she gave me what she liked—when I took this piece to Evans I said I brought this from Mrs Russell and she said Very well —I did

Davis do this and Williams stopped at the toll-gate for his ticket or money—Williams was sitting with his face towards the horses while Davis was stooping—he appeared to be boring—Williams back was turned to the brandy—he could not see so well as I could still I dare say he knew what was going on—I saw a boy and I saw both the bags—Davis gave the first bag to the boy—it was a nose-bag such as they give the horses victuals out of COURT Q Were there two bags A Yes—Williams handed the second bag to Davis in the Commercial-road—it was the same sort of bag as the one the boy had—I saw nothing but the nose-bag and a little straw HARRY HAYWARD policeman 401 K On the 29th Sept I saw the prisoner Davis and in consequence of information I stopped him in Brook-street—he was carrying this nose-bag with a string over his shoulder—I asked what he had in it—he said Some stuff for the horses —I asked him to let me feel it and he would not—I took him to the station and found two gallons and a pint and a half of brandy in this bladder in the nose-bag—I then went to the London-docks and waited there till Williams returned there—I took him to the station and found these two spiles on him JOHN SMITH re-examined I should not like to swear to this nose-bag but it is very much like what I had—I believe it to be mine SAMPSON GAPP I am a guager at the London Dock On the 27th Sept I gauged two hogsheads of brandy marked J M 81 and 82 —on the 29th I saw those two hogsheads loaded in Mr Smith s cart Cross-examined Q You put down the quantity in a book A Not in a book on the delivery order—I have not the order here it is lodged in the proper office in the Custom-house— the witness was directed to fetch the order —this is the document—I have made a minute of the quantity the hogsheads contained—I remember putting it down—No 81 contained 58 gallons and 82 57 gallons—part of the writing on this document is mine and it has my name to it—here is Contents 60 that is what the hogs-heads would hold if they were quite full—here is ullage that is the liquid quantity that was in the hogsheads—there was actually 58 gallons in one and 57 in the other WILLIAM PRENDLE I am foreman cooper at the London Docks—I loaded Mr Smith s cart on the 29th of Sept with two hogsheads of brandy marked J M 81 and 82 —they were in very good condition—I superintended the coopering and also loaded them WILLAIM ROBERT STEPHENS I am a wharfinger in the service of the East and West India Dock Company On Wednesday the 29th of September the prisoner Williams brought two hogsheads of brandy to the Docks—they were damp at the bottom as if standing in wet straw or perhaps leaking—I saw them stripped on the following morning and found there was a spile under one of the bilge hoops in each cask— the bilge hoops are the hoops nearest to the bung —those spiles ought not to have been there if the casks had been in proper order—they were gauged in my presence Cross-examined Q How do you know the spiles ought not to have been there A From my own knowledge having seen many thousand casks—a spile could be used for the purpose of drawing off brandy—a cooper would not use a spile in that part of the cask for tasting—a cooper is the only man who ought to draw samples WILLIAM PRENDLE re-examined I superintended the coopering of those casks at the London Docks—there was no spile in them there that I am aware of—the hoops are taken off and examined by a cooper and I look the casks round—these casks were perfectly dry all round—I have heard the testimony of Mr Stephens and where he found the spiles—there was no spile under the bilge hoops when they were with me that I am aware of—it is possible they might have been there but not very likely—when the casks are stripped they are looked all round—a spile might have been there though the casks were perfectly dry JOHN WIGDON I am a guager at the West India Docks—I re-guaged the two casks of brandy marked J M 81 and 82 —I have a memorandum of the contents of them Cross-examined Q Do you speak from a book A No—I had a paper given me to put it upon—I left that paper with the searcher but I took a copy of it at the time—I have that copy with me COURT Q What did they contain A No 81 contained 55 gallons and 6-tenths and No 82 contained 55 gallons—on the following Monday I tried the strength of the brandy in the sample which the policeman brought—it was about two percent under that in the bulk but that is accounted for by their keeping it in the bladder—it would lose that strength—this is a sample from the bulk and this is a sample of what the policeman took—in flavour and quality they are decidedly similar HARRY HAYWARD re-examined I took the sample of brandy to Mr Wingdon—I took it out of the bladder to carry it—this is a sample of what was in the cask JOHN SMITH re-examined Q Are you able to give any opinion from the taste of brandy whether it is the same sort A I think I can give a very good opinion—the exact strength of it must be tested by an instrument—this brandy from cask is a shade paler than the other—this may be a little tinged by the bladder—the taste is exactly similar—I believe them to be the same brandy and finer brandy I believe was never tasted Cross-examined Q There is a difference in the strength that you cannot tell by the taste A No it is not enough to tell by the taste—the lightest is from the casks of course—the brandy in the bladder may be a little tinged by the bladder and the loss of strength is accounted for by its being more exposed—this is the bladder it was in and a nicer thing made for the purpose I never saw—this neck could be used with a gimlet—the bore of the gimlet is rather larger than this—this neck might be put in and turned down so that an officer would not have discovered it—no wet would have escaped from the hole—I have seen a good many straight ones—I never saw one like this COURT Q Are you of opinion from your knowledge that this brandy was of the same bulk originally A I should say it certainly was—it appears to me to be the same liquor WILLIAMS— GUILTY Aged 18 — Confined One Year

the goods of James Marshall and another her masters and BENJAMIN SIMONS feloniously receiving the same well knowing them to be stolen 2nd COUNT for receiving harbouring comforting assisting and maintaining the said Ann Simons well knowing her to have committed the said felony MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL with MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the prosecution JAMES MARSHALL I am in partnership with Mr Stinton as silk-mercers and drapers generally carrying on a large business in Vere-street Oxford-street—the prisoner Ann Simons was in our service for two years and a half and was employed in the cloak-room among other things to cut out goods for the purpose of having them made up—to the time when these discoveries were made I was not aware that she had a father alive—I never had any conversation with her about her father but I always understood from the whole of our establishment that she had no father not from herself On 19th Oct last in consequence of discoveries I made I gave her into custody—we have at various times missed large quantities of silks lace hosiery gloves shawls ribbons and other things—from circumstances that transpired on 22nd Oct I went down to Gumley near Market Harborough in Leicester-shire to the house of the prisoner Benjamin Simons—he keeps the Harborough Arms there—I arrived there about ten or half-past ten o clock at night—I told him that they my name was Marshall and I wished to speak to him privately—he said he did not know the name of Marshall—I said it appeared to me a very extraordinary thing that he did not know the name of Marshall that his daughter had been living with us for three years that she had been in the country for her holiday last Christmas and that I had been told that her holiday was spent at his house—he appeared to be very excited and said it was a hard thing that he should be accountable for what his daughter had been doing in London 100 miles away—I had not then told him what his daughter had done—I told him that he appeared to be a most unnatural parent that he seemed to care so little about it—I then told him that his daughter had been robbing us to a large amount and that I was in search of a hair trunk that his daughter Ellen had brought down there and left in the back bedroom—he declared most positively that he had not seen such a trunk—I told him it was useless to deny it as his daughter Ellen had given me the information and told me where I should find it—I told him at all that had passed between me and Ellen and asked if he had any communication from London—he said he had not—I described the sort of trunk I meant and said without he gave it up I should apply for a search-warrant—he said I might search without one—I then inquired of him and some other persons who were in the house at the time for the address of the Magistrate—I did not get it and went across the road to a cottage and knocked the people up to inquire where the Magistrate lived—I got his address and went to him—I had no constable with me at that time—I went into the back bedroom before I left the house but saw nothing there—I went into two bedroom but did not find the trunk nor anything that I could recognize as mine—there was a stout gentleman there named Buzzard who when I was making inquiries about the trunk called Simons on one side took him by the collar and said Ben Mr Marshall appears to have a very straightforward story if you know any-thing about the truck described or any of Mr Marshall s property or if you know where it is I entreat you as a friend to give him up the property and give him any information you can —he can stated he knew nothing about the hair truck or any of our property—on going to the Magistrate he gave me a search-warrant and sent his servant with me to call the constable up—I then returned with the constable to Simon s house and searched it—that was about half-past twelve at night—he was sitting drinking and smoking the whole of the time—we searched the whole of the house the drawers and all the outhouse—Benjamin Simons kept saying that he had no property of ours and knew nothing about it and was jeering me very much the whole of the time—he said he would go with me to London and help me to search if I would pay the expenses up to London—there was a derision in what he said and in his manner as well—it was said in an offhanded sort of way—we found several things in some chests of drawers in each bed-room which I could identify as having been ours—the greater part of them had been worn and were of great value when new—they were not the things I was in search of—there were several small shawls a silk dress a lace bonnet and various articles of females wearing-apparel some new linen for pillow-cases which I recognized and a piece of new material for a dress—I and the officer brought them down into the kitchen where the prisoner was sitting and I told the constable to take him as my prisoner that I had sufficient to transport him—I was very angry—he seemed very frightened and agitated—the constable at first did not take him he said he would have another pipe of tobacco first and sat down—he was a special constable—I then told the men who had driven me over from Leicester to take the harness of the horse for I was determined to stop there till the morning—Simons then said I suppose you do not want to do anything to me if I give you up the hair trunk —I told him it was the trunk that I wanted—he said he wished to speak to me outside the door alone—I told him that anything he had to say must be in the presence of the constable—we all three went outside into the yard and he refused to say anything—we then returned into the house and he said if I would allow the constable to go with him he would give him up the truck to which I consented—I remained in the house and he and the constable went out together—they returned in about ten minutes with the hair trunk—I saw it in the yard—this now produced is it—I then inquired of Simons if that was all he had got of our property—he said it was—I asked if he had the key of it—he said he had not—I asked if he was certain it had not been opened—he said he was positive it had not been opened since it had been brought down by Ellen—he did not say when that was—he then called me on one side again and asked if I would write to the Magistrate to say that my firm belief was that he knew nothing about the hair trunk that I had found in his house—I said that I felt bound to write to the Magistrate after his kindness to me in giving me the search-warrant at the late hour and to tell him what had transpired—I ordered my chaise the trunk was put in and I took it to Leicester—I there examined it and in consequence of what I saw and did not see in it I set out for Gumley again in less than ten minutes taking the same two men with me—Gumley is fifteen miles from Leicester—I went to the house of the Rev Mr Abthorpe the Magistrate and Simons came to me there—I told him that he had not given me up all my property that I was certain that he had a large quantity more concealed—he said he had another large chest and if he gave it up he supposed the Magistrate would not do anything to him—the Magistrate said he could not hear of anything of the kind and sent for the constable and gave him in charge with the goods contained in the hair truck—we then proceeded to Simon s house and on the road he said it was a very large chest and very heavy and that he would be bound I should be satisfied with the contents if I would let him escape—I told him that I had no power to do so that the constable had him in charge and the property—we then went to his house the Magistrate followed us and told Jesson the constable not to let Simons escape or any of the property be taken away—when we got to the house Simons spoke to the constable and told him where he would find the chest—I did not hear what he said—he called the constable aside—the constable went and got the assistance of another man a horse-dealer I believe and in about ten minutes they returned with a large oak chest—Simons was not with them—his wife gave me the key—I am not positive whether it was in his presence or not—the chest was placed in the parlour and I unlocked it in the presence of Simons and the constable—a piece of silk handkerchief laid on the top which Simons laid hold of and wished me to give him—I said I should do nothing of the sort—he was perfectly sober—it was about eleven o clock in the morning— the oak chest was here produced and opened —the thing were not lying as they are now with newspapers at the top but articles of ours were visible—this is the piece of handkerchiefs that was lying at the top—many of these articles have our private mark upon them—all the things in the chest are included in this indictment—here is a piece of printed jaconet muslin a piece of figured muslin a muslin skirt and an embroidered tassore dress worth three guineas and a half—these dresses are made in this state at our shop—all these articles are new COURT Q Is there an assortment of goods such as would be required to stock a shop or are they taken without regard to any particular assortment A They appear to have been taken without regard to that they are all of the most expensive kind and all new MR CLARKSON Q What is the value of the articles contained in that oak chest altogether A About 400l —we have made a list of them amounting to that but many of them cost us a great deal more than they are put down at in the list—the private marks have been taken from many of them—this silk has no mark on it but it was made expressly for our house—no other house had any of this pattern—this is an embroidered lines dress made very recently—it was in our possession within a few months—it is worth 15s 6d —here is an expensive dress which was in our house last summer and this is another silk of a pattern made expressly for us—when we sell goods we generally take off the private mark—these are cambric handkerchiefs with our private mark on them—they are worth 5s 6d each—this is a piece of Irish linen the private mark is washed off but our name is on it Marshall and Stinton importers —it his been washed throughout—these are silk stockings of 10s a pair with our mark—I have looked through all the articles contained in the oak chest and there are none which I have not reason to believe formed part of our stock—when we had got the oak chest on the top of the fly that I had engaged and the trunk placed inside Simons told me that his son had brought the key down naming some day in April I believe I am not positive of the day but my impression is that he said on the Thursday after his daughter had been taken into custody—that would be the 21st—he referred to the fact of his daughter being taken into custody—he said it was the Thursday after she was taken into custody—he said that she had packed the things in the chest when she was down last Christmas and that he knew no more than I did what were the contents of the chest—he had previously told me that when I saw its contents he would be bound I should be satisfied with them and let him escape—he said it was his chest and it had not been unlocked since she had packed it last Christmas—when he was before the Magistrate he stated that the hair trunk had been put over the hedge while we were searching—I do not recollect that he stated why—that was not said at a time when any deposition was taken or anything written down but when the Magistrate had no clerk or any assistants—I do not recollect his stating anything that had been done either with the trunk or chest in consequence of what his son had told him Cross-examined by MR HUDDLESTON Q How many persons were there in your employment during the day time A We employ between forty and fifty persons at our premises in Vere-street—I should say the greater part of them slept on the premises—we had only two that slept out—neither myself nor Mr Stinton have lived there for the seven years—Mr Snellgrove managed the establishment—Madame Louise managed it only for a very small portion of the time—some person having the management of the establishment was always on the premises—all the goods that have been produced to-day could not have been taken at one time—we kept a sufficient watch to prevent any large parcels being taken away without the permission of the person in charge of the establishment—we have porters who are under the control of the principal shopmen and shopwomen—they received their orders from Mr Snellgrove Mr Stinton or myself or Mr Brown who is in our employ—they take parcels for the young persons I have no doubt after the hours of business—they are not allowed to do so—so large a parcel of goods as that contained in the oak chest could not be removed at one time without coming to my knowledge but the hair trunk might—previous to the last nine months the young persons were allowed to purchase articles in small quantities over the counter—I always understood that Miss Simons had some property beyond her salary Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q What was the exact expression that Benjamin Simons used about this oak chest before you saw it A He said on our way to the Magistrate s house that it was a very large chest and very heavy and he would be bound I should be satisfied with the contents if I would allow him to escape—he did not say it had not been opened at all but that it had not been opened since his daughter had been there—after it was found he said he did not know the contents of it any more than I did—that was as I was about to leave with the chest on the fly—he was perfectly sober in the morning when the oak chest was given up—I should say he was perfectly sober when I first went into the house on the overnight but he was drinking and smoking—he did not appear to me to be tipsy or under the influence of drink at any part of the time—I first went there about ten o clock at night and stopped until half-past three—I got back at about half-past ten o clock in the morning—he was up then—I cannot say whether he had been up all night—I was away from the house six hours COURT Q Do you recollect the words he used in communicating the fact that his daughter had packed the things at Christmas A He said his daughter had packed the oak chest at Christmas and that it had not been opened since that time—there was no reference to his own knowledge of or being present at the packing THOMAS JESSON I live at Gumley I was called up about one o clock in the morning of 23rd Oct to execute the search-warrant—I accompanied Mr Marshall to Simon s house—Mr Marshall told him that he was in search of hair trunk—Simons told me to take candles and light Mr Marshall and whatever property of his we found he was to take—he did not say whether he had the hair trunk or not—I took a light we searched and found some lace and other things which Mr Marshall claimed—I afterwards found the hair trunk—Simons gave it to me in the homestead—he took me there—it was in the open air that he gave it to me—he left me in the home-stead while he went and fetched it—he was not gone more than five minutes—I lost sight of him for that time—he went in the direction of a barn which is near a hedge the hedge is on the right side—he came in a direction from the barn carrying the hair trunk—I saw Mr Marshall again about nine o clock the same morning and went with him from the Magistrate to Simons s house and there received possession of the oak chest now produced—I found it in Miss Simon s barn upon some straw—Simons told me where to fetch it from—I cannot say how far the barn is from the house—it did not take me more than two minutes to go and fetch it—the barn belongs to the Misses Simons two sisters of his—they do not live with him but at another house on the other side of the road—the barn is attached to the sisters house—the chest was against the wall upon some straw five or six feet from the ground—there was some loose straw about it but I could see the chest and the man that was with me saw it and helped me carry it—the straw was packed—the chief part of it was in battens—the chest was in about the middle of the straw—we had to get up on the straw to get hold of it—it was about six feet within the outside of the straw—that was the same barn from which I had seen him bring the hair trunk—when I went to look for the oak chest the straw appeared to have been disturbed—there was some loose straw about—I have known Simons as a neighbour Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You are not a constable A No my brother is the constable but he was not at home and I was sworn in to execute the search-warrant—I did not take Simons into custody—the Magistrate told me afterwards not to let him go—that was no the second occasion—it was before that that I had declined to take him into custody—I have known him ever since I can recollect—he has always borne a most excellent character in our neighbourhood—I never heard anything but the atmost honesty of him—he has lived within a mile of there all his life—he formerly had a farm there and now keeps a licensed public-house—he has eight or nine children MR BODKIN Q How many of them are at homewith him A Two boys and a girl MR HUDDLESTON here called upon the prosecutors to elect upon which act of larceny they would proceed it being clear that all the property could not have been taken at one time MR BODKIN replied that if called upon to elect at all it could not be until the close of the case The COURT was of opinion that although the articles ultimately found in the hair trunk might have been separately taken by the servant yet that by their remaining on the premises they reverted onto the possession of the master and that the removal of the trunk afterwards was one act of larceny of all its contents DAVID EVANS I am a porter in the employment of Messrs Marshall and Stinton I carried the hair trunk produced from my master s premises to Madame Devy s 73 Lower Grosvenor-street by Miss Simons s order—it is more than four months ago I think—I delivered it to the hall-porter there and saw him give it to Ellen Simons the prisoner s sister who lived there—when Miss Simons gave me the trunk she told me to take it down and be sure to see her sister and give her the trunk and I did so—I corded the trunk at Mr Marshall s—Miss Simons told me to do so ELLEN SIMONS I am the daughter of the male prisoner and the sister of the female In July last I was living at Madame Devy s in Grosvenor-street—in the middle of July last I received this hair trunk from Evans—in consequence of a communication that he made to me from my sister I took the trunk to my father s house at Gumley—I did not receive the key with it—I cannot say whether my father was at home when I arrived—I did not see him directly I got into the house—I saw him during the time I was there—the trunk was deposited at his house—I could not say which room I left it in because it was removed into two rooms during the time I was at home—when I first went it was taken into my bed-room—I staid at home a month—I do not think it was in my bed-room when I came away—I took off the cord myself at my own instigation I do not know why I did not want it—the box was locked—I did not open it—I saw the oak-chest there—it was standing in the bed-room in which I slept part of the time—my mother was not well and I slept with her during that time—the chest was in her room—my father and mother generally slept together—about three months ago after my return from Gumley my sister Ann handed me a key at Mr Hickman s—I believe it was the k✗ of the oak-chest—I was to keep it—she gave it me to take care of—she gave me not reason why—I had seen the oak-chest at my father s and I knew that my sister had possession of it—it was in my father s bed-room—when she gave me the key she said You will take this key and take care of it for me —I knew what key it was—she gave me no reason why I was to take care of it—she said it was the key of her box at home—she did not tall me what was in the box—I kept the key for about two months until I knew my sister was in custody—that was on Tuesday evening the 19th—I sent for my brother Nicholas I think on the Thursday evening about seven of eight and delivered the key to him—no one had told me to do so—I told him to take it to my father s and also to tell him how ill my sister Elizabeth was that I did not suppose she would live the night through—I also told him to say my sister was in custody—I did not say what for—to the best of my recollection this is the key looking at it Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You knew that the oak-chest was in your sister s possession A I did I had never seen her open it—she told me it was in her possession and she had the key of it—I went into the country in July and stayed till Aug —my father has been a farmer for a considerable time—he is not a man that troubles himself at all about domestic matters—he is a great deal more versed in out-door affairs than matters in the house—he does not occupy any land at present—he does not at all interfare about the state of the drawers or anything of that kind—he does not even take his own things out of the drawers COURT Q Had any of the family been down to your father s from Christmas till you went A No my sister Ann was down there last Christmas and staid till a fortnight or ten days after Christmas—I went with her—the oak-chest was standing in my father s room then—I did not see that key in her possession at that time—the chest was locked—I tried it—I do not know why—I merely just lifted the lid to see whether it was quite fast—perhaps it was curiosity led me to do it—I knew that my sister kept things in it these—it was in July that I tried the lid not at Christmas—I have seen my sister in the room where the chest was—I had not seen it open at any time NICHOLAS SIMONS I am a son of the male prisoner On the morning of 23rd Oct last I received a key from my sister Ellen—I did not know who there my sister Ann was in custody then or not—Ellen told me to take the key down home and give it to my father—I went down that same day found my father at home gave him the key and said This is the key of one of Ann s boxes —I did not tell him what had happened to my sister—I did not know that she was in custody at that time—I knew that she was charged with robbing Mr Marshall but I did not know that she was in custody—I told my father that Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You mentioned to him what she was charged with Q Yes I had heard that from my sister when she gave me the key—that was all that passed COURT Q did he say anything when you told him that A Nothing JOHN TADMAN police-inspector C I received the male prisoner into custody at Market-Harborough and brought him away from there in a fly—I was not in my uniform—after I had placed him in the fly I told him that I was an inspector of police from London and that I had come down to take him for having received a quantity of silk and other articles which his daughter had been charged with stealing from her employers in town—he said Yes I am aware of the charge against me but I am as innocent as You are of it —shortly afterwards he said It is a bed job for me that I should get into such a scrape from my children stealing from their employers in town —I said Perhaps it is the worst part of the charge against you is that you removed or caused to be removed property after your daughter was in custody in town —he said That certainly is but that was done through a communication I had from town stating that my daughter was in trouble and if the boxes were removed for a few days all would be settled —I then took a bundle from under the seat and said I have been to Gumley to—day and I have received this from your wife she states that your daughter brought them down —he said I have no doubt that is true but I am as innocent as you of it —that bundle contained the skirt of a dress and other things which the prosecutor identified and which were found loose in various parts of the house—I have a list of the articles Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Did he not also say I don t think my poor wife knows anything more about it than I do A Yes JOHN STINTON I am in partnership more with Mr Marshall in this establishment in Vere-street—there are servants of ours sleeping in the house—it is in the parish of St Marylebone COURT Q Are there articles in that oak-chest the value of which separetely exceeds 5l A Yes—I have not gone through them all—there ate some valued at nine guineas and fifteen guineas JAMES MARSHALL re-examined The value of the piece of handkerchiefs which the male prisoner asked me to give him is a guineas and a half MR SNELLGROVE I am principal assistant to Messrs Marshall and stinton and have been so for the last seven years MR PRENDERGAST submitted that there was no evidence to go to the on the count charging the male prisoner as are accessory it being accessory in order to support that charge that some act should be done personally to aid the principal felon see The Queen v Chapple 9 Cur and Payne p 355 MR CLARKSON with MR BODKIN argued that any act done with the stolen property tending to

the box fell the top remained in her hand—I saw her other son in bed—before I broke open the cupboard I tried some keys that would not fit it—she said she dare say some of her keys would open it—she was in very great agitation—I asked for something to break it open and she fetched a chisel to do it—she seemed surprised when these things were found—I found this merino in her box not in her daughter s—I opened a box belonging to her daughter DANIEL GEORGE REES I have examined these goods—I identify a great portion by marks on them—the gloves all have our mark—I identify them with very few exceptions—the value of the whole of my property that has been found is 130l or 140l —the value of the property produced is about 110l —the goods found in Rebecca s bed-room are worth about 40l HENRY GOLDER I am in the service of a pawnbroker at Stone s-end Borough I produce a piece of cloth pawned on 19th July in the name of John Harris—this is the duplicate I gave MR BALLANTINE called JAMES HASTINGS the prisoner I am twenty-six years old—I am the son of Rebecca Hastings I was in Mr Rees employ four years and a half—before that I was in the employ of Mr Wright of Aldgate and Mr Williams of Blackfriars-road and Mr Willis of Walworth-road—I went home to my mother on Saturday nights—a Miss Holmes came to pay a visit to my mother last Jan and Feb —she occupied my bed-room and some things were moved out of it—I was not present—there were things in my drawers previous to her coming—I saw the drawers afterwards and some things which I had ordered my mother to move were moved to her bedroom—I had a cupboard in my bed-room—my mother did not know anything about the articles in it—the box produced was my brother s—he gave it me three weeks or a month ago—the things in it belonged to me—my mother knew nothing of them—these forty yards of cotton are the fag-ends of prints—they are of so use—we were allowed to have them—I do not consider I stole them—I gave them to my mother—these two cotton prints I took from my employer—my mother bought them of me—they are worth about 3s each—she paid not 6s for the two—the nominal price of them would be 4s each—I took this piece of merino from my master s stock—it cost him 14s or 15s —I gave it to my sister for a present—I did not tell her how I came by it—I have give or sold my mother table-cloths table-covers a pair of bell-ropes and severed other things—I sold her a pair of boots and two pairs of shoes I do not recollect anything else—I had keys to my drawers and cupboard and kept them sometimes in the drawers and sometimes in my pocket—I suppose the keys found at my mother s were mine—on the Sunday night before there things were found I left my keys with my mother to place those things back again which I ordered her to take out of my room Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q When were you taken A On Friday 10th March—Miss Holmes left two Fridays before that—there were two scarfs of mine between the sacking and the mattress to keep then smooth—I have been stealing for two years nearly I cannot say with certainty these articles form the bulk of what I stole—I took them at different times—I brought them away in my hand on Saturday nights—I believe my sister was present when my mother paid me the 6s —I brought these boots and shoes from my master s—these ladies gloves were not my mother s but mine—I told her to move them from my drawers with other things LAVINIA HASTINGS I am the daughter of Rebecca Hasting and sister of James Hastings My brother made me a present of this merino—the box of gloves was removed when his clothes and other things were removed from his drawers to my mother s room to make room for a young person stopping at our house who occupied his room—I manage the household affairs—my mother has kept a lodging-house since she has been a widow—my father was a clerk in the Bank of England—my mother has a pension from the Bank—she fetched my brother s from the glass drawer in her room—this box belonged to my brother Henry—he gave it to James a month or five weeks ago—my mother bought these dresses of my brother—I never saw her with any part of the things found in the box and drawer and cupboard—I did not know of the property in the cupboard and box in my brother s room—on the night the officer searched the box of gloves was on the chest of drawers between the windows in my mother s room—I was standing opposite it—my mother went to draw the curtains that neighbours should not see—the curtain touched the box and it fell—my mother stooped to pick it up and by that time the officer had got round—my brother gave my mother this piece of plaid cloth last summer Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q When did you see these goods first A When the officer came—some of them I had seen before—the box of gloves had been on the drawers in my mother s room some weeks—I never saw it opened—I never wore any of these gloves nor did my mother—I think Miss Holmes left about ten days before 10th March—my brother need to come home on Saturdays—I had these fagends for patchwork—I never saw him when he first came in on Saturdays—I never saw him bring home any cloth merino velvet or gloves—I have seen him bring boots and shoes which my mother bought of him—I believe this is the only dress my brother gave me—I saw two yards of plaid cloth which he brought home and some carpeting which was between the sacking and the mattress—I have seen counterpanes there patchwork quilts tablecovers and muslin but no scarfs—I do not look under the mattress unless I wanted anything that was kept under the bed—he had only one chest of drawers and a cupboard in his room—I do not know where he kept the things before were three chests of drawers in my mother s room only two drawers were used HENRY HASTINGS I am the brother of James Hastings I have been at sea two years and five weeks—I came home in Oct —I brought this box from China and gave it to my brother about five weeks ago—it was then empty—I was at Havanna in July Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Do you know Mr Reynolds a pawnbroker at Stone s-end A I know the shop having been an apprentice in the Kent-road close by it but never was in it—I was in business for myself—I then went to sea—I never went by the name of John Harris—I live in the house with my mother—I never saw anything belonging to my brother there—I slept in the back parlour—I slept in my brother s room the night I came home—I never saw him bring anything home—he went to business on Sunday nights or Monday mornings—I never saw him put things into this box—there were boxes on the landing WILLIAM POCOCK re-examined There were two or three more large bundles in the house—there were a great many things in the large chest of drawers in James Hastings room but I think with the box they would contain all the things I got from the mother s room in addition MR PARRY here withdrew from the Prosecution REBECCA HASTINGS— NOT GUILTY

employ of Mr Marlin of Ebley near stroud Gloucestershire a cloth manufacture on 21st April I packed up 24 yards of superfine black cloth—it was rolled round quite tight nearly as this other piece is— producing one —it was in canvass and the number 115336 was on the cloth inside—this small piece of cloth which the officer has is part of it and has the number on it—this piece of canvass was the covering in which it was enclosed—it has direction on it—it was worth about 22l —it was going to Havant—I delivered the parcel to George Kane between twelve and one o clock the same day Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Whose writing is this direction A Mr Wheeler our book-keeper s GEORGE KANE I am in the service of Holmes and Co carriers of Stroud On 21st April I received a truss of cloth from Mr Perry directed to Mr John Bulkbeck woollen draper Havant —I weighed it it was 1 qr 6 lbs—I delivered it at the Stroud water station of the Great Western Railway—this the direction that was on it Cross-examined Q Had you any other trusses A I had nine that day all from the same manufacturer—I observed the directions on them all—they were all coming to London—There were no others directed to Mr Bulbeck—they remained in my possession about half an hour—no one else had anything to do with them—they did not pass out of my hands till I got to the station and gave them to the porter about a quarter before one o clock—he is not here—they were to come by the half-past two o clock train JOHN CHAPMAN I am in the employ of Henry harms of the Angel I am yard Farringdon-street Goods are brought there from the Great Western terminus—on 24th April a waggon came from the Great Western Railway—I assisted to unload the goods—amongst other things I took out a truss like this directed to Mr Bulbeck of Havant—we have a great many trusses of cloth—it was right and hard and had the direction on it—it remained about half an hour—I took it in a cart to the New Inn Old Bailey and delivered it to Mr Rolf who keeps the booking-office there—this covering has the same direction on it Cross-examined Q Did you receive many parcels by that waggon A About a dozen or fourteen trusses most of them cloth I believe—they were folded in the same way but some were larger EDWARD ROLF I keep the booking-office New Inn Old Bailey On 24th April I received a truss from Chapman directed to Mr Bulbeck Havant—I am in the habit of handling trusses of cloth—I can tell the feel of cloth—I noticed that truss particularly—I supposed it to be cloth it was tight and firm—I delivered it to the prisoner in the same state as I received it Cross-examined Q Did you receive a large number of parcels A Only two on that day and the other was twice as large as this—there were two or three ends of cloth in it—I saw this parcel at the police-court after it had undergone the alteration and should have detected it in a moment JOHN BALDOCK the younger I am nearly twelve years old—I live with my father in Bird-cage-alley in the Borough I have been employed four years at the booking-office at the Catherine Wheel Inn—my father works there—I was out with the cart that the prisoner had the care of on 24th April—at Mr Rolf s the New Inn in the Old Bailey a parcel was put in the cart like this truss—it was tight like this—I put it into an empty crate in the cart—there was nothing else in the cart but a box or a hamper—we were to take this parcel to the Catherine Wheel inn in the Borough—We went up the Old Bailey and up Holborn-bill to Liquorpond-street—that is not the way to the Catherine Wheel—the prisoner did not say why he went out of the way—we went to a public-house in Liquorpond-street and had a pint of beer and a biscuit—the prisoner paid for it—we were there about five minutes—he came out first and I after him—I stopped a short time and when I got to the cart the prisoner and the truss were gone—I was frightened—I got into the cart and staid till the prisoner came—in about half an hour he brought the truss on his shoulder and put it in the cart—as we went along the prisoner told me not to say anything or else I should catch it—when we got to the Catherine Wheel I helped to take it out—it was then soft and flat—I felt at once that it was different to what it had been before—my master asked me if we came straight from the old bailey—I said yes Cross-examined Q Who put the truss in A The prisoner gave it me in the Old Bailey and I put it into the crate—I saw Mr Rolf—it was about two o clock I should think—we were in Liquorpond-street about forty minutes—we got home about three—I saw my master between four and five—I took out the parcel when we arrived at my master s and gave it to the prisoner—my father was in the office—I told my master next day about our going to the public-house and took the policeman there JOHN BALDOCK I am in Mr Polden s service On 24th April I saw the prisoner bring a truss in—I did not feel it—I saw standing upright by the door—in about half an hour I weighed it—I saw the pencil-mark of the weight—it did not weigh what it was marked—it was soft—I asked my master to weigh it—it was 9lbs lighter than it should have been—from the time I first saw it there was no opportunity for any one to alter it or touch it—it was not out of my sight five minutes Cross-examined Q How long did it remain in the office A I suppose nearly two hours—I was passing and repassing—I cannot tell how many parcels I received that day—this was the only one of this sort—it is my duty and interest to watch every parcel there—there were two other men there—I saw this truss go out to the railway—twenty other parcels may have gone with it—the cart came a little after three o clock—I have been in Mr Polden s employ twelve years—before that I was portering—I have been employed in the docks JAMES POLDEN I keep the booking-office in Catherine Wheel Inn yard The prisoner was in my employ—on 24th April I saw a truss in the ware-house directed to Mr Bulbeck of havant—this is the direction—I handled it—it was soft—it attracted my attention—I weighed it it weighed 23lbs —the mark outside was 1 qr 4lbs —it was 9lbs short—it was not like this truss—if it had been such a one as this if had been altered—I was present in the evening when it was sent to New Cross station—I have not the least doubt that this soft one is it GEORGE FORSEY I am porter to the London and brighton Railway This truss was brought by Mr Polden s van on 24th April—I took it in—I bent it double it was very soft—I carried it to the receiving clerk—it was different from a roll of cloth—it was forwarded that day to Mrs Buldeck s at Havant—it came back again on the following Monday—I saw it—it appeared the same as I had seen it before—if I had carried this other truss in the morning and afterwards had this one given me for the same I should have known the difference CHARLES FLUTTER I am in the service of Mr John Bulbeck of Havant I received this parcel—it arrived there on Tuesday morning—I told the porter to put it down—I did not touch it then—on Thursday morning I cut away the cords took the canvass off and found a brown paper and inside that this piece of black cloth about three quarters of a yards wrapped round—it has the number on it—the paper has the same number and I have the invoice which has the same number—inside the cloth was a piece of oil-cloth and in that a dirty sack with an offensive smell from it—it contained cabbage leaves Cross-examined Q Where was the parcel till it was opened A In the shop in the presence of my master his two sons and myself—some one is always there JAMES DYE I keep the Griffin Liquorpond-street There is a court runs between my house and the brewery—I do not remember seeing the prisoner at my house—I saw the boy Baldock there but I do not know when—a man came to my house last Thursday week and asked me about having seen the boy—I said it might be about three weeks ago or more—I suppose it was about two o clock in the day when I saw the boy—I was backwards and forwards to the tap-room carrying dinners to the persons there—the boy was eating a biscuit—I did not notice who paid for it or whether anybody was with him Cross-examined Q When did you see him again A last Friday week—the man who came was a policeman in private clothes—if it were on Easter Monday when the boy came it would not be a busy time it would be rather slack—my wife serves in the bar GEORGE HYDE City policeman 516 I took prisoner on 1st may at the Catherine Wheel I told him what the charge was—he said he knew nothing about it he delivered the package in the yard the same as he had received it at the Old Bailey—Mr Polden asked if he came direct from the Old Bailey to his yard—he said yes he had no other place to go to—I said You were seen up Holborn —he said it was not on that day—I took him to the station Cross-examined Q Are you the person who went with the boy to Liquorpond-street A Yes I do not know on what day MR CLARKSON Q Had the boy described where the public-house was A Yes and mr Dye recognized him Richard Fryer and Edward Kaye gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 29 — Transported for Ten

dwelling-house MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution ELIZABETH THEODORE I am wife of John Theodore of the Stag Fulham-road in the parish of St Luke Chelsea—the prisoner lived with me a month—on 25th April I received information from Stevens my bar-maid and went into my bed-room on the second floor about twenty-five minutes to three o clock and from a box on the table I missed a gold watch and chain seal and keys two diamond rings a brooch two gold hair pins a mourning ring and a gold keeper and from the barmaid s room adjoining a gold watch and from the room below a gold pin and silver pencil-case—my box was unlicked—I had seen the things safe about five minutes to two o clock—the value of them is about 50l —I sent for a policeman and searched the house but found nothing—the kitchen window looks into a yard which leads into a skittle-ground adjoining the tap-room—about half-past one that day I was in the back kitchen and saw the prisoner getting in through the window—she must have come from the yard—that gave her an opportunity of speaking to any one in the skittle-ground—I asked what she had been doing out there—she made no reply—she was servant of all work and had no right in the yard or skittle-ground—it was after that I saw my property safe—the prisoner had no right in the bed-rooms in the middle of the day as her work was done—I kept a purse in the drawer—persons who usually came into the bed-room would know that WILLIAM CUMMING police inspector I was sent for to Mr Theodore s about four o clock on 25th April—I satisfied myself that the robbery must have been done by some one well acquainted with the house and in the house at the time—the place where the money was taken from was where a purse of money had been kept for a considerable time—the person must have known that as the articles were taken from the corner in which the purse was usually kept—the corner was rummaged about—the prisoner was then brought to me from the kitchen—I said I must examine you a serious robbery has been committed in this house —she said Well you may —I put several questions to her—she said But why am I questioned more than any one else I have not been up stairs since the morning —I said It is necessary that all parties should be examined —she was very reluctant to be examined—the barman was then examined—a few days afterwards in consequence of what I heard from him I gave instructions for the prisoner to be taken—she was searched and nothing found on her—a person must pass the tap-room door to get to the skittle-ground which is a very confined one to pass through the window into the kitchen WILLIAM BEAL I am barman to Mr Theodore On the Thursday afternoon about five minutes to two o clock I went into the bar and remained there till twenty-five minutes past two—the family were at dinner they dined at two—there is a clock there—I could see the staircase that leads to my mistress s bed-room—the prisoner went up at five minutes past two—no one else went up in that time—I did not see the prisoner again till about twenty-five minutes to there after the robbery—if any men had come in for refreshment I should have served them—I served no one in that interval—if any one came in they must have had some other object ROBERT M KENZIE policeman B 5 In consequence of information I went to the Stag with the inspector and examined the house—two strangers could not have hit upon the money in the drawers—a corner of the drawer where the money was kept was turned out the other part was not disturbed ELIZABETH STEVENS I was in Mr Theodore s service About twenty minutes past two on this day I saw two men walk very quickly out of the tap-room—that is a different room to the bar—the second one had one hand in his trowsers-pocket—he opened the door with the other—I turned round immediately and saw the the prisoner come from the tap-room and go down to the kitchen—she had no business in the tap-room that I am aware of MARY MAXWELL When the prisoner was remanded I was locked up in the same cell for being tipsy—she asked the gaoler to write her a letter—he said he could not and told her to ask her fellow prisoner—he brought me pen ink and paper—she told me to write to her mother for a solicitor and to tell her brother she was in trouble and to bring her child to see her—I told her to tell her brother to do all he could to get a counsellor and she said none of the property was found and never would be—I said she would be transported if the property was found Prisoner s Defence I was not in the bed-room that morning the barmaid made the beds the bed-rooms were all left open the barman has said how easily any one might walk up into that room and we should be none the wiser and he was sure something would happen soon and the barmaid said she thought so too as she had bad dreams Maxwell said she lived with a man who turned out to be a thief and had got six months and she wished she knew where she could commit a robbery as she should value transportation I went into the tap-room because the barmaid left a shovel there MARY MAXWELL re-examined I never lived with a man and never said I did or that I wished to be transported—I was sober at the time—I was in the cell from three o clock in the afternoon till eleven next day Prisoner Q You told me you robbed a gentleman of his watch A I did not WILLIAM BEAL re-examined I never said I thought a robbery would be committed some day the prisoner said it herself ELIZABETH STEVENS re-examined I never said anything about the house being robbed or that I had had bad dreams GUILTY * Aged 27 — Transported for Ten Years

Prosecution WILLIAM SHIPPEY I am a horse-dealer and horse-slaughterer On 10th May I was in partnership with Thomas Fishpool that partnership is now dissolved—I have an agreement to that effect it is dated 15th June 1848—I hired the prisoner on 11th May to go and buy some horses—he was to tare 1l a week and he drew 6s on account—he went down with me to Hertford—I was taken ill there and obliged to stay at an inn—on 12th May 1 gave him 40l in gold in a bag—he went to Hertford fair to buy horses—he came to me at the inn in about an hour and said he could not buy anything there the best way would be for us to get to Smithfield—we came up to the Shareditch station—I went home because I was ill—the prisoner had the money and I gave him a shilling to pay his cab-hire—I thought it was very strange he did not come home and I went to the Brecknock Arms at Camden Town and saw him there at one o clock in the morning—he said he had bought two horses for 9l and two more of Mr Urling for 25l and he had left them with Mr Urling because he knew he would do well by them—he pointed out the two horses to me that he said he had bought at Smithfield—I did not stay above ten minutes with him—I then left him and did not see him again for three weeks when I saw him in Smithfield and gave him into custody—I got 5l from him at the Brecknock Arms—I have received no other money from him and no horses Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q What was he doing in Smith-field when you gave him into custody A Looking at some horses—he might know that I am in the habit of going to Smithfield I think he did—I did not speak to the prisoner before I gave him into custody—I had made a complaint to two or three policemen to have him taken—I cannot tell the name or number of either of them—I cannot read—I cannot tell the numbers on doors—I did not go to any station or before any Magistrate—I am not in partnership with Fishpool now—I suppose it is three weeks ago since I gave up partnership with him—I saw him here half an hour ago—the 40l belonged to me and my partner—10l of it was mine I borrowed it of my wife—the other 30l was between my partner and me—I sold five horses for it which were my partner s and mine—my money was laid out for them as well as his—I had 45l and he had 26l 10s —I swear these horses were as much mine as they were Fishpool s Q Did he not accuse you of stealing these very horses A I never knew or heard of it—I have known the prisoner a good bit—he did business for me two years ago—he bought and sold horses for me but he had never been my servant till this last occasion—he robbed me of 30l before—the Magistrate said I could only make a debt of it if he were a servant I could prosecute him—that was the reason why I made him a servant this time that I might

JAMES REYNOLDS I was a farmer at Stratford—I now live at 129 Bishopsgate-street When I was in the farming business Spackman was my foreman and lived in a cottage adjoining the stables and barn on my farm—I did not know Barker then—he keeps a horse and cart and a little greengrocer s-shop at Stratford—I had repeatedly spoken to Spackman about missing things—on 30th Aug they began to reap some wheat—I reckoned as nearly as possible that there would be very nearly forty quarters in that threshing—this wheat was different from any other in the neighbourhood—Spackman had the charge of the barn altogether before and after the threshing it is quite impossible that it could have been interfered with without his knowledge his cottage was close to the barn and no one could come to it without his seeing them—he brought the keys in every night and came to my window between four and five o clock every morning and I gave them out to him—he rendered me an account of twenty-eight quarters and five bushels—I have been a farmer ever since I was fourteen years old—I am able to calculate what quantity should be produced—the nature of the crop and the hours employed in threshing would be very fair data for the amount—on the morning of 20th Sept I went up to Barker—I said Is your name Barker —he said Yes —I said What did you do with the wheat that you carted from my house —he said I do not know you I have not carted any wheat —I said You carted two quarters and a half on the 5th and on the 6th —he said You know all about it I carted altogether seven and a half and six bushels I was employed by Spackman to do it —I said Who —he said Spackman Green and Oliver —they were men in my employ and were completely under Spackman s direction and no one else—mine was white wheat a little discoloured—when Spackman was in charge he said Master I hope you will have mercy on me in this case Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Had not he to attend to the live stock on the farm A Not at this period—when the threshing began I distinctly told him to attend to that only—there was no live stock at that time—I had no horse to exercise within the last ten months—there were some sheep belonging to Mr Lowe his man looked after them Spackman had nothing to do with them—Hickman and Green who worked with Spackman and Oliver on my farm have absconded—Spackman has a wife and six children Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Have not farmers complained of very great want of the fufilment of their expectations both in quantity and quality A Yes but I put the fields down at less than half that they have yielded other years THOMAS ADDINGTON policeman K 189 I took Barker on 20th Sept at bis house—Mr Reynolds gave him in charge for stealing wheat—he said I had nothing to do with stealing it I own I carted it I was employed by Spackman he paid me 5s for it and knowing he was Mr Reynolds foreman I did it —I took it to Mr Cook s mill in Manor-house-lane GEORGE ROBERTS I live in James s-place Stratford I saw Barker on 6th Sept in Stratford with his horse and cart with sacks in it which appeared to be full coming in a direction from Mr Reynolds —I got to Mr Reynold s in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards and Spackman was in the stable—next morning I met Barker again in Angel-lane with his horse and cart and five or six sacks similar to what he had the day before Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Did you count the sacks A No—I have known Barker twelve months—I never went to his house—I knew he had a horse and cart—I never knew him to let them out MARIA ROBERTS I am the wife of George Roberts About a quarter-past five o clock on 8th Sept I was going to work—Barker passed me in his cart—he seemed to have some sacks or a sack in it—I cannot tell whether full or empty—the mouth hung over the cart—he went straight towards Mr Reynolds s farm towards the potato-shed which is close to the barn—I cannot tell what he did—I saw him coming away and Spackman passed by the end of the stable towards his house—Barker was back at about half-past five—I said Good morning Mr Barker —he gave me no answer WILLIAM BARNARD I am in the employ of Mr Cook a miller at Stratford On 6th Sept Barker brought five sacks of wheat five on the 7th and five on the 8th—he did not say on whose account he brought them—the wheat was shot and ground—it was nearly all white wheat but discoloured—it was mixed with some more corn in a bin to be ground Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Do you purchase large quantities of wheat A Sometimes—we purchase wheat of various growths some white and red and some discoloured WILLIAM BONNICK I superintend Mr Cook s mill—Barker Came to me on the evening of 5th Sept and asked if I was a buyer of wheat—he brought a sample and said there was about seven quarters and six bushels—I agreed to buy five quarters of him—he showed me this paper 15 sacks 2 bushels to show the handwriting where it came from—it is dated Harlow in Essex—I gave 54s a quarter for the wheat—on the 6th he brought five sacks on the 7th five and on the 8th two quarters and six bushels and that I could not agree for—I did not purchase it then—I bought it on the following Wednesday —the markets were declining—I knew the wheat that Mr Reynolds grew it was white wheat—I had dealt with Barker before for wheat—he said this wheat came from his brother-in-law—he had told me before that his brother-in-law lived at Hailow in Essex—he had the sacks back again on the 7th WILLIAM POTTER police-man K 273 I searched Barker s house and found six empty sacks with W Cook on them—I asked Barker how he came by them he said they were sacks he had borrowed of Mr Cook to fetch some wheat away from Mr Reynolds farm and he had 5s a load for carting them—I sent word to Mr Cook and he said they were his sacks and he had lent them to Barker Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did you take Spackman A Yes—I said I took him for some potatoes and corn—he said I expected so but I am innocent WILLIAM YORK I am foreman to Mr Rees a timber-merchant at Stratford I know Barker—he said he had some wheat coming from his brother-in-law and requested me to write this paper for him—I did so Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q When was this A I cannot say—I believe the date is on it—it might have been four or five months ago Daniel Hayes a draper of Stepney and Mr Seagrave a joiner gave Barker a good character SPACKMAN GUILTY Aged 33 BARKER GUILTY Aged 42 Transported for Seven ears

discharged the prisoner on the 17th July—I cannot identify any of this property a great many goods of this description are made by a person in Northamptonshire—these are the same sort of goods that I sent the prisoner to sell in my shop—I have lost property—I was 65l 5s 2d deficient in my stock Cross-examined Q Was the prisoner the only person who had change of the property in the shop A Yes he had the whole power of disposing of the property he had to dispose of it in the best manner he could for my interest—I understand he had opened another shop three months before but I did not hear of it till three days before the 17th July—I took a person with me to take stock on the 17th July—I found the deficiency was 69l 5s 2d —I made the charge against the prisoner on that day—I used to give him an account of what the stock ought to be and he said it agreed—I have supplied him with stock every week and he said it was correct—I supplied him with about 90l worth of stock at the commencement—if I had the books here I could tell you—I only attended on those premises now and then once in two or three weeks—he gave me an account every week of what goods he sold and handed me over the money—on taking stock 1 told him he was so much short—I did not give him in charge HENRY VINE I was shopman to Mr Towers—tbe prisoner was also a shopman—he conducted the business of one shop and I another—I went to the prisoner s shop in Lambeth-walk with the policeman—I found some property there which I believe to be my master s—these two pairs of shoes I believe to be my master s by their particular make and the private mark—this is not my mark—here is one pair that have my own private mark on them—I have seen them in my master s possession—this tree is my master s we have the remaining portion of it and the same with respect to this other piece of the tree I found the whole of them in the prisoner s house Cross-examined Q Have you not yourself been charged with stealing some of the goods A No nothing of the kind—these two shops were in the same street—we were in the habit of going to each other s shops and obtaining what we required—one pair of these were in my possession at Whitecross-street—I identify them through their having been in my hands and then going into the prisoner s hands—I found them on the prisoner s premises—I will swear I have not sold these shoes—they were manufactured in Northampton but they have my mark on them in my handwriting—the prisoner had these in exchange from me for his master they still remaining Mr Tower s property—this is the mark I am prepared to swear to it—these others I believe to be my master s—my belief is founded on the style of the shoes—they have no mark the mark is scratched out—I went with the officer to the house in Lambeth-walk—there were no articles there for sale then—I found some of these in Piccadilly and some at Lambeth-walk WILLIAM ROMAINE re-examined Some of these were found in a court in Piccadilly—they were taken from Lambeth-walk there in a van—I was present when they were removed—I could not swear that this is one pair that was removed but there were a great many removed and Vine was taken to Piccadilly to look at these DAVID LANGSTON I am a butcher and live at 135 Lambeth-walk I let part of a shop to the prisoner which he kept for selling shoes—there were a parcel of shoes in his shop which were packed up and taken away in a little van Cross-examined Q Who took the premises A The prisoner—he slept there four or five nights—his wife and his mother slept there and a child—he has been in the occupation since May—I was present when these shoes were removed—I believe his wife directed them to be taken—he was then in custody on a charge of misdemeanor COURT Q Did he come every day to transact the business of the shop A Yes he took the prominent part in the business—the boot-trees were selected from the further end of the shop and the shoes from the stock in Piccadilly Henry Chesland a smith and William Wesley an agent for the Northampton boot and shoe manufactory gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 30 — Transported for Seven Years 
t18481127-101  101 SUSANNAH COOK and THOMAS MAIERS were indicted for stealing 23 paintings value 20l and 9 painting-frames 50s the property of Richard Gale the master of Cook and JOSEPH ROWLAND for feloniously receiving the same Maiers having been before convicted MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution RICHARD GALE I live at 47 High Holborn and am a picture-dealer—it is my dwelling-house—I have a gallery at the back of my shop up one pair of stairs—I keep some of my pictures in that gallery—I have also a small back room up another flight of stairs in which I keep other pictures—I was not at all aware that I had been robbed of any pictures till the 16th Oct —I kept pictures in that room and gallery which were not immediately wanted and I had not been up there for nine or ten weeks before I discovered my loss—Cook had been in my service for about four months I had a good character with her and believed her to be honest—I trusted her with the key of a door which led from the shop to that gallery—she had that key before we were up in the morning—on 16th Oct I missed pictures from the gallery and the room and on the 17th Oct I was in St Mary-Axe and saw a picture of a huntsman blowing a trumpet in Rowland s shop window—I knew it was mine—I went in made inquiries and waited till Rowland came in—I said I have been robbed to a considerable extent 50l or 60l if you will act straightforward and provided you tell me the truth and will give me every facility to find the person you bought them of and will not let any person know of the robbery that I may find my property you shall not be a loser —I further said My motive in making this proposition is that I may apprehend the thief and if I discover more of my property elsewhere I may claim it but he mentioned the robbery directly to other people he broke the promise directly—he said he had purchased the pictures of a person who gave the name of Falk who was introduced to him by a Jew that he knew very well and from whom he had often purchased pictures—I wrote down an address which he gave me—I found two more of my pictures in his window—I then asked permission to look round his shop—I found as many more pictures as made up fifteen or sixteen—these are them produced —here is one which is a cattle picture by Lister—he is a well-known artist whopaints inferior pictures at moderate prices—I had seen Rowland on the subject of this picture at my place—he offered me a sovereign for it and said he would give me a sovereign a piece for as many as I had of that artist—that was at my own place five or six months ago—after my conversation with Rowland I told him I should put it into the hands of the police and I told him to let the pictures remain where they were till I came back with the officer—I went aways—I left four on five of the pictures in the frames in which they had been taken from my house and where I returned in two hours or two hours and a haft with the policeman I said to Rowland Where are the pictures that I saw here this morning they have been removed out of the shop the frams are here but the pictures are gone —he asked me to repeat the promise I had made in the morning in presence of the policeman—I did so—he then said Now I will produce the pictures —he went to the hack premises and produced the fifteen or sixteen pictures that I had seen in the morning—three or four smaller pictures had been taken out of their frames— The Huntsman was not—the policeman told him the pictures must be restored to their frames—he did not restore the person of whom he had purchased the pictures—he said of a young man about five feet eight or tune inches high with a light complexion and a moustache—he said he had given the name of Falk that he was related to Mr Falk of Oxford-street—he was then cautioned to keep the pictures and I and the officer left—before I left I found about half a dozen more pictures as many as made up twenty-two—on Monday morning 23rd Oct Maiers was taken into custody and on the same day I gave Cook into custody—on the day after Rowland had been given into custody I found at his place three other pictures—that would make twenty-five—I found no others that I could swear to—just as I had found the other three pictures Rowland came home—he had been admitted to bail—he produced the duplicates of nine paintings which had been stolen from me—I saw them at the pawnbroker s at the police-court and they are now here—in answer to a question he said he had no duplicates—he then said I recollect I have some —he produced the duplicates and said I bought them of a man but I had forgotten the circumstance —I had told him that Maiers was in custody—the duplicates I found in his possession produced the pictures I had lost—I have lost altogether 110 or 120 worth 120l or 130l —they had nearly emptied the room and the gallery beside Croos-rxammetl by MR BALLANTINE Q You have some very good painting A I have none very valuable—forty or fifty pictures were found—some of them I had put away—I thought they had been seen too long—tins picture to the man blowing the trumpet is by George Haynes—this cattle Lister s he paints a are it many of these pictures but I never saw two alike—he has painted for me for several years—I never knew him to paint two alike—Rowland said he would give me a sovereign for this—I gave two for it—I did not show him any othei—the same artist has done pictures for the Art-Union for twenty or thirty guineas—they are the prizes in the Art-Union—I have known it to be the case that pictures which I get painted for 25s go there for 25l —I should say I have 500 pictures—Rowland has a great many—I should say there were 100 in his shop and perhaps 150 kept down stairs in a place which had the appearance of a workshop—I do not think I can pick out the nine pictures which I found after I found the first fifteen or sixteen—some of them were small and might have escaped his attention—I have seen him at picture sales—he buys a great many—he had not bid for the huntsman—in two or three transactions which I had with him he paid me for What he bought—he brought twenty-two pictures to Bow-street himself—the policeman told him to bring them and he did—the cattle scene was one MR CLARKSON Q Did you see the clerk take down what Rowland said A Yes—the Magistrate put his name to it—this is it—this other is the statement made by Maiers— read— The prisoner Maiers says as follows —Let the girl be discharged it was not her if I am to suffer let me do it Maiers Q Did you ever see me at your place A Only once—I heard the bell ring as I was coming down stairs in the morning about a quarter before eight o clock and I saw you speak to Cook—I did not see her give you anything—you ire the person who was there MR CLARKSON Q What took place A The bell rung and Cook passed me and spoke to him—they were evidently acquaintances—he then saw me and he said Does Mr somebody mentioning some name live here —she said No and shut the door in his face though they had been conversing as friends just before Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Have you a porter A An occasional porter—he comes to open the shop about half-past eight o clock in the morning—that is the usual hour COURT Q What was to prevent the porter gaining access to this gallery and back-room A The person must have gone through the shop and through the door which leads to the passage—the porter always opened the shop at half-past eight—the middle door was always locked at niuht and Cook had the key in the morning—the porter had no access till she let him in at half-past eight Maiers Q Did you sell any pictures a short time before we were in custody A Yes not on the Friday before—I sold some frames COURT Q Did you ever sell any to Maiers A No certainly not SAMUEL ROLFE I am in the employ of Mr Bunday a portmanteau-maker in Holborn I have seen Maiers at Mr Gale s shop-door twenty or thirty times—I have seen him speak to Cook before eight o clock in the middle of the day and in the evening when she came out for beer—I have seen him speak to her once or twice a week—one morning about three weeks before he was taken into custody I saw him walk up and down close by the door two or three times and when he got an opportunity he spoke to some one at Mr Gale s door—it was then about half-past seven or a quarter to eight o clock—I could not see who it was he was speaking to—I was sideways and the person was inside the door—after he had spoken to the person he left the door with two paintings one in each hand—that was prior to the shop being opened Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q What day was this A I did not keep it in my head—I have seen him so often—the shop opens generally about half-past eight o clock—it is never opened before unless the porter has to go somewhere else—I do not think I have seen it above once or twice in a twelvemonth—it was not eight when I saw Maiers at the door Maiers Q How did I carry the pictures A In your hands exposed—I did not see you with any other pictures JOSEPH GRAY I live at 46 High Holborn and am shopman to Mr Brown a bookseller I have repeatedly seen Maiers hanging about Mr Gale s shop before it was opened—I saw him for about four or five weeks before he was taken—when I have seen him go there he has had nothing with him—I saw him on two distinct occasions go into Mr Gale s house when the door was partly open and come out with a picture in each hand—I met him once in Holborn he had nothing with him but there was a lad behind with a picture—I looked into his face and he looked at me EDWARD FAULCONER I live in Pemberton-row Gough-square—Maiers lodged at my mother s up to the time of his being taken—he was in the habit of coming home with pictures between seven and eight o clock in the morning—he was not lodging at our place when he was taken—he left on a Monday and on the Thursday before he had brought pictures home in the morning COURT Q Did you notice the pictures he brought home A Some of them—this is one—this is another and this is another which he had looking at those produced Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q He his had this one a long time A Yes lour or five weeks Cioss-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you go to sell some A Yes—I do not know how manywere-sold but he told me he was to receive 17l for them FREDERICK FOX I am shopman

Maiers I did not pawn this large picture a man pawned it and I went into the shop and bought the duplicate of him Witness I am sure you are the person who pawned this one—I saw you on every occasion WILLIAM SMITH policeman E 30 I was taken by Mr Gale to Rowland s—I have heard Mr Gale s evidence—it is correct—I took Cook into custody on 23rd Oct at Mr Gale s—I found this letter in her box Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Was Cook there when you found it A Yes—the box was in her bed-room—she pointed it out as hers and gave me the key to open it JAMES JACOBS I am a translator of languages and live in Somerset-street I have known Maiers about four years—I know his writing—I believe this letter to be his writing—I would not swear to it This letter being read addressed Cook as My dearest and only-beloved Susannah and alluded to his desire to possess a keepsake in remembrance of her JAMES COLEBY I am porter to Mr Gale I never opened the door to Maiers any morning between seven and eight o clock—I have seen him a number of times at Mr Gale s door when I have been going to shut up in an evening—he came for the servant Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q What time did you open A At half-past eight o clock never above two or three minutes before—I have been there about eight and was let in b Cook—I then left and went away and trie door was shut after me COURT Q What was the earliest time you have been employed to remove goods A Never before eight o clock ABRAHAM MYERS I have known Rowland about twelve years I have a picture by Sherlock which I bought of Rowland for a sovereign six or seven weeks ago—this is it—it is a picture I could buy at James s for about 25s —Sherlock paints them for about 15s —I have bought them for the value of the canvass Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You buy them to sell A Yes I stood at Garraway s coffee-house for thirty years—I am not a dealer in great pictures I buy them to get a living—I get 4s or 5s by a picture—I know Maiers I bought three pictures of him—pictures of this sort are awked a bout—I would sell tlm one for 25s RICHARD GALE re-examined These pictures were taken from my gallery and wwre afterwards brought to the police-court by Rowland—this picture of The Irishman was not brought at all I found it on the top of a cupboard in Rowland s house—it is a picture by Flint and is not so valuable to me as to some others—it had the name on the back but it has been rubbed off COURT Q Has it occurred to you to be possible that under the pretence of courting Cook Maiers has been shown the gallery and that he had taken an opportunity of taking the pictures unknown to her A I conceive it impossible as he must have passed through a room where she was employed and up two flights of stairs to get to the gallery—it might have been done with one picture but not with all JOHN COX police-sergeant C 12 I produce a certificate of Maiers s former conviction at this Court— read—Convicted July 1847 and confined six

receiving the same MESSRS BALLANTINE and COCKLE conducted the Prosecution MARY BROWN I am a widow residing at Brain tree in Essex My husband Abraham Brown was in the employ of Walters and Son silk-manufacturers at Braintree—he died on 15th July—on 2d June I assisted him to pack up fifty-one yards and three-quarters of tabouret—it was packed in a hamper at Mr Cheeseman s warehouse at Braintree and given to Mr Cheeseman in my presence—this is the tabaret that I packed produced Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q That is like the tabouret that is all you can say A That is the tabouret that I assisted my husband in making I have assisted him in making many—here is my work I can swear to it—I made no other of this pattern—there has not been another of that pattern made in Braintree GEORGE CHEESEMAN I am assistant to my father at Braintree he is foreman to Walters and Son On 2d June I received from Abraham Brown the tabouret in question—I packed it with another piece of the same description—there was then fifty-two yards worth about 15l —after I packed it I delivered it to Willis Cross-examined by MR M MAHON Q Where was it given you A At the warehouse which is about a mile from where Brown lived—I cannot say whether his wife was with him or not when he bought it—she was in the habit of coming with him JOHN WILLIS I am a carman in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway at Braintree On 2d June I received a hamper from Cheeseman—I put it on the van and drove it down to the station and delivered it to Thomas Hayes in the same state I received it THOMAS HAYES I am warehouse clerk at Braintree station On 2d June I received a hamper from Willis directed Walters and Son Finsbury —it was then well secured—I also got this receiving-note from him produced —the hamper weighed 1 qr 25lbs —I saw it taken by Seabrook and put into the truck for the purpose of being conveyed by the seven o clock train in the evening—after the truck was loaded I examined it to see that it was all secure and it was so Cross-examined by MR M MAHON Q You receive a great many of these hampers do you not A Yes I recollect this hamper particularly because a letter came down on Monday morning saying it was 15lbs short of weight GEORGE SEABROOK I loaded the truck No 730 on 2d June and put into it a hamper directed Messrs Walters and Son London —the truck went off with the seven o clock train in charge of Bloomfield JOSEPH BLOOMFIELD I am guard from Braintree to Witham I received five loaded trucks at Braintree station—we left there at seven o clock and arrived at Witham at twenty-five minutes past seven—I there delivered them in the same sute to Hydra the next guard—my charge ceased there THOMAS HYDRA I am inspector at the Witham station I received the trucks from Bloomfield—I placed them in the side shed to go by the Colchester goods train and left them in charge of the night inspector Dunster THOMAS DUNSTER I took the trucks from last witness and delivered them to Hall GEORGE HALL I am a guard I took the trucks from Dunster and brought them to town—we arrived about thirty-five minutes past eight o clock on the Sunday morning JOHN ASHFIELD I received the trucks in town and sent them off the main line on to a side line—it was Hewitt s duty to weigh them Cross-examined by MR M MAHON Q Did you give them into any one s charge A No I left them there—I do not know whether a man of the name of Boulton was employed that morning on the premises—I do not recollect seeing him HENRY STAINES I am a carman I received the hamper directed to Messrs Walters —it weighed 1 qr 10lbs —I received it from Mr Tunstall—it was not opened in my presence JOHN TUNSTALL I received the hamper directed to Messrs Walters about half-past seven o clock on the Monday morning—I weighed it and found it was 1 qr 10lbs —I took it into the office and put it before the desk—I lifted the lid up and it was very loose I could have put my hand and arm in Cross-examined by MR M MAHON Q How was it when you received it A The lid appeared half open—I did not receive it from any one—I took it off the platform when I went to load my trucks—it was Hewitt s duty to put it on the platform MARY BROWN re-examined The tabouret was at the top of the basket and a paper laid on the top of it—it was not in a separate paper so that anybody putting their hand in might lift up the paper and take it out GEORGE HEWITT I am a clerk in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway Company It is my duty to see the trucks unloaded two porters help me—I unloaded the trucks which came up on the Sunday between three and four o clock on Monday morning—I remember a parcel directed Messrs Walters —it appeared to have been meddled with—I made a mark on my invoice and it was re-weighed Cross-examined by MR M MAHON Q What time was it weighed A Early in the morning—I go to work at one o clock on Monday morning Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Was it dark when you weighed it A No daylight we put out our gas at two and I weighed it at a quarter to three—when I weighed it I could have put my arm in and taken the remainder of the goods out COURT Q In whose charge are the trucks from when they arrive till the goods are taken out A I am not aware that they are in any express charge—they remain on the line on the premises—there are very few of the servants there at that time WILLIAM WELSBY I am in the Company s service When the goods arrive they are placed off the main b ne on to the siding that is not under cover—it is on the Company s premises there are gates enclosing it—they are left there and are unpacked on the Monday—we take no notice of the Company s servants going there they may go when they please other persons are prevented—I know Povey he works on the line from eleven o clock in the day till eleven at night—he does not work on Sundays—he would have no right to be there on a Sunday—he would know the premises perfectly Cross-examined by MR M MAHON Q If you saw respectable persons going towards the siding you would not go and collar them A The gate-keeper would not allow them in—he is not here—he has charge of the gate leading to the warehouse—I suppose anybody could get in from the Shore-ditch end—Povey assisted in getting the trucks down the line—he was not a porter he was only employed to push the trucks about—if a person in the employ of the Company were seen carrying a parcel he would be stopped—they are not allowed to take things out of the gate till they have a pass from the person who delivered them to them—the pass would be left with the gate-keeper SAMUEL THODEY I am employed in the granary department of the company 1 know Povey—on Sunday 3d June I was at the place where the trucks are to turn the trucks into the granary—I saw Povey come in from nine to ten o clock and go out in five or ten minutes—he was on the premises but not near to where the trucks are—I was there from twelve on Saturday night till half-past eleven on Sunday—I cannot say whether Povey saw me—his eyes were fixed on the ground and he was walking along steadily—I lost sight of him after going about forty yards—I do not know where he was during that time—I cannot say whether he could have got to where the trucks were in that time—there was nothing to prevent his walking to where they were—it was about fifty yards off Cross-examined by MR M MAHON Q Did you see him coming out again A I did—I was twenty yards from him—I did not see a parcel on his shoulder or in his pocket—I do not think he could have had it hidden about him without my seeing it GEORGE TEAKLE police-sergeant H 8 On 29th June I went with Shackell to the shop of Hampton and Russell upholsterers in Leicester-square and saw this piece of stuff in the window exposed for sale—there was no ticket on it—I went into the shop and asked the price of it of a shopman—he said 3s 9d a yard which was remarkably cheap—I saw Mr Russell afterwards and told him it was stolen—in consequence of what he said I went after Jones and took him into custody the next morning—I told him I believed he had sold some tabouret in Leicester-square a short time back—he said Yes I did —I asked him how much he had for it—he said he could not recollect what he received for it—I said I am bound to ask you where you got it from for it is stolen —he said Well I had it from a man of the name of Lucas he had it to sell —I then asked where Lucas got it from—he said Lucas made such goods—I told him he did not for I had known him many years in the coach-trimming line and he did not make such things—he then said Well he had job lots in exchange for other goods —I said This is a job lot it was stolen and I must detain you —I then went with Shackell to Lucas s house in Edward-street Bethnal-green—I saw him there—he knew me—I told him I was come to speak to him about a piece of silk goods that he had let a man named Jones have to sell—he said What piece of goods I have let him have no piece of goods —I told him it was a piece of tabouret and that Jones was locked up and had said he had had it from him to sell—he said I never did I know nothing about it for I am in the coach-trimming line which you know —I said Yes I told Jones so —I then took him to the station had Jones out of the cell and Jones said That is the man I had it of —I directly put him into the cell to prevent anything further being said—Lucas said Well Mr Teakle I think I can tell you a little about this —I had told him he must be detained—he said He did not exactly have it from me Mr Teakle but he had it from a man of the name of Thompson —I asked whether it was Thompson the scumboiler in Pel ham-street—he said it was he had seen the piece of goods Thompson had sent to his house to try to get sale for it as Thompson did not know the value of it but he did not know the value himself and he recommended Jones to Thompson to sell it Jones did sell it and they afterwards met at a public-house in Hare-street where the money was paid over and he Lucas had half-a-crown for his trouble—he did not say who the money was paid over by—that day I and Shackell went to Thompson s house in Pelham-street Spitalfields and saw him—I told him I was come to speak to him about a piece of silk goods that he was accused of having in his possession—he said I know nothing about any piece of goods I am a scum-boiler and you know that —I said Yes I do —I told him that a man named Lucas and Jones were locked up and he must go to the station for it was ascertained they had received it from him—he said he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station and bad Lucas out—he said That was the man where I went to see the piece of silk —I told him he must be detained—he was then shown the piece of goods by Mr Shackell and he said Well I have seen that piece of goods before it was in my house about three or four days —I said Well how did you come possessed of it —he said Well I will tell all I know about it it was brought to my house by a man of the name of Povey to sell that he had it three or four days Jones was recommended to him by Lucas to sell it as he did not know the price—I then asked where Povey lived—he said he did not know—or where he was employed —he said he believed he was formerly employed on the Eastern Counties Railway but he did not know where he was employed at the present time—I cannot recollect whether he said when it was that Povey left it—we went that tame day to the luggage department of the Eastern Counties Railway—Shack ell called Povey to him and told him he should charge him with stealing a piece of tabouret from a hamper on the line—I took him into custody and took him to the station—on the way I asked him if he knew a man of the name of Thompson in Pelham-street—he said Yes he did—I told him he was locked up charged with being concerned—when we got to the station I had Thompson out of the cell and he imme-diately said That is the man that brought the piece of goods to my house —I then put them both into the cell and told Povey he must be detained—Povey said he should like to see a piece of the goods—it was shown him and he said Well all I know about it I will tell you I did take that piece of goods that he took it there for the purpose of selling it that he was applied to to sell it by a man named Boulton whom he received it from—he said he did not know the value of it himself and took it to Thompson thinking he might know the right value—I think he said he had it on a Sunday that Boulton brought it to him in the street wrapped up in his cape—I afterwards went and found Boulton—he gave evidence before the Magistrate Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Did not Thompson say that he would have nothing to do with it when it was brought to him and it went away A No he said at first he did not know anything at all about it and when he saw it he said it was in his house three or four days—I have known him some years—I never had him in custody Cross-examined by MR M MAHON Q Did not Povey say he had got it on the Tuesday A To the best of my belief he said Sunday—I would not swear it Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When you spoke to Jones about selling goods to Mr Hampton he at once said Yes I did A Yes—I am not certain whether I asked him what goods and he replied A piece of tabaret but he was just as likely to tell me—he answered straight forward JOSEPH SHACKELL I produce a bill which I received from Mr Hampton—it was given by Jones—it is for thirty-eight yards and a half 2l 6s and receipted by him—it is cut into four pieces and stained—it has evidently been damaged by some person in several places—I took possession of it on Friday 29th June—I have kept it ever since and have produced it to-day—the prisoners all denied knowing anything about it till they were confronted with each other Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Jones never denied that it was his bill of parcels A No Cross-examined by MR M MAHON Q Do you know anything about the management of the Eastern Counties Railway A I am an inspector there—I know George Boulton—for some months the duties at the goods department have not been allowed to be carried on on Sundays—the only persons allowed to be there are single men and shelters—shelters are persons who receive the trucks when they come in and put them on the siding—it was not Boulton s duty to attend to the trucks on 3d June—neither he or Povey had any business there—I am certain Boulton did not work there that Sunday several of the witnesses did—the trucks are left on the siding till the morning covered over with tarpaulins—there is no one left in charge of them—a horse is used to make up the trains for luggage but no horse is used on a Sunday GEORGE BOULTON I am a carman in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway Company I know Povey—he was employed to shove the trucks about—I never gave this piece of silk to Povey—I saw it for the first time when it was shown to me by Shackell—my duty is O drive a horse on the line—on Saturday 2d June I left work at seven o clock at night—I went to work again at seven on Monday morning—I had nothing to do with unloading the truck No 730—I was not there at all on the Sunday—it was the duty of a man named Rogers to hoist the trucks and it was Welsby s duty to lower them—Povey comes on duty at eleven in the morning sad leaves at eleven at night Cross-examined by MR M MAHON Q When does Rogers come on duty A At one o clock in the day but not on Sunday—he is not here—he is foreman of the truck shelters—it was not his duty to bring the trucks from the siding to the warehouse—the shed is I should say twenty feet or more below the siding where the trucks are—there are steps which go up by the gate-keeper s box—it would not take a person five minutes to go up and down again—it is about thirty yards distance—I have known Povey six or seven months by working with him—I saw him on the Monday WILLIAM HAMPTON I am an upholsterer and general house-furnisher at 14 Leicester-square I bought this tabouret—I forget exactly how many yards there are the bill says thirty-eight and a half but I think it measures forty or so—there are about three yards at one end that is stained throughout and not worth a farthing—we thought we should be able to get perhaps the size of a chair out of it—we paid the value for it 15d a yard COURT Q Then was it cheap at 3s 9d A We should not be able to use much more than half of it we should eut it up for chairs or sofas we could not sell the whole for 3s 9d —that was the fault of a junior hand we were all down at dinner at the time indeed I was out of town at Highgate—of course we must have taken much less than 3s 9d when we unfolded it being in four lengths and very much damaged it is creased throughout—we never expected to sell it in that state—we of course expected to cut it up—it was put into the window because we often have parties come who want chairs and sofas covered—every piece of goods in the house is marked—this was marked at 3s 9d —I did not say it was very cheap—our young man did—of course they naturally say that everything is cheap—I would not give a farthing more for it than I did in the state it was—I know Jones—we have had chair gimps of him for more than two years—we have had no dealings with him for tabouret before—this came to 2l 8s but we made him take off 2s for discount that we regularly do five per cent off for cash—we do not generally buy goods exactly in this way—we buy as many goods as we can of the little manufacturers who bring them round—I bought this of Jones Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q He wanted 3s for it did be not A He asked 2s 9d —I will not be positive whether or not he asked 3s at first—I told him he must take it away it was of no use to us—he did take it away—he brought it back next day—I told him 1s 3d was my price and if he did not take that he must take it away again The prisoners received good characters POVEY— GUILTY Aged 36 — Transported for Seven Years THOMPSON LUCAS and JONES— NOT GUILTY

charging MERITY and DIPPLE with receiving the same MR PARRY conducted the Prosecution PATRICK EDWARD DONELEY I am clerk to Mr John Ruck who carries on business as John Ruck and Co at Topping s Wharf Tooley-street he sells grease lard and butter Butler and Finch were in his employ as porters In consequence of something we heard two policemen were requested to watch the premises on the morning of 9th Dec I was also vigilant—on that morning I received a communication from one of the policemen and I went to Wellington-street I saw a cart there which contained two barrels and three firkins—the prisoner Dipple was sitting in the cart—after a short time Merity came up the steps leading from my employer s premises to London-bridge he got into the cart and as he got in Dipple spoke to him directly he got in the cart drove on—I saw a cab and a constable who was with me got on the box of it that was about fifty yards behind the cart—I observed Dipple point me out to Merity directly he got into the cart and they drove on across the bridge—I then saw Dipple point out the policeman to Merity and directly he saw the policeman on the cab he turned back and drove over the bridge more rapidly than I could follow them—I followed as fast as I could and the policeman followed in the cab the cart went down Duke-street where the front of our premises are—I took a short cut and arrived at the back of the premises just as the cart arrived—I saw Merity and Dipple jump out—Merity said to Dipple Look sharp —they wheeled two barrels out of the cart and attempted to wheel them into the cellar I prevented it by seizing hold of Merity and Dipple and the barrels remained on the pavement—Merity said Let me go it is all right —I said No certainly not —I kept hold of him but was obliged to leave my hold of the othe—the policeman came up Merity then endeavoured to get me off him—he said Let me go —I said I will not —he swung me round and came over the cellar—he plunged into the cellar and endeavoured to pull me in but he did not—the policeman came up—Dipple had a barrel in his hand—the policeman took him—I went by another way into the cellar and met Merity as he was rushing up and he and I had another struggle in the cellar—Butler and Finch were taken immediately afterwards—one of the barrels was full of lard and the other half full—one of the firkins contained butter and the other two grease—the two firkins of grease had been paid for but they were all in Mr Ruck s possession—the other things were Mr Ruck s—Merity said to Butler You know Jack you gave me these things to sell I was to get a customer for them —Butler replied I know nothing but what you paid for I gave you a receipt for what you paid Cross-examined by MR PARNBLL Q Was not this what Merity said You trusted me with these things till 1 could find a customer A Yes Butler said I gave you a receipt for what you paid and Butler said I know nothing about anything else —I will swear he said that—there was a great deal of conversation—I think I was excited—I have been in Mr Ruck s employ four years and a half and Butler was there before me—I generally got there from half-past eight till nine o clock in the morning—I got there that morning five or ten minutes before eight—I found Butler there—his time for coming was half-past seven—I saw the cart on London-bridge about two minutes before I got to the premises—it was the business of Mr Brasher the warehouseman to keep the book in which would appear what is sold—my employer s son had sold these articles to Merity the day before—Mr Brasher and my employer s son have authority to sell—I never sell in the warehouse I sell when travelling—Mr Ruck himself sells—if they were all out of the way we have no means of selling—suppose Butler were to sell Mr Ruck would not take the money when he came—I know that Merity had not been a customer before—the business was John and Cornelius Ruck s but Cornelius Ruck has left and set up for himself—I do not know that Merity was a customer of the former firm—I do not know that Mr Knight and Mr Warren have had goods of the porters and afterwards settled with Mr Ruck—I do not believe it cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q Has not Merity bad dealings with Mr Ruck A I believe he had one dealing—I expect that has been accounted for—supposing Mr Ruck and the foreman were away I might sell goods myself—I do not think I should be doing wrong—I am quite certain if Mr Ruck knew that one of the porters had sold goods he would say he had acted improperly—I have no occupation beside being in Mr Ruck s service—I sold some spirits on one occasion—when I say I sold it I mean that I became a purchaser at a Custom-house sale for two or three friends and they paid me again for what they had and the same occurrence took place nine months ago—to the best of my recollection it has never taken place at any other time—on the last occasion I purchased eleven gallons of spirits to the best of my recollection and on the first occasion I think it was eight gallons—I purchased it for my friends—I permitted Butler to take one quart of it—I will not swear that I did not sell that at a profit Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You say Dipple pointed to a cab on which the policeman was A Yes and Merity turned round and saw him—they then turned in a direction to pass the policeman—Dipple drove the cart in the first instance but when they returned Merity drove—the policeman was in plain clothes MR PARRY Q Had Butler or any other porter authority to sell from you or your master A They had strict orders not to sell—on one occasion I myself gave orders to Butler not to sell in the absence of Mr Ruck ROBERT COUSINS BRASHER I am warehouseman to Mr John Ruck—I never gave Butler or Finch authority to sell goods—they had no authority to my knowledge Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Have you brought your books here A No 1 do not know of any particular sale to Mr Knight of Tooley-street—he has bought goods—he has had goods away without knowing what the price of them was when he has sent a printed order—I may have supplied him with goods without knowing the price of them—when such printed orders were brought it would most likely be delivered to me if I were out most likely to Mr Ruck—there are three or four Mr Rucks—they are not in partnership—Mr John Ruck senior is the only one—a printed order might be handed to Butler he would not execute it—I suppose there are thirteen or fourteen persons in the establishment to whom the order might be brought—there are two books in which an account would be kept of what was sent out one for the week and one for the fortnight—I went at eight o clock in the morning—the cart was not there when 1 got there—the grease would be entered in the book which is kept in my desk at night and on the desk in the day Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q What are your wages A 100l a year—I do not know what Butler s wages are—I am not certain that nobody else has sold goods while I and Mr Ruck have been away—others have sold goods besides me—I should not think it very irregular if I were to come to the warehouse and were told a purchase had been made and the money received—it would be more irregular for Butler to sell than any one else because he is not authorized to sell—it is not the custom for persons not authorized to sell MR PARRY Q You have authority to execute orders A Yes and Mr William Denny Ruck has and he does sell—Butler does not sell in the exercise of his duty WILLIAM DENNT RUCK I am in the employ of Mr John Ruck—I sold to the prisoner Merity two firkins of grease on 7th Nov I think at 35s per cwt —I should think they weighed about f cwt and would be worth about 30s —I did not sell him any butter or lard—the firkins and barrels that are here are my father s property—we missed one of these tubs No 48 from the warehouse which had not been sold—the value of the lard and butter is about 6l or 7l and the grease bought is about 80s —I never gave authority to Butler or Finch to sell—no one bad authority to sell in the warehouse and give credit but my father myself and my brother Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Had you given Butler orders not to sell A I did not think it necessary—I did not think a porter would undertake to sell—I have never ordered any of them not to sell—I missed this tub on the morning it was lost—it was there that morning—I missed two casks of grease which had been standing there the night before and which I had sold to Merity—I have been in the business fourteen years—Butler has not been there so long—I cannot recollect how long he has been there—I am twenty-nine years old—I began in the business before I was fourteen Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q Do you know of any other purchase made by Merity A He had previously purchased refuse stuff—I do not think he ever purchased as much as 10l worth—I cannot recollect his purchasing more than once of the old firm and that was refuse MR PARRY Q You missed this No 48 which was found in the cart A Yes I had not sold it nor given authority to Butler or Finch to sell it JOHN RUCK I carry on this business—Butler and Finch were in my service—Butler had 22s a week and Finch had 18s —they had never sold goods without my sanction—I do not know Merity and Dipple Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Would it be the practice that those who sold would enter in the warehouse book A Yes decidedly—they ought to be entered GEORGE WILD policeman M 94 On 9th Oct I went to a public-house from the back parlour of which I could observe Mr Ruck s premises—I was in company with Ayliffe—we got there about seven o clock in the morning on 9th Nov —there is a door at the back of the premises and a step or two and the cellar-flap is by the side of the steps where the crane is—about twenty minutes before eight I saw the horse and cart driven up by Dipple—he drove near the warehouse door of Mr Ruck s premises—he waited a short time and Finch came out and began sweeping—he went into the warehouse again and then I saw him lifting a firkin and Dipple put it into the cart—I afterwards saw Finch lifting another firkin and Dipple put it into the cart—I then saw a third firkin lifted and they put it into the cart—I then saw Finch pull the chain to let it down into the cellar through the flap and some one in the cellar fixed it to the barrel of lard—I saw a man who I believe was the prisoner Butler as it was drawn up push it so as to guide it on the pavement—that barrel came up and was put into the cart by Dipple and Finch—I then saw a tub standing on the pavement with straw in it—it was put into the cart by Dipple and Finch and the cart was driven up Duke-street—Dipple stopped opposite the steps and Merity joined him and got into the cart—I had seen Merity go into the warehouse before anything was put into the cart—the cart drove over the bridge opposite the Adelaide Hotel—at that time Dipple was driving—I took a cab and got on the box—I then saw the cart stop and turn round and they drove back as hard as they could past me—I turned and followed them to Tooley-street where the horse and cart stopped—I jumped off and saw Merity and Dipple pulling out the tubs and rolling them on the cellar-flap—I took Dipple and gave him to my brother officer—I then went into the cellar and took Merity—Butler was standing close by and Merity said to him Jack you know you trusted me with these things to see if I could get a customer —Butler said I gave you a bill that is all I know —this is the bill—it is for two casks of grease 1l 8s 9d Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Who is Dipple s master Mr Fletcher—he is here—the horse and cart belong to him—Merity hired the horse and cart and Mr Fletcher sent Dipple in charge of it with Merity—when I spoke to Dipple I found that he was apparently hard of hearing—I have heard from Mr Fletcher that he was an honest man—when I took him he was very quiet—he did not resist at all—it was from what he said that I went to Mr Fletcher ALFRED AYLETT policeman M 51 I was with Wild on 9th Nov —I have heard what he has said—I saw the casks pulled up by these parties—I saw a person who I believe was Merity go into the warehouse—I then went to Mr Donnolly who was at a coffee-house close by and then I went over London-bridge—I saw the cart with Merity and Dipple in it—it turned and I turned and went after it—I believe Merity was driving as it returned but I would not speak positively to that—I searched Butler and found on him 3l 0s 81l 2d —I found a savings bank book at his lodging Butler Finch and Merity received good characters BUTLER— GUILTY Aged 31 — Transported for Seven Years MERITY— GUILTY — Confined Eighteen Months FINCH and DIPPLE— NOT GUILTY 
t18491126-87  87 JOSEPH HADLEY RIDDELL and WILLIAM MOORE ECLIPSE RIDDELL were again indicted see page 72 for stealing a quantity of battens deals and iron brackets the goods of Edmund Pontifex and another their masters to which JOSEPH HADLEY RIDDELL pleaded— GUILTY Aged 34 — Transported for Seven Years MESSRS CLARKSON and PARRY conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM SPRIGGS I am a carpenter in the employment of Messrs Pontifex and have been so five or six years at a lead and chemical factory at Millwall—Joseph Riddell was the manager I received my directions from him—William Riddell was employed there I do not know what as—he was in the habit of giving me directions in his brother s absence which I obeyed without referring to Joseph—about July or Aug 1848 the prisoners resided in Birnie-street Greenwich—they had previously resided at the factory it Millwall—about July or Aug 1848 I was employed in making and fitting-up a green-house with Harrison and Miller—Joseph Riddell first gave me directions about it William was not present—in consequence of those directions I prepared a plan and estimate and about a fortnight after set about making it—I cannot say whether William Riddell spoke to me about it before I set about making it—I made it up of some deals that came in the yard—they were brought in during the time—they were not there previously—I was ordered to select what I wanted from that sample that came in and to give Mr Joseph an account of them—those deals were brought in for die general purposes of the factory—I selected about ten twenty-feet deals and ten twentv-feet battens—the deals were worth about 50s and the battens perhaps 355 —I had to order two sawyers to cut them into the requisite thickness—the deals were about nine inches wide and three inches thick and the battens seven inches wide and two and a half thick—I then began to work on them alone in the first instance in the carpenters shop in the factory—while I was working on them William Riddell saw them—Harrison commenced working at them it might have been the following day—William Riddell frequently saw me and Harrison working at them—I received directions from both the prisoners on the subject at different times—some window-sashes were made for the green-house about nine in front and fourteen sky-lights and rafters and doors besides—perhaps I might be occupied about ten or twelve days in preparing those sashes and Harrison perhaps rather more—during those twelve days William Riddell came frequently—it was their habit to visit us daily—it is not to be considered as twelve successive days because there were other things to attend to—when the work was completed we took it over to Greenwich—I believe it was Mr William who principally directed us to take the things over—Harrison and I took them—we were occupied about fourteen days or thereabouts in fitting up the green-house at Greenwich—William Riddell was there every day and Joseph also—I received directions from William as well as Joseph in reference to the fittings-up—the value of the green-house when completed was between 19l and 20l —I received my wages the whole of the time in the usual way in the counting-house from Mr Jones—William Riddell was not in the habit of being present when I received my wages he might have been there at times but he took no part in it—some iron brackets were necessary for putting up the green-house that was for the internal fittings—I think Mr William gave me directions to order Upstill the smith to make them—he made them in the smiths shop at Millwall from the iron on the premises—I received them from him when they were made—the prisoners saw me putting tip the brackets at Greenwich—the valne of the brackets might be about 8l Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Were the brackets taken from the premises at the same time with the deals A No I am still in Messrs Pontifex s employment—I have had no warning to leave—the deals came into stock after the estimate was made—I cannot tell where they came from—I saw them when they were in—I do not think there were deals enough in stock before they came to have been employed on the green-house—I have used those deals for the general purposes of the factory under Joseph Riddell s direction on the premises—no deals were pointed out to me as being deals belonging to Joseph Riddell—I do not know who ordered the stores—this was a manufactory for chemical purposes—previous to going to Birnie-strect the prisoners lived on the premises—I am not aware that the deals in stock were applied for any repairs to the rooms they occupied en the premises—I believe they both attended every day unless sickness prevented them—they were there on Sundays—William Riddell was ill at different times—a quantity of paint and other things are used in the factory—I do not remember receiving any directions from William with reference to the deals for the green-house—he frequently saw roe at work on the green-house he might have given orders about it I cannot swear that he did—the plan was prepared and there was no variation from it JOHN HARRISON I am a carpenter in the employment of Messrs Pontifex at their manufactory at Mill wall and was so in July 1848—I was engaged in preparing the green-house and afterwards in fitting it up at Greenwich—I was engaged about fourteen days in preparing it and fourteen or fifteen days in working on it at Greenwich—I first received directions from Spriggs about it—the deals and battens were then prepared—the prisoners were in the habit of coming in to the carpenters shop sometimes together sometimes alone while we were working—a roan named Miller was also employed at it—William Riddell did not give me any directions—I went with the green-house to Greenwich on the day it was taken—William Riddell was at times present while I was fitting it up at Greenwich and Joseph also—William gave me no orders or directions about it while I was fitting it up—Spriggs was the foreman of the carpenters I received my orders from him—I never heard William Riddell give Spriggs orders neither at Millwall or Greenwich—Mr Jones paid me my wages during this time—I have since seen the materials that I fitted up at Greenwich—some of them are here Cross-examined Q Are you still in the employment of Messrs Pontifex f A Yes I did not give any information to Messrs Pontifex while this work was going on—I had no suspicion whatever HENRY MILLER I was employed in July and August 1848 by Messrs Pontifex as a carpenter at Millwall—Spriggs engaged me and I worked under his direction WILLIAM UPSTILL I am an engine-driver in the employment of Messrs Pontifex About July 1848 1 made some iron brackets—William Riddell told me that Spriggs wanted some made and I made them under his orders—I have no recollection of William Riddell giving me any measurement of them—I then acted under Spriggs s orders and made the brackets—I cannot state how long I was employed upon them for I had other work to attend to—the prisoners might have seen me at work on them but not that I am aware of WILLIAM HINDS I was foreman at the lead-factory at Millwall On 3rd Aug last the prisoners came to me and said they had heard that I bad spoken disrespectfully of them and through that we must part—they both spoke to me—Mr Joseph spoke first—they said I had said they had been robbing their masters to a great extent—Joseph said he had written to Mr Pontifex and it was Mr Pontifex s wish that I should be discharged forthwith—I denied having said that they had robbed their masters—they said two or three had told them the same and therefore they must believe it—I said no more—I was discharged by them at that time—Joseph paid me my wages that evening William was present—after paying me Joseph said if I wished for any personal reference at any time he would give it—I gave up my keys on that occasion to Mr William—he said he always wished to return good for evil and if I wished for any personal reference or anything they could potsibly do for me they would do so—I afterwards went to Shoe-lane to see Mr Pontifex but was unable to do so—I received a character from Joseph Riddell on 10th Aug —I afterwards saw Mr Pontifex Cross-examined Q Did you know anything of the removal of the deals of which this green-house was formed A No I saw them at work upon the green-house—I did not know whether they were employed properly or improperly CHARLES JONES I am clerk and cashier to Messrs Pontifex—I am prin-cipally employed at their copper factory in Shoe-lane It was always my duty to pay the wages of the men employed in the factory at Millwall—the time-book was sent up every Saturday morning with the account of the men s time in it reckoned out against each man and placed to it the amount of money he ought to receive—it was put into bags by the person appointed at-Shoe-lane—the whole was given to me—I took it down to Millwall and gave to each man and woman the amount coming to them as I received it—I always paid the wages at Millwall out of Messrs Pontifex s money—I never received a farthing from the prisoners to pay wages with—I always went down to Millwall myself—Mr Joseph was generally in the counting-house when I paid the wages—Mr William s duties were very numerous his principal duty was to attend to the women in the white-lead works Cross-examined Q Was William very constantly there A I beliew always—I always considered he attended very assiduously to the works that were going on—I was never there on a Sunday—after a time his health suffered very much indeed EDMUND PONTIFEX I am partner with my brother in the copper-worki at Shoe-lane and the factory at Millwall—Joseph Riddell was appointed our manager about 1843 after that he requested the assistance of his brother William and we permitted it—William had no particular duties but was to give general assistance to his brother—he received a salary he was a kind of joint-manager with his brother—I think William came into the employment very shortly after Joseph—I have given instructions to William in reference to his duties both in the presence of his brother and separately—I have re-peatedly given William instructions as well as Joseph that not a single thing should go off the premises at any time without express orders from Shoe-Jane—we had generally a stock of timber in use at the factory—I gave no instructions to either of the prisoners in July or Aug 1848 to use timber for the erection of a green-house at their house at Greenwich neither of them told me they had done so—I received a letter from Joseph on or about 3rd Aug last—this is it produced —I had received no information from either of them about the timber before that—I never received any communication from William and except this letter I never had any communication from Joseph—I had not given Joseph authority to discharge Hinds—I was constantly in the habit of seeing Joseph—about 15th Sept last in consequence of some information I received I had an interview with Joseph—William was not present at that interview—I had prior to that given both the prisoners notice to leave—they had first given me notice—William and Joseph were always one and the same—William did not give me any notice either in writing or by word of mouth what was done with one was done with the other—my communications were with Joseph and frequently with William together constantly they were together at the works Q In reference to their being discharged had you any communication with Joseph and William A I believe they were both together frequently and talking about it—after they first gave me notice they wished to retract it and earnestly wished me to continue them—that was about April or May last—I told them that I had not felt satisfied with the repeated charges that had been made against them and their whole conduct whilst they were with us and therefore 1 could not allow them to retract it and in July a Mr Durdon came in the place of Joseph Riddell—I have seen William Riddell s hand-writing very often looking at a book —I have no doubt whatever that the whole of this is his writing and this also looking at another Cross-examined Q If I understand you aright you authorized Joseph to take his brother into the concern A I did I cannot recollect whether I had any direct communication with William until he had been hired by his brother—it is six years ago I cannot recollect either one way or the other—he had thirty shillings a week—Joseph had at first 150l a year then 500l then 250l —the operations were not very extensive—in the course of five years 100 000l worth of stock passed through their hands lead and a variety of things—the deals that were brought on the premises were for repairs of the factory making utensils for the factory boards for the white-lead works and for a variety of purposes attaching to the place—we have a variety of timber-merchants—we paid them at Shoe-lane—we no doubt bought them cheaper than a small consumer would—sometimes they were sent direct to Millwall by the timber-merchant and sometimes a barge has been sent—Joseph was allowed to occupy some portion of our premises and William with him—the permission was originally given to Joseph—I do not think he occupied the premises at first but I cannot charge my memory—it was a very short time after as soon as the rooms could be got ready COURT Q What interval of time was there between Joseph s first commencing the superintendence and William s coming to his assistance A I cannot charge my memory with that but I think only a very short time—I think he very soon introduced his brother—I do not think it was so much as three months as far as my recollection goes I should say between three and four weeks but I cannot recollect at this distance of time one way or the other—Joseph had no authority to order any stores into the factory—I believe he has frequently done it for which we have sent reprimands down to him prohibiting him from doing so—he was authorized to order some little tubs but never deals and battens JOSEPH HEDINGTON City policeman No 20 I apprehended Joseph Riddell on 15th Sept last and William on the 18th in Birnie-street Greenwich—I told William I was an officer that he was charged with his brother with stealing sixteen sacks and a half of coke a quantity of wood a quantity of tartar and other goods the property of Messrs Pontifex—I am not quite clear whether I used the word wood I think I did—he said it was a bad job—I searched the house at Greenwich and found the green-house there the materials of which have been removed a portion of them are outside—I found these two books in the house—I went to the flour-sack factory at Lee that was on the 15th after apprehending Joseph—I went to the house is Birnie-street and saw William that was previous to my taking him into custody—I then told him that his brother was in custody on a charge of robbery and I said I must search the place—I then brought away a quantity of papers—I asked him if they had a factory at Lee—he said they bad—I asked him who I should find in charge of it—he said a man named Godwin and he directed me where to find it—I asked him to give me up all the books and papers that he had relative to the factory at Lee and he gave me these among some others— These books were headed J H and W M E Riddell EDMUND PONTIFIZ re-examined Until the policeman found these books I was not aware that the prisoners were carrying on a factory at Lee—they had no right as my servants to carry on an independent business without my knowledge Richard Beck optician of 6 Coventry-street and William Fawcett timber-merchant of Mill wall deposed

morning I saw both the prisoners riding on the front of one of Messrs Emanuel s carts which was coming in a direction from their warehouse about a quarter of a mile from it—there were three bags of rags on the cart which I could see and the body of the cart would hold about two bags it was a small cut they were partly covered with a tarpaulin—it was going in a direction towards Oxford-street in a straight direction towards Bayes s house—on 24th May about half-past eight in the evening I went to Bayes s house—I told him I wanted him for receiving three bags of rags the property of Messrs Emanuel knowing them to be stolen—he said he was packing some rags and he asked me to allow him five minutes to go down stairs to finish his job—I said No he must consider himself my prisoner and go the station—he then sat down on a bed in the parlour and began crying—he said Now I am done Cross-examined by MR COCKLE Q Were you in uniform A No in plain clothes—there was a constable with me in plain clothes—I know the prosecutor s premises—I never saw them send out goods so early as that—I have seen them send out at seven or eight o clock in the morning not before—I was present when Lawrence was taken into custody on the 23rd May about six in the evening Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Do you know Mr Emanuel s sons A He has two sons I do not know which you allude to—Bayes s place is in Tom s-court which leads out of Duke-street Grosvenor-square—Mr Emanuel has one son in Henrietta-street and his son-in-law carries on a business in rags I think in the next street to Bayes RICHARD BARBER policeman D 288 On 18th May I saw Lawrence come out of Messrs Emanuel s rag-stores at a little after half-past four o clock in the morning—he had a horse and cart with some bags of rags—I thought there were either three or five bags—he drove in the direction of Oxford-street—I saw him come with the horse and cart which had the tarpaulin in it which when he went out was covered over the bags Cross-examined by MR COCKLE Q Were you in uniform that morning A I was on duty in uniform—I did not notice any one else about—there were persons going to work Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When the cart went out there was only Lawrence with it A No and when it came back there was no one but him WILLIAM KEECH policeman C 102 I know Bayes On Sunday night 12th May my beat was in his neighbourhood—he told me he wanted to be called on Monday morning at three o clock—I called him—he said he was going to fetch some tailors cuttings and he was obliged to go early after them—at a few minutes before five o clock that morning I was standing at the corner of Duke-street—I saw a cart which Lawrence was driving there was no one else with it—it was drawn to Duke-street opposite Tom s-conrt where Bayes lives—after the cart had stopped there I saw Bayes come across Oxford-street towards his own house—that was the same way I had seen the cart come—Bayes asked me to have something to drink—I was willing to have something if there was a house open—I afterwards saw the cart and some bags containing rags—I will not be positive whether there were five or six in all but Lawrence had taken two or three off the cart before Bayes got to it and they laid in the archway—they were then all taken off by Lawrence and put under the arch and then Lawrence and Bayes both carried them into Bayes s house—on the Wednesday evening afterwards at a little after nine Bayes was standing at his shop door and he said to me I am going to send my man for a drop of porter will you stop and have a drop —he sent his man for a pint of porter and I went into the shop and drank the porter with him and his man—he said he had sold the rags which he purchased on Monday morning and he said to whom he had sold them hut I forget who—I think he said he sold them the same day or the next morning—he said he had cleared 4s 3d a cwt by them—on the Saturday after Bayes was taken on the Friday I saw the same cart which I had seen on that Monday morning at Mr Emanuel s with four or five others—I picked out the cart and the horse and harness—I went there for the purpose of seeing whether I could recognize it Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was it not 4s 6d a cwt that he said he had cleared A I believe it was 4s 3d —I cannot tell whether I always thought it was 4s 3d but I can look in my pocket-book for I made a memorandum afterwards to see what the man got for his day s work—I think in the whole it was 1l 18s 3d —when he told me he was going to fetch tailor s cuttings I do not know that he told me where he was to fetch them from CHARLES MOORE I am a rag-merchant and live in Grafton-streer Soho I know Bayes On Tuesday 14th May he came to a public-house at the corner of Litchfield-street about half-past eleven o clock—he told me he had about 8cwt of water-flock if I would purchase it—I asked him the price—he said 9s per cwt —I said I would give it him if it was good—he said he had bought it as a guess lot but he had not paid the party—I went to Tom s-court to look at it—he took me into a shed at the back part of the house and showed me two bags of rags or water-flock and the other three bags were covered with another sort of rags—I bought them of him at 9s a cwt —he brought them to my house and I weighed them—they were 6 cwt 2qrs 14 lbs —I paid him 2l 19s 7d —when he brought them to my door I saw my cousin Henry Moore who is occasionally employed by the prosecutor s son—when Bayes saw my cousin he said Here comes your cousin don t say you bought them of me but tell him that you employed me for an hour to draw the truck —there was nothing else passed—I had the rags cut up and sold them—they were in five bags—I delivered two of them to the constable—I believe these are them—I cannot swear to these being the bags ANN SEABORNE I am the wife of Thomas Seaborne a rag-merchant in Grafton-street On 24th May I saw Bayes at my house—he asked if my son Charles Moore was at home—I told him he was not and asked him what he wanted him for—he said nothing particular only if any one should come round concerning the water-flock that he had sold him to say that he did not know him Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Do you live with Charles Moore A He lives with me—what he buys is for my present husband who is a rag-merchant—this conversation took place at my door—the bags had not then been taken from my place UZZIEL EMANUEL I am a rag-merchant and have one partner—I have a warehouse in Bentinck-mews and another in Marylebone-lane—Lawrence was one of my carmen Bayes was another but we discharged him on Christmas-eve—Lawrence had no authority to take out rags on the 13th of May on the 14th or the 15th—I come to business at half-past nine o clock—Lawrence comes to work at seven—five bags of rags would ordinarily weigh eight or nine cwt and would be worth from 4l 10s to 5l —I gave Lawrence into custody on the 23rd—before I gave him into custody I called him into my son s room and told him I had had information he had been robbing me for some length of time—he said he had not Cross-examined by MR COCKLE Q You are in very extensive business A Yes as rag and metal merchants—I have three sons—one carries on business not on the same side of Oxford-street as Bayes lives one is in one parish and one in another—I have three horses—I have not done business with Moore I have with his father-in-law MR CLARKSON Q Had you authorised this man to take goods of yours to Moore A No JURY Q Had Lawrence the keys of the warehouse A He had the keys of the gates that lead to the stable and he had the opportunity of getting to the warehouse Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Do you know where you got these rags A I believe one bag came from Shrewsbury WILLIAM BURTON policeman D 82 On 23rd May I took Lawrence into custody—he was called in—Mr Emanuel asked him where he took the bags to on Monday the 13th of May—he denied it and said he did not take any out—Mr Emanuel said Here are two policeman who saw you —he said That is to be proved Cross-examined by MR COCKLE Q Did not Mr Emanuel say he would not hurt him if he told the truth and did he not say he had never robbed him of a shilling s-worth A Yes—I received these two bags from Mr Seaborne in the presence of Moore JOSEPH PARK I am in the service of Mr Emanuel—this bag is his—it has the letter Son it in my marking—I marked twenty of them about ten weeks ago seventeen were sent off to Scotland and there are two at home now PATRICK HISSON I live in Orchard-place and am in the

t18500916-1631  1631 EDWARD ROOKE WILLIAM LEGGETT and JAMES WREN stealing 2 cans value 2s and 20 gallons of olive oil 4l the goods of William Browning and others the master of Rooke —2nd COUNT charging Leggett and Wren with receiving MR PARRY conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM BROWNING I am in partnership with James Browning and three others we are oil-merchants and carry on business at 113 St Jobn-street Rooke was our carman and had been so about twenty-one months—Leggett had been in our service but left I think about April last—on the morning of 29th Aug my attention was called by our warehouseman John Huggins to a can of ten gallons of olive oil which was in our new warehouse—it had no right to be there—it was worth about 4s 3d a gallon—those fine oils are always drawn by ray particular order—my warehouseman marked the can in my presence and I left it where I found it—I looked for it between five and six o clock in the afternoon and it was gone—about eleven the same evening I looked for it with Huggins and the policeman and after some time we found it under some straw in the wagon which Rooke drove—there was another ten-gallon can with it of the same sort of oil—the value of the two was between 4l and 5l —they had no directions on them—I saw the cans again on the morning of 30th Aug —there was a direction on them then—they are the property of our firm Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q What did you do with the two cans when you found them A They were marked by the officer and left n the wagon Cross-examined by MR M PRENDERGAST Q How long was Leggett in your service A I should think about two years—it may have been five—I believe he is married JOHN HUGGINS I am foreman to Messrs Browning I have heard Mr Browning s evidence it is correct—Rooke drove the wagon—on 30th Aug between five and six o clock in the morning I saw the cans—Rooke came to work about six and about nine he took the wagon out of the yard to the front of the premises to have it loaded—he bad a load of five pipes of seal-oil—he helped to load the wagon and was in it—I gave him a delivery-note for these five pipes of oil—he had not to take two cans of fine olive-oil—when goods are sent out it is a rule that delivery-notes are to be given with them—four of those pipes were to go to Hale s Wharf and one to Topping s Wharf—I do not know how the cans of oil got into the wagon—I gave no order for their being taken Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q You know Rooke well and know that your employers had a good character with him A Yes it was Rooke s duty to deliver oils to the direction they were sent to—I do not know that if cans of oil have got into the cart they have been brought back—I remember about six months ago twenty-nine barrels of oil were to be shipped and Rooke brought back one cask finding he bad one too many—about six weeks ago he took a cask of oil to Fenning s Wharf—they could not take it—the ship would not sail for a month—it ought to have been taken to another wharf and he brought it back JOHN ROBERT HUGGINS I am the son of the last witness and am in Messrs Browning s employ I saw the two cans in the wagon on Friday morning between five and six o clock—Rooke came to work about six—I watched him and saw him get into the wagon and move the straw about between seven and eight—no one got in but him—he had 22s a week—he had 10s that morning to pay for storeage Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q The straw was all over the wagon A Yes there might be a truss of straw—a cart was near when this wagon was loaded—I cannot say how many things were to be put into the wagon and cart—when one is drawn out another comes up to be loaded—perhaps five or six wagons may be loaded in a day JOHN GUNN police-sergeant G 8 I was watching the premises and raw the can of oil marked—at eleven o clock at night I saw the two cans in the wagon and they were marked in my presence and Mr Browning s and the warehouseman s—I was there next morning to watch—Rooke came at six—he went to breakfast and came back and then the wagon was loaded with five pipes of oil—we followed it to London-bridge and saw Leggett and Wren walking backwards and forwards on London-bridge—Leggett nodded to Wren and Wren returned it—the wagon and Rooke were then in their sight—they let the wagon pass and followed it at about 100 yards distance—it drew up at Topping s Wharf in Tooley-street—it drew under the arch-way and the crane was thrown down to unload it—Leggett jumped up into the wagon with Rooke who was there already and one pipe of oil was taken out—Rooke then moved the straw off the two cans of oil which were in the left corner in the front of the wagon—they had been removed from the centre where 1 had seeu them the night before—Rooke took off the tarpaulin and the straw from the cans—Leggett was looking on—they seemed to be talking—Leggett then put his hand into his trowsers-pocket and Rooke put his hand next Leggett s hand—Rooke then put his band into his own pocket—Wren stood close to the wagon with his face towards them—Leggett then jumped down—Rooke remained in the wagon pulled one can out and handed it to Wren who walked away with it—he then took the other and handed it to Leggett who was walking away—I apprehended Wren with the can on his shoulder and Tyler took Leggett with the can—they were the two cans which had been marked the night before by Tyler in my presence—Rooke did not attempt to get away—I told him to come out of the wagon—he said I have done nothing if anybody asks me to carry a can for them I do it —when the cans were found in the wagon they had no tables on them but when we took them into Tooley-street there was a bit of wood tied to the handle of each of them with Mr Hoole oil and colourman Peter-street Soho-square on it—when I saw Rooke in the wagon in the morning I saw him cover up some bulk in the front corner of the wagon—he put the tarpaulin over it so as that no one could see what was under it—he was searched and 2l 2s 2d found on him—he said he had got 10s of it from his masters to pay the storeage Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q Were you employed as a detector A Yes I always am—we do not get anything else for that—Rooke was the only person that was in the wagon—three or four men rolled these pipes of wine but none of them went into the wagon—it took about ten minutes to load it—I was close to them looking down on them from the first-floor window Cross-examined by MR M PRENDERGAST Q You walked after the wagon A Yes I never lost sight of it—when I first saw Leggett and Wren they were at this end of London-bridge coming across from the other side of the water—I took Leggett about ten o clock as soon as he had left the wagon with the oil—he was going towards London-bridge HENRY TYLER policeman A 114 I was with Sergeant Gunn—I saw Rooke place some straw over something at the head of the wagon—I followed the wagon—I saw Leggett and Wren in King William-street—when they were on the bridge the wagon was in sight in front of them—they followed it to Topping s Wharf and Leggett pulled off his jacket tod got up into the wagon—he assisted in putting the hooks on the cask of oil that was craned up into the warehouse—he then put his hand into his pocket and passed something to Rooke which Rooke put into his pocket—Leggett then got down and Wren came across to the wagon—Rooke gave him one can of oil—then Leggett came and Rooke gave him a can of oil—I took Leggett—I charged him with receiving the oil knowing it to be stolen—he said I was asked to carry it —these are the two cans that I had marked Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q When you saw the cans they had no address A Not when they were in the wagon but when I took them there was a label on the handle of each of them WILLIAM BROWNING re-examined One of these cans is the one that I marked—we had no customer name Hoole Rooke received a good character ROOKE— GUILTY of stealing Aged

ought to have taken it to Notting-hill—I told him I should take him into custody for stealing it and Boddington for receiving it knowing it to be stolen—I said I have seen that game going on for some time —I had seen the cart stop there before and Bowden go to Boddington s and bring out empty sacks and I have seen Boddington and him coming out of public-houses—when I told Boddingtou I should take him for receiving it knowing it to be stolen he said he had not received it—I said You have I heard the conversation —he said no more—I took them both—I afterwards took the delivery notes from Bowden—there were forty-three sacks of oats in the wagon and two empty sacks—on the way to the station Boddington said You do not want to say more than you are obliged to say —I said I shall say the truth and nothing more Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Excepting before the Magistrate is this the first time you have ever said I told him that I had seen this game going on before A I do not think I did but it came out in cross-examination—when I went up the ladder following Bowden he had the sack on his back—Boddington was assisting him in taking down the sack—he had hold of the top of it when I spoke to Bowden—I have said that when Bowden saw me instead of putting the sack down he threw it down—that was before I spoke to him REUBEN RICHARDSON I am a baker and live in great Peter-street about 120 yards from Boddington s shop—I have seen Mr Meredith s wagon stop at the corner against my house—I have seen a sack taken from the wagon and carried to Boddington s shop and I have seen the man return with nothing—I can say that I have seen that three times the first was on the 21st of May about eleven o clock the next time was on 8th June about eleven o clock and again on a Monday between four and five o clock—I did not notice the carman I only noticed whose wagon it was—I communicated to Loome the officer the first day I saw it done Cross-examined Q Have you known Boddington for some time A Yes—I offered to become his bail on this occasion—if it had been anything but a felony I would have done it—I went to the station WILLIAM HUNT I live at the corner of Peter-street about eighty yards from Boddington s—I have known Mr Meredith s wagon stop opposite our door—Bowden has been with it—I have seen him go to Boddington s and take a sack and go there—I have seen him bring empty tacks back—I have seen this four times in the six weeks before he was taken—I have seen Boddington at his shop-door on those occasions William Bell of Vauxhall and James Sharpe of Horseferry-road deposed to Boddington s good character but William Newell policeman A 280 stated he had been in the habit of having convicted thieves in his house and William Millerman policeman 95 B stated he had him in custody for stealing a bushel of flour but the bill was ignored BODDINGTON— GUILTY of receiving Aged 42 — Transported for Ten Years

I have one partner we are auctioneers in Savillerow in the parish of St James Westminster None of the persons in our employ sleep on the premises—we occupy the lower part of the house our auction-rooms are behind—the prisoner was in our employ in June 1849—be had been so constantly about a year and a half and occasionally before—he was one of our porters—it was part of his duty to make fast the counting-house and rooms in the evening and take away the key—on Saturday 30th June 1849 we expected a parcel of plate from Thomas of Bond-street to be introduced into a sale on the following Tuesday—I left about half-past five o clock—the plate had not then arrived to my knowledge—we have an iron chest there I have one key of it and my partner has another—I took away my key—the persons there had no opportunity to open that chest—I left the clerks and the porters there—the gentleman who has the charge of the auction-rooms would leave at six o clock—the prisoner would remain last till seven then lock up and take the keys with him—on the Monday following I went to the premises—I found the clerks and porter outside the house—I sent for a smith and had the door opened—I went also over the premises but found no marks of breaking in—I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him in custody this month Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q How many persons did yon leave when you left A I cannot tell I think there would be four clerks in the counting-house and three porters—they might all have been there then—it was the prisoner s duty to lock up after every one have gone—we have a great quantity of property there at times JAMES EDWARDS I am in the employ of Messrs Thomas and Son silver-smiths in Bond-street On Saturday 30th June 1849 I took a parcel of plate to Messrs Rushworth s between six and seven o clock—there was a silver coffee-pot forks spoons ladles and other things—I delivered the parcel to the prisoner—he and Cordwell were the only persons I saw there belonging to Mr Rushworth—the prisoner unpacked the articles out of the baize and took an account by my list—he put it while I was there into a drawer of the sideboard on the right-hand side going in at the door—while I took the articles out he asked me which were silver and which were not because he wanted to put the silver away—the plated articles he did not want to know about—I answered those questions—they were worth about 168l for old silver—they would have been worth upwards of 200l in the trade CHARLES CORDWELL I was a porter to Messrs Rushworth in June 1849 I remember this plate being brought—the prisoner was there—the clerks had left—the plate was put in the sideboard and the prisoner put the key into his pocket—I remained till ten minutes or a quarter-past seven I then left leaving the prisoner there alone to lock up—I went on the Monday—I found the place locked up—I waited till Mr Rushworth came—he sent for a smith and had the door opened—we went in found the door of the sideboard open the drawer open too and the plate gone—the key was in the door of the cupboard in which the prisoner had put the plate—the plated things were not taken away only the silver—there was some green baize there and part of it had been torn away—I found this basket there which was not there on the Saturday Cross-examined Q How many windows are there A One towards the street—the shutters were shut I opened them—we take the goods in at the front door—we go through another door to get in JOSEPH POWELL In June 1849 I was in the service of Mr Squibb who occupied the upper part of the prosecutor s premises—they have two windows looking down Saville-row—the entrance is by the side of the windows—on Sunday 1st July 1849 the prisoner came there about one o clock—I knew him to be the person entrusted with the keys by Messrs Rushworth and Jarvis—he asked me if either of his governors had been I said I would inquire—I inquired and my fellow-servants said they had not—the door I opened led from the passage to the street—a person coming in at that door would require a key to get into Messrs Rushworth s premises—the prisoner took a key unlocked that door and went into the office—he was in there about twenty minutes—he brought this basket with him when he came—I did not let him out—I saw him go and he had a parcel tied up in green baize with a cord round it—the parcel was larger than this basket—I suspected nothing wrong Cross-examined Q I suppose you had seen him come to the premises before A Yes I never saw him take a parcel away before—he had been in the habit of coming on Sunday morning—he might have left some of his things there and I had that confidence in him that I did not think it singular GRORGE DAVIS I keep the Coach and Horses public-house in Conduit-street On a Sunday in last year the prisoner borrowed this basket of me immediately after the house was open at one o clock—I heard of this robbery on the Monday it was the day before that FRANCIS THOMAS WALL In June and July last year I was in the service of the prosecutors—I went to the office on Monday morning 2nd July and the office was not open—the lock was picked and I found the sideboard open the key in it and the plate gone—I had made a catalogue of the greater part of the silver plate at Mr Thomas s the value of it altogether was about 200l —the plated articles were left Cross-examined Q What were you A A clerk—I had been there seven or eight years—there is a window in the warehouse which has been sometimes open—there is a window in the auction-room which looks out at the back—I do not remember any complaints being made of that window being open it is nine or ten feet from the ground—there is another window in the same ware-room about the same height from the garden—there are two doors from the street one leading to Mr Squibb s and the other to the auction-room—there is no other door by which you can get to the premises—there is one other window close to the staircase it has a shutter I cannot say whether that is fastened I get there after it is opened and leave before it is closed—there are skylights in the auction-room MR BODKIN Q How high would a man have to fall from the skylights A I suppose about forty or fifty feet—the window on the stairs opens to the outside—I did not see any marks of violence ROBERT CHICKLEY police-sergeant H 16 On the 16th of this month I was on duty at Whitechapel-road—I saw the prisoner coming out of a public-house—I said Collins I want you for the plate-robbery at Mr Jarvis s —he said I am sorry you have got me to-day I was going in the country to-morrow —I said It is a bad job you must come along with me —I got a cab and took him to the station—in going along he said What do they value it at —I said About 200l he said It was a good day s work for the man that had it —after we got him to the station he said If any one else had had it they would have known better what to do with it —he refused to give me his address—I heard of the robbery in 1849 and had been trying to discover the prisoner GUILTY Aged 30 — Transported for Seven Years

the prisoner Mary Bowling by the day until a servant I expected to come arrived and she remained with me three days—after she left Miss Tomkins called on me for the character of a servant and I gave her the character of Kate—it was a good character—Kate lived with me sixteen months Mary Bowling Q Did you lose anything while I was with you A No ELLEN TOMKINS I am sister to James Owen Tomkins the prosecutor who lives at 97 Leadenhall-street In the early part of Oct I was staying there with him—he was in want of a servant and on a Friday in the early part of Oct the prisoner Mary Bowling called about the situation—she said she had lived at Mrs Kurcaldy s at Wapping—I asked how long she had been there—she said Fourteen Months —I asked why she left—she said the place was too hard for her there were four sons—I asked her whether I should be able to see Mrs Kurcaldy—she said Yes on the Friday or Monday —I called on Mrs Kurcaldy the same afternoon for the purpose of getting her character and got a satisfactory one of the prisoner as I supposed and she was taken into the service—she came on the following Thursday between four and five o clock and I left the same evening Mary Bowling I told her 1 was only three days at Mrs Kurcaldy s Witness No JAMES OWEN TOMKINS I am clerk to Mr Lee of 97 Leadenhall-street and rent the second and third story of that house On 10th Oct I took the prisoner Mary Bowling into my service—I understood from my sister that her name was Kate because when my sister returned from getting her character she said it was a very curious name Katura or some-thing of that sort but I called her Ann because I preferred that name—she came into my service on the Thursday and left the following Wednesday—she was to have 6l a year—I was to pay her half-a-crown weekly—I received an anonymous letter the same afternoon she left in consequence of which I went up-stairs and examined a box in my bedroom found it broken open and missed some trinkets and stage ornaments which I had seen safe on the previous Saturday—I then went into the prisoner s room and examined a box of mine there which I had left locked—I found a piece broken out of the bottom from the corner to the centre—it was safe when she came into my service—from that I missed some sword belts a cartridge-box three gowns a petticoat some gown tops bed sacking carpet a teapot a flat iron some dresses

Saturday with Jarvis and Finnis to 3 Compass-court Ratcliffe and saw the prisoner Wiggins and some Irish people there—we examined the house and on turning out a tin baking-dish I found these four ornaments of a sword-belt which are mine—Martin told me that the house was his—I believe Wiggins does not live there but he was asleep there then—I went again and found Martin Mahony Wiggins and a girl named Ann Nash—I had not spoken to Mary Bowling before she left about the box being broken but she saw me inspecting it—I did not threaten to send for a policeman or anything of the kind—I never gave her permission to introduce any one else into the house—I have seen a key produced by Jarvis which fits three of my drawers—Bowling did not give me any notice before she left—she did not ask for her half-crown—I did not see her again till she was in custody Mary Bowling Q Did you not give me the cotton gown A No I did not come into your room and take liberties with you—I was very ill with the

JOSEPH LOWTON I am fifteen years old In Oct I was living with Mr Lee who occupies part of the same house as Mr Tomkins—I knew Mary Bowling there as servant but not by the name of Kate—I remember on 16th Oct the day she left seeing her about half-past seven in the morning going out with a bundle—she saw me observing her and said she was going to take her washing—she came back about half-past eight without any bundle—Mahony was with her and Bowling said she had brought her to help her clean the kitchen as the other servant had left it in such a mess—they went into the house together and went up-stairs—the kitchen is on the first-floor—about nine o clock I saw them both in the kitchen—that was the last I saw of them JOHN ROBERT COOPER I am a canvas waterproofer at Mr Lee s On 16th Oct about half-past nine o clock I went there and went up-stairs into the back-room third-floor—as I went up I saw Mary Bowling in the kitchen—I did not go into the room—I afterwards went into the kitchen to warm some size and saw Mahony there—Mr Tomkins was up-stairs in the drawing-room I think on the sofa—he was unwell—towards the evening Mary Bowling came to the room where I was working and asked me where Mr Tomkins was—I told her I thought he was in the bedroom—she told me Mr Tomkins had been making a bother about a box which she had broken in standing on it to get at the window to clean it and talked about sending for a policeman—she went down-stairs and I did not see her again or Mahony—shortly after that Mr Tomkins spoke to me and I went with him to the bedroom and saw a box in the top of which there was a piece of about fourteen inches broken out—there was room for a person s hand to go in and take anything out—I afterwards examined a box in the prisoner s bedroom in the bottom of which there was a hole large enough to get anything through—I then went down to the kitchen and found both the prisoners gone Mary Bowling Q Did you not take some beer with me A Yes you were talking to the other woman about Mr Tomkins being such an indecent fellow you could not stop MARIA GREEN I am the wife of George James Green and live at 23 Blackwall-harbour Blackwall I know Mary Bowling by

her—her brother was there but I cannot say whether he saw her—I afterwards delivered the brooch and thimble to Finnis—these are them— produced —on the following Saturday Mary and her brother called on me about ten o clock in the morning—Mary said she came for the sovereign she had been locked up had been fined 1l and had pawned some things and wanted the sovereign to get them out again—I offered

him leave the box at my place till the Monday—I said I had no room for it as my room was let—he said Oh leave it till Monday it won t hurt and he went and laid it under the sideboard—I went in with him and came out again with him—he then went across the road where he had a truck which I had not seen before and Mahony who I believe is his wife was at the truck—he took this large box from it produced they came over to me with it—I went with them and they laid it down under the window—about five o clock in the afternoon Mahony came again and brought the sacking-part of a bed and said to a young woman Take it and put it on the box and wait till I come and take it away on Monday —the young woman put it on the box—we afterwards had some gin—I have known Martin ten years—I never saw Mahony

widow—the potman was the only man who slept in the house Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Is your house next door to the Casino A Yes it is not what is called a night-house for ladies and gentlemen—we generally keep open till one or two o clock—persons who have been to the Casino come in and take refreshment—we only keep open as late as three or four in the morning on bal-masque nights—the ladies and gentlemen sometimes come in in character—the house is very much frequented by fancy ladies and gentlemen—our busiest time is between twelve and one—we were not very busy on this night—from nine till twelve or one we had about sixty in and out—there is a water-closet in the yard—that bad been whitewashed as well as the whole of the yard—if a gentleman had been there he might have a little whitewash on his coat—the walls are whitewashed—there is a urinal there also open to all the customers—I have got back 41l 8s of what I lost MART ANN SUSANNAH FOXALL I am the prosecutrix s daughter and assist in the management of the business—Roberts was our potboy and I know White On 9th Jan I came home about ten o clock and went up-stairs at about a quarter to eleven—the first-floor bed-room door was then shut—I went to my room which is the same as my mother s and remained there a few minutes putting away my bonnet and shawl—the drawers were all safe then and the alarum also—it rang very loudly when I went into the room—when I left the room I shut the door I did not lock it sod came down to the bar—I locked the staircase door—from about twelve I assisted in the bar—the prisoner White was not then there—about twenty-five minutes to one the barmaid left the bar and went down the passage to the yard to the kitchen to get her candle to go to bed—I saw her come back again—she unlocked the staircase door and went up—immediately after she came running down again opened the staircase door stood there and beckoned me across the bar and while I was talking to her White passed me coming from the passage door leading to the yard—he shook his head in my face and said Oh Miss Foxall what is the matter —I said Mind your own business do not bother me —he had a dark coat on which came up to his face and his arm and side were white—he went out immediately—there were several persons in the bar—I went up-stairs found the first-floor room door and window open my mother s room open and the drawers lying about the floor in confusion and the alarum bell-wire put—when I went up and came down before the lower-room door was shut—from the time I came down till the barmaid went up no one had the key of the staircase—on the following Saturday in consequence of what the barmaid told roe I went into the bar—I did not then see White there but I ran out and saw him and took him by the arm at the corner of Little Queen-street and said to a policeman Policeman take this man into custody —the prisoner said What for —I said For robbing our house of 60l on Thursday night —he said Miss Foxall I have not been into your house these three days —I said Not been into our house these three days did you not ask me what was the matter and did not you leave a letter at our a house —he then came back to the house and then said Miss Foxall you must be mistaken —I said Policeman I am quite sure as to his being the person take him into custody —a man named Haskins has lodged in our house sometimes in the lower room and sometimes in the upper and White has very often come after his brother and when we asked him who was his brother he said I mean Haskins Cross-examined Q Did his coat collar stand up so as to conceal the sides of his face A Partly—it came just under the ears—all the people who frequent the house know me as the landlady s daughter—I do not go by any other name—we have had both Mr Haskins and his brother lodging at our house—those are the only two we have had for three weeks before the robbery with the exception of one person we know very well a gentleman a respectable man who is in the habit of sleeping at our house occasionally—his name is Davis but I do not know him beyond that—he is not a particular friend of mine—I am not in the habit of going out with him—during those three weeks the only gentleman we had visiting us who had occasion to go up-stairs was Mr Harker my brother-in-law—we have a sitting-room up-stairs but only our private friends use it not the common customers—our family only consists of my sister and brother—I am not married—I have no children—on my oath I am not married and have not three children my sister Mrs Charles Harker has three children—I have never had any children—I never was married—if any one has said so it is thoroughly untrue—I had been alone that evening to Mr Harker s 14 Argyle-street—I never went to the Casino but once and that was four years ago to see the Bedouin Arabs—there are no children at our house—what you have put to me is a downright falsehood MR GRIFFITH Q The collar of his coat did not conceal his whole face A I had seen him two or three times before—I know his voice—I undertake to swear from his person and voice that it was White EMMA HOLDEN I have been barmaid to the prosecutrix two years On this night I left the bar to go to bed at twenty-five minutes to one o clock—I went down the passage into the yard to the kitchen to get a candle—I lighted it in the kitchen and looked round to see if any one was there as is my usual custom and also into the water-closet and duitbin and in the yard and there was no one there but Roberts who was moving a ladder or steps close to the cupboard in the wall—I said to him What are you doing there why don t you do what you are told —he said he was only getting a duster—there was then no one but him in the yard—I came back to the bar got the key unlocked the staircase door went up and found the first-floor bedroom door and window open—I went up further and found my mistress s room door open and I heard a noise above on the third-floor like footsteps on the stairs—I came down again—Miss Foxall came to me at the bottom of the stairs and I told her what I had seen and while doing so White came from the yard door—he had a coat fastened up to his chin and went out—I stayed in the bar while Miss Foxall went up-stairs—White had been in the habit of coming for three weeks to see Mr Haskins who he called his brother and who had been lodging up-stairs in both the back rooms—on the Tuesday before the robbery White called with this letter produced —I know his voice and speak to him from his face and figure—I saw no one come out of the yard except Roberts who came almost immediately after him and went out Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Have you ever before to-day said that White was the man A Yes at Bow-street police-court—I signed my deposition and the clerk asked me whether it was the truth—he did not ask me whether I had anything to add or take away—White called several witnesses there to prove that he could not have been the man—that was the whole question before the Magistrate the witness s deposition being read did not contain anything about White being there —when it was read over to me I told Miss Foxall they had Dot got down all I said and she said Perhaps they have written down only a few of the particulars —I did not say anything about the omission—there has been a little conversation about the case but no discussion—I saw Roberts and the waterman speaking together that night—the waterman was in the house when we found out the robbery—an attorney appeared for us on the last examination but no evidence was read over MR GRIFFITHS Q Was it because Miss Foxall told you that that you did not tell the clerk A Yes it is a true statement—I swear White in the man who passed—I saw him come in the same evening at half-past ten o clock WILLIAM ANDERSON I am a waterman and act as a constable On this night I was at the prosecutrix s house and about twenty minutes to one o clock I saw Miss Foxall and Holden at the bottom of the stain and while they were there I saw White come out of the yard and speak to Miss Foxall he had on a dark coat buttoned up and had white on his left sleeve and hip—I had not seen him before on that evening—I have no doubt he is the person—after Miss Foxall pushed him on one side he went out into the street Cross-examined Q What do you mean by calling yourself a constable A I am told by the proprietor of the Casino to keep the gangway clear—I have not been sworn in—I have a waterman s badge—I bad not been talking to Roberts on this evening he stood by my side—I have never been in any trouble or before a Magistrate—I was not sent for at the police-court by Roberts—as he was going across to the cells he beckoned to me bat I did not go JOSEPH THOMPSON police-sergeant F 11 From information on 15th Jan I traced Roberts to Gravesend Chatham Faversham and Canterbury where he was apprehended by a Canterbury policeman at the entrance of the theatre and I asked him if he knew me he said Yes your name is Thompson —I said You must consider yourself in my custody for— he there interupted me and said It is all right I have got missus s money I did not steal the money I found the money you know I shall tell all about it at another place have you got that man in prison yet —I said There is a man remanded for Mrs Foxall s robbery —be said That is all right he is in it —after that the constable who had apprehended him produced two bags produced and said in his bearing that he had found them on him and 40l odd—I said to Roberts You hear what he said he says be found these bags on you —he said Yes that is all right that is my bag pointing to one and that bag pointing to this one is mistress s bag that the silver was in I had the money given me you must have another one describing a man who perhaps will be a witness to-day—the Magistrate said it was not necessary for me to describe him and it is not in the deposition—he said that a stout old man that was with White gave him the money down Holborn and told him to run away he gave him all the gold he had no silver—in hit pocket I found this silver Spanish coin with a hole in it produced which Mrs Foxall identifies—he said he had spent 7s Cross-examined Q Did you find Roberts had been spending money on the way A Yes I found 41l 10s in gold and 8s 6d in silver on him—after White was in custody he made a statement to me—I made inquiries and found it correct to the greatest extent—a duplicate was found on White for a coat pledged for 1s 6d on the morning after the robbery—I have made inquiry and heard nothing against White s character MART ANN FOXALL re-examined This is the bag in which the gold was—the silver-bag has not been found—this is the coin I spoke of—it was safe when I left the drawer Roberts s Defence The money was given me by an old man who told me to go away for a few days and he would let me know all about it MR PARRY called MATTHEW TRUMBELL I live at the Model Lodging-house 27 King-street St Giles s—I am a school-assistant out of employ—White lived there also and occupied the next bed to me I remember the Thursday evening previous to his being taken on the Saturday—I was in the kitchen and about ten o clock White complained of the closeness of the place and I walked down Holborn with him—on the way he met a gentleman stopped and spoke to him a few minutes and we returned to the lodging-house about half-past ten—about eleven he borrowed 6d of a man named Bumbury clerk to a barrister in the Temple and went out to get something for supper he returned in about ten minutes with some bacon and potatoes and we had supper together and I went to bed about a quarter to twelve—the prisoner came a few minutes after—I am able to say that from the time of his bringing in the supper and going to bed he did not go out—I saw him go to bed—three others slept in the same room in separate beds—White laid awake talking to me and Hall till nearly two when I went to sleep and I believe the prisoner also—I awoke about nine or ten next morning and found him in bed—he and I were in very distressed circumstances—I know Haskins he is an organist—he has a brother—I have seen Roberts at the Sun and Punch Bowl but do not know him in any other way—in the morning a fellow-lodger came to White and took his coat away to pawn it—the person who pawned it brought back something to eat of which I partook—I did not have any of the money Cross-examined by MR GRIFFITHS Q Do you still live at this place A Yes I have been there since 1st or 2nd Dec and I was there at the conclusion of last Midsummer vacation—I held a situation up to the end of Nov at Mr Dynes Bolton-house Turnham-green—I have not been in regular employment since—I have been employed by Mr Haskins—I do not know that he lived at the prosecutrix s—I have heard that he slept there occasionally—he lives at Mr Green s 89 Leather-lane tallow-chandler who is also an auctioneer and has an office opposite the Mansion-house—Haskins is organist at a chapel in the Hackney-road of which I do not know the name he is also a teacher of music—I have written notices of a musical book for him which were stitched as advertisements in the reviews and country newspapers—to the best of my knowledge Haskins still lives at Green s—I received 1l 1s for writing the notices which I was paid at Mr Green s office—I had received sundry small sums from him in the last two months—I have not received all he owes me yet—he is to give me 5l —that is all I have earned in the last two months—I may have received about 2l 1s of it before the robbery and sundry small sums—I have always said that 5l was what he was to give me—I will not swear I have not said five guineas—I may have said that at the time of the robbery he owed me five guineas—T had done work for him for which be owed me 5l or guineas and I had received at sundry times sums on account and I may have stated that he owed it me not deducting those amounts—upon my oath I did not say at the time of the robbery that Haskins owed me 5l 5s and that I had applied a great many times to him for it and could not get any portion—I have applied a great many times for it—this letter the one produced by Holden is my writing—I gave it to White to give it to Haskins—White saw me write it and read it afterwards—the address on the envelope is my writing—I wrote this last paragraph in the letter This at Foxall s to secure its falling into your hands because I knew he was in the habit of going there of an evening—I knew he lived at Green s then—I have stated that my reason for writing that letter was because I had asked Haskins several times for the five guineas and could not get it— the witness was here allowed to refresh his memory by reading over the letter —I do not believe I have stated that I could not get any portion of it—this is my signature— looking at his deposition part of which was read I considered Haskins owed me 5l 5s for the work I had done for him—I had asked him several times for a portion of it —I do not know Roberts except by seeing him at the public-house six or eight times when I had been there—I never saw him at the lodging-house—I know White intimately and am in the habit of going out with him—the rules of the lodging-house are to be in by half-past twelve unless you get permission from Mrs Davis the superintendent to be out later and she then gives permission to a person who has lodged there some years to let you in—when White got the supper this night there was a man named Kemp and Courtney Green Brown and Harley I believe in the kitchen and I think some others who I cannot name—I think almost all the twenty-seven who lodge in the house were present—Curling and Barclay I believe were there—Courtney White and I had bacon and potatoes for supper and Brown and Green also had bacon at the same time that was a few minutes after eleven o clock—Curling fried the bacon—I left White in the kitchen when I went to bed—I do not remember who else I left there—there is no partition between my bed and others—there is a door to the room—Hall s bed is next the door White s next and mine next—there is gas in the room MR PARRY Q What did the small sums you received consist of A About 2s at a time—this is one of Lord Ashley s model lodging-houses GEORGE BROWN I am a draper out of employ and live at this lodging-house I let those in who are late—they must have permission to come in late—I recollect on 9th Jan when it is alleged White was at Foxall s my attention was called to it at once and I went to the police-court to give evidence—that evening White was at the lodging-house from half-past ten till half-past eleven o clock—I remember his borrowing 6d of Bumbury going out and bringing in some bacon and potatoes—he ate his supper with Trumbell I went to bed at half-past eleven and left them at supper—I did not let White in after that if he had gone out and come in after half-past twelve I should have had to have done so—I sleep on the ground-floor and when a person comes he has to knock at my window which abuts on the street—the door jars against the partition of my room and I should hear if any one came in—I saw him in bed next morning—about two next day I pledged his coat for 2s a portion of which I laid out for him for a meal—Trumbell partook of it and I had some for going the errand—I gave White the ticket Cross-examined Q How long has this place been a model lodging house A I cannot tell I have known it three years—Trumbell has lived there six weeks or two months this last time and he has been there casually when he has been in London he has not been there constantly for the last twelve months—some of the men go out in the morning at five—they let themselves out—the house opens for the day at half-past six I do not know who comes in then—this supper was bought about ten or half-past—I believe White boiled the potatoes I cannot say who did the bacon—there are two tables in the kitchen—I believe Kempster and George Barclay were at supper on herrings and potatoes at another table—I had some supper with White and Trumbell and Green also and when I went to bed Courtenay was going to have some also—I have been employed fourteen months in letting people in—I get 2d each time from the men I let in—I do nothing but that and call them in the morning—for the last few weeks I have been delivering circulars—there is only one door to the house JOB FARLEY I am a hosier out of employ and sleep in the room adjoining White s at this lodging-house On 9th Jan I went to bed about a quarter-past twelve o clock—White was then in his bedroom—from my room I can hear people there—it was just gone one when I went to sleep and up to that time I had heard White and the others talking—I had supped that night with Kempster on herrings and potatoes—White and Trumbell had bacon and potatoes—I recollect the bacon being fetched—I saw White in the room

play a joke upon White by making what is called an apple-pie bed and in consequence of that I was awake—Trumbell came up first and White came after not long after because the light was not out—when White got into bed he found this trick had been played upon him—he had a difficulty in getting down and had to get out of bed again and remake it—Curling came in and laughed at it and White began to pummell him with the pillow and by that time it was nearly one o clock—White then got into bed—there was some talking after that and it was between one and two or nearly one before we got to sleep—I got op about seven and White was there then—I do not think he could have gone out after he went to bed Cross-examined Q Are you in employ A Yes I was at that time—I was not examined before the Magistrate—I was subpoenaed to attend here—I was asked to go to the police-court but I considered his innocency was so clear that my testimony was not necessary—I think Green bad gone to bed before me—Trumbell must have heard what was going on about the apple-pie bed JAMES CURLING I live at the Model Lodging-house and am a painter out of employ I was examined before the Magistrate On 9th Jan White Brown Green Courtenay and Trumbell supped on bacon and potatoes—White went to bed about half-past twelve o clock and I had made him an apple-pie bed which is the sheets turned up so as to

shirts and a plate with Brettle on it—I was with the officer who found the things in the prisoner s box at his lodging—at the police-station before I found them he cried begged for forgiveness and said if I would not let him be locked up he would return my check-book and all the property he had belonging to me—I have not given him any of these things—the microscope cost about forty guineas Cross-examined by MR MEW Q How often do you go to your ware-house A Sometimes twice a week sometimes once in two months according to arrangement—I take no active part in the business—I have been in it all my life—I have not been on terms of intimacy with the prisoner I placed confidence in him—he lived with me about four years at the Albany—I had a very good character with him from Sir Charles Kent who is now dead—he had to look after the plate and my clothes and to wait at table those were his only duties—I may have sent him on confidential errands—I have often given him letters to give to ladies—I have not to my memory sent him to make appointments with ladies—I do not know a lady named Theobald I did about seven years ago she is dead the prisoner was not with me then—as a servant he has occasionally admitted women there—I never reposed any confidence in him with reference to those matters—I never requested him not to communicate facts which came to his knowledge—I was very often in the habit of having card parties but not on Sunday evenings that I know of—I recollect a Mrs Smith coming to my chambers while the prisoner was there Mr Smith came while she was there—Mrs Smith was not put in a cupboard she was put in an outer room—the prisoner did not have to get her away while Mr Smith was there—this is a system of intimidation which has been pursued towards me to keep me out of Court—I cannot put it upon any person but the fact of Mrs Smith being subpoenaed is sufficient to show it—they thought that now I am married I should be ashamed to face the questions of the prisoner s counsel—I know Mrs Lock she is my housekeeper—she is not here to intimidate me—I have not been intimidating her I have said nothing to her—she told me the prisoner s solicitor had been trying to make her say something which was not true which I communicated to my solicitor—I have trusted the prisoner with 40l or 50l he always accounted accurately till this time—he never gave me notice to leave I gave him notice—I have no recollection of his being desirous to leave me when at the Albany—I never offered him a new suit of clothes and six months wages if he would leave roe—I turned him out of the house about 20th Dec last for gross impertinence to my wife—these are my private check-books I do not Wish you to look inside—I drew checks whenever I had bills to pay—I cannot say whether I ever missed drawing a check for a week without looking over them here are three drawn in one day two on another one on another and two days afterwards another—seven of my check-books were found in the prisoner s box the latest date in them is 25th Oct 1850—I never gave him any check-books to destroy I always keep them under lock and key—I never gave him anything but some old clothes and a 5l note on the day I was married—I have not charged any other person with robbing me—I discharged my coachman because I had reason to believe he robbed me—I never said a Mr Leek robbed me—the prisoner did not ask me to look over his things when he left I did not say They are all right John —the check-books are of great value to me as receipts ROBERT DUNLOP policeman D 133 I took the prisoner at the Chequers in Duke-street—he said he lived at Mr Gibbs s livery-stables Titchfield-street—I told him the charge—be said I have some property at my lodging which was given to me by Mr Brettle at the time I lived with him if you will go with me I will show it —he said I will give you any money if you will let me go —he wanted me to go to Mr Brettle s with him before I took him to the station but I would not—he said For God s sake do allow me to go if I see Mr Brettle be will forgive me —I went to his lodging and found all this property Cross-examined Q Did you make any memorandum of the conversation A No JOHN GIBBS I live at 10 1/2 Titchfield-street The prisoner lived there when he was taken—these things were taken out of his room MR BRETTLE re-examined This microscope pipe breeches and other articles are all mine—I gave none of them to the prisoner Cross-examined Q Did you give the prisoner a box of things belonging to Mrs Theobald shortly before you were married A No I have giren him nothing which belonged to her she never left anything at my house—she never lived with me—she was often in my house—I had many things of hers which I bought at a sale six or seven years ago—this riding-whip has her name on it produced —I did not give it to the prisoner—it is three years since I saw it which convinces me that the prisoner has been keeping up a system of robbery for three years—I wrote three letters to the prisoner accusing him after he left and he came to me two or three times but I would not see him or hold any communication with him GUILTY Aged 26 — Transported for Seven Years There was another indictment against the prisoner Before the Third Jury

iron safe with a great many others—we keep a book with the number and the description of the watches—that book is not here GEORGE CRAGO I am nephew to Mr Cragg On 9th or 10th May 1849 I taw three watches made into a parcel at my uncle s factory—they were for Mr Turner of Ditchley—I took them to Mr Low of 3 Minories and gave them to some person there—it was a brown-paper parcel and addressed Mr Turner Ditchley Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Who was the person from whom you received it A Mr Botten—I saw him do up the watches—there were three—it was on a Wednesday ISAAC FURMER I am manager to Mr Josiah Low a clothier of 3 Minories I recollect a parcel being brought from Mr Cragg s on 9th May—it was a brown-paper parcel not very large—I had seen him that day and sold him a variety of articles thirty-three pairs of trowsers nineteen waist-coats five jackets and five coats—those goods were made up into a truss and the parcel from Mr Cragg s was enclosed in it—it was directed To Mr Edw Turner Ditchley to be left at the Hassock s station —Robert Lynch the porter took it away to the station Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Did you do up the truss yourself A I helped to do it and the porter—I saw Mr Cragg s parcel put in it was a squareish parcel it had the appearance of a box being inside—our house is not far from Rosemary-lane ROBERT LYNCH I assisted in packing a parcel for Mr Turner of Ditchley in May last—I took it to the Dean-street station of the London and Brighton Railway Company—I took my delivery-book with me producing it and the person to whom I gave the parcel gave me this acknowledgment JOHN SMITH On 10th May 1849 I was in the service of the London Brighton and South-Coast Railway at their receiving-house Dean-street Tooley-street—I produce the

the other Mr Turner it my brother I bought some goods of Mr Low of the Minories and ordered them to be sent to me—they did not come—on the same day I purchased some lace net and shawls of Messrs Bridges Gresham-street—I marked them with my own mark and directed them to be sent to Messrs Hinds Milk-street where I was going to buy other articles—I never got them Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Have you any partner A No—I looked out the actual goods at Mr Low s I did not mark them all I marked all I bought at Mr Bridge s JOHN BUTCHER I am in the service of Stephen Bridget of Wood-street In May 1849 he carried on business in Gresham-street—Mr Turner purchased some lace shawls and nets of me—they were tent to Messrs Hinds Milk-street by Charles Reynolds the porter CHARLES REYNOLDS I received a parcel from Batcher and took it to Messrs Hinds Cross-examined by MR PARNBLL Q You find something about it in that book A Yes the entry is Turner Ditchley WILLIAM THOMAS I am packer to Hind Parker and Co of Gresham-street and was so in 1849—I made up a truss containing gloves socks hose and braces it was directed E Turner Ditchley Brighton Railway Hassock s station —I packed with it a parcel I received from Messrs Bridges and took it to the Swan with Two Necks Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Have you any particular recollection of putting into this truss anything which came from Messrs Bridges A I have a memorandum of it which I have referred to ALFRED JINKS I am in the service of Messrs Chaplin and Home—I produce my receiving-book—I find by an entry in my own writing on 10th May 1849 that I received a truss at the Swan with Two Necks from Messrs Hinde Parker and Co for Turner of Ditchley—it was sent by Allen the guard of the South-Coast Railway Company the same day to the Bricklayers Arms station Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Was anything paid upon it A Merely the booking—the carriage was not paid or it would have been inserted in the book RICHARD ALLEM did not appear BARNARD HATTRED On 10th May 1849 I was in the service of the Brighton Railway Company—I received a number of packages from a man named Allen that day—there was one directed to Turner of Ditchley—I saw my man weigh it it weighed 2 cwt 20 lbs Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Do you recollect the direction on the other parcels A No it is a considerable time ago—I recollect this one because I had to answer a report about it next morning from Hassock s-gate—my man weighed the parcels and I checked them with the bill and I recollect making an alteration in it—it was placed about the centre of the truck with three or four others—I did not see it sheeted down there was another truss for Mr Turner there Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Did you see the train go off A No the truck was not standing in a corner it was on the next line to the train which was going off and within a yard of it THOMAS PUNNETT I am employed in the goods department Bricklayers Arms station On the day in question I loaded a truss directed to Turner of Ditchley which came from Dean-street station it weighed 1 cwt 7 lbs —I also loaded in the same truck another truss which came from the Swan with Two Necks weighing 2 cwt 20 lbs —I saw the truck sheeted down and tied with strings—the train started about eleven o clock at night Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Did you see it go off A No I saw it all in readiness nothing had been done to the sheeting then—it would be in the watchman s charge till it started—I last saw it between nine and ten o clock—there is no one here who saw it later JOHN WEST BIGLIN I am station-clerk at Hassock s-gate Railway Station Between six and eight o clock on the morning of 11th May I examined the luggage-truck which came from London—I found by the way-bill that there were two trusses short for Mr Turner Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Did the sheeting appear to have been disturbed A No it was just as usual—it had been there three or four hours when I examined it the guard was not there then—Hassock s-gate is forty-three miles from town—I had charge of the station JOHN CARPENTER police-sergeant R 38 On 15th Feb in consequence of something I went with a man named Owen to a house at Marsh-end Newport Pagnell Buckinghamshire—I saw a person named Griffin in the house—I searched it—I found a great many articles of all descriptions in the shop five pairs of boy s braces seven pairs of men s—they were shown to Mr Thomas—I found two waistcoats in a box which were shown to Furmer—on the following Friday I went to William about two miles and a half from Newport Pagnell and saw Abbott at a house there—I asked him if be knew George Pearson Barrett he said he did—I asked him if he had heard he was in trouble—he said Yes I asked if he had had a letter from him he said he had—I told him I was an officer and he need be very careful what answers he made me as I should have to use them against him in another place—I asked him what goods he had had from Greorge Barrett at different times—he said he had had no goods of him—I asked him if he meant to say he had had nothing from him—he said I had a couple of handkerchiefs and a pair of braces nothing else —I said I must search his house as there were a great many things that had been stolen by Barrett which had not been found—I asked him if he was not a hawker and if he did not carry a pack—he said he was not and he did not carry a pack—I searched a bedroom in his presence and found in a watch-pocket at the head of the bed this watch produced — I opened it turned to Abbott and said This is a stolen watch it is one of three watches stolen out of a truss of goods —he said My brother William who is dead had it of George Barrett his sister who was there said Yes —he said he was sorry for what he had said to me before about not having more things of Barrett that he had told me a lie and if he had known what it was coming to he would not have done it and that he would tell me all the dealings he had had with him—he mentioned about a dozen persons to whom he had sold goods and said he would go with me to them and render me every assistance he could and he was sorry he had not done so in the first instance and that he had sold lengths of cloth tweed gown-pieces and some coats to them—he said Barrett was his brother-in-law that he was not a hawker for he did not dispose of the things he did not take them until he had got an order for them—I asked him if he bad got any license for hawking he said no and he never had one—he said the first thing he ever had of Barrett was about two years ago a box of drapery and he bad continued to have things from him until the present time but not so much lately as he had done before and if be had known how he came by the goods he should have had nothing to do with them—I showed him eight pairs of braces which I bad from Mr Sykes a tailor of Newport Pagnell who said he had made up several pieces of cloth for him and his two brothers-in-law—he said These are part of a dozen of braces which I had of George Barrett —on 25th March I went to Enoch Barrett Gilbert-street Deptford—I saw his wife and then found him in his bedroom getting up—I told him the affair of his brother had become very serious and I had come again to search his house and he must consider himself in custody and must be careful what answers he gave as I should have to use them against him—he turned to his wife and said We had better tell the whole truth about this affair —I searched the bedroom and found these braces and this waistcoat in his clothes-box—in his jacket pocket I found four whistles of different notes—on 24th Feb Abbott was brought to the Greenwich Police-station—he was in there in George Barrett s presence—he said I am brought here about that watch my brother William bad of you —Barrett said There is nothing wrong about that I know —I said Yes he is brought here about a watch and this is it —producing it to him—he said This watch is all right for I bought it of a man at the corner of Rosemary-lane more than two years ago I said it was stolen and belonged to Mr Turner of Ditch ley—he said I don t believe it—I know it is nothing of the sort I bought it honestly —I said Do you know the person you bought it of —he said No it is more than two years ago —I opened it and showed it to him—he said Yes that is the watch —I said It was stolen out of a truss of goods that were sent to the Brighton Railway —I found in George Barrett s house these three pieces of what has been a guard—it is of the same material as this guard on the watch also some wrappers such as are used for packing trusses —one of them has on it Mr Barrett Abbey-end Newport Pagnell Buckinghamshire —in Enoch Barrett s bedroom I found a piece of cloth and a piece of white lace which were spoken to by Mr Butcher—also in a cupboard in the back kitchen this rope which is one of the sheet-cords attached to the trains Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q You give it as your judgment that these two pieces of guard correspond A Yes that they formerly were one guard—this is not now as long as ladies use their guards—I found six dozen of braces at George Barrett s—Mr Thomas only speaks to some of them—his wife kept a little hosiery shop—nobody knew what he was—there were three or four second-hand gowns in the shop Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Was not what Enoch said We had better tell the truth about the things we had of George —A He said that afterwards and the wife directly said she had them for his board and lodging—the things were all of a heap and the two pairs of braces and the waistcoat with them—and he said These are what George brought Cross-examined by MR WOOLLBTT Q Did you take down the conversation in writing A I made a few little memorandums—I have not got them with me—when I first asked him whether he had had any goods of George Barrett he said he had had none—I asked him a second time he then hesitated a moment and said he had had two or three little things—I saw Abbott s two sisters at the house and his father who is the parish-clerk and post-master—I cannot say whether I found the watch in the room of one of the sisters there were women s dresses in all the rooms up-stairs—I took a pair of women s boots from under the bed—I inquired and found Abbott to be a very good character—the Magistrate who is the minister of William said he was never so surprised in his life—William is fifty-eight miles from here JAMES PEDDER I am porter at the Hassock s station I was not there when the train came in on the morning of the 11th—I went there about a quarter-past six—I then went to look over the goods to check them off according to the invoices after doing that I had charge of the truck Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Did you do it at the same time as Mr Biglin A Before somewhere about the same time Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Was there more than one truck left there that morning A No I cannot say how many trusses there were in the truck—I removed the sheeting before Mr Biglin came up—it was only on examining the contents of it that I discovered anything missing—the sheeting and everything was all regular COURT Q When you examined it was the cord of the truck cut A No MATTHEW OWEN I am inspector of police in the service of the South-Eastern Railway Company In Feb last I went to Newport Pagnell and took Carpenter with me—I assisted in searching the house at Marsh-end—I saw Mrs Griffin there—on a drawer at that house I found this card with a portion of lace on it—I also found a box belonging to Pearson of Canterbury and some things relating to a robbery committed at Hailing Pearce and Stones—I found two or three skeleton-keys in a box—I have not got them here Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q How long had George Barrett been in custody when that card was found A I cannot say exactly perhaps a few days I think not a fortnight or three weeks Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q Were you present at the conversation with Abbott A Yes he at first said he had bad no dealings with George Barrett he subsequently said he had had two or three little things HANNAH GRIFFIN I am the wife of Samuel Griffin I know George Pearson Barrett—I know the house the constable searched at Marsh-end—he had never occupied the house his wife occupied it—I have not seen George Barrett there—he lived at Abbey-end but was moving to Marsh-end—his goods were moved Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q How long had he and Mrs Barrett been living at this place A I do not know how long about a year and a half—he kept a little shop for the sale of second-hand clothes hosiery and goods of that description—his friends and relations have always lived there—it is his native place—some of his relations are living there now—I am sure that George Barrett had never been in the house where the card was found—as far as I know he has conducted himself respectably—he lived there before and I lived next-door to him for some time WILLIAM ACTON I am superintendent of police in the service of the London Brighton and South-coast Railway Company Enoch Barrett was in their service as switchman and signal-man—he was so in May 1849—he had been for a long time performing his duty at a junction from the Bricklayers Arms station to the main line—in that position he would have the power of stopping the goods-train at any time he thought right—it would be his duty to see that the line was clear—he would stop a train in the night by putting on a red light and by a red flag in the daytime—goods-trains travel at night—George Barrett is the brother of Enoch—he was also in the Company s employment—he was so part of May but not the whole of it—I cannot say whether he was about the 9th or 10th he was at the beginning and latter part Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q How long has Enoch Barrett been in the Company s employ A I have known him there about five years but he has been longer than that—he had received a gratuity from the Company for good conduct in Jan last—it would be necessary for him to be at his post at the switches when the train was coming out—his hands would be employed and his feet also—there is a guard to the goods-trains an engine-driver and a fireman—I cannot tell who was the guard on that night—I have endeavoured to ascertain but could not—there is not more than one switchman on duty at the same time at that place—a person named George Wood was the other—he is now employed on another part of the line—I cannot say that he was not switchman at that time—if a train is delayed for any considerable time the guard would have to make a report to the station-master—the guard would never leave the train he has charge of—his seat is in the last carriage—he could not command a view of the whole train—I do not know the number of carriages that were in the train that night—I never knew of a goods-train with so little as three carriages or even ten or twenty—the reports were made verbally they could be made to the head manager Mr Hawkins—I heard of the loss of this parcel immediately afterwards—I do not know that any inquiry was made at to who was the guard on the train that night—the first inquiry was in the hands of Carpenter it did not come into my hands till 13th Feb this year Cross-examined by MR WOOLIETT Q You were before the Magistrate A Yes Abbott was let out on bail—I was examined on the last trial—Abbott was then allowed to go out on his own recognizance MR CLARKSON Q The goods-trains generally consist of a vast number of carriages do they not A Yes they are very heavy trains—it would be easy while one man stopped the train for another to take a parcel out—that train sometimes stops at Hay ward s-heath when it has goods for there—if there were no goods for Hayward s-heath it would go right through—there is another short train which takes the intermediate stations MR PARNELL Q How long would it take to undo the tarpaulin remove a truss weighing a hundredweight and re-place the tarpaulin A I think it might be done in two minutes—I think I could do it in less time—there is nothing in the way—the string is cut the corner of the sheet thrown up and it is out in an instant—they do not stop to untie it often—we have had a great many cuts THOMAS PUNNETT re-examined The truck might be left halt-an-hour or not so long after it was fastened up before the trains started as soon as they could get the carriages on—I packed the train that night between nine and ten o clock—it would leave the station about a quarter before eleven—it would remain a very few minutes in the siding because the engine would go in and bring it out at once—there were I should say about forty or fifty trucks that night—50l was about twenty from the engine Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q Have you any recollection of the train that night A No I cannot say how many trucks there were—I cannot say who was the guard—there were two or three one to each train—I cannot say whether there were one or two that night—the sheeting was put on by two men between nine and ten o clock—I did not see it after that till it went—there were not a number of men about only me and Bloxam—other trucks were sheeted—the two men left as soon as they had sheeted the trucks I cannot say what time that was—a man named Copeling had charge of them till they left—he had a horse to run them out of the siding—he is now at the Bricklayers Arms Cross-examined by MR PARNBLL Q What is the furthest point to which this train goes A To Hastings and Portsmouth the Hassock s-gate station would probably be the first at which it would stop—those that stop first are placed next the engine and then detached THOMAS TURNER re-examined This is my watch and the one I sent to Mr Craig s to be mended Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Is there anything particular by which you know it A There is a very particular mark in the dial-plate and the initials F R on the back—when it was shown to me I looked at that to ascertain that it was my watch—it is rather a particular make and I know it by its general appearance—I have not the least doubt it is mine ISAAC FURMER re-examined These three waistcoats produced by Carpenter are the manufacture of Mr Low—two of them have Newport Pagnell marked on them—I have no doubt these are a portion of the waist-coats which I sold to Mr Turner in May—this buff-quilting waistcoat found at Enoch Barrett s is the same description as those I sold—I have no doubt this is the jacket I sold Mr Turner there is a peculiar make about it—we make a great many Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q In May or June 1849 can you say how many of this description of waistcoats might have left Mr Low s shop A I cannot we never had two dozen at any time—there is one in stock now—this might have been sold out of the shop I do not say it was not Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Do you mean to say this is an uncommon pattern those found at George Barrett s A No we have not made thousands of them—one piece would make about three dozen—we have not had above three dozen of that pattern—I have a distinct recollection of the pattern and have no doubt that some of that pattern were included in Mr Turner s parcel—I do not undertake to swear positively that it was made at Mr Low s but to the best of my belief it was from the peculiarity of the make and cut—there is no private mark MR HUDDLESTON Q In the waistcoats you sold to Mr Turner were there three of these patterns A I have no doubt there were similar patterns and similar pieces EDWARD TURNER re-examined Here is my private mark on this card—it it in pencil—I made it at the time I purchased it from Mr Bridges—it is my general practice to do so and I have no doubt I did so then—I am quite sure this mark was made by me—it is a mark of what the article costs—I only bought one other parcel and that I did not mark JOHN BUTCHER re-examined The figure 3 on this card of lace is my writing—I see the joiner s mark five dozen —I am sure that card came from our warehouse I have got the journal here—I find that on 9th May I sold Mr Turner some Paris whisker No 3 at 12 1/2 d —this is the same kind of lace that I sold him on that occasion—I also sold him floss fine quilting of this description—I also sold him a nine eight bobbin net of this description—this was found at Enoch Barrett s—I am sure I sold to Mr Turner goods of this description WILLIAM THOMAS re-examined These five pairs of braces are of the same quality and description as those I sold to Mr Turner I did not sell them but I packed them—a dozen pairs of boys braces were sent of the same quality and description as these three pairs produced—these mens cotton braces are of the same quality as were sent to Mr Turner s—I sent articles of these three descriptions in the same parcel on 9th May—they are of a very common description MR PARNELL submitted that there was no proof of the offence having been committed within the jurisdiction of this Court The RECORDER was of opinion that unless the Jury thought the goods were stolen at the point of junction where Enoch Barrett had charge of the line the Indictment could not be supported JOHN CARPENTER re-examined The junction is about a mile and a btlf from the Bricklayers Arms in the parish of St Paul Deptford on this side of the Grand Junction Canal—I know the bounds of the parish I have walked over them once or twice GEORGE PEARSON BARRETT ENOCH PEARSON BARRETT Transported for Ten Years ROBERT ABBOTT Recommended to mercy— Confined Four Months GUILTY of receiving and witness

28 On the evening of 24th Nov I took the male prisoner in custody and took a parcel and deal box from him which I took to 22 Stacey-street Stepney I believe that is where he lives—I found Ellen Curtis there and Peacock and her husband—I afterwards found that Peacock lived at 110 Brunswick-street Hackney-road—when I took the box to 22 Stacey-street—I said I have brought it from Mr Curtis —I was in plain clothes—one of the females I do not know which said Come in —I went in—I had given Mr Burdett information the day before and he was in the neighbourhood—after I had got into the room Mr Burdett knocked at the door and I then told them I was a policeman and I had taken Curtis to the station—there were two rooms I searched them and found all these articles in one room or the other—I found seventeen pieces of silk varying from eleven to eighteen yards each a piece of terry velvet one piece of bed-furniture four pieces of cloth one piece of merino one umbrella two for riding boas four

2s in the name of Ann Curtis Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Did you ask Mrs Peacock for her address A She was asked when she was charged at the station JAMES YOUNG I am assistant to Messrs Folkard s

pairs of hose pledged on 22nd Nov —they were brought by both the females—I cannot say to whom I gave the money Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Are the greater number of pledges in the name of Ann Curtis A All the 22nd Nov is the only occasion on which I can distinctly recollect seeing the prisoners—it is not unusual for people to pledge in another person s name MR PARNELL Q Are those the tickets pointed out by Smith you gave on the different occasions A Yes GEORGE HENRY PAULIN I am in the employ of Desper and Corner pawnbrokers of the Commercial-road I produce some cambric handkerchiefs pledged as lawn on 16th Oct for 1s by the female prisoners in the name of Ann Curtis—I also produce a piece of calico pledged for 1s on 24th Oct by the two prisoners also four pairs of hose on 29th

them—the things were all quite new—I am sure that Peacock came alone on 24th because I had given information before and took particular notice—I kept her at the shop and sent to the station—it was in consequence of the answer I received that I took in the pledge and let her go Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Have you a distinct recollection of the two females coming A Yes and on one occasion Peacock came alone and gave the name of Ann Curtis Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Do you mean to swear she gave the name of Ann Curtis A Yes COURT Q Were they together when that account was given of the husband being a linendraper A Yes I know now that Curtis s husband is a draper s assistant—she said her husband was living at a wholesale house and he had the things at cost price and she was to do the best she could with them MR PARNELL Q Would the cost price be more or less than what you advanced A Considerably more I should have advanced much more if I had been asked for it—it was that which made me suspect WILLIAM DEAN I am in the service of Mr Asbridge pawnbroker of Mile-end-road I produce a table-cover pledged in the name of Ann Curtis on 24th Nov for 1s by one of the females I cannot say which—they were in the habit of coming together WILLIAM SMITH re-examined I do not find a corresponding duplicate to this of 24th Nov among the forty-four I found or for the calico on 24th Oct —I

mark and all the articles are similar to what I find deficient in my stock—I am quite sure these cambric handkerchiefs produced by the pawnbroker are mine they have my mark and also the diaper—I have a piece of table-cover corresponding to this found in the house—the male prisoner had access to all these articles Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Is yours a wholesale house A No I never sell wholesale—it is not a very large retail house—I keep about twenty hands COURT to GEORGE HENRY PAULIN Q What was the statement the female made A That her husband lived at a wholesale linendraper s ware-house and had the goods at cost-price and she was to do the best she could with them—I do not recollect that she used the word assistant ELLEN CURTIS— GUILTY Aged 22 —Recommended to mercy by the

t18520105-186  186 JOHN MASON and SUSANNAH WALKER stealing 400 yards of silk value 50l and 12 yards of statuette 1l 8s the goods of Charles Spiers and others the masters of Mason in their dwelling-house MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JOSEPH SPIERS I am a silk-manufacturer I carry on business with my father and brother at 10 Spital-square Mason was our foreman for thirteen or fourteen years—he had the management of the work giving it out and receiving it in—he had the general superintendence and down to this time we had confidence in his integrity—on 18th Dec about the middle of the day I bad occasion to go up to the place where Mason had a desk to ask him tone questions about business—he was at his desk and the lid was resting on bis bead—he immediately closed his desk and turned round and I saw he was much confused—I did not intimate to him that I thought there was something irregular but I came down stairs out of the room where he was—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after that he went to dinner—I communicated to my partners what I had observed and I went up to the desk where I and seen Mason—I found the desk locked—Mason had one key of it and we had another—I unlocked it and found in it these eight pieces of silk—they are worth about 52l —they are our property and two or three have tickets on them—we have an engraved form for tickets—I saw this bag in the desk—I locked the desk again and left the silk and bag as I had found it—Mason came sack from his dinner at the usual time and he left at half-past 8 in the evening—my brother is the resident partner there—all the persons had left when the prisoner left he was the last person—after he was gone I went to the desk again and found it open and the silk and bag were gone—I searched about the premises and came to a place we call the wicket-box near the toilet—there is a counter before it that is where the workpeople employed out of doors come to et their work—it is like a box at a pawnbroker s—the workpeople receive and take out their work—we do not have weaving done on our premises—Walker was in our employ s a weaver but she took winding home for some of her family—I found the same bag and silk in that place that I had seen in the desk—I put some marks on the silks and left the bag and silk in the box where I found it—I communicated with the police—next morning I stationed myself with an officer in an empty house which commanded a view of the entrance to our premises—I saw Mason come about 19 minutes past 8—his usual time of coming was 8 but for some considerable time past he had been nearly half-past 8 before he came—in a few minutes after I saw Walker come—I still remained where I was till I saw Walker come out in about ten minutes with this bag and the silk MR BALLANTIKE here intimated that he was anxious on the part of Mason to withdraw his plea but the RECORDER thought the case must proceed When Walker came out I turned to the left and went away I did not want to be seen—I saw Mason that morning again after he was in custody—I afterwards went to where Mason lives in Thomas-street Bethnal-green with the officer—I found there these twelve yards of satinette which I believe h off one of the same pieces that was in the desk—Walker Kves in Church-street she is married Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q Was it about 20 minutes after 8 o clock that morning that Walker came A From a quarter to twenty minutes women come for work at various times—they might come at that hour—I saw two women who work for us go in at our front door at the same time she did—this parcel is a considerable size—the pate is rather narrow where the persons enter for the purpose of being served—all our work is done out of the house—Mason carried on a manufactory of silk gauze at his own place it was carried on with our knowledge—he did no work for us on his own premises—I objected to his having work manufactured on his own premises from the first—Mason s family wove this gauze nothing else I believe—Walker wove for us and the winding was done by some of her family—we have employed her some years I recollect her seven or eight years—Mason had the general management of our business MR BODKIN Q Is this silk perfectly manufactured A One or two pieces are finished the others are unfinished—it is kept in stock sometimes in one state and sometimes another—we had at that time a very large stock—when the weavers bring in their work it is not re-delivered to them to finish unless it is not done well—it is sometimes given them to pick—that was not the case with these I see nothing the matter with them—the weaver s work of these is done—they would be finished by being dressed—Mason lives about a quarter of a mile from Walker THOMAS KELLY police-sergeant H 2 I was spoken to on this matter and on the morning of 19th Dec I was in a room nearly opposite the prosecutor s premises—I saw Mason go in and shortly after Walker went in and two other women—I then saw Walker come out with this bag and turn to the left and before I could get down I lost sight of her—I found her in the Pewter Platter about 100 yards off—she was sitting down in front of the bar and this bag by her side I was in plain clothes—I stopped some time and then I said to her What have you got in that bag —she looked at me and in about a second she said That is like your impudence —I then told her I was a police-sergeant and I suspected she had stolen property and she must come with me—she then said it was her work—I took her into custody and took possession of the bag—it contained the silk now produced—I took her back to the warehouse and as we were going along she told no the foreman had given it her to take home to her house till he called for it—when I got to the premises I sent for Mason and told him he was charged with stealing a quantity of silk the property of his employers—he asked us to let him go back for his hat but not knowing the premises and whether there might be a back way out I refused to let him go—he then said You know too much for me —Walker was there at the time—Mason said something to his master and he cried and said he did not know what made him do it and he said she was not the guilty party—he cried all the way to the station-house Cross-examined Q Did he say also J gave it to her A Yes he said that in the warehouse and he said She is not the guilty party —it fact part of the time he did not know what he did say—Mason s house is about a quarter of a mile further than Walker s house if you go round Church-street but if you go from the warehouse it is about the same distance—in going from the warehouse to Mason s it would be rather out of the way to go to Walker s but not much MR BODKIN Q Did you search Walker s house A I did I found this piece of velvet this piece of silk and some silk not manufactured—these are them CHARLES SPIERS JUN I am one of the partners in the firm A communication was made to me—I went up after the people had gone and saw the silk—on the following morning I placed myself in a room adjoining the weavers waiting-place—I went there about half-past 7 o clock—I had A view of the wicket-box—I saw Walker come there two women and a little boy had been disposed of before her—Mason was attending to business at that counter—after the other two women and the boy were gone and Walker was there alone I beard some conversation between her and Mason—I put my ear to the keyhole and could hear a low sort of whispering but could not distinguish the words—I saw Walker come out of the box with this white bag—when she was brought back by the officer I called Mason and told him we wanted him there was an officer to take him into custody for robbing us—he merely said Oh as he walked out of the warehouse that was all—I afterwards saw him and Walker in the passage—I heard Walker say she knew nothing at all of it—the bag was given to her—Mason then said she was not the guilty party or the guilty one JOSEPH SPIERS re-examined This velvet found at Walker s is not ours—this silk looks very much like ours I could not swear to it—here is a bobbin with some silk on it—this bobbin is ours—she could not honestly be in possession of this bobbin—every bobbin ought to be returned—I could not swear to this unwound silk Cross-examined Q Is this what is used in weaving A Yes but if this bobbin was given out to wind it should be returned—our account is kept by weight—we weigh the silk out and weigh the bobbins—this would be in the control of Mason—I do not know whether she was bound to return this bobbin John Peters a publican John Mew publican Charles Gold oilman Edward Cull publican John Kelly builder and George Ford gave Mason a good character

am at present a convict under sentence of transportation for life that is under a conviction for uttering a forged bankers cheque—I am one of the persons by whom a robbery of gold was effected in May 1855 on the South Eastern Railway Company—I know the three prisoners—I have known Pierce I should think about five years it might be more—he was not in the employment of the South Eastern Railway Company when I knew him—I have known Burgess between three and four years—I knew him employed as one of the guards of that company—I have known Tester I think somewhere about the same time—he was in the employment of the company in the superintendent of traffic s office Q When did you first have any conversation with either of the prisoners upon the subject of this robbery A The first time I had any conversation was with Pierce about four years since I should think—I had been to the United States of America—I saw Pierce upon this robbery after my return but I knew him previously to going—when I returned he was a clerk at Clipstone s betting office in King—street Covent-garden—I met him in King-street accidentally—I had conversation with Pierce on the subject of this robbery before I went to America it was then proposed to commit the robbery provided we could and I declined it—I did not think it was practicable to be done—I then left and went to America and when I returned I met Pierce accidentally he asked me if I thought anything more about the robbery I said I thought it was impossible to be done unless an impression of the keys could be got—he said he thought he could get them if I would undertake it—I had several meetings with Pierce after that the conversation was generally how to obtain possession of these keys—upon his telling me he thought he could procure impressions of the keys I said if he could do so I would have no objection to undertake to complete the robbery—the matter was then left—he said he would endeavour to see Tester and when he did he would let me know—Tester and Burgess were the two names he mentioned as being connected at that time Q How was that stated in answer to any question of yours or how A Merely stating was he sure he could get the impression it was no use my waiting if he could not and he said No doubt in course of time he could do so that was the conversation that passed Q Was anything said about how many persons were to be concerned in it A Yes four three besides myself—that was in answer to a question of mine—I asked him if he could get the impressions how many parties would be connected with it he said there would be four naming Tester Burgess himself and myself—this was the subject of conversation several times when I met Pierce—this was about four years ago when I first came back from America—I went down to Folkestone about twelve months before the robbery—in the interval I had seen Burgess—I had seen Pierce several times—I had seen Burgess but Tester I had not seen up to that time although I knew him—I had not seen him about this robbery—before I went to Folkestone I had conversation about the robbery at which Burgess was present and also with Tester before I went to Folkestone—I could not state the number of times I had seen Burgess before I went to Folke-stone it was so many—I used to meet him at Sterne s being the usual house he went to and I have seen him at his own house—on those occasions when Burgess has been present I did not see Tester—I had seen Tester before I went down to Folkestone—I saw him at Margate he was station master there I went down there to see him—when Burgess was present with Pierce and myself the conversation was that Pierce had communicated with Tester because he had more control over Tester than I had—Pierce stated to me that Tester was at Margate and wished to see me that he could show me the impression of the cash box if that would be any criterion for me to go by to make the keys for the bullion chest—I went down to Margate and saw Tester—I went with him to his lodging took some tea with him and I stopped there that night and returned to London in the morning—he showed me the iron safe that was in the office at Margate and in the morning he showed me the key belonging to a cash box that comes up the line with the money for the different stations and he asked me if that would be any guide for me to make the keys of the bullion chest by—I said not the least—he said it was a great pity that Pierce had not named it to him before for when he was clerk at the harbour office at Folkestone he had the keys in his possession and that induced me and Pierce to go down to Folkestone—I should say as near as my memory will permit that it was about six or seven months after seeing Tester at Margate that Pierce and I first went to Folkestone—when I returned from Margate I saw Pierce I saw Burgess I believe at night or when his train came in—I went round and saw him and communicated to him what my opinion was upon what reports Tester had made to me at Margate—they asked my opinion upon it and I said the only thing would be to go down to Folkestone take an apartment and stop there and watch the tidal trains in and out and see if the keys were there according to the report that Tester had given—it was arranged that that should be done—I and Pierce then went to Folkestone—that was about a year before the robbery and about six months after the conversation with Tester at Margate—Pierce and I hired two bed rooms and a sitting room at Folkestone—I do not know the name of the house it was on the right hand side going from the up station towards the town—I went by the name of Adams there—I do not know the name that Pierce went by—I do not know whether he gave any name or not—I took the apartments in the presence of Pierce—I should think we stopped at Folkestone probably a fortnight—I could not say the time exactly—we stopped there till Pierce was driven away by the inspector of police—we used to go down to the harbour on the arrival of the train from London and the boat from Boulogne watch the iron safe and see whether they unlocked it or what was done—we did not succeed in seeing them for some time and by being down there so often the police took notice of us—the inspector at Folkestone followed Pierce—I told him that he was looking after him—I supposed he thought he was there for picking pockets or something of that and Pierce took him through the town and got away from him in some way and went to the lodging I went to the lodging to have my tea and met Pierce there—in consequence of that Pierce came up to London that same day leaving me there—I either remained a week or stopped till the week was up I cannot say which—I noticed on one occasion the way in which the safe that brought the bullion was—before Pierce left we noticed generally the way in which it came—we were always there to notice whether the bullion safe was opened or not—we had not seen it opened COURT Q You said you saw it opened on one occasion A Yes on one occasion which I will mention MR BODKIN Q Was that on the occasion of a parcel coming A No it was before Pierce came up a chest was going to be sent up to London empty it was placed on the platform and a man named Sharman I believe a ticket porter came out to lock the chest and he used one key and there was another key suspended which I supposed was the key of the other lock—I saw that done and when he had locked it I followed him into the office to see where he put the keys and he put them into the cash till a drawer under the desk that is at the office where the tickets are distributed at the harbour station—when I came up to London I saw Pierce and Burgess—during the time I remained at Folkestone after Pierce had left I frequented a house there kept by a man of the name of Meadows or some such name in the upper part of the town—Chapman and Ledger the two clerks used to go there and I used to go there to play at billiards with them—I did not succeed in getting any information from them—they gave me no facility whatever in the object I had in view—Pierce was living in Walnut-tree-walk Lambeth at this time—I mentioned to Pierce what had happened at Folkestone during his absence—I named to him that I had been down there seeing the trains in and the policeman was always there looking for him—I stated to him that I thought we should be able to get the impressions provided I had an introduction to one of the men of the name of Sharman I think it was but being a stranger I could not make myself acquainted with him—it was then arranged Pierce made the arrangement that he should see Tester and make an appointment for Tester to meet me at Folkestone and introduce me to this Sharman to walk about the station with me—Pierce met Tester and made the arrangement to meet me there—I did not see him meet Tester—he told me that he had done so and I was to go down to Folkestone and stop there and Tester was to meet me there as it were by accident—I went down alone—I should think that was something like eight or nine months previous to the robbery—I cannot speak correctly to dates—I stopped at the Pavilion Hotel that time—I only remained there two or three days to the best of my recollection—I saw Tester at the up station on the Sunday and we walked together down to the harbour station and walked about—when I met him he merely asked me how I was and such like or if the parties were there—I said I had seen them but I could not introduce myself to them—he said I will make it all right for you —we walked arm in arm together down to the harbour station and went into the office—he showed me about the office and the telegraph and such like and there we saw the man named Sharman the ticket clerk—Tester introduced me to Sharman as a friend of mine stopping here for some little time —when he introduced me to Sharman it was proposed that we should go to the Pavilion to have a glass of wine—Sharman consented and brought a friend with him—Sharman his friend and me and Tester went into the Pavilion—I called for some sherry and biscuits which we partook of—Tester and Sharman were in conversation about how business was going on there whether they had much bullion crossing and such like the principal of the conversation was between Tester and Sharman I merely sat there as any other person—I believe Sharman to be the name of the man the ticket clerk or something similar to that name—Tester dined with me that day at Folkestone—it was on a Sunday I do not know the date—no one but Tester dined with me Q Was anything then said about this robbery A He asked me what my opinion was I said I thought it was very likely as I had had an introduction to Sharman I might go with him at the time he was issuing out tickets and get an impression of the keys—Tester came up to London on that same day—I stopped at Folkestone—I used to take a walk on to the beach or round about to pass away my time—I generally endeavoured to throw myself in the way of Sharman but he was a very sedate young man—I could not get further than the time of day with him I could not get at all intimate with him—I did not see anything more of the chest or the place where the keys were kept—finding that I could not get any way familiar with Sharman I came up to London—I saw Burgess and Pierce—I told them that I could not make any impression with this Sharman on account of his being so sedate but we would let it remain a little while and we would go down again when the police had forgotten Pierce which was consented to—during this time the key of the bullion chest was lost—Pierce communicated it to me—he told me that he had received a letter from Tester stating that one of the keys was lost and the bullion chest would have to come up to Mr Chubb s to be repaired—after Pierce had made this statement to me he stated that Tester had told him he expected the box up and to let him have some wax to take the impression—I objected to that—I said No I must take the impression myself —he saw Tester and communicated that to him and then the arrangement was made between Pierce and Tester for me to be at the arcade —near the terminus at a given hour of the day and if he had the key he would let me take the impression—I went there accordingly and met Tester—he stated that he had not got the key then—I met him the next day and the same took place for two or three days or more—eventually I told him that I did not like standing under the arcade so much and an appointment was then made to be at a beer shop at the corner of Tooley-street kept by a man named Waller or some such name Wallis—I went there and met Tester and Pierce—Tester produced two keys they were new keys of Chubb s make—I told him that I must take one of them up stairs for a few minutes at which he rather hesitated for a moment he said could not I do it there —I said I should prefer going up stairs—I rang the bell and asked the waiter if I could go up stairs and wash my hands—he called the chamber maid and she showed me up into a bed room and I there took the impression of one of the keys both keys were alike—I should say they were both for one lock they were duplicate keys—I took two or three impressions on some wax—I then came down stairs and returned the keys to Tester and he went away and I and Pierce went Q At this time were you in the habit of see Burgess A Yes we were in the habit of meeting Burgess we always knew what train Burgess was upon and if we had not any appointment made with him we used to go to Sterne s and meet and when he came in if we had anything particular to talk about we used to go out into the dark—Sterne kept a public house in Tooley-street or a turning into Tooley-street frequented by the servants of the company—I saw Burgess after taking the impressions of the key I stated to him that we had one that was half way but the one was very little use without the other—the first time of my going to Sterne s beer shop was with Pierce I met him there several times afterwards—I and Pierce and Burgess talked the matter over how we could obtain the second key—it was proposed that I should go down to Folkestone and stop at the Pavilion Hotel and Pierce was to send a letter to me in the name of Archer stating that he would forward a box to me containing 600l or 700l —I was possessed of money at that time I advanced I think between 200l and 300l for that purpose in sovereigns—I went down to Folkestone on a Saturday and stopped at the Pavilion—I received a letter from Pierce through the post—I destroyed that letter it stated that he would forward a box down to me in the care of either Ledger or Chapman—I do not know which and that he had insured it to the value of 600l or 700l I forget which—it was to be sent in a small box to be insured at the London terminus in the usual way and directed for E A Archer to the care of one or other of those persons at the Folkestone station—I received the letter on the Saturday—I went to the office in the harbour produced the letter to Chapman or Ledger I do not remember rightly which it was that was in the office and asked them if they had a box for me—they said it had not then arrived and I told them I was stopping at the Pavilion if one should arrive—I inquired again on the Sunday it had then arrived—I went to the upper station to see the train arrive and the iron chest put out—it was taken out in the ordinary way—it was then forwarded to the lower station—I walked down to the lower station and showed my letter to Chapman Chapman stated that he believed he had got the box for me—I saw Chapman open the safe—he only used one key—there were two locks on the safe but by unlocking one the safe opened there was only one key used at that time—I noticed that he took that key from a cupboard at the back of the office on the left hand going in—he took the box out and told me I must sign a form for the receipt of it—I told him that I was not able to do so as I had met with an accident and hurt my finger and I would trouble him to do it for me and he did so he filled it up for me and said I must get you to sign it and I signed it in the name of E R Archer looking at a paper —this signature is my writing the other part is in Chapman s— read South Eastern Railway—Specie and Finance Way Bill London to Folkestone Oct 30th 1854 received the under—mentioned case in iron chest J Burgess guard—address and destination Ledger—of whom received Wilkins Basinghall-street—character of contents gold and silver—value insured 300l —signed Weatherhead S M —package addressed Archer Pavilion Hotel Folkestone—Received the above C J Chapman harbour master Folkestone—Received the above E R Archer owner —having obtained the parcel I went with it to the Pavilion Hotel and asked the porter for a knife opened it and took out the bag of gold—I believe the sovereigns that I gave to Pierce to put in that box were got from the Bank of England but I am not quite positive of that—I came up from Folkestone I believe that same night I then had an interview with Pierce I communicated to him where the key was kept and it was agreed that Pierce and I should go down to Dover—I also saw Burgess after my return—I stated to him where the key was kept—Pierce and I did go to Dover about a week after the receipt of the box—I cannot say at what time we arrived there it was about mid-day—we stopped at the Rose a commercial house just by the market place opposite the church—we did not stop at the Rose a very long while—we walked over the hills to Folkestone the same day by the sea coast—I cannot state the time exactly that we got there—we went there to watch the arrival of the boat from Boulogne—we waited till she came in and went down to the harbour—I noticed that Ledger and Chapman generally when the boat arrived left their office and went out to search the passenger s luggage—when the boat arrived we were down on the harbour and we saw Chapman and Ledger leave the office—I and Pierce went to the door of the harbour master s office where the clerks kept the key—I stood at the door—there is only one door—it is facing the water—Pierce went in to the cupboard and brought the key to me—I took the impression of it and gave it to him back and he put it into the cupboard again—the door of the office was on the latch not locked—I cannot say whether the cupboard from which Pierce took the key was locked but I supposed it was not or he would not be able to get the key—I did not take any notice of the cupboard door I was looking to see that Chapman did not come back—we returned to Dover the same day and had our tea at the Rose and after tea we returned to London by the train—after I had obtained the impression of the second key I met Burgess in London and communicated to him the success we had met with in getting the second key and we said that it was a very good job we should be able to complete the robbery and he said that he would do all that lay in his power to do so—he lived at New-cross at that time—there is a house near there called the Marquis of Granby parting the road from Lewisham to Greenwich—I met him there on one or two occasions—Pierce was with me and I think Tester but I will not be sure—I met Burgess there several times—I next proceeded to make keys for the bullion chest from the impressions—as I had not the convenience to make them at Pierce s house I and Miss Kay made up our altercation that we had and I got the keys made at Cambridge villas—I finished them myself—I filed the blanks to the impression—at this time Pierce lived at Walnut-tree-walk—I began the filing in an empty room over the gateway in his house—there was a difference between me and Fanny Kay—she was living in Harleyford-road Vauxhall and I used to go backwards and forwards there—she was living as my wife—I had had a child by her—we made up our difference and I took a house at Cambridge-villas and she went to live with me—it was there that I went on finishing the keys—Pierce at that time lived at Walnut-tree-walk and from there he removed to Crown-terrace or Crown-place Hampstead-road—I cannot rightly state the time I had been at Cambridge-villas before Pierce removed to Crown-terrace—after he removed there he was in the habit of coming to Cambridge-villas—he assisted me to remove there from Harleyford-road—he was at Cambridge-villas and assisted me to make a file and any little thing I wanted him to do he did—we used to do that in the wash house adjoining the garden—the tools I used were files and a hammer and chisel whitesmith s tools—they were my tools and were kept in a wooden box painted green and also in a small wainscot box—these are them produced and here are some of my took—here are two in particular which I know—while the filing was going on and after the keys were finished an arrangement was made between me and Burgess and Pierce to go down and try them with the safe—we used to communicate to Tester as we proceeded what progress we had made—I was to go down with Burgess and if he had the chest to try them—I went down seven or eight times to try them I travelled by the train as a second or a first class passenger and if he had got the chest I used to get into the van and try the keys at Reigate or any other place—I tried them five or six times and altered them if they did not fit and they at last opened it—Burgess was always the guard I never tried them except when he was guard he saw me open it—after I had succeeded I met Pierce and Tester at Burgess s house often and it was stated to him that the safe was all ready and that they were waiting till Burgess got on to the mail train—the tidal train is the train by which bullion is generally sent but at certain times it would go by the mail train any bullion that came after the tidal train had gone was sent on by the mail—it was the mail train that was robbed—we had a meeting at Burgess s to state what was to be done with the property and how we were to go down to complete the robbery—I can speak to Burgess Pierce and myself being present—it was 12 000l worth of gold we thought and we were to get shot to make that weight—we calculated that the 12 000l worth of gold would weigh about two cwt —12 000l was spoken of as we thought that would be as much as me and Pierce would be able to carry—I and Pierce went to the shot tower over by the Suspension-bridge—Pierce went and bought one cwt placed it in two small carpet bags and brought it to the gate he had one and I had the other we walked across the Suspension-bridge got on an omnibus and took the shot to Cambridge-villas—Pierce repeated the visit to the shot tower and bought 50 lbs twice again making two half cwts —I did not go the second time or the third time I only went once and he bought the half cwts at two different times—the bags were at first placed in the parlour and afterwards they were taken out of the canvas bags in which they were and placed in my trunk they were brought in canvas bags—we afterwards weighed it into 8 lbs and 4 lbs parcels and they were placed in some blue check bags—Fanny Kay was at home when I arrived and a servant named Charlotte Paynter—they were the only persons except my child who lived in that house—my trunk was in the first floor bed room the house consists of two rooms on the ground floor and three on the first floor there are no rooms above the first floor—the room I speak of was that in which I and Fanny Kay slept—the trunk always remained there until I came away but the shot was taken from there and placed in the wash-house in this box the one produced for the convenience of weighing it into 8 lbs and 4 lbs parcels—I do not think Fanny Kay had any opportunity of seeing us put the shot up in parcels if she had opened the box she would have seen it but I do not think she had curiosity enough to do so at times it was open and at times it was locked—I had the key—after that had been done we had about 10 lbs or 12 lbs of shot more than we required and me and Pierce carried it out in our pockets and distributed it in the fields and the road in the neighbourhood of Pierce s house in Crown-terrace—we then had four leather courier bags made with a strap to sling over the shoulder and go under the arm—Pierce and me ordered them together at the corner of Drury-lane and Queen-street—we fetched them and then tested them we carried them with the shot to Cambridge-villas and in so doing a few of the stitches came undone—I made some wax ends and sewed them up at my place—they were made of drab leather—they had such a strap as this round this box but this is not one of them—the shot was removed to Pierce s house Crown-terrace in carpet bags by a cart and horse which Pierce got—the courier bags were placed inside the carpet bags with the shot—one bag a black leather one was made on purpose for Tester I had it made for him we four met together and asked Tester to come down to Reigate and take part of the gold up which would lighten our load on his return to London—he consented and I got that bag made for him and placed it in the carpet bag with the others—the shot was in the bag and all these arrangements made at Pierce s house—I first saw that bag about a month or two before the robbery took place I cannot speak accurately—all was then in readiness for the robbery—when Burgess got on the mail train an arrangement was made that me Pierce Tester and Burgess should meet at London-bridge on certain days which were picked out from the list of tidal trains I am speaking now of the time when Burgess was on the tidal train and I and Pierce went to St Thomas s-street in the Borough in a cab with the carpet bag and the tools for breaking open the boxes—we hired the cab either at the cab stand by Chalk-farm or by the Red Cap—we did not go from Pierce s house we walked a little way to the cab—Pierce had on a black wig and whiskers and a cloak—he carried the two courier bags one on each side and a carpet bug in his hand and I had a cloak and two courier bags and a carpet bag containing the shot—that was the first occasion—we drove to St Thomas s-street near the hospital—I got out and left Burgess in the cab—I took my courier bag off and my cloak—I walked according to appointment and met Tester who stated that there was none going down that night—we repeated that for five or six nights I will not say exactly but as many as that—Tester was the man that I generally used to see—I saw Burgess on one occasion—on all those occasions we found that the bullion chest was not going down and we went back to the neighbourhood of Crown-terrace and then carried the bags—when Tester came to the cab he had a conversation with Pierce at the window general conversation about the robbery but what the words were I cannot tax my memory with now I learned while out that the bullion chest was not going down and then he would come and have a conversation with Pierce who was in the cab—I remember on one occasion being at a coffee shop in College-street not on the night of the robbery that was by the turnpike gate but previous to that Pierce carried the large bag over his shoulder to a coffee house near the Eagle in Camden-town left me there with my two courier bags and carpet bag while he went home to make himself up with his wig and bring the other things out and he brought a cab and we went together to London-bridge—on the night of the robbery we were in a coffee house in High-street Camden-town near the Southampton Arms near the turnpike gate—we walked there and I and Pierce went in and had our tea and Pierce left the bag with the two large carpet bags and the two courier bags and after some time he returned with a cab—I lifted the large bag in and we drove to St Thomas s-street—we had each the two courier bags and when we reached there I got out and went to the station as usual and Burgess came out and wiped his face which was the signal agreed upon that the chest was going down—he was at the gate of the station where carriages drive in I do not know the name of it—he then went to his train and I went to St Thomas s-street and found Pierce where I had left him—I got into the cab and told the cab man to drive to the Dover station—while he was driving to the station I placed the two courier bags on and the cloak—I saw Tester between the outer station and the incline—he said in a hurried voice All right and went towards the office to get his ticket as I judged—I went and got two first class tickets and gave the two carpet bags to the porter telling him that they were for Dover and to wait till I came—I kept on my courier bags—I gave one of the first class tickets to Pierce and went on to the platform—Pierce got into a first class carriage and I walked to the guard s box saw the carpet bags and said they were for Dover—they were given to Burgess and he put them into his van—the small leather bag was inside one of the large bags—it was within a few minutes of the time for the train to start—I then walked on and when Mr Weatherhead the superintendent s back was turned I got in at one of these small doors pointing to a model of the van where there is a break generally—it is the guard s place—that is where the bags were put—I got into a corner and Burgess threw his apron over me while he took the baggage in—I saw the luggage in previous to my getting in—this inner door that slides was open when I got in—Burgess closed it after the train started COURT Q Were you in the receptacle for luggage till the train started A Yes in the receptacle for the guard MR BODKIN How long did you remain there A Five or ten minutes but the time passed very long being in that position—after the train started I got up and got in here where I found the two iron safes—I went into the luggage compartment as soon as the train started—I opened the iron safe and took out one of the boxes—this is one of the boxes produced it was fastened by these iron bands and nails through the head and it was sealed—I had a pair of pincers to raise the iron and box wood wedges to raise the wood part with a mallet—upon wing those things I opened the box without much difficulty—I found in the box bars of gold—I took out the bars of gold I think it was four that were in that box I would not speak to the number I believe it to be four—I placed one of them in the black bag for Tester to take and gave it to Burgess—Burgess placed it for Tester to take as was arranged previously—the others I packed up in the carpet bags that we had and fastened up the box and replaced it in the iron safe—I put into the box these bags of shot four pounds and eight pounds—they are the bags of which I have spoken done up in the blue check—Burgess placed the black bag for Tester in the front part where he stood the guard s department—we had arrived at Reigate by this time the train stopped there—I was then in the baggage department Q Did you see whilst the train was at Reigate what became of the black bag A I do not know what became of it further than I gave it to Burgess and I heard Tester s voice and I saw no more of it till the next morning—Tester said Where is it where is it COURT Q Am I to understand that you heard Tester s voice in the van A At the door—I do not know what part I was in the back part there pointing to the model but I heard his voice MR BODKIN Q You did not see him at all A I did not—I cannot say what time it was when we got to Reigate—Pierce then got in and joined me in the baggage department—we then opened the same iron safe that the box was in there was another small box containing American gold coin—I opened that and took the coin out I do not know the amount of that—we took the bag of coin out and placed shot in screwed it down again placed the seal on the box and put it in the safe again—I saw those boxes yesterday in one of the courts here—I screwed the second box down with screws the other I fastened with iron hoops—we had got some steel seals that had been purchased previously with initials on—I do not know the initials—we melted the wax by a small wax taper and resealed them—the smaller box containing the American gold coin was opened in the presence of Pierce—I then placed them in the iron safe and locked the iron safe and then opened the second iron safe which contained one box we opened that box in the same manner as I have previously stated—that contained small bars of gold—we took some of that out as much as we thought we had shot to replace placed the shot in and fastened it up in the same way—the train proceeded on to Folkestone I and Pierce went on to Dover—the shot we used was not all of one size it was two different sizes one smaller than the other—the gold was placed in the courier bags and the carpet bags—when we got to Dover I took one carpet bag Pierce took the other having the courier bags on us—we walked out of the station to an hotel I think it was the Dover Castle—Mrs Divers or some such name—I am not positive whether I got out of the train at Folkestone or whether I rode in the guard s box but Pierce had got out previously and taken his seat in a first class carriage with the courier bag upon him—I am not positive whether I was in the guard s box or in a first class carriage when I arrived at Dover—I think I was in a first class carriage but I will not speak positively on that point—the carpet bags were in the luggage department the guard s van—I believe the train was due at Dover about 11 o clock at night—when we went to this house we walked into the coffee room and placed the bags under the window in one corner and ordered supper—while the waiter was gone to get the supper we took the courier bags off and placed them down in the corner—the waiter inquired if we wanted beds I told him no we had driven in and were going up by the mail train—the mail train leaves Dover at 2 o clock in the morning—after supper I took the tools that I had used the mallet chisels and that to the pier and threw them away to lighten our load I returned back again Pierce was left in the room—we paid our bill and then asked the waiter to put us a little brandy up in a soda water bottle and a few cigars—while he was gone for it we replaced our courier bags on our shoulders—he brought us the brandy in the soda water bottle and the cigars I then took one bag and Pierce the other and we walked to the station—we did not take tickets for London the porter met me at the gate and wanted to take the bag he very politely said he would carry it—I objected to his doing so he offered to take it out of my hand—he asked if we had tickets—I said we had two coupons from the Ostend line—we had two Ostend tickets—Pierce had obtained them previous to starting from London—they were blue tickets—I do not know whether I had them at Dover or whether Pierce had them or whether we had one each—the porter asked me to show our luggage—I showed them and he said there had been no baggage through the Custom House that day from Ostend I at the same time put my hand in my pocket where I had a little trifling silver a few shillings I put them in his hand and said No we got them through yesterday and he passed away and left us—no further inquiries were made—we came up in a first class carriage—no one was in the carriage but ourselves—Burgess was guard of that train—I did not notice how many passengers came up by that train there were not a very great many but I did not notice particularly there were not a very great many not at starting—as we came along the line we opened the large bags and distributed the hay threw it away—when the train stopped at one of the stations I do not know the name of it Pierce got out took the two large carpet bags and left them in the waiting room—they were then empty we had thrown the hay away as we came along—the gold and the coin were then in two small carpet bags that had been inside the large ones and in the courier bags—the train arrived at the London bridge station at it s usual time in the morning I do not remember the exact time I think 5 o clock was the time it was due but I am not positive—I and Pierce got it and walked down the station carrying the small bags in our hands and the courier bags on us under our cloaks when we got outside the gate we took a cab and told the cab man to drive to the Great Western—when we got near the Great Western we told the cab man that he was making a mistake that we wanted to go to Euston-square and he drove us to Euston-square—we got out and went to a public house that was open and went into the parlour—we discharged the cab and stayed there some little time—Pierce then went and fetched another cab and we drove to the neighbourhood of Crown-terrace—we discharged the cab and carried the bags to Pierce s house—we left the gold at Pierce s house came out and took a cab and drove down to London-bridge—we took the American coin with us—we discharged the cab and I went and met Tester to receive the bar of gold that he had had the night before—that was the arrangement that was made that I should meet him there—Tester gave me the bar of gold—I took it from him and he went to his office I believe—I and Pierce took a cab and drove to Leadenhall-street down by the side of the East India House—Pierce got out and went to a money changer s at the corner of St Mary Axe and there he sold part of the American coin—I remained in the cab with the bar of gold—when Pierce returned to the cab he told me he had got upwards of 200l for the American coin but I do not know the full amount—he stated that they wanted to pay him in a cheque and he refused that and wanted English gold he said they told him that if he would wait a bit they would send their man to the banker s for it which he did according to the report he gave me and he brought English gold for it we then drove to the Haymarket to a money changer s on the right hand side of the way going from Pall Mall nearly at the top—I do not know the name—Pierce went out and sold there some more of the American coin upwards of 200l worth—that was the whole that remained of what we had brought out—they paid him with a cheque on the Union Bank Pall Mall—I went there and presented it and received 200l in gold for it—I had the money in my possession in the cab but when we got back to Pierce s house he had it—we drove back to Pierce s house at least we did not drive up to the door we got out in the neighbourhood—Pierce had the money the proceeds of the sale of the American coin—I was not at all in want of money at that time—Pierce had no money he was supporting himself by pledging his things and what money I lent him he was in destitute circumstances—when we arrived at Pierce s house Pierce went and hired a cart as he told me in Grove-street at all events he brought a cart and horse we placed the bag containing the gold in it and drove to my place at Cambridge-villas—I and Pierce went with the cart the courier bags were placed in the carpet bags and we carried them in the cart to Cambridge-villas—Fanny Kay was at home when we arrived there—the bags were put first in the front parlour and then I took them up stairs and placed them in my trunk that was in the bed room the same trunk in which I had kept the shot it was an American made trunk—Pierce did not go up stairs he took the horse and cart back again—I did not see anything more of him that day—I saw him again it must have been the next day or a day or two after I could not say rightly now it was very soon afterwards—I did not see either of the other prisoners for some time afterwards—when I did see Pierce it was at my own house he called upon me Q What did you proceed to do with the gold A There was 100 ounces cut off at first Pierce was there at the time it was cut off and he sold it for 3l per ounce—that was very shortly after the robbery—he did not bring back the money for it he accounted for it I do not know whether he took it to the bank and got notes for it or whether he kept it for some time I had the money it wag 300l —it was then arranged that we should make a furnace and melt the gold—Pierce consented to bring some fire bricks to make the furnace of—I pulled the common stove out of the first floor back room at Cambridge-villas and there erected the furnace with the assistance of Pierce—Pierce brought the stones in a horse and cart— some stems were here produced —that is one of them I know it by this hole it was chipped out on purpose to cause a draught stronger through the furnace—I see here a piece of gold now sticking to it—having erected the furnace we procured some crucibles and an ingot to run the gold in in melting to put the gold in another form to east it into long ingots of 100 oz we had a pair of scales and weights—Pierce bought some of the crucibles and I bought some—we proceeded to cut the gold bars 100 oz off at a time melted them in the furnace and poured them into the ingot—we melted them in the crucibles by charcoal and coke—it requires very great heat to melt gold—on one occasion when I was taking one of the crucibles out of the furnace it broke and the gold scattered over the floor and burnt the flooring—nobody came into the room besides me and Pierce while we were so engaged—Miss Kay brought some bitter ale to the door once or twice but we would not allow her to come in—she said You seem very hot what are you about you seem all in a perspiration —I made some frivolous answer that it was nothing concerning her or something to that effect and shut the door—I do not remember anything being said about aprons—we cut up the courier bags and part was used as a defender to prevent the fire from burning my hands those we burnt and a part were kept to make a covering for one of my trunks to defend it the rest was burnt— looking at two pieces of leather these are part of them—that is where it was burnt by the fire—it took me three or four days to melt the gold—the heat was so great we were obliged to put the fire out for fear of setting fire to the chimney—Pierce remained with me all day on those days—he had his meals with me—on the first day Fanny Kay went to see the child it was out at nurse at that time then there was no one in the house but me and Pierce we sent her away on purpose—she was at home when the bricks were brought—they were brought in a cart in a canvas bag I think or covered over with something—I think Pierce brought some cement or some charcoal on the day Fanny Kay went to see the child—they were things that were to be used in the melting and which we could not procure in the neighbourhood—Pierce went home of a night to sleep Q After you had melted the whole of the gold and got it into this new shape of the ingot what did you next do A I sold part of it—I sold 200 oz the first time—I sold that to a man named Saward—I had known Saward several years—when I first became acquainted with him he kept chambers at No 4 Hare-court Temple as a barrister—I have seen him at Westminster-hall pleading as a barrister sometimes—it was in Bell s Pond road that I saw him when I had this dealing with him about the gold at a public-house of the sign of the Alma—I think I sold him 500 oz in all 200 the first time and 300 afterwards—he paid me 3l 2s 6d per oz for it—he paid me in gold—he charged 6d or 1s per oz commission—about this time I had another little quarrel with Fanny Kay in consequence of which I left her at Shepherd s-bush and took apartments at Kilburn—I went by the name of Adams there—I left Fanny Kay in possession of the house at Cambridge-villas I merely took my trunk—we had removed the gold previous to that to Crown-terrace Pierce s house—I do not think it had been moved to Pierce s before I sold that to Saward—about this time Pierce moved from Crown-terrace to Kilburn-villa about half a mile nearer to London than where I was lodging—I left my lodging and went and stopped with Pierce a little while and then I took apartments in Stanley-place Paddington-green where I resided at the time I was arrested upon the charge of which I was convicted which was on 15th Aug —I lived in Pierce s house with him about a week or it might be a fortnight—during the time I was there Tester and Burgess both came there by appointment which I had made—when we were all four together it was named what money there was and a division took place—I and Pierce and Tester received 600l each and Burgess received 700l —that was the produce of the gold that had been sold and the American coin—they received it in notes all of it—we had received it in gold and Pierce took the gold to the Bank of England and obtained notes for it—the notes that I received as my share 600l were in my trunk at Stanley-terrace at the time I was arrested—Pierce had the remainder of the gold—he made a hole in the pantry at the bottom of the stairs of his own house at Kilburn-villa and there he buried it under the steps which go into the house from the front garden—there is a fore court to the house—you ascend to the house by four or five steps—the pantry is underneath those steps and he made the hole in the pantry—we were together for some time on the evening that the division was made—I stopped there rather late all the busses had gone—I walked with Tester and Burgess to the cab stand by the canal bridge that runs across the Paddington road and they got into a cab and came to town Q Were you at the time of the robbery and afterwards in possession of any Spanish bonds A I had 700l worth—they were 100l bonds I believe—I had bought them through Mr Young a stockbroker of Bartholomew-lane—that was some considerable time before the robbery I do not remember when—I sold 500l worth of those bonds to Tester on the night of the division at 48l per 100l —he paid me for them with part of the notes that he had received as his share of the division—I never saw anything more of the remaining gold—the Spanish bonds are payable to bearer transferble through a stockbroker—on the morning that I was arrested I saw Pierce at his house and made an appointment with him to meet me at my lodging in Stanley-place at 2 o clock to walk to Shepherd s-bush to obtain the child s clothes and chaise—he had the child at that time he fetched it from the nurse the day before—he met me at 2 o clock at Stanley-place we then walked across the fields to Shepherd s-bush—he went into a public house and I went into Fanny Kay s lodging and fetched the child s clothes and chaise and gave them to Pierce—I there stopped and wrote a letter to send to the nurse with part of the chaise which they had destroyed which I intended to send by the Parcels Delivery Company—after writing that letter I got into the bus about 4 o clock or a quarter past 4 to come to Holborn to keep an appointment that was made previously by a man named Humphries—I was taken into custody on my way with the note and parcel in my hand—I afterwards made an arrangement with Pierce with respect to the care of my child—I never saw him afterwards until he was arrested—I only heard from him through Mr Wontner—I had stock to the amount of 3 000l at the time—Mr Wontner had that money and he gave it over to Pierce s wife to invest for the benefit of my child and its mother Fanny Kay Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY with MR RIBTON for Pierce Q How old are you A Forty-one—I have been in employment—I was at Mr Davis s for one place in Chiswell-street a linendraper—I was there for four years—that is fourteen years ago probably it might be twenty years—I could not say positively—I will not venture to say whether or not it was twenty-two years ago—there was not a robbery there while I was there nor shortly after I left to my knowledge—I have never been in any employment since then—I have earned my living by speculating in the United States of America buying various things—I have been to America several times—I do not know the date of my first going to America—it was not ten years after leaving Mr Davis probably five years—it might be five and it might be three I cannot say—between the time I left Mr Davis and the time of my going to America I lived on what I had got—I decline answering how I had got it—I was not engaged in forgeries—I never was engaged in forgeries—I decline answering what it was—I did not know Saward then—I decline answering how I got my living then—I speculated in America in various things not in crime—I did not commit robberies whilst I was in America or pass cheques—I had no cheques or bills—I have known Saward I should say probably six years it may be longer Q Is he now under charge of forgery A I know not what he is under charge of I will swear that—I have been in prison—I did not see Saward at the Mansion House—I do not know that he is arrested—I never knew Saward by any other name than barrister Saward or James Saward —I have never had anything to do with him in the way of cheques—I have discounted bills for him—I have not had any transactions with cheques with him—I never presented a forged cheque in my life nor ever caused any to be presented—I can swear that I never committed a forgery or ever caused a forgery to be committed in my life—I am perfectly innocent of the charge I was convicted of—I was convicted upon false evidence—I never presented a forged note—I have received the proceeds of forgeries I forget how much a small amount—I should call a few thousands a very great amount—I had 3 000l in the bank and it had been there for some years a portion of it—that stock was purchased before this robbery took place—the 600l Pierce had your client—the charge I was convicted upon was a charge of uttering a forged cheque for 100l —I was caught running away with a bag of farthings instead of sovereigns in my possession—I was tried in this Court I believe Q You tell us that you filed these keys what were you originally by calling A I can work at almost anything I worked at jewellery and carpentering—I can make jewellery Q And bars of gold also A Well there is proof of that—I do not know whether Pierce was a betting man I never knew him to have any money to bet—whilst this robbery was being perpetrated I was in the railway carriage which was in motion on the railway Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE with MR SLEIGH for Tester Q You decline to tell my Mend how you were gaining your livelihood for the three years after you left the linendraper s establishment A Yes—I have no particular motive for declining—I decline on the ground that I am not bound to answer—I will not answer the question unless I am compelled to do so—I am not afraid—if I am compelled so to do I will—I am not afraid of the consequences to myself—I am not afraid of being subjected to a prosecution—I decline to answer—I had known Tester between three and four years Q How was it do you think that Pierce suggested to you to be a party to this robbery did he know you to be a rogue A He was introduced to me by two thieves and at once opened the business and found himself quite at home—I did not say that the first time I saw Tester was down at Margate—I did see him there and went with him to his lodgings and took tea with him—when you went out of the station you turned to the left and the house faced you I do not know the name of the place —I have been down to Margate several times—I may have given a description of the place to the prosecution—he occupied the front parlour—an elderly female who kept the house served the tea I do not know her name—I did not see anybody else there I did not sleep there I slept at a public house of the sign of the Elephant where Tester went and partook of a glass of grog with me in the smoking room—I met Tester on one occasion at Folkestone and walked arm in arm with him from the up station we usually used to walk arm in arm when we met—I say we did so on that occasion because we always did so that is my only motive—I did not always walk arm in arm with him in London I did when I met him out of town—I will not say positively there might be an exception but generally speaking we always walked arm in arm when I met him out of town—I am positive we walked arm in arm from the up station—I do not know whether anybody saw us arm in arm or not it is impossible for me to say—the division of the plunder was as near as my recollection will admit of about two months after the robbery—it was Tester s own proposition that he should buy the Spanish bonds—he did not know that I had Spanish bonds to sell—he asked me which was the best way for him to invest his money I told him that Spanish bonds were paying 7 per cent and it was merely transferring a bit of paper I had some that I bought at 47 or something thereabout and I would sell them to him at 48—he consented to do so and took 500l worth of them at 48l without making any further inquiry—I told him whom I had purchased them of—I believe the market price was about 47 at the time—I do not know when it was I purchased them the bill was in my trunk when I was arrested it was some long time before I could not state the time—I have not any of these Spanish bonds left I had 200 Pierce had it it was in my trunk when I was arrested and Pierce had the remaining 200—I have not seen him since—I was arrested on a charge of uttering a forged cheque you defended me Q The evidence and almost the only evidence against you was that of an accomplice A He was not an accomplice of mine I never knew the man—he said he was an accomplice—every word he said was a lie you stated so yourself—Mr Mullens was a witness against me but he never gave any evidence against me till the day of my trial and then he stated that he saw me outside the bank he did not state what was true he stated that I was outside the bank and I was at Shepherd s-bush at the time—Mr Mullens was solicitor for the prosecution—he stated an untruth on his oath Q You were a good deal upon this line were you not A I was travelling up and down I did not call myself anything I left it to Burgess—I went to try the keys in the safe when I had got them—I used not to travel except with a view to this robbery I had no occasion on that line—I was called a commercial traveller I have called myself so—I did not tell Tester that I was a commercial traveller if any stranger asked me the question I said so—Tester knew I was a thief I was introduced to him as such—I have represented myself as a commercial traveller at any hotel I was stopping at—I had no communication with anybody on the line with the exception of the prisoners and the man at Folkestone also—I tried to get the impressions of the keys from the company s servant I tried to get the keys from him—I did not try to get him to betray his trust on my oath—I endeavoured to get the impressions of the keys unknown to the servants down there none of them knew what I was there for—I did not try to make Sharman betray his trust—I did not try to make him an accomplice with me—I got into communication with him to be familiar with him and when his back was turned to get the keys from their place—that was part of the plan between me and Tester—I was wandering up and down the line for that purpose—I do not mean to state that Tester corrupted my innocence—I have said that I could not make any impression upon Sharman—I mean by that I could not form any connection with him so as to be in the office while he was there issuing tickets or so on Cross-examined by MR POLAND with MESSRS GIFFARD and LEWIS for Burgess Q How many names have you gone by A Three or four—Adams Archer Agar which is my own name and the other names were what Tester gave me—I have gone by the name of Roberts—Pierce gave me that name—I answered to any name they thought proper to call me—I first stated what I have told to-day down at Portland—I first had a communication with Mr Bees—I did not when I first saw him tell him that Burgess had nothing whatever to do with it—Mr Bees did not mention Burgess s name tome he mentioned no names—I did not on any occasion say that Burgess had nothing whatever to do with it that I swear—I have never said so—after I came back from Folkestone I communicated with Burgess—I do not remember ever saying that I did not communicate with Burgess—I do not remember whether I have or not—we were in the habit of meeting Burgess and communicating to him what had taken place—these were not the first false keys that I had made I made some for Pierce to commit the robbery at the South Eastern station no others that I am aware of I might have made others for what I know—I have received the proceeds of forgeries probably three or four times—the money I had in the Bank of England was not the proceeds of forgeries—I obtained it by hard work and speculations as I said before in the United States none of it was the proceeds of robberies—I never passed off any forged notes in America or anywhere else I have not passed off any notes that were stolen here—I saw Burgess several times after the robbery was committed it would he impossible for me to tell the number of times I met him—I never saw him after the robbery until the night of the division MR BODKIN Q You were asked how you got your living during a particular period of your life after you left the draper s and before you went to America you state that you are not afraid of any prosecution in consequence of that A No I am not—I did not state it because Mr Parry wished to force it out of me and I was not bound to state it that was the only motive I had for declining—I have no objection to state it—when I left Mr Davis I had saved up a sum of money nearly 50l—I kept myself by that for some considerable time and pledging my clothes and I was with a cousin of mine a boot-closer—I used to assist him a little—I supported myself in that way until I went to the United States COURT Q There could be no reason why you should not hare told that A No I had no objection only Mr Parry wished to force me MR BODKIN Q You have been asked particularly about the case upon which you were convicted A Yes it was for uttering a forged banker s check which a party stated I gave him—the man that gave the evidence against me gave the name of Smith—I know no further of him whether that was his name or not I cannot say—I knew nothing of the man previous to his giving me in charge—there was a man named Humphries in it he was an accomplice of Saward s and several others—at that time I was living with a female named Emily Campbell—Humphries was also acquainted with her—she bad at one time lived with him and passed as Mrs Humphries—she was living with me at Stanley-place at the time the charge was made against me—Humphries was not examined as a witness it was a vindictive feeling that was the cause of my being arrested—Mr Mullens stated that which was not true he said he was in a bank opposite when the man went in to present the cheque and to the best of his belief I was the man who was standing outside he never stated it on any of the examinations—I was not there I was at Shepherd s-bush at the time—I had never been in the city at any time that day until I was taken in charge—I was met by some man who handed to me a bag containing farthings instead of sovereigns—he was standing at the corner of Bedford-row where he could command a view of Humphries house as my appointment was to be at Humphries house at 5 o clock to receive from him 235l that I had lent him on the Monday previous—I had an appointment to meet him at his house and receive the 235l —his house was a door or two from the corner of Bedford-row where Smith was standing—this was on the day of my arrest—as I was going to Humphries Smith was standing at the corner—he turned round and saw me coming down—he approached me and said Oh I am watching for you —I asked what he was watching for me for he said that Bill meaning Humphries had sent him to meet me to tell me not to go to his house as there was a screw loose —I asked him what it was about walking my way at the same time—he said that he believed it was something about Captain Money s affair—Humphries had been arrested a week or two before on a charge of attempting to steal Captain Money s child—in walking along he said that Humphries had sent the 200/ by him at the same time pulling a bag out of his pocket and giving it me—by this time we had got near Red-lion-square—the police officers were watching—I asked him who those men were following—he said that he did not know Q We need not go into the particulars I believe directly after the police officers took you into custody A by his telling me to run away he said I will stand here and the officers won t know you are gone —the moment I ran he ran after me and called Stop thief and I stopped and was taken into custody—Goddard the officer asked me if I had taken a bag from this man—I said I had—he asked where it was and I produced it—he asked if I knew how much it contained—I said 200l I believed—I appealed to Smith and asked if that was the case—he shook his head and said he did not know COURT Q You were trepanned into this by Humphries that is your story A Yes MR BODKIN Q At the time you sold the Spanish bonds to Tester did you produce or show him Mr Young s note of the purchase A I did not I told him I would give it him I had it not by me at the time—it was in my trunk—I got it out with a view of giving it him at the next meeting—it was found in my trunk at the time I was arrested COURT Q When did you begin to lead a course of crime how early after you left Mr Davis about how soon A Probably about two or three years—I have been in business in South America which can be proved it was there that I made the greater part of my money—I continued more or less committing crimes until my arrest from three years after I left Mr Davis MR SERJEANT PARRY Q Have not you stated before in conversation with your fellow prisoners and before you made a statement at Portland Island against Pierce and other men boasted that you accomplished the robbery alone and went over to Boulogne A No I never boasted to anybody about it to the prisoners or anybody else MR BODKIN Q Was Mr Rees the first person that you made a statement to A Yes connected with this robbery—I had not heard at the time that I made that statement to Mr Bees that my child was in a state of destitution in London but I had heard that Pierce had sent it to its mother—Pierce had the charge of it when I was arrested—I had heard that the mother was in a state of distress and he had sent the child but would not give it a change of clothing THOMAS SELLINS I am bullion porter to Mr John Chaplin and have been so seven years I know Messrs Abel and Co bullion brokers—before and in May 1855 I was in the habit of calling at their place to know respecting bullion which they required to be transmitted by railway—on 15th May I called there for the particulars of a box—I did not get them—I saw Mr Rance an elderly gentleman there and he told me to call again—I required the particulars to bring to Mr Chaplin—I saw some gold bars in the window at that time—I called again about twenty minutes to 6 o clock as near as I can say—Mr Chaplin was then out of town—I got the particulars and when I came back I met Mr Chaplin at his office and he gave me the receipt to go and fetch the box—I then went back with another porter to Abel s for the box—it was brought to the Spread Eagle—I saw it removed from there into a cab—Mr Chaplin was standing at the side—I went outside the cab to the Dover station and saw the box delivered—Mr John Chaplin went with me and booked it JOHN CHAPLIN I sent Sellins to Messrs Abel s for this box of gold—it was brought to me at the Spread Eagle and delivered into my charge—it was never more than two or three yards from me—I went with it to the South Eastern Railway and delivered it to Mr Weatherhead the station master Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTING Q TO whom would it be known that bullion was going that night A I sent our porter about twenty minutes before but to my knowledge they could not know at the railway that bullion was going to Folkestone—until I received the receipt I did not even know that it was going—Mr Weatherhead was the party with whom I arranged for its transmission—the Railway Company did not say that I never delivered it at all they took an entry of it—it was even suggested to my knowledge that it was lost in the transit to the railway office MR SERJEANT SHEE Q When did you arrive with the box at the South Eastern Railway A About half past 7 o clock as near as possible—I delivered it to the station master on the platform—there is an office there—I saw it placed on the scale and weighed and then taken into Mr Weather-head s office and signed for—I believe this produced is the box it has all the appearance of it EDGAR COX In 1855 I was a clerk in Mr Weatberhead s office at the South Eastern Railway I speak of Mr Weatherhead who is now governor of Newgate—he was then station master—I remember Mr Chaplin bringing three boxes On the evening before the robbery they were like those produced—I knew that they were supposed to contain bullion—they were placed on the side of the scale which is outside on the platform close to the door of the superintendent s office—the weights were taken by me—the box like this which is marked P D 184 weighed 1cwt 1 qr 16 lbs —the box of Mr Spiel man s weighed 18 lbs and the other 2 cwt 2 qrs 15 lbs —after they were weighed they were put on a truck or barrow and taken into Mr Weatherhead s office where they remained till the train was about to start—Tester was in Mr Brown s office the superintendent s which is up stairs on the first floor—I do not think Tester in the course of his employment would have the means of ascertaining when bullion was going down—the book in which we enter the weights is in the station master s office near the platform—besides me there was a party named Bailey and Scanlan—Scanlan weighed them and I took the weights from him Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Is that the identical box which was delivered by Mr Chaplin to you A It has the same marks that is the only thing I can swear to—it was taken from the cab and weighed by my direction—I believe a party named Bailey carried it from the scale to the station master s office but I cannot swear it—I believe he is here—it was in my sight the whole of the time Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Are there two porters who assist in loading the guards van before the train starts A I believe not—the chests were put outside the office with 8 30 marked on them in large figures—that is the time the train starts—they were going by the 8 30 train and any one outside the office could see that chalk mark whether he was connected with them or not—that was not always the case—it was the course of business latterly—I cannot say for certainty how long this was the ordinary course of business in the office—it was done occasionally but I cannot say the time HENRY GIBSON ABEL I am a bullion merchant carrying on business in Royal Exchange-buildings On 15th May I sent six bars of gold to my agent in Paris—I had previously received from my refiner a certificate of the weight of those bars—I was present when they were weighed—I compared the weight with the certificate it was perfectly correct—I have not got it here—it is subject to some slight difference which is caused by the assay pieces which are cut off the corner—the weight of the whole was 2 125 1/2 ounces—the weight at the railway was 1 cwt 1 qr 16 lbs —that was with the box and packing—I saw it packed in the box and the box fastened down—the box was precisely similar to this but I cannot swear to it—these are the initials of the consignee at Paris to whom I sent it P D 184—it was sealed—I do not think this seal on it is any part of our seal— the witness examined it with a candle —I swear that neither of these are our seals—we only seal them in one place Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q I think you brought an action against the Company A No we were going to—they resisted our claim from May to Dec 1855 on the ground that the box was lost between Boulogne and Paris—they kept us out of our money the whole of that time which we did not think very gentlemanly if you ask me the question JOHN BAILEY On 15th May 1855 I was a porter at the South Eastern Railway station I remember Messrs Abel s box being brought—I saw it in the scale and removed it from the scale to the truck to be carried to the iron chests—I put in the three boxes of bullion and Mr Weatherhead locked the chests in my presence—there are two iron chests the large box was in one and the two small ones in the other—I believe Cox was by—the chest remained in Mr Weatherhead s office till 5 or 10 minutes after 8 o clock and then I delivered them to Burgess the guard and put them into his van—I had two journeys of it and he assisted me in putting them into the van Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Do you remember the particular night of the 15th you have alluded to the date A I remember taking them up as usual—I have a distinct remembrance of that particular night—Kennedy was a guard of that train that night—he is here JOHN KENNEDY I was under guard to Burgess on the South Eastern Railway—I went with the 8 30 train on 15th May 1855—I was on the platform three-quarters of an hour before the train started and continued there till it started —the hinder van was under my management I loaded it—it was not my duty to load the first van Burgess loaded it—there were a good many passengers that night and Burgess asked me to look round the train before we started to see that the doors were all shut and that the train was properly coupled together as he was going out a little way—I do not know what became of him after that I lost sight of him—I saw him return in probably a quarter of an hour I cannot speak to a few minutes—I went down with the train having walked along it to see that the doors were shut and everything right—it was going from London to Dover—I have seen Agar several times—I did not know his name to be Agar but I saw the same man at the Mansion House—I had before that seen him with Burgess in Duke-street that was in the latter end of April or the beginning of May 1855 probably a fortnight or so before the robbery—it was at a public house—I do not know the name of it but Mr Bolton is the proprietor—there were several persons round the bar but I know nothing of them—Burgess and Agar were talking together for perhaps five minutes—I said Good morning Mr Burgess and he said Good morning —I said nothing else at that time—I have not seen them together at any other time—I did not say just now that I had seen them together several times—I said that I bad seen Agar several times—I have seen him on the platform at the London-bridge Station—I have not seen him go down by any train—I have seen him about 8 o clock—that was about half an hour before the train started—that has been the general time from a quarter to 8 to 8 o clock—Burgess was the guard of that train Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q You went down with the train that evening did not you A I did—I rode in the hind van—I got out at the stations it is my duty—I never saw Burgess on the journey from the time I left London till I got to Dover—I sometimes see passengers at the stations if they get out of one carriage into another Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Can you tell me what number of parcels you had A I was not in charge of the parcels—I did not deliver parcels on the way that was Burgess s duty—he would have to get out at the stations take the parcels and deliver them to the party in attendance whether it was the station master or the porter—if there were no parties there it would not be his duty to take the parcels into the station himself—I cannot tell you whether he got out at a great many stations that night or whether there were a great many parcels to deliver—I never saw him from the time we started till we got to Dover—at the intermediate stations I give the signal that I am ready at the hind part of the train to start—Burgess has started without that signal from me but it is his duty to wait till I give it—I gave the signal to start on this particular occasion—I give it by lights I hold a light at one end of the train And it would be shown again at the other that would be Burgess s duty—I cannot say that I received signals by light from Burgess at every station but I did at probably one or two—I took no notice whether there was anything particular about that journey or whether I received my signals as usual it was the same as any other night—I saw nothing particular—I first heard of the rubbery it might be a week afterwards—I cannot tell to a day or two—I do not know who first spoke to me about it—I was not asked about it at first—I was told that such a thing had taken place with my train—I was examined by the lawyer I cannot tell how soon after the robbery—I was not taken over as a witness to France—I never was there in my life—it was not my duty to go to Burgess s van at all nor used I to do so with the exception of Sunday night—the 15th May was to the best of my recollection Tuesday—the head guard receives the parcels from the porters they bring them to the van—I was not there to see whether the door was wide open but in the ordinary course of things it is—if the head guard was away for a moment and the doors were open and anybody was there they might step in—I was three months on that train—I do not know how often on an average the bullion box went down with the train—I have been in the company s service thirteen years—as under guard it was my duty to open the doors of the carriages when there was an opportunity—I did when there was a chance—if I was opposite a door and a passenger wanted to get out I should open it if I was not there somebody else would do it—I did not get out specially at every station to see whether any passenger wanted to get out I certainly get out of the van at every station that is to put my luggage out of the van and to put luggage in my van was not running empty there was luggage in it—I have also to open the doors for passengers if they want to get out and I am there—I also shut the windows up if they are open and shut the doors when passengers have got out and if a passenger gets in I open the door for him provided it is shut and anything else that is necessary—I have had no complaints of my not doing my duty on the night of 15th May—I did my duty to the beat of my ability but a servant does not always know when his duty is done—it was not the first time I had seen Agar when I saw him and Burgess talking together—I had seen him perhaps five or six times before but had never said Good morning to him—I had seen him about London-bridge platform—I cannot tell you the first time I saw him but it was about April—I cannot tell to a few days or weeks MR BODKIN Q Were you in the habit of going with Burgess by the same train A Yes I went with him two months—I had gone with him before that with other trains RICHARD HART I live at the upper station Folkestone I remember the mail train arriving on the night of 15th May 1855—I was at the upper station when it arrived and saw the bullion chest taken out of it—Cook the watchman assisted in taking it out and myself I do not recollect anybody else—Burgess was present when it was taken out—it appeared to me as usual when I have seen it taken out there are two of them —I had it put on my truck after the train was gone and took it to the harbour and delivered it to Spicer the watchman—I was never absent from it Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Do you know how long it was left at Folkestone A No JOHN SPICER On 15th May I was night watchman at the lower station at Folkestone I was on duty at half past 10 o clock when the train arrived—I recollect the iron chests being taken out of the truck—they were taken into the booking office—I had charge of them during the night—they were not removed from the place where they were put and nobody had access to them but myself—I left duty at half past 8 o clock next morning—they were there then Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q How long was it at Folkestone A I cannot say—I was on watch in the booking office—that is at the harbour right opposite the telegraph office inside but on the platform of the booking office—it was not my duty to call up some of the hands that morning but it is in the ordinary course of things—I have to call Mr Dyne the station master and have to go about a quarter of a mile to do so—I was not taken over to France to be examined as a witness against the French railway—I gave my statement to the lawyer about it at the time the inquiry was going on in France but he did not take me over ROBERT MACKAY I am telegraph clerk at the lower station at Folke-stone I was on duty on the night of the robbery and was in the telegraph office moat part of the night—I was in the booking office and saw one of the bullion chests brought in—I was not there when the other was brought in but I saw them standing one on the other opposite the telegraph office—I was there all night and from time to time saw them safe—they were not moved from the place where they were set down—I do not recollect their going off—I left at 8 o clock—I do not know at what time they left—I did not notice them when I left—I noticed them up to the time that our own man came on duty at 6 o clock JOHN MCNIE In May 1855 I was a police officer in the service of the South Eastern Company at Folkestone I remember coming on duty on the morning of 16th May and Spicer pointing out to me two iron chests in the booking office—we generally term them bullion chests—I saw them taken down and delivered on board the boat in the same condition in which I saw them first Cross-examined by Mr GIFFARD Q Were you taken to France A No—I remember hearing of the trial that was going to take place in France—I did not give a statement to the lawyer of the South Eastern Company at that time I was not asked COURT Q At what o clock did the boat go A Between 8 and 11 o clock I cannot well answer the question JAMES GOLDER In May 1855 I was mate of the Lord Warden steam boat between Folkestone and Boulogne On 16th May the boat started at half past 10 o clock—I keep a log—I remember the iron safes coming on board that morning—I was present and received them and placed them midships on deck—they remained there during the whole of the passage under my eye the whole time—nobody had an opportunity of interfering with them—there were ninety-five passengers—keys to open the chest were in the captain s charge—the chests were opened at Boulogne—I did not see the wooden boxes with the bullion as was supposed in them taken out but I saw the larger box dragged away from the iron safe—it was in very bad condition—the side was bulged out so that I could get my finger in—I only saw the large one Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q What was the name of the captain A Captain Paul—I do not know Agar by sight—I have not seen him—the captain never lost the key of one of those chests to my knowledge JACQUES THORON through an interpreter I am employed in the Customs at Boulogne I was present at the arrival of the Lord Warden on 16th May 1855 between 12 and 1 o clock and went on board—I saw the cash box opened and I took out the small box—there was only one that I took out—I only arrived in time to take one out—I saw two on the cart and took one myself—they were taken from the boat to the Douane by persons employed by the Customs—the same parties that took the others took mine along with them—a plank was laid down from the quay to the deck of the vessel up which the luggage was taken—in unloading one of the boxes I noticed that it was open the width of my fingers and I remarked when I removed it that there was a bag moving about in it—it was black and white speckled just the same as these produced—I stopped there till Mr Major arrived—I gave the box two knocks with ray heel to close it—it was placed in the Custom House in the same place where they deposit all the luggage coming from the boat which has to be examined—on entering the scales are to the left and the other boxes were placed two or three feet from that place—the boxes continued in that state till Mr Major came—I was there and saw them all the time until his arrival COURT Q Who opened the iron safe A I did not see—I know Mr Barnard perfectly well and I believe it was one of his men who opened it JAMES HAMEL MAJOR I am agent at Boulogne to the Society of the Messageries Generates The South Eastern Company have an agent at Boulogne Mr Barnard—it is usual for the way bill to be produced to the broker for general merchandise but I receive the way bill of the bullion from Mr Chapman and Mr Barnard receives one from the company in duplicate—I remember the bullion chests arriving on 16th May and their being taken to the Custom House—they were not opened there bullion paying the highest duty it is not necessary and it was late in the day—they were weighed at the Custom House in my presence—one box marked P D 184 weighed in French measurement 54 kilogrammes 500 grammes—they weighed together 190 kilogrammes—the third box being so small was put on the others and it produced then 198 kilogrammes being 8 kilogrammes more—after they had been weighed the large box being in bad condition I had it nailed by the labouring men attached to the Custom House and had it put on a truck and had the small box put into a safe place in the truck and the second one outside with other bales and packages and dragged to my office—I happened to see them all the way but I do not generally do so—when they got to my office they were unloaded and remained there till they were sent to the rail under the charge of our guard—they were weighed separately at my office—the box P D 184 weighed 54 kilogrammes 500 grammes the other 136 kilogrammes 500 grammes and the small box of Spiel man s 7 kilogrammes 100 grammes the total was 198 kilogrammes and 100 grammes—I had no idea of anything then—I afterwards received the weights taken at the London bridge terminus—I have reduced the English measures to French—the English weight of the box P D in London has been sent to me as 1 cwt 2 qrs 16 lbs which I calculate and represent in French measure as 70 kilogrammes 725 grammes that is 71 all but one quarter—in the French weight it is 16 kilometres and a trifling fraction less in London than in France—I have not calculated what the English weight of 16 kilogrammes 620 grammes is but 1 cwt is 70 kilogrammes there are 2 lbs avoirdupois to a kilogramme—I was informed also of the weight in London of the other two boxes and found that the weight of them in France was something more—I went with the boxes to my office and joined them as they were going into my yard and went in with them immediately as I was busy—they remained in my office under my eye all the time—the two large boxes were before me and the small one behind me and about half past 6 o clock or a quarter to 7 they were put on the same truck and taken down to the railway—I did not see them down there but I have people who generally go with them—I saw them on the truck—I saw the one marked P D 184 afterwards at Paris open on 18th May—the others had been delivered and opened by the consignee—it had not been opened when I saw it on 18th May it was in the same condition as when I saw it at Boulogne—I saw it opened—I was present when it was weighed—I insisted on its being weighed before me—the box and contents were weighed together and weighed 54 kilogrammes 700 or 800 grammes and a fraction it was a few grammes more than my weight but substantially the same weight as mine or little above it but not anything of importance—the deficiency was not greater but our scales in the office were used—it was all put in together with the lid and all and then of course it was weighed to a very great nicety and produced nearly 200 grammes more—when the box was opened it was completely full of bags of this description containing lead—one bag in the middle had been cut through with a knife the box being apparently too full for the lid to lie down and the shot had spread and was mixed with the bags—there were two sizes of shot the bag that was cut was the same size I believe but the Commissary of police found two sues Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Did you see the box opened A Yes in fact I was called up for that purpose but only the box P D —there was nothing in it but bags of shot and a few wood shavings—I did not afterwards see either of the other boxes after they were opened I returned to Boulogne—I did not see two sizes of shot I think in the bag that was cut they were the same size—I did not afterwards see any leaves of a French pamphlet although I heard that there was a pamphlet in one of the boxes—I saw a piece of sacking found at the messagerie—I have not brought it with me as it was not the same at all it was cotton stuff it was blue but the blue was much darker it was chequered like this—I knew that I was coming to be examined in respect to this matter but I never thought to bring it it is at my house the Commissary of police took part of it and I took part—my attention was called to it at Boulogne—it was not found at my house but at the house of one of my porters by one of the Commissary s men and brought to the chief Commissary who was at my office at the time—I did not see the leaves of a pamphlet I only heard it mentioned the Commissary of police told me I do not think he is here—I saw one quality of shot it was in bags which were put under seal by the Commissary—I saw the shot which was spread about in the box—my attention was not drawn to the fact of its being half English and half French manufacture I tried it and found that it was English shot it is much softer you can tell by biting it—I never heard that it was half English and half French—I tried it to know whether it was English or French not whether it was half English and half French—I am of opinion that what I tried was English—it is all here it was put under seal by the police at Paris MR BODKIN Q Do you find in this bag two sizes A I do not think there are looking at it there is only one size in this bag—the other a parcel in brown paper contains shot of different sizes small and large it has lost it s brightness but it is English shot—it was the Commissary of Police at Boulogne the police of Paris called upon the police of Boulogne to assist them—I did not compare the two bags but I am certain they are not the same—I had an opportunity of judging whether there was any similarity between the piece of check produced at Boulogne and the bags and it was completely different it was a darker blue quite a different dye HARRIET HOOKER I am the wife of a fly driver at Folkestone I live between the South Eastern Railway station and the town In May 1854 two persons lodged at our apartments they were taken in the name of Adams—I have seen Adams since at the Mansion House he then went by the name of Agar—I have not seen the other person who took lodgings with him he was of rather a dark complexion dark whiskers and rather brown dark hair the further one of the three prisoners is him—Pierce remained a week and Agar a week after Pierce left—while there they went out walking chiefly not at any particular time but after breakfast—they were walking almost all day except in and out and they came in to dinner—after Pierce went Agar went out as before—Pierce stated that business called him away to London and he could not stay any longer in Folkestone—he did not tell me that he was going Adams told me Adams was head and chief—I did not know that Pierce was going more than a day before he went Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q When was that A On 9th May 1854—I have got my book which I can show you—I speak particularly to Pierce—I am quite certain of him—I described him with dark whiskers and dark brown hair—there was nothing particular going on at Folkestone then that I know of—they went in and out like other lodgers at the sea side—we generally find lodgers go out after breakfast for the sea air—I do not remember that there was any embarkation of troops from Folkestone—I did not see Pierce again to recognise him till to-day—I have never recognised him before to-day—I was examined at the Mansion House but I did not see Pierce—Adams was brought in for me to recognise but not a word was said about Pierce—I do not know that I have mentioned his name in the witnesses room to-day—I have not been asked anything about him—I did not look about enough to see him at the Mansion House—I never looked round only to recognise Adams—I spoke of another man but I was not asked to pick him out THOMAS LEDGER I am Custom House agent at the Harbour station at Folkestone On 28th Oct 1854 I was married and went away from my duties for a short time from Saturday 7th till I think the following Wednesday or Thursday—I was absent on 30th Oct —I do not know Agar by that name—I have seen a man go through the Court that I have seen at Folke-stone—I do not know his name—I saw him previous to my marriage at the Rose Inn kept by Medhurst—I saw him there twice—I do not think that house is frequented by the servants of the company—I only know one who frequents it besides me that is Mr Chapman—I have seen the man sitting there but not conversing with anybody—I do not recollect that I have spoken to him—there is a billiard room there and a smoking room—I recollect once Agar was introduced by the landlord when I and a clerk in the Provincial Bank were in there to supper before my marriage—the landlord brought him in and in consequence of what the landlord said he came and had supper with us—after my return from my wedding trip I saw Agar again—I now distinctly recollect seeing him on the harbour he spoke to me and told me that during my absence he had forwarded a valuable parcel to my address—I do not think that was many days after I returned—he did not invite me to go anywhere at that time but I must have seen him afterwards because he asked me if I would go to the Pavilion and take wine with him which I declined—a person there named Conden made a communication to me in consequence of my being with Agar—my office is close upon the harbour on the pier—I had a key of the bullion chest—I cannot say for certain the exact place where I kept it but it must have been either in the bullion room or in my pocket or in a desk which I had behind me—there is no drawer to my desk or under it or near it nor in anybody else s desk in which tickets are kept—a person named Sharland had an office quite separate from mine—when a boat arrives from Boulogne it is my duty to attend to the landing of the passengers and render them any assistance they may require in passing their baggage and Chapman s duty is partly the same he sits by my side—on the arrival of a boat I should go out to the landing of the passengers and Chapman sometimes goes—either the superintendent s clerk or Mr Chapman s assistant would remain in the office—I have known the office to be left when a boat arrives—there are two locks on the bullion chest but I believe only one was in use at the time of the robbery—I was on duty on the night of the robbery—I do not think I saw the bullion chests removed that night—I do not recollect it but I saw them next morning and saw them put on board the steam boat in the charge of McNie Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q Do you generally keep the key either in your desk or in your pocket A I did then I have kept it in the bullion room which is in my office—Sharman is not in my office Chapman is and also Mr Jones Mr Wellan Mr Lisle and a youth that he had as an assistant and the superintendent it is in fact the steam packet office—the superintendent has a private office to himself an inner office I mean the captain of the harbour—when I went out I should not look round to see whether the superintendent or some of the clerks are there if the boat is coming in—we never all go down to meet the boat—they should go on with their duties while I go on with mine—Chapman did not always go down with me I have a recollection of his doing so at times—I was not examined before the Magistrate I did not get my letter soon enough or I should have been there at 10 o clock in the morning but I did not get my letter till that time—that was the last examination but one and I was not summoned on the last—I should think it must have been in the spring of 1844 that I first saw Agar—I was married in Oct 1854 and saw him again after that Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Do you recollect the circumstance of one of the keys of the bullion chest being lost by one of the captains of the boats A I do by Captain Mold—I believe it was through that that he left the service of the company he left shortly afterwards—I cannot speak to the time but it was certainly before I was married some time before I should not like to fix upon the date MR BODKIN Q How many times have you ever known the office to be left without anybody in it when a boat arrived A I cannot say for a certainty but I have known it I have gone and found it empty and I should think if I said a dozen times I should not be under the mark—what we generally call the bullion room is a sort of closet in the office—I should think it is twelve feet high by about ten feet wide—it is a small room the door of it is about four or five yards from the outer door of the office—the office is railed off and you pass through a swing door and then through another you then come to Mr Jones s desk and directly at his back is the bullion room—there are places there where keys can be hung up there is no light only from the door—the key of the bullion chest has been hung up in that closet and it would be only three or four feet from the person who opened the door as it hung on the wall CHARLES JAMES CHAPMAN In 1855 and 1856 I was in the service of the South Eastern Railway Company at Folkestone I know Agar—I first saw him at Folkestone in the spring of 1854—I was at that time export agent to the company and my office was on the quay—when I first saw him he was alone—when I first saw him he was in the coffee room of the Rose Mr Medhurst s—I remember his coming down to Folkestone in the autumn—he came to my office to inquire for a valuable parcel on Saturday 28th Oct which he said he expected—I told him that it had not arrived he called on the Monday it had then arrived and I gave it to him—I took it from the iron safe which I unlocked before him and he might have seen where I took the key from—I cannot say whether I replaced the key in his presence after I had taken the box out—I produced the bullion way bill to him and asked him to sign a receipt on it—he requested me to draw it out in consequence of having wounded two of his fingers—I saw that two of his fingers were In a black silk bag—I wrote the body of the receipt and he signed it in the name of Archer he had inquired for a parcel in the name of Archer —this C R Archer on this way bill produced is his writing Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q You kept the key of the bullion room A I did I had it on my person for one week that was in Mr Ledger s absence—that is the only time that I have kept it—when the key was wanted it was taken away I mean the key of the bullion room—the key of the bullion safe was never put in the bullion room—it was my custom when I went out to lock the bullion room door and take the key with me—Mr Ledger will tell you whether it was his custom—I always did so to the best of my knowledge I considered it my duty Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Were the two keys of the iron safe never put in the bullion room A I cannot say CHARLEMAGNE EVERARD through an interpreter I am an assistant to the firm of Packham Neuffer and Co of Paris On 17th May I received from Abel and Co of London a box—this is the box I was present when it was opened it did not contain gold it contained shot it was in such bags as these Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Did you see the whole of the box turned out A Yes there was nothing in it but shot and shavings THOMAS SHARMAN I keep the Torrington Arms at Merreweather in Kent In Oct and Nov 1854 I was station clerk at Folkestone—I have seen the witness Agar—I recollect seeing him about that time in Folkestone—I saw him on the pier in Oct and Nov —I know Ledger I remember about the time of his being married—the last time that I saw Agar at Folke-stone was about the time that Ledger was married—I saw Tester with him on the pier—I went with them to the Pavilion Hotel—Tester I believe invited me to go I had known Tester before not intimately but by seeing him several times—I was on speaking terms with him—I had a friend named Greenstead with me he went with me—when I left I left Tester and Agar together—I heard one of them Tester I believe order dinner at the Pavilion for two persons—I know Hazel—he had previously said something to me about Agar Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q When you saw Agar and Tester together were they walking arm in arm A The were walking together I cannot say whether they were arm in arm—I merely knew Tester as one of the officers of the company—the officers got passes on the line at that time I did so if I wanted one—I recollect Tester being married I do not know the date I do not think it was before the robbery I do not recollect the time—I had seen Agar at Folkestone before—Tester did not introduce me to him that I recollect—I was not cautioned against associating with Agar—I was not told that I had better have nothing to do with him—Hazel drew my attention to him as a suspicious character—I went after that and had wine and biscuits with him through Tester inviting me—I did not tell Tester what I had heard about Agar MR MONK Q Did you say anything to Hazel in consequence of Tester s having brought you in company with Agar A Yes the next day I told him I thought our suspicions were not correct COURT Q In what office did you get your passes A The Superintendent s office London-bridge MR MONKS Q Was that an office in which Tester was employed A I believe so GEORGE DOUGLAS HAZEL I am inspector of police to the South Eastern Railway Company at Redhill in 1854 I held the same appointment at Folkestone harbour—I know the three prisoners—In 1854 I saw Fierce at Folkestone harbour in company with the witness Agar I believe it was in May 1854 they were on the pier standing near to where the passengers were going on board the steam-boat which was in connection with the tidal train—the tidal train had just come in—I should think they were there on that occasion about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I cannot say the exact time—I believe they remained there until the boat had sailed—I then saw them leave the pier and go in the direction of the town—I had some reason for noticing Pierce more than an ordinary person—I did not see what part of the town they went to after they had passed the pier—I did not follow them into the town—I cannot recollect whether any bullion was shipped on that day it was frequently shipped about that time—I saw them together about ten or a dozen tames after that usually on the pier at the time of the departure of the boat for Boulogne and the arrival of the boat from Boulogne—I made a communication upon this to Mr Steer the superintendent of the Folkestone police—I pointed them out to Mr Steer and also to a man that he sent to me—I saw Agar at Folkestone in Oct 1854—I saw him go into the booking office of the station at Folkestone harbour—he was there aboutten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he brought nothing out—I went in while he was there and saw him looking round at Mr Sharman the booking clerk whilst he was making up his money in the inner office adjoining the booking office—Agar was in the outer office—he could see Sharman by going to the doorway he could look round the corner at him he did so—I saw him again on the following day on the pier I think between 11 and 12 o clock—he was with Tester—the boat was then getting ready to start for Boulogne—nobody was with him when I first saw him but a very short time afterwards I saw him with Tester—I knew Tester perfectly well—I saw them go from the pier in the direction of the Pavilion Hotel—I did not watch them much beyond the station—the Pavilion Hotel is close to the station—I should think they must have been in my sight altogether for twenty minutes on that occasion—I believe Mr Ledger was away at that time his marriage was about that time—I saw Tester again that day at the harbour station—he came and went up by the train which left Folkestone harbour at half past 7 o clock in the evening Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Had you known Agar at all A Not before that—everybody goes to see the steamer come in there is very little else to see there—I cannot tell you when Tester was married whether it was before or after the robbery—he remained in the Company s service some considerable time after the robbery—I believe he then got another employment of a better kind—I cannot say whether he was highly recommended by the Company when he left—he went away with the reputation of a very good character as far as I know—at the time this inquiry commenced he was abroad he came over and surrendered—I am the person who cautioned Sharman about Agar—I only knew Agar by seeing him about the pier I did not like the look of him at all he carried it in his face—I did not give Tester any hint Tester seemed to know him so well—Tester was in the employment of the Company and a comparatively young man Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q Pierce was in the service of the Company at one time was he not A Yes as a ticket-printer—I do not know exactly when he left I should think it was about 1852—I am not aware that his business as ticket-printer took him constantly to almost every station on the line—I should say it was not his duty to visit a station when anything was the matter with the tickets there he was merely the printer of the tickets—all he had to do so far as I know was in printing the tickets—I am not aware that he ever went to put the tubes or papers to rights—I do not know how long he was in the service of the Company—I believe he was generally known over the line Cross-examined by Mr GIFFARD Q How long had Burgess been in the employment of the Company A I think ten or twelve years he was so up to the time of being taken on this charge—as soon as I officially knew of the robbery I communicated to the railway authorities what I had seen—that was long before the Company were resisting Mr Abel s claim about a week or a fortnight after the robbery—I was directed by the police officers not to mention what I knew for fear it should frustrate the ends of justice and by their wish I kept silent and by the wish of the railway authorities—I was directed to do so and I did so—Captain Barlow was managing at that time for the Company—I spoke to him on the subject and he also directed me to keep quiet—I cannot tell you the date of that it was some short time after I had seen the detective I should think within a month or so of the robbery Mr BODKIN Q You had seen the detective before you saw Captain Barlow A Yes the detective showed me an authority from the Company for making the inquiries he was making—I received directions from him to keep quiet what I knew I told that to Captain Barlow and he also told me to keep quiet JAMES STEER I am superintendent of the police at Folkestone—I was at Folkestone in May 1854—I remember seeing Pierce there about the end of May—I was in a fly and saw him pass with Agar whom I knew as Adams—in consequence of what had been said to me I noticed them particularly—they were on the way between Hythe and Folkestone—the first time I saw them they were in company together on Folkestone harbour between 10 and 11 o clock in the day—I do not recollect whether it was about the time the tidal train arrived—they observed me and generally walked away in different directions particularly Agar—I should think Agar was there a fortnight on that occasion and Pierce eight or ten days to the best of my recollection—I saw Agar again at the end of Aug or the early part of Nov opposite the Pavilion Hotel on Folkestone harbour—he was then with a tall gentleman they were both standing under one umbrella it was a rainy day—when I came near to them I observed that they saw me the tall man walked away into the Pavilion an Agar walked away in the direction of the town—I do not know who the tall man was—I knew Burgees at that time—I saw him in company with Agar on one occasion on Folkestone harbour nearly in the same place where I saw Agar in company with the tall man—I never saw Agar in Folkestone after that—I made a memorandum of this in May Cross-examined by Mr GIFFARD Q You knew Agar at the time you saw him with Burgess A I did I am quite certain of that I believe it was in Oct or Nov I could not swear which it was on the same occasion upon which I saw him with the tall gentleman—I have no doubt about it at all Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PABBT Q You say you saw Pierce there was that at the time the troops were departing for the Crimea A No there were no troops departing from there on that occasion—I do not recollect Lord Cardigan s departure—he might have departed by the boat I cannot say about that HENRY WILLIAMS I am a booking clerk to the South Eastern Railway Company—I was formerly a porter or night watchman at the Dover terminus I remember this robbery—I was on duty on the night of 15th May 1855 when the half-past 8 o clock mail train from London arrived at Dover—it came in about 11 o clock—Burgess and Kennedy were the guards that came with that train—I took no particular notice of anybody that came by that train—I remained in the booking office until the up train left Dover at 2 o clock—it was an express train with only first class carriages—I issued tickets to only two passengers by that train—besides the two persons who took those tickets I noticed two men going through the office to go up by that train—I did not notice them enough to speak to their persons—each of them had a bag in his hand—Burgess and Kennedy were in the office at the time they went through we were all three standing together—they might have seen the two persona going through—I recollect that one of the men was of a light complexion and one dark but no further than that—I was about to speak to them when I saw that they did not take tickets but Witherden the porter met them at the door and asked them if they would allow him to put their bags into the carriage—I could not hear the reply they made him—he did not take their bags—I did not see those persons get into the carriage—they west on to the platform—I issued the tickets to the two passengers who went up by tickets—one was an elderly gentleman he paid for the two tickets to the best of my recollection the other was much younger perhaps twelve years or from that to twenty—I should have taken them to be father and son Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q Do not you think they might have been uncle and nephew A Probably they might there were very few persons in the office when they passed through—it is a train that in general takes up very few passengers—there were no porters there besides myself—Burgess Kennedy and I were all three talking together—as the persons passed through two of us turned round to look at them Kennedy was sitting facing them—there were several gas lights in the office and along the platform—they were on the platform I should think about twenty minutes before the train started—I was seven or eight yards from them as they passed through Cross-examined by MR LEWIS Q You say Burgess and Kennedy came into the office A Yes I cannot say whether they came in together JOSEPH WITHERDEN I am a porter in the employment of the South Eastern Railway Company—I was on duty on the night of 15th May 1855—I remember the mail train coming in—Burgess and Kennedy were the guards—I remained on duty till about 6 o clock in the morning—I was on duty when the 2 o clock train went—I remember seeing two men going by that train—I saw them arrive at the station—I do not know them—one was taller than the other and they had kind of cloaks on and slouched hats—I cannot remember exactly whether they were long or short cloaks—they came straight through the booking office—I asked them to allow me to take their bags—they did not do so—there was another porter on duty—I supposed their bags to be heavy by the way in which they carried them—I spoke to them about their tickets and they showed me two first class tickets by way of Ostend—they were blue tickets—one of them gave me some money I cannot say which it was it was the one that sat nearest the door—I asked them if their bags had passed through the customs—they said No we came over last evening —I could not swear it but to the best of my belief the Ostend boat was not soon enough on that night for the 2 o clock train Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q I believe the train was about twenty minutes in starting after their arrival is that so A Something between twenty minutes and a quarter of an hour—I opened the carriage door for them—I did not talk to them at all only about getting the bags passed through the customs—there was plenty of light in the office on that morning MR MONKS Q At what particular time was it that the man near the door gave you the money A I was not above two or three minutes with them altogether—it was after the conversation about the Ostend tickets WERTER CLARK I keep the Rose Inn at Dover near St Mary s church in the upper part of the town—I recollect two men coming to my house in the early part of 1855—I could not swear positively to either of the men but I remember one was a short man and the other rather taller—the taller man had dark hair and whiskers and the short man had light curly hair—that I can remember but I cannot distinguish the men after that long time—to the best of my recollection the men I speak of slept at my house and went away in the morning—they said they were going to Folkestone—the short man asked me the way by the cliff side—I directed them and they left—the latter man seemed to limp a little when they started but not particularly so—I noticed it ROBERT CLARK I am waiter at the Dover Castle Hotel at Dover—I went to that situation in April 1855 on the day that the Emperor of the French landed on his visit to this country—I remember two men coming there one night after I had been there a short time—I do not know them one was rather shorter than the other—as far as I recollect they had two bags with them—I do not recollect what sort of covering they had on—they went away by the 2 o clock train—before they left they told me to put some brandy in a soda water bottle—I did so—I had to leave the room in order to do that—they left about half past 1 o clock I should think about half an hour after I had fetched the brandy—I did not see which way they went—they took their bags with them Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q Did they sup A No not that I know of—they came about 11 o clock and left about half past 1 o clock—there were gas lights in the room where they were sitting there were no other persons there JOSEPH WITHERDEN re-examined A porter named Off in was on duty that night—it was his duty to attend to the passengers as well as mine—he quitted the company s service about twelve months ago MATTHEW DICKENSON I am a policeman in the employment of the South Eastern Railway Company stationed at the London-bridge terminus—I remember the gold robbery—I was on duty on the morning of 16th May as porter at the London terminus when the train arrived which left Dover at 2 o clock it was due at half past 4 o clock—I believe there were not more than four passengers came up by it—I opened the doors to let the passengers out—I let out two passengers only from the compartment that I opened one man was a little taller than the other and one was darker complexioned than the other—the one that stepped out of the carriage first on to the platform had a bag in his hand—I did not notice the other so much—they had no luggage but what was with them in the carriage I believe there was not any luggage that morning in the luggage van but Woodhouse had the collection of that not me—the man that I let out and spoke to had a large cape on and he had dark hair and dark whiskers—I asked him if he wished for a cab and he declined it—he and the other man that got out with him went down the platform together—what became of them then I did not observe Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Were there any other porters on duty A Yes there was one porter on duty besides me—he might open some of the carriages four passengers is not an unusually small number for that train—I saw the four and very probably the other porter might—they had perhaps seventy or eighty yards to walk to get out of the station I did not speak to both of the men only to the first he answered me he declined having a cab—I did not go along with him after that till we left the station—one stepped out of the carriage immediately after the other—they walked away together—there was a policeman on duty outside at the door through which they would have to pass his name is Perry there would be two policemen at the door—I will not Bay that they must have seen the men they might have been otherwise engaged at the time it was their duty to be at the door—I have been in the company s service two years last April Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Did you communicate to the railway authorities what you had seen at the time A I did a few days afterwards to Mr Weatherhead MR BODKIN Q As soon as you heard of the robbery I suppose A Yes the duty of one of the policemen at the door would be to book the cabs if any went out and the other would call out the address and destination to which the cabs were going WILLIAM WOODHOUSE I am at present a guard on the South Eastern railway In May 1855 I was a porter at the London terminus—I was on duty there when the 2 o clock train from Dover arrived in London on 16th May 1855—it was my duty to unload the milk cans from the luggage van—to my recollection none of the passengers had luggage in the luggage van that morning—I noticed three of the passengers two walked up the platform together and the other followed a minute or two after—I am not able to recognise the two that walked together—I noticed that one was rather taller than the other very trifling—I cannot say what sort of covering they had on Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Did you see them come out of the carriages A I did not—I was about twelve or fourteen yards from them when I observed them—Dickenson was attending to the carriages—I did not see him let two men out of the carriage—I was engaged at the luggage van at the time STEPHEN JONES I am a guard in the service of the South Eastern Railway Company In April 1855 I was guard of the 7 30 evening train from Dover—I continued on that for the succeeding month of May—it is unusual to continue longer than one month—that train is due at Redhill at 9 25—the 8 30 train from London is due at Redhill at 9 4—I remember on one occasion when I reached Redhill seeing Tester there that was in May it was before I heard of the gold robbery—he was just coming out of the refreshment room door on the up side—I knew him very well as a person in the employment of the company—he had a black leather bag with him—to the best of my recollection it was about twelve or fifteen inches long—I saw him afterwards in a first class carriage—that train did not stop between Redhill and London—I did not see anything more of him that night—I know Pierce and Burgess Burgess I knew as a guard—Pierce I have seen at Folkestone in 1854—he was there in company with some one—I do not know the man—I have not seen him since that I know of—I have seen Agar but I do not recollect him—J saw Pierce and the other man on the pier at Folkestone about four or five times—I have also seen Pierce in London I have seen him at the Green Man in Tooley-street and Burgess was there at the time—that was in 1853—J have not seen him there since that Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q What time was it that you saw Tester coming out of the refreshment room A About 9 25—the train had just arrived there from Dover—I then saw him in a first class carriage in that train—it is usual for the guards only to be one month on a train—it sometimes happens they are more—it has happened about three times to my knowledge where the same guard has continued more than one month—I have been on one train for many months but that is a special service by itself and the guard is never reckoned with the other guards—Burgess was on the tidal train when it came to his turn—I have seen Tester before at Redhill—I cannot say how many times at different times—I cannot say whether he was a friend of the station master there or not—Mr Ness is the station master there I do not know whether he is here—I first mentioned about this black bag about a month or five weeks ago—I heard of the robbery five or six days after it was committed—I do not recollect mentioning about the black bag until after I had read Agar s evidence—I read a portion of Agar s evidence—I read that portion in which he charged Tester with being an accomplice of his—I never to my knowledge mentioned a word about the black bag until then I do not recollect doing so I could not swear whether I did or not—I did not know Agar—I do not know that I had ever seen him Q What makes you say that you are certain this occurred before you heard of the robbery A Because it was not so very long before I left that train altogether—J remember it perfectly well—I was only continued on that train during April and May and I should not have been there at any other time—I never recollect being on for two months at any other period before that—I had only been on one month—I would not swear I had not been two because I am not positive—I can pledge my oath that it was during that two months that I saw the black bag—I will swear that I saw Tester there in May with a bag—I say it was in May because it was the last month I worked that train—I did not mention it to anybody—I did not take particular notice of Mr Tester—I was asked a few questions about the robbery in June—I did not then mention about seeing Tester with the black bag in May because I was not asked the question—I mentioned it now because I was asked—I was never asked about it before—what I was asked about in June was if I had seen Pierce at Folkestone—I do not remember that I was asked anything else at that time—I cannot say whether when I was examined in June I knew the night on which the robbery had been committed—I believe Tester was occasionally a relieving station master—that is a person who takes the place of the station masters when they get a holiday or anything of that kind—I cannot say that I have seen Tester with bags of that kind often—I have seen relieving station masters with them and other luggage as well—I cannot say what sort of bags they carried or what sort Mr Tester carried previous to that—I know he carried a black bag that night—I do not recollect seeing a relieving station master with a black bag—there are a great number in use—I did not see anything unusual in the bag Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q You say you saw Pierce at the Green Man in Tooley-street A Yes that was not while he was in the company s service—I never knew him in the company s service—the Green Man is a house that is very much frequented by persons in the company s service Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Can you tell me whether the rotation of the under guards is the same as that of the guards A Not always there is a little difference the under guard does not usually go with the head guard on to the tidal train—with that exception he generally takes the same rotation as the other guard he generally gets changed every month MR BODKIN Q Did you ever to your recollection see Tester at Redhill with a black bag except that night A No when I was examined on this subject in June I was not questioned at all about Tester—I was asked about Pierce—the inquiry was about him FREDERICK RUSSELL I am booking clerk at the London and Brighton terminus of the Greenwich Rail way I was there in May 1855—I know Tester and knew him at that time—I recollect hearing of the robbery of the bullion box—I remember Tester coming to the office one night about 10 minutes after 10 o clock—the half past 7 o clock Dover train generally gets in at 5 minutes past 10 o clock—I cannot say whether the half past 7 o clock down train had arrived when I saw Tester—he lived at Lewisham at that time—a person could go to Greenwich only by that line not to Lewisham—he came to the window and asked me if I was going home by that train that was the last train the 20 minutes past 10 o clock to Greenwich—he said that he had been to Red-hill and back since his office hours—he brought nothing into the office at that time—Perry the night watchman was in the office at the time—Tester seemed rather excited—he came in as soon as Perry went out—there was then nobody in the office but me—he put a black bag behind me in a recess against the fire place and said that he would be back in a few minutes—he went away and after he was gone Perry returned and asked me whose bag that was—I said that it was Tester s—to my best recollection it was fifteen or eighteen inches long and nearly new—I had never seen him with it before to my knowledge—he was not in the habit of going down by that late train—he may have but I cannot recollect it—this was some time in May to my best belief—it was before I heard of the robbery—he returned and took the bag and told me that he would rejoin me at the carriage—I cannot recollect seeing anything more of the bag after that he joined me at the carriage and went with me to Greenwich and from there to Lewisham—I did not see Perry touch the bag—I was busy booting passengers Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q You say that you had not known of his going down to Red-hill before you would not have known at that time if he had not told you A No I should not be in the way of seeing—he lived about half a mile from me at that time—I do not know his family—I believe he was married at that time and had been so about two months previously—there was a fire place in the room and I was sitting opposite it it was directly behind me—if this desk was the fire place here was my booking window—he brought the bag in and put it down directly behind me on the floor I should say four yards from me—I should not almost kick against it moving towards the fire place it would be out of my way it stood close against the boards of the wall—I cannot tell whether it was fastened or how it fastened—he was away seven or eight minutes—I did not feel it—it was made of black shiny leather—it was the same as you might see a common carpet bag this sort of bag a black leather one —I have seen a good many thousand railway travellers without these bags—I went down with him that night but did not notice whether he had the bag with him—whether it was before or after the robbery I do not know but I think it was before because when we went home when we heard of the robbery it was our general discourse—I afterwards knew the day on which it was committed—I was not examined about it by the authorities of the railway—I mentioned about it about three weeks before the surrender of Tester but after the examination of Agar—we did not very often go down together at night we might—it was not usual for him to call at my window—I should not have thought it remarkable if he had gone down without me—there was not the least cause for his putting the bag into my office MR BODKIN Q There is a line of rail which goes to Lewisham direct A Yes the North Kent line but that train had gone—I cannot recollect ever having gone down with him before to Greenwich I might have MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Were you Tester and a person named Dunnell in the habit of very often going down by the Lewisham train A No I do not know whether Tester went with me I made no observation about it COURT Q Do you book for the Lewisham train A No JOHN PERRY I am night watchman at the London and Greenwich terminus—I know Tester—I remember seeing him at the Greenwich booking office one night in May 1855—it was before I heard of the gold robbery—I first saw him that night entering the Greenwich booking office it was about ten minutes past 10 o clock—the last train went at twenty minutes past 10 o clock at that time—he went to Mr Russell—there is an open window where the tickets are issued and he spoke to him through the open window—I heard what he said he said Good evening Mr Russell —Mr Russell returned the compliment and he said that he had just come from Red-hill—Mr Russell said that it was sharp work because he said that he had been between office hours—I went away then and came back about ten minutes afterwards or not quite so much and went into the office—Mr Russell was then in the office nobody else Tester had left—Mr Russell desired me to shift a box for him out of the way and I saw this black bag then down against this box—I shifted the box on one side so that I could move the box and said to Russell Whose bag is this it feels very heavy and lumpy —I took it up in my right hand and put it on one side and Mr Russell said that it was Mr Tester s—it felt heavy and lumpy just as if a stone was in it—it was about a foot long or more—I did not remain till Tester came—I did not see him go in neither did I see him come out—it must have been three or four days after that that I heard of the robbery Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTTNE Q How did you lift the bag up A With my right hand—I put it on one side—I did not feel what was in it—it was about the size of the one that is here or it might be a trifle larger—I read Agar s evidence—I never said anything about a black bag till I had read it we had not the least thought of anything of the kind—when we read Agar s evidence it freshened our memories that it was somewhere about the time that the gold robberies took place MR BODKIN Q Were you asked anything about the black bag until lately A No JOHN CHUBB I am one of the firm of Chubb and Sons lock makers of St Paul s Church-yard We made the locks for the bullion chests for the South Eastern Railway—there were four bullion chests and two locks to each—there were five keys originally made to each set of locks—the left side locks on all the chests were the same and the right hand different—that is there were two sets of locks on the four chests and five keys to each lock—in 1854 we received these letters produced —I have no doubt of their being received about the time that they bear date WILLIAM HENRY WHITE I am a clerk in the audit of the South Eastern Railway I know Tester s writing—I believe these letters are in Tester s writing except the signatures The first letter was dated 21st July 1854 to Messrs Chubb from G W Brown Superintendent South Eastern Railway requesting to see Messrs Chubb at the office at their earliest convenience respecting these bullion chests The second was dated 17th Aug from the same to the same giving an order to alter three of the keys and to make one new one with all possible dispatch with a postscript Let all these keys come to my office when altered G W B The third was 14th Aug from the same to the same requesting that the chests might be fetched the next day that No 1 keys might be altered Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Whose writing is this postscript A I believe it to be Tester s with the exception of the G W B —I am sufficiently acquainted with it to say that the postscript is his JOHN CHUBB re-examined I find that about 18tb Aug the four keys were altered and a new one was made—then on 21st and 22nd Sept the No 1 locks of two chests were altered and on 21st Oct No 1 lock of the fourth chest was altered that completed it—I have no doubt that the keys were from time to time sent to the superintendent s office agreeably to the request in those letters—the first lock would necessarily be altered when the first box was done—when I heard of the robbery I sent to the railway terminus I did not go—the chests were all brought to me and I inspected them and the locks after the robbery—I found the whole of the No 2 locks so corroded that the key would not act—they were all unlocked and opened as if they had been some weeks if not months in that state—they were unused—that was two or three days after the robbery Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Do you mean the boxes which were supposed to have been opened with a false key A Yes the whole of the four boxes which had been used for carrying the bullion—these letters are the body in Tester s writing and signed by the superintendent purporting to be under his order JOHN PEAKS KNIGHT I am out of door superintendent of the South Eastern Railway In April 1855 I was deputy to Mr Brown the superintendent of the line—Tester was one of his clerks and ranked as third clerk in the office—there was an assistant named Finnegan he was deputy—I left the company in Sep or Oct 1855—in 1854 up to May 1855 it was Mr Finnigan s duty to regulate the attendance of the guards—this produced is the routine of the guards up to April 1855—in April Burgess and Kennedy were the guards of the 8 30 mail train and the second class return train from Dover—these words And May are Tester s writing—that is what we call the mail train up and down—I remarked to Tester that it was irregular to continue the guards for two months together he replied that it was of no consequence that it had been done before or something to that effect—I entered the service of the Company in Aug 1854—before that I had nothing to do with transmitting bullion by railway—shortly after I came I heard a conversation between Mr Brown and Tester respecting the keys of the bullion chest—to the best of my recollection it was about a key being lost by one of the captains—Tester was sent to Folkestone about that—a few weeks after that several keys were returned from Messrs Chubb s after the locks had been re-combined and altered to the best of my recollection Mr Brown took charge of them and put them in a drawer in his office—that is not the office in which Tester was employed—Tester s office was the outer one next to Mr Brown s and opened into it—Tester received instructions from Mr Brown to dispose of the keys—I know no instances in which he has had occasion to visit Folkestone or Dover or Red Hill on the Company s service except with respect to these keys when they were lost Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Do you know of any occasion that he had to visit Folkestone A No except in respect of the bullion keys—that was about Aug or Sept 1854—he was then sent there to make inquiries to rectify the mistake—I believe I was present when the keys were returned from Chubb s—Mr Brown took possession of them at once—I do not know whether he is here—I have not seen him—I believe I saw him put them into his own drawer I cannot say now whether he did or not—I do not recollect consulting with him about the alteration of the time of the guards I cannot recollect that I mentioned it to him—I will not swear I did not—I mentioned it to Tester—it was unusual for guards to remain longer than a month—it had been done before on two or three occasions with an interval of twelve months between perhaps—I do not think it was occasioned by some general alteration of the trains I do not think there was one I am only speaking from memory—I do not think there was any general alteration of the trains at that period—I do not recollect the words I used to Tester but it was something about the irregularity of the affair—I do not recollect that Tester had mentioned to me before he entered those words that he intended to do so or that I had consulted Mr Brown on the subject—I do not recollect Tester mentioning it to me at all I will not swear he did not—I never heard any conversation between Tester and Brown on the subject—I believe I saw Tester make the alteration the entry—the whole of the guards would then of course continue—it did not apply to Burgess in particular but to every guard on the line—it all went on in May as in April—I do not remember any trains being altered in the middle of the month—I do not recollect consulting Mr Brown at all he generally left such matters in my hands entirely Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Have you any other of these guards duty sheets here A I believe there are several—Kennedy was for two months on the same train it might possibly be three months—Mr Finnegan is the person who up to May 1855 is responsible for that and was so at the very period you are inquiring about—I have not got the one for March here—by looking at it I should be able to tell you that Burgess and Kennedy were on the 8 30 train in March—in March April and May Kennedy was on the same train MR BODKIN Q He was the under guard was he not A Yes—the adding the words and May was done at the end of April—Finnegan had not left the service of the Company then he left about four or five months afterwards—he gave up that duty—he ceased to act in that department in April and before this alteration was made by the addition of these words—I do not recollect that anything was said by Tester about a change in the trains when that conversation took place—the answer he gave me when I expostulated with him about it was that it was of no consequence—the effect was to continue Burgess as the head guard of the mail train for the month of May JOHN MATTHEWS I manage the business of Messrs Massey goldsmiths and foreign money changers of No 116 Leadenhall-street at the corner of St Mary Axe—by my book I find that on the morning of 16th May 1855 I bought 210 American eagles—the entry is in my own writing—I gave 210l 13s for them—it was from 9 o clock to half past—I do not recollect the person it was a man and he was alone—I paid him in gold by his desire but as I had not the money to pay him in the house I sold them in the trade got bank notes for them and changed the notes at the Bank of England—that occupied about half an hour and I found him remaining in the shop and gave him the gold—I have a slight recollection of him he was rather a tall man and looked as if he had been travelling he looked tired COURT Q Did you tell him the reason that you detained him A I told him that I should go and get the gold RUDOLPH PROMMELL I am a money changer at No 37 Haymarket the third house on the right hand side near the top—I have got my book here produced On 16th May 1855 in the morning I bought 200 American eagles for 203l 6s 8d —I paid by this cheque produced on the Union bank branch No 4 Pall-mall East Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q How long did the transaction of the sale of this money take A Not more than ten minutes—I hardly remember anything of the transaction—I do not remember whether conversation took place about the sale—I recollect nothing but the sale ALEXANDER WHITE I am manager of the Union bank Charing-cross branch Pall-mall East—I cashed this cheque on 16th May 1855 in English sovereigns MARY ANN PORTER I am the wife of James Porter of No 13 Harleyford-road Vauxhall—I saw a man at the Mansion-house who went by the name of Agar—he took apartments of me in the name of Adams in the beginning of Oct two years ago he had a female with him who was called Mrs Adams—I have frequently seen Pierce there as a visitor to Agar in the name of Peckham—they remained there about seven weeks—Peckham came about twice the first week and afterwards more frequently—he very frequently stopped half the day but sometimes not so long—Agar brought the furniture and as far as I know it was his—it was taken away in a van—Peckham went with them—I do not know where it was removed to they did not tell me—they moved away the week before Christmas JOHN HONNOR I live at Walnut-tree-walk Lambeth and have known Pierce four or five years—I knew him there—Walnut-tree-walk adjoins Lambeth-walk—I remember his applying to me to dress a dark wig for him it was nearly black—I did it and returned it to him—I remember his leaving the neighbourhood and going somewhere else—it was a month or five weeks before that that I dressed the wig for him Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q When was it A At the latter end of 1854 it might be about Nov —I have dressed very few wigs since that FANNY BOLAN KAY Some years ago I was an assistant at the refreshment bar at the Tunbridge station and while there was acquainted with Burgess who introduced me to Agar that was in 1853 some time after which I became intimately acquainted with Agar and had a child by him—I lived with him at several places and in Dec 1854 went to live with him at Cambridge-villas Shepherd s-bush—before that I had seen Pierce in Agar s company in Harleyford-road Vauxhall and at Greenwich where I lived and at Tooley-street at the Green Man public house I think it was—I have seen them very often together and taking meals and refreshments together—so far as I saw they were well acquainted with each other—I did not see Burgess in Agar s company from the time he introduced me till we went to live at Shepherd s-bush—Pierce went by the name of Peckham—on 7th May 1855 my child left me to be weaned Charlotte Painter was then a servant of ours—one Sunday a fortnight after that I went to see the child—I remember Mrs Bessel s death our next door neighbour she died on 18th May 1855—it was after that that I went to see my child—on the Tuesday or Wednesday night before that Agar was absent all night—he was away the week after and a few days before—I saw him next day in the afternoon part—I cannot say exactly the time—he came with Pierce in a cart they had two bags with them—I think it was two—they carried them into the washhouse—I did not see them opened—after their return Pierce was there generally every day—after 21st May he and Agar were in the back room first floor—I looked into that room once when they were there together and saw that they had got the stove out and a very bright fire in the chimney—when I opened the door they both ran to it and shut it but I do not think they said anything to me—before that they had been much in the washhouse but I do not know what they had been doing I never went in while they were there—sometimes they were there for the course of the morning and I heard them hammering very often—they also brought into the house shooting bags made of drab leather and one black one—when I peeped into the room up stairs I heard a loud noise a furnace it was like the roaring of a large fire—I heard that going on for several days—I saw what appeared to me to be square pieces of stone brought down from that room by Pierce one end was in a pail and the other he held with a duster—after I had heard that noise they came down to their dinner and their meals very hot and very dirty—I inquired what they were doing and they said Leather apron weaving —they gave no other answer but that—I have heard them speak of Burgess and of Tester—I have gone into the room after that noise has ceased the stove has been replaced and blackened and the floor burnt in a few places—about the time that my child was weaned they wore the fashionable capes shortish cloaks Agar had his about two months before my child was weaned—I never saw Pierce looking otherwise in respect of the colour of his hair than he does now—I have seen him with more hair about his face but his own hair I believe—some short time before Agar s arrest he left me and I remained at Cambridge Villas a short time—he went to Kilburn but I did not at that time know that he was there—he came to see me before I heard that he was arrested the child was not with me at that time he was at Rotherhithe with a cousin of Agar s—after I had left Cambridge Villa I saw Agar at St George s-road the day before his arrest before that I had not seen him for a considerable time—after he went away I remained in lodgings in St George s-road for some time Pierce provided the money for that up to January—I cannot say how much he gave me it was different sums he was to have allowed me 1l a week but he did not do that—I went to live at his house in January and remained till the latter part of April the child was with me—I left on account of words with Pierce—while I was at his house there were two trunks of Agar s there there were his clothes in them and a box of tools I do not think there was anything else—I saw no money which I knew belonged to him—I saw his watch there and a set of shirt studs and a diamond ring but no money or notes—I have seen Pierce with a great deal of gold before I went to live at his house he had a little bag of sovereigns about this size—he once told me that he asked Agar to lend him a sovereign and Agar would not sometimes he said he could get money out of him and sometimes he could not—he has only once told me that he had asked Agar to lend him small sums of money that was during the early part of the time that I was at Cambridge-villas—Pierce asked me to lend him a shilling when I was at Greenwich in 1854—previous to the gold robbery Agar used to sell his old clothes to Pierce I suppose he sold them I have seen Pierce take the old clothes away and have heard them making a bargain for them—I have seen notes as well as gold in Pierces possession after the robbery I cannot tell to what amount I have seen a roll of notes in his hand—after I left his house in April I had no means of support and made application to Pierce for money I got it and I applied again and got it I applied to him again and was refused—after that I saw Mr Weatherhead the Governor of Newgate and made a communication to him I afterwards saw Mr Rees and made a communication to him Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q Might I ask you without being impertinent how old you are or believe yourself to be A 25—I left the Tunbridge station in 1852 I was dismissed—it was not for anything dishonest I am quite sure of that—at that time I went to my mother s to my home—I have not lived with other men besides Agar I will swear that—I have known a person named Tress I do not consider that my conduct has been improper with him at all—I know a person named Hart—I knew him perhaps six months after I left Tunbridge—I did not live with him nor was I constantly in his company—he used to come up to town once a fortnight or three weeks—he did not stay with me—he used not to give me money—I will not swear that but for no improper purpose—he has given me money a sovereign or two sovereigns sometimes—he is no relation of mine—he is perhaps about thirty years of age—Mr Tress has given me money not in the same way—he gave me 5l once—that was after I was dismissed—I do not know what they dismissed me for at Tunbridge—I do not know what complaint it was I had done no harm—I wanted to go home that was the commencement of it—I had a very comfortable situation there 12l a year and my board and lodging—I was not dismissed on account of improprieties with men I have not said so before the Magistrates—I did not speak to Hart until I had left Tunbridge station—I know a gentleman named Bill Barber—he has not given me any money—he was under guard—I did not keep company with him—I do not know whether he is alive or dead but I am quite sure he never gave me any money—Tress is not a relation of mine—I cannot say how old he is he is elderly—I stayed at my mother s until the Nov following I should think—I think I left Tunbridge in April—when I left my mother s I went to Johnson-street Somers Town—I worked at Crosse and Blackwell s in Soho-square—it was not then that Mr Hart called to see me it was at my mother s—she lived in London—he never called to see me anywhere but in London—he never gave me a sovereign in my mother s presence he never saw my mother—after I left Johnson-street I went to Brighton with Agar I was acquainted with him in Johnson-street—I did not know Agar s various names I mean that I did not know him by the name of Agar only by the name of Adams—he left me twice—that was not on account of my drunken habits that I am aware of—he did not allege that as the reason that he left me—I was not in the habit of getting tipsy Q Will you swear that your child was not registered in the name of Agar A I knew it when he was registered he was two years old on 7th July last—in 1854 I knew Agar s real name—Adams and Agar are the only two names I ever knew him by—I know a person named Hodges he never visited me—I have been in his company but not for a very long time—he used to give me money not less than a sovereign at a time—while I was at Pierce s I was out all night for two nights—it was not three nights—I have not been brought home there tipsy—I did not have a quarrel with Pierce on account of my drunken habits it was on account of a letter I had from Agar and I left the house—I will not swear that I have never been brought home drunk to Pierce s—I do not recollect being brought home drunk in a wheelbarrow to Shepherd s-bush—it might have happened—I should not think it could have happened more than once—I did not hear of something of the kind afterwards—I have not been down to Portland Island at all where Agar was—I have been supported by the Company since the disclosure which I chose to make—they do not allow me anything I get my food and lodging but not my clothes—I do not exactly know how long they have done so but I suppose it is since last Oct two or three months—I knew that Pierce was what is called a betting or sporting man—I have not seen money in his possession which he has stated in my presence was won by racing—I never saw him with a betting book—I never saw him making books up in the presence of his wife—I will not undertake to say that the amounts which I have received are not as much as 80l but I do not think it Mrs Pierce did not say in my presence that I had—I will venture to swear it is not 100l —Mrs Pierce has not frequently complained of my drunken habits she has told me that it was a pity that I should do so but merely in a friendly way she never had occasion to complain of me in her house Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q You said that Burgess introduced you to Agar where was that A At a public house in Tooley-street I think it was the Green Man—as near as I can remember Agar was in the room when I went in with Burgess—I do not remember Agar making inquiry about some luggage—I lived with Agar nearly two years—from the time I was introduced to him to the time I was before the Magistrate I never saw Burgess—I knew him as a guard—Agar lived at Paddington when he was taken into custody—I did not know that he was living with Emily Campbell till after he was convicted MR SERJEANT SHEE Q You have been asked whether Tress and Hodges gave you money and you say that they did have you any objection to state what it was for was it for any improper intimacy with you A No—Hart made honourable proposals to me after I left Tunbridge—I had not spoken to him at Tunbridge—I can hardly tell how long I continued under that engagement—it was while I was under that engagement and after my mother s death that he gave me money—the letter that I quarrelled with Pierce about and which I received from Agar was about money matters—Pierce said that Agar never had any money that he was mad he saw Agar s letter and so did his wife—I never heard of a sum of 3 000l Consols given by Agar to Pierce to be settled on me to provide for me and my child Pierce told me he had no money—the second part of the letter which caused the quarrel was talked of between me and him he wrote it from Pentonville he told me I was to buy the two children Pierce s boy and his boy two silver cups and several other things—he said what I was do in the letter but I had no money to buy the things he wanted a geography and several things and Mrs Pierce proposed sending him an old geography of one of her daughter s—Agar said that Pierce was to give me the money and I told Pierce so and his wife too—since X was first examined I hove been living in the house of a police inspector Thornton—I have had money but I have been supported and my child COURT Q Have you ever heard of 3 000l Consols said to have been provided for you by Agar A I never heard anything of it since By the permission of the Court Mr Wontner Pierce s solicitor stated that Agar had 3 000l in the Three per Cents which had been a long time standing in his name that he Mr Wontner had his instructions to sell it out that it realized 2 700l that a number of payments had to be made out of it and that Agar directed him by a written order to hand over the balance 2 500l to Pierce which he did that on subsequently asking Pierce if he had invested the money he replied that he had in Turkish bonds and that he had traced the notes handed to Pierce and found that they corresponded with the purchase of Turkish bonds MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE to Edward Agar Q Did you hear of the loss of the key on board the Folkestone packet A Pierce communicated that to me stating that he had heard it from Teeter—to the best of my belief I was not on the packet on the very night that it was lost—I did not hear of it being lost till Pierce communicated it to me CHARLOTTE PAYNTER I live at No 8 Southampton-street Vauxhall I am fifteen years old—at one time I lived with a Mr and Mrs Adams in the Harleyford-road—I have seen the man Agar who has just left the Court—he is the person that I then lived with as Mr Adams—I was not long in their service in Harleyford-road about two or three months—I was there when they moved—it was very cold weather when they moved—it was about Christmas time—they moved to Cambridge-villas—during the time I was with them in the Harleyford-road I saw Pierce there—I have not often seen him there—he came to see Adams—he was there at the time of the removal—the furniture was moved in a van—Pierce helped to move the things out—I slept at home at that time and went there to look after the child—I did not accompany them to Cambridge-villas—T went there to live with them—I was a good while in their service there—I remember hearing of the death of a Mrs Bessell next door to us—I had been there two or three months before Mrs Bessell died—I saw Pierce at Cambridge-villas as I had done before—he used to come there oftener than to the other place—I was mostly out with the child in the day time—I slept in the house at Cambridge-villas in the back room up stairs—Mr and Mrs Adams slept in the front room—there is a washhouse at the back of the house—I have known Pierce to be there along with Agar—I had no opportunity of seeing what was going on in the washhouse while they were there—I did not hear anything—I did not hear any noise—sometimes they were there all day—I remember going to the washhouse once and not being able to get in—Agar and Pierce were in there then—I knocked at the door and Agar said I could not come in—I did not hear any noise at any time when Agar and Pierce were on the premises—I saw two boxes in the washhouse one was a green one and the other a white one—that is the green box looking at the one produced —when they were not in the washhouse I could get in—I noticed a vice fixed there—I saw one bag there a drab one like that the leather produced —it had one long strap to it—I saw Agar once come into the back parlour with that bag and put it on a chair—I think that was just before Mrs Bessell died—I cannot tell whether there was anything in the bag—I had not to move or to lift it—there was a common stove in the room where I slept that continued there as long as I remained—when I used to clean the washhouse I used to posh the boxes along to sweep underneath them—they appeared to be heavy Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q Are you quite sure about the time that you left do you recollect a child of Mrs Bessell s dying A Yes I did not leave before that—I left after Mrs Bessell died—I have given my evidence before—I did not notice Pierce doing any carpentering work or anything of that kind at any time—he helped to move the goods MARY ANN WILDE I lived as servant with Mr and Mrs Bessell I was living there when Mrs Bessell died—I left about three weeks after her death—I slept in the back room up stairs—Mr and Mrs Adams lived next door—from the window of my bedroom I could see the window of Mr Adams s washhouse—I could not see into the washhouse so as to see what anybody was doing in it—I have seen Mr Adams go into it not often I cannot say how many times—I have seen Agar—he is the man I call Adams—I once saw another man go into the washhouse with him—I recollect Mr Bessell borrowing a hammer once from Mr Adams—I fetched it—I have heard a hammering noise in the washhouse when Adams has been there—I used to hear it frequently Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q Do you know Charlotte Paynter who was servant to Mr and Mrs Adams A Yes—I remember Mrs Bessell s death she died on 18th May 1855 a child of hers died before that—I did not know whether it was two or three months before or more I cannot say for certain—Paynter did not leave before Mrs Bessell s child died I do not know whether she left before Mrs Bessell died—I have not been spoken to on this subject since I was examined before the Magistrate—Paynter left after Mrs Bessell died she left about a month before I did—Lam sure Paynter left after Mrs Bessell died—I recollect something that happened after she died—I was at one time under the impression that was before she died but something brought it to my mind I recollect showing her something after Mrs Bessell died—Mr Bessell was not in the habit of hammering much he put up the clothes lines in the garden—he did not hammer at anything else in the garden I only borrowed the hammer once Mr Adams lent it me at once ZACCHEUS LONG I live at No 5 Crown-terrace Haverstock-hill On 18th Dec 1854 Pierce took the house No 4 of me and he terminated his tenancy on 18th June 1855 and then went to live at No 3 JOHN CARTER I am a beer retailer at Camden Town The prisoner rented a house of me in Crown-terrace No 3—he took it on 18th May 1855 and went into it on 4th June—he remained there about a month WILLIAM ELLIS WOOD I am a cab proprietor residing in Hawley-mews Hawley-street Camden-town I drive one of my own cabs No 3016—I remember being out with my cab in the spring of 1855 and being called by some man and driving to somewhere near the Prince of Wales it was about 7 or half past 7 o clock in the evening—I stopped about 200 or 300 yards from Crown-terrace at the corner of the high road—the man who had called me then went away towards Crown-terrace he afterwards returned with another man they had two or three bags with them—I cannot swear which one I think was leather and two carpet bags—they ordered me to drive to the Brighton station—when I got over London bridge they stopped me by the Bridge Hotel on the right hand side—one of the men was I should say four or five inches taller than the other—when we got to the Bridge Hotel one got out and went towards the station or towards Tooley-street the one who remained in the cab ordered me to St Thomas s-street—I went there and stopped against Guy s Hospital—I was told to pull up there—the men had mantles of some description they had not got them on when they went in they were on their arms then but they placed them on when they got out at least one man did—I could not hear anything that passed inside as I went along I merely felt the action of the cab was very different to what it out to be as if somebody was standing up or moving about—I never felt the bags and could not form any opinion whether they were heavy or light—the man who got out of the cab was away I suppose a quarter or half an hour—when he returned they ordered me to drive back again to where I had come from—when I got up to Hampstead-road I was ordered to turn up towards the Mother Shipton—I did so and they discharged me there and went away with their bags—that is about 200 or 300 yards from Crown-terrace—there are two ways by which you can go to Crown-terrace those are the two ways I have mentioned—I saw the men again I cannot say whether it was a week afterwards or it might not be so long they came and fetched me off the rank then near Chalk Farm I was not on the rank the first time—it was the same man that fetched me the shorter man—he took me to the same place went away and brought another man with him and the same luggage—I think it was the same person that he had fetched on the former occasion but I cannot swear to that—the two were of different heights—I cannot swear that the tall man was the same but I know the shorter man that hired me was—I drove them then to St Thomas s-street on St Thomas s Hospital side—I stopped there and the shorter man got out—I noticed the same sort of action of the cab that time—they seemed to be rustling or moving about in the cab as if they were looking out or something—after the shorter man had been away about half or three-quarters of an hour he returned they had some conversation and then they ordered me back again—on that occasion they had cloaks on their arms when they got in—I then went to the Prince of Wales-road on the Hampstead-road side—I was ordered to set them down at the other end—they got out there and took their luggage away I could not carry it because you cannot get down that road—that is about 200 yards from Crown-terrace—I saw them again it might be a week after but I cannot remember how long it was—the one man fetched me again from the rank the short man the same that had fetched me on the two former occasions—he took me to the same the Hampstead-road the Prince of Wales s corner left me and fetched the same man I think as before but I could not swear as to that he was of the height of the man that had come on the former occasions—they brought their luggage and cloaks just as before—they told me to drive to St Thomas s-street in the Borough—I did so—I pulled up I think on the St Thomas s Hospital side—the short one got out and went away he seemed to bend his way to the left as if he was going towards Tooley-street I do not know whether there is any way to the station that way—on that occasion I lifted one of their carpet bags it was heavy it weighed I should say a quarter of a cwt or more—the man returned to the cab the third time got in and ordered me back to where I had come from—I should say this was the latter end of April or the beginning of May it was somewhere about that time it was always dark when we returned in the evening Q Did they appear to you to be equals or that one was a person of more authority than the other A One appeared to me like a valet to the other the shorter one always appeared to me as if he was a valet—the short man generally gave me directions where to go JOSEPH CARTER I live at No 143 Grove-street Camden-town I drive a cab and have done so for twenty years I remember being hired by two men at Camden-town—from the time I first spoke about it which is nearly two months ago it was about fifteen or sixteen months it might have been more—Pierce was one of the men and Agar was the other—it was in the evening part—they both came together I was on the rank in High-street Camden-town—they brought some bags with them two if not three by the way they put them into the cab they appeared to me to be heavy because the cab rather sounded at the bottom—they got in and desired me to drive St Thomas s-street in the Borough I pulled up on the left hand side at the bottom—I believe there is a way there to the arch of the railway terminus—Agar got out of the cab and the other one remained—Agar went to the left towards the arch—he was gone half an hour—when he returned I heard him say to Pierce It is not a going down to-night —he then got into the cab—I drove them up to the top on the near side and I believe they had a glass of ale one of them had I know—they then ordered me to drive them to the Mother Shipton—they got out there—one got out first and went into the public house into the doorway—they took out the bags and paid me my fare—when I was crossing the road I looked round and saw them both going along Prince s-terrace towards Crown-terrace they had their bags with them—I did not take any notice of the way in which they were dressed—I had seen Pierce before up and down Camden-town—I have seen Agar and Pierce both together but not to know them to have anything to do with them before that time—I have seen them coming along together and pass the rank in High-street Camden-town which is my usual place of standing and has been for the last twenty years Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q What time in the day do you say it was that your cab was ordered A It was evening part towards 5 or 6 o clock or it might have been a little later—it was not as late as 9 o clock I am quite certain—I did not hear of the gold robbery at any time I swear that I never heard a word of it no further than I heard of a gold robbery but not to know that I had anything to do concerning it I have heard people talking about it—I was first discovered as a witness in this case on the Friday before I gave notice at Scotland-yard—I did not go down to the Mansion-house twice before I was examined—I was not examined the first day I went there—I was there one day before—during those days I did not see Pierce and Agar brought in neither of them saw them standing at the bar after I went in before the Lord Mayor—they had not been pointed out to me before—the first time I saw them since I gave information was standing in the dock at the Mansion-house charged with this offence—I did not read Agar s evidence—I swear that—I never talked about it not a word—I heard them talk about his coming forward but I never heard his evidence nor heard any talk about it—the persons I drove in my cab had no cloaks at least I did not take notice of that—I was asked and I said I did not see any JOHN PACKER KNIGHT re-examined I have been at the place which the cabmen have described near St Thomas s Hospital—there are two ways from that place up to the station—there are two sets of steps one leads from Joiner-street up to the Brighton station and the other from Tooley-street up to the Greenwich side of the station MR BODKIN to FANNY BOLAN KAY Q Do you remember Pierce at any time being lame A Yes he had the lumbago that was during the time I was at Cambridge-villas MR SERJEANT PARRY Q Have you ever mentioned that fact before to-day A Not that I know of JAMES CLEMENTS In May June and July 1855 I kept a coffee-shop in High-street Camden-town adjoining the Southampton Arms near the turnpike—I left that shop last July twelve months—some time before that I remember two persons coming to my house one evening—I cannot say exactly how long before it was but I should think between two and three months one was rather shorter than the other—they brought a carpet bag I believe with them—one of them went away and stopped for some time about an hour I cannot say exactly—when he came back they took the bag and went away and I saw no more of them—I did not see whether they had a cab or not JOHN ALLDAY I live at Newbury Mews Haverstock-hill which is about half a quarter of a mile from Crown-terrace—I found some shot in Prince s-terrace that leads from the Maldon road not a stone s throw from Crown-terrace—a person going from Crown-terrace to Kentish-town or in that direction would go along the place where I found the shot it was strewn along the road by the side of the kerb—I picked up about a double handful and a lot more boys picked up some besides me—I cannot recollect when this was it is a good while ago—I left school three years ago—it was a good while after I left school—there were two or three sizes of shot looking at some in one of the bags produced —there were some the size of this and some might be a little larger EMMA MAY I now reside at Mr Holden s No 18 London-street Greenwich I formerly lived as servant with Mrs Thomas when she kept the Marquis of Granby at New-cross—I lived there for five years and a half—I left in Feb two years come next month—I know Burgess he was in the habit of coming to the Marquis of Granby—he lived near there—I know Pierce he also frequented that house—they came there a great many times—I cannot say how often—they used to go to the bar parlour—that was where the general run of customers went—when that was full they used to go into the next room that was a public room as well—they used to come in the morning between 11 and 12 o clock and in the evening between 7 and 8 o clock—they did not very often come together they did sometimes Q Have you known either of them come when the other was in the house before him A Yes sometimes Pierce and Agar but I never knew their names—I used to know them by sight—I knew Agar—I saw him last a goodish bit before I left—I did not know that his name was Agar then I have heard it since—I saw him at the Mansion-house—he used to come to the house with Burgess and Pierce—he used to come as often as the others Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q It is a railway house is it not frequented very much by the railway men A No there are not a great many come there—I knew where Burgess lived he lived at New-cross—when they came in they used to have a glass of beer or something to drink they used generally to drink half-and-half—they came and drank like other customers very moderately—I objected to that—the rooms I speak of are the public rooms used by the customers—if they went from one room that was full very likely the other was half full they would be in the presence of ten or twelve persons Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q When did you first say that you knew Agar by sight A I had been there a good while before I took any notice of them coming—I never heard Agar s name—I have seen Agar Burgess and Pierce together a good many times—I cannot say how long ago—I should think I saw them about six or eight months before I left—I left two years come next month WALTER STEARN I keep the White Hart public house St Thomas s-street Borough I know Pierce and Burgess—I have known them from seven to eight years I should think—previously to May 1855 they had been in the habit of frequenting my house separately and together—I do not think I had seen Agar previously to May 1855—I cannot remember the time that I knew him—I am not aware that I saw him at my house after the middle of May 1855—I have seen him at my house but I do not know the dates or the times I should think it was not since May 1855 but I am not sure—I remember hearing of the robbery I cannot say whether it was before I heard of the robbery or after—I have seen him with Pierce and Burgess two or three times—they have been together taking refreshment not long together at a time a very short time—I believe I have seen them all three together—there have been other persons in the house at the time—I remember in Feb last a parcel being given to me by my servant—I saw Burgess a day or two afterwards I think and he asked me if I had a parcel for him—I said I had and produced it—he opened it while I was in the room I saw that it contained notes—he at the same time gave me 500l all in notes and consulted me as to what should be done with it—I advised him to deposit it with a banker—he objected to that and I told him I would go up to my brewers Messrs Reid s and ask them if they would receive the money—he consented to do that—I took the money to Reid s and saw Mr Smith their cashier and left the money with him—I afterwards received some interest upon it from Messrs Reid I left it with my barmaid and she handed it to Burgess with the book—this produced is the book and this is the entry on 19th Feb COURT Q Do you know that you deposited the money on the same day as is dated there A Yes SARAH THOMPSON I am barmaid to Mr Stearn and was so in Feb last—I remember giving Mr Stearn a parcel containing bank notes—I received that parcel from a person named Lee—as near as I can recollect it was addressed to Mr Burgess—I afterwards gave Burgess 8l 1s 1d for interest—I received that from Mr Stearn—I showed Burgess this book at the time I gave him the money—Burgess did not say anything to me about the parcel when I paid him the 8l—I gave him the money saying that Mr Stearn had left it and showed him the book—I had not any conversation with him about the parcel before I received it from Lee nor after—I never spoke to him about the parcel nor he to me RICHARD LEE I am a stockjobber of Charlotte-street Camberwell—I have known Burgess eight or nine years Pierce about eight years and Tester four years perhaps—I was formerly in the employment of the South Eastern Company as clerk—at that time Pierce was ticket porter to the Company and Burgess was guard—I have been in the habit of using Stearn s public house and have seen them there occasionally—at the beginning of Feb 1856 Burgess saw me at Mr Stearn s and asked me if I knew anything about Turkish bonds—I said Yea —he asked me the price—I referred to the paper and found that it was 8l or something like that and he gave me instructions to buy 500l stock—I went to Hutchinsons the broken and asked them to do it for me and they did—I took a note of the purchase to Burgess at Steam s—I bought for a day or two on because being 500l it was not so easily got as 1 000l —the consideration altogether was 407l 10s —I went to New Cross and got the money from Mrs Burgess—Mr Burgess asked me when I should want the money I said It does not matter for a day or two and he said I will leave it at home ask Mrs Burgess for it and I did so—405l of it was in notes and 2l 10s in gold—I paid the same notes to Hutchinsons I wrote the numbers of them but left it at New Cross at Mrs Burgess s for safety—I wrote my name on the notes—these three 100l notes and eight 10l notes are part of what I received from her and paid to Hutchinsons—my writing is on them the notes were Nos 45421 45423 and 45424 for 100l each 9th Jan 1855 and eight 10l notes Nos 21560 to 21567 all dated 5th June 1855 Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q You say that you saw the prisoner at Stearn s do you mean the whole of these three men A No—I never saw Tester there—I never said that I saw them all three there—I know nothing of Tester being employed on the railway excepting that he was clerk MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE to J P KNIGHT Q What were Tester s hours of work A From 9 o clock in the morning to 5 in the afternoon—it would occasionally happen that he would stay after that time but those were his regular hours MR LEE Cross-examined by MR GIFFABD Q You say that you have known Burgess seven or eight years A Yes—he has always borne the character of an honest man—I had 405l in notes from Mrs Burgess—407l 10s I obtained from her in all—I paid the whole at that time—you have had the notes from the banker s and you will find my endorsement on them—I remember five weeks after the Turkish bonds were purchased that I sold them again for him for 464l 7s 6d —he obtained a profit of 57l 10s on that transaction—at the time he bought them he said that he understood that they would rise 20 per cent and they did rise 22—I sold them at 93l MR BODKIN Q When was it you sold them A Some time in the beginning of Feb —I had a cheque for them on 15th Feb —I employed Hutchinsons to sell them and I had half commission—they gave me a cheque on Curtis s and I got it cashed there put the notes in an envelope and went over the water and left them at Mr Stearn s for Burgess—I gave them to the young woman Thompson the same notes RICHARD ADYE BAILEY I am a clerk in the bank note office Bank of England I produce six 100l notes paid to the name of Edgington on 28th May 1855—I did not pay them myself I know it by the books— The bank books were here sent for —I know of the return of those notes—I have a 100l note of 9th Jan 1855 No 45420 which was returned on 14th Sep 1855 it has the name of Tester on it—I did not see it at the time it was returned—I have taken it off the file of that day—the Christian name is torn off—here is part of a G and underneath is For C Page —I have also a 100l note No 45422 dated 9th Jan which came in on 11th Sep 1855 it has on it Wm Geo Tester 11 Sep 6 St Jermyn s Villas Lewisham —I only know for what it was exchanged by examining the bank books somebody else can tell you—the next is a 10l note No 44525 9th Jan which came in on 21st Nov 1855 with the name on it of Geo Raffan 72 Warren-street Fitzroy-square and Henry Fisher —there is also R B for Royal British—the three other 100l notes which have been put in already were taken off the file they have the name of J Burgess on them—I do not know of my own knowledge who paid them in but I know that they came in through Robarts and Co because I know the way in which they mark their notes—eight 10l Bank of England notes Nos 221860 to 221867 inclusive were paid in on 9th Jan 1856 they are part of the same parcel as the three 100l notes I have just mentioned—I remember a 100l note No 42255 being taken off the file it had the name of Stearn on it Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q I understand you are able by the bank books to ascertain when the notes were paid in A Yes—of these two 100l notes with Tester s name on them No 45420 was paid in on 14th Sept 1855 and No 45422 was changed over the counter on 11th Sept 1855—I can find out when these notes were issued—there is nothing on the notes to tell me there never is but it was subsequent to the date of course the date is 9th Jan 1855 Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRY Q Have you got a 100l note there with the name of Raffan upon it A Yes J P KNIGHT re-examined This G or Geo Tester on this 100l note 45420 is I believe Tester s writing as is also this Wm Geo Tester 6 St Jermyn s Villas Lewisham on No 48422—he lived at Lewisham I forget the exact address Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Are you quite satisfied of that A Yes—the two signatures resemble each other—I know the writing very well from his being in the same office with me and I saw his writing daily—there is no concealment about it it is quite the style GEORGE RAFFAN I am a porter in the neighbourhood of Fitzroy-square—I know Pierce—he requested me to change a 100l Bank of England note or to get it changed—I do not know the number of it—I wrote my name on it and took it to a person named Fisher in Cranbrook-street who gave me smaller notes for it—this produced is it here is my name on it in my writing—I do not know Fisher s writing—about twelve or thirteen months ago from this time Pierce asked me to go to the Bank of England it was somewhere about the same time they might be a month apart—I took sundry notes and brought away 200 sovereigns for them he told me to go over to the far end and I should see a little desk and I could write my name on one of them—I did so and got the money in gold for the notes Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT PARRT Q At that time were you in Pierce s employment A Yes—I received 30s a week from him as wages—I was in his employment thirteen or fourteen months or it might be fifteen I cannot say to a day or two—it was not two years—I left him about June or July last—it was in the beginning of 1855 and during a portion of 1856 that I was in his employ—he kept a betting house and hail considerable betting transactions—from time to time I have been In the habit of changing notes for him frequently and giving him notes taken in business from the gentlemen with whom he bet—I took them in business and gave them to him—I once changed the notes for gold and once for smaller notes—I never took notes to the bank at any other time—I have known considerable sums of money in his possession from time to time arising from betting transactions—I have seen as much as 1002 or 200l notes in husband and more derived from betting transactions—he used to go to the races MR SERJEANT SHEE Q When was it that he had money derived from betting A From the beginning of last year 1856 about Feb but not previous in Panton-street—I had done business before for him—since Feb I have seen the most extensive bets I have seen as much as 200l —I cannot say when it would be in 1855 and about the spring time—the first place that I knew where he lived was in Crown-terrace—I have seen him win notes—I was an agent for him in getting—I never saw any money in Crown-terrace—he was living there when I saw the notes—but I did not see them there—he did not tell me how he got them—I never took his clothes out of pledge previous to the spring of 1855 I took a pair of boots out if you term them clothes—that was early in the spring of 1855—I cannot call to mind what they were pledged for Mr SERJEANT PARRY Q In 1856 were not you engaged in making up a betting book to the extent of some hundreds for Pierce A No I was not so engaged at a place called the Boar s Head—I made up a book when a horse called Saucebox won the St Ledger—I cannot say exactly the extent—it was something like 100l —that was in Sept 1855 JOHN SMITH I am a cashier to Reid and Co brewers On 19th Feb a deposit was made there by Mr Stearn I took the number of the notes and wrote my name on them—these two 100l notes Nos 39538 and 42255 have the name of Stearn on them in my writing and so have these 50l notes Nos 19324 21858 26249 26711 and 28489 also these two 20l notes Nos 73624 and 75625 and this 10l note No 21558 ALFRED JOSEPH YOUNG I am a stock and share broker I know the witness Edward Agar—on 17th Aug 1854 he employed me to purchase some Spanish bonds for him in the name of Robert Adams—I bought for him 765l Spanish Three per Cent stock—I delivered them to him in two bonds one of 510l and the other of 255l — Upon the witness being asked the number of these bonds MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE objected on the ground that it was giving evidence of the contents of a document which could not be done without proof of its loss MR BARON MARTIK was clearly of opinion that the evidence was admissible not to prove the contents of a document but for the purposes of identification in the same way that proof of the identity of my chattel or the number of a cab or the brand of oxen would be receivable he had in a case on the Western Circuit allowed a party to describe the endorsement on a deed for the purpose of identifying it and the Court of Queen s Bench had held that decision to be correct MR JUSTICE WILLES had also no doubt that the evidence was receivable —The No of the 510l bond was 1658 and of the 255l bond No 1084—in the month of Nov I purchased another bond for him of 255l stock No 2675 Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q I suppose he paid you the money A Yes MR SERJEANT SHEE Q You gave those bonds to Agar A Yes WILLIAM SINCLAIR ST GEORGE FORRESTER I am a stock broker in Angel-Court Throgmorton-street—I succeeded to the business of Mr William Shaw to whom I had previously been clerk—while I was his clerk the prisoner Tester became a customer of his in share transactions—he was introduced by his father Mr William Tester—I bought for the prisoner Tester 100l consols on 27th June 1855 and in about two months we sold out the whole of it—in June 1856 I purchased for him three Spanish bonds MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Do you mean that by the direction of Tester you purchased anything for him in 1856 A No the only transaction we had for the prisoner was the 100l consols COURT Q Did you ever see Tester A Yes he attended himself to sell out the 100l consols that he had bought MR SERJEANT SHEE Q On 3rd Jan 1856 did you sell out two bonds for Mr William Tester MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE objected to this question MR SERJEANT SHEE proposed to connect the prisoner with the transaction in question but upon the objection being pressed postponed the question BENJAMIN PAGE I am related to the prisoner Tester by marriage I was the holder of this bond looking at it until I gave it up to Mr Rees—it is the property of the prisoner Tester Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Just look at the names on those two 100l notes and tell me whether they are in Tester s hand writing according to your belief or not—you know his hand writing I suppose A I do I should say they were—it is like his ordinary hand-writing—there is no concealment whatever—I received this bond from his father not from him—I only know what his father told me MR SERJEANT SHEE When did you first get possession of it A On 1st Dec 1856—I have seen the prisoner Tester since and have spoken with him respecting that bond—he said his possession of it was perfectly legitimate MR FORRESTER re-examined Looking at the bond I have no recollection of the number of the bond I purchased without referring to my book— referring it corresponds with the entry in my book MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Is the entry in your own handwriting A Yes MR SERJEANT SHEE Q Where did you purchase that bond A It appears to have been bought on 27th Feb 1856—the consideration money given for it was 438l 12s —we sold other Spanish bonds the produce of which was invested in this bond MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Who was it produced to you the bonds that were sold as part payment of that bond A Mr William Tester the father—I think I mentioned before that we never purchased any Spanish bonds for the prisoner MR SERJEANT SHEE Q Then you purchased the bond produced with the proceeds of other bonds sold out by you for Mr William Tester the father A Yes with other bonds which we had orginally bought for Mr William Tester—I have all the entries in my book here—it was the produce of the sale of certain Spanish bonds which he brought to us which were invested in other Spanish bonds active and deferred—on 3rd Jan 1856 we bought for Mr William Tester three bonds of 510l each Nos 5245 22403 and 29923 Q I ask you with what monies you purchased the bonds which you sold for the one produced A Mr Tester brought us some bonds to sell—he give us the bonds—we do not know how he became possessed of them—they were three bonds one of 510l No 1658 and two of 255l each Nos 125 and 1084—Mr William Tester gave me those bonds on 3rd Jan 1856—the sale of those and the purchase of the others were effected at the same time—we afterwards sold the others and with the proceeds this bond was bought Cross-examined by MR SERJEAN BALLANTINE Q How long had you known Mr Tester the elder A I believe he had been in the habit of doing business at the office many years before I came there—he is a man of respectability—I do not know his means at all but we always considered him a highly respectable man a man whose orders we always took—he had never been dealing with Spanish bonds before to my knowledge—Jan 1856 was the earliest date of his dealing with Spanish bonds—he brought the bonds to us on 3rd Jan 1856—I do not know what he is—he resides at Dover WILLIAM COCK TILLEY I am a clerk in the Bank of England On 28th May 1855 I gave six 100l notes for 600 sovereigns—the name of Edginton Duke-street was given when the exchange was made—I do not know the person who gave that name—the Nos of the notes I gave were Nos 45420 to 45425 inclusive all dated 9th Jan ARCHIBALD GRIFFITHS I am a clerk in the Bank of England On 11th Sept 1855 a 100l Bank of England note No 45422 was exchanged with me for smaller notes—when that note was brought to me to be changed it had the name on it that is on it now W G Tester 6 St Jermyn s-villas Lewisham —the Nos of the 10l notes I gave in exchange were Nos 21558 to 21567 inclusive— MR SERJEANT SHEE produced nine of those notes and stated that eight of them had the name of Burgees upon them and the ninth the name of Stearn the tenth note MR BAYLEY stated had not yet been paid in EDWARD NATALI FRANCIS I am a partner in the firm of Edgington and Co of Duke-street The South Eastern Railway Company are occasionally customers of ours very rarely—we carry on business close by the station—I know nothing of the exchange of 600 sovereigns for six 100l Bank of England notes at the Bank of England on 28th May 1855 in the name of our firm RICHARD LEE re-examined I know Pierce—about the middle of March last I got a small Spanish bond from him which I took to Messrs Hutchinson—they sold it for me and gave me a cheque for the amount—I got it cashed at Robarts s and paid the proceeds to Pierce—he gave me no directions afterwards MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE to MR FORRESTER Q What is the value of that bond at 48 per cent A I must have my book again referring —I think the value at 52 discount would be an odd sum I cannot tell it exactly—the Spanish government promises to pay 3 per cent—the nominal value is 1 020l Q I understand you that you received no cash on the transaction except cash realized by the sale of other bonds A I think at the last exchange there might have been a trifling balance of 1l or 2l—the exact sum was 438l 12s —there was no cash passed except just to make up the balance CHARLES COUSINS I am clerk to Messrs Hutchinson and Co stock brokers of Lothbury I sold a Spanish bond for Mr Lee No 2 675—I have here my entry of the sale—it was for 255l Spanish 3 per cents — MR BARON MARTIN did not see the relevancy of this evidence and it was not pursued JOHN CHARLES REES I am solicitor to the South Eastern Railway Company I have conducted the investigation in this matter and am conducting this prosecution—I went to the house at Kilburn-villa on the same day that Piece was taken into custody it has a garden in front and leading from the garden to the street door there is a flight of stone steps—I went down to the basement part of that house—I found a sort of pantry underneath the front steps—I made a search there—I found that the ground had been disturbed against the wall of the pantry furthest from the house underneath the steps—a hole had evidently been dug there at some former time and in place of the clay which was the natural formation of the ground I found that the hole was filled with loose cinders and rubbish there were appearances which enabled me to judge how recently the hole had been filled up in the cinders were fresh leaves and autumn berries and part of the claw of a lobster evidently quite fresh—there were several things found in the house some Turkish bonds to a considerable amount I believe 2 600l or thereabouts some deeds leases securities for money I O U s and promissory notes and things of that sort the officer who has them will give the particulars—several boxes were found—the green tool box which has been produced was found in one of the attics in the same condition that it is now these two pieces of leather were in it—I had previous to this on 22nd Sept been to the house No 3 Cambridge-villas—it was then uninhabited and empty—it was a house of two stories with two rooms below and two above with a small dressing room—I went up to the back room first floor—I found an ordinary stove in the chimney place—I caused it to be removed and behind it found the three fire bricks which have been produced—the chimney was entirely free from soot and had evidently been subjected to a very intense heat—I examined the bricks and found appearances of gold on them—they were exactly in the same state as they are now—I looked at the floor—I found that the boards had been burnt in several places principally in front of the fire place between the fire place and the window—I caused some of the boards to be taken up where the burning was and I Sound several small particles of gold—these are them producing them —they had evidently dropped through the boards on to the ceiling below—at the time I went to Cambridge-villas I had not had any interview with Agar at Portland I had of course before Pierce s arrest—I did not in my interview with Agar say anything to him of what I had discovered at Cambridge-villas nor did he know that I had been to the house—I had an order from the Secretary of State to be permitted to see him—upon the second occasion of my going down he made a statement to me—he had made the statement before I went to the house at Kilburn-villas it was in consequence of that that I went to the cellar as I have described Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q What was the date of your visit to Agar A I cannot give it you exactly—the first visit I think was about the first week in Oct but he made no communication to me at that time—the visit at which he did make a communication was about ten days or a fortnight afterwards or perhaps a little more—I am not quite sure as to these dates—it was in Oct certainly—I was not the solicitor for the South Eastern Railway Company at the time the claim of Mr Abel was first made against them nor in fact at any part of the time—I did not examine any witnesses with respect to the claim of Mr Abel FREDERICK WILLIAMSON I am a detective officer I went to the house in Kilburn Villa—I discovered a box there with some tools in it—it was the green box that has been produced—I do not remember finding the leather in that box—the box with the tools in it was conveyed to Mr Rees office London-bridge on 7th or 8th Nov —it was found on the 5th—I also found there fourteen Turkish three per cent bonds three of 500l each five for 100l and six for 50l and a gold watch and chain—there is a representation of Windsor castle on the face of the watch and the initials E R A on the back—the Turkish bonds were in a tin box with a variety of memorandums and other things—I think the green box was taken to Mr Bees office by Sergeant Smith MR REES re-examined I took the green box from Pierce s to my office and it has been there ever since—it contained these pieces of leather MR SERJEANT PARRY Q Were there some betting-books and I O U s taken from Pierce A Either from Pierce or from his house I do not recollect which FREDERICK WILLIAMSON re-examined There was one betting-book I think MR SERJEANT PARRY submitted that as regarded Pierce the only Count upon which he was called upon to address the Jury was the 3rd charging a simple larceny he was clearly not a servant of the Company at the time of the robbery as alleged in the 1st Count the 2nd Count charging a larceny in a dwelling house could not be supported and as to the 4th charging him as a receiver the evidence if believed pointed quite the other way MR SERJEANT SHEE did not rely upon the 2nd Count but as to the 1st he contended that although Pierce was not in the Company s service at the time of the robbery yet as he was clearly an accessory before the fact under 11th and 12th Victoria c 46 he might be treated in the same way as Burgess and Tester who were the Company s servants and principals in the robbery MR BARON MARTIN was of opinion that the 11th and 12th Victoria did not apply to such a case as the present and that the 3rd Count was the only one which applied to the case against Pierce PIERCE— GUILTY on 3rd Count Aged 40 — Confined Two Years Three Months Solitary BURGESS— GUILTY Aged 35 TESTER— GUILTY Aged 26 Transported for Fourteen Years 
t18570202-304  304 JOHN PAUL was indicted for stealing on 2nd Sept an order for the payment of 378l 15s 6d the property of the guardians of the poor of the City of London Union his masters —2nd COUNT of Thomas Thornton and others his masters MESSRS BODKIN and M INTYRE conducted the Prosecution STEPHEN HOBSON HEATH I am one of the guardians of the poor of the City of London Union The prisoner was assistant clerk to the board of guardians and had been so for many years—his salary was 200l a year and apartments at the Union-office St Mary Axe to live in rent free for himself and family—he was assistant clerk to the board of guardians on 2nd Sept last—I was present at a meeting of the board of guardians on that day—this is the minute book produced —it is not in my handwriting—it is kept by the clerk of the board not the prisoner—this entry of 2nd Sept is in the handwriting of Eldred BENJAMIN GILL ELDRED I was a clerk in the employment of the board of guardians I was so on 2nd Sept These minutes of 2nd Sept are in my writing—I have no doubt I was there on 2nd Sept for I never missed being there but these were not written on 2nd Sept Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q How long had you been connected with this board A About seven years—the prisoner had been in the employment of the board long before that many years Q Do you know the mode in which the board arranged the payment of the different accounts to persons A I think generally speaking they were signed at the board and I did not see them after they went up—the prisoner paid some of the cheques through his own bankers—that was known to the board and to everybody it was known to me some of them but not all certainly—I mean some of the cheques given by the guardians of the Union and he then paid parties by cheques of his own creditors of the Union many of them were not creditors but non-resident householders—I very frequently filled up the cheques whether drawn on the Union bankers or on his private bankers Q After the cheque had been paid into his own bankers which he received from the Union supposing him to pay the money by a cheque of his own were you in the habit of recognizing that system and filling up the body of the cheque A A very great many of them—it would be the prisoner s duty to receive directions as to the course of business he was to pursue from the guardians or from Mr Rowsell who was the representative of the guardians—there were printed papers in 1850 pointing out the duties of all the servants—the duties of the clerks were defined in a printed list—I believe all the servants have been acting under those orders since that time—Mr Thornton was chairman of the board on 2nd Sept 1856—I am not aware that he is here—there was an auditor who attended half-yearly to audit the accounts MR BODKIN Q Have you ever yourself paid in any cheque to the prisoner s private account which had been drawn by the board for the pay-ment of their disbursements A I am not aware that I ever did—the prisoner has not told me that he paid in the cheques of the board and then drew cheques on his private account—I am quite aware that he has paid them he has been in the habit at the end of the quarter more particularly of taking a list printed on the paper of business of certain amounts perhaps sometimes as many as twenty and he drew one cheque for that amount at least I generally drew the cheque—there was one cheque drawn for the board to sign that cheque included several persons accounts—the prisoner would present a list of perhaps twenty items to be paid to different persons generally small accounts and one cheque would be given to him for the whole of those accounts—I generally drew the cheque and it was signed by the guardians at the board—I cannot state what the amounts would be that were included in that cheque they would vary considerably—I think the last two cheques which was soon after the Michaelmas quarter only amounted to 120l odd—the small amounts of which those cheques were composed varied perhaps from 2l or 3l up to 10l —the cheque that I am now speaking of had not reference to payments—there were cheques drawn for the express purpose of non-residents and likewise for the payment of apprenticeships and they were paid by the prisoner in his own cheques MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Did those general cheques amount to many thousands of pounds in the year A I should say decidedly not not to several thousands STEPHEN HOBSON HEATH re-examined I was at the board of guardians on 2nd Sept—the prisoner was acting as assistant clerk to the board of guardians on that day—he was present at the board that day—Mr Rowsell was out of town at that time—I was present when this cheque was given to the prisoner—it was given to him to pay Kingsford and Co one of the contractors for flour to the Union—the whole of it was to be paid to them—he was to pay them that cheque—he had no authority to pay it into his own bankers to his own account—I did not see that cheque again until 17th Dec I then found it in the prisoner s private desk at the house he lived in in St Mary Axe—he had then left the office it was after he had absconded—the returned cheques of the Union would be kept in his office until the audit they might have been kept in his private drawer I do not know Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BALLANTOTE Q How long have you been connected with these guardians of the public money A For twelve months—there are a good many gentlemen connected with the board who have been much longer at it than I have and who I should think know a great deal more about it—I have heard that the prisoner has been a servant of the guardians for twenty years I think—I knew as a guardian what his duties were as well as if I had been there twenty years ago—I know what he did or ought to have done—I certainly did not know of the system of paying the cheques of the guardians into his own bankers and drawing out the sums he wanted to pay persons—I never heard of it I am quite sure if I had I should have proposed his immediate suspension from his office and so would the other guardians—it was never known by the guardians that he did so—I know now that it was his constant habit to do so—it was most certainly done without the authority of the board—Eldred was a clerk of the Union but in consequence of his revealing that he knew of this fact he has been discharged by the board of guardians—he was discharged because he was aware that Mr Paul had used the cheques of the guardians and had not informed the guardians of that fact—I mean used them by appropriating the money to his own use by paying them into his bankers in the first place I am now aware of the fact that accounts have been paid by him over and over again by his own private cheques—he may have paid his own cheques to Messrs Atkinsons to the amount of thousands—I am speaking of matters that I have learned since MR BODKIN Q You have stated that until certain discoveries you were not aware of any payment into his own private account of any sum given him by the guardians A Certainly not nor as far as my knowledge extends were the board aware of it—it was his duty when he received the cheques for the non-resident poor a number of accounts together to get the money for that and pay it to the different accounts—Messrs Smith Payne and Smith are our bankers JOHN ROBINSON GLANVILLE I am a clerk in the Bank of London The prisoner had a private account at our house—on 13th Sept last 443l 15s 6d was paid in to the credit of his account—this cheque for 378l formed a portion of it—when a customer pays money into our bank a credit note is given for it—this produced is one—I believe it to be in the prisoner s handwriting this was handed in with the money—the items of which the amount was composed were 378l 15s 6d 35l and 30l —we stamp all cheques that are paid in—I see our stamp on this cheque—that is put on by some of our clerks after it is paid in WILLIAM SAMUEL FLINDERS I am cashier to Messrs Smith Payne and Smith On 13th Sept I cashed this cheque for the Bank of London JOHN THOMAS ROWSELL In Sept last I was principal clerk to the board of guardians of the London Union and had been so for nearly twenty years this cheque is countersigned by me—it was my practice to countersign cheques which were signed at the board by the members who were present—it was the prisoner s duty to have paid this cheque over to the party for whom it was intended Messrs Kingsford—the prisoner left the office I think on 17th Dec —before that on 27th Nov I had a conversation with him in consequence of an application for payment by Messrs Kingsford—I thought I recollected that a cheque had been signed during my absence from London I found that that had been the case and that it was signed on 2nd Sept and I asked the prisoner for the receipt for the money from Kingsford s—finding that he hesitated I told him that the cheque had been cashed on the 13th—I then left the office for a moment to see by the bankers book whether the 13th was the right date I returned again almost immediately the prisoner then said that it was useless deceiving me he had used the money he implored me to save him from the ruin of disclosure and having a great regard and esteem for him and knowing the estimation and regard in which he had been generally held I was induced to forbear the disclosure at that time—nothing more passed between us that I recollect except that he said he should take care to repay the money—I afterwards paid the money out of my own moneys that was on 6th Dec —we also Lid some conversation as to another cheque which I believe is not before you to-day which he had misappropriated and he told me that that was the whole of his irregularity—I paid the money into Messrs Kingsfords bankers—the prisoner left the office on 17th Dec —I think a search was being made in the office that day by some of the guardians—the prisoner left I think about 4 o clock in the afternoon—I never saw him again until he was in custody which was I think on 31st Dec Cross-examined Q Your duties I believe were defined by a paper published some four or five years ago A Yes they were stated on that paper it was my duty to do a great many things and amongst others to instruct the various officers in their duties—I had very hard work myself—I did a good deal in the instructing line—I do not say I was constantly at it—if any of the officers felt any difficulty they applied to me and I instructed them—if they did not feel any difficulty I gave no instruction—I did not proffer it but only gave it when asked for—I had frequent applications—I frequently instructed Mr Paul—I did not know of his paying the accounts of the Union by cheques on his own bankers I never heard of it—it was among my duties to examine all papers and all Acts of Parliament relating to the poor laws Q This is the part that I wanted to call your attention to referring to a printed paper —you were to keep punctually minutes of the proceedings of the meetings and to keep check and examine all account books and documents A I wish you to understand that that is the whole detail of the duties of the office of clerk if you will look below that you will find that to enable the clerk to perform those duties there are certain officers appointed—all the duties are under the head of myself—I do not consider that it was personally my duty to keep check and examine all accounts that was the duty of the prisoner—he was an acknowledged and confidential clerk if you look below that paper you will find that it was so—I do not say that it was his duty to check his own accounts—it was not my general duty to keep check and examine all account—the responsibility attached to my office was very great and produced a constant wear and tear of mind and body—I say I had not personally to keep check and examine all accounts—the auditor would check the accounts—it was the duty of the auditor to see that each officer at the end of every half year produced his accounts to be examined—I do not see how the auditor should know the arrangements of the office or the mode in which cheques should be given he could easily check it because he had the power of calling any officer before him Q But how should he judge by calling an officer before him suppose for instance that Mr Paul had been drawing cheques on his private bankers to pay the accounts of the Union would that be a matter that the auditor could check A He could check it by the dates of the receipts—he could see that the vouchers and other matters agreed—he would perhaps be able to tell whether that was proper as much as I could—the auditor is a person called in every half year Q Did not the prisoner in this very conversation tell you that he had overpaid Lee s account to the amount of 250l and if you could get that back from Lee it would help to pay the defalcation A He told me so afterwards not during that conversation—it was some days afterwards—I found that was true that he had paid Lee 250l which did not appear to have been drawn by the board—it appeared to me that he had paid Lee 250l out of his own funds—I do not think he told me when he had paid it—it was recently—I understand it was after 13th Sept—I think I asked him how he could satisfy me that that was the case and I afterwards saw a statement from Messrs Lee written by them in which it appeared that that was the case MR BODKIN Q What did you find to be the state of the account with Lee is there money due to them now A We found afterwards that there was money due to Lee upon former accounts—I found on investigating the account that money was due to Lee for which the guardians had drawn cheques—I do not know exactly to what amount—it appeared that he paid money to Lee s account as he pleased disregarding the amounts of the cheques which the guardians had drawn—taking the whole of Lee s account together the sums which the prisoner has paid to them do not amount to the sum for which cheques were drawn by the board of guardians—there is still a balance allowing for the 250l —this paper is a report of the duties of officers drawn up by the direction of the board of guardians for their information—it defines the duties of the prisoner—my duty was the general superintendence— Reads To enable the clerk to perform the above duties and the actual manual labour attendant upon his office he requires the assistance of the assistant clerk Mr Paul and of three other permanent and efficient clerks whose several duties are detailed as follows Assistant clerk Mr John Paul Duties required to attend to the general management and arrangement of the offices and to take the superintendence and control under Mr Rowsell of the several clerks and officers to prescribe their daily duties and to see the same punctually and correctly performed to manage the out relief and general expenditure to see that the several sums paid to the treasurer are duly credited to the accounts of the respective parishes to watch the accounts of the several parishes to see that notices are given for the payment of calls in arrear and to report to the clerk from time to time when the state of the accounts with any parish requires his especial attention to take the management of the accounts of the non-settled and non-resident relief to take the management and regulation of the emigration and shipping cases to attend guardians parish officers and others and to answer and explain all matters relating to the accounts to keep and arrange all accounts and vouchers and to produce the same to the auditor at the half yearly audit to attend the meetings of the board with the clerk for the purpose of giving his assistance and producing papers when required and also for the purpose of making himself acquainted with the business in progress and the mode of conducting the same so that he may be the better able to act for the clerk in case of his illness or temporary absence and generally to assist in performing any of the duties required for carrying on the business of the Union MR SERJEANT BALLANTINE Q Did you not obtain from the board a cheque for 250l on account of Messrs Lee and apply it to partly pay the deficiency arising from these defalcations A Yes believing Mr Paul s statement to me to be correct I did take that cheque and that cheque was cashed I think on 13th Dec on my account which cheque was the cheque that the prisoner requested me to take as belonging to him he having previously paid the money but when I found that he had misrepresented the state of Messrs Lee s account I immediately repaid the 250l to the treasurer of the Union ALFRED KINGSFORD I am clerk and cashier to Thomas and Charles Kingford They supplied the City of London Union with flour—on 6th Dec the sum of 378l 15s 6d was paid into the London and Westminster Bank to our credit from the Union GUILTY Aged 60 — Transported for Fourteen Years There were several oilier indictments against the prisoner Before Mr Justice Wightman and the Fifth Jury

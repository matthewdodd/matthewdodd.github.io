I cannot say no otherwise only as that place was they were in that place Do you mean to state that they were concealed in any place in which a person going to this man in the course of his business would not expect to find cattle - They were in a back place I can say no otherwise You cannot misconceive the purport of this question were they or were they not in that part of his premises in which according to the course of his trade cattle would be found - They were adjoining to his house Is that an answer that an honest man would give respecting a man s liberty for fourteen years were they or were they not I am sure it is a pertinent question in that part of Sillitoe s premises in which any person s cattle in the course of their business would be found - If we had not had an idea we could not have found them I put the question again - I found them in the place where he always puts them as he tells me THOMAS HADEN sworn I am a drover I am servant to Mr Bennett we brought out twenty three score and seventeen some ewes and some lambs my master lives against the five-mile-stone on the Rumford-road I set out at eight on the Sunday night I did not miss any of them on the road after I drove them off separate I told the lots I did not tell them before I came to Smithfield that was about two or a little after then there were three sheep and a lamb missing they were counted by the penn-man he is not here they were delivered up to him about three my master came about three after the penn-man and I told him I wanted three sheep and a lamb he counted them and found them missing I took the sheep in down in the country every man s sheep was marked different I cannot say how many lots there were I saw the sheep at Sillitoe shouse a quarter before five I was there before my master I knew them to be our sheep by the marks the shorn ewe was marked down the side of the neck and touched in the back with oker Do you mean to be accurate as to that - Yes the other was marked on the off side of the neck and touched on the back with red oker one of the others was marked on the head with oker and down the rump one was sheered as I told you first these three were all touched with red oker two were woolled one shorn the lamb was blued right down the face this Abe the prisoner Abraham Jacobs met me at the Globe at Mile-end I had a ewe went very bad and he had a dog and I said if you do not keep your dog away I will knock him down he went to Whitechapel-church and bade me a good night I have seen him before in the market Mr Knowlys What age are you - About nineteen I lived two years with my master once before I came away and I have lived with him about eight months I have eight guineas a year Do you know the nature of an oath - Yes What is the nature of an oath - That I should not swear false that I should not tell a lye Do you know who you apply to for the truth of what you say - I know that I should say the truth and nothing but the truth Who do you call to witness to that truth - I have nobody to witness to the truth Who do you call to witness - Why God Then do not let the fear of losing these eight guineas a year or any thing that your master can say induce you to tell a lye - I would not tell a lye for twenty guineas a year I will not be influenced by any thing if I know it I did not count them at home my master told me there were twenty-three score and seventeen I cannot tell how many sheep and how many lambs nor no man living I cannot tell how many different marks there were You lose sheep occasionally - Yes we do very often They stray you know - They stray or are stole they do not stray in London they are taken away from us I never had a lamb or sheep strayed from me in London in my life I never had none strayed from me I always drive them when my master has any to drive I had two men with me they are not here I was behind them and they were before me Of course they could give as good an account of the cattle as you can - They were only hired men they had not the care of the cattle Abraham is a drover and is employed as such by many people The sheep were in Sillitoe s open back yard - There was no cover over it it was open high pales the people might see out of the window He is a butcher is not he - It looked more like a cook s shop than a butcher s there was meat there dressed in the window Was he at that time - No I was in the house when my master saw them Court How long had your master had these lots - We went down into the country to gather them on Saturday and we came up on Sunday we go first to Stanford le Hope Do not other people collect lots marked in the same way - My master is the only drover in the country there is no other drover drives for the farmers that we drive for unless a butcher goes and buys a lot himself then he drives them home himself Court to Bennet Do the farmers in this part of the country usually employ more drovers than one - No Sir Mr Knowlys You are a drover - I call on Wednesdays and Thursdays How many counties do you call in - Sir Do you know the meaning of the word county - What counting them over oh I call in one county in Essex at Stanford le Hope about thirty miles from London How many persons do you deal with - I suppose four or five and thirty people Will you undertake to swear that they do not deal with any drover but yourself - Yes JOHN WOOD sworn I live in Kingsland-road and as I was going home I met a drove of beast in Whitechapel at half past ten o clock on Sunday night the 24th of May and before I got out of Bishopgate-street I met this Abraham hunting four sheep as I thought he was driving them from Bishopgate church to Shoreditch church I turned back and followed him and he hunted them through Shoreditch turnpike and he got before the church and turned them up Kingsland-road toward Mr Sillitoe s house and he went and knocked at the door Stillitoe said who is there Abraham said one the sheep were about a hundred yards from the house Mr Sillitoe came out to turn the sheep in they ran away and were gone very near a quarter of an hour I stopped a little bit while they came back again there was a light in the shop and Mr Sillitoe and this Abraham was following them behind when I went back to Smithfield I said to one Ned Langham if you know anybody that has lost any sheep in the morning only send them to me and I will tell them where they are I saw one lamb one shorn sheep and two Dorsetshire ewes they appeared to me to be two with wool on and one lamb I could not see any of the marks in the morning I took Mr Bennet s man and Armstrong and we went to Sillitoe s and knocked at the door and his wife came and said she was very bad and could not open the door for a long time the sheep were backwards in the yard alive Could you form judgment enough to say whether they were the same sheep that you saw driven by Jacobs - Yes they were the same Did you see any other sheep or cattle - No only some pigs Mr Knowlys What are you - A drover How long have you known Jacobs - I have known him a little while in Smithfield but never to be intimately acquainted He is a drover is not he - Yes as far as I know he has worked with one Jack Parr s I have seen him drive things but how can I tell what he follows I have seen him act as a drover but not repeatedly sometimes he is a butcher at Whitechapel he does drive for any of the people in Whitechapel he is turned off from Jacky Parrs Have you constantly worked as a drover - Yes Are you acquainted with this Bennett - Yes he knows me very well and with Haden before this matter happened he was driving them as hard as ever he could I overtook him to see where they went in at the man never saw me I will be upon oath I know he did not come by them honestly I know they were not the kind of sheep that he drives though I did not see the marks of them I can tell Dorsetshire sheep by the horns or wool it was not so dark but I could see the sheep sometimes I was close to him and he was on one side of the way and I on the other Did you tell any watchman on the road - No How many watchmen did you meet - I cannot say I did not tell them I saw one I might see more I can swear I did not see twenty I do not know that I saw any but this watchman in Kingsland-road If you had found any sheep would not you have taken them to the person you knew - No I should have taken them to the Green-yard as the proper place a man may go for miles and miles and not look for four sheep in a butcher s shop or cook s shop there was the Shoreditch pound and the key can always be found What reward is there now for a person who apprehends a sheep stealer - What is that Sir did you speak to me Do you mean to swear you did not hear me - I do not know what reward there was nor did not apprehend him on account of the reward I do not know what reward there is for sheep stealers I did not know there was any I have been a drover above seven or eight years and never heard talk that there was any reward for apprehending sheep stealers WILLIAM SADD sworn I am a watchman at eleven o clock last Sunday night was a week I was sitting in my box in Kingsland-road and I saw some sheep go by and I noticed them there were four and Mr Sillitoe came and asked me to help him in with them he desired me to mind his door and he would go after them accordingly I minded it and I saw them go into his house he brought them up there were four sheep went into his house nobody else but the drover and him Mr Knowlys Sillitoe s is very near your watch stand - Yes Then he who was doing a dishonest transaction chose of all persons upon earth to ask an honest man who was keeping the peace to help him - Yes he did Did you see the witness Wood there - Yes he ran by me at the time Did Wood at that time make any application or any complaint to you about these sheep - No not at all I asked Mr Sillitoe says I master are they yours he said yes they were and he being a housekeeper I obeyed his orders I had seen Wood up and down the road sometimes he lives in the road about two hundred yards from Sillitoe s I believe Sillitoe bears as good a character in the parish as any man - I cannot say to the contrary of that I knew him to be in the butchering line Court At the time they were driven in by Sillitoe was anybody with him - Only the drover JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn I was called up by Wood and Mr Bennet s man to go to the house of Mr Sillitoe concerning some sheep I knocked at the door and Mrs Sillitoe was in bed she answered me the door was in about five or six minutes opened in the back yard four sheep were found and I think there were one or two hogs besides they were all alive I cannot describe the marks of the sheep I went afterwards to apprehend the lad Jacobs in Smithfield I took him from the room I said I am come to take you on account of the sheep you left at the butcher s last night in Kingsland-road says he I left none Mr Bennet has the skins to produce Sillitoe was not at home I left word with his wife that he must come to the justice about five or six o clock Mr Sillitoe sent for Harpur and me to let us know he was at home I asked him how the sheep came there and told him that he must attend the magistrate which he did the next day the magistrate had a multiplicity of business and did not go on this Sillitoe was then ordered to attend again on Saturday but Bennett chose to have a hearing on Friday Sillitoe attended and he was bound over by the magistrate to be a witness on this prosecution I told him this that the magistrate was determined to know the rights of the business and if he had done wrong he must answer for it and if not he had nothing to fear I thought he must know the consequence but transportation for fourteen years was not mentioned to him the magistrate upon hearing how they found the sheep and how Sillitoe not being at home and being sent for and coming he said he thought there was nothing criminal in him and he should admit him as a witness he never was committed but by a certificate after Jacobs was indicted he always said in the presence of the lad that he left them there for the use of one Mr Lee and Lee was present and he was bound over as witness Lee was not a witness Can you tell me what curious hand has contrived to have a prosecution for a felony subjecting this man to fourteen years transportation - I cannot tell how he was indicted but I only know there was a certificate the magistrate sent for me I was at home he asked me what I knew concerning that business I told him how I found the sheep for the first word the woman said to me says she they are not ours but left here I then went after the boy the boy said he knew nothing of the sheep but as for Sillitoe he certainly never was in our custody one hour by warrant or otherwise till after he was indicted Does not Sillitoe bear a good character - I never knew him till this time nor was in his house I am constable of that very liberty where he lives and I never knew him till this time till he sent for me and Mr Harper to know the business Have you ever heard the least charge or the least intimation of dishonesty against this man - I never knew him till this day the skins are here they were delivered to Bennet for him to kill the sheep and he or his man has had them ever since Court to Bennett Have you kept the skins - Here is one of the skins all the ewes were marked with red oker one is marked head and rump that is a woolled one here is one that is marked down the near shoulder this is the shorn one marked down off the neck with red oker this is the lamb skin it is blued on the face Mr Knowlys Who advised you to prosecute Sillitoe - I do not know I took my own advice I thought he was as much concerned as the other I went to the magistrate and asked him for a warrant and he granted me a warrant I was advised by many of my friends and my masters they said I was to blame if I did not Is there no person in Court who advised you to prosecute - No Sir only this gentleman he said he thought we could find a bill against him What is that person s name - Mr Dalton Prisoner Jacobs I leave it to my counsel The Prisoner Jacobs called two witnesses who gave him a good character Mr Knowlys My Lord as to Sillitoe I am to submit to your Lordship that he being before the magistrate who had a competent jurisdiction to commit or discharge and he heard the whole evidence he thought proper in his discretion to discharge this man conceiving there was no evidence that could affect him in this transaction but he bound him over to give evidence he took his examination he heard all the evidence he had given and he bound him over it was decided in the case of Mrs Rudd clearly that where a person is before a magistrate having a competent jurisdiction clearly admitted as evidence that they cannot be indicted for that fact unless they have given a separate account it was determined on that principle before the judges that Mrs Rudd having been examined and having told all she knew of the transaction could not be indicted excepting that she varied and on account of that variance she was indicted now unless they prove he gave a false account I take it the magistrate s jurisdiction is competent Court There is no examination returned from the magistrate Mr Knowlys The prisoner is not to be injured by the neglect of the justice Court If you do not return his examination to me I cannot take any notice of it Mr Knowlys There was no examination taken down a person certifies that there was no examination I take it the magistrate not having taken it in writing should not prejudice this man Armstrong I was present he was bound as I tell you Court Was there any examination of him taken before the magistrate - Never none taken in writing Armstrong The magistrate asked him whether the sheep was brought there by the lad and he said yes then he asked mehow I found them and I told him and he bound him over Mr Knowlys I take it he is not after that to be indicted here for that offence it clearly comes within the case of Mrs Rudd Court I am clearly of opinion it is a to be left to the jury Mr Knowlys If you think it differs from the case of Mrs Rudd which was solemnly argued and decided here I am bound by that opinion Mrs Rudd was called before a magistrate charged there with the fact she there gave an account before the magistrate which was an untrue and false one and on that account only the judges were of opinion that she should be indicted here there is no pretence that there is a variation from the truth of the story which the man told before the magistrate I take it he is precisely within that case Court I certainly should not permit you now to examine if there had been any examination returned I should not permit you to examine him as to what passed before the magistrate and you did not examine him as to that in his original examination and before me there is no evidence of what he said before the magistrate if you could have made the question so as to have it saved you could only have made it on the ground of a written examination or on the ground of what past before the magistrate Mr Knowlys Clearly I make it on the verbal examination Court I shall certainly leave it to the jury Prisoner Sillitoe I leave it to my counsel The Prisoner Sillitoe called five witnesses who all gave him a very good character ABRAHAM JACOBS GUILTY Death MOSES SILLITOE GUILTY Transported for fourteen years Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr ROSE

A black bullock rather sun burnt which I accounted for from the hardness of the winter I considered it as such Q Did you make any particular remark on this beast - Yes I made a remark because I considered it as very strange I had suspicion that made me take the notice I did take of its being a long legged bullock blue brown as if fun burnt rather by the hardness of the winter It was bought as I supposed for the butcher to kill but may have fasted from Monday till Friday and that made it look thin I know a little of all kinds of beasts Q Do you know if it is a common thing for the strange beasts to prevent another beast from eating -

A No Q You never heard it from the constable - A No Q Did you never hear it in your life - A Who can tell what one has heard in one s life Q Did you never hear of such a reward - A I simply heard something of it to-day Jury Q Do you mean to say that it was black on account of the dirt - A Yes being dragged over the Moor Mr Knowlys Q Are farmers used to change their marks - A No he has stuck to that mark these ten years to my knowledge Q You immediately gave an account of this to your master that he had got Mr Weatherby s sheep -

A I went to Uxbridge to make enquirles what to do I was a poor man and did not know Q After receiving any information where did you go to - A I went to Mr Bishop s the Magistrate Q Do you know Read the prisoner - A Yes he is a little butcher at Hillingdon end of Uxbridge town I went to his house before I went to Mr Bishop s I asked him whether he had not got a sheep brought to him I did not mention Gowlett s name then it was about four o clock he said he had not bought any such thing for a fortnight I said to him sir you have had one brought to you within about these two hours or thereabouts and I told him Gowlett had brought it says he now Mr Weatherby I will tell you the truth of it I met him in Cowley fields and I bought it of him and gave him 16s 6d for it Q What is the value of that sheep - A About a guinea she was big with lamb it was not fit for marketing we kept them at that time to breed Court Q Then no butcher would have boughtA I should have thought so Then I asked him to let me see it then he humm d and haw d and said he did not know where it was Q Did he shew it you - A No I never saw it at last I asked him several times and told him if it was not mine I would not own it but he would not shew it me and I left him Cross-examined by Mr Ally Q How long was it from the time you had seen the sheep till you understood you had lost it -

A Yes Q He has lived there these forty years and been a butcher - A He has lived about Uxbridge several years Q And has a wife and several children - A I am a stranger to that Q This sheep was not to yourself worth more than a guinea - A No Q Therefore since it was in such bad condition unfit for sale it was a fair price if he bought it to cut up among the poor people - A It was but I did not intend to sell this to the butchers Q To a butcher then for the purposes of his trade it was not worth any thing -

t17960914-6  463 CHARLES SCOLDWELL was indicted for feloniously stealing two live tame ducks value 3s the property of Thomas Spurling July the 3d Mr Ally Gentlemen of the Jury The case which I have now as Counsel for the prosecution to call your attention to as stated in the indictment is only a case of grand larcency and therefore you will be relieved from trying a case in which the life of a fellow creature is involved yet I will venture to state thus much that it is a case of much importance to the justice of the country as any case that ever was exhibited in a court of justice for it will be sufficient to tell you I dare say to rouse your attention to this cause-that that man who stands before you was at the time this offence is alledged to be committed acting as a servant of the law acting as a person bound by the law of England with mercy to administer the process of the law and yet he took advantage of the distress of his fellow creature and under that distress assuming a kind of authority that he did not possess took a considerable property not contained in this indictment as well as that which is contained in it without the consent of the prosecutor On the day charged the 23d of July the prisoner was employed to arrest the prosecutor of this indictment the debt amounted to 16l 7s At ten o clock at night he obtained admission to his house and informed him that he had a writ against him and he must immediately come off and immediately accompany him to Newgate The prosecutor replied that that was rather a harsh kind of observation-if there was a demand against him he would endeavour to settle it No no says the prisoner you shall not settle it you must immediately come with me to Newgate and you must hire a post chaise The poor man said it is a hard thing to hire a post chaise to carry one s self to Newgate if you will take me in an humble single horse chaise which I have of my own I will go with you to Newgate The bailiff s follower Mr Taylor thought sit then to say we had better settle and accommadate the matter and in the presence of the prisoner asked what kind of accommodation he could afford the prosecutor replied I have 15l in the house you shall have that and I will give you something else as a security for the payment of the balance 1l 7s The prisoner asked him if he had not a watch he said yes he had then I must have that The poor man said his wife at that time being in a lamentable situation and such as from her appearance she must in a very short time answer the calls of nature sooner than leave his wife in that situation he would give him his watch the watch and 15l were given to the prisoner and he had no sooner got that than he encreased his demand says he this is a trifling thing gentlemen such as we are cannot come into the country without something to bear our expences he asked him for money he said no he had nothing left but a few halfpence he had taken in the course of his trade all the halfpence he had collected in the course of his trade that day amounting to about 10s and the honest gentleman before you received that 10s Gentlemen this is not all he asked him if he had no fowls about the house he said he had one or two and that was all He asked him if had not a goose yes says he then says the prisoner my wife is very fond of a goose I must take that to town says the prosecutor that is very hard O says he the goose I must have He let him have the goose still the rapacity of this man was not satisfied he was no sooner possessed of all this than finding the disposition of the prosecutor such that rather than leave his wife in the situation she then was he would have parted with his all- Have not you the lease of this house Yes says he and that is my all he had expended 300l upon it a short time before and the lease of the house he had Still not content he said I must have a note for 40l upon condition that the lease shall be minethis debt and costs be legally settled within twenty-one days One would have thought the rapacity of any man would have been satisfied with this the prisoner left him at four or five o clock in the morning and as the prosecutor had to prepare his bread for next day he retired to his bakehouse he saw the prisoner going towards his stable and in this stable were the two ducks mentioned in this indictment and fortunately for public justice he went into the stable the prosecutor saw him retire and without speaking any thing further I believe to the prosecutor he went away - Gentlemen about six o clock the wife of the prosecutor directed her servant as usual to let out these ducks and feed them the servant went to the stable but the ducks were gone The prosecutor of this indictment will prove to you that about two hours before the prisoner went into the stable he saw the ducks there he will prove positively that they were there at that time and then Gentlemen the question will arise what became of them nobody went into the stable but the prisoner at the bar and if there was no more evidence than that of the prosecutor I should think there was sufficient evidence to bring conviction home to the minds of twelve honest men but I have evidence which no mind can resist I have that which is a kind of confession at least an admission that he stole the ducks that are the property of the prosecutor for as if Justice ever had something walking before it to detect such enormities as those charged against the prisoner it happened that the prisoner met with as he was going to London the driver of a stage coach the coachman took him upon the top of the coach and no sooner had he got a few miles than in a familiar way and forgetting the misfortune which he might by and by fall into he taps the coachman upon the shoulder and cries out quack quack this produced a laugh in Court it is certainly a kind of observation calculated to excite a kind of simper but I am sure notwithstanding that it must ultimately excite the compassion and indignation of every man he did cry out quack quack tick tick the coachman asked him what he meant says he I have done the baker out of his ducks and out of his watch have you says the coachman yes says he I have they then went on a great way further and they arrived at some place where the coachman stopped to water at this time the ducks were falling out of his pocket the coachman saw the ducks were falling out of his pocket and said this to him Mr Constable if you don t take care you will lose the ducks which you have stole the reply of the prisoner was not a denial of that charge no no I say says he I will take care I will keep them fast I say therefore this is a kind of admission if admission is necessary under such circumstances that the prisoner did steal the ducks but the coachman will prove that the ducks were white ducks the prosecutor will prove the ducks he lost were white it will be therefore incumbent upon the prisoner to show by what means he obtained possession of this property for unless he can satisfactorily show how he came by that property it will be your duty beyond all question to say he is guilty of the charge imputed in this indictment Gentlemen after this which I pledge myself to prove to you there can remaining upon your minds with respect to the guilt of the prisoner and I am very much at a loss to know upon what ground the learned Gentlemen mean to defend him he is defended by very able advocates and if ingenuity can save him I am sure the prisoner will have the full benefit of every thing that ingenuity can afford him but I am at a loss to know from the little ingenuity I possess upon what legal ground they can defend him perhaps you will be told by and by that at the time all this property was extorted from the man which I have not charged in this indictment that these ducks also were given him by the prosecutor Mr Knowlys I really don t understand this mode of opening a case it appears as I expected that something upon the face of this indictment which is not of great value should be enhanced by hinting to the Jury that property has been illegally taken of greater value which it is supposed the lenity of the prosecutor has withheld from bringing before the Court if he has done so he ought to be called upon to answer to it or the Jury s minds ought not to be burdened with it Mr Ally My Lord I remember perfectly when Mr Justice Rooke said the other day when I interrupted Mr Knowlys says that learned Judge I will not interrupt the Counsel in his opening I will leave it to himself and his own candour and I sat down I say now I am sure the Counsel for the prisoner will not interfere but trust to my direction and I say in the case I am now stating it is extremely necessary to apprize the Jury of all the facts which I shall do fairly as well for the prosecution as for the prisoner because by and by a cross-examination will take place and facts may be turned and turned unless a previous explanation goes to the Jury upon the subject and therefore it is totally upon my own credit and candour I stare this case if I state it improperly I will give up the cause Mr Knowlys I only meant to hint that this is not the ordinary way of opening a prosecutor s case Mr Ally It is new it is a very extraordinary interference I thank God I am not of the disposition of many persons I am not by interruption to be turned aside from the line I was pursuing when I know that line is right and interruptions of this kind sometimes give me an opportunity of seeing into the case Court It is now high time for me to say to the Jury that they must divest themselves of nine-tenths of this opening it is quite sufficient to state that this man has taken the ducks if he has been guilty of extortion it has nothing to do with the simple fact whether he stole the ducks and any other consideration is out of the question it is quite an uncandid and unusual opening Mr Ally Gentlemen I agree with the learned Judge I desire you to divest yourselves of every thing I have said further than the facts shall come out but I must continue to state the case as it has been laid before me and will be proved I tell you I shall be able to prove out of the mouth of the prisoner the confession that I have stated I tell you I shall be able to prove the loss of the ducks and the possession of the prisoner I say when I have proved that you cannot have a doubt with respect to the verdict you are to give and I would have gone on to state other circumstances which afterwards occurred for there were several meetings afterwards between the prisoner and prosecutor and therefore I will beg leave to ask upon what ground the prisoner is to be defended for if it is said he is not guilty of the felony because it was a long time before the alledgment of a prosecution you are not to be led astray by such an observation for this reason the prosecution was not commenced for some time after the commitment of the offence and I will tell you why the prosecutor sat down content with the loss of his ducks while he was protected in his liberty but afterwards the story got wind in the country and I will say to the honour of the Magistrates in that quarter they insisted that the prosecutor should come forward and do that justice to the public which the nature of the case demanded it was in consequence of this that the prosecutor came forward for he would not have been able to have borne the expence of a prosecution these circumstances I shall prove clearly beyond all controversy and I say if you find him guilty and by that verdict you consign that man over to the punishment he deserves if he is guilty I hope that verdict will be held up as a mirror to those men who are servants of the law and teach them to carry before them that great Christian precept to do that towards those upon whom they have a process to serve as they would be done unto and that if they transgress the law it will not be with impunity and more than that I hope it will teach them not to do that which is often the case when they have a writ to execute like carrion crows to seize upon the victim and not leave him till his utter destruction is accomplished I have stated these circumstances you will hear the evidence and I know you will dispose of it as justice shall demand THOMAS SPURLING sworn Examined by Mr Ally I live at Bedfont in the county of Middlesex I am a baker Q Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A Yes Q Do you recollect seeing him at any time in July last - A Yes He came down on the 22d of July last he came in about ten o clock at night I and my servants were at supper he came in and looked hard at me and said don t you know me no says I I don t have not you got nothing better no says I he then sat down and said he had a writ for me from Mr Allen I said I dare say we could settle it if he sat down or give bail he said I should have no bail for there was no bail that I should go to London duectly I told him it was very hard I could call a friend in Court This has nothing to do with it go on to the ducks Mr Ally Q How long did this man stay in the house - A Till every thing was settled Q Had you been in the stable together that night - A Yes to see whether the horse had ate his victuals and there were the ducks Court Q What time was this - A About three o clock in the morning Q You saw the ducks at that time - A Yes I saw them there he said I should go to London whether the horses had eat their victuals or not I should go to Newgate and that would cost me two guineas I then went into the house again and staid about an hour Q Did you shut the stable door when you went out - A Yes Q Did you leave the prisoner in your house - A The prisoner went into the house along with me we staid together in the house about an hour and he took all the things Q Did you then go out of the house - A - A We then went into the bake-house and the prisoner went in with me and looked into the oven and then he went into the wash-house that was about half past five he went out of the bake-house into the wash house and out of there into the stable he staid there seven or eight minutes I remained at my work making my dough and lighting my fire he went out of the stable and laid good morning to me and never came near me any more Q Did you at any time after this go into the stable yourself - A Yes in about half an hour after he went away the servant maid went in first and the ducks were gone Q Amongst the variety of things which you had given I will call it to the prisoner had you given him the ducks - A I had never given him a duck nor was a duck talked of Q What colour were these ducks - A White ducks Q Did you ever see the ducks afterwards - A No Q Is the servant here - A Yes Cross-examined by Mr Knowlys Q You are a baker it seems - A Yes Q You attended to what the gentleman was saying to the Jury - A Yes Q Did you attend much to it - A Not a great deal Q What paper was that you had in your hand - Mr Ally Let it be read I will not have one word said about the paper till it is read Here a skirmish ensued between the Counsel of rather a serious nature Mr Knowlys Q Where is the paper you were reading - A The officer has it Q Who furnished you with that paper - A That gentleman Q Is that the paper - A I had not read it before but I thought it was for Mr Osborn as a witness Q Do you mean to say you did not read it - A I am no scholar Q Tell me if that is your hand-writing shewing him a paper - A It is Q Do you mean to say you did not read it - A I did not Q Upon your oath do you mean to say that before that Jury - A I read it as near as I could and I thought it was for Mr Osborn to come as a witness Q This man came to you to arrest you - A Yes Q Did he explain to you at the time that he came to arrest you - A Yes after a few minutes Q He told you he should take you to Newgate - A Yes Q For the debt was not it - A Yes I wished to make it up and I asked if there was no bail Q You had not the money to pay the debt and costs - A The costs he said were 10l Q Don t you know it was his duty to take you away - A Yes Q Did he forbear at your request to take you to Newgate - A I asked him if we could not settle it Q I ask you did he not forbear to take you at your request did you not request him not to take you - hesitates Q Was it your wish that he should take you - A I told him I would go Court This is no evidence in the cause except so far as to know how he came into the house he did not make his arrest it is certainly a prejudice which ought not to operate one way or the other Spurling He said why should I want to go and then when I talked of not going he wanted me to go Q Did not your wife desire him not to take you - A Yes and then he said he would have so much money Q Upon your oath did not you attempt to run away from him - A Yes he caught hold of me by the collar and said I should go to London that minute and he told me I should walk all the way Q Are you not lawyer enough to know that if you escaped from this man he must have paid the debt and costs - Mr Ally It is an extremely unfair question Mr Knowlys I care not for your observations I know you too well to care for them Q Are you not lawyer enough to know that if you escaped from this man he must have paid the debt and costs - Mr Ally I say it is a very improper question Mr Knowlys Let me hear what my Lord says and I will attend to it but I will not to you Mr Ally It is matter of opinion Court It certainly is Mr Knowlys Then as your Lornship says so I will not pursue it Q This was the 22d of July - A This was on the morning of the 23d Q And then you lost your ducks - A Yes Q Did you not know where this man lived - No Q Upon your oath did not he tell you - A He told me but I never knew by going to his house Q Now do you mean to swear that you did not know when he told you where he lived - A No not at that time he did when he came the second time Q Do you know Taylor - A Yes they came both together Q He is a witness for you is not he - A Yes Q Upon your oath did not you promise to call at Scoldwell s house the Monday after you were arrested - A No not then the Wednesday week I told him after he wanted the forty pound note I said if this is not settled in three weeks the note is forfeited and the lease too Q Did you not upon your oath promise to call the Wednesday week after - A I told him I would if I could and if I could not he had got the forty pound and lease security Q Upon your oath how came you to promise to call upon him the Wednesday week when you did not know where he lived - A He gave me his card that morning Q The 23d of July - A Yes Q Then how dared you tell this Jury you did not know where he lived - Mr Ally It is very unfair to dare a witness in this way Mr Knowlys If your Lordship thinks I am wrong I will stop but I am not to be reprehended by this man Mr Ally I submit to the Court that it is not the duty of a Counsel who is only by the courtesey of the English law permitted to ask a question I say it is the most indecent unbecoming and ungentlemanlike behaviour to dare and insult a witness to ask a witness why he dare say so and so I object to Mr Knowlys daring the witness in that way it is illegal Mr Knowlys Am I to have your Lordship s permission to go on as I shall attend to nothing else Mr Ally said something in so low a voice that it was not heard Mr Knowlys There is a noise in the Court I cannot go on Q Did you look at the card the direction to his house - A Yes Q How came you to tell me he never told you where he lived - A He never told me where he lived only left his card Q Had you any doubt where he lived when he left his card - A I could have no doubt Q When you lost your ducks did you go to look after the man you suspected to have stolen them - A No the man was gone and I did not think he would have done so after I had given him one thing and another to take my ducks Q You had no suspicion then that he had taken them - A I could not suppose but he would have been better than to have taken them Q When did you suspect that he had taken them - A Three weeks afterwards when he came down again I did not know who had got them Q I ask you when you suspected him - A I rather thought as he would have this thing and the other that he had taken the ducks I could not say Q Did you suspect him yes or no to have taken your ducks - Mr Ally He has answered you Mr Knowlys I shall not attend to you Sir I appeal to the Court Q Did you or not suspect him to have taken your ducks - Mr Ally If we are to be kept here all night- Mr Knowlys I wish your Lordship to silence this person Court He has certainly not given you an answer to that question and when you put an improper question I shall certainly stop you Mr Knowlys Q Did you suspect this man had stolen your ducks - A I could not tell who it was Q I don t ask you whether you know upon your oath did you or not suspect he had stolen your ducks - A I rather thought he must have taken them for nobody else had been in Q When did you rather think he had taken your ducks - A Because nobody else had been in Q When did you first suspect he had taken your ducks - A I missed them soon after he was gone Q You had his card you knew where he lived in London - A I had his card Q Did you go to London to enquire after him or take him up or take any steps in the business - A No I was so afraid of his coming down and using me ill in that way that I should not have done it at that time he had used me so that I was afraid Q At what time did you think of doing it - A When he came to arrest me the second time he came down and brought a note which I had given him before for 4l 19s and says he here is your note it is good for nothing take you balderdash note says I you have never been a-nigh to see whether the man would take it or not says he I will have none of your notes nor your

charge him before the 16th of August with having stole these ducks - A No I did not know it for a certainly before Q Did you make any enquiries about it and about him before the 16th of August - A I made no enquiries till I knew it for a fact Q Did you make any enquiries about this man and his stealing them before the 16th of August - A No Q You never took the trouble to ask whether he had been possessed of them before the 16th of August - A No Q Did you ask any body if they had seen him with such things - A No he went away when I was in the bake-house Q But you knew where he lived by his card - A Yes Q Upon your oath was not this card a true direction to him you have been at his house since have not you - A No I have not I suppose it was a true card because I wrote to him and the letter arrived Q I dare say you had so had an opinion of this man that you would not have wrote to him to desire the favour to send down a little pickled salmon for your wife before this dreadful affair of the ducks broke out - A He and his wife came down together before the 13th and they took their breakfast and luncheon and dinner Q You did not mean to give this fellow whom you suspected of being a thief a breakfast luncheon and dinner - A I did not know it Q But you suspected it - A I had not settled the business with him Q Did not you suspect it - A I rather suspected but I wished to settle the business Q Did you not suspect him to be a thief before the 23d of July - A I rather suspected it but I did not know for a certainty the business was not quite settled and he came down and said he was come down to settle the business and after his breakfast he had a luncheon and then wanted some pickled walnuts I gave them some bacon for dinner and while his wife was at dinner she said Lah what nice bacon your s is I wish you would give me some to carry home his wife said she must have half-a-crown for coming down instead of a man and I gave them some bacon and his wife said I should not be a looser by it she would send me down some pickled salmon then he wanted some geese I told him I would go and buy some but I could not afford to give them any then he said he would pay for them I told him to go and kill one if he would pay for it and he went and killed an old one Q Whether you wrote this letter before the 13th of August a friendly letter to send a piece of of pickled salmon down - A Yes I had not settled the business then he had taken two geese from me and promised to pay for them the next time he came down he would not give me any thing Q Upon your oath did you ever venture to accuse this man of stealing these ducks before you had a conversation with Taylor - A I have never had any conversation with Taylor but Mr Sadler was the man they rode up with Q Upon your oath did you ever venture to accuse this man of stealing these ducks before you had a conversation with Taylor - A I never had any conversation with Taylor till we came for the bail bond Q Upon your oath did you ever venture to accuse this man of stealing these ducks before you had a conversation with Taylor - A No not till the bail-bonds were al together Q Before you charged him with stealing these ducks you had no conversation with Taylor - A No Q That you swear - A Yes for I never saw Taylor after till we were all together the Tuesday after when I found out he had stole the ducks Q What time after the 13th of August did you accuse this man of stealing these ducks - A When they were filling the bail bond up about twelve or one o clock Q Before or after dinner - A Before and after too Q Before dinner you took him to be a thief did you - A Yes Q Did you dine with the thief - A We were forced to dine all together for he wanted to lock me up then Q Did you dine then - A Yes but we were not very friendly then my bondsmen were there Mr Wager and Mr Tilner Q Where did you dine - A In the City I believe it was the Red-Lion I told him of it and he was very angry he called me out of the room and he said I did have your ducks but if you make any more piece of work I will tear the bond and lock you up directly Mr Wager said You shall not be locked for I have got fifty pounds by me and the man shall not be locked up Q Is he here - A Yes Q That was the first time you accused him of taking the ducks - A Yes Q What was the value of the ducks - A Better than 3s I think but I had rather under value them than over value them he offered to satisfy me I said I would not be satisfied in that way I would let the law take its course and he said if you say any more I will take and lock you up Q So from the 23d of July to the 13th of August you never accused him of taking these ducks and never said you had given them to him - A There never was a word mentioned about a duck till we went up to give the bail bond not to tell him of it Q You never mentioned then about his taking these ducks from the 23d of July to the 13th of August to any body - A Yes giving up that day the 16th of August as we were going up I mentioned it to Mr Wager and I mentioned it to Mr Sadler going up on the 16th of August Q When did you first mention it to Wager and Sadler - A The day before Sadler said he saw him with ducks Q Did you ever mention it before the 15th of August to any body - A No I did not know that he had them Jury Did you mention you had lost them - A Yes to a great many people Mr Ally Q You have been asked whether or not you knew the address of the man or whether he told you his address I understood he did not tell you where he lived only gave you a card - A Yes Q I understood you also to say you did not mention any thing of the ducks till the 16th to the prisoner - A Never Q On the 15th the day before you came to town you mentioned it to Wager who was to come to town with you - A Yes and to Mr Sadler Q I also understood you to say that the reason why you did not accuse this man on the 13th wasbecause he came down that day for the purpose of settling with you - A He came down to settle Q There was still on this 13th the second time he came a demand he set up against you - A Yes Q Therefore as there was this demand you did not charge him with stealing the ducks - A No he stuck me up 26s at the public house and made me pay it all Q With respect to missing the ducks you never saw the prisoner from the day the ducks were lost till the 13th - A Yes he came down with his wife when he had the bacon and that Q Still this demand was remaining against you and therefore it was you did not charge him with stealing the ducks - A No Q You did not charge him with it till the 16th and then he threatened to lock you up - A Yes Q When you were asked whether you suspected him you answered you could hardly suspect him because you did not think him cruel enough to take them after all you had given him - A I thought he could not there was a great bason of halfpence and he took all them away Q Then he threatened he would lock you up the second time - A Yes Q Had you ever heard from any body who had taken possession of the ducks till you saw Mr Sadler - A No Q Then you could not ascertain positively though you entertained a suspicion that he had the ducks - A No Mrs Scoldwell came and offered me ten guineas if I would make it up JOSEPH SADLER sworn Examined by Mr Ally Q You are the stage-coachman from Bedfont to London - A Yes Q

I had known them for about seven months on the morning of the 5th thirty-two were gone they were marked with a cut on the right wing - I have since seen the one that was left behind and I saw some fowls at the watch-house on the evening of the 5th but I could not say that I knew them and the wings of Mr Robinson s fowls were cut - I cut them and the wings of the fowls I saw were cut in the same way I believe some of them were a good deal like them JOHN MORGAN I am an officer of Islington I heard of the robbery at Mr Robinson s there was a reward offered for the fowls I knew the prisoners and about twelve o clock on the Monday I went to John Hancock s house in White Conduit-fields - I had before that been to Mr Robinson s premises and found the lock had been forced off the hen-house door - it appeared as if it had been done with a three pronged fork I saw footmarks on the ground of more than one or two persons - one was a very large footmark and the welt of the foot was worn away in one part I met John Hancock coming out of his house with a basket and said to him What have you there he said Some fowls which are my property and I am going to sell them I asked him to admit me into his house to see if there were any more he said he could not for the door was shut - his wife had got the key and no one was there I said I should force the door - he said at my peril Mr Mayor who was with me pushed the door and it opened very easily they were folding-doors and not bolted - John had four fowls in his basket which were picked I found four fowls not picked in a room in the house and in another room I found William Hancock sitting picking a fowl and some more fowls not picked below in a fire-place under some straw which a dog lay on - I found a sack which had feathers in it and it was bloody I took these shoes from the feet of William and this piece of the welt of his shoe exactly corresponds with the mark made in the ground - it was a red soil but soft some of the footsteps were in a direction from Mr Robinson s premises towards White Conduit-fields and some the other way which appeared to be going and coming there were some other footsteps there I showed the same fowls to Selman the same day and to Jones on the Friday following - they identified them there was a cut upon the right wings I went after the examination to examine the fowls at Hancock s when I found some which had been cut in the right wing and some in the left but they appeared to be cut rather cleaner COURT Q What is the distance between the prosecutor s and John Hancock s A I should think a mile and a quarter this large shoe which I took off William tallies in all respects in length and breadth and in the mark of this piece likewise - there was no mark of nails because the ground was rather too wet I found some other footmarks which corresponded with the size of John Hancock s shoes the prisoners are both bricklayers I know there was a reward in which I expect to participate Prisoner JOHN HANCOCK He said the little shoes did not match at all only the big ones Witness No - I said I could not swear to them Prisoner WILLIAM HANCOCK The fowls belonged to us we asked him to take the live fowls to the office but he did not Witness Because I considered that the fowls which were running about knew the premises WILLIAM MAYOR I am an officer I went with Morgan to examine the prosecutor s premises what Morganhas stated is correct we went to John Hancock s and saw him coming out with a basket and a cloth over it with some fowls in it - we then went into the house and found some fowls here is one of them which had not been picked SAMUEL JONES I am an auctioneer and am son-in-law to Mr Robinson - he had thirty-three fowls in his premises I was acquainted with them this is one of them -I know it by a particular mark here it was bred on the premises I locked up the hen-house door myself about four o clock in the afternoon of the 4th and saw the whole of the fowls there when I went in it happened that dinner was announced and I did not put the key in its usual place but put it into my pocket and it was there till ten o clock at night - the premises are surrounded with a paling about five feet six inches high COURT Q Can you swear positively to this fowl A Yes - I sometimes took them their food Skill did not live in the house - he used to feed them and knew them the cut in the wings was his own cutting THOMAS SKILL re-examined I am out-door gardener to Mr Robinson I have examined the cut on the wing of this fowl - I cannot say whether Mr Robinson had such a fowl I never took notice of any particular fowl so as to know it again he had fowls something like it I cannot say that this wing is my cutting as I did it in the dark with a large old pair of sheep-shears about a fortnight before they were stolen I have been listening to what the officers have said and I believe it is true as I heard it before - there were footmarks of more than one person but I did not take particular notice I went with Morgan and Mayor when they measured the footmarks and every thing matched as he says GEORGE SELMAN I know this fowl - I had it in Mr Robinson s loft for a good bit while it was a chicken I am sure it belonged to Mr Robinson it is all white except the rump JOHN HANCOCK S Defence I had twenty-five at first and killed nine to get myself a pair of shoes I picked four to take to a gentleman to sell - I have about a dozen at home I have kept fowls all my life the landlord gave me warning because I kept so many he said they picked the garden and that was why I cut their wings some I have had for two years and some one year WILLIAM HANCOCK -

the prisoner and Lee agreed to pay for them on delivery in Leather-lane I and my boy took them in a cart the same day - we put them up a gateway just below White s door - I left the boy with the cart to take care of them while I went to receive the money I saw both White and Lee in the house - it was a very wet day I sat down some time and had some refreshment - some time passed and Lee went out with White s son we had some bread and cheese and porter - Lee went out with White s son my boy Mack came to me and told me in the prisoner s presence that Lee had told him the pigs were settled for - they had not offered me a farthing in payment I stopped there till Lee came in which was in about half an hour - he did not say what had become of the pigs Lee said in the prisoner s presence I have got nothing but a 50l cheque putting his hand into his left-hand pocket if you can give me change White went over to the public-house to see if he could get change as he said but he did not take it with him - Lee did not give it to him he came in again and said he could not get change White sat down and said We must draw up a bill and sent his eldest daughter out for a stamp and drew out the bill I did not at that time know the pigs were gone - my only reason for selling the pigs was to settle with my landlord for my quarter s rent I told him so that money I must have and I could not go out of the house without it Q Then when your boy came in he did not tell you the pigs were gone A No not till after the bill was drawn the officer has got it - this is it looking at it White wrote it - Lee could not write but put his mark to it and made me put my mark to it Q Before you received that bill tell us what took place A My only object was to receive the money for my rent I objected to take the note for I wanted money but at last took it as I thought I had better take it as I could get no money I was to have been paid by one o clock on Monday - I did not know the pigs were gone till Lee came in and began talking about payment I then knew they were gone - the bill was not paid I have not received a farthing the pigs were worth what I sold them for after I knew they were gone Lee gave me a sovereign as a deposit and said that was all he had - I could not see the cart the pigs were in in the room I sat it was just beyond the gateway - Lee left the prisoner in the room when he went out he was talking to me about one thing or another - I was not willing to part with my pigs without ready money for they were my whole dependence Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q How long had you known Lee A I never saw either of them before - the bargain was made openly in my yard I have seen Lee since I never supped with him off a fowl in my life- Lee and White are partners the cart was mine - Lee lent me the horse to bring the pigs up White s son came the same night and fetched the horse home I knew the pigs were gone when I took the deposit and the note because I had nothing else to take I took the note expecting to receive the money I cannot say whether the note was read over to me - they told me I was to receive my money on Monday at one o clock I do not think the note was read I have not employed Lee since to buy me some pigs at Romford-market when the note became due I went to their house and saw them both in White s house where the bill was drawn - I went there full twenty times after it was due and saw them sometimes they had not got the money to pay me - I saw White in Smithfield-market acting as a pig-jobber and asked if he meant to pay me he said he could not stop but would meet me at a public-house I staid there two hours but he never came he moved from his house and was taken on another charge on the 26th of December WILLIAM MACK I am servant to the prosecutrix I went in the cart with the pigs to White s house I waited with the cart while mistress went into the house I was about half a dozen yards from the door -

he told mistress he had no money for her except she could give him change for a 50l cheque she said she could not she had not got a farthing in her pocket - White then said he must draw up a bill he sent his daughter out for a stamp and drew the bill mistress said a bill was of no use to her without the money - she came away with the bill after a bit Cross-examined Q Who gave the bill to your mistress A White - Lee signed it she took it after I had told her the pigs were gone as she found she could get nothing else they brought the cart and horse home the same night and the horse was taken away the bill was not read at all mistress did not ask to have it read -

they were in the High-street Guildford three men were with them - the prisoner was one I recollect him well - the church clock projects over the hill I had a good opportunity of seeing his face - he was right under the gas-lamp looking up at the clock hewas doing nothing to the horses but walking up the hill by the side of them - he said Good morning to me and asked what it was a clock but whether he spoke to me I do not know he looked up himself and said it was a quarter to four - I saw his face then there was a gaslamp close to him - the horses stopped at the corner of Chertsey-street and then the prisoner got up into the cart the grey mare was tied alongside the cart - one horse was in the cart one man was riding a third and leading a fourth- I do not know who that man was I looked at the horses - I saw the three horses in March that year in the prosecutor s possession and am certain of them I saw no more of the prisoner after he got into the cart - I did not know the prosecutor before but as he was coming home through Guildford with the horses I stopped him and told him they were the three horses I had seen in January Prisoner Q Had you seen me before A No nor since I am positive you are the man -

the prisoner had hired a chaise of me on a job previous to this transaction On Wednesday the 18th of July he came and asked me for the same horse and chaise as he had had before on hire for a friend of his at Kensington who was going to be married and was going to Oxford and would want it for six days he did not give his friend s name - he said I should have 1l a day for it I said I did not want more than 15s - he took the same chaise and harness as he had before but another horse and agreed to meet me in the evening at a house in Jermyn-street to settle for a former hiring he had owed me 12l but paid 4l the day before - I went to Jermyn-street and waited from five o clock till nine for him he then came - he said his friend had got very tipsy and he was obliged to put him to bed and in consequence of that he had put the horse and chaise up at the Horns at Kennington and his friend would not leave till next morning nothing more passed then - I saw him again two or three days after he merely said he had not heard from his friend - I saw him again about the sixth day when the horse and gig were to have come home I think I met him in Wimpole-street - I asked if the gig was coming home he said most likely it would be home in a day or two and in a day or two afterwards I had a letter from him which I have mislaid or lost from my bureau which my wife has access to the next time I saw him was on the 31st of July - I then pressed him to settle the old account of 8l he said he had no money but that he had an acceptance as good as the Bank of England that I might take the money out of that and return him the difference - I at first objected but he said he did not care about the difference if I took it I might do as I pleased with it and settle about his friend s hire with it I negociated the bill and it was returned dishonoured - here it is it is drawn by William Golding on William Taylor of Calne Wilts for 24l 8s purported to be accepted - William Golding is the only name I know him by it became due on the 23rd of August - I saw my horse and chaise on the 14th or 15th of August when I went to Kennington to look for it I went to the Horns where he said he had put it up - I got no account of it there I inquired at several places and at last saw it standing at a public-house door in Kennington - there was nobody with it so I got into it and took the reins a lad came out and said it was his father s - I went with him to his father Thomas Evans in Belvidere-place Southwark then took it home and have had it ever since Cross-examined by MR HEATON Q He had hired a horse and gig before A Yes three times - the firs was on the 21st of June he kept it longer than he had hired it for each time - he hired it first for two days and kept it six then for four or five days and kept it sixteen the third was for one day and he only had it one day - on the 18th of July he hired it for a friend for six days and he was to pay me I did not know his friend - I had 7l 15s from the prisoner previous to the last hiring and on the 18th of July he gave me 4l more that was after he had hired it the last time - it was towards his former account I did not complain of his keeping it so long as I expected to be paid for the hire - the bill of exchange was not paid to me at my own request I refused to take it several times I said I had a bill to take up but my object was to get money from him - I got the bill discounted on the 31st of July when I received the bill he told me his friend was down at Coventry on business and I need not be uneasy as it was perfectly safe - I saw him twice after that as he used to call on a neighbour of mine on business - he did not call on me within ten days of my finding the gig I called several times at his house but could not find him - I cannot say when I last saw him I had known him about six weeks before this I was often in the neighbourhood and we smoked on pipes at the same tavern Evans told me he hadbought the horse and gig and showed me a receipt but did not say the prisoner had bought it of me I took a warrant out against the prisoner the day after I found it or the second day I saw Evans but had no conversation with him about letting it stand over - Evans said Let it rest a day or so but I was advised to the contrary - I said I would sooner have my money than prosecute the warrant was delivered to the officer immediately - I told him it was useless to go over the water unless I went with him I was busy for a day or two and could not go but I told him to call in Shouldham-street where the prisoner lived he was taken on another charge - I called at his house once or twice but the young man said he was out of town there was a person with Evans who he called Solomons -I have not kept him out of the way THOMAS EVANS I live at No 38 Belvidere-place Southwark and am a furniture-dealer On the 18th of July about two or three o clock the prisoner came and said he had bought a horse he thought would suit me being about to go a journey I thought it would suit me - he said he could recommend it as a good working horse which would suit me for general purposes and I should have the horse chaise and harness for 35l I said I thought that was not out of the way and we retired to the Duke of York public-house with Mr Solomons and Miller Solomons is a friend of mine and Miller was at my house I said Will you go and have a glass of ale we all four went and there completed the bargain - I paid him 35l and took a receipt which is here it is signed John Pinniger - I have known him five or six years by that name he said the horse and chaise were his own I sent my son out with them on the 15th of August - he came back with the prosecutor and another person I live at least three miles from Harley-mews Cross-examined Q Have you been intimate with him A I knew him as a tradesman but have not seen him latterly - I saw him the day before I bought the horse and gig and said I was going into the country he knew I had been in want of a horse for some time that would do various works - I did not particularly want it for that journey I had a horse and gig from him once before but not more - I think it was the 6th or 7th of July I kept it nine or ten days - I did not buy it he offered that one for sale and recommended it as strongly as this I had it on trial and not approving of it returned it - I lent him 20l on it and took his receipt which he has destroyed it was not for 35l but I took very little notice of it as the bargain was not concluded - the money was returned to me and the keep of the horse paid he promised me two tons of coals for the interest he was then selling them at 25s a ton- Solomons son introduced me to him about the first horse and gig but he knew me well Solomons wrote the receipts on both occasions and some trifling money passed between them which I understood was commission for some coals - I gave the money to the prisoner on both occasions I paid him 35l for the horse and gig - it was no loan he paid me about 1l 15s for the keep of the first horse but not as interest - Bannister came to my house soon after he got his horse and chaise to know what was to be done and we went to the Duke of York Miller came in I said to Bannister I don t rightly understand this business it seems strange the man should sell a horse and gig which don t belong to him - have you ever received any money of him he said Yes and I think said between 11l and 12l in cash and a bill for 24l I said Well then he has bought the horse and gig of you - he said Oh no I don t know about that - the bill is not paid I am quite sure he said that - I did not tell Mr Richards that all I wanted was 27l 10s nor that it was all that was due to me I did not mention any sum - I said Where is Golding had he not better come forward and arrange about the horse and chaise Bannister don t want to injure him nor do I I did not say I had not bought it nor any thing which he could infer that from COURT Q Was it the same gig that you had both times A Yes - I objected to the first horse and afterwards the same gig was brought with a different horse he came to me about eleven o clock in the morning on the 18th of July and said he thought he had a horse that would suit me and brought it between two and three I went into the country on the 22nd or 23rd of July J P BANNISTER The prisoner hired the horse and gig just at two o clock - he had spoken to me about it the day before and ordered it to be ready he merely said he wanted it for a friend and ordered it to be ready by two o clock JAMES MILLER I was present at this transaction they went to the Duke of York - I saw Evans put some notes on the table to the prisoner who handed him a receipt for 35l I had previously seen the first horse which Evans had - the prisoner said this would do much better that he had bought it and paid for it part with a bill and part with cash Cross-examined Q Who went to the public-house A Solomons Evans the prisoner and I - I only knew Evans in the way of business I am an appraiser and do business with brokers - he frequently buys at my saleroom I only know Solomons by sight - I have heard he is a lawyer - he is a respectable man Solomons asked the prisoner for 10s commission on some coals the prisoner gave him a 10l note and Solomons went to the bar for change which he could not get - he then went out and brought in 9l 10s I live in Johnson-court Blackfriars-road WILLIAM AGGS I am a Policeman On the 26th of September I took the prisoner on another charge at his own house Prisoner s Defence I beg to say Evans had the horse and chaise three times though he swears he never had it but twice -

they had also a mark of red ochre down the back and over the loins - I saw both the prisoners there - the officer showed them the warrant and said he came to search for sheep did they know any thing of them I think they both answered No - we then found these and one of them said when I claimed them Be careful how you swear to your property - they did not give any account how they came by them - I have dealt in sheep all my life these are half-bred sheep I have no doubt they are mine Cross-examined Q When the officer went did he not say it was to look for some sheep that had been stolen A Yes and one or both the prisoners said they knew nothing of them - I have never expressed a doubt about these sheep being mine I have always been positive of them Q Have you never said you did not think they were yours A When I first saw them it was through a glass and seeing they were marked in another way I said I don t think they are mine but when we got the key and went into the shed I put my hand on them and said These are mine - it was between nine and ten o clock on the 12th that I had seen them safe the ochre mark on them seemed to have been done a day or thereabouts JOSEPH FOSTER I am a constable On the 13th of June I went to the prisoners shed with Mr Starkey but I had been to the shed first and seen the sheep they were marked with red ochre from head to tail and there appeared to have been a letter H cut out with a pair of scissors but the mark is plainly to be seen - when I went with the prosecutor I saw both the prisoners I said I had a warrant to search the house for sheep - Tuck took the warrant and read it he said he knew nothing of the sheep - the other prisoner was present - Mr Starkey said he could swear to these sheep as his property - I took the prisoners into custody and handcuffed them - Tuck said he had bought these sheep of a man whose name he did not know near the Bell at Edmonton I think he said it was on the Tuesday - Bilton did not say anything about them but he said he was in partnership with Tuck and lodged in the same house Cross-examined Q Are you the person who took the furniture out of the house A Yes by their own desire I have an inventory of it here which Tuck made - I was desired to sell some meat which I did - I paid the rent which was 1l 16s and I have the remainder of the money COURT Q Did you sell the carcass of a lamb A Yes to a butcher the sheep we found are fat sheep JOHN FOWLER I am a constable I went with Foster to execute the search warrant - I saw the prisoners and heard Bilton say he was partner with Tuck - these two sheep were found in the shed they were taken and the prisoners were taken into custody - the prosecutor at first saw the sheep through a glass but when Foster got the key and got in the prosecutor looked on the shoulders of the sheep and said These are my sheep I will swear but they have cut the mark out - I looked at the place and could trace an H - I saw the red mark down their backs which I think had only just been put on Tuck s Defence We are quite innocent of the charge to prove which there are two or three witnesses to be called in MARTIN FLANNAGHAN I live in Church-street Shereditch and am a shoemaker I am landlord of these premises Tuck took them of me I have known him about five months -

I went past their premises on the Tuesday to serve my milk I saw the two sheep grazing by the foot-path between eleven and twelve o clock - I noticed a red mark on them because a baby I had with me went and stroked it I cannot be sure that I should know the sheep again COURT Q How far were they from Tuck s house A About twenty yards MR BODKIN Q Is not your son very intimate with Tuck A No Sir my son has been living in London till within the last three months since then he has lived with me except when he has been at harvest work - my son may have been in a house with Tuck - I was at home when Tuck was taken before the magistrate Dr Robinson I did not go they did not ask for any one to go - I saw the two sheep taken from the house on the Thursday morning and Mr Starkey said he had lost three sheep that morning and he had found two of them - I said Stop don t be so sharp these two sheep were there on Tuesday morning - I am quite sure I told him that and he said What - he spoke very sharp to me - there were several neighbours about but the officers were not there they were searching the premises - I am quite sure I saw the sheep on the Tuesday - I carry milk every day - I saw the sheep on the Wednesday about four o clock in the afternoon grazing on the same spot I had not seen them on the Monday COURT Q Do you know Lucas-field in Tilefield-lane A No MR BODKIN to WILLIAM STARKEY Q When you took the sheep do you remember seeing this woman A No I never saw her in my life there were persons about but no one said they had seen the sheep on the Tuesday -

the prisoner Smith was leading her with a rope halter - I asked him what he was going to do with it he said he wanted a pound or a green-yard to put it into he said he had had it given him to hold in St Paul s church-yard - I asked where he lived he said in the Dover-road I asked him again soon after he said in the Waterloo-road and then at another time in the Kent-road - this satisfied me that things were not right - and I took him to the station-house - he was taken before the magistrate and was ordered for reexamination and during that time the other officer found the owner of the mare - he saw it on the Tuesday following in the green-yard where I had put it WILLIAM ANDREWS I was in the police but have left it - I found the owner of the mare and took Brooks on the Tuesday following GEORGE MARTIN I live at No 17 West-square Lambeth - I saw the mare on the Tuesday it was mine - I turned her out at Mr Wheeler s at Newington Surrey which I have done for three years -

I went down a street and saw the mare tied up and no person near her - I examined it and when I had stood about ten minutes the two prisoners came there together and one of them untied the mare I walked towards them and said Is that your mare - Brooks answered and said Yes it is Charley I said it was a very wrong thing of them to tie the mare there for if it had been there five minutes longer I should have taken it to the green-yard which would have cost them 5s or 6s Brooks then said it was not his it belonged to Bill Adams and he had given a boy some half-pence to take it into the Kent-road - I asked who Bill Adams was whether he was the broom-hawker he said he did not know - I knew the prisoners and let the mare go with them and on the Saturday Wheeler s son came to me and I heard it had been stolen - I gave a description of the mare I had seen in Fox s-buildings CHARLES BURRIDGE police-constable M 77 I was in Kent-street on Friday night - I saw Brooks there and a third person whom I knew and a person was leading a mare I cannot say whether it was Smith -

t18340220-43  Before Mr Justice Park 361 THOMAS BUCKINGHAM was indicted for stealing on the 14th of January at Hornsey 1 sheep value 26s the goods of Sebastian Gerrard 2d COUNT For killing the said sheep with intent to steal the carcase Messrs BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution DANIEL MAY I am a watchman - on the 14th of January I was on duty near the Wrestlers public-house at Highgate about half-past eight o clock in the evening - I observed a man who is not in custody named William Miller whom I knew before coming out of Dutton s-alley he bade me good night and went on - that alley leads from Mr Gerrard s premises which are on Highgate-common just at the right of the Archway-road - about a minute afterwards I saw the prisoner come up the same alley - I could see he had something under his arm like a sack or bag - I immediately followed him and asked what he had got there - he said he had not got anything - I told him he had got something and must consider himself as a prisoner and go with me to the watch-house - I have known him ten or twelve years - I knew them both before - I took him to the watch-house - we passed the Castle in the way and opposite the Castle he made a stop - I said None of your nonsense but walk along quietly and then he did so - when I got to the watch-house I examined the contents of the bag and found half of a dead sheep - the two fore quarters - I examined his pockets and found in one pocket the head and pluck of a dead sheep and in the other pocket a great deal of fat and in a third pocket I found a cord two snares a knife and seven pence in money - Watling a watchman was present at the watch-house - he is not here - the parts of the sheep I found on him were quite hot - he said what was in the bag was all right that he had found it and Billy Miller knew all about it for he had also picked up a bag and that Miller had got the other part - I had not observed whether Miller had anything or not - the night was very dark - I made inquiry and went to Mr Gerrard s house and saw Winterborn his shepherd - I went with him to the field near Mr Gerrard s house - that was on the same night - we found five sheep there - I found nothing else that night - I went early next morning with Winterborn to the same field as soon as it was light about seven o clock - I found nothing there - we went to a wood about a quarter of a mile off and about fifty yards from the entrance of the wood we found a sheep s skin which I have here - the entrails of a sheep was rolled up in it - I then brought the skin to the watch-house and compared it with the head which the prisoner had in his possession - he was not present - my opinion was that the skin belonged to that head - Winterborn was present - part of the head was skinned Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Who was with you the night before and is not here now A Thomas Watling was at the watch-house at the time I searched the prisoner not when I stopped him - it was a dark night Q What part of the head was skinned A The wool was all down the cheek but about the neck the skin was partly off and the place where it was off fitted the skin - it is my opinion it belongs to that head - I am not a butcher- Samuel Atkins a butcher saw it - he is not here - I am a labourer - I am not accustomed to kill sheep - I never had any quarrel with the prisoner in my life - I was never accused of having committed a depredation at his mother s garden if I was it was unknown to me - I never made any remuneration to his mother or him or to anybody - I never had any difference with him or his mother - they used to live opposite the Castle two or three years ago or perhaps not so much - I never gave him anything to drink after this transaction - I was never in any public-house with him COURT Q What hat or cap had the prisoner on A A glazed hat like a sailor s hat WILLIAM WINTERBORN I am in the service of Mr Gerrard of Hornsey and look after his sheep - May came to me on the night of the 14th of January and Watling with him - in consequence of what he said I went with him to the field where master s sheep are kept - I had seen the sheep a quarter before four that evening - there were six sheep then - the field was fenced round - when I went with May which was just at ten o clock I found only five - on the following morning early I accompained May to search in the neighbourhood of the field and saw a sheep-skin and entrails I did not see it found but I was in the wood at the time and saw the skin and entrails in possession of Watling May was there Master s sheep were marked with a stroke of ochre right across the loins they were all marked alike this was a wether - I examined the skin at the watch-house but not till I got there I then found the ochre mark across the loins I am quite sure it was the skin of my master s sheep - a sheep s head was produced at the watch-house I saw it fitted to the skin it appeared to correspond it fitted quite as if I had taken the knife and done it myself the end of the skin was cut with a knife but not cut straight Cross-examined Q I think you said it was cut clean across with a knife A I said no such thing it was not cut slanting nor zig-zag it was cut in and out -

I did not notice whether he was on the mare or on foot - I saw him put her into his own stable in about ten minutes afterwards I was going up the place and went into the stable and asked if he had got an old soldier there - he said Yes - - I found the mare there - I looked into her mouth and said She is not a very old soldier - she is not yet three years old and said he had given her a rare bucking he must have come a long way - he said he had come upwards of thirty miles that day- the mare looked very much distressed as if it had come a long journey - there was a sack and collar there and a cart bridle - next morning I lent him a broom to clean her with and saw him in the stable cleaning her -

he said I understand you have sold one on the Thursday I said I did not want one now he said it was a young one and then Chamberlain came out and began to whip the mare about to show her off - I told him I did not think it would suit me at all it looked in very bad condition - Cherry said it would suit very well if I would buy it - they left without my coming to any bargain I was not at the stable afterwards but I believe the mare went away Cherry came up to me in the evening and told me that Chamberlain must sell the mare for he had laid out all the money he had in change for this horse which money he ought to have had to buy coke with he had asked 14l for it in the morning he then said Chamberlain would take 8l for it he fetched Chamberlain to me and Chamberlain brought up the horse and asked then 11l for it I at last bought it for 8l I paid 5l and the other was to be paid in a fortnight or three weeks if the horse suited Cherry told me the horse had been chopped away at Smithfield Cross-examined Q While Cherry was in your employ did he not bear a good character A Very good he lived six years in a situation after leaving us THOMAS HUDSON I live in Nutsford-place I manage Franks saw-mills on Saturday the 11th of January I took the black mare myself up a yard from Mr Franks door in Oxford-market to Nutsford-place neither of the prisoners were at Nutsford-place but I saw them both at Oxford-market Mrs Franks told me to take the mare to the stable after she had bought it I asked them both how they came by the mare Chamberlain said he chopped at Smithfield with it and that he had lent Cherry 2l Cherry said he wanted 13l I said if it was worth 13l I would not offer to sell it to Mr Franks under the value for anybody Cherry said if he had sold the mare they could buy a horse for 3l which would answer the purpose to go about with coke quite as well after this Mr Hickman came to me I delivered up the same mare to Mr Ship Cross-examined Q Was Hickman by at the time A Yes he owned the mare THOMAS OVERINGTON I am a police-constable I went with Mr Hickman to the public-house in great Portland-street I was present at the conversation and took Chamberlain and as I went with him to the station-house I asked where he got the mare he said he bought it at Smithfield that he knew the man but did not know where he lived and when we got to the station-house he said he did not know who he had bought it of nor who he had sold it to FRANCIS KEYS I am an officer of Mary-le-bone office on Wednesday the 15th of January I went to Middlesex-street Somers-town Cherry lives in a court which leads out of that street Hudson was with me I sent him to Cherry s house he brought him out to me into the street I crossed over and said What is your name he said Cherry I said I want you concerning stealing a horse belonging to Mr Hickman he said Very well I will go with you I said You are now in custody and reserve what you have to say till you get before the magistrate -

had seen them on her premises to the best of my knowledge on Thursday morning the 20th of November at Pensherst which is thirty-two miles from town—one ewe had a mark—it was sheared about three parts along the back and down the side—it was shorn the first time about the middle of May but the fly had taken it and I sheared it three parts along the back and down the side in consequence of that—there was no particular mark on the other three—I am certain they belong to Mrs Pott—I did not miss them till I heard they were stopped in or near London—I heard that on the Monday the day before—I know the

eleven o clock on the morning of Friday the 21st of November I was with Kendall and saw the prisoner pass in the London-road leading a horse and cart containing four her by a gentleman—I found this gown in a box unlocked in a lower room live sheep—I looked round the cart and saw two different addresses on it which caused my suspicion—on one side was Charles Franklin Battle-Bridge Middlesex and on the back was Charles Franklin Woodcutter Liverpool-road Islington —I asked the prisoner if the sheep were for sale—he said they would he when he got to Smithfield—I told him I was an officer and he need not answer me any questions unless he pleased as I suspected the sheep had been stolen—I then asked where he came from—he said From the borders of Sussex —I said the borders of Sussex were a long way round could he not tell me nearer than that—he said you know Cookfield Lipfield and some other places which I do not recollect—I said You can t come from all those places and asked who he brought the sheep from—he said at first he could not remember the name of the person who sent him with the sheep—shortly after he said it was Mr Porter a general dealer from Blackham-common and he was going to take them to Mr Smith a salesman at Smithfield—that Mr Porter had sent them up as an experiment and he was to have had 17s for bringing them up—I asked him if he had any letter to the salesman—he said the sheep were to be sold by Smith who was to get what he could for them and he was to take back what money they fetched—I told him it was the general practice to mark sheep when sent to Smithfield for sale—he said he was ordered not to mark them till he got into Smithfield—at the station-house I found two pieces of cord in his hat with a portion of wool on them and some red ochre in his pocket—the cords appeared as if they had been tying sheep—red ochre is used in marking sheep—I have the skin of one of the sheep which the bailiff swore to when it was alive—the butcher gave it over to me—the sheep have been slaughtered since last Sessions when the trial was put off Prisoner I told him I was not to mark them till I got to Smithfield and the salesman would do it himself—I do not know the names of some places he has mentioned—two or three people asked me if I came through this and that place Witness He did not say the salesman would do it himself—when he said he came from the borders of Sussex I said could he not tell me something nearer and he mentioned those places himself—he said at the station-house that he lived at Chiltington and he knew he was wrong in not having his name on the cart—that he bought it in Smithfield twelve months ago THOMAS HOLLAMBY I believe this to be the skin of one of the ewes—I have no doubt of it—I have been there fifteen months—the countenances of the sheep were very familiar to me Prisoner s Defence I was standing in the road between Penshurst and Tunbridge Wells—John Porter came and asked me how much I would take four sheep to London for—I agreed to take them and I asked him to let me take them that night and he said if I started by eleven or twelve o clock it would be sufficient—I went and this person stopped me—my horse was very tired—I met Porter about eleven o clock in the morning and I went to Blackham Common to get the sheep the same evening—I have been in the habit of working with a horse and cart

t18350105-391  391 ALFRED HOOKER was indicted for stealing on the 15th of December at St Sepulchre 1 ox value 28l the property of Jonas Payne —2nd COUNT Stating it to be the property of Thomas Allcock MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution GEORGE PAYNE I live at Milton near Newport Pagnell in Buckinghamshire I have a brother who lives at Charlton named Jonas—we are both farmers and graziers and are in the habit of sending stock to Smithfield market—I know a drover called Thomas Horton—Allcock has the care of my beasts at the market—on the 15th of December I and my brother had beasts for sale at Smithfield—I disposed of my stock before him and then assisted him—the practice of dealing is this we trust a beast to Allcock at Smithfield—Horton is the man who attends to sellling the beast which we leave in Allcock s care—he is to deliver them when sold—there are bankers in Smithfield—if an ox is bought by me I must go to the drover and say I want the bullock of such and such a person —having made a bargain with the owner first the purchaser of his drover should go to the seller s drover and state he wants the ox—Allcock the drover should then go to the banker and see that the ox is paid for and according to his information he delivers it or not—it is the invariable course to pay for beasts before delivery—we expect it we look to the banker for payment of the money—the beast is delivered to the buyer or his drover—on Monday the 15th of December a person bargained with me for a bullock for 28l 10s —the prisoner is very much like that man—he gave the name of Peachey I believe—that was one of the bullocks Allcock had the care of—it belonged to my brother Jonas—I should think any body acting as drover would be acquainted with the mode of dealing—I believe there is no other mode of dealing COURT Q You mean you never sell on credit A Never I should say it is invariably the custom to deal for ready money MR CLARKSON Q What the banker s custom may be with purchases you do not know A No I do not know whether my brother was in the habit of dealing with a person of the name of Peachey—I should not have dealt with the person unless I expected the bullock was to be paid for Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q You have been asked whether it is the practice to let bullocks go on credit—have not you heard it sworn that it is not the usual practice to require the money first A It is not the practice with me and I expect other people deal in the same way—it is the regular fair mode of dealing in the market—I have no doubt it is frequently broken in upon MR CLARKSON Q About what time in the day was this transaction A I cannot say—it was between ten and four o clock SOLOMON BENNETT I am a butcher and live in St George s market London-road I know the prisoner—I was at Smithfield market on Monday the 15th of December and saw him cheapening a bullock with Mr George Payne between ten and eleven o clock—I heard him bid 28l 10s for a bullock—I am sure the prisoner is the man who bid that sum Cross-examined Q Did you speak to either of the parties A Yes I spoke to the prisoner—I am certain of him—I heard him bid 28l 10s for it and knowing him I thought it rather a strong price for him to bid—it was worth that for a man to cut in his own shop—I asked him Are you going to carcass this bullock which means sending it to market—he said Yes —I said I think it a good deal too dear you will lose 2l or 3l by it —I was not before the Justice—I was speaking to the drovers last Monday week and heard of this GEORGE PAYNE re-examined I had no other dealings for a bullock for 28l 10s that I recollect Cross-examined Q You may have had A I do not recollect that I have—I do not believe I had COURT Q Was this sold for 28l 10s or not—was the bargain concluded A Yes my brother I believe made a memorandum of it at the time JONAS PAYNE I am a grazier I had some cattle at Smithfield market on Monday the 15th of December—I know Francis Peachey of Brixton—I sold him an ox that day for 24l —I sold no other ox for 24l to a person named Peachey—these memorandums are what I made of the sale of beasts that day—that bullock is entered here and lower down is an entry of one sold to Peachey for 28l 10s —I put that down from my brother s information—I had had no dealings with any Peachey except for the 24l one Cross-examined Q These are memorandums of sales A The beasts were set down as they were sold—I considered them as sold—there are two other names between the two entries to Peachey GEORGE PAYNE re-examined I gave my brother the name the person gave me I believe FRANCIS PEACHEY I am a butcher and live at Brixton On Monday the 15th of December I bought a bullock of Jonas Payne for 24l —I paid for it at Jones s the bankers within half an hour of making the purchase which is the usual manner of dealing—I did not take it away for some time—I went to my drover and pointed it out—I saw him mark it with ochre not with a letter but a private mark—I paid the money at Jones s to the credit of Jonas Payne—I did not take it into my possession till after I had paid for it—it is usual for me to put the letter P on all the cattle I purchase—I am at Smithfield every market day—persons could see how I managed my business—the bullock I bought arrived at home—I have known the prisoner three or four years and have seen him at Smithfield pretty often—he formerly used to work for my drover and he has driven cattle to my place—I did not agree to buy a bullock for 28l 10s in partnership with him and share the profit between us—I have not spoken to him for years THOMAS HORTON I am employed by Mr Allcock a drover at Smithfield On the 15th of December I had 14 oxen under my care belonging to Jonas Payne—I know the prisoner perfectly well by sight but not by name—I remember some person coming to me that day for a bullock in the name of Peachey—as near as I can guess it might be twelve o clock—I cannot say the prisoner is the person—I do not think I can identify the man who drew it—I do not think I delivered it myself but somebody came respecting a bullock for Mr Peachey—I went to Jones s the bankers and made inquiry there whether a bullock was paid for in the name of Peachey —I did not mention any sum—in consequence of what I learnt the ox was delivered—two were delivered in the course of the day in the name of Peachey but I was not present when Mr Peachey s of Brixton was delivered—it was afterwards that his was delivered—I remember the hide of the bullock I delivered—I saw that hide down at Rudderford s slaughter-house Lambeth-walk and afterwards at Queen-square—I am certain it was the hide of Payne s bullock which had been delivered in the name of Peachey —it had a large P on it exactly as Mr Peachey of Brixton marks his—I should not have delivered it if I had not belived that it was paid for—nobody represented to me that the price of that particular bullock had been paid Cross-examined Q You say Mr Peachey had the mark of P on his bullock A Yes that is his usual mark—I had 14 bullocks—they were all marked by the drover s mark which is a very small P but this was a large P —they had only one P on before they were sold—Mr Peachey s and this one had more than one P on I believe when I parted with them—I will not take on myself to say that there was not more than two—it is customary for the purchaser to put a mark on it—I swear to Jonas Payne s drove mark—not to the large P every one has got the mark on it—I had some in my care three markets Mondays and Fridays—they had the same mark as those I had the preceding Monday—I can swear this hide is one of the 14 I had that Monday by the drove mark—I had none of Jonas Payne s since the 14th—I had before but they had a different mark—the hide I saw was one of the fourteen I had in my possession—I did not see the second ox delivered—I know another Mr Peachey but we have transactions with no other MR CLARKSON Q Who is the other Mr Peachey A He lives in Tooley-street—he bought nothing of us that day MR DOANE Q Have not you sworn the prisoner it not the man A I said I could not swear I delivered the bullock to him—I do not think I have sworn he was not the man MR CLARKSON Q Did you distinguish Mr Peachey of Brixton as the man who had made a purchase A Yes the hide was obliged to be sold—it was shown to the magistrate and the mark pointed out—I did not take sufficient notice of the person to whom the ox was delivered to enable me to say whether it was the prisoner or not COURT Q Do you mean to represent you are not aware whether the prisoner is the person who had it delivered to him or not A I cannot say he is—I was not present at the very time it was delivered—I gave orders for it to be delivered when I came back—I was present when it was demanded and went to the banker s—I was not there at the time it was delivered—I was at the next drove—they all stood round together—I cannot say whether the prisoner is the person who came or not—he did not apply to me personally—he applied to the man who stood round the beast—I heard his voice but did not see him either before I went to the banker s or afterwards—I did not see him to my recollection RICHARD JEFFRIES I am a clerk in the banking-house of Alfred Jones in Smithfield On Monday the 15th of December I received 24l from Mr Peachey of Brixton whom I knew before—I was to place it to the credit of Jonas Payne—I did so—here is an entry in the book written short 28l 10s —at the time Jonas Payne called the book over in the evening to ascertain what was paid and what was not Mr Jones made this entry short as not paid—the entry was made from this memorandum ALFRED JONES I am a banker and live in Smithfield I have a customer named Jonas Payne—on Monday the 15th of December I settled an account with him— looking at the book this 28l 10s if written short—Mr Payne debited the bullock to Mr Peachey—I made that entry by Mr Payne s direction—he found one bullock he had sold for 28l 10s was not paid for—it sometimes happens that a person purchasing a bullock does not pay for it at the moment—I should pay that money to the grazier and afterwards deduct it if not paid WILLIAM STRIBBLEHILL I am a slaughterman in the employ of Mr Rudderford at Lambeth On Monday the 15th of December the prisoner brought an ox to me about one o clock in the afternoon—I slaughtered it by his direction and dressed it afterwards—I produced the hide of that ox at Queen-square—it could not be kept in the state it was without spoiling GEORGE RUDDERFORD I keep a slaughterhouse at Lambeth On the 15th of December Stribblehill was in my employ—a bullock was slaughtered there—I was not at home when it was brought—on my return home he was dressing it and in the course of a few minutes the prisoner came in—I said Is that your bullock —he said Yes —I saw him again that night—the bullock was then finished—he said he was going to send it to market to-morrow morning and would I let his porters have it in the morning—I said I would and I delivered it to them in the morning—I asked him who was to have the hide—he said a man named Kelly who would call on Wednesday for it but somebody called before that on Wednesday and had it away—he brought it back again the same day—I am certain it was the same hide—in the course of the Wednesday evening in consequence of what I heard I waited about and saw the prisoner in Lambeth-walk—I called him into a master butcher s shop and said Young man about this hide —he said Mr Kelly will call for it in the morning —I said I am not satisfied about it for I have heard you have not come fairly by the bullock —he said he had bought it fairly and paid for it to Mr Jones 28l 10s —I did not know his name at that time and asked him his name—he said it was Hooker—I said How came you to mark it with a P —it ought to have been marked with H —he said he bought it with a man in the name of Peachey and they were to have the profits between them when it was carcassed Q Did he say in or of the name of Peachey A Of—he said he bought it together with a man named Peachey—that is what I understood—he said with a man in the name of Peachey—as I understood him he bought it with a man named Peachey and they were to share the profits between them—I asked him where the man lived—he said he did not know—I took him into custody and took him to the station-house—he said they bought it between them to share the profits THOMAS COARE I am in the service of Mr Abrahams a butcher in Lambeth-walk I was at Mr Rudderford s slaughterhouse on Monday the 15th of December—I know the prisoner very well—I saw him there—he had an ox—it was just knocked down as I got there—I saw him next evening in Lambeth-walk and in consequence of what I heard from Rudderford I asked the prisoner why he took the ox away so soon because I thought it was a pity it should be cut down so soon as it would injure the meat very much—it would not look so well—he made answer that it was on the mall and he was afraid they would be after him—I did not understand what he meant but I supposed he meant it was got away without being paid for—I told master of this in the course of half an hour CHRISTOPHER RICHARDSON police-constable L 33 I received charge of the prisoner on Wednesday the 17th of December—as I brought him from the station-house to the office on the following morning he said if he had obtained the bullock they could merely make a debt of it JURY to MR JONES Q When an ox is sold to a stranger is it not usual for the parties to go together to the banker s A No we only take the word of the salesman—only the owner goes Q Is there a phrase in the market that their heads are swollen meaning if they are not paid for they are not allowed to go out of the market A I know nothing of that—the drover comes to inquire if the ox is paid for the purchaser does not come with him—I cannot say there need be any confusion in our business G PAYNE re-examined The person who bargained for the ox and gave the name of Peachey was a stranger to me and Mr Peachey is a stranger to me—he obtained no credit from me by using that name Frederick Zinc picture-dealer No 8 Windmill-street gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 18 —Recommended to mercy on account of the carelessness of the drover — Transported for Life

t18350202-554  554 WILLIAM BRANSGROVE was indicted for stealing on the 10th of January at Hayes 1 sheep value 2l the goods of William Welch —2nd COUNT For killing with intent to steal the carcass MR PHILLIPS conducted the Prosecution SAMUEL WYATT I am shepherd to Mr William Welch of Southall a farmer He had 153 sheep in Bull s-bridge-field—I counted them on Saturday the 10th of January—they were all safe a little before five o clock in the evening—I went to the field again just after the clock struck nine and one of them laid there killed—it was a wether and a long-woolled sheep—it was opened and the pluck and head gone and some other parts—it was a two-tooth sheep—some pieces were cut out off the legs and gone—I took home the skin and the rest of the sheep—I dressed the meat and kept the skin—I skinned it at home—it was a Leicester sheep JOHN VENABLES I am a constable On Sunday morning the 11th of January I went to the prisoner s house in Southall-green with a warrant—Joseph Harvey Mr Welch s steward went with me—the prisoner was just coming out of the door—I said Bransgrove I want you and we went into his place—I said Bransgrove I have a warrant to search your place —Harvey was close behind me—I saw Harvey take a plate off the shelf with a sheep s head in it—the wool was off it and in another plate on the table there was the pluck the head liver and lights—we brought it all away and took the prisoner into custody Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Do you live at Southall A Yes about a quarter of a mile from the prisoner s—Bull s-bridge-field is about half a mile from the prisoner s—poor people sometimes buy a sheep s head and pluck—I have known the prisoner a year and a half—I never had him in custody—he has a wife and two children JOSEPH HARVEY I am bailiff to Mr Welch I went with the constable to the prisoner s house—I asked where he purchased the head and pluck—he said he bought it—I said Where did you buy it —he said I bought it —I said Bransgrove I will ask you once more where did you come in possession of this sheep s head and pluck —he said It is no difference to you where I came in possession of it I bought it —I then gave him in charge—I took the head and pluck out of his house and took him before Lord Montford—I took His clothes off at the workhouse after we brought him from the magistrate and his shoes also—I took them home to my house and went to Bull s-bridge-field with the shoes and corresponded them to the marks close to the fold and found they did correspond exactly with the foot-marks—the weather was very dry but it is ploughed land close to the fold—I observed a good deal of blood on the side of his waistcoat and some blood on one of his shoes—I know Goring a butcher—I was present when he corresponded the head of the sheep to the carcass which Wyatt brought him—he fitted the head to the neck where it was cut off—Wyatt and I put the carcass on the table and Goring fitted the head to it—it appeared to me to fit in every respect—the carcass had been skinned at that time—we did not fit it to the skin Cross-examined Q Was the skin of the head in the other part of the skin of the sheep A No the head was skinned—the patrol was with me when I compared the foot-marks—they fitted in lengthy in width and the nails—I fitted to the best of my recollection three impression of the right foot and three of the left—there was a deficiency of nails in the shoes and a corresponding deficiency in the marks—I produce the shoes I did not count the nail-marks—I did not make any impression on the ground first—we put the shoe down into the foot-marks made by the shoe before—there had been no rain to the beat of my recollection—we made the comparison on Monday the 11th of January—there was very little rain on the Sunday—there was no rain at all an Sunday in she daytime but I believe there was a little on the Sunday night and very little—I did not see it rain but in the morning the ground appeared rather damp—I believe there was no rain on Saturday—the field was followed close to the fold—it had not been harrowed—I should think it had been ploughed three or four weeks—it was not in clumps but very fine—it is a loam soil—all the six marks fitted—to the best of my recollection they were all going from the fold but I cannot be certain—I traced them on the headland which is close to the fold—there were some marks in the furrow close to the fold and some in the headland which is turnips and not ploughed—there is no grass at all and very few wheats—I could discover the impression of shoes on the headland distinctly—I cannot say whether there were any impressions going to the fold—he might go into the fold in another direction—I was quite satisfied with the marks COURT Q Was this the only field in plough A Some part of the farm was wheat MR CLARKSON Q Would not the impression be made plainer on the young wheat than ploughed land A No for the wheat would keep the impression away—he could not walk without walking on the wheat—our fallow is nearly as fine as the wheat-land—I do not think there is any difference between the young wheat and the ploughed land—if we had only drawn the harrow down the field once it would have been quite as fine Q Were not these shoes made in the country A I do not know—perhaps they were made in London—such shoes are made and sold in the villages and are worn by labouring men—I swear positively these shoes made the impressions I saw COURT Q I thought you said you did not take notice how many nails were missing from the shoes A No I did not count the nails—I found the shoes were the same length and breadth and the ball of the foot corresponded—there are three nails in the middle of one shoe which agreed with three nails made in the impression on the ground MR CLARKSON Q Were there any men working in the field the day before A I believe not of course the shepherd pitched out his fold—the shepherd wears nailed shoes and so do I—there were several other marks along the headland but not by the fold—it would not be the shepherd s business to be on the fallow ground—he might have walked there if he liked— looking at the shepherd s shoe this shoe is not so large—if I had seen a mark on the fallow I could tell whether it was the mark of that shoe without comparing it because it is not so large—that is the only difference MR PHILLIPS Q You have been asked if you remarked any deficiency in the sole of the shoes—point it out A There are three nails in the toe gone on one side and on the other they are good—some are gone and some worn down—I found three nails on the impression—they corresponded in situation with these three nails and this single line corresponded—here are the marks of the blood on the shoes now—it is not to fresh as it was on the 10th of January—here is the waistcoat with blood marks on it—somebody has been trying to rub the blood marks out of the waistcoat with chalk COURT Q Do not shoemakers make shoes for country people generally from the same last A No doubt they do so—there are a great many nails gone out of these—when I first saw the blood on the waistcoat on the Sunday it appeared to have been rubbed out—I did not observe it till then—it was all covered with white chalk—Sunday was the first time I went to his house JOSEPH SPILLMAN I am a Bow-street patrol I went with Harvey to Bull s-bridge-field with a pair of shoes on Monday the 12th and fitted them to the foot-marks in the ploughed field within two yards of the fold—I am certain the shoes I fitted and the footmarks corresponded Cross-examined Q How many marks did you see A Several right up the furrow—I saw a dozen of these marks but not all complete—they were by the side of the field—the furrow runs up the side of the field—the fold is in the top end of the fold—the footsteps were coming from the fold—the toe pointed to go out of the field—I compared the shoes to four marks two to the right and two to the left—I took them in my own hands and fitted them exactly—the bailiff also fitted them in my presence COURT Q I suppose you took the shoes and pressed them down on the impression A Yes MR PHILLIPS Q Had you observed the impressions before you put the shoe down on them A Yes—I was satisfied before I put the shoe down that the nails were such as the impression would make—I was satisfied with it and when I put it down it corresponded in length and breadth—I have not a doubt the impressions were made by these shoes THOMAS GORING I live at Han well-bridge am a butcher and I have been so about seventeen years I fitted the head of a sheep to a carcass which Wyatt showed me—I fitted the bead to the neck and it was quite perfect—I can swear the head I fitted came off that carcass—I am certain of it—it was not cut at all in a butcher-like way—quite the reverse—the sinews of the neck were torn off an inch and a half long and that was deficient in the neck S WYATT re-examined The sheep I showed Goring was the sheep the carcass of which I took from master s field THOMAS GORING I did not compare the skin it could not be matched—the bone of the neck was divided at the wrong joint—on putting the bones together they corresponded—I am certain the head came off that earcast—I have not a shadow of a doubt of it Prisoner s Defence I have witnesses to prove that I was at home at the time this was lost FRANCES LEEMING I am single and live at Southall-green—the prisoner is a married man—I remember his being taken up on this charge—I had to nurse a child of his—on the Saturday before the Sunday on which he was taken he came home from work about five o clock—I said untill seven o clock—the prisoner went out at the same time I did—I know the Sugar Loaf public-house—it is on the opposite side of the road to his house—he said he was going to Mrs Atto to the Sugar Loaf for half a pint of beer MR PHILLIPS Q Who else was in the prisoner s house with you at five o clock when he came home A His wife and child nobody else—there was a sheep s head there the next day—he brought nothing with him when he came home at five o clock on Saturday—I saw the sheep s head that night—he told his wife he had bought it in Brentford is my presence—I did not see him bring it in—the lights and kidney were in the house—he did not say who he bought it of—I observed his clothes at five o clock but saw nothing particular on them—his waistcoat was quite clean as usual COURT Q What time of the day did you observe the sheep s head and pluck there A In the afternoon of Friday—I had been nursing there on the Friday as the child was bad MR PHILLIPS Q Did he tell his wife what he paid for it A No—it was laying on a shelf over the door on the right hand Q What time of day was it he said this A On the Friday night—I did not see him come in on the Friday night—I live next door—I went there about twelve o clock on Friday—I observed the sheep s head some time in the afternoon about four or five o clock—I saw the prisoner about six o clock on Friday night—I saw him come in between twelve and one o clock and he came in at six o clock again and I saw the sheep s head Q I thought you said you did not see him come in on Friday at all A I mean between twelve and one o clock—his wife did not ask him any questions about the sheep s head and pluck—he said he bought them at Brentford without her asking any questions—he brought nothing with him when he came in between twelve and one o clock—the head and pluck were plainly to be seen before he came in Q You did not go in yourself till between twelve and one o clock A Yes—I was there all the morning nursing—he was from between eight and nine and twelve o clock—his wife was up when I went there—I was not in the house when the officers came on Sunday—I went into the house on Sunday about nine o clock in the morning and staid about five minutes—I went in again just before the search-warrant came and was there when it came—I heard Venables and Harvey ask him how he came by the sheep s head and pluck and he said he bought it—I did not hear him say where—I did not hear him say What odds is that to you —I did not hear Harvey ask him where he bought it—it was outside the house—Mr Harvey did ask him where he bought it—I heard him say Where did you get this sheep s head from and he said I bought it —I was against my own door—I did not hear the officers ask him where he bought it—I heard Harvey ask where he bought it and he said at Brentford—he said he bought it—he did not say at Brentford—I was out of doors and the prisoner and Mr Harvey were in doors—they said this out of doors and in doors too—Harvey asked him how he came by it—he did not make any answer—he said he bought it—I did not bear Harvey ask where he bought it—I heard him ask in doors where he got it from—he said he bought it—the prisoner was going out as they came in—Harvey said Where did you buy it —prisoner made him no answer—I was at my own place and did not hear him answer Q On the Saturday night was there any thing the matter with his waistcoat A I did not see any thing nor hear him complain of it—I was present when the officers brought him out of the house—he did not in my presence tell any body where he bad bought it at Brentford SOPHIA ATTO I am married and keep the Sugar Loaf public-house about five minutes walk from where the prisoner lives I remember the Saturday evening before the Sunday on which he was taken—he came to my house that evening just as the clock was striking seven and left about a quarter after ten—he took a pint of beer—I have a lodger named Edward Enoch—he was there while the prisoner was there and never went out MR PHILLIPS Q Do you mean to swear the prisoner was in your house from a quarter after seven till half-past ten o clock A Yes I can with a safe conscience—Enoch was with him but nobody else—the prisoner had nothing but a pint of beer—he and Enoch were drinking together—he had a drop of his beer and then Enoch had a pint himself—they did not eat any thing—I know a man they call Dr Fox—he was not in the house that night—I did not see him that night—Frances Leeming fetched a pot of beer to the prisoner s house—the prisoner was at my house at that time drinking—she fetched it at very near ten o clock—Leaning saw him there—I went up stairs with my children to bed and I do not know whether the prisoner asked her what she wanted the beer for—my biggest boy Joseph drew it for her—I heard her ask for it—she paid 4d for it—I do not know whether the prisoner spoke to her—I staid up stairs about half an hour—the prisoner was still there when I came down—he staid no time after I came down—he paid me 2d for the beer—Enoch was present when he paid and he paid me for his—Enoch lodges in my house and he remained when the prisoner went away—he went to bed about eleven o clock—my husband did not come home till Sunday morning—I went to bed at the same time as Enoch—I did not observe any blood on the prisoner s clothes—I heard next day that he was taken away by the officers—I did not go before Lord Montford—he wag taken before Lord Montford on the Sunday—I knew he was gone there MR CLARKSON Did you know that the prisoner was taken to Lord Montford before he was taken or did you hear of it afterwards A I heard of it afterwards—I am not related to the prisoner—I have known him two years and always heard a good character of him EDWARD ENOCH I lodge at the Sugar Loaf public-house—I remember the prisoner coming there on the Saturday before he was takes just as the clock had done striking seven—he had a pint of beer—I had some with him and I had a pint afterwards—he drank some of mine—before he went away he paid for his pint and I for mine—I have known him two or three years—he is an honest respectable character and worked for Mr Riley at the time MR PHILLIPS Q Did any body come into the public-house when you were drinking with the prisoner A Yes there were three or four more there—William Rose was one and I forget the others—Fanny Leeming came in and fetched a pot of ale—Mrs Atto gave her the beer—I think she drew it—I will not be sure—I heard her ask Mrs Atto for it and she went and drew it I believe—I saw her come into the room where we sat and Fanny Leeming came into the room with the beer after it was drawn—I saw her pay Mrs Atto for it—she paid her a silver sixpence for a pot of ale—she did not ask for any change—6d is always the price of a pot of ale—I have seen her pay 6d for a pot of ale before—she paid the sixpence in silver not in halfpence Q On your oath do you not know the prisoner was in his own house drinking with Dr Fox A No I will take my oath he was not for he was with me for it was the very night the job happened JOHN VENABLES re-examined I took the prisoner into custody on Sunday I took a pair of spectacles out of his pocket—I said You do not wear spectacles Bransgrove whose spectacles are these he said They are Dr Fox s —he was asked where was Dr Fox—he said In my house on Saturday night from seven o clock in the evening until twelve o clock at night —he said Fanny Leeming was in the house—he said he fetched a good deal of beer for Dr Fox and himself together—he said Leeming was in the house from seven till twelve o clock—he said he was there part of the time—he did not tell me what part of the time he was there with Dr Fox—he said Fox left his house at twelve o clock—he said Dr Fox laid the spectacles on the table that the Doctor got drunk as well as I could understand and he got them into his possession—he said the beer came from Mrs Atto s—he said three or four pots were fetched in the course of the evening and Dr Fox Leeming and his wife drank it and he himself had part along with them MR CLARKSON Q I suppose you were fully possessed of all this conversation with the prisoner when you were first examined A Yes I have not spoken a word to the prosecutor since I have been in Court—I have not been talking to any body about it—I went before Lord Montford on Sunday the 11th of January—he gave this account about Dr Fox on the Sunday in Lord Montford s office where the spectacles were taken from him—I was sworn as a witness—Lord Montford took down what I said it was afterwards read over to me and I put my name to it—I did not state before Lord Montford this conversation respecting Dr Fox because he heard as well as I did what the prisoner said—I did not take notice whether he took it down—he was then acting as a magistrate—I have known Dr Fox two years—I saw him a week or nine days afterwards and gave him his spectacles—I did not take him before the magistrate—there was more than one examination—the prisoner did not tell me he had been drinking beer with Enoch at Mrs Atto s—the bailiff and Mr Welch were present before Lord Montford when the prisoner said he had been with Dr Fox COURT Q Can you form any judgment whether the pluck found on the shelf was the pluek of a sheep recently killed or whether it had been killed some days A Recently killed—it appeared to me to have been killed on the night before—I went to the prisoner between ten and eleven o clock on Sunday morning MR CLARKSON Q What difference is there between a pluck killed the night before and two nights before A It appeared fresh when I saw it on the Sunday morning—I think it must have been staler if it had been bought before—it looked much fresher than if it had been killed the day before THOMAS GORING re-examined I saw the pluck on Monday morning—I should think it could not have been killed longer than the Saturday—I am sure it could not—from its appearance and the state of the weather it could not have been killed longer than Saturday JURY Q As it was killed in an unbutcher-like manner would there not be more blood found on the prisoner s clothes A Not at all as no part except the head and pluck were taken away—I could kill a sheep and not have a spot of blood on me—he had no business to have any blood upon him—when a sheep is cut open there is no blood from the inside—I it is only when it is stuck—I feel certain it must have been killed on the Saturday—I am sure of it and am sure the head came off that body GUILTY Aged 23 — Transported for Life First Jury before Mr Recorder

and these were earlier than any close round about me—on Thursday afternoon the 31st of December between one and two o clock I counted them and had twenty—on the following morning in consequence of what my man told me I counted them and missed one—I have never seen the carecase myself since—I have since killed one of the other lambs—I did not see it after it was slain—it was sent to the butcher—I do not know any body in the neighbourhood who had lambs of the same description—I think it was a wether lamb that was missing JAMES OTHEN I am a Bow-street patrol stationed in the neighbourhood of Ilford On the 1st of January I was in company with Davis the constable of Ilford—I know Mrs Hones—her house at Ilford is an empty house belonging to Mr Squih in White Hart-yard Ilford—I know the house where Susan White lives—that is in White Hart-yard also—White s house is about a yard from the window in which an entrance was made to an uninhabited house—I went with Davis to the uninhabited house on the let of January between two and three o clock in the afternoon—I had not then taken any body into custody—when I got there Davis got in at the window and opened the door which was locked—I searched there and found in the front room a lamb slaughtered and hung up by a hammer in the way of a gamble—the hammer was run through the hind legs—the lamb appeared quite fresh—the blood was dripping from the nose at the time—it was nearly cold—I found a knife lying under the nose of the lamb—Davis has it—I took Deller and Burton into custody a very few minutes after

such a lamb as that flock consists of and apparently about the same age it had been born about October I should think—I afterwards saw one of Mrs Baker s lambs which had been killed and weighed—the one I found weighed 31lbs —I did not see it weighted but it appeared as near as can be the same size—it was killed next day—it was about the same size and same breed—I produce a knife which I found under the nose of the lamb all over blood—I afterwards accompanied the patrol to take charge of the prisoners—I observed the spots of blood on Burton s dress and Deller s smock-frock—they were spots of very fresh blood—the lamb appeared very recently slain—it was hardly cold—it must have been slain that morning after midnight—after finding the knife I showed it to Jemima Dawson—she recognised it directly—Deller is a labouring man in the neighbourhood—I have known him work but not for a long time past —not for some months—I have never known Burton do a day s work since he has been at

before—Deller slept at his lodging on the Wednesday night and he was at my house on Thursday afternoon and Burton with him—they both left together between four and five o clock—before they went out Deller did not ask me for any thing belonging to him— looking at a knife I gave Deller a knife like this just as they went away—they were having a bit of victuals and I gave him the knife to eat it with—he did not ask me for it—after eating the victuals they went away and took the knife with them—I have no doubt about its being the same knife—Deller came into my house again on the Friday afternoon about four o clock and brought in four half-quartern loaves—I saw this knife afterwards in Ilford prison in Davis s presence—it looks to me to be the same knife—I have no doubt of it—they

the morning the iron bar of the gate was lifted up and one gate open WILLIAM ALLARD I am a butcher I saw the lamb which was found in the uninhabited house—it was a young one and I consider it a Dorset breed—I saw another lamb of the prosecutors s which was slain the same day Saturday —I should consider it one of the same breed as the first—the one stolen was skinned—there was nothing that a shepherd could identify it by but when both were skinned we considered them both to be of one flock and the same breed SUSAN WHITE I am single I live in White Hart-yard Ilford next door but one to the

cared if the prosecutors had not been there—before the Magistrate at the examination Deller asked who the prosecutors were—Burton said it was Baker and Mrs Hone—Burton said he would drop these concerns if he got home again he would have no more of these games—Deller either said he would go away or go to sea—Burton asked him if he would not come back and drink those pints that would be for

other four—he said he would not have that taken away for it was the best of the lot and he could not think of parting with his horses without I gave more money—i said I understood the horse was a roarer and I had rather not chop with him—he said mine was worn out and his was very valuable—I said we might as well go into the house which we did and there we made a bargain for four of my horses and 8l for this one of his—I gave him my four horses and a cheque for 8l for the horse he had—I asked him who he got it from and whose it was—he said it was a gentlemen s horse and the gentleman had used it in a four-wheeled carriage—he did not say the bought it of him—I asked it the horse had not been in coach-harness before—he said no it was a gentlemen s horse and had been in a four-wheeled carriage and the only reason he sold it was because he did not like to hear it make a noise up the hills—I said If your horse is all right he is worth a good deal of money but my young man says he is a roarer —I told him twice I had rather not have any thing to do with it but if it was all right it was a valuable horse—he said the gentleman s sole reason for selling it was that it was a roarer and he did not like to hear it make a noise up the hills—i gave him a check on purpose that I should get his name and I wrote down the name he gave me at the time and have it here—he said his name was I believe John Brown Byfield Near Oakingham Berks —I am not quite certain of his Christian name—I said Oakingham is in Rutlandshire is it not —he said No in Berkshire —I got the horse home—I suspected it was not a roarer and thought he could not have got it honestly said and I came up to London to Smith fields—I got there on the next Friday week and saw the prisoner there—I told him the horse had proved a stolen one—he said the devil he had then of course you must have your money again —he wanted to know how it was found out—I said A gentleman s servant has been to my house and owned it —I do not know what answer he made—i said Of course you know who you had him of —he said he bought him of a man as he was returning from Henley fair—I said You know the man do you not —he said Not well enough I am afraid but he said if I could go home with him he could find the man he bought him of—the wished to call me aside afterwards—I said What have you done with my four horse —he said he sold them two or three days ago—I said To whom —he said As I said before if you will give me time I can fined the man I sold the horses to and likewise the man I bought the other of —I said Of course I cannot let you go I would rather lose my horse and money than my character —he was in custody of officer at that time—i have never got the money for my cheque nor the horses I had exchanged Cross-examined Q I do not understand you to say that when he asked for time that you had him in custody A Yes the policeman had him in custody before I saw him—when I saw him at the fair he did not say he bought the horse of John Brown of Byfield but that was his won name—I made the cheque payable to Mr Brown as the name he gave—I consider I gave a fair price for the horse but if he had not been unsound I consider him worth more—I have the other part of my cheque here CHARLES CHAMBERS I am a policeman I was employed to look after the prisoner—from directions I received from the young man I found him in Smithfield—i was Drinkwater and spoke to him—he said at the Compter that his name was Sanderson—I was searching him and he pulled out a tobacco-box with Lucifer matches in it JAMES BATES

the 7th of March and bought a horse for 8l 10s—a man came to to the public-house I was at with the horse—I said Are you going to sell it —he said Yes I was showing it to this gentlemen but he did not like it as it was a roarer —he said he wanted 22l for it—I said that was too much money and after some conversation agreed to give him 10l and the horse I bought the day before for it—I have sent for witnesses from the country but I have not been able to send them the money down to pay their expenses and they said they could not come without their expenses being paid—I said all I wanted was time to find the man—we walked a little way—I was locked up and had no opportunity of finding the man—I have no doubt but that he was in the market that same day—I told Mr Drinkwater that it was my horse not that it was a gentlemen s but the person I had it of said it belonged to a gentleman and used to run in a four-wheeled chaise—the reason I gave the name of John Brown was we are frequently liable to have informations laid against us—he said he did not know me before but I bought two or three horses of him before—the only reason I had for giving a false name was the fear of an information for selling without a license JAMES COLE I am a coachman I have no particular lodging latterly—I live at the Horse and Groom in Oxford-street—I formerly belonged to a gentleman who belongs to the

horse and cart down the Back-road to Sun Tavernfields—he said he did not—I took him on the road which leads to Sun Tavern-fields in a direction to the station-house—we had to pass through a toll-gate the toll-collector was there and he immediately said This is the lad who drove the horse and cart through —Sarles then said I did drive it down by order of my master —I asked him if he worked for Stebbings and he said Yes —he said Stebbings his master and another man met him at Sun Tavern-fields with a van and they drove it into the open space of ground into an open field and there his master Stebbings and another man unloaded the butter into the van that they left the horse and cart in the open field and proceeded back with the van to Cable-street with the tubs in it—I did not ask him what time it was—he said he did not drive the van book Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How far is Sun Tavern-fields from Brewer s Quay A About a mile I should think—it might be a trifle more—I should not think it is a mile and a half—I could walk it very easily in twenty minutes—it may be a mile and a quarter CHARLES JOHN JONES I was collector of tolls at the New-road gate near Cable-street I know Stebbings s house in Cable-street which is in the same line as Rosemary-lane—it is about five or six hundred yards from my gate or rather more—a person driving from Stebbing s shop to Sun Tavern-fields would have to pass through my gate—I know Sarles—he drove a horse and cart through the gate about six o clock that evening—I did not look at the clock but it was about the time the policeman were coming on evening duty—the cart had three firkins on the top of the copse like butter and the body of the cart was full of the same casks about three in a row—I am certain he is the person who was driving it—there was another man with him who stayed and paid the toll—I have not seen that man since JOHN BURROWS I am a policeman I know all the prisoners—I believe Sarles to be in Stebbings employ—I have seen him frequently in the lane for the last month and have seen him many times in Stebbings shop in Cable-street at work—he keeps a sheep s-head shop—I saw him there within two or three days of the robbery—on the evening in question I saw him close to the New-road turnpike-gate about six o clock or from that to twelve minutes after six o clock—he was walking alongside a horse and cart driving it—there were casks in the cart—he was going towards Sun Tavern-fields HENRY WILLIAMS I am fourteen years old and am in the employ of Mr Potter who keeps a van up the horse-ride in Wellclose-square Stebbings keeps a horse up the same ride—he came there on Friday the 11th of November between three and four o clock in the afternoon—two men were with him—I do not know who they were—one had a green coat and the other a fustian dress like a carman—I know it was between three and four o clock because my master went to Chelsea along with some soldiers with a horse and cart along a quarter to one o clock and he told me I might go home for three hours—I know the time by that—it was two hours and a half or three hours after master went out—I had been up the ride about two minutes before they came—I did not look at any clock—Stebbings wrenched the padlock off the stable door where his own horse was kept—Mr Potter s van is kept in a different place—Stebbings said to me Mr Potter is a long time gone to Chelsea —I said Yes he is a long time —he said I want your cart now I suppose I can t have it —he said to the other two men Will a van do —they said Yes that will do let us have it —he opened the gate and drew the van out—they harnessed the horse in a great hurry and made a mistake by putting the breeching on where the reach-chain goes on the horse—the man in the green coat said to the other two D—it all make haste the man in the green coat jumped up into the van and laid hold of the reins—I said There is no whip at home Mr Stebbings for master has got it out —Stebbings said Let us have a whip —I gave him an old one of master s—a stick with a piece of leather fastened to it—he handed it up to the man in the green coat and the van then drove off—Stebbings walked alongside the man in the fustian dress on the pavement by the side of the van and the man in the green coat drove Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You have been examined befor the Magistrate A Yes—I saw Stebbings walk as far as Gracers-alley with the other man—that is about 100 yards I believe—it is the next alley to the horse-ride—the man who got into the cart drove off as hard as he could drive—Gracer s-alley would be in Stebbings way home MR BODKIN Q What sort of a horse was it A He drove it as fast as the old mare could go which was not very fast—it was just on the trot—Stebbings was walking on the pavement even with the van—I turned back to go home and saw no more JOHN POTTER I am carman and live in Chapman-street St George s On Friday the 11th of November I went to Chelsea to fetch some men s things—I left Williams at home—I had a van in my cart-house—I left the stable about one o clock—the van was there then—I returned about seven o clock in the evening—the prisoner Stebbings horse was out then and I found the van gone—Stebbings returned with it about eight o clock and his horse was in it—I saw him come along—he said he had been doing a 3s job and a very hard one that he gave the man 6d out of it—he was alone Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Does he not let out a horse and cart now and then A He had the use of my cart—not the van—he kept a horse of his own to fetch his things from market—he had paid part of the money for repairing the shaft of my cart MR BODKIN Q What is he by business A He keeps a sheep s-head shop and sells greens and things—I have known Sarles for years—he was living with Stebbings at the time this happened because he had left his former place at Mr Ive s—Stebbing s had paid 12s 6d to the Wheelwright to repair the cart and I allowed him to work it out—that was the cart not the van—he was not in the habit of using the van—he never lent the cart out to my knowledge MR CLARKSON Q When he said he had been doing a 3s job did he tell you to keep it secret A No he did not—he said he had used my van—he took it out once before in the dark and said he had had a balk job ANN WEATHERFIELD I live in Upper Chapman-street St George s East I know Cable-street and the clock-house there—Rosemary-lane is all in the same line—on Friday evening the 11th of November I was near the clock-house with Mr Potter s little girl—the prisoner Coxson keeps a buttershop a little distance from the clock-house on the opposite side of the way—while I was standing there I saw Mr Potter s van standing nearly opposite it was three or four or five or six doors from Coxson s—I cannot say the time it might be about six o clock or a little after—there were butter firkins in the van—it was fuller on the right-hand side than the left—it was covered over with matting at the top—I saw Stebbings on the opposite side by the door of the public-house—at first he was on the left-hand side of the pavement—that is the same side as the public-house and the opposite side to Coxson s—he then crossed over and went to the door of the public-house—he had not to pass Coxson s door to go to the public-house—Coxson s door is near to the public-house—I cannot say how near—it is on a slant—I never saw Stebbings on Coxson s side at all—he was standing on the curb and he went to the furthest door of the public-house—from one door to the other—I walked on and did not see any more—he was standing still when I saw him—I did not notice anybody with the van—I did not stay there above two or three minutes—I went on leaving the van there and him too Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Though you crossed over to look at the van you went on directly and did not stop A No—whether there were any persons in Coxson s house or with the van I do not know MARY POTTER I was going with Weatherfield on Friday evening about ten minutes to six o clock for some dripping and saw my father s van—I know it to be his—it was about six doors from Coxson s shop—Stebbings was with the van—he was standing on the left-hand side of it when I first saw him—on the left-hand side of the street which is Coxson s side—he was close to the van and reaching up but I do not know what he was doing—Weatherfield remained with me the whole time—I do not know whether she noticed it—she might not have noticed that—he put his hand into the van and touched the butter firkin but I do not know what he did not it Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You were not before the Justice A No—I was told on Tuesday that I was to be a witness—I went to the Thames Police but I was not examined—only two or three words—they did not asked me much—I was not sworn—I did not say I saw Stebbings with the van near Coxson s—they only asked me two or three questions—I heard Weatherfield examined and heard her say she only saw him on the other side GEORGE ELLIS I am a Thames police-officer After receiving information of this robbery I went on Monday the 14th of November to Stebbings house in Cable-street with the prosecutor and Mr Sayre—I found him at home and asked him if he had not lent his van out on the Friday previous—he said he had—I asked him to whom—he said to a stranger—I asked what time it was let out—he said about four o clock—I asked what time he returned—he said about eight—I asked when he was paid for the hire of the van—he said the man paid him when he brought the van home at eight o clock—I asked who got the van ready—he said he assisted—I said Then you will be able to give me some description of the person who hired the van —he said he was dressed something like a carter—I said Why you seem to have had a good deal to do with him you can give me a bettter description —he then said he had been in his company once or twice in a public-house—I then said Why I understand your van stood some considerable time in Wellclose-square —he said It stands up the ride there —I then took him into custody and told him it was on suspicion of being concerned in taking the butter away—I do not know that I told him who I was—after taking him away I went to the ride where the van was in Wellclose-square—I found a van there with the name of John Potter on it—I examined the floor of the van and found the distinct marks of fifteen tubs on it in three rows five in each row—they appeared to be all of the same size—we measured them—Mr Sayre and Mr Webb measured some casks afterwards—I should think a person might run from Brewer s Quay to the ride in ten minutes—it is about half a mile—on Thursday the 17th I went with Mr Sayre and Mr Webb to Coxson s house on the other side of the way—it is not directly opposite—there is a public-house opposite and the clock-house itself is a public-house—Coxson keeps a chandler s shop and sells butter—I found him behind the counter—I told him there had been butter lost and I had come with a search-warrant to search his house—he told me he knew nothing about it I was very welcome to search—I directed Mr Webb and Mr Sayre to look round the shop at the butter—Webb looked at a firkin which stood at the door tried it and said This is precisely the same quality of butter as I have lost—I was then standing behind the counter with Coxson and behind me I took a lid off a keg which was full of butter—Webb and Sayre tried it and said it was precisely the same quality as the other—we found other butter in the shop but not of that description—there was not a large quantity there—I then asked Coxson who he purchased that butter of —he said of Harben and Larkin Whitechapel—I asked him if he had a bill of parcels of it—he said he had but did not know where to find it then—I said I was in no hurry if I waited till six o clock in the evening—he then said To be blunt with you I shall answer you no more questions —I searched his house but found nothing else—I then took him into custody and took charge of the butter which I have here COURT Q Then there are only two casks which they challenge as being the same quality A No—there were only two or three other casks I believe but they were Dutch butter as I am given to understand—there are a great many other butter-shops in the same street—the nearest butter-shop to his is within a very few yards I think and there is one nearly opposite Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did you say a word before the Magistrate about Stebbings saying he had been in the man s company to whom he let the van A My words before the Magistrate were that he had been in his company once or twice at a public-house—my deposition was read over to me before I signed it—I cannot say whether those words were read over to me—I cannot exactly charge my memory—the floor of the van is wood and was very dirty and wet Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Where was the butter Mr Webb claimed A The firkin stood at the shop door—it was not a cask—it stood close to the open door—I had every facility afforded me in searching the house—I told Coxson to overhaul all his papers before he told me he should not answer any more questions—I have seen him in his business there for about two years—I never heard any harm of him—I understand he has been there eight or ten years—I should think there are half-a-dozen butter-shops opposite his COURT Q How close is the nearest butter-shop to his house A I think his mother-in-law keeps a shop of the same description within a door or two of him—he does not manage her business JOHN SAYRE I am a cheesemonger and live at No 79 Shadwell On Monday morning I went to Stebbings house with Ellis and Mr Webb—I saw Stebbings before they did and asked him if he could let me a horse and van on hire—he said he could—he said What sort of goods do you want to convey household or other sort of goods —I said that was immaterial I wished to ask if he had let his horse and van on the Friday previous—he said he had—I said To whom —he said he did not know—I said What sort of description was the man —he said Rather a stout man —I said Was he fair or dark —he said he did not know for he was a perfect stranger—I said Of course if you did not know the person you let the van to you sent some of your servants what it —he said he did not—I immediately went out and fetched Mr Webb and Ellis—Ellis said it was strange he should let his horse to a stranger—he said he had known the man—after some talking together he said he had known the man by seeing him in public-houses—he did not say how often in my hearing—I afterwards went and examined the van—I had seen part of the casks the prosecutor had purchased at his own residence—I saw the floor of the van and observed fifteen distinct marks of the bottoms of casks—I measured the diameter of the marks and found they corresponded with one of the casks which I had at home with some of the same description of butter which I had bought and which came out of the same ship—I gave Mr Webb the measurement of the rings in the van—I went to Coxson s house on the Thursday following in company with Ellis and saw some better—there was Leer firkin standing at the door—I examined it and found the butter quite a different quality to Leer butter and difficulty packed—Leer is on the borders of Prussia—I found it was Mecklenburgh butter in a Leer cask—behind the counter there was a Sligo Keg of Mecklenburgh butter—it was precisely the same sort as that in the Leer firkin—I weighed it afterwards and the two together made within 2lbs or 3lbs of one cask—I asked Coxson where he had bought the butter—he said the fact was he should not answer that question—I asked him if he had a bill of parcels—he said he could not find it—I said Of course you have bought it recently—you will tell me where you bought it —he did not answer me but Ellis put the question and he said he bought it of Harben and Larkin COURT Q Do I understand you the quantity found in both the keg and cask together would make within 2lbs or 3lbs of one Mecklenburgh cask A Yes the keg was nearly full—he was pressed to show the bill of parcels and he said he could not find it—Ellis said he would wait—he then said To be blunt I shall not answer your questions —it is very unusual to re-pack butter to retail it Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Did you and Ellis and Webb go into the house at the same time A Yes—I heard Ellis question him but did not hear all he asked—Ellis went in first I followed after him but not immediately—I was desired to stand near the door—Coxson said You may search my premises —that was after I had questioned him—he gave Ellis a candle to search—he said repeatedly he should not answer any more questions—I have been in the butter-trade twenty-four or twenty-five years—I had no interest in this butter—it never belonged to me—Leer butter is a very different flavour to Mecklenburgh—I have never said it was similar—Leer is much coarser and 2d per lb less—there is a very large quantity of Mecklenburgh butter imported to this country—I found no other Mecklenburgh butter in the shop—I found a keg of Dutch butter more than half used—I did not speak to Coxson before Ellis did—when I spoke to him Ellis was standing by the counter by him— looking at the butter —there is an appearance of this butter having been re-packed—it wastes in re-packing and will never show the same—we can always tell when it has been re-packed—the firkin stood at the door with the head on it and the keg behind the counter had a head over it—it did not appear to have been touched after being re-packed WILLIAM LARKIN I am a wholesale cheesemonger in partnership with Harben and son in High-street Whitechapel I have been thirty years in the trade—Coxson dealt with us—on the 24th of October he bought a firkin and keg of Leer butter of us—I did not sell him any Mecklenburgh—the butter produced I think is German or Danish it is not Leer—I am not a sufficient judge to say whether it is Mecklenburgh—it has been re-packed—it is not Sligo butter—it is not the butter I sold him—I do not think I have sold him any Mecklenburgh for the last twelve months—there is not a considerable resemblance between Leer and Mecklenburgh but when butter is crushed and put down in that state it is impossible to tell—I am persuaded it is not the butter I sold him Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q You cannot swear this is Mecklenburgh butter A It would not keep for twelve months—I have not sold him any to my recollection—it comes in larger packaged than he generally buys—there is no similarly between Leer and Mecklenburgh when in the original packaged but when crushed in this way it is impossible to tell in my opinion—I should say this is foreign butter—it is not Irish nor yet Leer—it is a higher colour than Leer generally is but the colour will be affected by re-packing—this butter is about the same quantity as that I sold him about four weeks ago—I had dealt with him seven years I should say—he always paid ready money—his character had been perfectly good with our house JURY Q What proof have you that is is not the butter you sold him A It is not the firkin—my butter was solid when it went to him—this has been taken out of the cask and crushed—I cannot tell the exact quantity I sold him MR DOANE Q From the appearance of the butter can you undertake to say the two parcels are the same description of butter A I should say they are THOMAS WEBB re-examined I bought more of this butter than the quantity in the cart—Mr Sayre gave me the measure of the prints at he bottom of the van—I compared that with the remaining casks at Brewer s Quay and they correspond—five were left behind and I had sent five away before—I tasted it before I bought it and have tasted this—I have been in the trade about sixteen years—I consider this Mecklenburgh-keel butter such as I bought and tasted—I can distinguish between Leer and Mecklenburgh—this is Mecklenburgh according to my opinion—I sell it retail—I never knew butter unpacked and re-packed in the trade—it is highly injurious to the butter—the value of the property I lost is 70l and upwards—I found my horse and cart afterwards MR DOANE Q Have you any partner A No—I brought twenty-five casks and my brother-in-law bought some JAMES COOK I am a policeman I took Sarles into custody in Stabbings house THOMAS WEBB re-examined It is the same kind of butter I lost but I would not swear to it was mine The same kind

killing with intent to steal the carcass RICHARD THOMAS I am a farmer and reside at Dulwich I have some sheep and lambs On the 25th of November on my return home in the evening I was informed a lamb was missing—they were at grass—my shepherd brought me several slips of the skin—the legs were attached to it and the feet—I have no doubt it was the skin of my lamb—I traced one letter on it—I have no doubt it is mine—I know neither of the prisoners JAMES WRIGHT I am a gamekeeper of Dulwich-common I was on watch at Mr Thomas s field—I found some slips of skin on the 25th of November in the middle of the day in the College-wood—I went down to the farm and spoke to the shepherd and he looked after the lamb SAMUEL PICKETT I am the prosecutor s shepherd On Friday the 25th of I received information—I had counted my lambs on the 24th—I looked at them when the keeper came and missed one—I saw the pieces of skin that were shown to my master—there is no doubt but it was the skin of the lamb that was missing JAMES BARKER I am a policeman On Tuesday the 29th I went to No 24 Pitt-street Bowyer-lane Camberwell—Robertson occupied a room there—in a box under the bed I found part of the carcass of a lamb and in the cupboard a leg of lamb dressed with a lot of suet with it—I took it away and brought it to the station-house—I went directly back with two more officers and found a quantity of turnips and this shoe under the beds which exactly fitted the marks in the field where the lamb had been slaughtered—it is a remarkable shoe—there is a piece out of the sole which exactly corresponds with the marks and a nail in the sole as well—on the 30th of I went to Arlett s house which is about fifty yards from Robertson s—I found a quantity of suet and some caul-fat which appeared he same as I found at Robertson s—I found a clasp-knife in Arlett s pocket when I searched him and another officer found in his house a hatchet—here is a quantity of grass on the shoe as if it came just out of the field JAMES SIMONS I am a policeman I accompanied Barker to Robertson s and saw the shoe found—I did not go to the field—I afterwards went to Arlett s and found a shirt stained with blood on the left shoulder and a smock-frock also—I took one waistcoat off him in Horsemonger-lane which had marks of blood on in the same place as the shirt and so had his other waistcoats Arlett It was my nose which bled in the night that did it WILLIAM WATSON I am a policeman I was at the station-house—I saw Barker bring in four joints of lamb—I accompanied him back again to Robertson s house and saw him find part of a leg of lamb and a knuckle of lamb—the next day the lamb was shown to Mr Thomas—the skin and some joints were brought from Mr Thomas and the joints tallied exactly—we compared the fat found at the prisoner s—it appeared to tally in quantity exactly and the knuckle that had been cooked tallied with that in the skin—I observed some particular cuts in the chopping down the neck of it—it appeared to have been done by a hatchet and not by a butcher Robertson I wish it to be shown to see whether it is lamb or mutton that he found at my house Witness Here is the shoulder bone SAMUEL WRIGHT I am a policeman I accompanied Barker to search Arlett s house—I went into the back room and found a chopper and saw—they had blood and far upon them—I compared the chopper with the neck of the meat—it exactly correspond with it WILLIAM COLTON I am a policeman I accompanied Wright to Arlett s—I saw this hatchet compared with the cuts on the neck of the meat—it appeared to fit exactly CHARLOTTE JOHNSON The prisoner Robertson lodged with me in the room which the officer searched—I have seen him in company with the other prisoner several times Robertson s Defence The meat which was found in my house was mutton which I had purchased—I brought the leg neck and breast in New-gate-market on Friday morning—I gave 5d a lb —the other I bought in Lambeth-walk and gave 5 1/2d a lb —the whole came to 8s and some odd pence—I do not know the people I bought it of—it was a butcher s-shop in the centre of the market Arlett s Defence On Sunday night the 27th of November I was in bed with my wife and children when I heard myself called by name—I was asked whether I had borrowed a water tub of Robertson—I called out that I had not and returned to bed—should I not have removed these articles which they found at my house had I been conscious of any thing wrong On Wednesday the officer came and took me in my house—it has been stated that part of a sheep s head and less than 1/4lb of suet were found at my house—and the policeman would allow it was found in my cupboard in a paper flour bag—they will admit they emptied out the flour and having separated the suet

1400lbs weight of butter value 70l the goods of Thomson Webb MR BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution THOMAS WEBB I am a cheesemonger and live in Tottenham-court-road I made a purchase of some Meck Lenburgh Keil butter at Brewers Quay—it takes its name from the place it is shipped from Keil—on the 11th of November I sent my lad Peacock with a cart and horse for fifteen casks—I have since seen some of the butter at the premises of a man named Coxson—I know it by the peculiarity of the favour—it was then packed in a different cask to what it generally is Cross-examined by MR JONES Q Did not one of the Jury on the former trial ask you if you could swear to the butter and you said No A Yes MR BALLANTINE Q In what sort of a cask was it A It was in a Sligo keg and a Leer firkin—Mecklenburgh butter is 2d a pound dearer than Sligo which is much salter WILLIAM PEACOCK On the 11th of November I was in Mr Webb s service I was sent by him to get some butter from Brewers Quay with a horse and cart—it was delivered to me—there were twelve casks in the body of the cart and three on the copse in quarter casks—in all fifteen firkins—as I was driving away a man came running up to me at Billingspte and said something in consequence of which I returned to Brewers Quay—when I came back I found the horse cart and butter gone—the person who spoke to me had on a pair of corduroy trowsers and a fustian jacket very much torn—he was a very dirty-looking man and was pitted with the small-pox—I had seen him at work on Brewers Quay which made me think it was right—the horse and cart were afterwards found at Day s livery-stables in King David-lane Shadwell MARGARET GREGORY On the 11th of November I was living with Mr Stebbings at No 65 Cable-street On the afternoon of that day the prisoner Collins came there along with a man who is known by the name of Upright Charley—he said I understand you have got a horse and cart to let —Stebbings said The cart is out my partner has got it out —Collins said Do you know where I can get one —Stebbings said You can got one at Hall s the green-shop three doors down —Collins and Upright Charley then went away—they returned in two or three minutes and said they could not set one these it was out—Stebbings said My partner s van is in the stable if that will do I will lead it to you and he went out with them—in about a quarter of an hour Stebbings returned alone—that was about half-past four o clock in the afternoon I went to the door when Collins and Upright Charley went away and saw the prisoner Bowles and another young man whose clothes were all torn off him his elbows were all out and he was freckled with the small-pox he had a fustian jacket and corduroy trowsers and was very dirty he had a low-crowned white hat with a broad brim and was bigger them either of the prisoners—they went the same way as Stebbings Collins and Upright Charley—I saw them walk close up to one another but did not see them speak—I saw them join directly after Stebbings Collins and Charley went away—Stebbings walked on first and the other four were all together—they were in company—I went to the door and saw them turn round Shorter-street which leads into Well-close-square which is when Stebbings s partner kept his van—I saw the four men together for about five minutes—they were all four together in a line—about half an hour after as near as I can guess when Stebbings was at tea and I was in the shop I saw Potter s van and Stebbings s horse—Potter is Stebbings s partner—the van was full of tubs—Upright Charley was by the horse and Collins was by the cart—I did not see any one else—I was going out at the time and saw the van go up Rosemary-lane and stop at Coxson s—I saw Upright Charley take one cask out first and take it into Coxson s—Collins at that time was standing by the horse s head—I then saw Charley come out and take another cask out and take it in—I then went on to where I was going—Charley said to Coxson in Collins s hearing Are not you going to have the other two —Coxson said No I will not have them as you have brought the van up to the door I will not have more than two or else I would have had the four —Collins was about a yard from Coxson at the time the conversation took place and must have heard what was said—about two hours or more after I was at Stebbings s house and Bowles and the ragged man came to the door—Bowles said Mistress is the van come back yet —I did not make any answer then as I was serving-they went and stood a little distance from the door—Bowles came again and said Mistress is the van come back —I said No —he said I am not going to be done out of it in no such a way and the ragged ran said I am not going to be done out of it —they stood quarrelling with each other—the ragged one said I am not going to be done out of it after driving it away and Bowles answered he was not going to be dm out of his regulars—when I said the van was not come back Bowles said I want the young man who borrowed the van Upright Charley Cross-examined Q When did you first tell all this story A At the Thames police-office three weeks ago—it was after Stebbings was tried here—I was told my evidence would not be taken before—I offered to become a witness when Stebbings was first taken because he was having his tea when the van went past the door—I did not think to get him off—I went to see Stebbings on the Tuesday as he went away on the Wednesday and after that I went to Mr Webb—I did not go in consequence of what Stebbings said to me Q Do not you expect to get Stebbings off with a slight imprisonment if you can fix it on these men A No—I cannot say I can get him off—I do not want to convict these men—I do not want to get Stebbings off—he is not my man—I do not expect to get him off—how can I get him off —I do not think of doing so by giving evidence against these men—I have never thought of it—I was only housekeeper to Stebbings—I have not been promised that endeavours should be made to get him off if I gave evidence against these men—no one has told me 1 might get some of Stebbings s punishment off if I did so—of course I should be glad to get Ms punishment remitted but not by convicting these men—I did not tell Mr Webb all I knew about it only part of it—I did not tell him say thing—I only went to show him a letter—Cook the police—sergeant was the first person I told of it—I saw him going past the door and called him in—I told him some part of it and told the rest at the Thames police about three weeks ago—the letter I showed Mr Webb was from Stebbings—it was a letter to me Q Did the young man with Bowles appear like a working young man A yes— Bowles had the same clothes on he has now—he did not say he was employed by Stebbings and the other man to help with the casks—he said he would be paid for his work—he said he would have his regulars—I have never heard wages called regulars—Margaret Gregory is my right was—I have never gone by any other—I was called Stebbings but I never went by any other name besides—I lived with Stebbings seven years as housekeeper—he paid me regular wages—he gave me money and clothes—he gave me

casually in the street—I had known her before—she was a servant out of place Q How are you getting your living now A I keep the shop on—I would not for the sake of saving Stebbings convict these men—I could not do that—I have never said I would give evidence against them if they would allow me to go after Stebbings—I have not applied to go after him—I never asked to go out to New South Wales as his wife—I swear that HENRY WILLIAMS On the 11th of November I lived in harles—court near Well—close—square—Potter the owner of the van was my master between three and four o clock that afternoon I was waiting for master and saw Stebbings Collins and another man dressed in fustian clothes—he was a tall fair man—I did not hear him called by any name—it was from three to half-past or four o clock when I went to my tea—just after the van had gone I looked at the clock and it was half—past three or twenty minutes to four o clock—I followed the van to go home—they harnessed the horse in great haste and made a mistake by putting a breeching on where the reach chain goes along—Collins jumped up into the van and laid hold of the reins—Stebbings was up the ride still standing at the stable door—he said Where is the whip —I said Master has got it but here is one of his old whips —he said Let us have it —I gave it to him and he handed it to Collins who then drove off—Stebbings and the other man walked on the Pavement round Well—close—square in the same direction—I did not see any thing of Bowles Cross-examined Q Did Stebbings and the other man keep close up to the cart A They were on the pavement and the van was going on as fast as the old mare could go—Stebbings and the other kept up to it—they walked—the mare could not go fast as she was old—it was about half-past three o clock—I looked at the clock because I wanted to go home as master did not come—Stebbings knew the mare could not go fast CHARLES JONES I am keeper of the toll-gate in Cable-street New-road—it is about half-a-mile from Thames-street going down towards Lime house—Stebbings house is about two or three hundred yards from the gate On the 11th of November about six o clock in the evening a cart passed through my gate—there were tube in it and three on the copse which goes over the horse s loins—Sarles who was tried here was driving the cart-Collins was walking on the pavement and he made a stop when he came to came to me—I noticed a mole on his cheek at the time and have no doubt at all of him—he said something to me I cannot say what it was and went on I cannot say who paid the toll—the cart was going from Stebbings s down towards Sun Tavern-fields—they could not get to Stebbings s house again without coming back through my gate unless they went round—I knew Coxson s house in Rosemary-lane Q If the cart did not pass through your gate to get to Coxson s would it pass by Stebbings s A No—they could get up the highway up a street to Coxson s Cross-examined Q It was pretty well dark was it not when the cart went through A Yes—I never saw Collins before that night to my recollection—I noticed him particularly because they sent the cart on in a hurry and the one who was taken paid me the toll—Collins made a stop and said something—he then went on and the other paid the toll JANE SYDIE I reside facing Coxson s shop On the 11th of November about seven or half-past seven o clock I observed a van draw up to his door—the tall fair man was with the van and Collins—I saw the tall fair man take a cask out of the van and put it into Coxson s shop—I had before that in the afternoon between four and half-past four o clock saw Collins with the same man facing my window a little way from Coxson s shop—they stood talking a few yards from the shop—the tall man then left Collins and went into Coxson s where he staid about five minutes—he then came out and they both went away together down Rosemary-lane Cross-examined Q Had you ever seen Collins before that day A No but I saw him next day go past in the same street—I was alone-the tall fair man appeared to have the management of the van—he drove it and took something into the shop leaving Collins outside—I have seen Gregory and have spoken to her before but had no acquaintance with her—I am single and live with my father JURY Q How far is your house from Coxson s A At that time I lived right facing Coxson s just across the road—we can see from our window right into Coxson s shop—I was at the window of the second pair front room when I saw this COURT Q Is there any gas opposite there A Yes at the corner

Stebbings s house—the cart was found in Sun-Tavern fields and after it had been standing there a few hours some body went to Day s and put it up there at livery—the turnpike would be in the way to Sun-Tavern fields—I had not far to run back to the Quay—I ran as hard as I could—the man said he would look to the cart while I was gone—he had no hat on when he came up to me MR JONES On behalf of Collins contended that the evidence if true went more to substantiate a case of receiving than of stealing the property COLLINS— GUILTY of larceny Aged 22 — Transported for Seven Years BOWLES— NOT

of January I obtained a search warrant and went to the house of Sarah Price in Fair-lane Edmonton and saw her and Mason—on searching the cupboard of the room they were in down stairs 1 found the head the heart and part of the lights of a sheep raw and fresh—it had the appearance of being fresh killed—I went up stairs into the bed-room and in a box there I found the legs shoulders part of the neck and part of the loin fresh killed—I found five other joints hanging on hooks in the bed-room not concealed—there was a loin a neck and two pieces of the breast—I went into the garden but did not find the skin there—I found a sack on the floor of the room they were in marked R B Smith and another sack in a cupboard in the same room marked Judd Edmonton and a pewter pot—I told Price I must take her into custody for hating the meat there—the laid the knew nothing about it as her sons brought it there while she and Mason were at Edmonton on Saturday night—this was Sunday morning between ten and eleven o clock—Mason said it was a bad job—they were taken to Edmonton watch-house—I know Mrs Price rented the house and Mason lived there and William and Charles Price also—I afterwards went to Maria Julph s house in Bury-street Edmonton and as I was going to the door Charles Price came from the door—I asked him if his name was Julph—he said no it was not—I told him he roust come into Mrs Julph s house with me—when the door was opened Mrs Julph stood against it—I asked her if her name was Julph—she said no it was not—I asked her if Mrs Julph lived there—she said No she lives further down the street —the prisoner Thomas Julph then came into the room—I asked him if his name was not Julph—he said Yes —I told them I had a warrant to search the house for some mutton—Mrs Julph replied that I could not search the house on a Sunday— she is the mother of the prisoner David —on searching the back bed-room down stairs I found four or five joints of mutton in a dish in the cupboard and in the back washhouse I found four or five other joints and a sack and in the same place the skin of a sheep in a bag—I found the entrails of a sheep fresh killed down the privy—the sheep was without head or feet—the joints made up the entire body short of the head and feet except some pieces which were in the pot cooking for dinner JOHN KENT I am a policeman On the Monday morning I searched for the skin of the sheep and found one in the New River at Highfield-row—I compared it with the head of a sheep produced by Smith—they corresponded so as to enable me to speak positively to its being the head of the same sheep as the skin belonged to—it fitted the head RICHAID BOOTH SMITH I am a fanner and live at Huxley farm Edmonton I saw my sheep safe in the gravel-pit field at four o clock on Saturday afternoon the 31st of December—next morning about nine o clock I was in the field and missed two sheep—one of them was a ewe—I found the head and feet of a sheep in the field—I traced it by blood to the corner of my stack-yard—in consequence of information I obtained a search-warrant by means of which the mutton was discovered at Price s—traced blood round in the direction of Price s house—I compared the skit found by Kent in the New River with the head found at Price s house and I could ascertain they formed part of the same animal and there were parts of the carcass on which the wool was left—part of the skin was left on the mutton at Price s which exactly corresponded with the skin—4t was the skin of one of my sheep and the other found at Julph s was also the skin of a sheep I lost—I found the head and feet in the field corresponded with the skin found at Julph s—the mutton at both places had part of the skin left which agreed with it—one skin has my initial on it near the hip and the other has a star branded on the same spot SIMON SMITH re-examined While I was searching Julph s house William Price came in and then David Julph—I then said I must lock them all up with Mrs Julph as I had found the mutton there RICHARD CARTER I am a constable I searched Charles Price—he had two smock-frocks on—the outer one was saturated with blood apparently quite fresh when I took it off him—the knee of his trowsers was split and the lining of the knee was all bloody RICHARD BOOTH SMITH re-examined I traced the footmarks of four persons driving the sheep into a pit and out of it into the snow-two of them were boys shoes and two small-sized men s-none of them were large—the tracks led to the corner where the sheep was slaughtered and out again and ended on the high-road where I first tracked the blood and the blood went from there to Price s house all the way—I can undertake to say they were not women s feet SIMON SMITH re-examined I followed the tracks of blood down Fair-lane—there were traces of blood to Price s house and on to Julph s and there was blood in the washhouse at Julph s—the prisoners shoes were clean I did not compare the footmarks HENRY JOHN SAWYER I was present at the prisoners examination before Mr Edward Roe Mores the Magistrate—I took down the deposition and examination in his presence—I took down what the partial said nearly verbatim—I believe it was word for word-this examination of David Julph is in my hand-writing—I took it down from his mouth-this is the Magistrate s signature to it—I read it over to David Julph and explained it to him—I told him it would be given in evidence against him and he put his name to it after that—hesaid it was right when I read it—I also took down what William Price stated—hewas cautioned that it would be used against him in the Magistrate s presence—hestated what I took down and it was read over to him—I asked him whether be would sign it or not—hesaid I shall not sign it -When I read it over to him I asked him whether it was right and he said Yes —I recollect putting that question—I told him to listen to what I had taken down and if there was any thing wrong in it to correct me—hedid not object to it on account of its being incorrectly taken—I do not know why he refused to sign it—I am quite sure he was asked whether it was correct or right the Magistrate said Well Mr Sawyer he says it is right but refused to sign it-so put that down looking at the examination this was truly taken from his lips read The prisoner David Julph having been cautioned not to say any thing to criminate himself and being asked whether he is guilty or not says I took the sheep—I and my brother and the two Prices Charles and William went into the field of Mr Richard Booth Smith about seven o clock in the evening on Saturday last—it was the gravel-pit field-we had made up our minds just before twelve o clock to go and take the two sheep—William and Charles Price and my brother Thomas met me in Bury-street and asked me to go with them—I at first refused but after much persuasion I consented to do so-Charles Price first asked me then William asked me and afterwards my brother Thomas-when we got into the field we caught two sheep—I and my brother killed one-and the two Prices took theirs away alive-we left the head and feet in the field-we took our sheep home and skinned it there and gutted it there-my mother was gone to bed the door was open she usually left it open-on getting home we cut it up with a knife and chopper-we then put it into a cupboard below stairs in a back bed-room—I put the skin into a bag and some joints into another sack wrapped in a cloth-we put the entrails down the privy Signed D JULPH The prisoner William Price having been cautioned not to say any thing that might criminate himself and being asked whether he it guilty or not guilty says I am alone guilty—I do not know my brother s age—on Saturday last I was at home I slept at home that night with my brother Charles and another younger brother—the mutton was brought home to my mother s house—when she was out about seven o clock in the evening—I killed skinned the sheep in Mr Booth

70l the goods of Thomson Webb MR BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution THOMSON WEBB I am a cheesemonger and live in Tottenham-court-road I had purchased 25 quarter casks of butter part of which I had away—on the 11th of November I sent Peacock to Brewer s Quay for 15 quarter casks with a horse and cart—it was Mecklenburg Keil butter which is a butter of a peculiar flavour—I saw my horse and cart again next day at a livery stable in the neighbourhood of Sun Tavern-fields—on the 17th of November I went to Coxson s shop in Rosemary-lane and saw some butter in a Sligo keg and a Leer firkin of exactly the same quality as I lost—I tasted it—Mecklenburg butter is more expensive than Sligo and would not be put in a Sligo cask—it appeared as if it had been very hastily packed Cross-examined by MR JONES Q You prosecuted Coxson for receiving it A Yes—he was acquitted—I said I could not swear to the butter being mine—I am positive it was Mecklenburg Keil butter WILLIAM PEACOCK On the 11th of November Mr Webb sent me to Brewer s Quay with a horse and cart to fetch some butter about two o clock or a little after—I drove it to Billingsgate when a man came up to me and in consequence of what he said I returned to Brewers Quay—when I came back the horse and cart which I had left at Billingsgate was gone—I had 15 quarter casks 12 in the body of the cart and 3 on the copse over the horse s head MARGARET GREGORY On the 11th of November I lived in the house of stebbings in Cable-street leading out of Rosemary-lane—about half-past four o clock that afternoon the prisoner came there along with Collins who was convicted last sessions —I have known the prisoner for eight years—he said I understand you have a horse and cart to let —Stebbings said The cart is out —the prisoner said Do you know where I can get one —Stebbings said Two or three doors off —the prisoner and Collins then went away—they came back in about three minutes and said they could not get one—Stebbings said My partnet s van is in the stable if that will do you can have it —they said that would do and Stebbings went away with them—he was away about a quarter of an hour—about two hours and a half after I saw Potter s van and Stebbings s horse going up Rosemary-lane—the van seemed full of butter firkins—the prisoner and Collins were with it—I was going out at the time—it stopped at the corner of Cartwright-street by Coxson s door—I saw the prisoner come to the van take one cask out and take it into Coxson s—Collins was standing by the hone s head on the pavement—the prisoner then came and took another in and was coming to the van again for more when Coxson stopped him and said I won t have any more as you have brought the van to the door or else I would have had four Cross-examined Q You were housekeeper to Stebbings were you A Yes—I have not got another place—I told the Magistrate it was the prisoner I saw with the butter that was after Stebbings was convicted—I could not find him or else I should have done it before but when I went to Clerkenwell to see Stebbings Coxson used to beg of me not to say any thing as he knew I knew most about it—I should have told if the prisoner had been found—I certainly should like to see Stebbings back again but it is impossible—I do not expect to get him back by doing any thing to this man—I expect to do it by petitioning—I have not accused other people wrongfully—I do not expect to get Stebbings off by convicting this man—I do not want to convict him—I do not expect to get him off by petitioning but I may get his sentence mitigated—I do not care whether the prisoner gets off or not—I have said nothing but the truth—there is a petition gone in for Stebbings Mr Dowries an attorney drew it up—a gentleman named Hay employed him to do it as I did not know any thing about it—I am not housekeeper to Mr Hay—he is old enough to be my grandfather—the petition was not read over to me—I do not know what was in it—this is the second time I have been here—I do not expect to get any money by being a witness I do not want any—I got 3s 6d a day for being a witness the last time—I got 15s 6d altogether—I have had no money from any one else—I lived with Stebbings for seven yean—I did not have wages I had the handling of the money HENRY WILLIAMS On the 11th of November I lived in Harrod s-alley Wellclose-square On the afternoon of that day I was waiting for my master Mr Potter who keeps a van and saw Stebbings Collins and the prisoner come up the horse-ride together—Stebbings wrenched the padlock off the stable-door where his own hone and master s were kept and said to me Now I want the cart I suppose I cannot have it —he said to the prisoner and Collins Will a van do they answered Yes —with that Stebbings opened the gate where the van was kept and drew it out—I held up the shafts—he harnessed the horse in a great hurry and put the breeching on wrong—Collins jumped up into the van and laid hold of the reins—I said to Stebbings There is no whip at home master has it out here is only this old piece of stick —he said Let us have it —he handed it to Collins up in the van and Collins drove off—the prisoner and Stebbings walked on the

came out and they went away together down the lane—about seven o clock or a little after the same evening I saw the prisoner draw the van up to Coxson s door—he took a cask out of the van and put it down at the side of the counter in the shop—he then came out and drove the van away—Collins was with him and stood by the horse—I have known the prisoner a long while—they used to call him Upright

with my father—I work at the tailoring—I know nothing of Gregory—I used to visit at Stebbings s when I was a child but have not lately CHARLES JONES On the 11th of November I was keeper of the New road gate formerly called Cable-street On the evening of that day I saw a horse and cart drive through the gate about six o clock I believe it was getting dusk but I did not look at any clock—I have since seen the hone and cart at the Thames police it was Mr Webb s—when it passed through the gate the bottom of it was full of tubs and three were on the top of the copse—the prisoner and Collins were with it—the prisoner staid behind and paid me the toll—he stood with me four or five minutes—we had a few words together concerning the toll—it is a new gate put up—he said I have paid toll here many a day but never paid at this gate —the cart was going to wards Sun Tavern-fields Cross-examined Q Was it light or dark A Just in the dusk of the evening—I had no light—it is only a new gate

t18370227-722  722 CHARLES BRADFIELD was indicted for stealing on the 30th of December at St Mary Stratford-le-Bow 1 mare price 351 the property of Hamilton Gill MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution EDWARD KEENE I am fifteen years old and am in the service of Mr Hamilton Gill I remember about Christmas it being very snowy weather—I locked the stable-door about half-past five o clock—the night before the horse was lost and hung the key up in the house—the chestnut mare was safe in the stable at that time—I went to the stable next morning at six o clock and found the door open and the mare gone—the lock was off the door and hanging by one screw—I have since seen the mare at Worship-street in the officer s possession MR HAMILTON GILL I live at Shenley lodge near South Mimms in Hertfordshire On the morning of the 30th of December I received information from my servant—I went to the stable found it broken open and missed the mare—I consider the value of it about 35l —there were marks on the stable door as if it had been forced with some instrument—there was snow on the ground—I looked about and observed the marks of the horse s feet and of men s feet—there were marks of more than one man s feet—they pointed from the gate to the house and from the house into the high road again—about a fortnight afterwards I received information from George Osborne in consequence of which I came to town and saw the mare in his stables—the mare belonged to ray brother but had been in my care about two years—she was not clipped before I lost her—she was a darkish chestnut with rather a long switch tail—when I found her at Osborne s she had been clipped and had a short Docked tail—clipping a horse alters its appearance a little—it would prevent its answering a description which the owner gave of it—if a black horse is clipped it becomes a lighter colour—I have known a grey horse clipped and part of it was black and part mouse colour—it depend on the colour of the skin—I knew my mare again perfectly well Prisoner Q Was the mare lame when you had her A Sometimes he was but she had been in the stable a long time—I do not know whether she was lame when she was stolen—she has never been in harness to my knowledge—I do not know that she was a roarer MR CLARKSON Q Would 9l 10s be a fair value for her A I should say certainly not WILLIAM HENRY BUSH I am a horse-clipper and live at Stratford in Essex On the 30th of December about eleven or half-past eleven o clock in the morning the prisoner came to my house—I was not at home and he sent for me—I saw him at the Harrow public-house—I have known him three or four years—he asked me if I could clip a horse for him—I said I could—he said he had not yet purchased the horse that she belonged to a little man inside that there was 10s between them and he dare say he should have her or he intended to have her—he said he wanted it done as quick as possible for he wanted to show her—I went to the White Horse and Woolpack at Old Ford to Do her—that is about a mile from the Harrow—he went on first—I stopped to get my comb and scissors and then followed him—he told me to come to the White Horse—I went and found him there and there was a little dark man there who looked a good deal like a Jew—I heard the prisoner ask him if he was to have the horse—he said no without he gave him the 10l the prisoner said he would not have it unless 5s or 10s were thrown off I cannot say which—the prisoner agreed to have it of him and something was written on a stamp by the little man which he gave to the prisoner—no money passed between them in my presence—we then all went into the stable together—I found a chestnut mare there—she had been sweated a good deal and was stained with sweat and dirt—she had no shoes on behind and her tail was bleeding having been fresh Docked— I afterwards saw the same horse at Worship-street —the prisoner paid me for the clipping—he walked on to the White Horse before me and a man named Basset who was with him walked with roe to the White Horse—the prisoner could not have got there above two or three minutes before me—I never saw the dark man before—the prisoner and he talked very friendly together but the prisoner told me he was a stranger to him—I should think South Mimms is nineteen or twenty miles from Bow—it it a cross-country road—the prisoner told me he had bought the mare for 9l 10s Prisoner Q Did not I ask the man how long he had had her A Yes—he said he had had her four or five months when she had been turned out in a box and kept on hay—I do not recollect your asking him what made her all over dirt and in such a rough state but I heard him say she had not been cleaned for a long time—I heard the man say two or three days after that it was his brother s mare and he would not have sold her only he was short of money MR BODKIN Q Where was it he said that A At the Eagle in Mile-end-road—Osborne was there at the time—I happened to be in at Osborne s four or five days after the sale of the horse and Basset came in there and shortly afterwards the little man and the prisoner came in GEORGE OSBORNE I am a pork-butcher and live in Wentworth-place Mile-end-road I know the prisoner—on Tuesday the 3rd of January I exchanged a bay horse with him—I received from him a chestnut mare clipped and with a docked tail—on the Monday evening previous I had seen the prisoner with the dark Jewish looking man—Basset came to my house first and then the prisoner and the little man came—it was between five and eight o clock in the evening—Bush was at my house at the time talking to me—I have known him some years—we all went to the Eagle tavern next door but one to me—we stopped there five or ten minutes I believe and had a glass of ale—I came back to my house—we exchanged horses the following day—we had no dealings at the Eagle—we talked about it—there was a difference of opinion between the prisoner and myself at to the value of the horse—I wanted 5l in money for mine and he wanted 5l for his making a difference of 10l —he never gave me the price of his mare as I would not buy her right out—I wished to exchange—my horse was worth about 25l —the prisoner came to my house the following day about one o clock—I believe he was alone—when he came Bush s father and a Mr Green had come to purchase my horse—the witness Bush was not there—the prisoner called in and we all went over to my stable together to look at my horse—Basset and the little man were not there—the prisoner s man who went by the name of Tom was sent by the prisoner for his mare—I have known the prisoner about three years and always understood him to be a horse-dealer—his stables were then at Hackney but I have bought horses of him at stables in town—I do not know that he had any stables at this time—the man brought the mare and we then exchanged one horse for the other—no money was given on either side—shortly afterwards I had suspicions that the mare was stolen—I went to Mr Gill and told him of this—I cannot say whether Basset and the prisoner were in partnership—I have heard the prisoner say they had stables together and paid 8s 6d a week for them—he said so at the time I purchased the horse which I exchanged for Mr Gill s—that was about six weeks before Christmas—I bought that horse of the prisoner out of a stable where Basset s name was on the gate—the prisoner said he and Basset rented the stable together—it was at Hackney or Homerton—I do not know that they rented any stable at the Woolpack Prisoner Q When I went to the Eagle did not the little man say he would not sell her if he was not short of money and that it was his brother s A Yes You told me he had a pony-chaise and harness for sale—I did not hear the little man himself say so—You said he knew more about the mare than you did—he told me he had sold her to you—I had given three sovereigns and a grey mare for the bay horse—the prisoner sold the grey mare to a friend of mine for 15l I understand but when I exchanged that mare it was in poor condition—he did not wish me to buy her but to keep and work her as she was ill—but when I exchanged her with the last one she had got in good condition and was worth more—the chestnut mare was rather low in condition she was lame—her leg was swollen inside—I discovered that she roared a little—I never put her into harness—he told me she would jib in harness but I never tried her MR CLARKSON Q Did you pay him part of the money for the bay horse at Worship-street A Yes I did—when I exchanged the grey more for the bay horse I gave him two sovereigns and was to give him two more if he sold her for only 14l or any thing under—he sold her a few days before his apprehension to Mr Webb for 15l and we settled the difference when he was in custody—Webb has paid for the grey horse since he has been in custody—I think I saw the little man on Saturdays the 31st of December—he must have been either with the prisoner or Basset I cannot say which—I cannot say where it was I saw him I cannot positively say that I did see him but I have a faint recollection that I did—the prisoner and he seemed friendly they were drinking together—but the prisoner said he was a perfect stranger and he did not know who he was—that was on the Monday—the name of the little man did not occur at all—I should say about three weeks previous was the first time I saw Basset he was then with the prisoner—the little man was with us when the prisoner and I exchanged horses WILLIAM HOLLAND I am a policeman On the 26th of January the prisoner was pointed out to me in the parlour of the Cock and Magpie public-house Worship-street by Mr Osborne as the man he had purchased the horse of—I asked him whether he had sold a horse lately to Mr Osborne—he said he had—I asked where he got it from—he said he bought it of a man who he knew well of the name of Jenkins—I asked if he could find him—he said he could—I then told him the horse was stolen and took him into custody—he said I bought it and have got a receipt for it at least my wife has at home —that was all that passed—Osborne was present during the whole conversation—in consequence of what the prisoner said I went to some stables in Worship-street and found a female up stairs who answered to the name of Bradfield and she showed me a paper which I gave her again—the prisoner s solicitor afterwards produced it at the office and it remained in his possession I believe Prisoner Q Should you know the receipt again if you saw it A Yes this is it— looking at it MR CLARKSON Q Was the name of Jenkins to that receipt A No Prisoner s Defence On the Friday morning Basset and the little man came to me about nine or ten o clock—they told me if I would go to the White Horse Old Ford they had got a mare they would sell me—I went and looked—they asked 10l for her—I bid 9l 10s —they said they would not take it and I went away—I thought they would let me have her and I went to Bush and told him I thought I should buy her and to clip her for me as she was very rough—he said he would and charged me 15s which I paid him after he clipped her—when I went back the little man who gave his name Simpson I think said if I liked to give 5s more I should have her—I said I would not give him more and after a little while he said I should have her—I told him if he went home with me I would pay him if he would give me a receipt—he said he had got a stamp in his pocket—he then wrote it out and went home with me and I paid him—I have a witness named Pledger who can prove I was at home on the Friday night it was stolen— receipt read — December 30th 1836—Received of Mr Bradfield the sum of 9l 10s for a chestnut mare with all her faults—W Simpson ROBERT EDWARD FRANCIS I live at Old Ford with my mother who keeps the White Horse and Woolpack public-house I know the prisoner by seeing him at our house—I did not see him give any money for the mare but I saw him dealing for it—there was a receipt passed in our perlour for the mare between the prisoner and a person named Simpkins think—I did not know the man—Tom the prisoner s young man brought the mare there between seven and eight o clock that morning MR CLARKSON Q Did you ever see any dealing for horses at the White Horse before A No—I have been there one Year next May—I never saw the prisoner take any receipt for a horse before—I took this horse in and waited upon them in the parlour—two horses came a chestnut and a grey one—I have not seen the grey since—the horses were very cool and the mare had a cloth on her when she came to our house as though the had just come from a stable—she had no head-cloth—she was not sweated at all nor dirty—the snow was on the ground at the time—she had her two fore-shoes on hut no shoes behind—I believe it was between eleven and twelve o clock when I saw the prisoner—I had not seen him that day before—I don t know where he lived—Basset the little man and the prisoner came in together WILLIAM LOCKWOOD I live at Stratford I saw the prisoner buy the mare at Mrs Francis s at Old Ford of a little man—I can t tell his name—I never saw him before nor since—I saw no money paid but I saw the I receipt given THOMAS WIBB I am a veterinary surgeon and live at Ware I have known the prisoner eight or nine years—I always believed him a very upright man in his dealings—Osborne and the policeman came to me to inquire for the prisoner and I told them where to find him—I went to his home—I found him at a public-house and told him the officers were after him for horse-stealing MR CLARKSON Q Did you buy the grey mare A I did—I had teen her often before I bought her—I don t think I was in town on the 30th or 31st of December—I never was at Old Ford—I am not a horse-dealer and never was—I have no forge at Ware—I have stables for four or fire horses there—I have seen Basset three times—I do not know a man named Simpkins or Jenkins—I know Bush—he has clipped horses for Be—I know Lockwood—he was my father s servant some years—I had bought horses of the prisoner before I bought the grey mare—the grey mare was the last I bought—I did not intend to buy her—I had asked him to look for a horse for me and he said You can take my grey mare and work her till I get another for you but since he has been in prison he wanted the money and I have paid him for it—I have not beard that the grey mare was stolen—nothing of the kind—no inquiries have been made about her—I have known her for years—Osborne had her before he did and before that Searle of Loughton—I cannot say exactly how many horses I have bought of the prisoner—it may be eight or ten and two or three perhaps within the last twelve months for my own use—I went to his house the day he was apprehended but he was not there—I had not seen him before I went there—I saw him about five minutes after I had been there—his house is in a yard in Worship-street—he has an apartment there—when I went there I got a piece of paper from there and burnt it—I went to the house for the prisoner as I was ordered by Osborne and the officer—he was not there—from there I went to the Magpie and Cock—I can explain what the paper was which I burnt—the prisoner wished me to pay him for this mare and asked me to lend him 10l or 15l —I told him at the time it was rather inconvenient but he could have it by-and-by—he said would I accept a bill—I said Certainly —when he was taken into cuatody I said to him That bill of course is of no service to you —he said no and if I asked his wife for it she would give it to me—I then burnt it—it was a bill for 32 which I had lent him about ten day or a fortnight before he was taken—no other name was on the bill but my own and his—I did not notice any name—I did not pay that attention to it—I did not look at the back—the prisoner found the stamp and drew the bill—he did not buy it in my presence—I swear that— I did not notice the amount of the stamp—the bill was written at his own apartment his wife was present at the time it was written but nobody else Q Will you swear that positively A You ask me almost too close a question there—I don t remember any more—I will swear there was not more than one other man present besides myself and him—I don t know that there was another man—I can t say that Basset was there or that he was not Prisoner Q Did not you examine the chestnut mare A I saw her on the Tuesday—I cannot remember the day of the month—she was lame in all four legs and with spavins in both hind legs—there was an enlarge ment on the near fore-leg and a navicular lameness of the off fore-leg and she was a high-blower—a roarer MR CLARKSON Q She was not worth a 5 note I daresay A She was not GEOROE OSBORNE re-examined I have known the prisoner three years and always considered him an honest upright man MR CLARKSON Q Pray had you the good fortune to find any other horse that was stolen A Yes—on the 14th of February since the prisoner has been in custody—it belonged to Mr Packer a surgeon at Hoxton—I understood the prisoner had sold it to Mr Martin—Webb came to my house and I asked his opinion of the chestnut mare—he told me she was not worth 10l and advised me not to buy her Samuel Waldock Great Chesterfield William Ryder smith and

saw him MATTHEW JACKSON I am ostler to Mr Northover who keeps the white Hart in Kingsland-road On Tuesday the 21st of February the prisoner came there between six and seven o clock in the morning and brought the mare and saddle and bridle with him—she was dirty and very hot—he said he wanted her cleaned and wanted some corn for her and told me to wrap her up warm and take care of her—I took her into the stable and cleaned her—about ten o clock he brought Mr Jenkinson to look at her but it would not suit him—I and the prisoner afterwards went into the house together and saw Mr Bateman—the prisoner was talking about the mare and said he wished he could sell it—Bateman asked what sort of a mare it was and said his brother wanted one—the prisoner described her to him and Bateman went to look at her—he said he was afraid it would not suit his brother but he could take it down and show it to him—I went with the prisoner to Bateman s house to show the mare—he said it would not suit him and we returned to the White Hart—next day Mr Jenkinson came and saw her and rode her—they afterwards went into the house and Mr Jenkinson bought her of him—the prisoner took the saddle away and sold

so lame she could not come out—it did not strike me that she had been hard ridden—I thought I was taken in—a man told me she had spavin—she was very poor and out of condition—I really thought it a fair price WILLIAM ATTFIELD I am an officer of Worship-street On the 23rd of February in consequence of information I went to Mr Northover s stables and found the mare and bridle which was afterwards

the same well knowing it to have been stolen against the Statute &c MR PRENDERGAST conducted the Prosecution THOMAS WARNER I am a farmer and live at Alborough hatch near Ilford Essex A mare belonging to Mr Beall was brought to me about the 22nd of November—I saw it last on the 16th of March between nine and ten o clock in the morning and directed it to be driven into Epping Forest—George Hale had charge of it on the forest—I have seen Mr Beall several times since—he has not paid me for the keep of the horse—I have not yet delivered him any bill—his servant it here—I saw the mare again on the 7th of April in custody of the police—is was the same mare that was taken away on the 16th of March—I had received it from Devonish—it had a very particular head and countenance Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q How long prior to the 16th of March was she turned out on the forest A It was turned out that morning and had been there about a fortnight but was brought home at night FRANCIS HENRY BEALL I have a bay mare which I sent to Mr Warner the first week in December or last week in November—it has a remarkable forehead and face what I call rather a sour countenance—I saw her again on the 8th of April at Brick-lane station-house—I am quite certain it was the same mare—she was in a wretched condition then—when in condition she was worth full 30l —there was a scar made on her forehead which was not there when I sent her—I think it had been produced with caustic—it had not destroyed the cuticle but had taken off the hair GEORGE HALE I am eleven years old I was in Mr Warner s employ in March last—I took the mare to Epping Forest—she had not been there above three or four hours when a man came and took her away—I told him it was not his mare but he never made me any answer—he put a halter on her and was very quick—he jumped on her back and rode her away—he had no saddle—I had no one to help me—I went home and told master—I should know the man again—I am quite sure the prisoner Enever is the man—I had seen him before—I did not know his name but I knew him by sight—I had seen him on the Forest—I saw the mare again at the station-house—I had her in my care some time Cross-examined Q You were looking after the horse A Yes it was along with our colts—there was no other horse there—I am quite certain of the prisoner—it was between three and four o clock in the afternoon —I cannot state the time nearer than that—he had on a kind of blue coat like he has on now—I saw the boy King when I went back to my master s and I told him THOMAS DEVONISH I am servant to Mr Beall I have groomed the mare for two years—I took it to Mr Warner s—I have seen her since at the station-house—there was a great deal of difference in her there but I have not the least doubt of her being master s—she was very plain and awkward about her head and had a very sour countenance—she had a very particular mark on her near hind leg in her fetlock joint—a white and black mark JOHN DOUGLAS I am a policeman About twelve o clock at night on the 18th of March I was on duty in Lamb s-gardens Bethnal-green—the prisoner Lee is a housekeeper there—I do not know what he is—a woman of the town was making a noise in front of his house and he gave charge of her—she was taken to the station-house by two other police-men—she complained of ill usage from him—he had refused to admit her and she broke his window—she said to him If you serve me out I will serve you out go and bring that stolen horse out of your stable at the back of your house —I had refused before that to take her unless he went to give charge of her—he then said he would go and press the charge at the station-house—when they proceeded a little way I left them with two others and turned back—I knocked at the door of Lee s house and Enever opened the door—I said Oh Enever I am surprised to see you here I did not expect to see you here —he said Why —I said the officers were after him a few days before I heard in a case of felony and I said What is this about the horse —he made no answer to that—I said Let us see him —he took the light off the table and opened a door at the back of the room which led into a stable—I there saw a bay mare—I asked him who it belonged to— Oh he said It is Lee s mare which his brother lent him to work with —I examined the mare particularly so that I might look over the list of stolen horses in the Hue and Cry and then went to the station-house—I overtook the woman before they got there but Lee was gone—after the woman was charged I went back again to Lee s house and knocked at the door—nobody opened it—I remained there about twenty minutes—I then went round to the back of the house where the stable is—looked through a little window in the stable and the mare was gone—I have seen her since but she was in different condition to what she was then—when I saw her in the stable she looked as if she had not been groomed for some time but I am certain it is the same one I have seen since Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you know of the prisoners being brought to the police-office A I did not—I first heard of it nine or ten days ago—I think they had then been finally committed—I did not go to the office to give evidence—Enever was called by the name of Joe—Lee gave the woman in charge for breaking his window—I did not know him living there before MR PRENDERGAST Q Who was in the house besides Lee A Two females COURT Q Why not take Enever into custody at first when you knew the police were after him A That was only hearsay MR PHILLIPS Q Do you know of any reward being offered about the horse A I heard of it about nine days ago—I gave this information before that—directly I heard they were taken Power the policeman told me they were in custody—I told him what had happened—that was before I heard of the reward—I had given information before that to different constables but not to Power—I do not know whether the prisoners were committed at that time MR PRENDERGAST Q When did you give information of what you had observed about the mare A Immediately—I informed the inspector on duty—at the time I saw Power the prisoners had been in custody some time and the horse was found—I do not expect any of the reward THOMAS CUMMING I am a policeman In consequence of information on the 4th of April I went to a chandler s shop in Weymouth-terrace Hackney-road and went from there to a stable where I found a mare—I did not Hake her away at first—I watched there and at half-past three o clock in the afternoon I heard a noise in the stable—Power and Clements went into the stable and I went in at another door—I saw the prisoner Lee there—power said You are my prisoner on suspicion of stealing this mare —he said I did not steal the mare it belongs to my master —I took the mare out of the stable and the constable took Lee—I asked who his master was—he said I don t know him he is a tall man —I asked where he lived—he said he did not know—I said it was very strange he Should have a master and not know where he lived—he said I don t Know —I took the mare to the station-house and put it into Leach s stable in Brick-lane—I and some other constables went about half-past four o clock to Lamb s-buildings and took Enever within about 200 yards from there coming down a court—I said You are my prisoner —he said What for —I said For stealing that mare you have got —he said I know no mare I have got no mare —I took him to the station-house searched him and found a small padlock-key on him—I tried it to the lock we took off the stable-door in Weymouth-street and it locked and unlocked it—when he heard us say that it did so he said it belonged to his lodging and he said I have no mare —he said Power knew how he got his living Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Was Power present at the time you had the conversation with Lee A He was—I did not hear Lee say he was in company with his master when the stable was taken for the mare—he might have said so to Power and I not hear it DENNIS POWER I am a policeman I went to the stable in Weymouth-terrace on the 4th of April with Cumming—after watching some time I saw Lee there—he was about to supply the horse with food—the account Cumming has given of the conversation with Lee is correct—I was the first that entered the stable—I told Lee he was my prisoner on suspicion of stealing the mare—he then stated that he got a pot of beer and 1s a week occasionally from his master for looking after this mare—I asked him was he in company with his master at the time he took the stable—the said he was on the first occasion—I told him not to say any thing to criminate himself—I received some information from Douglas—the reward was offered immediately after the horse was stolen—we had got the mare and the parties were committed to Newgate before I saw Douglas EDWARD CLEMENTS I am a policeman I was present with Cumming and Power at the stable in Weymouth-terrace—I have heard their evidence and agree with it—this padlock came from the stable and this key found on Enever locked and unlocked it ALEXINA FLETCHER 1 am the wife of Ephraim Fletcher and live at the corner of Weymouth-terrace The stable the horse was found in belongs to my husband—both the prisoners came to hire it on the 20th of March between twelve and one o clock—my husband was not there then—Lee asked me what the rent was—Enever told me they wanted to put a hone in which they must take in from grass—in about twenty minutes Enever came alone and asked me if my husband had come in—I said no he would be in between one and two o clock—nothing more passed—he came again between one and two o clock and made a bargain with my husband for the stable—I have often seen Enever—he was generally dressed in a jacket and sleeves—on one occasion I saw him in a blue body coat and I think boots Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q At the last meeting did he not say the horse had been out to grass and the reason he took it from grass was that the man wanted the land for arable land A Yes—I do not think I was ever asked before whether Lee asked me about the rent—I think I have said before that he did—I am certain it was Lee EPHRAIM FLETCHER The stable belongs to me—I and Enever were in the stable—he said he wished to see me to make the bargain that there should be no dispute about the rent afterwards—we came to an agreement—he was to pay 2s a week and he paid me 1s deposit—I did not see Lee myself till about Easter Monday the 27th of March—Lee fed the horse and Enever swept the stable up Cross-examined by

Thurs day night the 3rd of August I saw the prisoner Henry Wicker there and served him with a pint of ale—another man was with him Cross-examined Q Which of the prisoners did you see A This one pointing to Robert I had never seen him before—it was the one with a mark in his face Henry —I took particular notice of that—I cannot say how long he was there—I did not speak to him—I did not see him again till he I was at Lambeth-street charged with stealing my uncle s horses—I did not tell the Magistrate he had a mark in his face—this is the first time I have mentioned it—I said I knew him and positively swore to him—I pointed just now to Robert but it was a mistake—I did not give myself time to look SAMUEL NEWCOMB I live at Galleywood Common about two miles from Chelmsford I have been working about four months at Horndon—I know both the prisoners—about half-past seven o clock on the 3rd of August I saw them together in the village of Horndon going towards Chelmsford—the prisoner Henry was one and I do not know whether Robert was the other—I did not see his face only his back—it was a person about his size—I said to a young man I work with There goes a young man I know his name is Wicker —I never knew either of them by the name of Haycock Cross-examined Q Did you say How do you do Henry A No—I never spoke to him—I saw him perhaps for about five minutes—I was sitting on a bench in the shop—I saw Henry s face—they were both walking one way but Henry was looking at me and I knew him—I was about twenty feet from them—it was about half-past seven o clock JAMES HARRIS I work for Dr Johnson at Barking-side On Friday the 4th of August about a quarter past four o clock in the morning I saw the prisoner with the scar on his face Henry —there were two more with him—they came by my house—they had three horses or mares—I am not positive which—they rode broadside of one another—two of the horses had bridles on and the other a hempen halter—I do not know the other man—I could not swear to the other prisoner—I had seen Henry before passing my house on the 28th of July—the three men were going towards the Bee-hive on the road to Wanstead—I followed them about a mile and a half as I was going to work there at the turn of the road to Woodford Cross-examined Q How do you know it was the 4th of August A By the day of the month by looking at the almanack and seeing the day— I am not a scholar myself but another person looked for me—it was Friday morning and if I am wrong trace back—I know Henry by the mark in his cheek and from having seen him on the 28th of July as I was sitting smoking a pipe at my door—I saw him come along with two horses—one was a mare but I am not positive whether the other was—it was at my own door just as the clock struck five o clock in the morning—I am sure that was on the 28th of July—I cannot speak to either of the other persons—I did not notice the horses on the 4th of August to describe them—I did not see any saddle on them but possibly there might be saddles—I was working in my garden—Henry was the nearest to me—it was a nice light morning GEORGE SAGGERS I am a labourer and live at Barking-side On Friday morning the 4th of August I was up before five o clock and saw the two prisoners—I am positive of them both—there was another person with them and three horses—two were brown—one was a redder brown than the other and the third a bright bay—the light brown one had a mark on the left side of the back—two had bridles and the light-brown one a hempen halter—I have seen that horse since at the Red Lion Whitechapel in Avis s possession and sworn to it—I was on the road-side—they passed me on the road going from Ilford towards Woodford-bridge Cross-examined Q Had you ever seen them before A Not to my knowledge—I met them—I was going one way and they the other—I made a stop when I saw them coming—I work for Mr Griffin a farmer at Barking—I have had no conversation with Harris about this case—the mark was on the left side of the horse about the middle of her back just where a saddle would go or a person would ride MR CLARKSON Q Did you find the same mark on the horse Avis showed you A Yes—I swear it was the same horse GEORGE AVIS I am an officer of Marlborough-street In consequence of information on Tuesday evening the 8th of August I went to a stable at the Star St John s Wood and there received a horse which had been described in the Hue and Cry—I found a large blister or burn on the near side which corresponded with the description—it was not such a mark as a saddle would make—I went down to Horndon-on-the-hill with it on the Wednesday morning and showed it to the prosecutor who identified it at once and the horse also stopped at his master s yard gate—I went to the same stable next morning and received a mare which the prosecutor s brother identified—the two horses were shown by me to Saggers and he pointed out the one with a scar on it Cross-examined Q You have nobody here to prove how the horses got to St John s Wood A No SAMUEL PRENDERGAST I am an officer of Lambeth-street I took the prisoners into custody on Saturday the 5th of August in company with Taylor at the Horns Whitechapel—I asked them their names—they both said Haycock—I asked what part of the country they came from—they made no reply—I asked what labour they had been doing and at last asked them if their names were not Wicker which they denied—I then said I had a charge against them on suspicion of horse stealing and took them into custody—in Henry s pocket I found a curb chain a pair of scissors and the thong of a whip—Taylor searched the other SAMUEL TAYLOR I was in company with Prendergast—I searched Robert and found a pair of spurs a pocket-book a sponge two combs and some other little articles WILLIAM CURTIS I am a constable of Billericay I saw the prisoners after they were in custody at Lambeth-street office—Robert said he wanted to speak to me—I went into the cell to him and he said if I could do any thing for him he would tell me of twelve cases where we should get the property back and the people as well—I told him it was too late to do any thing for him—he had been charged with stealing these horses at that time—Henry was not within hearing Cross-examined Q Were you on terms of intimacy with him A Not very—I held a warrant against him and had wanted him some time—I do not know whether he knew that—I was not examined before the Magistrate—I am a farmer and builder as well as a constable—he saw me through the iron gate—I did not get him any beer or tobacco—his mother bought him some MR CLARKSON Q It was after the examination that he sent for you A Yes HENRY SHERWIN I am an officer I was in company with Avis when he brought the horse from the Star—he took the same horse to the prosecutor MR PAYNE called SARAH CORNELL I live at Stock which is three miles on the other side of Billericay and six from Chelmsford—I know Robert Wicker—his family live at Stock very little distance from me—on Friday morning the 4th of August I remember his coming home to Stock—he came to me between two and three o clock in the morning for the key of the door which his mother had left with me as she went out nursing—I put the key out of the window to him—I saw him next morning and carried him some water for his breakfast and I saw him all that day in

his bargain and wished me to do the best I could with it Witness I did not—I only trusted it to him to exercise—I have not sold it to Ford a knacker—I do not know what the person I gave it to has done—I had the prisoner taken up the same night Dawson He was out with his cab—I should have made the money up in the morning—we were like brothers together Witness We were not—I do not know what has

fowls were boiling in the pot on the fire they appeared to have the heads torn off close to the throat and the skin torn off the breast—all the feathers and flesh of the neck were off—I observed that the heads were without necks and the fowls have necks without skins—I found some baskets in the house and one of them with some fresh blood scarcely cold and some fowls feathers and a bill-hook which appeared to have been recently used to chop up some meat—I took off Shillingworth s left shoe and in Mr Johnston s presence with a pair of dividers I tried the distance from the top of the heel to the toe and the mark of the nail in the centre and have no doubt from the measure and appearance of the impression that the shoe had made it—on a table near to where Turvey was I found a sword or sabre—the floor of that room was quite wet evidently recently washed and a quantity of black pig s hair was sticking to the floor—before I went up stairs I asked Turvey where Shillingworth was—he said he did not know any thing of him—I found only one cap and no hat—on examining the parts and putting them together I consider there is the whole carcase of a pig except the head and feet—I observed some red marks about Shilling worth s browsers as if he had been wiping his Angers—I considered that to be blood but he said before the Magistrate it was paint—it was evidently the marks of three fingers Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did you take Turvey s shoe to compare the marks A No WILLIAM PIGRUM I am beadle of Hampton Wick Hamlet On Sunday the 12th Mr Cook produced a cap to me—I know Shillingworth wore such a cap as that—I have known him many years—I do not know anybody else in the neighbourhood who wears such a cap—I went with Cook to Turvey s house—I have heard Cook s evidence—it is correct—Turvey has always lived there and his father before him WILLIAM MARSHALL I keep the Swan at Hampton Wick On Saturday the 11th I saw both the prisoners at my house—they left about nine o clock and returned in half an hour—one left about half-past ten and the other about five minutes before eleven o clock—they were drinking together—they came again on Sunday morning about twenty minutes after seven o clock and I believe a man named Fendall with them—they stopped ten or fifteen minutes Cross-examined Q There was nothing remarkable about them A Not at all—Turvey was in the habit of coming to my house which is about a quarter of a mile from Johnston s and about twenty-five yards from Turvey s MARY ATKINS My husband keeps a beer shop in Hampton Wick On Saturday night between ten and eleven o clock on the 11th of November I saw the prisoners at my house—they come there sometimes—I lad a watch in my bosom at the time— looking at the cap —I have seen Shillingworth wear a cap of this kind but I cannot swear this is the cap TURVEY*— GUILTY Aged 20 SHILLINGWORTH*— GUILTY Aged 22 Transported for Ten Years

intent to steal the carcase MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution HENRY BENTLEY I am a policeman stationed at Staines On Saturday evening the 16th of February in consequence of information from Spelling s I paid particular attention to the flock of Mr Goring in the Lammas-field—I went out about half-past ten o clock that night with Lee—Taylor our inspector had given directions to Mr Goring to have his sheep counted—about eleven o clock that night I saw Giblett go into the White Lion which is a quarter of a mile from Church-street and saw him come out about ten minutes after eleven o clock with Frake Duffin and three others—Frake and Duffin saw me and began to whisper together—they afterwards parted and Frake called out to somebody Half-past eight in the morning —they made answer It s all right and parted—Frake crossed the road towards me in the town—Giblett kept on the other side of the way and went up the town the same way as I did—Duffin went quite the contrary way—I watched Frake up the town—he went down Tilley s-lane leading to where he lives—that is in a direction from London to Staines leading towards Church-street and so to Colebrook-lane—I walked about the end of Tilley s-lane and waited there a few minutes expecting he would come up again—he came up and by that time Duffin had got up and met him at the top of the lane—they went on I followed them along to the end of Church-street to High-street that is in a straight line to Lammas-field and about a quarter of a mile from it—I met Taylor and told him what I had seen—I and Lee went the back way to the Lammas ground and waited there for Taylor—we found out where the sheep were in the field and watched them until a quarter past one o clock—they were at that time in an undisturbed state—at a quarter past one o clock we came away and Lee went home—I went up the town with Taylor and remained in the town a little time to see that ell was quiet—about two o clock we went back again and found the sheep as we had left them all quiet and in the same place—we returned again to the town went back about half-past three o clock and then found that the sheep had been driven a considerable way from where they had been across the road into another field—it is an open common there—we searched round the field but could see nobody—we then went towards Giblett s house at the corner of Black Boy-lane which comes into Clarence-street and Church-street—I waited about by Giblett s house till about twilight and at ten minutes after six o clock I saw Frake and Giblett coming together up Church-street as if from the Lammas-field—Taylor was with me—we observed that Giblett had something under his coat under his right arm—when he saw us he seemed to try to avoid us by going across the lane—the moment they saw us they moved off and tried to avoid us—when Giblett came to where he should turn to go to his own house he went quite in a contrary direction along the Laleham-road and Frake went down the town towards his own house—I went down the Laleham-road after Giblett—I lost sight of him for a second in consequence of a projection in the road by a school—I followed and when I got sight of him again I found he was further a-head of me than before he must have quickened his pace—I came up with him about a quarter of a mile down the lane—he had passed by the school-house and by the orchard—I called Giblett after him—he said Hollo —I said Where are you going to —he said To get turnip-greens —I said Do you stop out all night to get turnip-greens —he said No —I said You have been out all night —he said he had not—I said What were you doing in Church-street with Frake —he said he had not seen Frake—I then asked him what that was he had under his arm—he said Nothing —I said You had something —he said You may search me if you like —I felt down his coat and could not find any thing—I asked him if he had got a knife—he said No —I said What were you doing with Frake in Church-street —he said he had not seen Frake—I said I am sure I saw you come down Church-street —he said You night see me but I have not seen Frake I came down on the moor to get turnip-greens —I said Turnip-greens don t grow on the moor —I told him to come up into the town with me which he did—he held his hands down by the side of his coat—I said What is the matter with your hands —he said Nothing —I said Let me look —he put up his right-hand and it was all over blood back and front the inside and round the outside of the finger nails—the blood was quite damp as if it had been fresh and between the fingers also—I asked him to show me the other hand that was all over blood also but not so bad—I asked how he accounted for it—he said he had been dressing a sheep s head over night—I asked him where he bought the sheep s head —he said he did not know for his wife always went to market—I then told him I strongly suspected he had stolen one of Mr Goring s sheep and I should lock him up till I ascertained it which I did—this was about ten minutes after six o clock in the morning between the lights—I afterwards went with Taylor to Giblett s house—I did not see Giblett s wife—I found no sheep s head there—Taylor and I then went to Frake s—we found him at home with his shoes off—I observed blood on his hands which appeared fresh—it was noticed to him and he laughed at it—we took him into custody and gave information to Mr Goring—I was present about seven o clock that morning when a sheep-skin the feet and part of the entrails was found in the Thames which joins the Lammas-field—they had been tied together with string and thrown in—a sheep s head was left with me by a young man named Denyer—I took it to Mr Goring s about ten o clock that morning and saw it compared with the skin which was taken out of the Thames—the lip of the sheep where there had been no wool had been starred down—part of the flesh remained on the lip and part on the skin Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Where is the Lammas-field A At the back of Staines church—I did not search for a sheep s head or any thing at Giblett s—I have been at Staines sixteen months—Giblett has been there all that time—I asked him all these questions before I told him I took him into custody MR CLARKSON Q Why did you not look for the sheep s head at his house A Because we knew he had not been home—he had gone on by his house and could not have got in without my seeing him ROBERT TAYLOR I am Inspector of the police of Staines About a month before the loss of Mr Goring s sheep I received information from Spellings and on the Thursday before this I received further information from him in consequence of which I and my men were on the look-out about the Lammas-field—my attention was culled to the two prisoners and Duffin about a quarter-past eleven o clock on Saturday night going down Church-street—I knew their persons perfectly—I first saw Frake and Duffin coming down the town in company together when I was going up Church-street—it would lead them to the Lammas-field—in consequence of information I placed Lee and Bentley at the Lammas the back way and I went down Church-street to see which way Duffin and Frake went—I lost sight of them in consequence of having some conversation with a man—I joined Lee and Bentley again in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at the Lammas—we remained there till a quarter or half-past twelve o clock—I then sent Lee home and Bentley and I left for a short time and went down the town—we went from the town to the Lammas at different times and at three or four o clock in the morning found the sheep disturbed and looked about to find who was concerned—about ten minutes after six o clock I was standing opposite the turning going down Church-street and heard some body coming up Church-street—it was not quite light—Bentley was with me—I went towards the place and observed Giblett and Frake—I have not the least doubt of them—they were coming in a direction from the Lammas—we were standing opposite the turning which leads down to Giblett s house—the prisoners separated very abruptly—Giblett went away from his own house down the Laleham-road and Frake went towards his own house—I directed Bentley to go after Giblett while I went to Frake—I asked him where he had been all night—he said In the field —I said What field and what did you do there —he said he had been sleeping in a field at the back of Murrell s-mill—that is about two or three hundred yards from his own house——I told him I had been watching for him and considered he had been out thieving all night—he said Well you know very well where to find me if you should want me —it was a bitter cold night and frosty—I saw him go down towards his own house—I then went down the Laleham-road after Bentley and Giblett—I afterwards saw Giblett s hands examined—they were bloody and appeared damp in some parts particularly between the two fingers— when I saw him in Church-street he had something under the arm of his coat —I heard him say he had been dressing a sheep s head overnight for his supper—he said he went out at four o clock and had not been out at night—the police sometimes go off duty about four or half-past four o clock in the morning—people who an watching us would know that—he said he had been out on the moor to get turnip-greens—there are none there it is a large common—he was locked up—I then went to Frake s—I examined his hands and there was blood on them—I said Why Frake your hands are bloody —he said Are they or words to that effect—the blood appeared in the same state as Giblett s as to freshness but not in quantity—I locked him up and caused information to be given to Mr Goring—about eleven o clock the sheep were brought from the Lammas—he described directly that be had lost a bell-wether sheep—I was present when the skin was found in the Thames—I saw the place where the sheep had been killed—it was in the field adjoining the Lammas-field—both fields bound the Thames—I saw the head compared with the skin and there is no doubt the skin had belonged to that head—I afterwards saw the carcase and saw the joint compared with the bead where they had been parted—I have not the slightest doubt the head belonged to that sheep Cross-examined Q Did you make any memorandum of the questions you put and the answers you got A No the field in which the sheep was killed I think bounds the county—it is in Buckinghamshire—the Lammas is in Middlesex THOMAS GORING I am a butcher at Staines On Saturday night the 16th of February my father had sixty-four sheep in the Lammas-field—I had been cautioned by the officers to count than—on Sunday morning in consequence of information they were counted again and there was one missing which had a bell round its neck—I afterwards saw a skin found in the river—on examining it I found on it the marks by which we distinguish our sheep—I afterwards saw that compared with a head produced by Brown a cowboy—in my judgment the head had been taken from that skin—the Lammas-field is in Middlesex—there is a ditch separating the two fields which it the division in Middlesex—it is called Shear Ditch—I afterwards found the carcase buried in a duns heap about five hundred yards off the county—I compared it with the skin and fitted the head on—I have not a doubt that it all corresponded—the sheep belonged to my father John Goring—there it a deep bank to the ditch between the Lammas-field and the next field—it is impossible to get over it but there is a gate which is not kept locked—there would be no difficulty in getting the sheep through or over that and taking it into the field where the carcase was found—we traced the sheep by the wool all along to the gate—sheep are in the habit of remaining in the same place all night—I have no interest in the business Cross-examined Q Did you discover any signs of a sheep having been killed A Yes about two hundred and fifty yards from the Lammas and we found the bell of the sheep close by it—it was not cut up—it was stuck in the neck and the skin was taken off very badly not like a butcher would do it JOSIPH BROWN I am a cow-boy to Mr Holgate—his orchard is on the Laleham-road—there is a little school-room built by the road side with a paling about five feet high On Sunday morning the 17th of February between eight and nine o clock I was going to milk master s cows—I went into the orchard near the school-room as the cows were there and found a sheep s head about a yard from the paling—a man might have pitched it over as he passed by—Mr Denyer was coming along and asked me to give it to him which I did Cross-examined Q You did not see it come over A No RICHARD DENYER I am a collar-maker and live at Staines I saw Brown with the sheep s head in his hand—I took it from him and took it to Mr Goring—I afterwards gave it to Lee the police-sergeant at half-past nine o clock—I saw Mr Goring compare it with the skin and the carcase and it fitted ROBERT SPILLINGS JUN I was a drayman in the service of Messrs Ashby the brewers at Staines One Sunday morning about a month before Mr Goring s sheep was lost I was in the White lion public-house at Staines and saw the prisoners there—Frake asked me if I wanted any thing for dinner—I said Yes and asked him what he had got—he said a leg of mutton—I communicated the conversation we had to Taylor and told him what I had purchased of them—I saw them again in the evening—on the Thursday before the Saturday when this sheep was taken I saw Frake at the White Lion—he asked me to give him some beer—I gave him some—he said We will make it all right by Sunday if we have a pull before then —I asked what they were going to have and said A woolly one —he said Yes —I said One of Mr Goring s —he said Yes —I asked him when he was going to have it—he said If we don t to-morrow night we shall on Saturday night —I went and told Lee the policeman what had passed—Frake told me to be at the White Lion on Sunday morning by half-past eight o clock to receive a leg of them—on the Friday evening I was coming home with the dray through the town and met Frake coming up Church-street from the Lammas where the sheep were—he said he had been and looked out a good one—I went after the police to tell them but they were out on duty and I told the watchman—I had regularly told them what passed from time to time—Frake had told me on Thursday night what time the police came off duty—he said We can always beat them we know what time they come off duty between four and five o clock in the morning —on Saturday evening as I was going home from the White Lion about a quarter before eleven o clock I met Giblett—he asked me if I had seen Frake any where—I said yes I had and I had been hunting after him—I told him Frake was at the White Lion—he said I hope he ayn t gone down the field for the policemen are gone that way and if he does not mind what he is at they will nick him —I was in the tap-room of the White Lion on Saturday night and so was Frake but I was gone home before they parted—I did not hear any thing said about It s all right Cross-examined Q Did you go and tell the Magistrate of this A No this is the first time I have given evidence on oath—I am a native of Staines—I had been in the public-house about four hours on the Saturday night—I left at a quarter to eleven o clock—I was not drinking all the while Frake Q You say you saw Giblett and me there on Friday night A No on the Sunday morning after Simmons s sheep was lost not Mr Going s—I said If you would go down in the country with me you could go on the Monday and bring things back—I did that to keep in with you and to know when you were going to do the deed—I never told you so but once—I have not been offered 5l to come here—I never told any body so or any thing of the sort MR CLARKSON Q Were you ever charged with any offence before a Magistrate in your life Q No—I have lived with Messrs Ashby six years Frake to HENRY BENTLEY Q How could you see me and Giblett coming up Church-street when you stood against a large building which prevented your seeing us A I could see to the end of Church-street and I heard you coming before I saw you—I was not twenty yards from you Frake s Defence I am innocent of the charge—I came out of this house on Saturday night and went up the town—I came along with this Thomas Duffin—he was at the top of the town—he went as far as the top of Church-street and wished me good night—I wished him good night and went and laid down—I never saw Giblett till next morning at the Cage FRAKE— GUILTY Aged 23 GIBLETT— GUILTY Aged 40 Transported for Fifteen Years Before Lord Chief Justice Tindal 
t18390408-1186  1186 THOMAS GODLIMAN was indicted for stealing on the 5th of March at Harefield 1 wether sheep price 2l 6s the property of Stephen Morgan MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution JOHN WILLIS I am bailiff to Mr Morgan of Harefield Middlesex near Uxbridge the parish of Rickmansworth joins the parish of Harefield On the night of the 16th of March master had thirteen sheep in a field called Woodcock s Field—I went there at eight o clock on Sunday morning the 17th and there were but twelve—a fat wether sheep was gone—I found the skin and entrails in the adjoining field—I observed foot-marks in that field of more than one man—it is a meadow—the field the sheep had been pasturing in was a turnip-field—I observed foot-marks in that field also of one or two persons corresponding with those in the field where the sheep was slaughtered—one of them was very remarkable—I sent for the constable and we followed the track of the footsteps for about a mile towards West Hyde in Rickmansworth parish—the nearest foot-mark to the prisoner s house was about half a mile—it led to many other houses besides his—on the following morning Monday I went to the prisoner s house about half-past eleven o clock and while the constables were searching it the prisoner came home—he said Halloo what is the matter now —the constable said We are looking for mutton —he said I wish there was some here —the other constable said Let me look at your shoes —he held up one—the constable said Let me look at the other —he then held up the other—the constable said They are the shoes —I noticed the tips had been taken off the heels—it appeared to have been done not more than an hour or two I could see by the appearance of them—the shoes were taken from him and he was taken into custody—I observed in the gap between the two fields impressions of a person wearing corduroy breeches having knelt—there was the appearance of two persons having been there—in getting up the bank they had made a slip and knelt down on their left knee—there was the mark of cord and at the bottom a flat impression as if the breeches had been mended with cloth—I saw the prisoner s trowsers afterwards they were corduroy and were mended with a piece of cloth—in my judgment those trowsers made that impression—it was a very strong impression—the bank was dirty and his trowsers were soiled with dirt JOHN ATKINS I am a constable of Harefield On Sunday morning the 17th of March I was sent for and went to Woodcock s-field—I found foot-marks in the sheep-fold of one man very remarkable indeed—I noticed the mark of a toe of a shoe and the knee of trowsers where he had slipped on the gap between the two fields—there were marks of two persons having been there—in the adjoining field we found the skin and entrails of the sheep—I accompanied Willis in the direction the foot-marks led and went to West Hyde—I traced those marks nearly down to the prisoner s house—there were one hundred or two hundred impressions of foot-marks very strong in some places—I found some about a quarter of a mile from the prisoner s house—I went to his house on the Monday and found about three pounds weight of mutton cooked and a great deal of broth but none raw—he came in and said Halloo what are you at there —I said Searching for stolen mutton —I asked him to let me look at his shoes which he did—I said That is one of the shoes let me see the other —he held it up—I said I could swear that was the shoe that made the track—they struck me directly as being the shoes and seeing the tips were fresh pulled off I asked him why he had pulled them off—he said they had been off about a week—I told him to pull the shoes off and I put them into my pocket—I examined the foot-marks with the shoes and they exactly corresponded—before that in consequence of information I went to Ford s a shoe-maker s near the prisoner s house—he produced two tips to me in two parts—I put them together and they formed a pair of tips—I applied them to the prisoner s shoes and they were the tips that had come off these shoes—I applied the shoes to the foot-marks and they exactly corresponded—I can safely say the impressions from the fold to within a quarter of a mile of the prisoner s house had been made with those shoes—after I took him into custody I saw him throw something away—I ran and picked it up and found it was this knife—I opened it and there were marks of blood on it and a sort of fat—the prisoner is a labourer—I asked him where he got the meat he could not tell me DANIEL FORD I am a shoemaker and live at West Hyde Rickmans-worth about a hundred yards from the prisoner s On Monday morning the 18th of March he came to my house about twelve o clock—he did not say any thing but took the pincers off the bench went behind me and did something to his shoes—what it was I do not know as I was busy at work but I heard something rattle against the grate—after hearing he was taken into custody I had the curiosity to see what I had heard rattle and I took up two tips—after a little while Atkins came and asked me for the tips the prisoner had taken off his shoes—I said What tips I have not teen him take any thing off but after hearing you had taken him into custody I had the curiosity to look and I picked up these tips —he fitted them to the shoes and they apparently fitted ELIZA FORD I am the daughter of the last witness I was at home on Monday morning—I saw the prisoner come into the house and take the pincers off the bench go behind my father take the tips off and throw them under the grate JOHN ATKINS re-examined I took him about twelve o clock—I had not seen him come out of Ford s—I traced the steps on the Sunday morning—I did not go nearer than a quarter of a mile from the prisoner s house as I did not want it to be known that I was tracing Prisoner My father knows I was at home and in bed and if he had known what time my trial would come on he would have been here Witness The prisoner lives with his father—I found the track of one person s shoes in the fold—they corresponded with the prisoner s shoes—I could only plainly distinguish one person s foot-marks at the gap and they were the same as those in the field—the prisoner s father showed me his own shoes—he has a much larger foot than the prisoner—nothing was said about where he was on Saturday night

stealing therein 7 tame fowls value 14s his property MR PRENDERGAST conducted the Prosecution BARRINGER HUNT I live at Harlington I had eighteen hens and two cocks which I saw safe at seven o clock last Sunday night at roost in a hen-house in the yard in which my house stands—it was locked up—next morning at six o clock I found the lock broken off and hung on again and the door broken open—I found six hens and a little bantam-cock gone—after getting over the wall of my yard I observed some feathers and there was a short ladder against the wall—I observed a track of feathers near the ladder which led over the wall into an orchard across a meadow and there were several feathers dropped through a wheat-field across the turnpike road into a pea-field near the prisoner s house—we saw no feathers in the pea-field—we traced footsteps nearly half a mile—the track ended about a quarter of a mile from the prisoner s house—it is loose ground and I did not try to trace further than out of the wheat-field—I field—I got a constable afterwards and searched the prisoner s house—the constable called me into the house after he had gone in and produced a bag of feathers from behind a box up stairs in the bed-room and there was a dark lantern on a shelf—I also found some feathers down stairs under the grate and some in the garden under some rubbish and straw—they were like the feathers of my fowls—two of my fowls had dark blue ends to their feathers one was a white one and one very dark all speckled and the little bantam cock was red—I observed feathers of all these descriptions in the bag behind the box—the feathers were fresh for there was quite fresh flesh on them—the prisoner had no fowls of his own—I was present when the constable compared some shoes with some marks in my hen-house and they fitted—Bray laid hold of the shoe and put it in—the mark was an inch deep in the dung—he looked at the sole of the shoe before he put it down—the bantam-cock was all red with a double cone—I found feathers of the colours of all my fowls Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How is the place connected with your house A A high wall goes half round the yard and the rest is paling—my house is in the parish of Harlington—the constable put the shoe into the mark MR PRENDERGAST Q Did you observe before he pat the shoe in whether the impression corresponded A Yes THOMAS BRAY I am a policeman I went to execute a search-warrant last Monday at the prisoner s house—I found some feathers in a bag behind a box up stairs and a lantern stood over it—there were some feathers in the front garden but I found no part of any fowls—I apprehended the prisoner about seven o clock—I took his shoes off next morning before the Magistrate and compared them with marks in the hen-house—they exactly corresponded—the marks were in the hen dirt under the roost—I could see the impressions of the nails—I did not count the nails—the impressions corresponded exactly—I traced feathers into a corn-field and into a pea-field and in the pea-field the track of the feet corresponded exactly—there were some smaller nails near one edge of the shoes and that corresponded—the prisoner has the shoes on now as he had no others to wear— the prisoner here produced his shoes from his feet —these are the shoes and these are the nails I marked but the tip has been taken off since—they both had tips one heel was full with leather and the other was not and I could observe that in the impressions—the pea-field had just been newly hoed and is within one field of the prisoner s house—I compared the marks before I put the shoe on them Cross-examined Q How far were the tracks in the pea-field from the prisoner s house a quarter of a mile A It might be BENJAMIN DRINKWATER I am a constable I was present when these shoes were compared with the marks—I am also a shoemaker—I observed marks in the hen-house which fitted the shoes—the impression was a full one—there were large hob-nails in them—there is nothing unusual in the manner the shoes are nailed—some shoes are made differently to others—they corresponded in size—I compared them in several parts of the track and should say those marks were made by these shoes BARRINGER HUNT re-examined Looking at the bag of feathers Here are feathers exactly corresponding with the feathers of my fowls—here are some red belonging to the bantam-cock and some blue with a white speck—here are some I picked up under the grate—I am satisfied to the best of my belief that these are the feathers of my fowls Cross-examined Q You are quite certain these two feathers are feathers of your bantam A Yes—I think positively these are the feathers which came off the fowls I lost—I do not know that the prisoner s wife is in the habit of

communication from Mr Haddon—on the 25th of August I went down to Ickworth in Suffolk and saw ray horse—I knew it directly—it was in a very poor state indeed and had its tail cut square—when I lost it it was in very excellent condition and had a switch tail—I attended before the Magistrate and after I swore to it they allowed me to take possession of it—a man named Manning is now in Bury Gaol charged with receiving it—Cousins saw my horse on my road back at the Windsor Castle public-house Purley Green and Johnson Mr Batty s carman has also seen it—I found the horse s neck very sore as if

Woolwich—I told him I did not know—he asked me the way to Shooter s-hill—I said I did not know—I went in to clean my knives and after that I saw him going into the stable—I went to him and saw a dark bay horse there—the prisoner had a pair of plated spurs on and was looking at the horse eating his corn—the horse seemed as if he had been hard ridden and did not appear to eat his corn—I saw the prisoner put a Mackintosh on the horse after I had rubbed him down—it was heated very much as if it had been ridden a good bit—the prisoner said I think I have ridden him rather too hard T have driven him off his stomach —he left the Mackintosh behind and I produce it—I went to get some water to give the horse and the prisoner said Stop a bit I will get a pint of ale to pat into it as it may do him good which I did and the horse drank part of it—he then said he would shut him up a few minutes—he pot the Mackintosh on him and went away and left him for a little while—I went and finished my knives and afterwards I came out again to see how the horse got on—the prisoner then said he thought he should start and wanted his horse—I put the saddle and bridle on—it was a new bridle—I got the horse ready for him and he rode away—I have not the least doubt of the prisoner being the man—I have since seen the hone in the prosecutor s possession and have not the least doubt of its being the same Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q When did you first see the prisoner again A When I saw him at Union-hall—he was sitting where the police were—Mr Cordy said Look round and see if you can see the man —I looked round and Mr Cordy said Do you see him —I said The man sits on the other side there behind those people —Mr Cordy did not say That is Chapman —he asked me if the man sitting in the bar was the man and I said it was—he pointed to Chapman and asked if he was the man and I said he was—I was gone down to Mr Gosling s to get some hog-wash when the prisoner came to our stable—when I came back I saw him come out of the back-yard—there was nobody with him—there were more people in doors—I do not know Richard Staines—I know Richard who looks after the van horses— Richard Staines was called in —that is the man—I knew his Christian name but not his surname—he was at my master s that day—I saw him just after I turned from getting the hog-wash—he sometimes assists in taking care of the horses

his finger MR CLARKSON Q What was the first thing he said A When we went in Mr Cordy said Look round this room and see if you can see the man —I did so and saw the man—I had not seen him before Mr Cordy asked if that was the man sitting round there behind I said it was—the prisoner is a very tall man about five feet five—I have not the least doubt he is the man COURT Q What day was it you saw the prisoner at Union-hall A About three weeks ago I think—it was before I signed my deposition—I went there twice GEORGE PETERS I am groom to Mr Goddard of Portslay About eleven o clock on the morning of the 11th of July I was going on my master s business to Copperas Gap which is about half a mile from Mr Cordy s premises and saw the prisoner about one hundred yards from Mr Cordy s house going towards it—I am certain of him—there was another man with him shorter than the prisoner—I think I should know that man again if I saw him—it was not young Manning—I had never seen 1/4 the prisoner before to my knowledge—I did not see him again till he was at Union-hall—I knew him there directly he came up Cross-examined Q How long was that after you saw him at Copperas Gap A About eight weeks as near as I can tell—I did not hear the Magistrate when he heard it was a question of identity order all the wit-nesses out of the office—I was sitting alongside Mr Cordy s servant Hards—directly he came up I said to Mr Cordy s servant That is the man I saw at Portslay don t you know him —the servant said I don t know I believe that is him —Mr Cordy s servant was not with me

saw at Portslay and said Is that Chapman —he said I think it is —I said Js that the man but I meant was that Chapman Q Before you were sworn at Union-hall did not two persons point out Chapman in the dock as being the man A No—as he came up I said I knew him—nobody pointed him out as being the man before I was sworn— that I swear positively—I was there when Chapman was brought up—I did not hear the Magistrate order the witnesses out—I did not see the witnesses go out—I saw the woman go out—I do not know who ordered her out—she gave evidence—I never said to that gentleman Mr Woolf that I had heard two persons behind me say that Chapman was the man—I think that gentleman asked me some question on the part of the prisoner but I did not say so in answer to his questions—the prisoner did not speak to me when I saw him at Portslay but the man who was with him stopped and spoke to me for about a minute I suppose CATHERINE HENTLEY I keep French s Gate at Red Hill in the direct road between London and Brighton and about ten miles from Croydon I heard of the loss of Mr Cordy s horse—before that between six and seven o clock in the morning I think a person came through the gate with a horse—he was coming up gently walking and the horse appeared in a terrible distressed state and much fatigued but seemed to have got cooler—when he got to the gate it appeared to have been ridden hard—I think it was about seven o clock—I cannot recollect what morning it was—my nephew let the horse through the gate—I did not look at the man so much at the horse—I cannot say the prisoner is the man for I stood in a doorway md the porch is low—I did not see him much as he sat on the horse—I think he was a tall man and he had a Mackintosh on like the one produced—I thought it was an old Mackintosh Cross-examined Q Were you taken to Union-hall to be examined A Yes—I saw all the other witnesses there—I do not remember being lent out of Court JOSEPH JOHNSON I am carman to Mr Batty a

prisoner—I do not know where he is—I bad seen him two or three times before in company with my father and the prisoner—he is not at all like the prisoner—after Smith put the bone into my father s cart my father and the prisoner went away together with the horse and cart—I cannot say how long they staid away for I was Dot at home when they returned—I came home about five o clock that evening and found the horse there—the prisoner was not there—my father gave me some directions in consequence of which I took the horse to Mr Batty s I fetched it away again just eight days after and took it by my father s directions over the water to him—that was the last I saw of the horse—what became of it or my father afterwards I do not know—my father is now in prison in Suffolk on this charge—on the Tuesday after I bought the horse from Mr Batty s I drank with the prisoner at a public-house near the Court of Requests and he said the horse that my father had gone into the country with belonged to him—on the day the prisoner and Smith brought the horse my father was outside the door about half-as-honor before they came walking backwards and forwards feeding his own horse Cross-examined Q What were you charged with A I do not now—I never asked what I was sent to gaol for—Mr Cordy said he must take me into custody—I did not ask him what for—he said to had got evidence enough as he thought to take me into custody—I thought it was taking a great liberty with me and did not much like it—I had never been taken up before—I was ill at the time and was very much hurt about it—I did not ask whether it was for highway robbery horse-stealing or house-breaking—I had heard that my father was taken into custody at Bury for having a horse in his possession knowing it to be stolen and I thought I was taken up on the same case—I had not the horse in my possession—I might have known Smith about six weeks—he is shorter and stouter than the prisoner—I did not notice his whiskers—they may be largish whiskers—the prisoner does not look the same as I have always seen him—he is altered in his face—he looks much thinner and his whiskers may not be so bushy as they were—I can not say that I see any other difference—I cannot tell what kind of whiskers Smith has—I was never in his company more than an hour at a time and I never took notice of his whiskers—I cannot tell how many times have been in his company—I cannot form any recollection—I might have seen him half a dozen times or more—I cannot positively say—I will swear I have not seen him twenty times—I drank with him twice that is all—one time I was an hour in his company and the other time about quarter of an hour but I cannot tell whether he has large whiskers or not—I was examined at Union-hall—I was not sworn as I was not examined as a witness against the prisoner—I was examined—I am sure I was not sworn—I think what I said was taken down by the clerk—it was read over to me and the prisoner last Thursday—I signed it no the Friday—I was not desired to listen to it—I was there as a prisoner—my father is a short stout elderly man—his whiskers are turning grey—they are not large—the last time I saw Smith was on the Saturday before I was taken—I cannot say how long my father and Smith have been acquainted—I have seen them together for a month or six weeks—my father been acquainted with Chapman three or four years—I have been acquainted with him about three years MR CLARKSON Q When did you last see Smith with the prisoner A On the Sunday my father went away at Chapman s house MR CORDY re-examined The

by that I advertised him Cross-examined Q Has the prisoner grown shorter or stouter since he was taken up A I see no difference in that CHARLES COUSINS re-examined I gave Mr Cordy a description of the prisoner before he was taken into custody—his whiskers now are not so long as they were when he came to Purley Green and they do not come down so far WILLIAM LEVERICK police-constable R 57 On Thursday

is a beer-shop in Page s-walk—I asked him if he knew old Manning of the Spa-road—he said he did—I asked him if he had ever lent him a horse and cart at any time to go into the country with—he said he had not—I then said young Manning had told Mr Cordy in my presence that the horse his father had gone into the country with was his Chapman s horse—be said he could not have said so for he never had a horse nor any thing to do with one—young Manning was taken about half-an-hour before Chapman and he gave me some information about the horse Cross-examined Q Were you present when young Manning was taken up A Yes—Mr Cordy told him he was sorry to say he was compelled to give him into custody on account of the horse being traced to his possession MR CLARKSON Q Are the prisoner s whiskers in the same state as when you took him A No they came pointed down to his chin nearly and were darker rather—they are not as full now as they were then MR PHILLIPS Q They look as if there had been some dye to change the colour A They are rather lighter than they were—I have known him a long time—I am certain Mr Cordy told young Manning he gate him into custody for the horse having been in his possession—I was at Unionhall—I remember the question being raised as to the identity whether the prisoner was the man and Mr Traill publicly ordered those out of Court who bad come there to identify the prisoner—Peters was there to identify the prisoner—I believe he was ordered out among the rest—I cannot say whether he went out for I did not know he was a witness—Mr Cordy bad brought him—I believe Mr Cordy was present when the order was given—Mr Traill did not rebuke Peters in my presence for remaining after the order was given—I was not in Court all the time—I was there when Peters was

taken up on the Tuesday and the prisoner about the Wednesday week following MR PHILLIPS Q Had you seen the prisoner in the interval A No MR PHILLIPS called RICHARD STAINES I am horsekeeper to Mr Stanbury My station is at the Windsor Castle public-house where Cousins is ostler—I remember a man and a horse coming to the Windsor Castle one day while Cousins was gone down to Mr Gosling s to fetch some hog-wash—the man and horse one about half-an-hour before Cousins returned—it was a bay horse it seemed to sweat very much—after Cousins came he attended to the tone himself—I attended to it before he came—the man and horse were at the Windsor Castle public-house it might be an hour and a half—I cannot say exactly—as far as my oath the prisoner is not the man for he had larger whiskers and a darker complexion—I do not think he was quite so tall and rather stouter in proportion—I do not know the prisoner at all—I saw him last Thursday—I have had no acquaintance with him—some Policeman came to the Windsor Castle soon after—Mr Vickery the landlord had an opportunity of seeing the man—I cannot say whether Mr Cordy took Mr Vickery to Union-hall—I was there and saw Mr Vockery there—I talked to the man it might be nearly half-an-hour—he was there nearly an hour and a half MR CLARKSON Q You say you do not think the man was quite so tall as the prisoner A No—I will swear he is not so tall as that man what I can see of him now but I cannot see the height of him now—I saw the height of him at Union-hall—I am quite positive the man I saw at the stable was not so tall as the prisoner—I am quite positive he is not the man who brought the horse—he is not the complexion of the man—I never told a gentle man I believed he was not but would not swear it—I do not remember a squabble at the office between two attorneys who should defend him—I did not hear another gentleman claim him as his client—I was not examined at the office—I was outside and the policeman had me in and said I was wanted—I do not know who sent for me—I had an order to come down— producing it —I believe I first saw that gentleman Mr Woolf on a Wednesday night down at the Windsor Castle public-house—I do not know who I got this order from—a man brought it to me—he brought it to me before I saw that gentleman—it was not that gentle man that came down to me—a man came to me—I did not say it was that gentleman—I never saw him at the Windsor Castle public-house—I had the paper before I saw that gentleman—I first saw him in London at a public-house not a great way from the office—I do not know the name of the street—it is about a quarter of a mile from this place—a man took me there and this gentleman came and met me there—I do not know who the man was—he came down to the Windsor Castle public-house last night and wanted me to come away last night but I could not—I did not see this gentleman till this morning—I do not know Mr Flower the attorney—the gentleman wrote down what I said in the public-house—I saw him write it—I told him I could not swear exactly whether he was the man or not till I saw him again Q On your oath did not you say to Leverick the officer at Unionhall that it was the man in the dock who had the horse and that you could swear to him from a hundred or words to that effect A No I did not—I swear that—it was not the same gentleman came down to me last night who brought me the summons—I did not see this gentleman at Union-hall on the Thursday when I attended—I did not hear him cross-examine the witnesses—I did not hear what was said—I could not her very well EDWARD PARKER WOOLF I am clerk to Mr Flower the solicitor I attended on the prisoner s behalf at Union-hall—an order was given by Mr Traill the Magistrate that all the witnesses who came to swear to the identity of the prisoner should leave the office—it was given loudly so that every body could hear it and some time was allowed for the witnesses to leave—I remember Peters being examined to the identity—Mr Traill said it was a very strange thing but it very frequently happened when witnesses were required to speak to a particular fact instead of leaving the Court they did not do so—he said it in the presence of every body there but it seemed be particularly directed to Peters—he said it just previously to Peters examination—Peters said to me in answer to a question that some person standing behind him and the prosecutor s servant had said the Prisoner was the man—that I am positive of—I never saw Staines at the Windsor Castle public-house—I never was there and never spoke to him till this morning MR CLARKSON Q What was the public-house you saw him in this morning A I do not know the sign—it is contiguous to this Court—a person appeared before the Justice representing that he came from an attorney—Mr Flower had been previously instructed to defend the prisoner —this person had obtained the prisoner s signature to some papers and I complained to the Magistrate of his having done so—the prisoner was brought out and asked who he wished to defend him and he said Mr Flower—Peters was improperly in the office after the witnesses were all ordered to withdraw—I did not notice him in the office when the Magistrate made the order—he might have been there at that time but he was certainly in the office shortly afterwards and he made no answer to Mr Traill s observation—I do not remember that Mr Traill addressed him by name at all MR PHILLIPS Q What time did the witness arrive from the country A Only this morning about ten o clock MR CLARKSON re-called WILLIAM LEVERICK The witness Staines told me at the Catherine Wheel in the Borough that the man who brought the horse was the man that was in the dock and he could swear to him from & hundred—it was just after we had been to the office and seen the prisoner—it was when the witnesses were ordered out to be examined separately—I asked him to go in and be examined but he refused—I was sent out by the Magistrate to find him and found him drunk at a public-house with two others and he would not come in George Frederick Levick formerly chief-officer of the Red Rover Isaac Dodd

WILLIAM WARING I am gardener to Mr Reynolds of Brentford and live in a nursery belonging to him at Isleworth On Friday morning the 13th of December about seven o clock I was in the road and saw a grey pony staggering about the road bleeding but being dusk I could not see where the blood came from—it staggered across the road his hind legs fell under him he then fell down and soon died—I examined it and saw it had been stuck at the bottom of the throat and to the chest I consider—that was all the marks I observed at that time—I returned to the nursery about my business and in about half an-hour I saw two men approach the horse—I was in sight of where it lay—one was a tall man in a fustian jacket—the other a shortish man wore a darkish coloured coat—I cannot say whether it was black or blue—I cannot swear to the men—I have no doubt the prisoner was one of them but would not undertake to swear it positively—they were trying to push the blood about to hide it by placing mud on the blood that was about the road—I went up to the tall man in the fustian jacket and asked if it was his horse—he said Yes —I asked how he came to stick the poor thing and go away and leave it in that manner—he said It was no use after —that was all he said—I went to the other roan who stood by the horse and asked him if any thing was the matter with the horse—they were both together and in hearing—all he said was I don t know master —I went away directly to the nursery—I came back in about two minutes and they were gone—the horse laid in the road and was fetched away in the afternoon by somebody but I never saw it after—it was a grey pony and a gelding—the last time I saw it was in the road between Isleworth and Brentford by the side of the road just at the corner of the Duke of Northumberland s wall—it was not above three or four yards from the ditch— there was only the footpath between the ditch and the horse—I did not observe any particular marks on the horse WILLIAM ELLIOTT I am a butcher and live at Sherwin Green Hampshire The prisoner lived with me between two and three years ago—I have not seen him in Hampshire for two or three years—he has been living near Brentford I understand—I had a grey pony gelding which I turned into a meadow at Hartley parish about a quarter of a mile from my place—I missed it on Friday morning the 13th of December—I had seen it myself the Tuesday night before in my yard and sent my servant into the meadow with it—I did not afterwards see it in the meadow myself—I had not authorized any body to take it away nor sell it—I saw it next at Brentford which is about thirty-seven or thirty-eight miles from Hartleys—it was dead then and lying in a stable under the care of a man named Bevan I think—Taylor a Sheriff s officer took me to see it—he is not here—I examined the horse—its inside had been taken out then—I saw a scar on the leg which I could swear to—I did not see any wound about the neck because it was opened all down the neck and belly and laid on his back and his inside was washed out—I am sure it was my pony by the wound in the leg—I had had him about a month—he had the wound on the leg when I first had it—I often observed it—it was on the off far leg at the fetlock—I have the limb here— producing it —it was an iron grey—I can swear positively it was the pony I missed from my field—I never saw it in the prisoner s presence nor ever had any conversation with him on the subject EDWARD TALBOT I am a police-constable of Brentford On Friday the 13th of December I received information and went to Isleworth parish and found a grey gelding by the side of the road—it was three or four yards from the ditch which is close to the Duke of Northumberland s wall—the road leads from Brentford to Isleworth—it was eight or ten yards from Mr Reynold s garden where Warring works—I saw a quantity of blood in the road which appeared as if mud had been scraped over it—I first saw the blood thirty or forty yards from the horse—it was dead—it had a wound in the neck apparently recently inflicted and the blood was fresh—the horse was taken to Brentford to Bevan s stable—I saw it in that stable in Bevan s presence—he was standing in the road when I got up to the horse—he is not here now—I was never present when Taylor the Sheriffs officer was at the stable with the horse nor when Elliott was there—the stable is in Catherine Wheel-yard Brentford—Bevan has only one stable there—there are other stables in the yard—the yard is a thoroughfare—Bevan s stable is on the left-hand side going from Brentford—the other end of the yard opens to the locks of the Thames—it is about a third of the way do on—he prisoner was never present there with me—the horse was opened afterwards from the throat right down through the belly and the inside taken out—I observed a mark on the leg which I should know again— looking at the leg —this is the leg of the horse I found in the road—I apprehended the prisoner the same day at Brentford—I asked him if he knew any thing of that horse which was lying by the Duke s wall at Isleworth—he said Yes I killed it —he said the horse was his own and he had a right to do as he liked with his own—I had not threatened nor promised him at all—I asked him how he came to kill the horse—he said because it was no use he could not get it any further1—he then showed me the knife he killed it with which I produce—the stain of blood is on it now WILLIAM ELLIOTT re-examined I do not know the name of the yard the stable was in—it was a sort of thoroughfare leading out of Brentfordstreet and on the left hand going from the street WILLIAM WARING re-examined When I first saw the horse staggering in the road it was going towards Isle worth that is further from town than Brentford—the horse was not going direct for London but turned back towards Isleworth—Isleworth is nearer to Hampshire than Brentford ABRAHAM NOAKES I buy and sell poultry and buy old dead horses and such things On the 13th of December the prisoner came to my house and asked if I bought such things as a dead pony—I asked where it was—he told me it laid in the Isleworth-road—I went with him to look at it and found it lying in the road four or five yards from the Duke of Northumberland s wall—it was a grey gelding—I asked what he wanted for it—it was dead—I did not notice how it had been killed for while I was looking at it they said it was killed in an indecentway and I went away—the prisoner pointed it out as the one he wanted to sell—we were about half an hour together—he said the pony was taken bad in the head and dropped and then he was obliged to kill it Prisoner I hope you will consider it is the first offence I was ever guilty of I hope you will have mercy on me GUILTY Aged 25 — Transported for Ten Years

farmer living at Kingsdown near Sittingbourne On the 14th of July I had a gelding a cart and a set of harness—when I came home about six o clock in the evening I saw the gelding put into the stable and the cart into the chaise-house—part of the harness was in the stable—next morning it was all gone—I have since received the gelding from Mr Thoroughgood at the Blue-boar public-house Aldgate and the cart and harness from Bennett in Wandsworth—the horse was shown to Roff in my presence—the value of the whole is about 38l —I do not know the prisoner Cross-examined by MR JONES Q How far do you live from London A About forty-five miles on the other side of Sittingbourne between there and Feversham out of the high-road—I know the gelding by a little white on the leg and it has a rather peculiar sort of head—it is a little of the French horse more chubby JOHN ROFF I am servant at the White Howe Brixton-road I know the prisoner by sight On the 15th of July he came driving a horse and cart to the White Horse at Brixton about noon—it looked as if it had been driven a long way it was all in a sweat but was getting cool—he called for the ostler I attended to him—he told me to take the horse out and take the sweat off—I said I would put him into the stable—he said he did not wish him to be in the stable as he was going to show him to a gentleman—I began to clean him and another young man finished it—the prisoner said the horse and cart was for sale and asked what I thought it was worth—I said I could not tell him any thing about it—he said he could sell the lot he thought for about 18l —I asked why he wanted to sell it—he said his master had got two horses but had not work enough to keep two—I have since seen the horse in the presence of the prosecutor—it is the same horse—the prisoner rode it out of the yard—he asked me to take care of the harness and cart till next day till he came back—he came back next day but did not bring the horse—I asked if he had sold it—he said Partly sold it —Bennett was with him—they went into the yard and began to deal for the cart—Bennett had bought the harness for 7s 6d —they went away together with the cart Cross-examined Q How long had you lived at the White Horse A Between six and seven years—I have lived there six years without intermission—I was away eleven months five years ago—I lived at Kensington then seven months and left there and went to Croydon to live—I was all that eleven months in service and not any where else—I have never been in any sort of trouble—I was called on to identify the prisoner at Park-place Walworth about two months after he brought the horse and cart—the only time I saw him was when he brought the horse and cart and came the next day—he was about three quarters of an hour with me the first day in the yard all the time and not in the house at all—the second time he was about three or four hours there but not in my sight all the time—he was on the premises and in my sight between two and three hours—I was backwards and forwards—he had a blue coat on both times—he was dressed different at Walworth—I saw him at the station-house—there were other persons there—he had a brown greatcoat on—he was brought out and I was asked to look at him—I was asked if he was the man I said Yes at once—I did not say so the moment I saw him but five or ten minutes after at I was not asked before—I did not at first say I doubted whether he was the man nor that he was not high enough for the man nor that he was shorter than the man—I had not the least doubt of him—he was brought out and went under the standard to be measured and I stood by—as soon as I was asked if he was the man I said Yes —I never expressed the least doubt of his being the man I have not the least doubt of him THOMAS CORDWELL I am a labourer I was at Brixton on the 15th of July and remember seeing the horse and chaise-cart—the prisoner is the man who brought them—I saw him at first drive over the White Horse bridge and into the stable-yard—I assisted in cleaning the horse and helped him up on the horse when he went away on the 15th—I was present next day when he and Bennett came—the cart and harness was sold to Bennett who took them away—the prisoner went with him Cross-examined Q Had you ever seen the prisoner before A Never he was in the stable-yard the first day for about half an hour—he stood by while I cleaned the horse—I was at the station-house at Woolwich—the ostler asked me to go—I saw the prisoner as he came out into the street from the lock-up place and was asked to look at him and said He is the man —I was quite positive I never said that he was not tall enough—I did not hear Rolf say that he was not tall enough nor any thing of the kind—I am occasionally employed at the White Horse—Hayne the inspector asked me if I should know the man again at Union Hall but not since—I have not been with him a good deal lately WILLIAM SMITH I am a stableman in Cranmer-road Lambeth I went to the Swan public-house near Kennington on a Wednesday about the middle of July and saw the prisoner there with a black horse which I have since seen in the possession of Thorough good and Strouts—the prisoner told me he wanted the horse taken to St Martin s-lane to the Repository and would I take it he would give me 1s and 4d to pay the gates—I took it and delivered it to Smith the foreman of the yard Cross-examined Q Did you ever see the prisoner before A No I was not more than five minutes with him—he had a blue coat with metal buttons—I went to the station-house to identify him—the police told me to go—they brought him out of a lock-up place and asked me if I knew the man—I did not say he was not high enough—I said directly He is the man —when he came out of the cell his hat was down over his eyes very much—they turned it up and 1 had a full view of his face—I expressed no doubt of him when he was brought out—I did not ask him to put his hat higher up—the inspector turned it up and then put it down again—Roff was there and not Cord well—I did not see the prisoner put to the standard—I did not hear any body say he was not high enough for the man—the inspector told him to hold his head up when he pulled his hat up—I did not hear any body express a doubt of him WILLIAM SMITH I am servant at the Repository in St Martin s-lane I have seen a gelding in the possession of the prosecutor—I had seen it on the 15th of July—I had it from the last witness—it was sold that day—I swear it is the same gelding JAMES BENNETT I am a wheelwright and live in Wands worth-road On Thursday the 16th of July I saw the prisoner at a beer-shop near my shop waiting there for me to come home—he was dressed in a blue coat and white buttons—I have not a doubt of his being the man—I have since seen him at Union Hall and picked him out from the crowd—he bad a dirty smock-frock on then—on the 16th of July he asked me if I would buy a cart—I said I would rather sell him one—I went with him to the White Horse public-house Brixton and saw the ostler—he showed me the cart and harness there—I have since seen it in the possession of Strunts Cross-examined Q I suppose you would not buy a cart without getting a bargain A Yes I make carts and let them oat—I bought it of him for 35s —I offered to take a crown for my bargain directly—I gave 7s 6d for the harness—I do not know what it was worth—it was not fit to put on a horse it was so shabby—Strouts values his cart at 8l but I should like to make him a new one for the money—I had never seen the prisoner before—we had some beer together with the ostler and his mate—I suppose I was about three hours with him—I saw nobody with him—I have given up the cart and harness JOHN HAYNES I am an inspector of police On the 14th of September I took the prisoner into custody at the Cross Keys public-house at the foot of Blackfriars Bridge in the parish of Christ Church Surrey—Brixton is in the parish of Lambeth Cross-examined Q Do you remember Roff Cordwell and Smith coming to the station-house A Yes the superintendent sent for them—I measured the man—I told him to hold his head up—I never heard any body say he was not high enough—that I swear—we generally tell them to hold up their head when we measure them if they hold it down—I think I did tell him to hold his head up—I have very little doubt of it—Roff and Smith were present looking at him—I remember putting his hat higher on his head—none of the witnesses expressed a doubt of him—two persons came to look at him concerning another charge and they said he was not that man—I will not swear I did not tell any body to look at him again—to the best of my belief I did not say to Smith Look at him again SMUEL TOLER I am high-constable of Worthing Sussex I have a certificate which I got from the office of Mr Straight Clerk of the Arraigns for the Home Circuit—I was present at the trial as a witness—the prisoner is the person who was convicted—I have seen him four or five times since ROBERT MARSHALL STRAIGHT Esq I am Deputy Clerk of Assize for the Home Circuit the Hon Richrad Denman is the clerk I have by virtue of my office the records of the Court—this certificate was made out from the record—the records have been kept in this building for a considerable period—I know of no other place of deposit— read GUILTY

stables—I am certain it is my father s mare JAMES GEORGE SABIN I am a horse-dealer at Hounslow About half-past ten o clock on Monday morning the 30th of November I saw the two prisoners going along the road to Hounslow with a mare—they came to the Coach and Horses public-house door where I was and had a pint of beer—I went to the door and said That is just such a little nag as I should like to buy —Glew said it was for sale—I asked him the price—Hale said he was going to have it killed—it did not quite look like a dog-horse—I walked with them down to my house and had the mare taken into my yard—I asked Hale what he wanted for it where he brought it from and who it belonged to—he said he brought it from Mr William Hall s of Whiphill I think near Guildford but that he had then come from a public-house just out of Hounslow—Hale said I was to give the money and put down on a piece of paper what money I gave for the horse so that he should take it home to a relation of his—I told him I would go along with him to the public-house he said he had brought it from—Glew walked off towards London—I put the mare into the stable—and Hale went towards where he said the public-house was—when

GREEN I live at Feltham about two miles and a half from Hounslow towards Chertsey On Monday the 30th of November I saw the two prisoners going along the road in company—Glew had the nag—I did not see Hales s face—they were going towards Hounslow—I noticed that it was a chestnut mare with a white face—I have since seen Cox s mare at the Pigeons at Brentford and am certain it was the same—one of the policemen brought it from Hounslow ELIZABETH BARNES I keep a beer-shop at Feltham On the 1st of December I recollect two persons coming with a horse and having some beer—I know Glew to be one—I cannot say any thing to Hale—it was a chestnut-colour with a white face—they said they had come from Chertsey and were going to Hounslow—I went to Hounslow that morning and passed them again just as they got to the Bell—the same two men were with the horse—they came to me between seven and eight o clock and left near ten JOSEPH CHITTY I am a constable of Woking—I apprehended Hale at Cox s on the 8th of

WILLIAM BURGESS I am drover to Mr Goodman On Wednesday the 9th of December I had thirty-two wether sheep of his which I placed in Mr Puddeford s field at Southall—I went to that field on the following Sunday the 13th of December about eleven o clock—on my way I met two men named Curtis and Davis—they told me something—Davis had the skin of a down wether sheep—I knew it was the skin of one I had left in the field and I found one missing—I went to a public-house with them—Davis had the head and pluck without the heart and Curtis had the neck and breast Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What do you know the skin by A An ochre mark across the loins and a little black dot below it—I did not make that mark it was a country mark—other sheep are very seldom marked in that way—the black dot is very unusual JOHN CURTIS I am a labourer in the service of Mrs Baxter she has a field adjoining Mr Puddeford s On Sunday morning the 13th of December I found a head cut off a sheep about four feet from the body and the neck and two breasts and pluck—the neck and two breasts were wrapped up in the skin—there was no heart to the pluck—the field is called Hell-corner field—I fetched Mr Davis the bailiff and we met Burgess—Davis had the skin on his shoulder and the meat tied up in it—we showed what we had found to Burgess Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q What sheep were these A South-down wethers—this was about ten o clock in the morning GEORGE DAVIS Curtis came and showed me these parts of the sheep—I gave the neck and one of the breasts to the policeman—the skin I left with the drover—I saw a shoulder of mutton which exactly corresponded with the neck and the pith of the neck was cut in two—the meat was not set—it was cut in a very bungling manner—there is a turnip-field adjoining this field FREDERICK KEELER police-constable T 44 I was in Mr Puddeford s field on Sunday morning the 13th of December and saw some wool in the hedge and a gap cut in the hedge and some one had been through—I saw the marks of cord trowsers or breeches on the bank as if some one had been kneeling—that led to Hell-corner field belonging to Mrs Baxter and I saw foot-marks right from the hedge to the field where the sheep had been killed—there was blood and the entrails of the sheep lying there—I produce the skin of the sheep and I have the sheep s head here CHARLES STEBBINGS police-constable T 156 I went to the field and saw what the other officer saw—I saw Glasscock compare shoes to some foot-marks and I compared them with him—I do not know whose shoes they were—they corresponded with the marks in the field and going from the field WILLIAM LAWRENCE I am a police-inspector I was at Marylebone Office on the 14th of December when the prisoners were in charge—I noticed the shoes of Rowe—I observed that they exactly corresponded with the description that Stebbings gave me—there were two nails out on the inside of the right foot on the toe and two large nails in the centre and part of the tip was off—when the prisoners were about to leave the office I desired Glasscock to take their shoes off—I said that loud enough for Rowe to hear—I saw that shoe again afterwards and there had been several alterations in it—one of the large nails in the centre had been removed and the tip taken quite off Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q In what situation was Rowe when you were able to ascertain that fact A Sitting down waiting outside the office—I lifted both their legs up and looked at their shoes—Stebbings bad described the impression to me and I observed the nails in Rowe s shoes—I said to him You are the man that killed the sheep WILLIAM GLASSCOCK police-sergeant On Sunday morning the 13th of December I was in the Edgeware-road at half-past eight o clock and saw the two prisoners coming towards Oxford-street—they were coming as they would if they bad come from Southall and crossed the Harrow-road or come by the Canal—they both had bundles—I asked Arnold what he had got—he said he had got mutton—I asked where he got it—he said he had been sleeping just below pointing towards Maida-hill and he bought it from a butcher s shop just below—Davis who was with me untied Rowe s bundle and there was some fat and a shoulder of mutton and some ribs in it—I saw it was not killed in a butcher-like manner and I told Arnold I should take him to the station—he said Can t a man carry a bit of mutton through the street without being stopped by such fellows as you —I collared him and told him he must go—he resisted—I then drew my staff and said I should be obliged to use it—I called for assistance—Arnold then told me I was a fine fellow to take a man—I took him to the station—he there said his bundle contained a shoulder of mutton some fat and some pieces of ribs—he said he bought it of a man at Notting-hill and gave 7s for his lot and his mate gave the same for his—he said he did not know the man he bought it of—I found in Arnold s hat the sheep s heart and a net which would be of use in catching a sheep or a bare—I found on him a butcher s knife and another knife a stone for the purpose of sharpening them and a key—the meat did not appear to me to be set—Arnold had corderoy trowsers on—I took Rowe s shoes off after the first examination and I found several nails out which appeared to have been recently drawn and half the tip off—I compared the shoes with the marks on the ground—there was a little snow on the ground but with breathing on it it would disappear—the marks corresponded with the shoes JOHN GOODMAN I am the prosecutor These sheep were mine—I trusted them to the drover to be put in the field—I am certain this is the skin of one of my sheep—it is marked across the loins and has a dot on the hip THOMAS SBABROOK I am a butcher I have seen the parts of meat produced and the skin and pluck—they all correspond and appear to have belonged to one animal—I compared them on the morning of the 13th—the meat had not then set—it has not been cut up by a butcher Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How soon does it set A If killed in a proper way it would be eight or ten hours—I have compared the meat to-day—it fits as well as can be expected at this time—it fitted exactly at first HENRY DAVIS I am a policeman I took Rowe into custody The prisoners received good characters ARNOLD— GUILTY Aged 60

FIELD I am a farmer and live at Bayford near Hertford I had a number of ewe sheep out at pasture at Edmonton on Mr Tucker s land—I had turned them out about a fortnight before the 28th of January —I was afterwards informed that a ewe had been stolen—I saw part of the body of a sheep at the station at Edmonton and knew it to be part of one of my ewes by the marks on the skin—I also saw some wool which I believe to be mine but would not swear it—the skin was marked with dead ochre on the head the same as my sheep are marked—I am certain it was my ewe—the prisoner lives at Edmonton JOHN ROBINSON I am shepherd to Mr Field and know his sheep and their marks The policeman showed me the skin and part of a sheep which I am certain was one of my master s GEORGE TUCKER I am a farmer at

part of the carcase of another which had been slaughtered—it had its throat cut—I afterwards gave part of it to the policeman—the other sheep I should say died from natural causes JOHN SMITH I am a labourer and live in Bury-street Edmonton I was about Mr Tucker s field catching moles and found the half of a sheep with its throat cut and slaughtered—the entrails laid close by the side of the carcase—it appeared as if it had been cut clean in two all across the back—I was the first that found it JAMES HARRISON police-sergeant N 32 The prisoner and his wife were brought to the station on Friday the 29th of January—he was charged with slaughtering this sheep and it was stated to me in the presence of himself and wife that some wool and part of the mutton had been found at his house—I asked the wife if the wool belonged to her—she said it did not that her husband brought it home on the Wednesday night with the mutton—he made no reply—I went in company with Wells to Mr Tucker s field and there found some footmarks from the place where the sheep was slaughtered—the soil was moist and some of it was ploughed—the impressions were quite perfect—I compared the prisoner s shoes with those footmarks and they corresponded exactly—there was a particular nail in the prisoner s shoes which attracted my attention and it corresponded with the impressions in that and all respects—they were undoubtedly made with the prisoner s shoes JOHN WELLS police-constable N 317 In consequence of information I went to Mr Tucker s and from there to the field where I found part of the sheep slaughtered—it was cut across the back and also in the throat—I took possession of the part I found in the field—I then traced the footsteps across four or five fields within a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards of the prisoner s house—the marks were distinctly visible I saw the prisoner s shoes afterwards fixed in the marks and they exactly corresponded in every respect this was about four o clock—the prisoner was not at home then—I waited till about dusk and then went with White to the prisoner s house—I rapped at the door and heard the prisoner run up stairs—he came to the up-stairs window and asked who was there—I said it was me and asked him to come down which he did and let me in—I asked if he was aware who I was—he said Perfectly so —I said I wanted to search his house he was charged with felony—he said I might look—I took a candle and was going up stairs—he said What do you want there —I said Mr Tucker has had a sheep slaughtered in his field and you are suspected as a party concerned —he then caught hold of my back and pulled me down three or four stairs saying I should not search there—he got up first placed himself in the way and said I should not search there—I with great difficulty got the handcuffs on him—I then searched and found these pieces of wool in a basket in the cupboard and two pieces of mutton salted—I asked where he got it—he said he bought it—I asked where—he said in Shoreditch—I asked how he came by the wool—he said his wife had brought it home one or two pieces at a time—his wife afterwards came in and I asked her how she came by it—she said her husband bed brought it home with the mutton—I afterwards found this knife in the prisoner s pocket with blood and wool on it and there was blood all round bis finger nails—I heard his wife say at the station that he brought the wool and mutton home on Saturday—I afterwards searched the house again and found the prisoner s jacket which he had on that day and it was all covered with blood Prisoner He has told a falsehood I said I brought the wool home a piece at a time Witness I am sure he said his wife brought it home—I showed the mutton found at the prisoner s

Beardmore but I wrote it from overhearing a conversation between them —it is written in blood—Wilson said If it dropped from my pocket I am sure I was not aware of it I must have taken it up with my

not want any more he should go—he did not say any thing about any one else Cross-examined by—MR PREMDERGAST Q Were you at the public-house a long time with him A No about twenty minutes—I and my wife were with him—I did not go any where else with him RICHARD FORD I live at Ashford—I was at the Paul Pry public-house about twenty minutes past one o clock in the afternoon of the 11th of October—there was Leonard and a taller man in the tap-room drinking—I did not see the taller one s face—he sat against the fire with his back to me—I saw Leonard again about four in the afternoon—I was in my master s store-house—I saw Leonard come down going in the line of the Paul Pry but do not know where he went to—one man was with him but I do not know who that was Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Do you know Gower A Yes I did not see him at the Paul Pry at one o clock—I did not know Crittle before COURT Q Did you know Leonard before A No I did not see him again till I saw him at Marylebone on the

they went out and two others came in with him—I served them with two pints of mild beer—Johnson paid for it—there was a mole on Johnson s left cheek which was remarkable—I see it now—I cannot recognize either of the others—the latest time I saw Johnson there was between five and six Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Did you ever see Leonard with Johnson at all A I cannot say I did—I saw

HENRY ROCK I am a fell-monger and live at Mersham in Kent about half a mile from Mr Long s—I bad a bay mare in my stable on the night of the 11th of October—I made her up about half-past seven o clock in the evening and locked the stable-door—I had a pannel saddle in my stable which is used to carry skins in our trade—I went to the stable about four the next morning and found the door was partly shut—the lock was gone and had been prised open by an iron bar which had been taken out of a cart—the mare was gone and the saddle and the bridle—my mare was worth 15l —I would not nave taken that money for her—on the 26th of October I saw the mare again at the stable of the green-yard St Luke s in possession of the police—I have since seen my pannel saddle at Marylebone sessions-house CHARLES STANLEY I live at Kingsworth about two miles and a half from Ashford—on the morning of the 12th of October about four o clock I was in the turnpike-road which leads to Maidstone near to Ashford—a man passed me on a black horse—he asked me what it was o clock—I said I did not know whether Ashford clock had gone four or not—after that two other men came up both on one brown horse—they were coming from Bromley-green which is in the road from Ashford to Maidstone—they passed by me to come towards Ashford and from Ashford there is a road to Maidstone—I do not know whether they could have come from Mersham by that way—I saw them in the direction from Kingsworth to Ashford JOHN FILMER On the 12th of October I was toll collector at Criswill-gate which is in the parish of Thurnam on the high road between Ash-ford and Maidstone about three miles and a quarter from Maidstone About six o clock in the morning of that day two horses came through the gate—one person was on each horse—Johnson was one and Leonard was the other—one horse was black and the other was a brownish sort of a horse—Johnson was on the black horse and Leonard on the other—the black horse had a saddle on—I did not observe the other—there is a hill coming up to the turnpike—I heard them trotting the horses up the hill hard—Johnson paid me the toll for both—it was light at the time BENJAMIN COLLINS I am a tin-plate worker living in High-street Shoreditch I have a stable near my house—I am in the habit of buying horses for my business—I know all the prisoners—I was out with my horse and cart on the 12th of October—I returned between seven and eight o clock in the evening—when I got back I saw Johnson in my yard with a bay mare and a black horse—I had seen Johnson and Bull before and on that occasion bought a pony of them—they represented themselves as horse dealers—Bull said so to the best of my belief and Johnson ac-companied—him in the affirmative—on the evening of the 12th of October Johnson asked me if I could accommodate him with a stable for the two horses for that night—I told him I was afraid I could not as I had but one stall—he said that would do very well—I agreed to do so—I went with Johnson from the stable after he put them in and gave them some hay and water—in going home I met Bull in Shoreditch—I asked him how he did—he said Quite well —I had had some horses on trial—he asked if either of the hores would suit me—I told him I did not want any the one I had would suit me—I went to a public-house with Johnson and Bull—I did not see them again till I saw them at Marylebone office about a fortnight afterwards in custody—the horses remained in my stable till Friday morning—Bull said he and Johnson would be down the next morning to take the horses away—both Bull and Johnson said so but they did not come—on the evening of the Wednesday Leonard came and asked me if I had two horses left at my house or stable or left with me—I said I had—he then asked me what sort of horses they were—I told him—he said he had come from the parties who had left them and asked me if I could take care of them for two or three days—I told him No I could not accommodate him so long for two horses were in one stall and I was afraid of an accident—I then asked him why the parties had not fetched them away who left them—he told me they were gone into the country to ascertain the price for which they were to be sold as they had had a note that morning—he asked me if I could not accommodate him till the next morning—I agreed to let them stop one night more—I then saw no more of him till Friday morning when he came accompanied by Crittle to fetch the horses away—Crittle asked me if I should like to purchase one of the horses or if I knew of a buyer of such a horse as the black one—I told him I did not at present—I then referred them to a stable—he said he had bought it from his late employer in the country that it bad belonged to an old gentleman—I referred Leonard to a man named Hurst but previous to that Crittle and Leonard agreed to take them to show a person—Crittle went out and got a boy to lead them—the horses were then taken away by Leonard—Crittle was gone to a person named Page to see if he would have them—I saw both Crittle and Leonard again the same day in Smith field market—I asked Crittle if he had succeeded in selling them to Mr Page—he said he was not at home—I then saw him go and speak to Page in Smithfield—on the following day the 16th of October I saw Crittle close by my stable—he asked me if I had heard of a customer—I told him I had not—he pressed me very much to buy one and he went away—soon after I saw Leonard—he said he had not seen the parties from the country yet and would I oblige him with another truss of hay as he had not got any money and I did—on the following Thursday evening the 21st I met Crittle two doors from my shop—he asked me if I knew where Leonard was—I told him I did not—he asked me if I knew where he put up the black horse—I told him I did not—I referred him to the stable in the Curtain-road—he said if he knew where the horse was he thought he had got a customer who would buy it there and then—on the 23rd Crittle came to me while I was standing at the shop door and asked me if I could lend him a saddle as he wanted to go into the country—I told him I had not got one by me but if he called on Monday I had an old one I had lent to a person if that would be of any service to him he might have it for a few days—I saw no more of him—when Johnson brought the horses to my stable there was a saddle on each horse—to the best of my recollection one was a very large one—I do not know what a pannel saddle is—that is the one claimed by Ruck—the saddles had not been removed at the time the horses were—they were left in the loft— I delivered them to the policeman—I cannot say whether these bridles were with the horses—it was very dark Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Leonard came to you first on the Wednesday A Yes I had never seen him before—he asked me what sort of horses they were—I described them—he appeared to me to be ignorant what sort of horses they were but merely to have received information that there were two horses—and when he saw the horses he appeared not to have seen them at all before—he did not tell me that be had heard that Bull was in custody—he told me they were gone into the country —that it was in consequence of some sort of message from them be had come—I understood be bad the message from their own mouth—nothing occurred to give me an impression that be had seen the horses before Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Was it not Johnson who came to you first and spoke A Yes—he came alone to the best of my knowledge—it was not till he spoke to me that I saw Bull—I believe Bull is a horse-dealer MR CHAMBERS Q How do you know be is a horse-dealer A He came to me some time ago with a man I bad seen at Barnet—I asked Bull what he was—he said he was a horse-dealer and travelled the country COURT Q Did you not give Leonard the information to go to Wright s A No—I do not know Wright JOSEPH WRIGHT I am a cab proprietor living in Pelham-street Brick-lane On Sunday the 17th of October Leonard came to my place between ten and eleven o clock in the forenoon—I was in bed—he after that came again and brought a bay mare—I gave it up to the officer at the Featherstone-street station—it was claimed by Mr Ruck—Leonard sold me the mare—he told me he bad had it nineteen months—he came to me by the name of George Smith—I gave information myself to the Magistrate when I heard the man was in custody—I saw the same mare at the green-yard on the 26th of October when claimed by Ruck JOHN HARVEY police-constable G 118 I received a mare from Wright I took it to the green-yard in Bunhill-row—it was claim by Ruck THOMAS HENRY THOMPSON police-sergeant D 84 On the 13th of October I went to No 40 Homer-street Marylebone and in the front-room on the first-floor I found Bull and Johnson—I said to Bull Dick I have come after you —he said Very well I suppose I must go and in going to the station I asked if he knew what I was taking him for I said it was for the three horses—he said I did not steal them they were brought to me to the Stingo by Farren s man —I left him in the station and went back to Homer-street—I found Johnson remaining there—as I entered I saw him throw from him a bag—I took it up and found it contained twelve skeleton keys—I then said You are my prisoner —I found in his left band coat-pocket this cart-plate with the name of Thomas Blackburn farmer Tonbridge Kent on it—he said he had picked it up in the road coming from Kent—I then took him to the station Johnson I deny having such things about me EDWARD LONG I am a farmer living at Mersham in Kent On the night of the 11th of October I lost a black horse—I saw it again on the 26th of October at the green-yard at St Luke s—it was the horse that had been taken from ray stable—I saw another black horse before and made a mistake about its being mine—I lost a bridle and saddle at the same time—this is my saddle but the stirrups are not mine HENRY RUCK re-examined I received this saddle with the other from Collins and these two saddles from Inspector Harvey—Collins was present when I received them—one was my pannel-saddle Cross-examined by MR PRENDEROAST Q Where was it you received these A In Marylebone Court-house—I took them home—I kept my pannel saddle—they were both taken from the Court-house in a sack—they went down to the Borough where we slept that night—I received them in the Borough at the Nag s Head public-house on the 27th—I believe Gower took them home the next day—I did not part with my own—I cannot say where Mr Long took his MR CLARKSON Q Was one of the saddles yours A Yes it was a pannel-saddle—Collins was present when the two saddles were brought to the justice-room CHARLES GILBERT re-examined Mr Long s horse was brought home by Gower—the bridle came home on the horse—there was a saddle came home—I cannot say whether it was Mr Long s but to the best of my belief it was MR PRENDEROAST Q What became of

afterwards or not EDWARD LONG re-examined This is the saddle I lost on the night in question—my black horse is worth 25l —Crittle had been in my service four or five years since—I had had the black horse two years Cross-examined by—MR PRENDERGAST Q How do you know the saddle is yours A I had it made new and there is a flaw on it which I pointed out when I had it and one of the stirrups leathers

these two saddles were produced in the presence of Ruck—I do not know where these two came from but the two that I gave to Harvey I saw in the office—Harvey sent them by some one Cross-examined by MR PRENDEROAST Q Are you sure they were the same saddles A Yes—they were placed in the loft in the evening and the next morning I went to give the horses some hay at six o clock and I saw the saddles there—those saddles produced before the Magistrate were the same that I had had in my stable MR PRENDEROAST called the following witnesses for the defence — THOMAS BEIGHTON I am a sergeant in the grenadier-guards I know Leonard—I have had transactions with him—I remember the 11th of October very well—I saw Leonard on that day about one o clock or a very short time after—he was at my lodging which was then at No 12 Church-street Kensington—he was with me from five minutes past one till ten minutes before six o clock in the evening—we had a little discourse on former times—I had known him three or four years—I had lent him previous to that the sum of 5s and on that day we had four pints of porter and he paid me what I had lent him—he left me at Kensington-gate at ten minutes before six—I know the time because I went to parade—I know it was on the 11th of October because I came into waiting on the 12th—that is to attend to all military duties for a week—to keep the books and to warn every man to his duty that is what is called orderly sergeant in some regiments but we call it sergeant in waiting —my week expired on the Tuesday following—there are three sergeants who take it in turns fourteen days out and seven in—I am quite certain it was the 11th of October that I saw Leonard MR CHAMBERS Q What day of the week was it A On Monday and I went in waiting on the Tuesday at one o clock in Kensington barracks—I am attached to those barracks—I have no book here to show when I went on duty—I cannot bring the duty-book here—my name is down in the books—I have been looking at the books—it is given from sergeant to sergeant—it is not from looking at the book that I know of this—I cannot tell when I first heard of Leonard being taken—I was out of waiting at that time—it might be from eight to ten days after the 11th of October when I heard of this—I do not know when I was first called to give my evidence on this subject—I believe it was on Monday last—the solicitor served me with a subpoena—I had lodgings for my family—my wife was at home on the afternoon of the 11th of October—she is not here—she has a young baby to attend to and to work—she was at home to tea that afternoon—she knew Leonard before I did—Leonard was in the habit of visiting me at different times—the last time he visited me might be on the 4th of September—I know we had shifted quarters—we came from the Tower to Kensington and that was the time he borrowed the 5s —that was not at my house—I was at a public-house with him—I was not in waiting then—we are not allowed to go to public-houses when on waiting—we may drink at home but must keep ourselves sober—when I got my subpoena I looked in my casual rulebook to see what day it was I saw Leonard—I could not bring the casual rulebook here—it is wanted at seven o clock in the morning and again at one—they could not call the men s names over if I brought the book away—I could not have had it if I had asked the officer—the book lasts perhaps for six months—I have not seen Leonard since that day when he paid me the money—I had not not seen him between the time he borrowed the money and the time he paid it Q How do you know that it was not on Monday the 4th A I tell you I came in waiting the very day after—that is rather an extraordinary thing to me—I have duties to perform there which concerns myself and not other persons—I have the books to keep and to give them over to the other sergeant—Leonard asked me if I would go and see him—I said I was going in waiting the day following and could not get out of barracks—Iwas to go to see him at No 13 Beecham-street Paddington—I have seen Bull before—my wife is his sister MR PRENDERGAST Q Is Bull at all connected with Leonard A That is more than I can tell

Mr Scandelburg a master-builder at Bayswater and then Dann employed me at the job at Nottinghill—I have been at that job about a fortnight—I do not know what day of the month I went it was a fortnight last Monday—it was six weeks before that that I left the other job—I do not know what day of the month it was when I left my other job—I was not doing any thing for that six weeks—Ican read—I have not got an almanac—I have not seen one these six months to look at it—I was subpoenaed last Friday to come here—when Leonard was taken there was a talk about it in the house—I was not in the way—I was not doing any thing on the 11th or on the 12th of October—I cannot tell what sort of a day it was—I did not take any notice of that—Leonard had a hat on—when I came round the corner I saw him at the door—I recollect that it was on the 12th of October because we moved out of that house on the 13th—it did not rain when we moved—my mother and I moved out—I have only removed about five minutes walk from there—I did not inquire what Leonard was taken up for—he has been a friend of mine—I do not know the other prisoners—my mother and I had the front and back parlour in that house and Leonard had

September the prisoner came and asked if I could kill ten sheep for Mr Hill of Newgate-market—he said they were coming from Barnet and he had to go on the road to meet them—he did not know what time they would come—he asked if I could kill them that evening—I said yes if they came in soon—he came again about half-past seven with fifteen lambs—about a quarter to eight he struck the first lamb down—we went on and dressed the fifteen lambs—I found they were full of dung and I asked him if he recollected a case which occurred in White cross-street—he said he knew these were all right as Mr Hill was a respectable man—I killed the fifteen lambs and he said Mr Hill would be there at half-past three o clock—instead of that the prisoner came with another man at three o clock in the morning and said he would take ten of the worst away and leave five of the best—that these were going to Titmus and Dowding in Warwick-lane—when he was gone I went to Newgate-market and could not find them there—when I came back the prisoner and one Allen were waiting outside my door for the other five lambs and the skins—they asked if I had been up the market—I said No —I let them take the lambs and skins—I told Allen I thought these things were not right—after that I waited for a policeman coming and told him of the circumstance—I then went to Mr Hill in Newgate-market—he knew nothing about them—I inquired and found Mr Matthews had lost them—I am sure the skins produced are the skins which came off the lambs I killed Cross-examined Q Had you ever seen the prisoner before A Not to my knowledge—I was committed once for stealing from the person but there was no true bill found—I am in the habit of killing for different persons—the prisoner told me Mr Hill was recommended by Messrs

shop was not open—I inquired for Mr Hill and saw Sam Cotton—he said Mr Hill was not come—when I returned I let the five lambs go and fifteen skins—the prisoner asked me what the Iambs might cost—I said about 16s a piece—he said he did not know what they cost Mr Hill bought them and he supposed he got a cheap bargain—Hill is not here—I did not see this paper in the course of the night— looking at one —I swear I never saw any such paper—my suspicions had been excited in the night—I did not say I should like to have bought these sheep and I would girl something more for them WALTER HENRY

calf in Smithfield which were part of my uncle s cattle which I had seen on the Monday in the field JOHN MERRICK I am a farmer and live at Stan well-moor which is about sixteen miles from Hyde-park-corner I missed some cattle from my meadow on Thursday the 3rd of November—I bad not seen them for some time before—I examined the gate of the field and found the stick had been removed from the staple—on the Monday following I saw three of the cows two heifers and a calf at the Ram-yard Smithfield—they were worth about 50l before they went from home—I knew them to be mine and those which were in my field ELIHU LAMBERT City police-sergeant No 3 I received information on Friday the 4th of Nov in consequence of which I found some heifers at the west end of the market tied up and Mr Benson the salesman was with them—I also saw three cows and a calf at the east end of the market tied up and the prisoner with them—I asked him if they were his property—he said Yes —I asked where he had brought them from—he said at first that he had had them in his possession a week or ten days—I further questioned him and he said afterwards that he purchased them at Rom ford-market on the Wednesday previous—I asked who he purchased them of—he said he did not know—I asked whether he had paid for them in a bank or book-office in Romford-market—he said he had not—it is the custom of the market to pay for them in a bank—Mr Burrell a salesman was there at the time and he asked the prisoner if he had purchased them in Romford-market—he said he did—Burrell said it was no such thing they were not in Romford-market that he was there himself and likewise Mr Lowe another salesman and I went to Mr Lowe—I asked the prisoner where he lived—he said At No 9 Tottenham-row Kingsland and that he was a cow-keeper—I sent a person immediately to make inquiry there and after that person came back I immediately detained the prisoner and locked up the beasts—I showed them to Mr Merrick on the Monday following and he recognized them as his property Pritoner It is not a regular thing in Romford-market to pay for them in a bank only among the salesmen Witness It is in Smitbfield JAMES ROBERT

the morning two heifers were brought to the rail by a person named Pass—the prisoner shortly after came to me and said he wished me to sell them or words to that effect—he said his name was John Hill and that he had some at the other part of the market—I told him they were worth about 15l or 16l —I did not sell them in consequence of what I heard—I always attend Romford-market—I was there on the Wednesday before this Friday—I did not see these cattle there but I was standing in one place I should not be so likely to see them as others who go about the market—cattle are generally paid for at the bookingoffice at Romford-market—that is the custom—there are a few individuals perhaps who take their own money—I gave up the heifers to the officer JOHN LOWE I am a salesman and live in Oval-cottages Hackney-road On Friday the 4th of November I saw the prisoner coming down Long-lane with a small calf four cows and two heifers—he brought them close to my beasts—I bought the calf of him—I asked where he brought them from—he said at first from Kingsland—I said that living at Hackney myself I did not think I had seen any such cattle about there—he said they had been in the London-marshes and after that he said he had bought them at Romford on the Wednesday previous—I said I did not believe that for I was there myself and did not see any cattle of that description all the day—I was there from eight o clock in the morning till nearly three and went about the market all day and did not see any cattle like them there—I invariably pay at the book at the market—it is a rule but it is not always done—some persons take their own money—I saw the officer take the cows away and the calf which I had bought of the prisoner JAMES HARRINGTON butcher of Rutland-street Whitechapel On Friday the 4th of Nov about half-past eleven o clock I saw the prisoner there in Smithfield and he asked me to bny a cow—he asked me Si for it—I bid him 4l—he came to the top of the market and said I should have it—I came back paid for it and took it away—about an hour and a half afterwards in consequence of what Mr Burrell the salesman told me I went to the prisoner and said if I returned the cow would he return the money as I heard it was not right—he made a joke of it and said I had bought it in open market and I should abide by it—Romford-market is about twelve miles from Whitechapel-church Prisoner s Defence I bought them at Romford-market on the Wednesday they stood nndemeath the trees nearly opposite the bank—I gave 43l 5s for them and paid the money for them in the

a pig-jobber I have not sent for them there were plenty of people no doubt that saw me at the Bull JAMES BENSON re-examined It is possible that beasts that were at Stanwell at five o clock on Tuesday could be got to Romford-market on the Wednesday but it was a very long journey they would of course have the appearance of being much distressed Prisoner They were much distressed and one was very lame which was the reason I put them in the field at Kingsland I turned them into the London-marshes after buying them at Romford several persons saw them in the London-field a friend of Mr Burrell s did and I think Mr Lowe heard it said that they were there there JOHN LOWE re-examined I beard the prisoner say so and a person there said they were seen near the London-field but that they came quite

Kempsey in Worcestershire—I deal in fruit and garden-stuff On the 4th of May between eight and nine o clock at night I saw my horse safe on the pasturage near my house—I missed it between nine and ten next morning—in consequence of in—formation I came to town on the 3rd of Nov last with Mr Betteridge a neighbour and next day accompanied the policeman to the Paddington station and found the horse in possession of a man named Larkin at a stable at Bayswater—it was the horse I lost and was a gelding an irongrey—I have known the prisoner some time but have not seen him for fifteen years—he was bred and born at Kempsey Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q How long have you carried on business at Kempsey A Nine or ten years—I have also been a labourer—I never was away from Kempsey—I mentioned my loss to the police at the office at Worcester—the gelding was about five years old—I had bought it when a year and a half old from Williams a Welsh—man at Worcester fair Q Did you offer to take a sum of money from Larkin and go back to Worcester and say nothing more A No that is quite wrong—I said that when this trial was over I did not mind about taking it back again—I did not mind selling it—I expect to get it back after the trial but I do not mean to sell it—I asked him 10l for it—it it worth 12l and is about 14 hands high—I never measured it DAVID LARKIN I am a green-grocer and live at Bayswater I know the prisoner—I bought the horse claimed by the prosecutor of the prisoner—I have not known him a great while—I applied to him for a horse about two months before I bought it—he said he would get me one and brought two to my house on Friday the 3rd of May—I know it was the 3rd because I had four shoes taken off the horse on the 4th which was Saturday as I am informed—am positive it was the 3rd of May—I gave 15l for it Cross-examined Q Had you known him to be dealing in horses A Yes—this horse is improved very much since—it is much bigger—I should say it is 13 1/2 or 14 hands high but I am not much of a judge—it is very much increased in height since I had it COURT Q When did you first see the horse A The very day I bought it—it was brought to me in the morning in very poor condition and had come a long journey MR HOWARTH Q Is the horse higher as well as bigger than it was A Yes and any one that has seen the horse will feel a difficulty in swearing to him it has changed its colour I should call it almost a dapple-grey and he is fat instead of thin—he is outside the Court—he has not been clipped or touched at all COURT Q Have you been bargaining for the horse with Mr White A Last session we were about making a bargain—he offered me the horse for 7l but I did not buy it—I had put in a brief to claim the horse JOSEBH WALKER police-sergeant D 5 The prosecutor applied to me on a Sunday morning last Nov about a horse and I accompanied him round Bayswater—I knew where there were several horses that the prisoner had sold—I went with him to Larkin s house and found two horses there one of which the prosecutor claimed directly be saw it JURY to WILLIAM WHITE Q How do know this horse to be able positively to speak to it A By the marks on it it has got three white legs and one black one the fore leg—it has a little lump on the head over the eye which was done when I had it it also had a large scissors-mark on the hip and a brand mark on the hoofs but they are nearly or quite worn out—the hair was long and Larkin said he had pulled the hair out of the tail but had not docked it—a horse always grows from five to six years of age—the eyes are very middling to what they were then—the colour is not changed it stands very good—I can take my oath that it is my property—I have walked many hundred miles after it—I had seen all these marks before I lost it COURT Q Did you tell the policeman of any of these marks before you saw the horse A Yes—I had offered 5l reward for it and had described the animal in the advertisement in the Hue and Cry—this is the advertisement— read — Stolen or strayed on the 4th instant from Kempsey-common about five miles from Worcester an iron-grey halfbred horse five years old about fourteen hands high has a white mane and tail three white legs the off fore-leg black has a scissor-mark W on the off hip and a brand-mark W on both hoofs on the off side A reward of 5l will be paid on the apprehension and conviction of the offender or offenders Information to be given as above The date of the paper was the 24th of May DAVID LARKIN re-examined I have a witness outside who can swear to the horse—it is not what I should call an iron-grey it is a grey decidedly but there are so many differences in grey—it is not half-bred but what I should call the regular cart-horse breed—I cannot tell its age—I should say it was about fourteen hands high but I am not a judge and cannot speak to that fact—it has a grey mane and three white legs—the off foreleg is not black but a very dark grey—it has no scissors-mark and never had—I never saw such a mark anywhere—it was examined very particularly by twenty people in the neighbourhood—I found no brand-mark W —the farrier is here that took his shoes off on the Saturday the very next day—I do not know that the hoofs were touched WILLIAM WHITE re-examined The mark on the off hoofs is the mark of a burn near the front of the hoofs—I have not examined the hoofs since—I found all the other marks I have mentioned except the scissorsmark and I could see that when I was here before—I have not noticed it now for I have not had it in my possession only seen it at the door here—Larkin has had it ever since—it is a mark that would wear out in time—it was on it when I lost it and had been on about a month—I had put it on myself—I always marked it with W for White because I lost one before about nine years ago COURT to DAVID LARKIN Q You attended here at a former session A Yes expecting to be called as a witness—I have seen the prisoner once in prison—I went to him for the purpose of mentioning the circumstance—I did not know the date then no more did he at least he said the 3rd—I have witnesses here to prove the date it was bought was the 3rd—they are William Payne and Emily Hooper Q How came you to bring witnesses here A I stood naked and was obliged to seek for what evidence I could—I went to Mr Beok last Monday and asked him if he had any recollection of my buying a horse there in May—he said he booked everything—I stated to the policeman that I did not know the time at which I bought the horse I said it was very early in May but what day I could not say MR BALLANTINE called WILLIAM PAYNE I am a farrier at Mr Beck s at No 19 Northwharf-road Paddington I remember Larkin bringing a horse to our shop to have the shoes taken off—it was a grey horse as far as I can describe him—I cannot exactly say the height—I have seen the horse since—Mr Larkin brought him last week to know if we could recollect the horse coming to have his shoes taken off—I cannot recollect when it was brought but my master has looked through the books—he is not here—my master has got a clerk that keeps the books—they are not here nor is the clerk COURT Q Who brought you here A I came here with Mr Larkin—it was in May that he brought the horse—I could not see that it had any initial on it—the horse was new shod five days after as near as we can recollect—if there had been any brand-mark on the hoofs we should have seen it when we clenched the horse s feet up—I did not do that my—self I only took the shoes off when the horse was brought—I did not notice any brand-mark—we have had plenty of other horses to shoe but Larkin did not bring any other—we do not write down the marks of all the horses that come to us EMILY HOOPER My husband is an engineer I know Mr Larkin—on Friday the 3rd of May after tea I went and looked at a new horse he had bought—I am certain it was on Friday the 3rd of May COURT Q When was your attention called to this fact A To-day—I recollect the day because I had been to chapel the Sunday before which was the 28th of April after my confinement—my husband came and asked me to look at Mr Larkin s new horse and I went and looked at it—it was a grey horse—I live at No 36 Pickering-place—Mr Larkin is my brother-in-law and lives near us—I cannot be mistaken in the day—it was on Parliament Friday and I had been to chapel on the Sunday before and it was the first Sunday I had been out after my confinement—I recollect that I saw the grey horse the first week of my going out—I did not go out the next Sunday—I was not well—I did the Sunday after that with my sister who had been confined but not the following Sunday—Larkin is a greengrocer and my husband worked for him when he was out of a situation and he staid with him till he had the situation which was promised him—I was confined on the 8th of April Easter Monday—I saw the horse in Mr Larkins s stable—he had another horse there—they generally take me to see the horses—I see all of them—I saw the last when he bought it—that was a grey horse—I do not know when that was or how long before my confinement MR HOWARTH Q Then Larkin had a grey horse before this A Yes I believe it was a grey horse—I have since seen the horse that I saw on the 3rd of May—my husband is at work at a railway at Bradford in Yorkshire—I was not well enough to go to church on the fourth Sunday after my confinement—I have not been well since—I was not quite well on the Friday when I went to see this horse—it is only next door but one to where I live MR BALLANTINE Q You have not been examined by any attorney A No nor made any statement—I came here with Mr Larkin—I did not know I should be examined The Jury retired to look at the horse and stated that it answered the description given by prosecutor See First Session p 18 and Magnay Mayor Twelfth Session p 845 GUILTY * Aged 58 — Transported for Ten Years

t18470510-1170  1170 WILLIAM JOHN WORLY was indicted for stealing 1 sheep price 2l the property of William Webb MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution JOHN BROWN I am in the employ of Mr Webb a butcher in Newport-court Soho On the 12th of April about three o clock in the afternoon I drove eight sheep into the slaughter-house which is right opposite the place I had driven them out of in Princes-court—I locked the door and took the key down to the shop—I went back again between five and six o clock in the evening—the sheep were safe then—I locked the door up again—I went to the slaughter-house again between eight and nine o clock—I found the door was half open—I had left both the doors locked between five and six and I found one of them open between eight and nine—I got a light and found that there were only seven sheep out of the eight—inconsequence of something that was told me I went to the prisoner s shop in Newport-alley with my fellow-servant who is my master s foreman—I heard him ask the prisoner if he had got a stray sheep that did not belong to him—he denied it and said he had not got one—my fellow-servant asked him Are you sure —he said Yes I am —he said he had not got one there— he came up out of the cellar when we went into the shop —my fellow-servant said to me Go and fetch a constable —the prisoner said For God s sake don t fetch one I have got the sheep here I have got a stray sheep —in the mean time the constable came up and my fellow-servant said I shall give that man in charge for taking a sheep —the prisoner said For God s sake let me alone I will go and fetch Cranshaw he knows all about it —he was then in the alley in front of his own shop—when my fellow-servant gave him in charge the policeman laid hold of his arm and he took and ran away—I ran after him and the constable ran and caught him in St Martin s-lane brought him back and my master gave him into custody—after they came back from the office I went down into the cellar under the prisoner s shop—I found the sheep there and brought it up from the cellar which the prisoner was down in when we went to his shop—it was one of the eight sheep which was the property of Mr Webb and was worth 2l —I found a piece of iron bar lying alongside the slaughter-house door and the lock was found inside—it must have been broken open Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q This is a common slaughter-house is it A No—there is a common slaughter-house opposite but this is where we keep the sheep and kill sheep and calves and such like—there is a common slaughter-house opposite—the beef slaughter-house that is what we call a slaughter-house—this is a place where we keep sheep and calves—no other people kill there barring my master—other persons keep sheep there—every master butcher who has things put there has a key—Mr Cooper the landlord of the place gives them keys—there were no other sheep in our place that night but there were sheep in other parts—when you open the gate or door you get into a place as large as this Court is and one part is penned off for us another for one of our neighbours and different parts for other persons—when you open the door you may go to any place there—I believe the prisoner was not in the habit of going there—I never saw him there in my life—the prisoner said he wanted to find Cranshaw and said he knew all about it but Cranshaw knew no more about it than giving the prisoner a lift up with the sheep—Cranshaw went up to the office to clear himself and said he knew no more about it than giving him a lift up with the sheep—the prisoner ran away for the purpose of fetching Cranshaw but he went a different road—the way to Cranshaw s is close by where the market-house is but I do not know where Cranshaw was at that time—the prisoner ran away from his own shop and said he wanted to fetch Cranshaw—my fellow-servant said to the prisoner I believe you have got a stray sheep here that don t belong to you —there was no one there but me and my fellowservant—his name is Aldous—he is not there—the prisoner denied having a sheep—Aldous asked him if he had got a stray sheep that did not belong to him—he said I have got no sheep —Aldous said Are you sure —he said Yes —Aldous said I will swear the sheep I saw there was Mr Webb s—I can swear to the mark on it—it was marked twice across the loins and once round each eye—all the sheep my master has are marked in that way with red ochre which is the common thing for marking sheep with—other sheep are marked in a different way—the man who gave a lift up with the sheep saw it—Cranshaw is not here—I did not mark the sheep myself—I suppose the drover did or my master—I was not present when it was marked—the sheep were not marked that day—they had been in the place two or three days—they came from Croydon—I know that this particular sheep was marked the same as the others were—the sheep I found in the prisoner s cellar had the same mark as the others—I had seen all the sheep in Mr Webb s place—I never saw the prisoner with the sheep till I went to his shop MR PAYNE Q When you went to your master s place between five and six o clock were all the eight sheep safe A Yes—there were other persons sheep there—those other persons have not occasion to force the door and break the lock—they have keys—I have no doubt about that HENRY GOODHHERHAM police-constable C 169 On the 12th of

him—he was stopped in St Martin s-lane and I took him back—I went to the cellar under his shop—I saw the sheep and saw it brought up—the witness appeared to know it—the prisoner admitted taking it both to me and to the Magistrate—this is Mr Bingham s writing to this deposition—the prisoner s statement was read over to him— read— The prisoner says I had the sheep in my premises nearly an hour I found it lying in Princes-row I tied its legs and took it home —this is the sheep s-foot and the lock of the door and the iron bar that were in the slaughter-house—this is the sack with which the sheep was covered—this would hide its loins—the sheep was alive—I did not see the sheep in this sack—it was given me by the owner of the property WILLIAM TEARS I live at the white Hart in Newport-market On the 12th of April I saw the prisoner come out of the market-house door with this sheep on his back—I gave him two lifts up after that as it was too heavy—he could not hold it—he was going towards his home—I saw him come out of the market-house door and shut the door after him Cross-examined Q Are you sure he shut the door A Yes—he turned round to do it and walked on deliberately till he got two doors from our place and he dropped the sheep—we thought he could not get it up himself and we gave him a lift—I knew the prisoner and knew his name—he has three names Warley Ducket and Wingrove—I knew him very well by those three names—Swift Kirby was with me and he helped the prisoner up with it and Cranshaw helped him up with it—there were two of us helped him the first time and three the last time—Cranshaw was one that helped him the last time—he was in the parlour of the house where I am potman at the time the sheep was lost—I was in a little mess once about the marrow-bones and cleavers—that was not much of a mess and once they wanted to bring me in✗ for some fat—I got off with that—it was quite an accidental thing my seeing the prisoner go by—he did not ask me to keep it a secret—I had no share in this—this was a very short distance from the prosecutor s house and a very short distance from the prisoner s house MR PAYNE Q Where were you when you saw the prisoner coming out with the sheep on his back A Just by Mr Kirby s door the White Hart in Newport-market—he had not got seven yards from our door before we were obliged to help him—I did not see him break the door open SWIFT KIRBY I live at the White Hart Newport-market I was standing at the door with Tears—I helped the prisoner up with the sheep twice—he dropped it about six or seven yards from our door—I did not see where it came from Cross-examined Q Did you know the prisoner before A No more than by sight—he did not tell me that there was any secret in it—he told me nothing about it COURT Q Was anything over the sheep A Yes—a piece of cloth or a bag or what you please to call it—it was tied all over its back with one leg hanging out WILLIAM WEBB I am the proprietor of the sheep—I saw it in the cellar—I knew it again—it was one out of the eight of my sheep—to carry a sheep they usually tie three legs together but we generally drive them Cross-examined Q You had not seen the sheep before A Yes I bought it—I do not buy a thing without seeing it—if I buy a flock I generally handle them all very particularly—I did not mark these sheep my drover marked them—there were thirteen in the lot—I did not go into the market-house to see the sheep after it was there—I never go there—I did not see it driven into the market-house—I do not know that it was there but it was my sheep—I saw it in the cellar and put it in an opposite neighbour s place and got it out the next morning—there was no sack on the sheep—it was running about loose in the little cellar—there was no other sheep

treat his cattle—I told Larby that he must go to Mr Harris and he had better call on me on Friday and I would settle with him—I gave him the account of what they were sold for—on the Friday I was at Smithfield—the account Larby came there and produced a note—I made some excuse and said I did not know the writing I was going to Islington and would call on Mr Harris if he would give me his

not know me again A I did not see you till you came up to me—I knew you after you spoke to me—I asked you your name and you said Harris and you had come to take the account—I do not believe you said you had come to take the account for Jobs Harris you said you came as John Harris to take the account—you did not say that Harris had sent you for the account COURT Q You say he always spoke and acted

Islington Larby lodged with me three or four months—I knew Harris as Frederick Marchant—I did not know him till the day week that he was taken up—on 1st March he came between three and four o clock

get the man to come where I got my shirt on Sunday —Larby then said I will come and glad of it and thank you —Larby got up—they both went out together—Harris came back between eight and nine and remained in the house the most part of the day—he said he was very ill that he was sent to Romford with some cattle and he had sent his mate—Larby came back at night said he had been to Romford and had earned four or five shillings and he would be able to give me on or two next day—on the Friday when he came home I said You are a pretty boy you did not give me the few halfpence you promised me —he said Mother I did not get it for I think there is some mull in it —he was afraid there was something in it—I saw Harris writing a few lines on the Friday morning bay I do not know what it was—there was not one there but him and me—Larby came in afterwards Harris Q when did you know Larby had been with the cattle A On the Wednesday morning he told me so—I did not ask you where you had been and you did not say Into Thames-street and the Kent-road —you went out between three and four in the morning—I heard you come back before Larby WILLIAM BURGESS City policeman 28 I received Harris into custody—I told him the charge—he said nothing—from what was told me afterwards I took Larby—I made him no promise or threat—he said I am afraid this will turn out to be a bad job about these

conducted the Prosecution JOHN BARFOOT I am ostler in the employ of Thomas Shirley a liverystable keeper in Whitechapel-road On 8th July in the middle of the day the prisoner Knight came to the yard with this order— read— July 8th 1850 Mr Croft —Sir —Please send by bearer a horse for a chaise for C Ruck and Son W Lucking —Mr Lucking is a customer and is in the habit of having horses on hire—I gave the order to the foreman and he gave it to the hackerman and told him to let him have a horse—a halter and collar was to be given with it—I next saw the horse on the Thursday following in the possession of Knock the officer—it was worth 20l RICHARD PLEDGER I live with my father a farmer at Maiden On 9th July I saw the prisoners there—they offered a horse for sale—Splevin ran it to show its paces—they asked 10l for it—my father said he would give them 5l —they said that was too little—afterwards Splevin said he would take 8l then he came to 7l and at last he said he would take 5l —we thought all was not right so we sent them on about a mile and a half further and said we would meet them there with the 5l if it was all right—we gave information to the police and gave the horse to him—there was a collar with it FRANCIS KNOCK I am superintendent of the Essex constabulary In consequence of information from Mr Pledger I apprehended the prisoners at Blatchenden about four miles from Maiden and charged them with stealing a horse—Knight gave his name as James Phillips and said he had the horse to sell for a person of the name of Booker a grocer of Elizabeth-terrace Tooting Surrey—they both said so—I said I should go to London that night or next morning and ascertain whether that was true—about half an hour afterwards they sent for me and Knight said It is no use it will only aggravate the case by telling this falsehood we did not get the horse of Mr Booker we got it of Mr Croft of Whitechapel —that Splevin wrote the order for it in the name of Ruck signed Lucking —Splevin was present when he said that—Mr Pledger handed me over the horse which I gave to Mr Shirley—on searching the prisoners I took a bottle from Knight which contained morphia and from Splevin I took a quantity of skeleton keys—when I took the morphia from Knight he said I had this from Splevin he took it out of his pocket while riding the horse because it hurt him —I asked Splevin where he got it—he said he found it—he also said he found the keys which I took from him Splevin I was not present when Knight made the statement we were taken separately into a private room Witness They were both present and quarrelled about it—Splevin denied what Knight asserted—they made the same statement on several other occasions WILLIAM LUCKING I am a commercial traveller in the employ of Ruck and Son provision agents I have been occasionally in the habit of bring horses at Croft s livery-stables—Knight was formerly in our employ as porter and was discharged—this paper is not my writing—I did not authorise Knight to take that to Croft s to get a horse for me on 8th July—he had no authority to get a horse for me that day Knight I had notice to leave but had not left I should have been at work that week Witness He did not come near the place to work as be ought to have done—I was on a journey at the time—he has been five or six months in the employ—I should think he would not have been taken without a character—I think he had previously been for a few months with a brother of Mr Ruck—I never heard anything against him Knight s Defence I had unfortunately been out with my fellow-prisoner on the Sunday evening and we stayed out all night drinking I ought to have been in business at eight o clock in the morning and it was past sine when I found myself asleep in the public-house I was ashamed to go then indeed I was not in a condition to go I was going home when I was told to stop and take more drink which I did soon after it was proposed that we should spend the day by taking a drive and Splevin said if I knew where to get a horse he knew where there was a nice cart and harness I said I did not he said Did not my governors ever have a horse I said yes and told him where from he wrote the order and I went with it he stood outside while I went in and got the horse and we went away together we could nut get the cart and I wanted to take the horse back Splevin said he would go on and sell the horse he wanted to get away and wanted a few pounds I did not know what to do then I was very anxious to take it back he said he knew a party lower down who might lend us a cart and when we got there he said it was no use going any further we did not seem likely to get a cart I was very much intoxicated it was proposed to put the horse up for the night after I went up to my bedroom I found all my money gone from my pocket about 7s 1 asked Splevin about it and he said he had taken it on purpose to keep me from going back I told him I should go back and if possible take the horse with me for I was very much afraid we should be found out I had no idea of committing anything wrong or of selling the horse my idea was if I used the order that I should not have to put down any deposit I had only a few shillings in my pocket and Splevin said I might go afterwards and pay for the horse as if I had come from my master I am very sorry that through drink and persuasion I have committed myself as I have done Splevin s Defence I was given to understand that the horse was the property of a bankrupt residing at Tooting I met Knight promiscuously about four days before the transaction and he represented to me that he had to sell it we were together all Sunday night and on the Monday morning he left me near Spitalfields Church and went away not telling me where he was going he fetched the horse and we went to Romford but there being no fair there I took him down to some friends in the country he had but half- a-crown in his pocket and I had 6d when I was searched we did not sleep in a bed we slept in the stable the keys found on me were common keys the others were not found in my possession RICHARD PLEDGER re-examined Knight came to me first with the horse—it was Splevin that asked 10l for it—he led the horse—Knight said The other young man has got a horse to sell and that they were recommended by their cousin whose name was Birchell Splevin That is a cousin of mine residing there I took it to him as I was authorised to sell it by Knight and he was to pay the expenses and he referred me to this person

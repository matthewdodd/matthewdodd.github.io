it has not been in my possession ever since I made no mark on it but I feel satisfied it is the same JOHN SLOUGH I am a painter and live in Chichester-place St Pancras I know Goodman very well - I saw him and Long coming up Liverpool-street St Pancras with a truck about half-past two o clock on Wednesday the 3d of June - there was one sheet of lead in it they drew it up to the side of the street to a house not built and shot the lead out - Goodman asked me to mind it while they got another he said they were going to take it to John-street - he pulled off his hat and wiped his face I said I would look to it while I was there - they went away together the constable came in about threequarters of an hour and took the same lead Cross-examined Q Had you known Long before A No but I am sure it was him WILLIAM NICHOLLS I am a constable On the 3d of June I went to Liverpool-street and saw a sheet of lead - this is a piece of it I saw Slough there - I shewed the lead to a gentleman who is not here and to Mount Stephens Cross-examined Q What did you do with it A Locked it up in a coach-house I then took it to Hatton-garden Office SAMUEL BRIGGS Long was in our employ - I believe this note to be his writing it was not written by my authority Cross-examined Q Have you seen him write A I have seen his writing on a slate - I could not swear I have seen it elsewhere COURT Q Do you feel confident that it is his writing A Yes JOHN BLAKE I am a constable I took the prisoners in the Northumberland Arms public-house Bagnigge-wells-road about half-past five o clock that day I said I had suspicion that they were wanted for some lead I must take them in and wait for a person who would identify them - they said they had not done any thing but if I had waited a little longer perhaps they might have done something they said they were both out of employ and had a right to get the best living they could- I do not recollect their saying any thing more I said if they said they were not guilty and knew those who were I would go and take them - Long said he knew nothing of it and the other said he did not choose to answer the question I asked where the lead was and they both said they knew nothing about it - there were two trunks at the door of the Northumberland Arms which I took on the Friday to Hatton-garden I asked the prisoners whose they were and Goodman I think it was said he did not choose to tell me Prisoner GOODMAN Q Did I not say if you would wait you might see the person who employed us A No you said you might have done something SAMUEL MOUNT STEPHENS I am a constable I went to the Northumberland Arms and assisted in securing the prisoners - there were two trunks in front of the house which we put in a cow-yard opposite the name of Elliott Little Sutton-street was on one of them - I went to Brick-lane Old-street on the Sunday and found a sheet of lead on Mr Compton s premises I took possession of it and have a piece of it here - there is No 4184 on it the reason we took it was because there was another sheet wanting and from the marks given at the office we thought this was the sheet described by Mr Walker s foreman Cross-examined Q Where are the marks A These are them - they are not so plain as when I first saw them here are other marks on it - here is 25 1/2 7020 and 20 FRANCIS ELLIOTT I am a Wheelwright and live at No 8 Little Sutton-street Clerkenwell On Wednesday the 3d of June Long came to me between twelveand one o clock to hire a truck I asked him what it was for - he said to take some lend from near St Pancras church to John-street or John s-lane I do not knew which he said he was recommended by Mr Thomas and as I knew him I lent Long the truck - he never returned it but I saw it at the Green-yard on the Monday following the officer told me he had it locked up - my name was on it THOMAS PARSONS I am a labourer in the service of Messrs Walker and Parker I know these pieces of lead are theirs - I delivered two pieces of lead to Quin and by the weight and the number I know these to be the same Cross-examined Q Where did you get these numbers A From the books I did not put down the number at the time - it was put down by one of the clerks I did not see it put down - I called out the number and can recollect them for a day or two MR CLARKSON Q Did you see the number on the lead before you put it into the cart A Yes these are the numbers I called out that day and I am able to say these are the numbers I saw on the lead COURT Q How soon after that day did you look in the book A I got this account from the book the day before yesterday WILLIAM JADDINE I knew Goodman by his living at a public-house as servant I have seen him score his beer but I do not know whether he can write - I received this letter but do not know who wrote it JOSEPH NEALE I know Goodman s writing this is his writing - I found this lead and gave information to Mount Stephens and he got it Prisoner GOODMAN Q I cannot write at all where did you ever see me write A At Mr Sims Prisoner GOODMAN I never lived there a day in my life Witness Yes you did you have been there several days together reading and writing to keep yourself employed WILLIAM QUIN re-examined Q Who went with you A Goodman to the bottom of Fleet-street he then said I have to go in the City to see some more of our men you deliver this note to Walker and Parker the note was sealed up but I saw the direction on it - he said If I don t overtake you take it to No 25 Dean-street Soho but he came to me about the same spot where we parted and said I have a further order to take this to the Small Pox-hospital where we have to gutter some little cottages - I took it there and Goodman took it from my cart I came home and thought it my duty to let Mr Briggs know it The note was here read To Messrs Walker Parker and Co Red Bull-wharf Upper Thames-street SIR - Please to let bearer have 1 sheet of 4lb milled lead and 1 sheet of 5lb ditto ditto S M BRIGGS & SON June 3 1829 25 Dean-street Soho GOODMAN s Defence I was at Mr Parr s office two men came and asked if I wanted work -

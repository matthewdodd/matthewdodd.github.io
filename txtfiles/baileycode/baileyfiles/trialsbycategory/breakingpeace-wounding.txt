t18280221-45  Before Mr Baron Vaughan 527 WILLIAM HOWARD alias JOSHUA BELL was indicted for feloniously assaulting William Mullay a subject of our Lord the King on the 12th of February at St George the Martyr and with a certain sharp instrument striking and cutting him in and upon the left hand with intent to rob him against the statute &c SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH COUNTS stating his intent to be to kill and murder him to disable him or do him some grevious bodily harm FIFTH COUNT stating his intent to be to resist and prevent his lawful apprehension and detainer SIXTH COUNT for feloniously assaulting the said William Mullay with intent to rob him and his goods chattels and monies from his person and against his will MR LAW conducted the prosecution WILLIAM MULLAY I was in London in January last and on one day in the beginning of this month I put an advertisement in the paper and on the 8th I received a letter in consequence of which I called on the prisoner and had some conversation with him I produced the letter to him he did not state from whom that letter came but seemed to know what I came about I was desirous of procuring some situation but had not mentioned that it was to be under government I had provided myself with a sum of money as a premium for it The place I went to was No 36 Red Lion-square I was shown to a room on the top floor behind the projection of the building I had to go up stairs as if I was going to the leads of the house I then turned off down some other stairs through a narrow passage two or three feet wide which brought me into a room not more than nine feet square there is a window in it and a fire-place which projects there was a table and two chairs I got there I think about three o clock on Friday the 8th of February and staid there until about four o clock He told me he had a friend who was a man of consequence and had a great deal of influence though he had run through a large fortune and through him he could procure me some employment and as a beginning of the business I was to lodge 300l in a banker s hands in my own name and to call on him the following day or on the Monday to lodge the money I went the following day and told him I had not brought the money and told him I thought Monday might do as well We had some further conversation on the business and I said I did not care or it was of no consequence to me if I were to lodge more money It was then agreed that I should on the Monday lodge 450l On the Monday I called about two o clock and told him I had changed my mind and I would only lodge 300l he then observed that his employer would think I was going back from my agreement and think that he had not acted in a proper manner On that day I saw a long bladed knife with a buckhorn handle which laid open upon the shelf I cannot say whether it was a clasp knife as I did not take it in my hand - when the prisoner made these observations I told him I was always a man of my word or words to that effect and I would lodge the 450l in the course of the day and to prove it I showed him 400l He then made me write a note to a Mr Owen which was the first time I had heard the name of Owen mentioned in it I mentioned that I would lodge the 450l and Howard and I were to call on him at one o clock the following day which would be Tuesday I was to call on the prisoner at half-past twelve o clock and go with him to Owen s we parted about five o clock On the next day I went about half-past twelve o clock and had upwards of 500l in two pockets - I had three 100l Bank notes two of 50l a Bank post-bill for 98l and some sovereigns At this interview Howard told me that Mr Owen had to go to Change and couldnot be at home at one o clock but he would call at Howard s at two o clock and he begged me to wait till he came which I consented to do he made some observations about my being cold he put some coals on the fire and put the poker into it it remained there some time when it fell out he put it in again it remained some time and I took it out again myself - he put it into the fire again and observed to me that it would make the fire burn After some time it fell out on the hearth-rug and burnt it and he did not afterwards put it in I observed in the room a trap bat which I had not seen before he had it a good deal in his hand and said he purchased it to beat or to keep the cat out of his room - the conversation afterwards turned on various subjects two o clock came Mr Owen did not appear but Howard appeared to be every moment expecting him he did not remain in the room all the time but went in and out a great deal - as well as I can recollect he walked up and down almost all the time I told him I wanted to be at home before five o clock as I lived at Chelsea and was going out to dinner About two o clock he began to get very agitated and complained a great deal of Mr Owen s conduct I remained till half-past three o clock and then told him I could stay no longer and he proposed that there should be a new appointment made to meet Mr Owen and it was agreed that I should call on Howard at ten o clock or as soon after as I could on the following day this was to be communicated to Owen by a note which I wrote when I had done I showed it to Howard who said that I ought to have made it a good deal sharper or words to that effect and after a few observations he sat down and wrote one for me to copy - this note is not here but here is a part of my copy of it the note he wrote was a long one and in that he stated that we should call at ten o clock at Owen s I said How can we go to Owen s at ten o clock when I am to be here at ten o clock - he replied You are peevish I said on some occasions I might be so I sat down and commenced the copy of the note and had nearly finished it when I saw my hat which had hung on a nail behind me in Howard s hand and he put it either on a chair at the other corner of the room or threw it on the floor he immediately came back again behind me as I was leaning down to write and hit me at the top of the head with the bat - it immediately occured to me that he intended to murder and rob me I got up he came more in front of me and hit me with the bat on my forehead - it bled immediately over my face so much so as to dim my sight with the blood I immediately closed upon him and threw him he fell I think sideways for his left hand was stretched out and I observed in it a knife which appeared to me to be the one I had previously seen I laid hold of it by the blade he had fallen about three or four feet from the fire-place and while I had hold of the knife with one hand I stretched out the other and got hold of the poker with which I gave him some blows on the head he had all this time hold of the handle of the knife and by holding the blade my hand began to be cut I then threw the poker out of my hand to lay hold of the blade with my right hand my left being cut - in doing that he got up we were still struggling but I did not fall at all he still had hold of the handle of the knife and I had only hold of the blade when he first began on me I cried Murder and he told me in the course of the struggle it was no use to bawl or cry as he had help at hand or words to that effect and on one or two occasions he called John John - when we were up I got hold of the bat and gave him some blows with it in front of his head but I let go of the bat as my whole attention was on the knife and in a short time I broke the blade off near the handle and held it in my own hand for perhaps a minute or two thinking it might be of some service to defend myself but I found I could not use the blade and I threw it on the floor I cannot well say how the prisoner held the handle of the knife but he held it firmly and I could not get but broke it - the knife was in motion when I broke it I had then nothing in my hand to defend myself I threw him again and began to kick him with my heel about that time there were people at the door I heard them speak but the door was locked - he had passed in and out frequently he had not locked it every time nor do I know when he had locked it - I did not observe whether I found the door locked on my former visits but on one occasion I think on the Monday I told him to shut the door which was open and it appeared to me to have no other means of fastening but by turning the key When the people came to the door I thought they came to help Howard and he asked me to let him get up and said he would tell me all about it I did so but still held him he appeared greatly agitated or exhausted I cannot tell which and said to me Will you promise me one thing or words to that effect I asked him what it was he did not reply for some time and I asked him again - he then said Will you say it was a quarrel and under the idea that he had help outside the door I promised him I would We then went and unlocked the door and I saw the landlord of the house or the man who keeps the shop and a painter whom I had seen in the house going backwards and forwards and two other persons I then felt at ease as to any danger and came out of the room and said that Howard had made an attempt to murder me some one then came down stairs with me and I showed my money to the first person I spoke to to the constable and to the surgeon When I went into that room I had a ring on my finger and when I came out I found myself without it I have seen it since and I have seen a bat and a knife similar to those I saw in the room My wounds were dressed and I was sent home Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How long have you been from Ireland A About three months I had been in England frequently before and had advertised for some employment but I do not think I had advertised for a public situation I had advertised for a mercantile one about four times not more The prisoner said I was peevish and occasionally I am so if I see a person do an absurd thing but if I thought a fraud was about to be practised on me or I were to be made the dupe of another person that would not be likely to rouse my peevish feelings I can state on my oath that I was not peevish on that occasion and the prisoner had no reason for making that observation My note will show that I did not consider that Mr Owen was ill treating me nor did I think that Howard was I did not consider that the delay was extraordinary The lodging into which I went was in a very obscure situation there was a pillar and claw table and two chairs in the room there might be other things but theroom was very scantily furnished - but the furniture was very clean The whole sum I was to give was something between 500l and 800l It did not strike me that this was rather an extraordinary place to go to for the purpose of seeing an influential person or his agent - Howard said I was to meet him there The only thing that struck me was that it was a very quiet place and a curious one the passage to it is about three feet wide I think the first time I showed the prisoner the money I had in my pocket was on the Monday I did not show him any on the Tuesday and I cannot exactly tell whether any conversation took place between me and him respecting money on Tuesday the first conversation respecting the banker s was on the Monday and on the Tuesday he was making an observation on Mr Owen s going with me to the banker s and he was consulting me to know whether he would be wanted to go he said if I chose he would go he did not ask me any questions that morning to induce me to show him the money my going to any banker s was to depend on whether Mr Owen came I think I got there on the Tuesday at half-past twelve o clock and when I came out of the room it was about four o clock I never described the bat as a cricket bat there had been some coals put on the fire before he put the poket in I did not state before the magistrate that after he put the poker in the fire I myself drew it out twice or that he put it in twice and that I drew it out as often he put it in three times and I drew it out once - I am quite positive that I did not on that Tuesday drink anything with him on the Monday I drank some gin and water which he asked me to do as I appeared wet I think I was not wet on the Tuesday there might be a splash on me I do not mean to state that his saying I was cold and putting the poker into the fire was a circumstance calculated to alarm me in fact it did not alarm me - I have never said it did I was the only person in the room with him when the poker fell from the fire the second time and burnt the hearth-rug he took it into his hand and put it under the ashes or by the side of the fire-place very circumstance with reference to it was of an ordinary nature till I took hold of it I did not on the two previous days take particular notice of the room and its appendages The bat and the knife might have been there on the Friday and Saturday but I did not see them till the Monday I was writing when I saw my hat in the prisoner s hand but I did not see him take it down as it was behind me it might have fallen It is a very small room if he had intended to rob me he might have stuck me to the heart with the knife I did not at the last meeting express great indignation at Owen for not coming and never said it was all a humbug Howard was making some observations on him for not coming but I never joined for up to the time I was attacked I considered the transaction bona fide Q Now Sir upon the oath you have taken and recollecting your back was to the prisoner when you were first struck was it not a blow with the fist A No that I will swear - it was a very severe blow but I was not stunned- when I turned round the prisoner had the bat in his right hand he appears to be a weaker man than I - I threw him twice and the only difficulty I had in any part of the transaction was to get the knife he had the knife in his left hand I could hold the knife and reach the poker with which I gave him perhaps three blows with a good deal of force on the head I cannot well tell whether the knife continued in his left hand but I had it occasionally in both hands and always by the blade the first time I saw it in his hand was the moment he fell - he did not fall near the shelf where I had seen it lay - that I will swear he had the bat in his right hand when he fell - he did not fall from a blow - I threw him I had not the poker in my hand at the time he fell when the persons were at the door he did not add that he would give me satisfaction when and where I liked he did not state that he bought the bat as a present to his landlord s child that I remember though I will not swear he did not a black cat did come into the room and he used the bat to drive it out - I will not swear that he did not say at the time that the bat had been bought for a different ball than so black a one and it would answer the purpose as well as any thing else - he might have said so but I have no knowledge of it he might have sat down with me but I swear that the greater part of the time he was walking about - he appeared agitated and irritated and accounted for it by the absence of Owen as well as I can remember I stated before the Magistrate that in the course of struggle he called John John I am almost positive that I did I cannot call to my mind whe ther any one said at the door that they would burst it open if it were not opened - it might have been said I have not examined the premises since I cried Murder loudly but I do not know whether it was heard at the next house - I do not know whether I could have overpowered the prisoner I admit that I broke the knife before I threw him for the last time I cannot tell how long a time elapsed between my going out of the room and securing the prisoner for I was below stairs - I cannot tell whether he was left alone I did not mind whether I saw any persons in the house when I went to meet him on the Tuesday when he asked me to say it was a quarrel I promised to do so under the supposition that his friends were at hand I do not think that in the agitation of the moment I could have been mistaken as to the expressions he used in respect of help I cannot say which of the two were most wounded there was some conversation about bills but the 450l was bona fide to be left MR LAW Q A surgeon attended you A Yes and I showed him the state I was in I was not wounded in any respect when I went there CHARLES FREDERICK CHEESE I live at No 36 Red Lion-square the prisoner lodged in the house and occupied two attics I believe - I think he had entered on his fourth week On the day of this transaction I went up stairs about four o clock upon hearing the cry of Murder I returned and procured the poker and in my passage up again I asked a painter to go up with me which he did I went to the door of the prisoner s apartment where I heard a scuffling I knocked and demanded the cause of it - a dead silence ensued for a few moments when I heard a half-suppressed voice pronounce the words Will you premise - I then demanded admittance more loudly than before some one from within desired me to retire saying it was only a quarrel and all settled I said I should like two voices to tell me that it was settled the assertion was then repeated by the same voice that all was settled but on myasserting that I had persons with me who would not be satisfied without admittance the door was immediately unlocked- I opened the door and took the prosecutor down stairs to a back kitchen or rather scullery he said he had 500l about him but I did not see him produce it from his pocket Cooke the constable took the prisoner into custody when he was taken I heard him express that which would lead us to conclude that they had only been quarrelling he said he thought it unfair that the prosecutor s individual evidence should be received in preference to his own and they ought to have been allowed to fight it out fair - I do not recollect that the prosecutor made any complaint in his presence about what had happened the prisoner and prosecutor were both wounded and the prosecutor was bleeding copiously - I recollect the prisoner saying that the circumstance of the door being locked was against him but he endeavoured to explain it by saying that there was no other fastening to the door and the lock being inside he had locked it to prevent the inconvenience of sitting in a draught - he had locked it he stated that he had been accused of assaulting the prosecutor but made no direct reply I have a ring which I received from a little boy who is now in Court Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Did he say that circumstances were against him or that they appeared against him A That they were against him and he accounted for it by stating that the door was locked but that that was the only way of fastening it I stated at the door that I would not be put off with the reply which I had heard and to the best of my judgment it was the same voice said It is only a quarrel as said Will you promise there was no contradiction made by any other voice though I had explained the object of my coming - the prisoner all along stated that it had been a quarrel I do not remember that any thing was said to me by any one when the door was first opened I took hold of the prosecutor s hand and took him down stairs in going down I asked what it was about and he said the man had attempted to murder him - he never assented to the representation of the prisoner that it was a quarrel he told but one story from beginning to end to the best of my belief the prisoner was left alone up stairs - he was apprehended in about half an hour but he could not well have escaped as there were persons at the door and on the stairs JURY Q Why did you take the prosecutor to the kitchen in preference to any other part of the house A Because I generally occupy the kitchen for my family and knowing that his wounds wanted washing I took him there EDWARD COOKE I am a constable and live at No 33 Red Lion-square I was sent for between three and four o clock and the prosecutor gave me the prisoner in charge I went into the sitting-room occupied by the prisoner where I found this bat - I saw a poker there and the glass of the window was broken I searched the prisoner and found on him 5d in halfpence I went into his bed-room and found a hat a cap a waistcoat two old shirts two or three pairs of stockings and a few collars I saw the door which leads to the leads of the house and found marks of blood on it - that door fastens with two bolts I did not find any knife in the room but I told the prisoner what the prosecutor had said about a knife and his answer was that he wished he had thrown away every d - d thing that was bloody I found the papers produced under the grate in the prisoner s bed-room not in the sitting room I found another paper folded up on the table in the sitting-room I looked for the knife on the roofs of the houses that day but could not find it for the snow I went again the next day and found the handle on the roof of No 34 and the blade on the roof of No 38 this is the knife - it is what is called a Spanish knife Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Was any body with you when you took the prisoner A Yes Mr Izard- I took him about four o clock in the afternoon as near as I can tell I believe no one had hold of him - he was up in his room and as I was informed by some one that he had a dagger I went home and provided myself with a cutlass and went back and took him MR LAW Q Have you examined the knife A Yes it is sharp on both sides - I saw the prosecutor had two wounds on his head and his clothes were very bloody JOSEPH BARBER I am a chemist and live at No 7 Orange-street Red Lion-square I was applied to for the prosecutor on the day of the transaction I found he had a wound on the top of his head another over his right eye and his hands were severely cut the wound on the top of his head was of a triangular form and there was a slight crack on the top of the skull - it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by this bat and I should think it was done by this round part of it - it was done by a blunt instrument the wound on the eye was a contused wound done apparently with the edge of the bat the cuts on the hand had been evidently produced by clasping some sharp instrument - they were just at the bend of the fingers in the left hand and the outside of the thumb of the right hand was cut also the wounds were such that a person grasping a blade might have received I dressed the prisoner s wounds afterwards - they were on the back part of his head and appeared to be caused by a fall I said to him How came you in such an affray as this he said It was merely a quarrel - he called my friend a humbug I saw the prosecutor s money - there was nearly 500l COURT Q Should you think the wounds on the prosecutor s hand were inflicted by his endeavouring to wrest the knife from the prisoner A I should think they were Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Were all the wounds on the prisoner such as you suppose were occasioned by a fall A Yes except one cut on his hand and a blow on the side of his head I bound up the prosecutor s wounds with proper bandages the wound over the eye was the worst I do not think there was any danger from either of the wounds - the wounds on the top of the head might have been dangerous had it been inflicted with a heavier instrument the wound on the back of the prisoner s head was from a severe blow but it did not present to me an appearance of having received three or four blows with a poker I however do not consider myself competent to decide that MR LAW Q Suppose a person to have hold of a cutting instrument in his left hand might he not by that means have been disabled in some measure from using his right hand A Yes JAMES DAVIS I am a surgeon I examined the prosecutor s wounds - they were on a part of the head wherethey might have been dangerous - the wound over the eye bled very much they were such as I would attribute rather to this bat than to a pugilistic contest Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Has it ever been in your experience to examine a person who has been in a pugilistic contest A Yes and I have found bleeding wounds from blows on the head in that case I do not consider that the prosecutor s life was ever in danger COURT Q Was the wound on the back of the head a contused wound A Yes the wound over the eye was an incised wound - it was a cleaner cut than the other - I should think it might have been inflicted with the edge of this bat there are different sorts of wounds what we call lacerated contused and incised wounds and some partaking of the nature of two of these wounds if I were speaking as a surgeon I should denominate the wound over the forehead as an incised wound there was very little contusion in that wound from there being more integuments over the eye I should call it an incised wound produced by some sharper instrument than that which inflicted the other wound or from the edge of that instrument the blunt part could not have made such a wound there was no swelling accompanying the wound on the eye and very little discolouration I saw the prosecutor the same evening and am still in attendance on him JOSEPH STEPHENS I found this ring in the front kitchen on the Friday following - I do not know whether Mr Mullay had been washing there or not The prisoner in an exceedingly long address to the Court stated that Owen and himself being in had circumstances had determined to answer the prosecutor s advertisement and persuade him to lodge a sum of money in a banker s hands in the joint names of Owen and the prosecutor s conceiving that Owen could then make the banker s a house of reference and by that means to obtain goods on credit to a considerable amount that he was appointed to conduct the negotiation He then entered into a minute detail of his several interviews with Mr Mullay who was willing to deposit the sum that on the day in question Mr Mullay called for the purpose of meeting Owen who did not fulfil his engagement that he had only placed the poker in the fire for the purpose of making it burn brighter Mr Mullay began to express his disappointment at Owen not coming and he advised his writing a note that he had bought the bat to present to his landlady s child in return for her attention to him when ill Mr Mullay at last displayed much anger at Owen s not arriving and stated that he was humbugged and the prisoner feeling irritated at such language struck him in the face with his fist Mr Mullay then seized the poker and the prisoner the bat when a scuffle ensued and both were alternately on the ground in the scuffle a knife was knocked off the mantel-shelf and the prisoner fearing Mr Mullay might seize it took it up himself the prosecutor gave him several violent blows on the head and body with the poker and supposing the prisoner might use the knife to defend himself called Murder during the scuffle the prisoner succeeded in breaking the knife against the wainscoat and put both blade and handle into his pocket The alarm having brought the neighbours up the prisoner observed to the prosecutor that it was necessary an explanation should be given as he had called murder to which he assented and the prisoner opened the door and the prosecutor stated to the persons assembled that they had been quarrelling He declared the only object he had was to have the money deposited at the banker s in order to make them his house of reference and appealed to the Court whether it was possible he could expect to overcome a person of the prosecutor s strength that he had only acted in self-defence and concluded by solemnly appealing to the Almighty for the truth of his statement GUILTY on the last count Aged 36 Transported for Life

COOPER I am a sergeant of the police establishment at Uxbridge Middlesex On the evening of Friday the 9th of March I was on duty there—I had occasion to see one Richard Pearce about a fortnight

the station-house before any thing was done—as I was going in at the gate Pearce put himself into a righting attitude and again used the expressions I have named—he was not more than six or seven feet from me—he was within reach of me if he had struck me— Latham was close behind him—close to him—he did not say any thing —I found it necessary as the peace was broken to lake Pearce into custody—there were fifty or sixty persons collected together in a mob—they had been followed by all the persons who were at the beer-shop and the mob collected as they came along—I took Pearce by the collar to take him into the station-house and immediately Latham hung himself right round Pearce as I suppose for the purpose of rescuing him from me—we gate a sudden pull and got them both inside the gate—they had both been drinking pretty freely and were labouring under the effects of drink—I got them both into the station-house and Fortnum shut the gate—the door of the station-house is not more than two or three yards from the gate—it is a small room we have for the purpose of taking the charges—I succeeded in getting Pearce and Latham into the charge-room—we have a strong-room eight or ten yards from the charge-room—Fortnum left after getting them into the charge-room—they were both in liquor and clinging to each other—when I got them into the room they both fell down on the floor and while there I and my wife kept them down as well as we could while Fortnum went to open the door of the strong-room—while I was endeavouring to keep them down Latham got himself round so as to get on one leg—he pat his arm round and took something from his pocket—there was a strong light in the room a fire and a candle—I saw something in his hand which appeared to me to be a table-knife—he made several thrusts at me—here is the great coat I had on— producing it —here are seven stabs in the coat in the part which covers my thigh and leg—there is one stab in the arm—I felt the knife go into my leg—I called out Oh the villain has stabbed me —Pearce who laid down in one part of the station-house hearing me say that called out That is right give it the b——r quite load Q Did you feel that you had received more than one wound at the time pearce called A No—the particular wound I felt was of a particular description—it went nearly through the calf of my leg—I have reason to recollect the moment I received it—I felt the knife enter the calf of my leg—after receiving this wound Latham got himself up on his legs in the charge-room—I stepped back off the step and he made another plunge at me—I drew my staff out and struck him on the side of his head—I got out into the yard and he followed me making thrusts at me as he followed —I discovered I had two wounds—I hardly know How many stabs I had before I used my staff—he followed and thrust at me—I struck him again with my staff in the yard and at that moment the station-house yard gate was burst open and a mob of persons entered—the first person I saw was the female prisoner Clements—at the time the gate was being opened my leg was bleeding—I felt the blood flowing from me—it was pouring over my boat—at that time I should think there were two hundred persons collected round the station-house—fifteen or twenty accompanied Clements as many as could crowd in at the gate—on her coming in she was close to me and Latham as we were close to the gate—I will not say that Clements could see the state of my leg—as she entered I and Latham were fighting—he was stabbing at me at the time and I was keeping him off—she saw us fighting and clapped her hands and called out Give it him give it the b——r —she turned round to the others and said Get out your knives we will give it to the b——r and such like expressions—the mob got both prisoners out of the yard—they caught hold of them and pulled them out of the gate—Pearce had got out of the house then—he had got into a cornet and was still calling out to Latham to give it to me but did not join in it himself—he was standing up in a corner not above two yards from me and Latham—I had got two men taking their rest before going on duty and Fortnum had gone to call them believing they would make an attack on a—a great number of the windows of the station-house were broken and we heard the stones fly up at the windows at least we heard the windows crack—I then went and saw my three men come down stairs—the prisoners at that time were gone—I suggested that we should go and take them—up to the time I used my staff to protect myself I had never spoken it Latham nor put a hand on him—I became exhausted from the wound—we had left our cutlasses exposed in the little room near the gate—I proposed to go back and secure the cutlasses and on going back the gate was again broken open and the female prisoner kept calling out Here they come—Get out your knives my boys let us give it to the b—n—I bad just pushed down the catch of the gate—the latch was broken of by their bursting it in COURT Q What happened when the woman called out what you have said A I was exhausted then—I found I had a stab in the calf of my left leg and one just in the inside of my left thigh—the wound is the thigh was about six inches above the knee—the wound on the calf of the leg appeared a very bad one—the other one did not enter my flesh very far and that is not a very bad wound—it appeared to be done with a sharp instrument—the one in the leg appeared to have been cut two ways as if when the knife got in it had turned round—I had two wounds—here is the part of my coat which came directly over my leg where the lower wound is—here are seven holes altogether and there is a cut in the right arm of my coat—that is included in the seven Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Who was present when you received the first stab A My wife was with me in the room holding Latham and Pearce down—I believe Fortnum was near the door having just returned from unlocking the strong room—the woman might have seen Latham s head bleeding—I will not venture to swear she did not see it—it was a bright moon-light night and there was a large fire in the station-house and a candle—I had never spoken to Latham in my life before—he had a cap which Fortnum has got—Latham was taken on the spot very soon after—Pearce had got away—my wife is here—I was in the Metropolitan police about six years ago—I retired from that and went into the country with an insane lady and when I returned I was recommended to this place—I resigned from the police of my own accord GEORGE WILLIAM FORTNUM I am one of the police-constables of Uxbridge On the evening of Friday the 9th of March I was with Cooper in Rockingham-place about half-past nine o clock—there is a beer-shop nearly opposite to where we were—I observed a vast crowd around the beer-shop—the prisoner Latham was much enraged holding his fist up wishing somebody to come out I believe whom he had been quarrelling with—I believe the persons were in liquor—I did not interfere with them nor did cooper—they made use of bad language and called us b—y police and b—y half-starved looking b—s—Pearce used bad language and said B—y police —neither I nor Cooper took any notice of him—we walked on towards the station-house followed by a number of persons—Pearce was foremost—I did not see Latham follow but he hung on Pearce when he was collared—Pearce used language respecting being caught in the barn—I saw Cooper collar Pearce and Latham hung on him—I aid not see Pearce do any thing to Cooper before Cooper took hold of him—when I got to the station-house Cooper endeavoured to pull Pearce in and Latham hung on him—we succeeded in getting them both into the yard and shut the gate—we got them into the charge-room—there was a great struggle between Pearce and Sergeant Cooper and Latham—Pearce was on the ground flat on his face and Latham on the top of him—there is a strong-room near the spot—I went to open it by the desire of my sergeant to get the prisoners in—after I returned from the strong-room I was Latham on one knee making two distinct stabs as it were at Cooper who said I am stabbed run and get the men up —I did not hear what passed from Pearce when the sergeant said I am stabbed —but I heard Latham when he stabbed him say Take that you b—r —I went for the policemen who were resting to take their turn at twelve o clock at night—Latham and Pearce had got away when I returned from calling the men and I found the gate of the station-house yard had been burst open—I did not see the female prisoner till she was brought in in custody—I did not hear what passed with her—while Latham was in the charge-room after hearing a cry that the man was stabbed I saw something shine in Latham s hand—I cannot say what it was JAMES DARVILL I am constable of Uxbridge I was in the town on this Friday evening about half-past nine o clock and saw a disturbance at the station-house—I went towards it and found about a hundred or more persons about the gate—I saw the female prisoner there—she was against Pearce and several more trying to burst the gate open—five or six of them were rushing against it at once—I pushed her away—she went into the road—I pushed Pearce from the gate and I saw her throw some stones three times—I heard her say I hope the b—r is dead —I saw Pearce and Latham both—Latham was a little on the other side—Pearce was with her—Latham was seven or eight yards from the other two—I did not hear Latham say any thing at that time—it might be a quarter of an hour after—I did not come there till after they had got out of the station-house Cross-examined Q When you saw Latham was he bleeding A Yes a great deal from the head GEORGE AUSTIN I am a baker living at Uxbridge I was in the station-house about half-past nine o clock on Friday evening the 9th of March—I observed a congregation of people and the prisoners in remarkable manner among them—by their manner of acting they evinced themselves as the chief conductors of a riot—the woman was urging on a number of people to do mischief and the male prisoner was acted upon by her in an especial manner—I did not hear her say any thing because I am deaf but I saw enough to convince me she was the ringleader of the disturbance—I imagine there were a hundred people there—I did not observe any thing in Latham s hand but I saw it in an attitude which made me conclude there was something in it—he was in the attitude of striking a blow at some one unperceived by me behind the gate—I heard him say God strike me b—y dead I will stab him —I afterwards went to the station-house—this was opposite the station-house—I went for Mr Patten the surgeon Cross-examined Q Are you any thing besides a baker A I am a baker by profession—I include the business of corn-dealer—a baker is my ostensible business—I have no extra business—I do not hold forth my where—at the time I speak of Latham was bleeding—I did not notice whether it was a great deal—I remarked a disfiguration on his head MARY GRENVILLE I am the wife of Joseph Grenville a brazier living at Uxbridge I was near the station-house on Friday night the 9th of March—I saw the female prisoner in the street by the station-house about three yards from the gate—she and two more were jumping at the gate to break it open—I saw the male prisoner come out at the gate—Clements patted him on the back and another but I did not observe the other—she said You b—r I have pluck enough to release the whole of you —she tucked up the sleeves of her gown and challenged to fight anybody Cross-examined Q What are you A The wife of John Grenvile—it was when they came out that she patted Latham on the back SOPHIA GROOM I am the wife of Edward Groom of Uxbridge On this Friday night I was disturbed by a noise at the station-house—I got up went towards the place and saw Latham among other persons there—I observed where he stood and in the course of the evening I found a knife about half a yard from where he was standing—I gave it to my husband—Murray called at my house the next morning and I delivered the knife to him CHARLES JAMES MURRAY I am a constable of Uxbridge I produce knife which I received from Mrs Groom on Saturday morning the 10th of March—I observed blood on the handle of it Cross-examined Q None on the blade A None—I have kept it ever since—I saw Latham standing not far from the gate—he told me he had been knocked or chopped down—he was bleeding very much—I left him there—I then went to the station-house and understood the policeman had been stabbed—I went back and found Latham standing in the same place as I had left him—he appeared very weak from the loss of blood CHARLES PATTEN I am a surgeon and live at Uxbridge On Friday evening the 9th of March I was called in to see sergeant Cooper—I went to the station-house—he had received a deep punctured wound in the fleshy part of the left leg and a very slight wound in the thigh of the same side—the wound in the leg was a very deep wound and appeared to be made in two directions—a triangular wound—it was extremely dangerous attended with a great deal of haemorrhage—the knife produced is precisely the kind of instrument that would have inflicted the wound—it appears like a half-worn-out oyster knife Cross-examined Q Did you examine Latham A I did—I dressed wound and had part of the hair shaved away to apply a plaster to it MR CLARKSON Q Was it such a wound as a man might have inflicted with a constable s staff A Very likely John Stevens a shoemaker of Uxbridge and Mary Brown of Uxbridge gave the prisoner Latham a good character LATHAM— GUILTY Aged 19 — Transported for Fifteen Years CLEMENTS— NOT GUILTY 
t18380514-1350  1350 JOHN MAGUIRE was indicted for feloniously assaulting Patrick Hagerty on the 21st of April at Saint Marylebone and unlawfully cutting and wounding him upon his head with intent to maim and disable him —2nd COUNT stating his intent to be to do him some grievous bodily harm —3rd COUNT to resist and prevent his lawful apprehension and detainer PATRICK HAGERTY police-constable D 103 On the morning of the 21st of April about one o clock I was on duty in the Edgeware-road—I saw the prisoner in company with two females whom I knew to be prostitutes—the prisoner had a bundle and a shovel under one of his arms I cannot say which and his other arm was round one of the females—I went up to the prisoner and asked him what he had in the bundle—I was in my dress as a policeman and had my cape on at the time—the prisoner asked me what business I had with him—I told him I wished to see what the bundle contained—he refused to let me see—I said if he did not I would bring him to the station-house—I stepped up before him and he instantly dropped the bundle and took the shovel up struck me on the head with the blade of it and cut my head— I had not touched him at that time —it was not very much of a blow my hat prevented it from taking full effect—my hat dropped off at the time and the prisoner came up with the shovel and made a second attempt to strike me over the head but I stepped back a few yards and missing his blow he came right down on the pavement with the blade of the shovel which turned the edge of it—he was coming up with a third attempt with the shovel raised in his hand when a constable from the adjoining beat came over with his staff drawn and struck him between the two shoulders which took no effect—it did not stop him—he turned round and struck the other constable with the shovel on the hat—he drove the corner right through the crown of his hat and made a hole through but it did not hit him—he then raised the shovel and struck at the other constable again but he missed his blow—the constable stepped back a few yards and when the prisoner saw he had missed his blow he ran away—I brought the bundle to the station-house and examined it—it contained the property claimed by a person here present—there were in it five trowels and one flannel jacket—they were wrapped round with a handkerchief—I knew the prisoner—I had seen him in custody before—he was apprehended in about three-quarters of an hour asleep in some house but I was not there—I saw him in about fifty minutes in Harcourt-street station-house which is about three minutes walk from the place where this happened Prisoner I told him to come to my lodging and see what was in the bundle Witness Yes I believe he did but I understood he had no lodging in particular COURT Q How did you know that A In consequence of his being taken often times lying out in out-houses—I think the prisoner was not sober—he kept the shovel all the time—I did not get that—he went off with it and had it with him when he was taken WILLIAM GLASSCOCK police-constable 7 61 I was on duty on the opposite side of the Edgeware-road about five minutes after one o clock on the morning of the 21st of April—I was coming from the Harrow-road in the direction of Chapel-street—I saw several persons standing at the corner of Chapel-street but I did not know who they were or what they were—all at once I saw a scuffle take place from the pavement into the middle of the road—I saw the prisoner and the constable go from the pavement into the middle of the road—I heard something drop which proved to be these trowels—I then saw the prisoner with the shovel raised and my brother constable was singing out for help—I ran across the road—the prisoner struck the shovel on the ground before I got over—he was then lifting it up again when I struck him between the two shoulders but the blow not taking the effect which I intended he immediately turned round to me and struck me a violent blow with the shovel on the hat which stunned me and my hat fell off but I did not fall—I was about to come up at him again when I saw he had got the shovel again raised and was coming at me and I found that if I advanced any further my head would have been severed in two my hat being off at the time—he found that I retreated back and he then made his escape—he ran down Burns -place—I was unacquainted with that place and it being dark I sprung my rattle but did not then overtake the prisoner—I saw him in about an hour afterwards at Harcourt-street station-house—another officer who is here took him ARTHUR GORE police-constable D 120 I was on duty about a quarter to two o clock on the morning of the 21st of April in Charles-street Lisson-grove—one of my brother constables came to me and gave me information of what the prisoner had committed—a woman came up in the meantime and said she was afraid to go to her lodging at No 7 Charles-street Lisson-grove at there was a person asleep in the house—I in consequence went to that house and found the prisoner asleep on the landing of the first floor with this shovel by his side—knowing him to be a most violent character I took the shovel away and let him remain as I knew I should be unable to make a prisoner of him by myself—I went and procured the assistance of two other constables and we then took him to Harcourt-street station-house—on his way to the station-house be acknowledged the shovel to be his and also at the station-house—he was sober then but I rather suspect he had been drinking previously WILLIAM POUNCT I live in Little Carlisle-street and am a plasterer I was at work at a new house in Somers-street and left work at half-put five o clock on the night of the 20th of April—I gave my four trowels to the boy to clean which he did and put them into the pail which was left in the fire-place on the second floor—there was only a temporary door to the house which was put up for the occasion and it was fastened by a piece of wood falling against it inside—these four trowels now produced are the same as I lost that night—the prisoner had no business on those premises that I know of—he bad no authority from me to take these trowels—they are worth 6s JOHN DAVIS I am a plasterer I was working at the same house as the last witness I lost one trowel out of the same pall on the same night—I have no knowledge of the prisoner—he had nothing to do with these premises GERALD MURPHT I live in Nightingale-street Lisson-grove This shovel is my property—I put it into the house No 20 Somers-street where the plasterers were working and I lost it from the first-floor the tame night that they lost their trowels WILLIAM PARISH I live in Cumberland-market and am a plasterer This is my flannel jacket—I lost it from the same house on the same night Prisoner s Defence I do not know how I came by the tools at all—I was very tipsy—I was coming from my work when I had them PATRICK HAOERTY re-examined Q Describe a little more fully what was the effect of the blow you received A If my hat had not been on it would have cut my head open—it was not very violent—my head was cut open—I went to the doctor the next morning and got a bit of sticking plaster to keep my hat from it—the skin of my bead was cut through—the wound was not much—it was a little round spot GUILTY Aged 20 — Transported for Fifteen Years

in Norland-place near Nottinghill Kensington On Saturday the 21st of July I went out to take a walk with two of my children a little girl rather more than nine and a boy rather more than ten-as I returned I came down a lane at the back of Lord Holland s park—on coming to a turning leading into Camden-road I saw a man sitting on a basket—he could look down the lane and see into the Camden-road—after passing him I got to a bend in the lane some distance further up—I was conversing with the little girl on my right and on raising my head I first saw the prisoner close to me standing with his face to me-his hands were apparently down—I did not notice any thing in his hand at the moment—the moment he discovered that I saw him he placed himself before me and said Your money sir —he had two pistols one in each hand—I was fearful if he fired he might kill the children and said Money no indeed —I pushed the children away on one side and sprang forward and tried to disarm him-and he fired the pistol in his left hand-as I sprang at him I felt the ball strike me a tremendous blow and felt I was wounded before I reached his right hand and grasped the other pistol—I was wounded in the upper part of the right thigh—I still went towards him and succeeded in getting the other pistol from his right hand—I presented it at his head and then he tore from me—we had rather a sharp struggle and on my putting the pistol to his head he ran away directly towards where the man was sitting—I called out Stop him —the man took up his basket and ran away in the same direction as the prisoner did—I saw the prisoner in custody in about ten minutes after and identified him immediately—I am certain it was him—I attempted to discharge the pistol I took from him as he was running

him but did not succeed—he put it in his right-hand pocket—I then secured him with the pistol in his pocket—the under-gardener came to my assistance shortly after and when the pistol was taken from his pocket it was unloaded—I cannot say whether it had been recently discharged—I saw the prosecutor in the course of five or six minutes and he identified him as the man—it was the prisoner ROBERT WHITE I am a policeman I was called to take the prisoner into custody—I found him in the station-house with the prosecutor and last witness—I searched him-a pistol was given me by each witness—the one

public-house—we had four pots of beer each paid for two—he said during the time he was drinking if he had known I had been going on furlough so soon he would have given me a sovereign to go on

pockets and made the best of their way to the Black Boy at Greenwich and staid there till very early next morning and the prisoner Perceval and two more marines went to London to sport with the

have not had any quarrel with the prisoner—I do not belong to the same mess with him—I did once but did not at the time of the robbery—when he paid for the porter at the Duchess of Wellington I saw him take a little bag out of his pocket and when he took the money out he said This is some of the money I had of him it is not half spent yet —he treated me with two pots of ale after he paid for the two pots of porter COURT I believe before you told this you had been sent for about a pair of stockings which had been stolen A Yes—they were stolen out of No 3 mess—I was asked about that I was not

same as I have told you to-day JAMES WATTS I am high-constable of Woolwich I saw the prisoner in the cage after he had been before the Justice on this charge—I made a memorandum at the time of what he said—I told him I was bound to take down in writing whatever he said to me as it was probable it might be brought before him at another period and be given in evidence—I made him no promise or threat whatever—it came out in this way—he said Will you have the goodness to inform Sir John Webb who is a Magistrate that I am innocent of the charge and I will tell you all about it — referring to his memorandum —he said I was walking on the road to meet a female and the first person I met was a man with a bag across his shoulders—I went a little further and saw the gentleman lying on the road and Norton with his arm on the gentleman s shoulder and his hand appeared over his mouth—he drew his head with an inclination for me to go away which I did—he came up and gave me part of the money—I afterwards met Perceval at the dock-yard gate and we both went to Greenwich—Norton could tell that the man who died in the hospital was with him when he robbed the gentleman—I am sure Norton will not contradict what I have here stated —I took that down from his own lips Prisoner Yes I told Mr Watts so in the cage JOHN DRAKE FINCH I am clerk to the Justices at Woolwich I remember a marine named

and there we remained all night—no one but Perceval and I went in—we met some comrades there—I am quite certain I did not leave the barracks with Perceval at six o clock—I am sure Best did not go into the Black Boy with us—I am sure Perceval and I did not go half-way up the fair or in it at all—on Thursday we went to London—we walked—I had half-a-crown—I don t know what Perceval had This deposition was taken on the 15th of June when Perceval was in custody—he was afterwards discharged—on the 14th of December the prisoner was himself brought before the Justice on this charge—the Magistrate then directed the deposition which he had previously made and which I have just read to be read over to him and I made a note upon ft of what the prisoner then said which is The said Thomas Baker declares that he does not recollect what he then stated —I should state that the latter part of the deposition just read were answers to questions put by the Magistrates in consequence of Perceval s previous statement—and the last four or five questions were put by the Magistrate to contradict Perceval—on the 14th of December when the prisoner was charged with this offence he was asked what he had to say and I took down from his mouth what he said—this is the statement he made— looking at it —after it was taken down I read it over to him and he put his mark to it—he was cautioned by the Magistrate as well as by myself not to say a single word to criminate himself nothing was said to him in the way of promise—there were two or three Justices present— read — Thomas Baker says—I was going on Eltham-road on Greenwich Fair night to meet a young woman and I went to the side of the road to ease myself and during the time I was easing myself a man passed along the road—he appeared as if he had a bag on his back—he did not speak to me nor I to him—I went on the road and when I came down by the side of the road I saw something lay by the side of the road which I walked up to—I could see it was some marines with waist belts on—one of the men I directly knew at the time I stepped up and he throwed his head to me to go back—I did not go back and weat down on my hands and knees and looked in on the men—and I say another man right over the man s hips and I saw it was Norton and the other man I did not know—I got up and went and Norton came and ran after me after I had got some distance and offered me some money which I took and I asked him what it was for and I told him it was not his money and that I should have nothing at all to do with it—he took it and asked me what I was afraid of and he gave me some silver and said it was some money his father and mother had given him to buy some things with—on the Lower-road of Greenwich I met Perceval and him and me went to Greenwich

struck him again—Wilson turned round in his own defence and struck at the prisoner but did not hit him as he stood a little way from him—they sparred and Wilson was knocked down several times by the prisoner—Wilson was defending himself then as well as he could—he was knocked down by the blows of the prisoner alone—Wilson was stripped—he had nothing but his shirt on and the wrist was doubled over his hands—he pulled his shirt off after that and the prisoner was standing by the table as if he was feeling for something—Wilson went up and struck the prisoner who was stooping at the table—I cannot say where Wilson struck him but he hit him and the prisoner returned the blow with a knife in the left breast—I saw him draw the knife from a sheath at his side and strike him on the left breast—he then threw the knife out of his hand on the floor and resumed the fight with Wilson as if nothing had happened—I immediately took up the knife and showed it to the company standing round the room—I ran to Wilson and grasped his wound where the blood was flowing from him in torrents—he did not know he was stabbed at first—he fought one round after he was stabbed and was knocked down over a bench by somebody I do not know who but two more of the prisoner s shipmates were before the Magistrate and discharged—I stopped the blood as well as I could—he told me he was not stabbed chucked my hand away from the wound and told me to let him go that he was a dead man that he should die by him—I told him he would recover—I took him down to the bar—Howard the policeman was coming up the passage and I gave the knife to him—the blade was covered with blood half way up—somebody went for a doctor who refused to come—Mr Gurney came in about a quarter of an hour—Wilson was in a very weak state—he seemed to know what was going on—I held the wound to stop the blood till Mr Gurney came Prisoner Q Did you see roe have a knife A Yes I saw you draw it from the sheath at your side—it hung by a belt at your side—you had not your coat on at the time—you threw your coat down in the tap-room—you were in your shirt-sleeves—you dropped the belt down behind the bench—you had the belt round your waist round your trowsers inside your coat—you had a pilot coat which you threw off—Wilson had not a coat on—he came in in a red shirt without any coat on—he had a waistcoat on Prisoner The prosecutor said the quarrel was about his coat Witness I understand that happened on board ship before he came there—the prisoner had been drinking but knew perfectly well what he was about—Wilson appeared perfectly sober and knew what he was about—the prisoner had the advantage during the fight till the latter end JAMES HOWARD I am a policeman I was fetched to the Hope and Anchor about eight o clock in the evening—I was close to the house at the time—I asked Smith for a knife which he gave me—it was all over blood and wet at the time—I produce it—I have had it ever since—I went up into the tap-room and took the prisoner—I told him he was my prisoner and must go with me—he said Very well I will go and went very quietly—I got this belt and sheath from M Donald—the prisoner had been drinking but was not drunk—he knew what he was about—he walked very well ANGUS M DONALD I was in the room when this happened—I did not see any body draw a knife nor see it in any body s hand till I saw it in the possession of Smith after the prosecutor was stabbed—I picked up a belt and sheath on the opposite side of the room to where the prisoner stood about three minutes after the prosecutor was stabbed—I had not observed whether the prisoner had such a belt on—I saw the prisoner strike Wilson a blow and at that very instant a noise came as if water was gushing out—I looked at Wilson and saw the blood coming from him—the prisoner resumed the fight as if nothing had happened—Wilson was standing in his own defence—I had observed the prisoner stooping and feeling about his trowsers with both hands immediately before this blow was given—there was a meeting between them and I heard the blood ooze like water—whether it was a knife or not I cannot tell—it must have been the blow I saw that caused the oozing of blood Prisoner Q Had Wilson a coat an when he came in A I did not see him enter the tap-room THOMAS CUMMINS I am a policeman I was with Howard and took the prisoner to the station-house—several people accused him of stabbing the man on the road—he denied it saying he had no knife nor belt—this was both going along and in the house too—he afterwards said he did not stab him he knew who did stab him and said I will be d—d if I will tell —he had been drinking but knew what he was about JOHN GURNEY I am a surgeon I was called into the Hope and Anchor about half-past eight o clock in the evening and found the prosecutor—a good deal of bleeding had taken place from a wound about an inch and a half below the collar bone between the first and second ribs—the wound was about two inches extending obliquely upwards towards the wind pipe—it was about half an inch deep—I closed the wound and stopped the blood—he was rather low and exhausted from the previous loss of blood—it was certainly a dangerous wound as the upper lobe of the left lung was slightly injured—he expectorated blood—if it had been a little lower and passed between the ribs it would have penetrated the lungs and the large vessels of the heart and death would have immediately followed —this knife is an instrument likely to have done it—I have no doubt the blow was struck with force from the nature of the wound—the man must have been in a stooping attitude at the time which prevented it going further—the rib prevented it from entering further JAMES THOMPSON I am a surgeon I saw the wound—in my judgment it was rather of a dangerous nature—it the knife had passed deeper or the pointed side downwards it would have caused death instantly—he is nearly well now Prisoner s Defence My shipmates and I came ashore and drank all day together as we were to sail next morning—I saw one of his shipmates who had been with us to New York—he had left his clothes in our vessel which I took care of thinking he would come home in the next ship and he did—I did not have all his things right—there was a coat one of my shipmates had taken on the passage which I did not know of and when he came on board for his clothes he asked if they were all right—I said Yes I believed it was all correct—he said there was a bag of clothes besides his chest—I had not seen it but I found the bag and his clothes with one of my shipmates who it seems had cut about six inches off the coat tail to disguise it—I told the man to say nothing about it as he had got his coat and he said he would not—we came into the Anchor and Hope and as we came in Wilson was standing in the passage and said I should like to see some of the crew that cut my coat tail —I said it was not me I am not the man that cut it and then it commenced—it was the first scrape I was ever in—he struck me or I should not have offered to strike him—I have suffered enough for my conduct since—if I had not been in liquor I should have kept clear from fighting—directly I saw the knife I knew it belonged to Reeve a shipmate of mine who was in the room at the time but sailed in the ship next morning—one more of my shipmates was taken and one of the prosecutor s shipmates—the ship sailed next morning and left me destitute of every thing—I am an American and a stranger JOHN SMITH re-examined I saw him draw the knife from the sheath on his right side GUILTY on the 3rd Count Aged 27 —Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutor — Transported for Fifteen Years Before Mr Justice Vaughan 
t18390408-1320  1320 RICHARD WHITING was indicted for unlawfully maliciously and feloniously assaulting Elizabeth Whiting on the 6th of March at Edmonton and cutting and wounding her on her neck and throat with intent to murder her —2nd COUNT stating his intent to be to maim and disable her —3rd COUNT to do her some grievous bodily harm MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution ELIZABETH WHITING I am the prisoner s wife I was married to him on the 11th of February—I had only known him two months before—I became acquainted with him casually as I was going to Gracechurch-street alter a situation—I understood from him that he was going to Australia and he told me he could not go unless he was married—in consequence of what passed between us I did not go to Gracechurch-street but returned with him—I was then living with Mrs Jones a laundress at Southgate where I found he lived— I was brought up in an Orphan Asylum —I continued to see him from time to time down to the period of our marriage—the day before we were married I told him if he had heard any reports about my character I would decline marrying him—he said No he did not believe what he had heard—it was reported that I had been unfortunate—that was true but it was better than three years ago—I am now nineteen years old—I was living in a family as servant at the time it happened—we were married the day after this conversation—I went at first with him to London for a short time and then came back and lived at his father s for about three weeks—some unpleasantness arose between us rather better than a week after our marriage after our return to Southgate—it was one Sunday—I had got his breakfast and all things prepared to go to church—he refused to go with me and I went with his father—he did not give any reason for that—one evening about a week before this attack was made on me his brother William who lived in the house was talking rather familiarly to me and Richard knocked my head and his together—that did not appear to be done at all in anger—he usually went to bed before me and did so that night—I did not find the door fastened when I went up—no quarrel or any thing happened that night—on one occasion his brother William attempted to kiss me in his presence—I did not find the bed-room door locked that night when I went to bed—I did about a week before when no quarrel had happened—I waited at the door about a quarter of an hour and he let me in—I was angry at not being let in and did not undress myself—I was not very long in the room before I undressed—he requested me to undress and I did—he then prevented me getting into bed and said I had stopped out for my own pleasure and I should now stop out for his—I stopped out for nearly three hours—he then fell asleep and I got into bed—in the course of that night he swore at me several times which was a very unusual thing—he told me to get further and not come near him in the bed—he did nothing to me that night—he told me one morning about a week before this happened that I liked his brother William better than I did him and he pinched me severely—we were in bed at the time—we had no quarrel on Wednesday morning the 6th of March—I was on very good terms with him on the Tuesday—he asked me for sixpence for drink that day being thirsty as he had taken a little too much the day before and I gave it to him—he got the drink out of doors—he came home at his regular time between six and seven o clock in the evening—he went to bed about ten o clock that night—I did not go till about eleven o clock as I was in conversation with his father and mother—when I went up to bed he was awake—he did not speak to me—I think he remained awake—he was very restless all night and swore and called me bad names—he called me a b—h several times—he did not give me any reason for addressing me in that way—I awoke before seven o clock in the morning—he was then dressing himself—I had heard his brother Charles call him—I was awake then and when he got up and was dressing himself—I rather think he did not put his shoes on—I did not see that but thought so by his walking so lightly—he then left the room for a very few minutes—it was a quarter or twenty minutes to seven o clock when he was called and it was striking seven o clock when he returned—I was then lying almost in the middle of the bed—on entering the room he came to the left side of the bed which was nearest to him—I usually laid on the right side Q As you lay in bed on your back was he on your right or left side A My left—he left the door open—he came to the left side of the bed sat on the bed put his hands on my neck and said Are not my hands very cold —I said Yes they are —he said I will move them —I said No you need not move them —he then moved his right hand to my right shoulder and put his left hand on the pillow—I did not notice whether he had any thing in either of his hands—he told me to shut my eyes and open my mouth and he had something good for me—I told him no I did not like to shut my eyes and open my month for I did not know what he would put in it—he said it was something very good—I thought this jocular—I did not feel quite satisfied with what he said and looked towards his left hand which was on the pillow—he said No it is not in my hand it is in my pocket —it must have been his right hand I looked at because the other he had previously put behind my shoulder—his hand on the pillow was not on the same side as the hand which was behind me—I was lying between his two hands—it must have been his left hand—my night-cap was off at the time lying on the bed—he told me he would come round to the other side of the bed and give it to me—he walked round to the other side and told me again to shut my eyes and open my mouth—I did so—he took my night-cap off the bed and pot it over my eyes with his left hand and kept it there and while the night-cap was over my eyes I felt my throat cut—I put my left hand up to my throat to try to prevent it and he cut two of my fingers the fourth and middle ones—I struggled and got the night-cap from my eyes—I did not see the instrument but I saw the prisoner there—I rather think I felt the knife with my hands when I was struggling—I am not quite sure whether I took hold of it or whether he dropped it—he then left the room tying You did it yourself —I got out of bed and went to the room door but was not able to open it—I cannot tell whether it was fastened—I went to the window opened it and called out Murder —I noticed his brother William outside in a gentleman s premises opposite—I then succeeded in getting out of the room—the door opened very easily when I went to it a second time—I went down stairs to the lower room which was opened to me by a little boy—I saw the prisoner as I went down stain at the back door leading into the garden in the way to the privy—I did not pass him—he was at some little distance—after going into the lower room I saw him at the window—he looked in at me from the outside—he then came and knocked at the door saying he wanted his boots and if he was not admitted he would burst the door open—I did not open the door—his brother William was in the room at the time and he gave him his boots—he did not come into the room while I was there—there is another door to the room besides the one he knocked at the front-door that was wide open—he said no thing more about what he had done in my presence—I was attended by a surgeon Cross-examined by MR JONES Q You had been married about a month when this happened A About three weeks—the prisoner did not behave kindly to me—he had severely pinched me previous to this but in any thing else he was very kind—he did generally behave kindly to me—I am quite sure he mentioned about going to Australia before we were married—I had objected to go—I said I would not go—he said he was determined to go—I was determined not to go with him—I was unhappy about leaving my own country—I objected greatly to go when I saw how he ill-treated me—he severely pinched me and I told him if he treated me so in his father s house how would he do in a country where I was not known—I do not recollect saying I would rather die in this country than go to another—I will not swear I did not say so—I have seen the knife with which my throat was cut— produced —it is a table knife not a clasp knife—I had asked the prisoner s brother about a week before this to sharpen a table knife for me—I do not believe this is the knife—it was a knife with a round handle and I did not observe any gaps in it as I told the Magistrate—the brother did sharpen it—it had a white handle—I would not swear there were not gaps in that knife—I am quite sure it had not a square handle like this—that knife is not here—I have not looked for it since this occurrence—it was not produced before the Magistrate—this one was and I said I could not swear as to the gaps in it—the first person I saw besides my husband when I went down stairs was his little brother Joseph—I said nothing to him—I did to his brother William—I did not say Good God see what I have done to myself—I will swear I never said so to William or any of his brothers—I said Did you ever think I should come to this —when I looked out of the window I saw William in the opposite premises—I saw a brother younger than him down stain—I think William could have heard me very distinctly call murder—I said to Joseph Fetch a doctor for Richard has cut my throat —I solemnly swear I never said to William that I had done it myself or any thing of the kind—I was very much agitated and frightened but I knew perfectly well what I said Q What time had passed between your discovering your throat was cut taking the night cap from your eyes and going to the window and making an alarm A Almost instantly directly I came from the door—it was nothing like ten minutes—it was the inside of my fingers that was cut——my husband was taken into custody in the house—I cannot say how long after it happened for I was carried up stairs—he never entered the house while I was there—he did not express any wish to come and see me he merely wanted his boots—I would not have him admitted because I was afraid of him—I was put into the same bed again—the bed-clothes were quite close up to my person at the time this was done—it was a white counter-pane—I saw the knife while I was down stairs—it was brought down by the younger brother who went up to fetch a blanket as he could not find a shawl to wrap me in—I heard inquiries made in the course of the week for the knife which I had had sharpened and a knife was missing—I cannot say whether it was missing almost directly after William had sharpened it for me—it was mentioned the same week and it might be soon after—w had gone to bed on Tuesday night without having had any words or any quarrel—he had not been drinking much in the course of that day—he had had a little—he had the money from me but he was quite sober—he swore at me several times in the night and called me several names—he was awake when I went up—he did not complain of my disturbing him or appear angry—he gave no reason for swearing at me in the night—I remember Mrs Leversege coming into the room while I was down stairs—she came into the bed-room afterwards—I do not remember her saying to me It is very odd if your husband did this while you were in bed that there should be no blood on the quilt or bed clothes —I rather think there was blood on the sheet—I do not remember her saying any thing of the sort—I cannot say she did not—I know there was blood on the sheet for instantly I felt my throat cut I threw the clothes down and got out of bed—I was not there when the knife was found—I could not tell whether I felt the knife or not in the bed COURT Q Had you any clothes on when you got out of bed and went down A Only my night clothes MR BODKIN Q You got out of bed immediately the cut was inflicted A Immediately as soon as possible—I had gone to bed with both my stockings on as my feet were very cold but in the night the stocking on my right foot came off—I had the other one on when I got out of bed and that stocking had blood on it—I had asked his brother to sharpen a knife as I expected my husband and I were going off to Australia— I had said I would not go but he said he would use me well and I intended to go —I had a collar to rip off a shirt for him—my scissors were up stairs and I said William I won t trouble you to go up stairs be kind enough to sharpen me a knife —I got a knife with a narrow point and round handle—I said Sharpen that at the point only about half an inch round or it will cut where I do not want it —he did it and I used it for that purpose and other purposes as well—I am not sure whether I put it into the drawer or on the table after using it—I had taken it from the drawer from other knives—I selected it as it had a narrow point and suited my purpose best—I never took it up stairs to my bed-room for any purpose whatever—I swear that is not the knife for the handle was round Q Now upon the solemn oath you have taken did you procure that knife with any view or intent to inflict any injury on yourself or any body else A No it never entered my thoughts MR JONES Q When you and your husband talked about going to Australia and you refused to go did you say if he went you would leave Southgate and nobody should ever see you again A No I did not nor any thing of the kind COURT Q You say your husband called you names on Tuesday night which was quite unusual and seemed restless A Yes we did not come to friendly terms or make it up—he kept it up all night—I was not awake all night but every time I awoke he told me to get further—I said nothing to him I only told him he was very restless and would he like my place—he told me no JOSEPH WHITING I am the prisoner s brother and am ten years old—I live with my father On this Wednesday morning about seven o clock as I was in bed I heard a cry of Mother as I thought two or three times—I could not make out who it was—I got out of bed and ran down stairs stark naked looked out at the front door which was open and saw my sister-in-law Elizabeth at her bed-room window with her neck bleeding—she told me to run for the doctor—I sent my brother Edward and told her Edward was going—I went up stairs put on some of my clothes—I brought some down and put them on down stairs—I went into the lower room and fastened the door to keep the wind out—Elizabeth came and knocked at the door and I let her in—other persons came into the room—I was told to go up stairs to fetch her shawl—I went and looked about the bed but could not find it—I looked into the bed and found this knife in the bed with the blanket covered over it—there was blood upon it—I took it down stairs and showed it to my mother—I took it and put it into the pantry by her directions—Alder the policeman came and told me to fetch it and I did so Cross-examined Q Was the knife on the under sheet A It was in the bed and a blanket covered over it—the blanket was in its right place turned up—the prisoner was not in the house all the time—I do not know where he was—I do not remember his coming down stairs that morning before his wife—I saw his wife first that morning—she did not say to me Good God see what I have done to myself —she said Your brother Richard has cut my throat —she said that when I let her in at the door—I did not hear her say at any time that day that she had done it herself—I did not hear her say Who would ever have thought it would hare come to this —Richard was taken up at my father s house—he had staid there all the time—he was not in doors—he would not come in before Elisabeth was carried up stairs—he came in afterwards and was taken up—he got his living by working with a mud-cart—I do not know whether he had been drinking in the course of that week—I saw him often—he used to come in to dinner and supper—I do not know whether he had drank more than usual that week JOSEPH ALDER I am a policeman I took the prisoner into custody between seven and eight o clock on the morning this happened in the lower room at his father s house—I examined his dress but did not find the least trace of blood about him—I told him what I took him for—as we were going to the station-house he began to cry—I asked him what he was crying for—he said If she dies I shall be hung —I said Pooh nonsense —he said If she says I done it I shall —he said she had done it herself not at that moment but afterwards and said they had been uncomfortable for the last week or so—this was not all said at once but at intervals as we went along—it was nearly three miles to the station-house—I produce the knife which I received from Joseph Whiting Cross-examined Q Did he give you any reason for being uncomfortable during the week A Yes on account of people talking about her and jeering—he did not say it was because she would not go with him to Australia—he said they were going CHARLES WILKINSON I am a surgeon at Southgate I was called on Wednesday morning the 6th of March to go to the house where the prosecutrix was—I found her in the lower room sitting by the fire—she was severely wounded in the lower part of the throat—I examined the wound—it was about four inches and a half in length and full an inch in depth or rather better—it is quite healed now—as far as I could judge I should say the blade of the knife had gone downwards—had it gone upwards I think it must have been fatal—I think this knife would have produced such a wound—no very large arteries or vessels were separated—the wound was deepest in the centre—the blade of the knife appeared to have been turned more downwards than upwards and it was lower down in the neck than I have ever seen a wound in the throat—it was down-wards because there was a flap below—occasionally at the first cutting of a wound like that much blood will flow but sometimes it will not flow instanter—I found her very bloody when I got there—I ordered her to be put to bed and dressed the wound—I found two of her fingers were cut—one the third finger very slightly—the other the second was much deeper but not to any great extent—they were in a slanting direction—I should say they had both been cut with the same stroke—the wound in the throat was a serious one at the time—she kept her bed for a fortnight or better and was laid up from three weeks to a month—I sewed it up—she got up occasionally in the day time but did not leave her room—the wound was very near the carotid artery and the jugular vein—if either of those arteries had been severed death would have ensued most likely before she could have got assistance—my attention was not directed to her fingers by herself in the first instance but when I was washing her hand she complained of her fingers not before—she gave me an account of what had happened to her Cross-examined Q Was the prisoner present then A No—the large vessels were not injured—the wound would not be likely to produce death having missed the large vessels—from the nature of the wound the blade must have been drawn nearly straight across from left to right—the blade went downwards—it appeared to have entered on the left and come out on the right Q Suppose two wounds one drawn from right to left and the other from left to right what would be the difference in the appearance A Why the deepest part would have gone where it first entered Q Would it not be possible for such a wound to be made by drawing it the other way A It is possible but I do not think it probable—it is a matter of opinion JURY Q But did you not say this wound was deepest in the centre A Yes MR JONES Q How do you reconcile the wound being deeper in the centre with saying the deepest part was where it began A I say it is generally the deepest where it commences—this wound was much deeper in the middle than at either end—the knife was apparently drawn from left to right—I have seen cases of suicide from cutting the throat Q Have you not almost invariably found that the wound has been inflicted from left to right A Generally—in short I may say in all cases—it would be much more convenient than the other way MR CLARKSON Q Do you in such instances see the wound inflicted from upwards to downwards A No and I have never seen a wound inflicted so low by a suicide COURT Q Would not that depend on how the instrument was held A Of course it must but suicides would hold the knife so as to make the wound go upwards—in this case the skin was cut completely through and the muscular substance below—the windpipe was not cut nor any large vessels Q Then the depth was not from front to back but more downwards A Yes more downwards CHARLES ASTON KEY I am senior surgeon at Guy s Hospital I have examined the prosecutrix s throat—I first saw it some day last week when the wound was quite healed—I had no means of judging whether it was a slanting or a horizontal wound—I have seen a great many cases where persons have committed suicide by cutting the throat—I have seen one this morning—in such cases the cutting is more usually effected upwards and I have never seen one so low down as this that I remember—certainly not by a suicide—this wound was undoubtedly very near the arteries the severance of which would in all probability have proved fatal Cross-examined Q Have you never seen a case of suicide in which the instrument took a downward direction A I cannot possibly say never but it is usually upwards—I do not ever recollect a case of its being downwards—it is more awkward for a person to inflict a wound down-wards with either hand—that would depend a great deal on the determinstion with which the party went to work—if he held the instrument firmly it would take an upward direction Q Suppose a woman with not a very strong nerve might not the wound take another direction A I should think it would make no difference—the edge of the knife is more commonly held upwards—the deeper parts are cut more upwards than the superficial parts Margaret Turner widow Weirs-passage Charlton-street Somer s-town Elizabeth Hubbard Windmill-street Tottenham Court-road Edward Gilham George-street Tottenham

Years Second Jury before Mr Common Sergeant 
t18390513-1534  1534 HENRY JONES was indicted for feloniously assaulting William Harley on the 16th of April at St John at Hackney and feloniously attempting to suffocate and strangle him by putting forcing and holding a certain handkerchief into against upon and over his mouth nose and face and by grasping pressing and squeezing him upon and about his neck and throat with intent feloniously wilfully and of his malice aforethought to kill and murder him —2nd COUNT for feloniously assaulting him with intent to rob him MR PHILLIPS conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM HARLEY I was a green-grocer but have retired from business I was in the habit of receiving the rents of small houses which I let for the owners—the prisoner occupied No 26 College-street Homerton—on the 16th of April he owed me four weeks rent—he came to my house about a quarter or twenty minutes after eight o clock that evening—I let him in and placed my candle on the counter—he said he was come to pay me some rent—I asked him for his book—he gave it to me—I asked him how much rent he was going to pay—he said three weeks which was 17s 6d and that he wanted change for a sovereign—I laid 2s 6d down on the counter—he did not take it up but kept his hand in his pocket as I thought to pull out the sovereign—we stood opposite each other at the time but he nestled round inside the counter and was telling me a long tale about his labour with Mr Burgess and what a little he had to support his family and if I heard of anything better for him to let him know—he still kept his hand in his pocket and then drew it out as I thought to lay down the sovereign—some piece of coin was no doubt under his hand but I could not get a glimpse of it for before it was well down his hand and handkerchief was up at my eyes and nose he crammed it into my mouth and broke out one of my teeth—I could not see as the handkerchief was over my eyes and partly down my mouth—I tried to call out but could not get the least breath or utter a word—by some means he fixed my arms so that I could only get the use of my fingers—he still kept me in that position my eyes blinded and my mouth stopped—he took hold of my throat and kept forcing me away from the counter towards a back-kitchen or wash-house which is twelve feet from the counter on the same floor but quite behind the house away from the front-door—he got me eleven feet from where the attack began against a door which leads down to a kitchen below stairs—I had the presence of mind being obliged to struggle for life for I could not breathe to kick against the kitchen-door which leads down stairs as I knew my niece was down there—I kicked against the door three times in my last struggle—he said It s no use it s no use if you make the least resistance or alarm it shall be the worse for you —he then griped my throat with more violence so that I lost my breath and my senses—I lost all consciousness altogether—when I came to myself I was lying with my hind-part in the wash-house and my head in the shop and the witnesses about me Prisoner Q Do you recollect calling at my house the morning before A I believe I did—I saw either your mother or wife I really do not recollect which—I called for rent and was told you would call on me—I was not sure you would come for your wife had told me a fortnight before that you were coming—they told me you would come this evening to see me—I had had that answer once or twice before—I did not state at Worship-street about my tooth being forced out for I was hardly in my senses then nor have I been perfectly clear ever since—I have been so hurt in my body inwardly I have hardly been able to go out of the house—my mouth was so sore my lips being cut so much I hardly knew I missed my tooth at the moment—I swear you did not lay a sovereign down on the counter—I saw no sovereign—I never said I saw one—I said you attempted to lay down a sovereign and it proved there was no sovereign to be found—I never said you laid one down ELEANOR PRECIOUS I am the prosecutor s niece On the night of the 16th of April I was in the kitchen and I heard a great scuffling in the shop and afterwards three very loud kicks at the door which aroused me—I opened the window got into the area and called Murder —two officers came to me—I told them they were murdering my uncle and to break the door open or he would be gone—they broke it open and when they came into the house I went up stairs—I found them helping my uncle who was in a state of insensibility bleeding at his nose and mouth—I afterwards went to sit on a chair in the shop and found a large hammer which did not belong to the shop—I had never seen it before—the prisoner was there at the time—I asked in his presence who owned it but no one owned it—nobody had left the house—my uncle came to his senses at last when they got him into the parlour—the prisoner was in the parlour—somebody asked my uncle what had happened—the prisoner stood before me—my uncle said Oh that Jones and then related what he had done to him—he said he had stopped his mouth with a handkerchief and dragged him to the wash-house-door—the prisoner said Oh Mr Harlcy don t accuse me of that it is a serious charge —he was taken into custody—the officer has the hammer—I had seen the place where I found it about twenty minutes before and there was no hammer there then Prisoner Q During the noise you heard were the kicks against the door or on the floor A Against the door and I heard a strangling noise—I heard nobody call me—I heard my uncle say you said you had brought a sovereign and wished for change—I did not hear him say he saw it on the counter—when I came up stairs my uncle was a very few steps from the door—there were several persons with him—Mr Etheridge had hold of him on one side—I cannot recollect who had hold of his other side—he was being led along as if he could not walk—he was insensible GEORGE THOMAS ETHERIDGE I am a cabinet-maker and parish constable On the 16th of April my attention was arrested by Precious—I went to Mr Harley s house with Tomalin my brother officer—I broke the door open—the shop was in darkness—a light was brought instantly and I found Mr Harley in the back part of the shop near the kitchen on the ground and the prisoner leaning over him—there was a small laceration on his forehead and his nose and mouth were bleeding likewise—he was not in his senses—I turned Jones round and said What is all this —he said Mr Harley is in a fit —I said Let us get him up —he assisted me to get him up—we got him up—a number of people came to his assistance—when he came to his senses he said It is that Jones and shook his head—he was not sensible at the moment but when he came to himself he said in Jones s presence what had happened to him—the prisoner said Mind what you say Mr Harley this is a serious charge —the prisoner was searched in my pretence at his own request—I found no sovereign—I searched the shop carefully and the counter but found no sovereign—I found two shillings and a sixpence on the counter and one shilling in the back kitchen Prisoner Q You state I was leaning over the prosecutor—what was I doing A In the act of lifting him up you said Don t you know me I said Yes I do —you said My name is Jones —I think I asked what was the matter and you said Mr Harley was in a fit—you assisted me in raising him from the ground—I think I was in the shop when the police-man examined the prosecutor s neck which he did in the parlour but am not positive and do not know the result—the prosecutor walked from the spot where I first saw him—when he came into the shop he came to his senses—I did not state at Worship-street that he was carried in a state of insensibility JOSEPH TOMALIN I accompanied Etheridge to Mr Harley s house—Etheridge broke the door open—I followed him in—I found the prosecutor lying on his back in the back kitchen adjoining the shop—his forehead was grazed the skin off and he was bleeding at the nose and mouth—I helped him up—the prisoner was standing in a stooping position when we went in—Etheridge said Halloo what is all this about —the prisoner turned round and said You know me—my name is Jones —I said What is the matter with Mr Harley —he said He has fallen down in a fit Prisoner Q Were you present when the policeman examined Mr Harley s throat A Yes—I did not see any marks of violence on his throat—I heard Mr Harley describe the way you used him—he said you forced your knuckles into his throat—I was not near enough to distinguish whether there were any marks—I stood in the shop—part of the examination was in the shop and part in the back place—I cannot say how long the door continued open after it was forced open I suppose some time— nobody went out to my knowledge—I cannot say whether every body who entered remained in the shop—I was by the door most of the time and saw nobody go out—there was nothing to hinder any body from going out—there was some blood from the prosecutor s forehead some from his nose and some from his lips—I should rather say the mark on the forehead was from a fall—I heard him say you came on purpose to pay three weeks rent and he thought you were going to tender him a sovereign—he said you put down a piece of money of some description he did not know what—he heard the money jink on the counter—he did not say it was a sovereign JOHN AYRES I am a policeman My attention was attracted to Mr Harley s house on the 16th of April and J took the prisoner into custody—I saw a hammer after it was found and have it here also the rent-book and a handkerchief which I found on the prisoner—I found no sovereign at all—I examined the prosecutor s throat but saw no marks of fingers on it Prisoner Q Were you present when he related what had happened A I was present when he began to make a statement—he said that you laid down a sovereign but he afterwards said he supposed it was a sovereign—Etheridge said he found a shilling and I believe that caused a suspicion that that was introduced for the sovereign—he appeared to have no doubt when he first spoke of its being a sovereign—there was a graze on his forehead and his head and lips were bleeding—I saw no blood from his nose but I do not know what might have been previous to my coming in—he was just being led into the parlour when I came in—there were no marks of blood on the handkerchief that I know of—it is a red handkerchief MR PHILLIPS Q Had Mr Harley a cravat on his neck A It was pulled off just before I came in whatever he had on—I have known the prisoner a length of time CHARLES HORTON PULLEY I am a solicitor—I know Mr Grove the Magistrate of Worship-street—I have seen him write repeatedly—this is his handwriting to this examination— read —the prisoner says I went to the prosecutor s house last night at a little after eight o clock to pay him some rent—I told him I wanted to pay 17s 6d for three weeks rent I told him to give me half-a-crown which he put on the counter—I put a sovereign down—he then said O my God and stumbled over the counter—I tried to catch him but in so doing we both went down together—I kicked with my feet for assistance and on doing so I heard the door burst open Prisoner s Defence On the night in question I went to the prosecutor s house about a quarter before eight o clock—the door was opened by the prosecutor who desired me to walk in and he shut the door after me—I told him I had come to pay three weeks rent—he asked for the rent-book which I gave him and he entered the sum in it—I took a sovereign from my waistcoat pocket and laid it on the counter—when he had done writing in the book he gave it me back—we then entered into conversation which was by my requesting him should he hear of a better situation than I had to let me know—he said he would if he heard of anything—I thanked him and said If you give me 2s 6d it will make it right —he put his hand into his pocket took out 3s 6d and laid 2s 6d on the counter—before I had time to take the money up I saw him raise one hand to the pit of his stomach and exclaim O my God —he seemed to stagger as if about to fall—I moved to the end of the counter and as he was falling caught him in my arms—his weight being too much for me we both fell together—I was well aware his niece was living with him and called to her and at the same time stamped on the floor—this I did while I was wiping the spittle from his mouth as he was foaming—I was raising him up and at that time the candle went out the door was burst open and Etheridge ran up exclaiming What is the matter who are you —I turned round and replied Why it s me —he said Who are you —I said Why Jones you know me very well —he said Is that you Jones what is the matter —I said Why Mr Harley is in a fit —the witness took hold of one arm while I did the other—the prosecutor being raised on his legs looked wildly round for some seconds—there were not less than twenty or thirty people in the shop—he walked into the side-parlour with assistance—he was not carried in in a state of insensibility—we seated him in a chair and after the lapse of about ten minutes to my surprise he accused me of having ill-treated him—among those who came into the shop was the policeman who took me into custody—I requested him in presence of several in the shop to examine the prosecutor s neck which he did but could not perceive the least mark or sign of violence—had I used the force by driving my knuckles into his throat as he stated surely some marks would have been left but there were none—one of the persons in the shop said Here is half-a-crown on the counter and Mr Newell who was present inquired of the prosecutor what had become of the sovereign which he had stated in the presence of several I had laid down on the counter—he replied he had not got the sovereign—he searched his pockets but could not find any sovereign—a general search was made by a dozen persons in and about the shop but the sovereign was not to be found—now full twenty minutes had elapsed before this search during which time the shop had been full of persons going in and out any one of whom might easily have taken the sovereign—somebody present insinuated that perhaps I had taken the sovereign up again—I requested the policeman to search me—he said if I wished it he would—he did so assisted by another policeman who had arrived but they found no money on me the sovereign in question being the only coin I had left home with and that was brought to pay my rent—the prosecutor had called at my house on Monday morning for the rent and my wife had told him I would call on Tuesday evening and pay him—he was well aware I was coming—the graze on the forehead I can only account for by the fall but the blood from his lips was occasioned by his biting them when on the ground—I deny any blood coming from his nose—they also state he was carried in a state of insensibility from where they first saw him to the little room—this is wrong—he walked merely by the assistance of myself and Etheridge having hold of an arm each—as to the hammer I solemnly declare I know nothing whatever about it—it does not belong to me and never was in my possession—had it belonged to me I had the opportunity of putting it away as I was not given in charge for at least a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes during which time the door remained open for anybody to enter or go out—I could have gone away entirely if inclined but relying on my innocence I certainly rendered all die assistance I could to the prosecutor—I solemnly declare I never used the least violence to him—I am utterly at a loss to account for his statement to-day which is untrue WILLIAM HARLEY re-examined I have never been subject to apoplectic or epileptic fits—I had two handkerchiefs on my neck a calico one and a black silk one over it—he got hold of the handkerchiefs and squeezed them up together with my throat Q Then he did not put his knuckles to your neck A He just got them inside once but then got them out and drew the handkerchiefs together—my neck was never examined—I never had the handkerchiefs pulled off at all to examine my neck—they were not pulled down at all to examine it—the policeman did not examine my neck GEORGE T ETHERIDGE re-examined I did not see the prosecutor s neckcloth taken off nor see his neck examined—it was not taken off in my presence JOHN AYRES re-examined I did not see his neck handkerchief taken off—I took the candle and his collar was pulled down—Mr Harley might not recollect it at the moment he being so frightened and alarmed but I certainly did examine it and that by the request of the prisoner ELEANOR PRECIOUS re-examined My uncle was never subject to fits—I never knew him have one GUILTY Aged 36 —On the First Count — Transported for Life

went into Unicorn-yard where the cry came from—I heard screams inside the house No 1 and knocked at the door—it was not opened directly—I said if it was not opened I should break it open and in half a second a little boy opened it—I went in and saw the prosecutrix on her back and the prisoner with his left hand on her throat—he had something in his right hand what it was I could not tell—I told him that would not do for me—knowing him well I said I shall take you out of this and took him out of the house—he said I want my pipe I shall go in —I said You shall not go in again —he said I will let you know with a very heavy oath — that I will go in —I said Bill you shall not go in —he said Then bl—y Itty by G—you shall have a bit of this before you shall take me which was a knife he had in his right hand—we then scuffled together—I threw him and I was upwards—while he was on the ground he drew the knife right across my face which you can see the scars of—he stabbed or cut roe right through the nose and cut me from the ear right to the nose—there are four distinct marks in my face from the ear to my throat—it was intended as one cut but the hair of my whisker checked it and it made four marks and afterwards he cut me right through the nostril—I sprang my rattle two or three times—Murray came up to my assistance while I was holding him—the prisoner knew I was an officer—I had not drank with the woman at all that night—the prisoner had come out of prison on the 6th of July Prisoner Q On that night did not you see me and Margaret come out of a public-house A No I do not think I saw herat all that night—you did not say to her Are you coming home —nor did she say I shall not come home with you —it is not true—I do not recollect seeing her that night at all till I heard the screams Prisoner I came home with my cousin and stopped an hour and a half—a girl told me she was along with Jennings who was off his beat—I could not find him—she was always with him—I went after her but could sot see her—when she came home I said You have been with Jennings —she said I have not —I said You had better go to bed —I went out for an hour and when I came in again she began to abuse me and bit my finger—I then threw her down to get away—I opened the door to Jennings myself—the boy never opened it—he came in and said What is all this about —I said It is not my fault she has called

and cuts on it—I took the prisoner away from him and brought him to the station-house—he said he had been sent twelve months to Brixton for nothing and he hoped he had done something now worthy of punishment and if I had not come up he would have done for Jennings Prisoner Q Did not you tell me you saw no knife in my hand A I did not see any knife in his hand because he was lying under Jennings so that I could not MARY MORGAN I am the wife of Thomas Morgan and live in Unicorn-square I picked up a knife close to where the prisoner and Jennings were struggling together—I saw them struggling—the knife was open—I gave it to sergeant Rowe JOHN STADDEN I am a surgeon and live in Union-street I examined Jennings on the morning of the 3rd of July—I found a cut on the left side of his nose perforating the nostril—a wound under the upper lip another on the left side of the mouth and one by the left ear—they were such wounds as this knife might have produced—it appeared to me that the knife had glanced off by the whisker or bone but I think there had been more than one cut—the knife appeared to have struck against the angle of the lower jaw and in the struggle a man lowering his head might have prevented its going lower Prisoner Q Was not my head cut A I did not see him till he was at the office—he had some dressing on his head as if he had been injured Prisoner

intent to maim and disable him —2nd COUNT stating his intent to be to do him some grievous bodily harm MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution AUGUSTUS MANUEL GOUGENHEIM I am a Frenchman but have lived fifteen or sixteen years in this country—I am an interpreter and translator of several languages—I have only seen the prisoner twice—he called at my place seven or eight months ago and requested me to attend before the Commissioners of the Westminster Court of Requests to answer to a debt to which he had rendered himself liable from a female he used to visit—he was then quite a stranger to me—I took down his instructions and found there was no cause why he should not pay the debt if the woman did not—I explained to him that no defence could be made to it and it was arranged that I should obtain time to pay the debt and costs—I was to be paid 3s for translating a paper for him and 3s for my own attendance—I did not attend on the day the case was heard before the Commissioners as I was retained to interpret at Union Hall for a foreigner and I sent my wife with full instructions to act—she brought me back the adjudication of the debt to be paid at three monthly instalments—I sent that by my servant to the prisoner s house—I did not make any personal application is the amount was so trifling—I sent my servant once or twice but did not receive the money—on Saturday the 17th of August I saw the prisoner in Oxendon-street Haymarket—I crossed the road touched my hat to him and said Mr Courben when do you mean to pay me —he said Never —I said If that is the case I shall summon you in the Court of Requests next Monday —he immediately flew into a violent passion and said Before you summons me I shall smash your face — all this conversation was in French —he immediately stepped back one or two paces making two or three motions as if to conceal what he was doing and he thrust his cane at my eye with a very strong thrust—it burst the ball of my eye and the aqueous matter ran down his wrist—I had not offered him the least violence either personally or verbally—he attempted to run away but was stopped by a stranger passing by—I went to the station-house and gave him in charge and was taken to Mr Wood the surgeon—I have entirely lost the sight of the eye—I lost it at that very moment and nearly lost my life for brain-fever or locked jaw was anticipated by the medical man for the first four days—It was done with the small end of the cane DAVID LAROACH I live in King-street Golden-square I was in Oxenden-street on the 17th of August and saw the injury inflicted on the prosecutor s eye by the prisoner—I had never seen either of the parties before—the prosecutor did not offer the least violence to the prisoner—he stood with his thumb in the sleeve of his waistcoat JAMES RICHARDSON I lodged in Bury-street St James s at the time in question I was in company with the prosecutor walking arm in arm—he left me and crossed over to speak to the prisoner—he went up to him and gently tapped him on the shoulder with his hand and appeared to speak to him—the prisoner by his manner flew into a violent passion—he seemed to take a step backwards take a deliberate aim and with his cane made a violent thrust and thrust out the prosecutor s eye—the prosecutor had not struck or offered to strike him WILLIAM SUDBURY At the time in question I lived in Oxenden-street—I was in the street on this occasion and witnessed the transaction—the witnesses have spoken truly-no violence was offered by the prosecutor before he received the thrust—I saw the blow struck with the cane—it appeared distinctly aimed at the eye THOMAS WOOD I am a surgeon and live in Panton-street The prosecutor was brought to me on Saturday the 17th of August—I found he had lost his eye from a wound—the sight was quite gone—I examined the injury—in my judgment it was such a one as might have been inflicted by thrusting the point of a cane into the eye—It could not have been inflicted without considerable violence—the smaller end of this cane produced would inflict the injury—I saw him occasionally for about a month—he suffered a good deal of pain—there was reason to anticipate dangerous consequences although his health was good-such a blow was calculated to produce locked jaw but I rather anticipated brain fever—It was a very dangerous wound GEORGE BURY I am a policeman I received charge of the prisoner from the prosecutor—I took this cane from the prisoner and have had it ever since Prisoner s Defence Through an interpreter At five o clock on the 17th of August I went to Panton-street—I was on the left hand side going along—the prosecutor tapped me on the shoulder and said If you do not bring me by to-morrow what you owe me I will put my foot in your —I said Do it which proves I did not pursue him—to avoid him I went on the other side of the way and when I was on the right-hand pavement he followed me and said Wherever I meet you I will put you in a state of uneasiness —he called me a rogue—I said Let me alone and do as you please about it —I tried to go away from him about twelve paces but he came after me again and repeating that I was a rogue gave me a knock with his fist on my left side-as I came back he tried to give me another and unfortunately I took up my cane to prevent his striking me GUILTY on the 2nd Count Aged 60 —

t18390916-2455  2455 JAMES SHANLEY was indicted for unlawfully maliciously and feloniously assaulting John Cardingne on the 11th of September and stabbing and wounding him upon his right eyebrow with

carpenter but am occasionally employed as a broker s man—I am often employed by Mr Wearing—on the 11th of September I was employed by him to go to No 2 Great Arthur-street Golden-lane St Luke s to remove some goods which had been distrained-Wearing and Wooding were with me-we got there between five and six o clock—Wooding knocked at the door—the man in possession opened it and we all three went in—I saw the prisoner sitting on a chair—he said You are come are you —he said The first that touches the things I will run a knife into him —I stepped forward and so did Mr Wearing—we all three stepped forward and I was the first—I said to him You had better not do such a thing as that —I was persuading him and said Don t put yourself in a passion —he jumped up off the chair immediately—there was a clasp-knife lying open on the table close to hit hand—he laid hold of it and struck me immediately over the eyebrow—It penetrated and I fell against the wainscoting—It was a very violent blow—I could not move—I lost above a pint of blood in less than five minute—I saw the blood about the place—I was taken to Mr Leeson the surgeon in about half an hour—my handkerchief and apron were put to stop the blood before I went there—It bled all night long after I went home—the surgeon washed my face with some warm water and dressed the wound—I have been in great pain in my head just on my eyebrow ever since—I can see with my eye but it is inflamed very much still—I do not believe the prisoner was under the influence of liquor Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Was that the only room occupied by the prisoner A I believe it was-Wearing spoke first when we went in—I cannot tell what he said—I might have heard it—It was very few words—I cannot tell what answer the prisoner made—I did not see a bed in the room—there was a recess for a bedstead to go in-we had not time to touch the goods-neither of us began to meddle with the goods—I saw a bedstead without any clothes—that I swear—I cannot say whether there was any body on it—It was in a dark place—I saw nobody in the room but us three and the prisoner—the prisoner was sitting by the fire-place—the table was not between us—the other two were close by me not in front of me-Wooding went in first-we went in close together—I saw no child on the bed—I had not been in the room two minutes before my eyebrow was cut—I do not know Mrs Hook— looking at her —I never saw her before—I never said to her The boy on the bedstead struck me twice in the eye nor any thing of the sort—she did not offer to get me any assistance—a policeman came in and assisted me—It was a clasp-knife about four inches long with a sharp point—I saw it on the table-Wearing did not say his is what he struck you with and show me part of the bedstead top MR H EATON Q How much of the bedstead could you see A I could see part of it up and part of it lying about the room—I did not see any one on it—I never said that any one on the bedstead struck me in EDWARD BIRD WEARING I am a broker and live in Ward s-row the eye Bethnal Green-road I made a distress on the prisoner s premises about eleven or twelve o clock on this morning—the prisoner was not there then—I left Barton in possession and went again about five o clock in the afternoon with Cardingne and Wooding for the purpose of arranging the matter without seizing but when I went in the prisoner got up from his chair and said Oh you are come and I think he said he would job my eye out if I offered to take a thing—I am not sure that was the expression but I am sure he said something about the eye—he had a knife in his hand—that prosecutor said You must not do that and the moment he said that the prisoner turned round and said I will give it to you —he immediateiy said I will serve one of you out then and struck Cardingne on the side of the eye with the knife which had been lying on the cable— I had shown him our authority—the table was close to him and I saw the knife on it —the wound bled very much—the prisoner kept wearing and said be wished he had done for one of us—he was very violent—I went out directly and got two policemen who took him into custody or I think there would have been murder-his wife was in the room at the time the blow was struck—she was very violent all the time and kept hagging him on to serve us out Cross-examined Q Who spoke first when you went in A He did—he jumped up and said Oh you have come have you —I said Yet we are come to arrange this matter if we can but he would not hear anything—he said he would job out the eye of the first person that touched anything and he said the first person that touched the goods he would run a knife into—he might have said that first but I cannot say for the woman made such a noise—he said many things—he also said he would do for one of us—he was very violent—he got up when we went in and came forward but did not come right up to me at once—there was a bed and bedstead in the room—the amount of the rent due was 11s 6d —there were two old bedsteads in the room and some bed clothes on the floor—I had taken them down and was going to throw them out of the window—the man had got the bedstead down before I got there I saw the bedstead distinctly as soon as I went into the room—I do not know that every one in the room could see it for there was a kind of projection before it—the bedstead was part of the things distrained—It was a little stump bedstead which takes all to pieces—there was a top to it—the rails were down—there were no tables or chairs—the bedsteads were worth about 4s each—I will swear there was no child in the bed MR HEATON Q Before he struck the prosecutor had he struck him A Not at all—he had not done or said anything to provoke him JAMES WOODING I am a cabinet-maker and live in Ward s-row Bethnal Green-road On the 11th of September I went with Cardingne and Wearing to the prisoner s house about five o clock in the afternoon— when we went in the prisoner was sitting in a chair and said You are come are you I will job out the eye of the first man that dares take any of my things away —the prisoner took up a knife from the table and made a thrust with it—I rather expect it was intended for Wearing but it caught Cardingne—Cardingne had said to him You must not do that —I took up a piece of wood and knocked the knife out of the prisoner s hand—It was a clasp knife—the handle was about four inches or four inches and a half long—I did not see the blade distinctly—I cut Cardingne on the top of the eye—he bled most tremendously—he moved and leand against the wainscot to support himself-a policeman was sent for Cross-examined Q What things were in the room A Some chairs and a deal table—the prisoner was the first that spoke I believe when we went in—he said What you are come are you and he said he would job out the eye of the first man that moved any thing of his—I cannot say whether he said he would run a knife into the first person—he said a great deal—I did not look for the knife—I was afraid to stop in case I should be struck with something myself—I believe the prisoner s wife made away with the knife-some bed-clothes laid down by the side of the bed—there was a boy in the room eleven or twelve years old—I never saw him on the bed—he had not a bit of bedstead rail in his hand—I will swear that positively MR HEATON Q Had the prosecutor struck or attempted to strike the prisoner or done any thing to provoke these blows from him A He had not COURT Q What makes you think that the thrust was meant for Wearing A By his stating that he knew him well and it seemed to be aimed rather in the direction of Wearing-Wearing was close by Cardingne—the prisoner said repeatedly he would die for one he did not care which—that was while Wearing was gone for the police—I only suppose the blow was not meant for Cardingne by its coming in that direction—Wearing was rather nearer to the prisoner than Cardingne—the blow was struck immediately on Cardingne saying that JOHN CARDINGNE re-examined I cannot say whether the prisoner struck at me or at Wearing but he struck me E B WEARING re-examined I think the blow was intended for me because he knew me SOLOMON HANNAN I am a policeman I was fetched by Mr Wearing—when I got to the house I saw Cardingne and the prisoner—he was making use of violent language—he was given into my custody for stabbing the prosecutor in the eye—on the way to the station-house he said he did not stab the man or that he did not stab him in the eye—the prosecutor was bleeding very much from the right eyebrow Cross-examined Q He was very much excited was he not A Yes JOHN LEESON I am a surgeon of the police and live in Chigwell-street On the 11th of July I was sent for to the station-house but being engaged my assistant went—I examined the prosecutor the following morning and found a wound on the right eyebrow which appeared to have been inflicted with a sharp instrument-if it had been half an inch lower his sight would have been lost—the bone was not injured Cross-examined Q Was there not a mark of a contusion round the incision A No it was not a contused wound it was an incised wound—there was not time for any contusion to have gone off—I should hardly think a pint of blood could have been lost from the wound but there might be a great deal MR HEATON Q Could it have been done by a blunt instrument A It did not appear so—if it was a contused wound there would have been the appearance of contusion for some days after MR HORRY called SARAH HOOK My husband is an awl-blade maker and lives in Great Arthur-street—we have lived there twenty-four years—I did not attend before the Magistrate in this case I was too late—I never saw the prosecutor till the day in question when the prisoner s wife opened her window and called for assistance—I went directly to see what was the matter and saw the prosecutor—the blood was running from his temple—he took up his handkerchief to wipe it off—I said to him How was this done and who did it —he said The boy that was lying on the bed took up a stick or I believe it was a bit of the railing which goes across the tent-bedstead and he has hit me with it —the boy was sitting on a chair when I went up—I said to him Have you done this —he said Yes I have —the policemen came in and the prosecutor spoke to them—I heard him saying something about some instrument which had been used and when I heard him telling a false hood I went up to him and said What did you say to me just row —he said I said nothing to you whatever you are a very false woman —I mentioned to the policeman what he had said—the policeman to me Did you see the blow struck —I said No I saw nothing I only know what he stated to me MR HEATON Q Are you well acquainted with the prisoner and his wife A I keep a shop in the general line and they are customers of mine—Wooding was present when the prosecutor told me this and Wearing also—but they did not hear it—I dare say they were two or three yards from the prosecutor at the time he told me—I was very near Wearing—the room is very small—he spoke so that I could hear him—I do not know that the others could hear him—they were occupied with the prisoner respecting his money—they might have heard it—I cannot say—I heard it—my hearing is very good—the two brokers went out while I was chastising the boy for doing it—I do not mean beating him but asking him how he came to do such a thing and the two policemen came in—Hannan is one of them—I told him what the prosecutor had said to me and both the brokers were present at the time—the boy was sitting on a chair at the time by the side of his father—I believe he is about thirteen or fourteen years old—the prisoner s wife and son do not lodge with me nor are they going to do so MR HORRY Q When you went to the Magistrate did any body fetch you there A No—I went thinking to do them a kindness but the case had been heard SOLOMON HANNAN re-examined Q You have heard what that woman has said is it true or false A I did not hear the prosecutor tell her she is a false woman nor did I hear her say he was a false man—she told me that he had told her the boy did it—the prosecutor said the prisoner did it with a knife and that was what he stated to me in the first instance MR HORRY Q If he said You are a false woman you were not in a situation to hear it A Yes I must have heard it E B WEARING re-examined The prosecutor never told that woman in my presence that a boy did it with a stick—he could not have told her so without my hearing it because we were all close together MR HORRY Q You saw her there A I saw her just at the door—I do not think she was inside the place—Cardingne did not say any thing to her—I do not believe he saw her for he was bleeding JAMES WOODING re-examined Cardingne did not tell that woman in my hearing that a boy did it with a stick—I could not have been of hearing it if he had said so COURT Q Did the boy use a stick at all A No I did not see him with a stick—he could not have struck a blow without my seeing it GUILTY Aged 35 — Transported for Fifteen Years Fourth Jury before Mr Justice Vaughan 
t18390916-2456  2456 ANDREW MCCAFFREY was indicted for unlawfully maliciously and feloniously assaulting Patrick Murray on the 13th of August and stabbing and wounding him upon his belly with intent to maim and disable him 2nd COUNT stating his intent to be to do him some grievous bodily harm MR HEATON conducted the Prosecution PATRICK MURRAY I am a whalebone-bristle-cutter and live in Green Anchor-court Fore-street I was at the Duke of Bedford public-house in Golden-lane about twenty minutes after eleven o clock on the night of the 13th of August with my wife—the prisoner was sitting there when I went in—I was standing opposite the bar—I had not been in the house above two or three minutes when a row commenced between two men—the prisoner was not one of them but he had a stick in his hand and was going to strike a blow over one of the men s heads—I caught hold of the stick to prevent his striking the blow—we were scuffling for two or three minutes and in the struggle I felt a pain in the lower part of my belly—I was then pushed out of the house by the barman—I saw a policeman outside and told him what had passed—he went and examined in the passage of the next house and I found I had been stabbed with a knife near the centre of my belly alongside the navel—I had on a pair of moleskin trowsers—the stab was lower than the waistband of the trowsers on the flap—I had never seen the prisoner before—I went with the policeman and gave the prisoner in charge in the public-house—Mr Leeson s assistant saw me the same evening and dressed my wound—I had blood on my shirt which was cut through as well as my trowsers—I was not able to do any thing for four or five days—I saw nothing of the knife before the scuffle Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Did the prisoner appear a stranger to your wife A That I cannot say—I do not know whether she knew him or not—I never heard her say she did—we have been married eight years—I never heard from her that she had any quarrel with him—she tried to get me out of the row as well as she possibly could—she did not strike the prisoner to my knowledge—I did not see it—I am given to understand it was the prisoner s son who was quarrelling and the prisoner was endeavouring to strike his son s opponent—I was sober—I had hold of the prisoner s stick and he tried to get it from me—he pushed me against the wall—I did not see the point of the stick at all COURT Q Was it while you were struggling with him against the wall that your wife came to your assistance A Yes MARGARET MURRAY I am the prosecutor s wife I went to the Duke of Bedford public-house on the night in question with my husband to have a pint of beer and saw the prisoner there—I had never seen him before and had no knowledge of him—before we could call for the beer a row commenced with two men and they began to fight—the prisoner had a black Stick in his hand which he began to strike the other one over the head with—my husband went to lay hold of the stick and the prisoner caught hold of my husband and got him up against the wall—I saw the prisoner put his hand into his pocket—he had nothing in his hand then—I saw a black handled clasp-knife in his hand when he took his hand from his pocket—It was open at the time I saw it—seeing it open I went between him and my husband and in the scuffle the knife cut my wrist—the barman came and put my husband out of the house—I did not know at the time that the prisoner had struck my husband with the knife—I did not see any blow struck with it—I followed him out—a policeman was passing at the time—I was not present in the passage—but as he came out of the passage of the adjoining house I went with him to the public-house—he said he had been stabbed and the prisoner was the man and gave him in charge—my husband continued ill five or six days Cross-examined Q Is your mother s name Griffiths A No prendergast—Griffiths is her name by my father—I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge—I did not see him in July—I do not know that my mother had any wrangle with him—I swear that—I never said I would split his head open if I caught him in a public-house—I do not know where he lives—I know a person named Haley in Golden-lane—I will swear I never had any quarrel with the prisoner nor ever made any threat against him—I was never present when my mother had any quarrel with him—I went between the prisoner and my husband when my husband was against the wall—I had been to that public-house with my husband before—we had never been turned out before—there were about eight or nine persons present when the struggle was going on—I do not know what became of the stick—I think the policeman has the knife—the prisoner said he wished my husband might bleed to death as he went along to the station-house and he said so twice in the station-house—he made a kick at my husband s lower parts and I pushed my husband away from him—he did not put his hand into his pocket while he was struggling with the stick—he had not the stick in his hand when he had hold of my husband with one hand and I saw him put his hand down into his pocket and afterwards saw the knife open in his hand—I am quite sure it was open COURT Q Your wrist was Cut in going between them A Yes when I went between them—I did not at that time receive a blow from any body else—the prisoner s son was in the public-house but he did not strike me at all GEORGE WILKINSON police-sergeant G 18 On the night in question I was near the public-house and heard a noise—I went towards it and saw Murray—he made a complaint to me—I examined and saw a wound bleeding at the belly—we went into the next house with him—he pointed out the prisoner as having stabbed him and I took him into custody—I found this black-handled knife in his waistcoat-pocket with another knife with a white handle—there was no blood on them—in going along to the station-house he said he wished the prosecutor might bleed to death JOHN LEESON I am surgeon of the G division of police I saw the prosecutor next morning—he appeared to have a punctured wound a few inches below the navel—a knife was very likely to hare made it—the bowels were not wounded but if it had proceeded a little further it would have been mortal—it was very near the bowels Cross-examined Q Might it have been done by a sharp-pointed stick A No I made several punctures with the stick which has a point and with the knife in the trowsers and the original puncture seemed to be made with the knife Thomas Weals landlord of the Duke of Bedford Edward Dedderige the barman Caroline Hislop wife of a shoemaker in Harper-street and Joseph Johnson a gold and silver wire-drawer gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY on Second Count Aged 42 — Transported for Fifteen Years

detainer ELIZA KING My father keeps the Cart and Horses public-house in Clerkenwell The prisoner came to the house on the 3rd of October in the evening—I do not know at what time he came in—he had been in the house before the disturbance took place—in the course of the evening there was a disturbance and I went into the tap-room and saw him quarrelling with some people there—I begged him to be quiet—he answered It is not my fault —I said Well sit down and take no notice and be quiet —I left the tap-room again—I again heard another noise and entered the room again—I then saw him standing by the fire-place and a chimney-sweep standing by the door with a little blood on his face as if he had been struck by somebody—I again begged of the prisoner to be quiet and not to ill-use the sweep for he was tipsy—he said I had nothing to do with it—I said I had a good deal to do with it for there was a disturbance in the house and I could not suffer such conduct there—he then threatened to strike me and used very bad language—I was frightened and said I supposed he took advantage of me because my father and brother were absent—I came out and sent Miss Smith for my brother John who lives next

him I cannot say but he came quietly from the tap-room door to the street door and there I saw him scuffle with Bullock apparently trying to throw him down and by and by I saw Bullock bleeding—finding there was no other policeman near to protect him 1 called out Police as loud as I could and assistance came—after the mob had dispersed from the door a man picked up a knife which I looked at and returned to the man and told him to take it after them—it was a white handled pocket-knife with the point broken off—I cannot recollect what I or my brother said to the policeman when he first came

house as it was gone to be repaired Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was the prisoner a customer in the habit of frequenting your house A Yes I believe he sells cat s-meat about in a barrow—there might have been about a dozen people in the tap-room at first—I cannot tell exactly—the prisoner was not quarrelling with a man named Turner—I do not know whether he was in the tap-room—I know he was in the house—I believe the prisoner was sober—it was not became he was intoxicated that I refused to serve him any more—I cannot swear what my brother said to the policeman—the prisoner did not strike me nor attempt to do so but he threatened it JOHN KING I am brother of last witness—I was sent for and came to the house—I found the prisoner there—he wanted some more beer my sister would not serve him and I told him to leave the house—when I came in she complained that he had threatened to strike her—I can hardly remember whether that complaint was made in his presence but to the best of my

out of the tap-room door with him quietly—when he got to the street-door just stepping out he put one arm round Bullock and jobbed him in the face with the other hand—I suppose it was with a knife but I did not see it I saw blood flow immediately all over the prisoner from Bullock—Bullock held him for some minutes after he was stabbed—they struggled—the prisoner put his legs between Bullock s as if to throw him but Bullock turned him on his back before he left him—other policemen came to his assistance after some time as I called for the police—he was taken away and Bullock was taken to the surgeon s—I was not there when the knife was found Cross-examined Q Was he standing quietly before the fire when Bullock came in A I did not take particular notice I cannot say whether he was or not—Bullock went in first and I followed—I did not see him till Bullock took him in charge—he just put his hand on him and said You must come along with me —he might have put his hand on his arm—I was within a yard and a half of him—to the best of my recollection I think he was standing by the table when Bullock went in but I do not recollect JOHN BULLOCK police-constable G 116 On the night of the

t18400203-768  768 EDWARD MURPHY was indicted for unlawfully maliciously and feloniously assaulting Daniel Mahoney on the 28th of December and stabbing cutting and wounding him upon his left thigh and head with intent to kill and murder him —2nd COUNT stating his intent to be to maim and disable him —3rd COUNT to do him some grievous bodily harm DANIEL MAHONEY I am a shoemaker The prisoner lodged with me for nearly twelve months at No 8 Queen-street Mint in the Borough On the 28th of December between nine and ten o clock at night I went up stairs to a room on the third floor for a bed which I had lent to two young women five or six weeks before as they had none to lie on—they were no relations of the prisoner nor did they live with him—he lodged in the same room With me on the first floor—when I went up I found the door shut—I knocked at it and was answered by the prisoner and he said I will get the bed immediately —in five or six minutes be opened the door and said Here is your b——bed —the bed was then rolled down stairs and he held a light in his hand and said Come you can come in and see if she is here —I went in and told him it made no matter to me where she was but he should be ashamed to commit such nastiness in a house where so many people lived— I had been told that he and the young woman Mary Hurley had been in bed together that night which made me go up for the bed —there was no woman in the room then—there was a candle in the room and a fire too—the prisoner had the candle in his hand—he said There are so and so bad in the house alluding to other lodgers—I came down to my own room—I went up again in a minute or two afterwards and when I got very near the door the prisoner threw the candlestick from his hand into the room—he was inside the room—I observed the light thrown on the floor as I stood on the stairs—as soon as I crossed the door and got into the room 1 received a stab on my left thigh in front from the prisoner—I fell on the boards as my flesh trembled—I fell right on the spot—I called out to Fitzgerald the landlord and told him my leg was broken—he was in my apartment at the time—I said nothing lo the prisoner—Fitzgerald came to my assistance and as soon as I got up I fell again on the floor and remained there some time—I had not felt any thing else done to me before Fitzgerald came—I could not remember what passed after the second fall—I became quite stupid after receiving the stab—I fell in attempting to get up of my own accord—that was after Fitzgerald came in—I did not know of any other harm being done to me except the stab on the thigh but I found afterwards that I had received eight cuts two on my forehead and the remainder about my head before and behind—two were on the back of my neck—I perceived that when I got to the hospital about eleven o clock the same night—I cannot tell when or how they were done—I came to myself at the hospital—I had a stab in the breast of my shirt but it did not go quite to the flesh—it was a stab or cut—it was done at the same time—I had not done or said any thing to the prisoner—I never offended him at all—I was ill from the 28th of December till last Monday morning—I was an in-patient of Guy s hospital till then Prisoner I was in his company all Christmas week drinking from one public-house to another and lent him money to spend Witness I was with him sometimes having been together several times for a couple of days—he did not lend me money—he gave me some which was due to me for rent—I did not borrow half-a-crown of him—I did not ask him for it—he told me he might as well give it me then as at another time—that was on Thursday morning I think the morning after boxing-day—more than that would fall due to me on the Saturday night following—it was not due until the Saturday—he was paying me 4s 4d for lodging tea and potatoes Prisoner On the Saturday following I lent him another shilling Witness He gave me another shilling—that was the same as the first for rent—there was 4s 4d due Prisoner His wife-lent me an article to go and raise money on to spend in drink and the last shilling he had was out of that money Witness I know nothing of that—he told me he had borrowed it of the landlord underneath SARAH PLEDGER I am a married woman I know Mahoney and I have known the prisoner a short time On the night of the 28th of December between nine and ten o clock I was there—I went up stairs to the first room for some money which Mary Hurley owed me—I went to her room but received no answer at the door—I came down again and met the prosecutor s wife in the passage—I then went up to Mahoney s room and in about twenty minutes he went up stairs for the bed in Hurley s room—I was down stairs in his room and saw him bring the bed down—he only remained a few moments and then went up stairs to the same room after some chairs—I was on the stairs behind him at the time the door was open and I saw the prisoner there before the light was put out—there was a candle when Mahoney first entered the room but it was knocked out of the prisoner s hand—I cannot say whether he dropped it or whether it was knocked out of his hand but if it was it was by Mahoney falling at the time—I saw the prisoner hit Mahoney about the head as I thought with his fist—Mahoney was down on the floor at the time—I did not observe how he came there—he fell right in the moment he entered the room and the prisoner fell on the top of him—I did not hear a word spoken—Fitzgerald lifted Mahoney up and was carrying him down stairs and then I saw the prisoner take and kick him either about the shoulders or head I cannot say which—it was a kick with his foot not a blow—after the prosecutor was brought down I went up again with a light and saw blood on the floor in two or three places but it had been wiped up—I could see the places where it had been—there were two big places—Mahoney was in a dreadful state when he was brought down—I thought his bowels were in his small clothes—he was very insensible—we could make nothing of him—he was taken to the hospital in about half-an-hour—he got his senses a little before he went but not much I think—I cannot say whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand at the time he hit him—I did not see any instrument till I saw a piece of a knife produced next morning which was found by the police in the next garret Prisoner I had been in her company along with the other woman that night—she was dancing along with me and the other woman Witness I was not—I never saw him on the Saturday night only when he had a bunch of turnips when he was at market with his wife—he was not sober when I saw him in Redcross-street about three quarters of an hour before this happened—he was in liquor then PETER LOGAN I am a policeman On the night of the 28th of December I went to this house No 8 Queen-street Mint at very near ten o clock and went to an up-stairs room—I did not get admission on knocking and broke the door open—I found nobody in the room—I saw the stairs were clotted with blood and the floor of the room had blood fresh wiped off it—I only noticed that in one particular place on the floor but on the stairs there were several places where the blood was not wiped up—it was between the two stories—I took the prisoner about a quarter-past ten o clock in the adjoining garret—I asked him if he had got a knife about him—he said he had not—I asked him no more questions but took him into custody—he was asked what he had stabbed the man with—he said he had no knife—I saw part of a knife picked up under a table in the garret where we found him—it appeared fresh broken—I found nothing more that night—I returned next morning and a person who rented the garret gave me the other part of the knife—she is not here—it is the point—I think it corresponds with the other part but there is some doubt about it—where the woman found it I cannot say JOSEPH RICHARD BEDFORD I am a student at Guy s Hospital and have been so six years and a half—I am twenty-four years old On the 28th of December the prosecutor was brought in about eleven o clock at night in a state of considerable exhaustion—I examined him and found a very severe wound on the left thigh—it passed inwards and downwards and was between four and five inches in depth—there must have been a great loss of blood—that was apparent from the state of his clothing—it was not bleeding the moment he arrived but very shortly after it did bleed—I observed I think eight cuts on his head—they were merely su-perficial cuts—they must have been done by a cutting instrument of some sort—the wound in the thigh must have been made by a pointed and cutting instrument—he remained there until last Monday morning—the wound is not quite healed yet—there was very great danger attending the wound at first from the loss of blood and from an operation that might have been required—he might have bled to death—I think this knife formed one blade but there seems a portion of it gone now—if that was an entire knife I think it possible it might have made the wound in the thigh—I think it must have been a sharper instrument but it is possible Prisoner I have only to throw myself in the hands of you and the jury—I will ask the prosecutor as to my character DANIEL MAHONEY re-examined I have known him twelve months—he was sometimes very agreeable at other times very dissatisfied—sometimes in a good humour and sometimes not GUILTY Aged 38 —On the 3rd Count — Transported for Fifteen Years Before Mr

the Brill public-House Somers-town on Saturday night the 1st of August about a quarter before twelve o clock—the prisoner was there and we had two or three words—he shoved against me—I asked what he did that for—he told me he would smack my face—I did not shove against him in return—I walked outside and stood there till he came out and he leant up against the railing—I went over to him and asked what he insulted me for in the house—I merely put my hand on his collar and he took and ran a knife into my side—here is the wound—I attempted then to strike him but fell back against the railing and told Grady I was stabbed—he went over to catch hold of him to give him into custody and he made a dart with the knife at Grady and if he had not stood back he would have put the knife into his belly—I was taken to the station-house and sent from there in a cab to the hospital—I was only there one night—I had my waistcoat jacket and shirt on—the knife went through them all Cross-examined by MR PAYNE

others—none of them struck the prisoner—I work for Mr Hill near Pancras Church who has houses of his own—I do jobs about the place for him—any thing in the labouring line—I had work from him on the Monday morning and this happened the Saturday night—I was working for him all the week before—I work there ten hours in the day emptying cesspools and colouring walls at his different houses—the prisoner and I did not get to high words—I did not catch hold of his collar—I put my hand on his collar to ask what he insulted me for—it was a quarter before twelve o clock when we wore inside and half-after twelve this happened outside Q How did it begin A Young Grady went over to him and spoke to him he had some words with Grady and I went over and he took and shoved me—I had done nothing to him—I saw Mitchell outside—I did not see Spurrier—there was no woman there—I could not tell if there were two women in the prisoner s company—there were a good many people in the house—I was drinking with about three others—I did not say I would strike him or use any offensive expression to him nor did Grady threaten to do so in my presence—I did not ask the prisoner to fight—he did not say he was not capable of fighting with me—I and my companions did not give him several blows no blows were struck at all—Grady is a labourer—I have no other means of getting my living than I have mentioned—just before this a man named Sullivan and another came down and awoke me out of bed on purpose to fight me—Sullivan brought a poker—I am often in Grady s company but not with the others ALFRED STANFORD I was at the Brill public-house on the 1st of August at a quarter before twelve o clock—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor there wrangling inside—I do not know what they were wrangling about—M Carthy went out and the landlord turned the prisoner out—I went out about a minute after—I had seen no blows take place before they went out nor any shoving—they were talking and wrangling—after I was outside I saw them wrangling again for eight or ten minutes—I then saw the prisoner put his hand into his pocket and pull out something but what I could not see but it appeared an instrument—he placed his right hand behind him M Carthy went up and clapped his hand on the prisoner s shoulder the prisoner then took and plunged it into his side—M Carthy hallooed out He has stabbed me I felt him pull it out of my side —he was taken into custody—the prosecutor had not given him any blows that I saw Cross-examined Q Did not the landlord turn them both out A No—I can swear that—he is not here—I was not with M Carthy—I was on the opposite side taking a pint of beer—I knew all the parties—I had been in the house an hour and a half—I cannot say how the matter began—the place was full—I afterwards saw that the prisoner s thumb was cut and bleeding COURT Q Did the prisoner say any thing about that A Yes he hallooed out I am stabbed in the thumb —that was after the prosecutor had spoken of being stabbed—I did not find the knife JOHN ROSE I was at the Brill public-house that night and saw M Carthy and Gates—I saw M Carthy go out and the landlord and one of the barmen came over the bar and put the prisoner out—I remained in about ten minutes afterwards and then went out—I saw a jangling between Gates and M Carthy—I stood just behind M Carthy—Gates took his hand from behind him and said You b—— or You b——b—— I will stab you and then plunged his hand towards him as far as he could—I did not hear any other words to my knowledge—M Carthy said I am stabbed —I was then in the act of going round to catch hold of Gates when the policeman dashed in and secured both of them and prevented my going near Gates—I stood at the station-house door and when M Carthy came out to go to the surgeon I went with him—he was wounded in his side—he was taken to the doctor s shop and there he fainted away with my pressing his wound up with a handkerchief—a cab was brought and we took him to the hospital Cross-examined Q Did you see the prisoner and prosecutor quarrelling in the Brill public-house A I saw some sort of jangle between them but was not near enough to hear any words pass—I did not see the landlord turn M Carthy out—he turned Gates out—I was examined before the Magistrate—I did not see what Gates had done to be turned out but I was in there a very short time previous—I heard some words passing but did not pay particular attention till I saw Gates turned out COURT Q How long did you stay in the house after Gates was turned out A Between five and ten minutes as near as possible—I never knew M Carthy before—I cannot recollect how it began—I was at a distance ALFRED VIGOR police-constable S 116 I was on duty in Weston-street and saw a great mob before the Brill public-house—I went up jumped right between them and caught hold of the two middle ones who were scuffling—it was M Carthy and Gates—Gates said he was stabbed in the thumb—M Carthy said he was stabbed in the side—we took them to the station-house Cross-examined Q How long have you been on this beat A About two months—I know the Brill public-house well—I did not know the prisoner or prosecutor before JEREMIAH LOCKABY I am a policeman I was on duty shortly before twelve o clock and saw a mob of people round the door of the Brill public-house—I went up and saw the prisoner hold up his hand and say I am stabbed —some blood was running out of his thumb—M Carthy turned round and said I am stabbed —I said Where —he pointed to his side and said Here —he was bleeding from his side and said he was very weak—I assisted him to the station-house and told the other constable to bring the prisoner—I came back to see if I could find a knife—I could not find it then as it was rather dark but as soon as it was daylight I found this penknife about two yards from where the disturbance took place—it was open and was on the step of the public-house door—there was blood on it—I saw M Carthy s jacket waistcoat and shirt—there is a hole in them just about the size of the knife—it is a very small hole—we could not find it for some time—the wound appeared about an inch in width GEORGE SIMPSON I was outside the Brill public-house I saw M Carthy come out and then the prisoner—after they were both out I saw the prisoner open something which I believe to be a knife—I went up to him and advised him to go away and put the knife away—he said he would not that if any of them came near him he would use it—the prosecutor was coming towards him—I placed my right-hand against his chest to stop him and the prisoner made a thrust and stabbed me in the hand—I went out from the crowd and heard a cry of He has got a knife he has stabbed the man —I did not see M Carthy hurt—I went away directly Cross-examined Q Where was Gates when you got the cut in your hand A Standing by the railings of the Brill public-house—I had not been inside the house at all—he did not seem to be excited as if there had been any quarrel I swear that—I did not know him before—the prosecutor was advancing towards him when I put my hand to keep him away—he did not touch him JOHN GRADY I was at the Brill public-house on the Saturday night in company with M Carthy—a quarrel took place with Gates—they had a few words inside the Brill public-house nothing more than words—it was something about pushing—I did not exactly know what it was at first—I walked out just close after M Carthy—the prisoner came out soon after—I heard nothing pass afterwards for I walked a distance on—M Carthy stopped and talked to him—I did not see M Carthy hurt—Gates and I did not have any quarrel not a word—I did not give him any blow nor did he give me any—I did not threaten to give him any blow Cross-examined Q You were the first person that had words with Gates A No I did not have any words with him at all it was M Carthy—I had nothing to do with it at that time—I have been acquainted with M Carthy a long while—I get my living by hard work—I am a labourer and work for any body that will give me work—I did not ask Gates to give me any beer nor did M Carthy that I know of—I did not bear what M Carthy said—the matter began by pushing—I did not begin the matter myself—the last person I worked for was a gentleman named Binn in Park Cottages Regent s Park—I had been working during that week not for him—I hardly know the name of the person—it was a gentleman near Battle Bridge—it was plastering work—I did not strike the prisoner myself nor see him struck—I never said I would do him any harm nor any thing of the kind JOHN M CARTHY re-examined I cannot form any judgment how deep the knife went into me—I lost a great deal of blood—my shirt was full of it—I am not quite recovered now Cross-examined Q I believe you went to the station-house charged the prisoner first and then went to the hospital A Yes—I remained there that night and came out next morning—I was not discharged THOMAS MORTON I am a surgeon at the University College Hospital M Carthy was brought there on the night of the 1st of August with a stab on the left side in the region of the heart about four inches deep but in a slanting direction—he was kept in the hospital during the night and went away at his own request next morning—the wound as it was not dangerous—the slanting prevented it—if it had penetrated directly straight it would have killed him—I should have thought it had been a larger instrument than this knife that inflicted the wound but if the knife were drawn out not exactly straight that might enlarge the wound so as to make it appear to be inflicted by a larger knife—the wound in the flesh was three or four times as large as the hole in the jacket and shirt—the aperture in the shirt is such as this knife would make Cross-examined Q If you had not seen that knife you would have supposed it to have been a larger one A Yes from the outward appearance of the wound—I see no difficulty in there being a small hole in the shirt and yet the cut being produced by the same instrument COURT Q The aperture in the shirt could not be made by a larger instrument A No MR PAYNE called the following witnesses — AMELIA SPURRIER I am single and live in Lucas-place Tonbridge-street New-road—I get my living usually by charing and other work I was in the Brill public-house on Saturday night the 1st of August—I and the prisoner went in together to have some beer with Caroline Gorman and Joseph Mitchell about half-past eleven or a quarter to twelve o clock—we all four stood together—I saw M Carthy there when we went in—as we were standing drinking Grady came up and asked the prisoner for some beer which was refused—upon which Grady smacked him in the face—the blow was repeated a second time and after that Mitchell took it up—the barman turned Mitchell out—the moment he was turned out the gas-lights were put out and the observation was made Don t put the lights out some of us will be killed —at that moment M Carthy came and caught hold of the prisoner and dragged him out of the place—we being females did not think it proper to go out in the mob and continued there till the mob was dispersed—as soon as they were dispersed a little we went out and the first cry was that Gates was stabbed in the thumb and the blood was pouring—I went to the station-house—there were several persons in company with Grady and M Carthy but I did not know them JOSEPH MITCHELL I am a mariner I was at the Brill public-house on the 1st of August in company with the prisoner and Spurrier—we called for a pot of beer between us—a person named Connor and Grady were sparring together—Grady hit the prisoner in the face—they put the gas out—the barman came and took me out—I stood outside the door three or four minutes before the rest came out—they all rushed out together—Grady had hold of one collar of the prisoner and M Carthy the other and they shook him—when they came outside M Carthy struck the prisoner and they rushed into one another—I cannot say which used the knife—I saw no more of it HENRY BRETT I am in the coal line I was in the public-house and saw the prisoner and prosecutor there—the prosecutor said Are you going to stand a pint of beer —the prisoner said No I amn t—he instantly up with his hand and gave him a smack on his mouth and kept pushing him to insult him—they put the lights out and bundled them all out together—when they got out they got fighting together—the prisoner said By G—you have cut my thumb off and the prosecutor said You b— you have stuck me —I said to the policeman Take them both and you are sure to have the right one John Ayliff a bricklayer and John Stokes labourer gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 19 —Recommended to mercy

had on WILLIAM THOMPSON I am a surgeon and live in Lambeth-walk On Sunday night the 2nd of August Cullen was brought to my house between twelve and one o clock—he was literally covered with blood—on

outer plate of the skull was as if you had taken a saw and made a groove in it—part of the bone was coming through the orifice—I washed him and sent him home—I attended him—inflammatory symptoms arose in about thirty-six hours and he had erysipelas in the face all over—his life was undoubtedly in danger—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by this poker—I considered his life in danger

but I am not certain On Saturday the 22nd of August be came to the premises—I had let a person out of the shop—when I let him out the prisoner rushed into the shop from the street—there is a little

the street—I bled a good deal—I got my wounds dressed at a surgeon s—I had not had any quarrel or dispute with the prisoner—on the morning before he met me in Seven-dials and said he wanted to have two minutes conversation with me but I did not stop to speak to him because Mr Martin had told me if I met him in the street I was not to speak to him—I had not been concerned in any way in his being dismissed—I never had a quarrel with him to my recollection in my life—my uncle told me not to speak to him because he was such a man he would be very likely to ask me to get him back again MICHAEL

dagger in his hand using it it in this way— stabbing —this is the instrument—I ran up stairs for assistance and when I came down the prisoner was going out into the street and he was concealing the instrument up under the sleeve of his coat SAMUEL MOYNIHAN I live in Little Wild-street—I am an apprentice to Mr Martin Carroll called out my name and said Come down for God s sake here is Pat

was bleeding from the arm—I saw the blood through his shirt—the prisoner had got an instrument like this concealed behind his arm—I could just see it as he stood—he had it in his hand when I came out and when I looked at it he put it up his sleeve—I went for a policeman but when I returned he was already in custody JOHN WICKINS I am a basket-maker and live in Little James-street Covent-garden On the 22nd of August the prisoner came to me and wanted to borrow an iron to make a hole through his basket-bottom—I showed him one first—he did not like that and I showed him this one—he said that would do—I gave it to him and he went away with it—I saw no more of him till he was in custody—I told him to bring it back within five minutes because it was not my own but one of my shopmates —he said he would bring it back in five minutes—I know this to be the instrument—half an inch has been broken off the point and it has been ground down again in our fashion it was not sent to the grinder

have done very wrong I am free to confess it I meant for three days to murder him and thank God I have not killed him —he said he had deprived him of his bread—I cautioned him against making use of such words and asked if he had not been drinking—he denied that he had and repeated the same words again six or seven times—it was about nine o clock in the morning—I received this instrument from some person at the station-house—the prisoner said when he saw it Ah that is it Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Was it on his repeating the same thing over and over again that you asked if he had been drinking A It was on his repeating it the second time—he seemed in a great state of excitement so much so I thought he was in liquor—there was no smell of liquor about him LIONEL JOHN BEALE I am a surgeon and live in Long-acre On Saturday the 22nd of August Hood was brought to me about nine o clock in the morning—I examined his left arm and found three punctured wounds about half an inch

arm as well as before Cross-examined Q All danger is quite at an end I should hope A Quite so—there was no danger from the actual wounds—he might with the same instrument have killed the boy James

t18410405-1082  1082 EMMA HARLING was indicted for that she on the 12th of February upon a certain female child now deceased feloniously did mike an assault and did attempt to suffocate and drown it by casting and throwing it into the soil water and filth of a certain privy with intent feloniously wilfully and of her malice aforethought to kill and murder the said child MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution LYDIA LEMOYNE I keep a ladies school in Canonbury-lane Islington The prisoner was my cook—on the 23rd of February a little after eight o clock in the evening I saw her in the kitchen sitting by the fire complaining of violent pains in her back—I spoke to Mr Semple a medical man who happened to be in the house at the time—I went to the privy which is in the garden immediately after speaking to Mr Semple and saw some ashes or mould had been recently thrown down on the soil—I had a candle with me and besides the mould there were two or three garden-pots or parts of garden-pots thrown there—I beard no noise—I then came back into the house and went to the prisoner with Mr Semple—she was still in the kitchen—Mr Semple asked her if she was in the family way or had been so—she denied it—he remarked some appearance of blood on her arm which she said was occasioned by salting some beef which I contradicted as I had salted it myself—she complained of being very unwell and very sick—Mr Semple said she had better confess—she said she had nothing to confess—I saw part of the floor of the kitchen had been recently washed between where she sat and the door—her sister was in my service as housemaid—after this conversation I went to the privy again with her sister and then heard the cry of a child in the cesspool—I immediately called Mr Semple who accompanied me to the place and with some difficulty extricated a female child with a pair of tongs—I thought it was dead but Mr Semple restored it by means which he used—I had seen two baskets of cinders in the scullery that day and after this search I saw one of them was empty Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q How long had she been in your service A Nearly twelve months WILLIAM SEMPLE I am a surgeon and live at Islington I was at Miss Lemoyne s house on the night in question and at her request went down into the kitchen to the prisoner who was sitting by the fire in a state of very considerable exhaustion—I examined her externally and found some flabbiness about the abdomen—I saw a good deal of blood on her arms and suspected she bad delivered herself—I asked whether she had been in the family way and whether she was married—she said No —I said I suspected she had been delivering herself and it would be well if she would say and she had better say so to her mistress as something might be done thinking the child might be in the house but she said No —I afterwards went to the privy and took the child out—it was a female—I found it lying partly on its back and partly on its side the legs only were seen above the soil the head and upper part of the body were buried with the ashes and mould—it was apparently dead but I had heard an indistinct moaning before I took it out—I used a warm bath and friction and ultimately restored it—I found the placenta in the cesspool just by the child—the umbilical cord was torn—Miss Lemoyne asked the prisoner in my hearing if she knew why the mould and ashes were thrown down—she said she had not thrown any down for many days before—this was before the child was found Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q Have you had much experience in delivering women A I have—I never knew of a woman being delivered involuntarily and almost unconsciously but have heard such a fact I believe it sometimes does occur in small abortive children—I have known instances of delivery so rapid that persons have been unable to obtain assistance in time—I can suppose there may be sensations previous to delivery very similar to an inclination to go to the closet MR BODKIN Q Was this a full grown child A Yes ELIZA HARLING I am the prisoner s sister and housemaid to Miss Lemoyne On the evening in question I noticed my sister going to the privy twice—I had no reason to believe she was in the family way—I did not see any thing come from her in the kitchen—that evening I saw some blood on the floor—I did not see where it came from—she was before the kitchen fire at the time—the blood was against the kitchen door—I cleaned it up—nobody desired me to do so—I knew my sister was ill but did not know what was the matter with her—I asked her she said she should get better and did not tell me—I saw her carry some ashes in a shovel that evening out at the back door which leads to the privy Cross-examined Q You never had reason to suppose she was in the family way and you slept with her every night up to this time A I slept with her MISS LEMOYNE re-examined I always thought the prisoner extremely kind to children but I have none under my care under twelve years old—I have seen her very kind to the children at my house occasionally ROBERT SEMPLE I am surgeon of the parish of Islington I saw the prisoner on the Monday following the Saturday in the workhouse—I examined her person—in my judgment she had recently been delivered of a child—she was then suckling the child—I attended the child until its death—it lived about eleven days—its death was owing to diarrhoea and had no reference to what had taken place—on the morning I saw her suckling the child I told her it was a sad business—I cannot take upon myself to say what she said—she did not say much—she said the was single JAMES FINK I am a policeman I was called to Miss Lemoyne s house on the 12th of February and found the prisoner in the kitchen about a quarter to ten o clock—I went to the privy and saw some garden-pots and a quantity of cinders and mould on the surface of the soil—I took the prisoner and child to the workhouse that night—the prisoner told me when I found her in bed at the house that it was her child and she had dropped it in the privy—I asked her if she bad thrown it in or dropped it—she said she had dropped it in MR CLARKSON to ROBERT SEMPLE Q Did she appear to treat the child with kindness until it died A Yes—she herself required about three weeks medical attendance MISS LEMOYNE re-examined I found no preparation made for a child—no linen or clothes at all ELIZABETH HARLING re-examined I did not throw any of the ashes or mould or pots into the privy GUILTY Aged 23 —Recommended to mercy — Transported for Fifteen Years 
t18410614-1798  1798 RICHARD POPHAM JOHN M PHANE and WILLIAM DONOGHUE were indicted for feloniously assaulting George Watmough on the 17th of May and cutting and wounding him with intent to kill and murder him —Three other COUNTS stating their intent to be to disable disfigure or to do him some grievous bodily harm MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecutor GEORGE WATMOUGH police-constable L 105 I hare been an officer for some years On the 17th of May I was on duty in Hooper-street Lambeth—between eleven and twelve o clock I was walking towards the Farm House beer-shop there—I had heard there had been a man robbed of his watch there and was going towards the house to make inquiries—about ten yards before I got to the house I was met by the prisoner Popham who I saw come from a house of ill-fame opposite—I knew his person—he came up to me and said You b— you shall never reach the house and instantly struck me a violent blow on the side of the face with his fist—I had offered no violence whatever to him either in language or act—after be struck me I endeavoured to seize him—he was making his way towards the door of the Farm House—I laid hold of him and struggled with him in the course of which he knocked my hat off with a life-preserver which begot out of his left-hand breast pocket—he then made another blow at me which cut me just above the temple on the left-side—it was a very heavy blow—it cut my head and blood followed—I still kept my hold of him—he made another blow at me—I caught the life-preserver with my right-hand and saved the blow—I continued to struggle with him and whilst doing so I saw the prisoner M Phane come from the beer-shop—I knew his person—he drew something from his pocket and struck me a violent blow on my cheek just below the temple which felled me to the ground—it appeared to be another life-preserver—that was whilst I was straggling with Popham—the blow was on the same temple—it tore my cheek and fetched blood—I still had hold of Pophara and we both fell together—while I was on the ground I received another blow from M Phane which took effect on the arm and made me leave go of Popham—I should say it was with a similar instrument to the one I had taken from Popham—it was not his fist it was something more heavy—as I was raising myself to get up I received a blow on the hand from M Phane—I was then attempting to seize him—Popham had got away from me—the blow cut my finger in two places—he struck me two or three blows on the hand—while endeavouring to secure M Phane Donoghue came up—Popham had then got away—M Phane only was with me—I saw Donoghue come from the beer-shop while I was on the ground and he kicked me very violently about the body—I was not struggling with M Phane at that time—I could not lay hold of him because of the blows on my hand—he was going away at the time Donoghue came up—I did not get hold of M Phane at all—Donoghue did not make use of any expressions at the time he kicked me—he kicked me several times—I also knew Donoghue s person well—I was exhausted with all this beating and they all three got away—I was not able to seize Donoghue from the state in which I was—I was on the ground about five minutes after they left me before I was able to help myself—I then got assistance from Jones 141 L and went with him to the Farm House where I took Donoghue into custody—he was standing at the bar when we went in—as soon as he saw me come in he ran into the tap-room and hid himself behind the door—after securing him I went with Murphy to the lodging of M Phane in Short-street—I observed there was a light at the lodging which was extinguished as we went in—I went into the second-floor front-room and found M Phane there in bed—I took him into custody and told him what I took him for—he said I knew I should be nailed for this—I shall only be fined—if it is 5l I can pay it or if it is 10l I can pay it —I did not myself take Popham—a warrant was lodged for him at another place next day—we found where he was in about a fortnight in the City—he has been brought here by Habeas to be tried—here is the life-preserver which I took from Popham—I went to Mr Wagstaff the surgeon and he kept me off duty for five days—I felt very weak—I lost a deal of blood—for seven days after that I was only on reserve duty at the station—I have entirely recovered now Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Do you mean to persist in saying that you knew Popham before A I do—I did not take up another man instead of him—I took up one Matthew Allen because he said I should not bring Donoghue out of the house—he was discharged—I did not take him up in mistake for Popham nor was he discharged in consequence of not being the person nothing of the sort—I seized Popham as he was going towards the beer-shop—that was after he had struck me the blow with his first—it was in the midst of the struggle with him that he struck me with the life-preserver—M Phane and Donoghue asked the Magistrate if they could be allowed bail—bail was not taken—Popham was never before the Magistrate at all—he was in the Compter for an assault and was brought here to take his trial without going before the Magistrate—M Phane was not admitted to bail because the security was not good—the Magistrate agreed to admit him to bail—I found Donoghue and several other persons in the beer-shop—I did not find any person who had stolen a watch—the struggle with Popham was on the pavement opposite the beer-shop door close by—no one came out of the beer-shop at that time but M Phane Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q How was the man dressed who came up and struck you with a life-preserver A Popham was dressed in a brown cord jacket—it was just after Popham and M Phane left me that Donoghue came up and kicked me—directly Donoghue came up M Phane ran away—he did not come up while I was struggling with either of the others but afterwards—Hooper-street is a close confined street—there is no great deal of light—there are only two lamps in the street—I was about seven or eight yards from the beer-shop at the time Donoghue came up to me—I was then lying on the ground exhausted and very faint—I was unable to rise—I lay there for about five minutes—when M Phane and Popham came up there was not a rush out of the beer-shop—I was about ten or fifteen yards from the beer-shop when Popham first came up to me—there was not a number of persons came out of the house at that time not till after I sprang my rattle Cross-examined by MR CHAKNOCK Q How long have you been a policeman A Nearly five years and a half—I have often been a witness—I was never a prosecutor before—this occurred about half-past eleven o clock—I am quite certain about the time—it was a little girl that came out of the house who told me a felony had been committed at the beer-shop—she is not here—she was a perfect stranger to me—she did not see transaction—she was about one hundred yards from the beer-shop—there were no persons present at the time the prisoners assaulted me not a soul—that I swear positively—not near me—William Cotterell was there and when I called on him he ran in doors and shut the door—he was not there at the time of this assault—he was standing at his own door when it began—he did not remain there above two minutes before he shut the door—he shut the door before I was struck with the life-preserver—as soon as I received one blow from Popham s fist I went up to him—Cotterell might have seen that blow for what I know—he did not see any more that I know of—I cannot swear he did not see the striking with the life-preserver—I do not know of any one else being present—I will swear William Herring was not there—I was sober—I am positive as to the identity of M Phane—I know him well—I am positive he was the second man who assaulted me—it was a darkish night—I was twenty or thirty yards from the gaslamp—M Phane was dressed much the same as he is now for what I know—he might have had that coat on or something similar to it—I cannot say whether he had a black or blue coat on or a black or white handkerchief or what kind of trowsers he had—I did not take that notice—I have not sworn that he had corduroy breeches on—I went to the beer-shop as soon as I got assistance from a brother-Constable—I remained at the beer-shop about two minutes—after lodging Donoghue at the station I went direct to M Phaue s lodging—I knew where he lived—when I went into his room the light was out and he was in bed—this is not the first time I have stated the expression M Phane made use of—I stated it at Union Hall I swear that—the charge there was an assault—I did not lake up any one besides the prisoners and Allen—I took Allen for bringing Donoghue out of the beer-shop he was not charged with this offence—I am quite certain of that MR CLARKSON Q Who is this Mr Cotterell A He lives at the house adjoining the Farm House beer-shop—if he had come forward to my assistance when I called him I could have secured two of the prisoners if not the three but he went in and shut the door—I have known M Phane these five years JOHN LOADER I have charge of the Farm House beer-shop for Mr James Silverthorn the landlord—he does not live there—I am put in to manage it—we have a tap-room On the night of the 17th of May there was a row in the house about half-past eleven o clock about a person losing his watch—I saw Watmough about twenty minutes after that bleeding—he came in for some persons who had assaulted him—the three prisoners had been in my beer-shop that night—they went away about half-past eleven—Popham went out first M Phane next and Donoghue last Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q Were there a number of persons in the beer-shop that night A Yes from seventy to eighty—I had very great difficulty in clearing the house—I turned them all out as fast I could Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q What time did Popham leave A It was about twenty-five minutes to twelve o clock I should say when first missed him about that within a minute or two—I am quite certain M Phane did not leave prior to that—I am able to tell the time each man left because I never left the tap-room from the time of the first alarm till I cleared the house—I take notice of these characters—these three and several others belonging to the gang—I do not keep a house for the reception of improper characters—I want to get rid of them as fast as I can—I am doing all I can towards it—I did not see the policeman struck—I saw Popham attempting to force his way into the door and Watmough would not let him—I saw them struggling together—M Phane had on a sort of blue trowsers and a black or blue waistcoat I think—there were a great many persons present at the time I saw the struggling—I was not outside the door but I could see a great many persons standing outside the house WILLIAM JONES I am a policeman I was called on on the night of the 17th of May and rendered my resistance to Watmough—he was bleeding from the head very profusely and when I first saw him he was just rising from the ground—I afterwards accompanied him into the beer-shop to take Donoghue—after putting him into the station Murphy accompanied Watmough elsewhere and M Phane was afterwards brought to the station—I am well acquainted with the prisoners persons PATRICK MURPHY police-constable L 24 I went with Watmough from the station to take M Phane into custody—I observed a light in the room before we entered it was put out as we approached the door—we went in took him out of bed and brought him away—I was not acquainted with the prisoners persons before this MARK WAGSTAFF I am surgeon to the L division of police and live in Walcot-place Lambeth On the 17th of May Watmough came to me about half-past one o clock in the middle of the night—I observed a good deal of blood about his head a cut on the left-side and the head and face altogether a good deal bruised—he appeared to have lost a great deal of blood—his cheek was slightly cut—from the appearance he presented he had decidedly been much beaten—the cut on the head was very near the temple—I consider it a dangerous spot for a man to receive a blow—I think it a blow very likely to have been inflicted with the life-preserver produced—it was not a sharp cut—I anticipated concussion of the brain—I kept him off duty for five days and he was seven days only on reserve duty—the reserve duty does not come under my direction—if the blow had been on the temple it would have been very likely to have deprived him of life Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q That is to say if it had been struck somewhere else it would have been very dangerous A Yes it is not always the wound that produces the danger but the consequence of the blow on the brain—I consider that the same effect on the brain might be produced by the blow taking place where it did as if it took place on the temple—the blow may be given in one part and the mischief in the brain may be in another part—you do not have mischief in the brain immediately after the blow—it was the parietal bone that was struck just over the left temple—concussion of the brain does not follow immediately on the blow—sometimes it is a day or two after and sometimes a fortnight—the symptoms I mean—the concussion takes place at the time but the consequences may not be apparent for a fortnight—there was no concussion in this case—there was nothing to induce me to believe there was concussion—the man was very much bruised Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q How long was he under your care A Five days—I kept him quiet and gave him saline draughts—I do not consider there was concussion here—such a blow would be likely to produce it—concussion must of course take place at the time the blow is given—I have known concussion of the brain produced by a blow in the position I have described—I recollect several persons being brought in while I was at the hospital where concussion had been produced by such a blow as this not from a life-preserver Witnesses for M Phane MARGARET COONEY I am the wife of Thomas Cooney a cooper in Short-street Tower-street—M Phane lodged with me for nine months On the night of the 17th of May he came home in his usual manner about eleven o clock or a little after I cannot say to a minute or two—I that was generally his usual time—he was dressed in blue trowsers and a frock-coat blue I think but I cannot be positive although I have seen it repeatedly—it was the one he has always been in the habit of wearing at my place—when he came home he retired to his room—he was perfectly sober when he came in—I heard no more of him till a quarter to twelve when I heard a great noise going by my door—I opened the door and saw my brother Matthew Allen in custody with Watmough and several more of the police and they were beating him very cruelly—I cried and made a great alarm and went to the stairs and cried out M Phane came down immediately and hallooed out What is the matter is there a fire —I said No but my brother is gone by with the police oh dear what has be done —I called M Phane down by name as my husband was not in-doors at the time—he came down in his trowsers and stockings and no shoes and went out as far as a ditch at the corner of my place—he met with a person and said What has Matthew Allen done —he said He is taken into custody for beating the police —he returned and told me and said Never mind don t fret it will only be a fine in the morning —he then returned to his room and I heard no more of him till a quarter to one as near as can be—several of the police then came to my door and knocked at my shutters—I and my husband were in bed—my door was fastened—I asked what they wanted—they said Open the door or else we will have it open —I wished them to tell what they wanted—I heard them say Bring the crowbars open the door or we will have it open immediately —I said Don t burst open my door I will open it who is it you want —they said Make haste —I got up and opened it and the police all rushed in with their staves drawn—I saw a person named Chapman outside the door—he is always in company with the police—I heard Chapman say He lives in the second floor front room—go straight up and I dare say he is at home now for I saw him some time ago at the corner of the ditch —a great many policemen went up into the room and Chapman and a policeman staid down at the door—I was too flurried to count how many went up stairs—I heard M Phane say he was in bed—the policeman said Come get up —he said What for what have I done —they said they would soon let him know when they got him to the station—I heard every word that passed except what was said in the room—I could not hear that—M Phane never said I shall be nailed for this but I shall be only fined 5l or if it is 10l I can pay it —I am confident he never made use of any such words or any thing like it—he only kept saying what had he done or what was he taken for—they then took him away MR CLARKSON Q How many persons lodge in your house A There are four families—there are no women—I heard Watmough say when he went out just now to speak to the solicitor that I kept a house of illfame—I have six rooms—I live in the parlour—that is my sleeping room as well—my husband came home about half-past eleven o clock that night—I cannot say to twenty minutes—he came home before M Phane was taken and before he went to bed—not before first let M Phane in when I gave him the lucifer and candle—I swear that—a shoemaker and his two children live in the first floor—M Phane and his wife live in the second floor—he came to me as a married man—I cannot be answerable for it—I cannot tell how he has got his living—his grandfather is a hatter in Gloucester-street and he has worked for him—I went there as a reference—he keeps a hatter s shop there—I do nothing for my living—my husband keeps me—he is in the employ of Noble and Rolls varnish manufacturers and has worked for them nine years—M Phane first came home about eleven o clock or a little after—I have a clock hanging up in my room so I of course could notice the time—know by the time he came in and the time I had my supper it could not be more than eleven or a little after—it was a quarter to eleven when I sat down to have my supper—my clock is always going—I wind it up night and morning—I am confident it was right because my husband comes home regularly to his meals and I am obliged to have it hit—he comes home to breakfast at half-past eight to dinner at one and to tea about seven and then he does not go any more to work—I do not know where he had been that night—I did not ask him—I did not look at the clock when M Phane came in—I did about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards—it was then half-past eleven—I did not go before the Magistrate—I intended to have gone—several of the persons went to speak on my brother s behalf and I was going to speak for him and M Thane but was too late the case was heard—my brother lives at No 24 Cheston-street Cheston-square very near me—he is not here nor is my husband—I know the Farm House beer-shop—I have been there for years—I was not there that night—I was there in the morning—I left about six in the evening—I went there I dare say about five or a little after five after my brother and sister who were there—it was a little after eleven when M Phane first came in and a quarter to twelve when I called him up—the police came about a quarter to one as near as can be—I stood at the door when he went to the corner of the ditch—the ditch is not five steps from my door—I stood at the door with the door in my hand till he came in—when my brother went by in custody I made a great alarm—I did not particularly call M Phane—he came running down hearing my noise and asked what was the matter—any other of the lodgers might just as well have come down as him—they might well be alarmed for the police beat my brother so cruelly—the shoemaker on the first floor looked out of the window—no one else came down but M Phane—ray brother did not bleed at all—he complained of his chest where they beat him and they rushed him against the posts at my door and Watmough stated that he was positive my brother was the man that struck him—I heard him say so down at the hall—he said to me What have you come down here for —I said I have come down to see about my brother —he said Your brother won t be hurt—I shall not hurt your brother —I was summoned here by that gentleman the prisoner s attorney I have seen Popham before not at my house—I have seen him at my door—he has not been in my room nor in my house only at the door—I am quite sure of that—I cannot tell whether he was an acquaintance of M Phane—he must have been—it was not after me or any one belonging to me that he came—when Popham has been to my door it was after M Phane he has come—I cannot tell how often he has been there—not three or four times a week—I have not seen him twenty times nor half twenty—I will not say how many times but I know he has not been twenty times—I know Donoghue perfectly well in the neighbourhood—he knows M Phane by sight but as to being any companion of his or not that I cannot swear—I nave known Donoghue from his birth pretty well and I know M Phane never associates with him—I am confident of that—I do not know M Phane s associates but I know Donoghue is not an associate of his—my brother went to school with Donoghue and when they come home from work they are generally together—I believe Donoghue has been in custody for felony—I have no doubt about it—I know it perfectly Well—he was brought up a very good steady boy—he ought to have been so—my brother works hard for his living—he has never been in trouble nor any of our family—I never knew M Phane before he took my lodging—his wife came after the room—I cannot say how soon it was after M Phane came that I saw Popham—he was a long time there before I saw Popham—I have not known Popham—he is an entire stranger to me except seeing him at my door—I never saw him at my door before M Phane came there nor any where else—I should not have known him from Adam and I am sure I do not know him MR CHARNOCK Q You have no interest in the question A Not at all—my husband works hard for Ms living and all my family—I live by his industry—mine is a respectable house—there is no ground for saying it is a bad house—I believe M Phane to be married—they always conducted themselves very properly while with me—the shoemaker is married and has two children—the person in the back room is a widow—my clock is a Dutch one I do not intentionally keep it wrong—I keep it right to be prepared for my husband s meals—as far as I know it was correct at that time—I can be on my oath that it was JURY Q At the time you let M Phane in had you a candle alight in the parlour A Yes—when he came in I gave him a short bit of candle—the wick was rather damp—I attempted to light it but said Here is a couple of lucifers you can manage to light it yourself —I put out my candle when my husband and I went to bed—I cannot tell what time that was I was so worreted at my brother being taken—I dare say I was in bed about half an hour before the police came—it was precisely a quarter to one o clock when they came to the door—Mthane came down in consequence of my making the noise—I did not exactly call him by name—my husband was in the house then but he is a very timid man and had been ill previously and when he heard the noise of the police at the door he trembled and shook like a leaf WILLIAM COTTERELL I am an equestrian performer and live in Hooper-street next door to the Farm-house beer-shop On the 17th of May I heard a disturbance there and went to my door to sec what it was—the row was inside—Watmough came up and stood alongside of me—I did not say thing to him or he to me—I only stood by him—I saw a man with no hat on and Watmough laid hold of him pulled him out of the door and told him to go about his business—he had just stepped in at the door—that man was dressed in a corduroy suit but I cannot say I could swear to him being in the dark—he burst away from Watmough and got into the house again—Watmough followed him dragged him and pulled him out and then a scrummage took place between the pair of them—they both clung together—this was somewhere about half-past eleven o clock as near as I can say—I did not see what the parties did to each other—I did not interfere in it because I am a cripple and an invalid—I did not go in and shut the door—I saw the finish of it—Watmough fell down—I saw him rise up with some blood running down his face—I saw no blow—Wat-mough cried out that he had struck him with something—there were many neighbours and persons present besides me but no one interfered with the policeman except that one man—he knocked the policeman down some-how or other—they rolled over one another and the man got up and ran away from him—I am quite certain the man was dressed in a corduroy suit rather dark—I do not know M Phane at all—I never saw either of the prisoners before—M Phane was not there nor Donoghue—none of them were there—only one person interfered with the policeman during the whole of the time—I picked up the policeman s hat and held it for him—since this the policemen have called me up I stated what I had seen and they then said they did not want me—I have not been subpœnaed by the police I have by the other parties MR CLARKSON Q Do you keep any horses A No—I do not go to fairs—I am with Mr Ducrow and so forth—I am not in any engagement at present but my father is and I live with him—he has an engagement with Mr Ducrow as an equestrian—I swear he is a performer and so am I—I have performed with many companies—I have been with Batty s-circus but am now a cripple from the rheumatism—Watmough called out Cotterell assist me —I did not immediately run in and shut my door—I was there all the time—I stood in the crowd but did not interfere at all I was not able—it is twelve months since I rode on horse-back—I was performing abroad six months ago on the slackrope—I do not know Mr M Phane at all only from seeing him pass up and down the street two or three times—I did not speak to him—I have lived on my friends for the last six months not being able to do any thing—know nothing of the prisoners—when Watmough called to me I went to his assistance as far as I could—I picked up his hat and held it for him MR CHARNOCK Q There were a great many persons there A Yes—if any one has said there was nobody present that would not be correct—about six months ago I broke a blood-vessel and that brought me home WILLIAM HERRING lam a cabinet-maker and live at No 32 Hooper-street On the night of the 17th of May about half-past eleven o clock I was up at my window and saw Watmough coming down Hooper-street towards my house talking to three young girls—I told him he would soon be wanted there being a disturbance at the Farm-house—Watmough replied that he was going down to the Farm-house—I saw him go and followed him—he did not go into the Farm-house he stood at the door till the party ran out in the attitude of fighting—the party then waited in the road and wished to go in again—Watmough pushed them from the door—I was standing with Watmough watching the parties—the party that ran out rushed right by Watmough and went into the house again—Watmough went in after him seized him and pulled him out—they scuffled across the road till they got to one of the small houses—Watmough then struck him with his rattle—T did not exactly know that person I never saw him before that night—it was neither of the prisoners—the man was dressed in corduroy or fustian I do not know which—it was not M Phane—he was not there—a scuffle ensued and the man that was struck with the rattle I believe knocked off the policeman s hat as near as I can recollect—they scuffled a few minutes—I was behind Watmough at the time—he called on me—they fell and I saw the man hitting the policeman with something in his hand—I do not know M Phane more than passing up and down the street I have no intimacy with him—he was not at the spot at all neither did he strike the policeman for the party that did so was a great deal taller—there was only one person scuffling—was applied to by Wat-mough to give evidence on the part of the prosecution—I told him the evidence I could give—he said I have got the right two have I not I said No you have not —I said I should speak the truth when I went up to Horsemonger-lane where he told me I was to go—he told me to prepare myself for Monday—he has not subpœnaed me—he threatened me at Horsemonger-lane if I appeared here—he took me into a little room put his finger up and said You had better mind what you are about or you will get severely punished —I told him I could not be punished for speaking the truth—that was all he said MR CLARKSON Q Who do you work for A For shops in general—I have manufactured ever since I have been out of my time—I have a small house—I cannot say whether Popham is the man Watmough had the scuffle with I should not like to say—the man was much taller than M Phane—Popham is a little taller than M Phane—I have lived in Hooper-street two years—I do not know Mrs Cooney except since she has been with me to Horsemonger-lane—I was never at her house no more than I might see the prisoner s attorney there—I cannot tell what day that was—it was the time the trial was to have been on at Horsemonger-lane—I should say it was a month or six weeks ago—I cannot call to mind the date—I was never there before I swear that—I have been since—I was there this morning—Mrs Cooney came down for me—I know Mrs Yellady by being a neighbour—I was never in her house—she lives right opposite Cotterell—I saw her last yesterday afternoon—she was talking to my wife at our door when I went home—I believe her husband had been illusing her—I went to the Farm-house beer-shop that night—after the policemen were there not before—there was a disturbance at a club there—I heard a little bit of a riot and went down similar to my neighbours—I did not know what it was about—they seemed all fighting together friends and foes—I have never been in any trouble POPHAM * Aged 23 — GUILTY on

the neck and left cheek with intent to do him some grievous bodily harm JOHN SULLIVAN I am a labourer and live at No 1 Burford s-court—the prisoner lives at No 6 in the same court and a man named Timothy Driscoll also—I do not know that he is related to the prisoner—last Sunday week I went to Timothy Driscoll s between twelve and one o clock at night—he is my wife s first cousin—I was not paid my wages till eleven o clock—I found the prisoner and him there and both their wives—we had some beer there—I had some—I and the prisoner talked about scholarship—he was talking about a brother of mine—I said my brother was five years at school and learnt nothing—the prisoner said all the scholarship my brother learnt was from Mr Townsend who was a gentleman in Ireland my brother lived with—I said Mr Townsend never sent for my brother to send him to school —the prisoner then called me a liar I believe—I took my band up with my fist closed and was going to strike him but his wife up and shoved me down—she was standing close by me on the second step of the stairs—she shoved me down on a bed which was lying down and as soon as I recovered myself and got up the prisoner came and cat my throat—I did not see any thing in his hand because he stood so high and his wife was between him and me—I very nearly bled to death—I did not faint away or lose my senses—I got just outside the door and got to my own place—I went to catch bold of him after I was struck to see what he had in his hand but he went up stairs directly—he lives in the top room—I got out and got home—the doctor was sent for—I did not fall against any glass—when I went towards the stairs to lay hold of him his wife and another laid hold of me and they shoved my arm through the window —I am sure the window did not cut my head it was done before Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q How far is the window from the bed A About four feet—I am sure it was after I had been cut that my arm went through the window—the cut was behind my ear—when the prisoner s wife shoved me down she pushed me by my breast—I was thrown down sideways on the bed—there was beer on the table when I went there—there was no bread and cheese—they were not eating any thing—I eat nothing in the house—there was nobody in bed—Catherine Donovan was there—she lives in the middle room—she is not here—she is Timothy Driscoll s wife not my brother s wife—there are two Mrs Driscolls—I cannot say whether Catherine is the wife of the prisoner or Timothy—both the wives were present—neither of them were in bed at the time—the bed was only kid down—the prisoner and I come from the same county in Ireland—I have known him since I have been a child—I did not know the prisoner was in the house when I went there—it was Timothy I went to gossip with—I was quite sober when I went—I had received my wages at a public-house and had a pint or two of beer—I had no gin —I had been at the house about half-an-hour before we began to talk about the scholarship—I drank two tumblers of beer there—there were not above two pots COURT Q What do you labour at A I was a navigator—we sometimes get paid as late as eleven o clock and at public-houses MARY DRISCOLL I am the wife of John Driscoll I am no relation to the prisoner—I live in the same court—I know Sullivan and his wife—we are old friends—on the night in question I heard his wife call out Murder —I went in and found Sullivan bleeding—he appeared to be sober—I sent for Mr Tatham the doctor—I was at the Thames Police office and heard the prisoner say to his wife that he hoped he should get over it as he had the misfortune of doing it but he would make some of the b—s swing the rope JOHN WELSH I am a policeman I was in Burford s-court on the night in question—I went up stairs to where Sullivan lived and saw John Sullivan sitting on the bed bleeding—I came down stairs made inquiry and went to the prisoner s room at No 6—I found him standing up with this piece of iron in his hand—I said You are my prisoner —he said Very well whatever was done to Sullivan I done it —he was sober—I searched him but found no knife in his possession—I did not search the premises—I saw Wood on the floor of Timothy s room down stairs Cross-examined Q Did he not appear as if he had been drinking A No he did not—I did not sec the signs of any liquor on him—he was sober—he might have been drinking I cannot say—he appeared to be sober not to have been drinking—he made no resistance CHRISTOPHER TATHAM I am a surgeon I was called in to see Sullivan on the 15th of August about three o clock in the morning at Burford s court—I found him seated on a chair in his house—he appeared to be very much excited—a wound was inflicted on the left side of the neck five inches long about half an inch below the ear extending from the side of the neck on to the cheek—it was more than one inch in depth—there had been considerable hemorrhage from the appearance on his clothes but when I arrived it had ceased—he appeared considerably excited as if he had been taking liquor I should think beer—I did not smell any spirits—he was not intoxicated—he was quite capable of knowing what he said and did—he appeared to be agitated by passion—I dressed the wound which had extended through the carotid glands under the ear and the external carotid artery was laid bare but not divided if it had been I consider he would have been dead before I could have arrived—he has been under my care ever since—there is now every appearance of his doing well—I should say decidedly it was what is termed an incised wound such as a knife or razor or some sharp-cutting instrument would make—it could not hare been inflicted by any thing else—it was quite a clean cut the edge was not jagged at all—I put four sutures into the wound Cross-examined Q Might not that wound have been caused by a broken piece of glass if he was thrown violently on it A No I do not think it could—a wound of that description could not be inflicted by a point of glass—if the edge of the glass against which he was pushed was proportionate to the length of the wound that might account for the appearance COURT Q Would it have done so if the edge of the glass was of the common thickness of a pane of glass or must it be sharper than that A I do not think a piece of glass would have cut the wound so clean the edge would be more ragged and I should have found some small pieces of glass adhering to the edge—I should say if the prosecutor had fallen down on glass in that position it might have produced that wound but not by falling against a pane of glass in a window GUILTY Aged 30 — Transported for Fifteen Years

the Prosecution ELIZABETH SARAH MAGNESS I am forty years of age and am the wife of Thomas Magness I fill the situation of upper bar-maid at the Auction Mart hotel—I was there for eleven months before this happened—it is an hotel behind the Auction-mart in Bartholomew-lane and communicates with it—the lower part of the hotel is called the tap and that part is under my management—Mr Baker is the keeper of the hotel—the prisoner was potman at the tap—he had been there five months—I noticed that his behaviour was very cross on the Sunday previous to the 12th of Dec —he has attempted to kiss me and I rebuked him for it—I have heard that he is twenty-one years old—he went by the name of John in the establishment—the housemaid is called Ann—on the evening of the 12th of Dec she complained in his presence that she and John had been locked in the cellar—I took no notice of it—it was afterwards mentioned to me that John and her had been in the bed-room together—in consequence of that about a quarter to nine o clock when the prisoner came into the tap I told him he had better be minding his work than playing—he said he had not been playing—I said it was false he had—I said he had better be clearing his tables that I had been clearing them all day and he had better be clearing them himself—that was part of his duty—I told him he was in the cellar just now referring to what I have mentioned—he said it was not his fault—he did not say he locked the door—somebody locked him in I believe—when I scolded him he seemed very surly and sullen—he cleared the tables and after that he sat down on one of the tables—there were customers there and he waited on them—the sulky or sullen appearance continued—I had occasion to go past where he was sitting and he said something to me—I did not hear what it was—I felt offended—I thought he was jeering me and I called him a forward vagabond—later in the evening he came to the bar for some porter which he took out to a customer—when I spoke to him I scolded him about his work and he said Go to heaven with you —he was not long gone with the beer—I saw him come back—nothing more passed after that till Ann called him—she said Mrs Baker wants you —it was about a quarter or half-past nine o clock—he left the tap in consequence of that and remained away till about eleven o clock which is the time we usually begin to prepare to shut up—it was his duty to shut up the shutters—I desired him to be called for that purpose—Sarah another servant called him—I did not hear him answer—he did not come—I rang for him—I did not hear him make any answer to the bell and at half-past eleven as he did not come I proceeded to shut up the shutters myself—I did not fasten the door as there was still some customers in the house—I came in again and attended to them—I returned to the bar—the customers did not stop long—they only came to the bar and had what they wanted—there are two gates outside the house—I proceeded to lock them at about a quarter to twelve—there are steps and a sort of iron railing—the whole is below the level of the street down in a sort of area—I was fastening the right hand gate first inside intending to come back—I had gone up the steps to get to it—a young man a customer who had been in the house seeing me come up the steps came and asked what I was doing—I could not find the right key and he helped me—I had never fastened the gate before—he was not on the outside—he had been having something to drink—he did not go outside—another door is left open till twelve and when he did go he went out that way—while I was fastening the right hand gate at the top of the steps the prisoner came half-way up the steps as if to help me fasten the gate—I told him I did not want him—I said I had done the rest part of the work and I could do that—he said Go to hell with you went down the steps and stopped at the bottom—after I had closed the gate I came down and the customer who had helped me came down with me—we passed the prisoner standing at the bottom of the steps and went into the tap leaving him there—I served the customer with liquor—while he was drinking it I observed the prisoner come in—he said nothing—he passed through the tap and went in a direction that would take him to his bed-room which is on the same floor as the tap right facing it at the left hand side of the building about the middle of it—there is a door going out of the tap—the bed-room is not behind the bar—as you stand at the bar you can see his bed-room—it is on the other side of the building a very little distance from the bar just across the passage—there is the mart door about the middle of the passage at the back of his bed-room—it was not my duty to fasten that door it was his duty but I went to do it—I took the key with me and a light in my hand—when I got into the passage to fasten that door I observed the prisoner towards the right sitting on a pair of steps which were there—I went down the passage in a direction from where he was sitting leaving him behind me—as I went along I heard something behind me and felt both his hands behind me one on each shoulder—he did not say anything—I pushed him from me and said Be quiet sir or I will call Mrs Baker —I proceeded to put the key in the door to fasten it—I was quite separated from him at that time—I heard something click and just as I was in the act of turning the key I felt myself shot—I heard a report as of the discharge of fire-arms—I heard the click as I was putting the key in the door—it was followed by the report instantly—I fell—I did not lose my senses at first I fell on the ground immediately it knocked me down—my falling with the candle in my hand put it out and the place was in darkness—before I lost my senses I heard him say Woman what have I done —after I laid there two or three minutes I got up—it was after I became insensible immediately after he said Woman what have I done and he fell down near me—I had said nothing thing myself before he used that phrase nor at any time before I lost my senses—before I became insensible I felt something trickling in my hand—it was afterwards found that it was blood—upon that I became insensible for a minute or two and then I got up—I do not recollect rising but I found myself on my feet again—I left the prisoner on the ground I think—I went to the tap—I believe I tried to open the door to get into the street but could not—I forgot I had locked it—when I turned round from the door I met the prisoner—there was a gas-light there which reflects inside and gave me an opportunity of seeing his person—I put my hand to my side and said What have you done —he stood firmly fixed before me with his right arm up with a knife in it—he said Now I ll finish you —there was blood on the knife—I put my hands together and said For God s sake spare me and rushed past him screaming Murder —when I left that spot I was again in darkness—I did not fall during my progress—I scrambled along the wall and eventually succeeded in getting up to my bed-room which is along the passage and across the yard in the upper part of the same building—the prisoner followed me—as I was going along he said For God s sake stop and I will not hurt you —I think those were the exact words or Come to me and I will not hurt you —he said it more than once—that was while I was going along the passage—it was all dark there—I got into my bed-room—he came up after me—I hid myself by the side of the bed and heard him say Where is she —the room was in darkness—he was in the bed-room at that time—soon after that the house was alarmed a medical man was sent for the police came in and the prisoner was taken Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did you not represent yourself at the time you took the situation at the Auction-mart as a widow A Yes—from anything that I can tell the prisoner did not know that I was otherwise—he did not appear to be very partial to me in particular not more than he was to the rest—he did kiss me once and then I pushed him from me and said Be quiet —he has attempted it several times and he has others the same—he never succeeded but once and then I scolded him for it—I do not know how long before this 12th of Dec it was that he first attempted to kiss me—not long before this occurrence—I think one night when Mr Baker went out to dinner—it was my brother Mr Moton s birthday I and one of the other females sat up for him—that was the time he succeeded in kissing me—he had not his arm round my waist on that occasion—I swear that—he put his arm or elbow on my shoulder—my back was to him and I instantly pushed it off—Sarah was with me—she was at the side of the fire-place—she was sitting on a chair—I believe her eyes were shut—I do not think she was asleep—I am sure she was not—I never had a picture a likeness of myself—a young person I know named Jones had—she was not in the house—she called there—I believe she asked the prisoner if he would fetch the likeness for her—it was being repaired—I did not hear her ask him—I do not know that any body asked me for that picture unless it was her—she asked me for it—I said I had not got it John had got it COURT Q How long was this before the 12th of Dec A I cannot tell—about three weeks before MR PAYNE Q Did you give him some money to buy a scarf which he wore round his neck A Never in my life—I never heard of such a thing—he wore a scarf round his neck—I swear I did not give him the money to buy it—he did not make me a present of a pair of boots—he bought a pair for me but he had the money for them—I gave it him—Henry was to have fetched them—there was a conversation in the house about something having happened with the prisoner in my bed-room—I never spoke to the prisoner privately about the reports—I was in a passion when I spoke to him—the 12th of Dec was on a Monday and about a month or five weeks before that when I heard of this I made a complaint to the prisoner—I did not cry—I went up stairs to put my dress on on Thursday morning and Sarah told me what Mary should say—I said I would not put up with that—I came down stairs stopped in the bar a few minutes spoke to Sarah on the subject and told her it was a scandalous shame—I went out of the bar and was running across the lobby and saw the prisoner there—I was going to open the parlour door to speak to somebody in the parlour about it and he would not allow me—I said How dare you sir say I opened the door and let you out of the bed-room —he said he did not say any such thing—I said I will not have my character taken away by such apoor beggarly wretch as you —he was going to say something to me and I said Don t talk to me you beggarly wretch don t and I left the place—I made no complaint to Mr or Mrs Baker about this during all the time between this and the 12th of Dec —I spoke to him again about it at night in the presence of Sarah—I do not recollect that he said the best thing I could do was to tell Mrs Baker and she would discharge him—he might have said so—I never told him I would not tell Mrs Baker—I did not have another conversation with him on the same subject a few days before the 12th of Dec —I never spoke to him after that Thursday night—I do not think he has made attempts to kiss me after that—I swear I have not allowed him to kiss me frequently since that time—he never told me that what with my fretting and the others talking about this it would drive him out of his mind—he did not stab himself in the breast in my presence with a knife—I swear I never had any conversation of this kind with him after the one on Thursday the month before—I never had any private conversation with him at all—I had no conversation with him on the night this happened—I did not tell him then that I had disgraced myself through him and that my brother would hear of it—I never told him any such thing—when I was in the passage previous to being shot he did not put his left arm across my neck—he only put his two hands on my shoulder—I believe he kissed me then and that made me push him away—I felt his face or his head at the side of my face and I pushed him from me and said Be quiet sir —he did not kiss me and say he had come to take leave of me for ever—he never opened his lips—he did not kiss me—he put his face by the side of mine and I pushed him from me on the instant—it was not at that moment that the pistol went off—he put one hand on each of my shoulders in this manner—I do not know where the pistol was at that time—I did not feel it against me at all—he did not turn my head round at all and put his lips to my face—I never saw his face—he did not put his head over my shoulder and put his lips to my face—he put the side of his face or head against the side of mine and I pushed him from me—when he said Now I ll finish you he was standing directly opposite to me—when I turned round from the street door that I was trying to get out at he came after me—he was before me at the entrance to the tap—he was in the tap and I was in the tap Q What was there to prevent his carrying his threat into execution if he ever meant it A I put my hands together and rushed past him as he was just coming to plunge the knife into me—I will swear he said Now I will finish you not Now I will finish it —that was after I was shot but I had my senses—there was nobody else there at that time—he never said to me that he wished he was in heaven and I was there with him—when I got up stairs I found my clothes on fire from the pistol—I am confident the prisoner did not help me up off the ground when he said O woman what have I done —I laid there a few minutes—as soon as I was up I left him laying there—I hardly remember rising but I know I got up by myself—I said I am on fire put it out when I was up stairs—he was not near me then—he was down stairs—he was not in the room then—he might be coming up the stairs—I knew afterwards that the blood trickling on my hand came from his throat—it was not blood from myself—I suppose it most have been from his throat—I know Mary Jones—she has been living in the service of Mrs Baker twice—she came the second time five or six weeks after I did—she slept with me—she was living there at the time this happened—it was on the Thursday after the Monday that he got in at the window that I first heard of his being in the bed-room with me—that was about a month or five weeks before the 12th of Dec —I did not say anything about what had been said to Mr or Mrs Baker because Mary the kitchen-maid begged and prayed of me not—she is the person who slept with me—I do not think they call it a recess that is in the room—it is an awkward made room—the other bedstead stands exactly opposite ours—you might reach one from the other—I was awoke in the night by Mary Jones saying the window was open—she did not say there was somebody in the bed—I did not say it was all nonsense—she never said there was anybody in the bed till the Thursday after the transaction—I got out of bed—after that Mary Jones got out and got a light as I could not find the lucifers never having occasion for them myself—I was sitting in the bed when she said there was somebody under the bed—she begged of me not to say anything about bis being found there—she said Mrs Baker would think he came in to rob the house if I said anything about it—she said For God s sake don t say anything about it Mrs Baker is such a very suspicious woman —I did not say to her Don t say anything about it —I never in my life gave her anything to drink not to say anything about it—I never thought of such a thing—when I complained to the prisoner of his having been locked in the coal-cellar with Ann he said it was no fault of his he did not lock the door—that was when I was in the tap scolding him—after that I was friendly with him with respect to the business—I spoke to him concerning the business but nothing further no further than I could help—I did not speak to him for two days after the Monday not the next day and very little the day after he was found in the bed-room—on the third day after I heard what I did I called him a beggarly wretch—he begged my pardon and said he would never do it again—Sarah was in the tap-room when I scolded him on Thursday night and I said it was a planned thing between Mary and him—I should think Mary is as old as myself—I scolded him several times for being so much in the kitchen and neglecting his tap-room—I have not seen him take any liberty with Mary—I was never in the kitchen—my husband was in the habit of coming there while I was there—nobody knew he was my husband—I think the prisoner spoke to me one day about the man that used to come to see me two or three times a week—he said one day Do you know the person that is there —I said Yes I know him —he said I dreamed last night that he stabbed me —I did not tell him that he was my husband—he knew I knew him by speaking to him—this was more than a week before the 12th of Dec —it must be more than two or three months I should think—I cannot recollect I am sure MR BODKIN Q What was your motive in representing yourself as a widow when you applied about the situation A Mr Baker wanted a bar-maid—I went after the situation for my daughter who is turned eighteen—I saw Mrs Baker—she asked who it was wanted the situation—I said my daughter—she said she was too young she would rather have such a person as myself—I said I should be very happy to serve her as I intended going out when my daughter went out—as I came out she said I suppose you are a widow —I said Yes as I thought my having a husband would be objected to—my husband is very much afflicted and I thought it would do him good my going out—there was a picture in the possession of somebody I knew—it was not Jones who was in the establishment a different person altogether—on one occasion she had asked the prisoner to fetch the picture—I had nothing to do with his having it—I did not ask him for it—I knew he had got it because I saw it—I knew he went for it from the shop—it had a new glass put into it—she thought I had got it and came to me for it—the prisoner and Henry were allowed to go out on errands for me—I never went out but once in three months—I asked Henry several times to get me a pair of boots and he did not—the prisoner was going out for oil one Saturday night and he said he would bring them in and he did—the room I slept in is up one flight of stairs—Sarah and Ann sleep in the other bed—Ann has left—Sarah is here—on my oath I did not know of the prisoner s being in the room—I was no party to his being there and had no reason to expect him there—Mary Jones was in the bed and the other two in their bed—when I was locking the door on the night of the 12th the prisoner put his hands flat on my shoulder—I am sure at that time he had no such weapon as a pistol in either hand—at the moment I pushed him from me I went to put the key into the door and when I had put it in I heard the click while I was putting it in and as I was turning the key he shot me—the moment he said Now I ll finish you I rushed past him and screamed Murder SELINA CUSHWAY I was called Sarah at the Auction-mart tap—I had been there about nine months as under barmaid under Mrs Magness—I remember the night of the 12th of Dec —Mr and Mrs Baker and the family were gone to the theatre—about twelve o clock I was with Mrs Magness in the bar—about eleven o clock she told me to call the potman Cannell to shut up the shutters—we used to shut up the shutters about that time—I went and called Cannell—I found him in his bed-room—he said he was coming—he did not come—Mrs Magness went out after that to put the shutters up herself—she went to fasten the outer iron gate—the prisoner went out after her—I remember after that her going to secure the mart door in the passage—she took a candle with her—I saw the prisoner follow her and soon afterwards I heard Mrs Magness say Be quiet leave me alone —it was in a middling tone between a good-natured and an angry tone—it appeared in an angry tone then—in about a minute or two I heard the report of a pistol and heard Cannell say O woman what have I done —I got out of the window and ran for the police and a doctor—I was very much alarmed—a policeman got in Cross-examined Q Had you heard about ten o clock that evening anything said by Mrs Magness to the prisoner about Ann the housemaid A Yes she scolded him—he said Ann had no business in his room and it was not his fault—I afterwards saw him in the scullery—I said Why did you try Mrs Magness when she was in anger —I meant tried her temper—I was afraid Mrs Magness would be angry and tell Mrs Baker and then she would be angry with him—he said I wish I was in heaven and Mrs Magness was with me —I do not know that Mrs Magness is of rather captivating manners—I had seen the prisoner kiss her about three or four times—the last time might have been about three or four weeks before the 12th of Dec —I remember the rumour about the matter in the bed-room—it was about a fortnight before the 12th of Dec MR CLARKSON Q Have you any means of fixing accurately the time whether it was a fortnight or more A No I have not—I have seen the prisoner actually kiss Mrs Magness three or four times—she always told him to be quiet—he once attempted to kiss me—I never saw him try to kiss Jones—my bed was close to Mrs Magness s—Mrs Baker is not now ill in bed—she is not confined to her bed COURT Q Are you living there now A Yes I saw Mrs Baker up this morning—she is a very old woman WILLIAM BAKER I keep the Auction-mart hotel—my wife might be able to come here as a witness if it was particularly desired but I can bring a certificate from my doctor—she is very unwell very nervous and in very infirm health Cross-examined Q How long was the prisoner in your service A Five or six months—he was with me for a fortnight before and came back to me—he was the best servant I ever had in the house JAMES SMITH I am waiter at the tap of the Auction-mart coffee-house—I go by the name of Henry there—I remember the talk in the house some time ago about the prisoner being in the women s bed-room—the prisoner gave me an account of it a few days afterwards—he told me he went up to the window out of a joke to see them get into bed and that after they were in bed he lifted the window and got into the room that he fell asleep by the side of the bed and might have slept two or three hours—when be awoke he endeavoured to leave the room but the door was fastened—in endeavouring to open it the noise awoke Mrs Magness and the kitchen-maid—they got out of bed to see if there was any person in the room—I am not positive whether he said they both got out or only one at all events the kitchen-maid got out lit a candle and closed the window when he saw that that was the case he got under the bed that the kitchen-maid fancying she heard a noise the second time got out and found him in that position—he said neither Mrs Magness or any one else was aware he was in the room till the noise awoke them Cross-examined Q You had spoken to him about it I suppose A I had—we were on very friendly terms—we never quarrelled the whole time he was in the housr—he did not appear more partial to Mrs Magness than servants should be—I was more in the bar than any other room by Mrs Baker s desire MR CLARKSON Q Did you observe any improper familiarity on Mrs Magness s part A Not the slightest to any of the servants MR PAYNE Q You did not sleep there did you A No I sometimes sat up for Mr Baker when he was out and sometimes slept there—my time of leaving depended on the time the customers went HENRY CHAPMAN City police-constable No 648 On the 12th of December about midnight I was on duty near the Auction-mart tavern—I heard the report of a pistol or fire-arms and in about two minutes I heard a female crying Help help —I went near and found Cushway standing opposite the door of the Auction-mart tavern—in consequence of what she said I got into the house at last by the door being opened by Mrs Baker—I went through the further end of the coffee-room—I called out for the prisoner—I ultimately found him on the top of the stairs and took him into custody—he said Here I am here I am what have I done what have I done —I then apprehended him—he said at the bottom of the stairs What a coward I must be to shoot the woman I love and that has been so kind to me —I had charged him with shooting at Mrs Magness but said nothing to induce a conversation from him—he attempted to tear his heart out—he appeared to be very much excited Q In what way did he attempt to tear his heart out A By putting his hand into his waistcoat and saying Could I but tear my heart out and he pulled his hair violently—when I got him to the foot of the stairs he fell—I then saw he had cut his throat—I said You have cut your throat —he said Yes I have —I immediately sent for a surgeon—after giving him into the charge of Edwards I went to see for Mrs Magness—the prisoner said she was up stairs—I saw her in the bed-room in the arms of a person who was supporting her—I returned and found the prisoner in Edwards s custody—after his throat was dressed I asked him where the pistol was—he was on a form in the coffee-room—he said he had thrown it down in the passage—I went to the passage where I saw the blood and found the pistol—a little further on in the passage I found a razor-case four or five yards from the pistol—I then went to search the bar which is about four yards from where I found the pistol and razor-case—I found a knife on the bar counter open and wet with blood—I returned to the prisoner—he said while in the coffee-room Take the razor from my pocket—I have a razor in my pocket —I saw Edwards take a razor from his right hand pocket wet with blood—this now produced is it—I produce the pistol razor-case and clasp-knife—as we went through Bishopsgate-street to the station he said O that woman that woman —I took him from the station to St Thomas s Hospital and remained with him all night—he told me he had bought the pistol in Little Bell-alley for the purpose of shooting cats and he had shot one about six weeks previous and during that time the pistol had been loaded in his bed-room—he said be could not account where his senses could have been to have hurt the woman he loved that she was in the act of locking the door when he drew out the pistol and shot her that he immediately cut his own throat and they both fell to the ground together Cross-examined Q You sat up with him at the hospital at night A Yes two nights—I had no more conversation with him—he was very restless indeed all the first night—there was no one present except the nurse when he made this statement—she was not near the bed—he said he had dreamed on the Friday night before that he had shot the same woman and he little thought he should have done so in reality—he said she was very obstinate and would not let him fasten a gate—I did not write down the conversation—the conversation about buying the pistol in Bell-alley was the first night and about shooting her and their falling together on the Tuesday—he was not restless all the night but till about midnight—he made the statements to me during the time he was very restless—he said Betsy seeing herself on fire got up and ran into the bar and said For God s sake put the fire out —that he got up and ran after her and she cried out Loosen my stays —that he drew the razor for the purpose and on that she became frightened and got away from him—he afterwards cried bitterly and went off to sleep—I was with him from five o clock in the afternoon till eight in the morning but not in the day time—I asked him once whether he wished to make any confession if he did I would send for the surgeon that it might be taken down—he said he should not say anything about that till he knew the fate of the woman MR CLARKSON Q What he said was on Tuesday night was it not A Tuesday night or Wednesday morning—I never used any threat or inducement to him to converse with me—he said it of his own free will—the way he talked induced me to say if he wanted to make a confession I would send for a surgeon—he said he would not say anything about the provocation he had for doing it till he heard the fate of the woman—I am quite certain of that JAMES JOHN ADAMS I am the medical person who attended Mrs Magness on the night in question—I found her standing partly leaning against the bed—I caused her to be undressed and examined the wound—there were two wounds one at the upper edge of the eighth rib on the right hand and the other on the left side opposite the cartilege of the sixth rib about two inches below the heart but that would vary in different individuals—I do not remember to have seen a pistol or gun-shot wound before but I believe it to be so—I did not see the ball found in ber stays—I picked it up myself—I have applied it to the pistol—it appears to be a rifle-ball—this ball would have inflicted the wound—it must have passed through her body from the back to the left side about two inches below the heart—I believe the lungs to have been perforated—such an injury is very dangerous to life—she continued in imminent danger till the middle of Thursday the 18th—when she recovered a little I had some account of the transaction from her—I had a conversation with the prisoner about it—I said nothing to induce him to make a confession to me nor threatened him if he did not—I requested to know if two balls were in the pistol or not—I asked him if he had ever any connexion with Mrs Magness—he hesitated and replied No —I requested him to be careful what he said not to injure her character as he had endangered her life and before he answered me any question not to be in a hurry—I cautioned him before he answered any question—he said that he withdrew a step when close to her and then fired—he gave me no account of what led to this transaction Cross-examined Q Was that all he said A All that I can remember at present—I had heard something said that might affect Mrs Magness s character before I went to him at the hospital—not from him but generally—I did not go for the purpose of asking him whether he intended to confirm these rumours—I was not desirous of doing so—when I went there I asked him if he would answer my question—he said Yes —I said You have nearly taken the life of Mrs Magness don t ruin her character —he said he went to kiss her and she pushed him away and then he stepped back and fired—that did not occur to me before—I did not write down my conversation with him at the time—I went to inquire whether there was wadding in with the ball—I had heard something said that might affect the character of Mrs Magness and was desirous of knowing-whether he intended to confirm the rumours—I asked him if he would answer my questions—I said Relate to me all that happened at the time meaning at the time he shot her James Goff landlord of the Cherry Tree in Kingsland-road John Bly Kingsland-road and Richard Hooper

- s son I was in a great passion I went down stairs she took the two bricks laid them on the bed and told the policeman I had beat her with them she took a fork out of the cupboard and struck me with it Witness I did not take a fork nor lay the bricks on the bed—he was passionate and I suppose I was the same as him MARY PYBUBN I was living in the same house as the prisoner and prosecutrix—he was out all night on the 25th of March—the prosecutrix came down and let him in in the morning—when he came up he began to ill-use her—I went up and saw her sitting on the floor by the bed—she was bleeding at the mouth and was very much bruised about the forehead—I told her to go down stairs and have nothing more to do with him and told him not to ill-use her—he went towards the fireplace took a brick and struck her on the head with it—she was doing nothing to provoke him—I cannot say whether he was drunk—I endeavoured to prevent him—I followed her down stairs—I went and got ray gown on and when I returned I found her lying on the flags of the pavement outside—I did not see whether he touched her hair or not—I left the room—I persuaded her to go down stairs—he followed her down Prisoner I went down to go to my day s work I did not know whether I had better go or not I was so much in a passion this woman does not well like me and she is belying me Witness I am telling nothing but the truth—I have had no quarrel with him—I never had a word with him JOHN CANTWELL police-constable K 220 On the 25th of March Pyburn came to me and I and a brother constable went to a house in West-court St Ann s-place—I went up stairs and saw the prisoner on the further side of the room—his wife was lying on the floor—there was a brick on each side of her—on one was some blood—I gave him in charge to a brother constable and fetched a doctor—I took the prisoner to the station and asked him how he came to ill-use his wife—he said by C—t he only wished he had killed her dead and likewise Mrs Pyburn he would sooner go and be hanged by the neck that morning than he would go and do a day s work—as I was coming over the Britannia-bridge he said if he was taken and had a month for it he would have his revenge when he came out Prisoner I never mentioned such words I said I did not know whether to go and do a day s work or not as I was so much in a passion Witness He did not say that CHARLES MATTHEW WAITE I am one of the house pupils at the London Hospital and lodge in Mount-street On the 25th of March the prosecutrix was brought to the hospital—she had a severe contusion on the forehead and a lacerated wound at the back of the head—the scalp was cut and it penetrated to the skull—the bone was not fractured—the lacerated wound was such as the side of a brick might inflict—it was rather a sharp wound not very jagged—the wound on the forehead was such as the flat side of a brick might make held in a man s hand and struck with violence—there was danger from the wound from a fear of erysipelas and inflammation of the brain—it was what I should call a serious wound—it was impossible to say at first what turn it might take—I considered her in danger so far as all wounds in the head are dangerous—it in some measure depends on the degree of violence with which the blow was inflicted but not entirely—these wounds were such as that erysipelas might naturally follow—I should describe the injury as a severe contusion and a lacerated wound—it did not produce concussion—I should say she had decidedly received a grievous bodily hurt Prisoner s Defence I never hit her with the bricks they picked them off the fire-place and put them there and said I had thrown them I was afraid of staying there that night for fear she should stick me through with a fork I do not expect that any woman who broke her own mother s legs with a mallet would have much luck ELLEN DONOVAN re-examined I did not break my mother s legs with a mallet—I can swear that—he knows nothing about my mother—she has been dead and buried six years—he is a villain—he was the cause of killing three children one after another in my womb—he never gave me a meal s victuals for three months—the neighbours gave me a crust of bread—he would go along with girls of the town to public-houses come home call me out of my name and be ready to stick me with a knife—I never injured or struck my mother—I have been married to the prisoner six years and sorry I am that I ever saw the vagabond—he is a great murderer and I should like him punished—I have no children—I had three by him but through his kicking and cutting me about he killed them in my womb one after the other and this is the first time of my giving him in charge and I should not have given him in charge now but for the woman in the same house MR WAITE re-examined I did not examine her ribs as she did not complain of them GUILTY Aged 25 — Transported for Fifteen Years

the prisoner till I saw him at the station—I afterwards observed that something had gone through the door Cross-examined by MR WILKINS Q How near were you to him when he presented the pistol at you A one yard—I then ran down a passage—the hole in the door was somewhere about twenty-four or twenty-five inches from the ground—I do not know that it was only eighteen inches—I have not measured it—I have known the prisoner some years—I did not know him when he was a courier—I do not know that he had been in the habit of carrying pistols in his pocket—I had formerly occupied the premises on which these fixtures were and when I left I left the fixtures there—I did not on the 17th of Jan break open the shop-door with the assistance of two bricklayers nor the bakehouse-door—I did not give

purpose of removing what you considered your property A Yes COURT Q That was what you were disputing about A Yes—the bargain was that they were to be left there to remove at my convenience CHARLES

prisoner—seeing them running I was somewhat surprised—I followed and the prisoner fired the pistol—the prosecutor had retreated towards the yard door before that—he closed the door on him and the pistol was discharged by the prisoner—I saw the pistol in his hand—I just laid my hand on him and a policeman came in—I went to the yard door and said The prisoner is in custody and then followed to the station—the pistol was fired as the door was in the very act of closing—to the best of my belief the prisoner was about three yards from the door two or three yards I did not measure JOHN MILLER police-constable C 14 I was in Silver-street on the afternoon of the 26th of Jan —I heard a report as I supposed of fire arms—I went to the spot from whence it came and saw the passage full of smoke—the prisoner was pointed out to me as the party who discharged the pistol—I took him to the station searched him and found an unloaded pistol in his right hand coat pocket and in his left hand coat pocket I found a loaded pistol—I drew the charge before the Magistrate—it was loaded with the powder and ball which I now produce Cross-examined Q Have you measured the height of the hole in the

sitting in my own room and heard the report of fire arms—I immediately ran down stairs and saw the passage full of smoke—the prosecutor was in the yard—on searching the yard I found this ball lying on the stones about two inches from the door outside—I found a hole in the door through which the ball had passed in the bottom panel—I compared this ball with that hole and it exactly corresponded

half from the edge COURT Q Does the door extend all across the passage A Yes—I should say it is between three and four feet wide JOHN MILLER re-examined The passage from the front door to the back is

not allow me—I told him I had some work to get ready for a customer—he said he did not care for customers he would not allow me to leave the room—the work was for a person who was going out to tea—I told him I wished to go home to get it ready—he said I should not—Mrs Miller said she would give me needle and thread if I would do it there—she did so—he took the band-box from me with the work in it—I asked him to give it me back—he said he would not let me have it except he got to my lodgings—I asked Mrs Miller for a pair of scissors to cut the trimming of a cap—the prisoner took a pair of

pair—he then put them into his pocket—Mr Miller was in and out of the room and Mrs Miller was there all the time—the prisoner wanted me to take him to my lodgings—I said as I had been before a

wished me to go—the prisoner asked me to go into the back room and talk with him—I did not wish—Mr Miller came to me and asked me to go again—I asked him to go and talk to him and while he was talking

public-house at the corner of the street where I live—he said if I would not come to him he would buy pistols and blow our brains out—I left and came as soon as possible to the place which was the Magpie and Stump—I found him sitting there with Mr Miller—he said v had been to let some person know he was coming—a quartern of rum was called for—he desired me to pay for it which I did—they had been drinking before v went in—I had a little of the rum—the landlord cleared the house as it was time for afternoon service at Church—the prisoner told me to lead the way—he wanted me to take him to

twice and at the third blow I became insensible—he had struck me on the temple—I felt the blood spring from my head through my right ear—when I recovered he had got me on the other side of the room—he had dragged me from one side to the other and was jumping on my breast with his feet and beating me on the head occasionally—he said he had come to do for me—he gave no reason for this except saying Miller was my fancy man—I was too much beaten to recollect what he might say but I recollect his coming forward with a pair of scissors—I put up my hand and the scissors cut my finger and went through my lip—I became insensible and when I came to myself the floor was covered with blood—my head smarted very much I felt it bleeding very much and became quite blind—he shook me and told me to look up—he said You are not dead yet —some time afterwards he called me an ugly name and said Look up here is your child —I said I could not see my child—he said You shall never see it more till you are in

purse when I went there which was about halfan-hour after I left home—I do not remember seeing the prisoner at all till I saw him coming out of the station—I lost my purse—I cannot say how I lost it—the last time I had it safe was ten or twenty minutes after six in the morning—I was then at the Alfred s Head near the Elephant and Castle—I had been home at night and been to bed and had got up—I am sure I had my purse then—I was not sober enough that night to remember what I was doing—I remember having it at that time but I do not remember how long I had it after—I was taken to the

in the London-road—she was tipsy—she fell down—she got up and crossed the road—there was a mob of persons—the prisoner and another young man were there—the prosecutrix went down a court and the prisoner and the other followed behind her—I followed and looked on—when they got down the prisoner asked her if she had any money—she said she had—he said Let me look at it —she put her hand down her bosom and took out her purse—she emptied the money from her purse into her hand and the prisoner tried to snatch it from her—she held her hand tight—the other man then asked her to come in doors—she said No —the prisoner took hold of her threw her down and tried to take the purse from her hand—she held her hand fast and then he hit her in the face with his fist—she was lying on the floor in the

that court—that was the first morning I had been to work at that place—I had the prisoner in my charge and collared him—I should think this lasted altogether four or five minutes—there were houses up the court but they are of a bad sort—there were not a great many persons going by the court that morning—this happened in the centre of the court RICHARD JARVIS cabinet-maker Elizabeth-place Between eight and nine that morning I was going to the Borough—I passed the Alfred s Head public-house—I saw the prosecutrix and the prisoner and two other men together about nine o clock—I saw the prisoner

married to him—I live at No 5 Brown Bearalley East Smithfield and keep the house—it is a house of ill fame Last Wednesday week he came home in the evening—he said no more than asking if I had done tea—I made him no answer—he then upset the tea table and struck me with his closed hand on the forehead more than once—they were hard blows—he pulled me off the sofa on the ground then kicked me on the side and on the breast—I do not think he did anything else to me while I was down—I do not know whether he jumped on me—I was senseless and when I came to myself he was not there—he hit me very hard—while he was doing this he used very bad expressions not fit to mention calling me ugly names but nothing more that I know of—I did not hear him say anything about my life or say what he would do to me—I sent for a policeman—I cried out before I became senseless and sent my servant for a policeman in his hearing and he said he would leave me so that I could not tell a policeman from anybody else—he went to the door then came back and hit me with his hand more than once—he went to the door more than once and on each occasion returned and beat me—the policeman came but he was then gone—he returned to the house at half-past nine o clock and I then left the house directly—nothing passed—I saw him again at half-past eleven as he was going into my house—I sent for a policeman and gave him in charge—I found myself very ill soon after and took to my bed and was in bed ten days—I am now getting better but am still in a weak state—the prisoner and I had had a few words a week before but I had not spoken to him for a week till this time—we had separate apartments during that time—w neither ate nor slept together for a week GRACE RUMMER I am the prosecutrix s servant On the night of the 4th of Aug the prisoner came home—I heard him ask mistress whether she had done her tea—he then upset the tea tray over her and began to ill use her with his fist hitting her over the temple and face—she was sitting on the sofa at the time and by his ill using her she fell down—he still kept hitting her with his fist and kicking her body about her side—when he began kicking her she told me to go for a policeman—I did not hear him say anything more than I will kill you —that was while he was ill using her—I returned without a policeman and found the prisoner still there—I had been gone ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he was still kicking and beating her—I went out again but returned without a policeman and found mistress sitting alone—the prisoner was then leaving the house—mistress was in a very bad state—about an hour after that the prisoner came in whistling—he said nothing—I suppose he was half an hour ill treating her WILLIAM BROWN I am a surgeon and live in East Smithfield I was sent for to attend Murray about seven o clock on the evening of the 5th of Aug —I found her in a state of insensibility arising from the ill usage the had received—I could not make anything of her for some time—I could not get her to answer a question till she was copiously bled—she then began to recover—I applied leeches and put a plaster on—she was in one mass of contusions all over her head and body and the extremities as if she had been very severely beaten and her head and chest jumped on—evidently on her chest—there was a small superficial wound on her temple—I rather think that was done with a blunt instrument either by her falling or the heel of a shoe—it was through the skin—I found no other wound—there was an excoriation on the other side—I should not call it a wound—her breast bone was very much swollen for two days it was very difficult to say whether it was fractured or not—her side was very much bruised evidently by kicking and from the appearance a severe kicking Q Were there such injuries as in your judgment endangered her life A I think so certainly—she continued in a dangerous state for seven days and has not recovered yet—mischief might ensue yet from the internal bruises she has received—internal mischief might ensue—the lungs might probably become affected—the wound on the temple was of the smallest consequence—I is quite well now JOHN BURKE I am a policeman On the 4th of Sept about eleven or twelve o clock Murray gave the prisoner into my custody—her face was cut and her hands very much swollen—there was a small cut over her eye—it was not bleeding at the time—it was red—I asked the prisoner Did you strike her —he said No Prisoner I am very sorry for it I was intoxicated at the time GUILTY on the Second Count Aged 24 — Transported for

Prosecution ROBERT HANNANT police-constable N 325 I have been in the police force eight years—about the 15th of Sept I was instructed by my sergeant and Mr Risley to watch one of Risley s fields at Winchmore-hill Edmonton—I went there a little before two o clock in the morning and placed myself in a tree in the field—I had been there an hour and a half or more—there were cows in the field—about twenty minutes to four o clock I saw the prisoner come towards the tree where I was within six or seven yards of where I stood—he was in his police clothes—he was a policeman at the time and was on duty near that spot in the road about 120 yards from the spot in the field where I saw him—the cows were lying within thirty yards of me—he turned to where the cows laid—he put one of them up and drove it towards the fence—I saw him stoop towards the cow as if in the act of milking it—it was a dark morning but the cow was white—I stepped up nearly to him and heard as if milk rattled into some vessel—I think he saw me for he got up from the cow—I approached him and said Harvey you villain what are you about —he said What do you mean and at the time I heard something rattle behind him in his pocket as if it was milk—it was the noise of something running down on the ground—I flew to get hold of it—I went up to him and got hold of his hand which was behind him—he had his great-coat on which had pocket behind—I succeeded in getting hold of his hand and felt it was wet—he tried to trip me up—we had a scuffle and both fell—I was on the top—I succeeded in taking a bottle from his great-coat pocket—it contained milk—being white I could see and it was warm—while he was on the ground he said Hannant for God s sake forgive me I know I am guilty forgive me for the sake of my wife and dear children for God s sake forgive me —I said I could not—he then asked me to let him get up which I did—I had hold of his collar—he asked me to take hold of his hand which I did—he asked what I intended to do with him—I said I would treat him as I would anybody else—I shifted my hand from his collar to his wrist and while in the act of putting the bottle into my own coat pocket he attempted to get from me—my hat came off in the struggle and he struck me a violent blow two or three times with his stave—the first blow was on the top of my head—I found myself stunned and lost my sight with that blow—I could not hear or see—I shifted my hold then and got hold of his collar—he struck me two or three times—I think I recollect his Have breaking—I think then we went on the ground but I lost my recollection for a time from the effects of the blow—when I came to my recollection I was up and had hold of him by the collar and he was biting my hand to get clear from me—here are the scars now—I felt my head and felt a hole in it and the blood was running from all quarters of my head—I said Harvey you villain you have murdered me —he said No I have not leave go of me and lay on my coat —he was then in the act of getting his coat off and threw it down on the ground asking me to lay on it—I said No Harvey I will never leave you while I have life —I called Murder and Risley s boy William came to my assistance—I told him I had caught Harvey milking his master s cow and asked him to assist me—Harvey said No I have caught Hannant meaning me—we took him out of the field into the road to Risley s house the boy holding him with me—when we got near the house the boy let go to undo the door and Harvey made another desperate effort to get away—he dragged me along six seven or ten yards trying to get away—I have measured it since and it is fourteen yards—assistance came and we got him into Risley s house as the boy came back—Risley came down and we got further assistance—I got exhausted and was obliged to sit down—Risley fastened the door to keep him in—I said in Risley s presence Harvey how could you serve me in the way you have done —he said B—y into you it serves you right you are always after me you have always been watchine me or dodging after me when you have no business or some such words—Mr Cresswell the surgeon afterwards attended me—I was not conscious of anything but the stave being used till I was stripped in the house—I then said he must have stabbed me and found I had been stabbed in each arm and on looking at my coat I found it was stabbed through—I had also one wound in my throat others on my head and face and one right through—I could put my tongue through one—I had a stock on—Mr Cresswell my wouds—I was carried home afterwards—I gave the bottle of milk to Mrs Risley—I had a stave in my hand a little before the prisoner came into the field and after I got into Risley s house I think the prisoner said Where is your stave —I looked for it and could not find it—I did not use it at all in the struggle—I never could have strength for I was stunned from the first blow Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You say he took off his coat A He had his coat on one arm and said No I have not lay on my coat —I recollect his throwing it down but not his taking it off—I believe he was either taking it off or had it on his hand—I may have said he was taking it off—in the state I was in I was not confident—he had it on when I first saw him—I cannot tell whether it was buttoned up—I know Durance a policeman—he did not come to my assistance—he came to Risley s house afterwards I believe but I was exhausted and insensible then—I believe I saw him—I have no doubt there was a conversation between him and the prisoner but in the state I was in I have no recollection of what occurred—they were talking together—the prisoner has been four years and three quarters ters in the police I believe—not so long as I have—that was the first morning I had watched the field—I am generally employed on Winchmore-hill and the green lanes—I am on the same beat occasionally—I cannot tell what became of my stave—I have no recollection of feeling for it when I was struck—I have since seen it at the police-court—I will not undertake to swear I did not strike him but I never struck with my staff—I came from Norfolk—I never milked a cow in my life—men do not milk—I have been employed in farming and seen cows milked WILLIAM FREEMAN I am in the service of Mr Risley a farmer and cowman on Winchmore-hill On the 15th of Sept about four o clock in the morning I was alarmed by a noise and heard Hannant the prosecutor s voice—I heard him cry Murder —I knew his voice—it came from the further side of master s field where the cows were—I did not hear any other voice calling for assistance till I got close to them—I went into the field and found Hannant and the prisoner struggling—the prosecutor called to me Bill come to me he has almost killed me and said before I got up to him I have caught Harvey milking your cows —the prisoner said No I have caught him at it —he was trying to get away—the prosecutor said Take hold of his hand or arm and help to take him out of the field for he will get away from me now —I took hold of him and assisted Hannant in taking him to master s house—when I got near master s house I let go of him to go and unlock the door—he then tried to get from the prosecutor—I ran back and Hannant said Come Bill or else he will get from me —I ran back and succeeded in getting him into master s house—I got a light—Hannant s face was covered with blood also his cape and the front part of his coat—his strength was almost exhausted—he could scarcely stand upright—I saw no mark of injury on the prisoner—there was some of the blood which had come from Hannant on him—master got up and Mr Cresswell the surgeon was sent for—Hannant gave mistress a bottle with milk in it—it was afterwards given to sergeant Emery—I had got up that morning to watch the cows having lost milk before—Hannant was aware that I was going to get up that morning—I was up at the time the alarm morning—I was up at the time the alarm was given Cross-examined Q This was the time you usually get up was it not A I generally get up about five o clock but I had been up an hour and a half—master called me at half-past two o clock—I know the prosecutor perfectly well and so does my master—I do not know the prisoner so well—I never heard a complaint made to the prisoner about our missing milk MR PRENDERGAST to HANNANT Q Do not you know that the prisoner was aware of the complaints about the milk being missed A I told him Risley had complained to me about it WILLIAM RISLEY I am a cow-keeper at Winchmore-hill In consequence of missing milk from the cows I gave Hannant directions to watch the field where they were and on the 14th of Sept about four o clock in the morning I was called up—my boy had got up about two o clock—I called him but he did not go out till about four o clock—when I was called up I heard the prosecutor say For God s sake Risley come down for I am a murdered man —I went down stairs—my boy who had the key unlocked the door—I went out and saw the prisoner trying to get from the prosecutor tassling with him—they were about twelve yards from the door when I first saw them—my boy assisted in bringing the prisoner into the house and while he was there Hannant said You cruel wretch how could you use me so —he answered B—y into you it serves you right you are always looking after me —I saw that they were all bloody and the prosecutor was wounded wonderfully—my wife had much to do to stop the blood—the prisoner was not wounded at all—I had not given the prisoner permission to go into the field Cross-examined Q You had complained of the loss of your milk A Yes to many people—I knew Hannant in the neighbourhood but I was not more intimate with him than the prisoner—I do not know that the boy got up when I called him—he generally gets up at five o clock JOSEPH MELLISH I am an inspector of the N division of police My attention was called to this when I arrived at Risley s house about half-past six o clock—I produce a great coat belonging to the prisoner which I took possession of—I examined the pocket and found it wet with milk inside and outside the pocket—I examined the inside of his coat and found milk spilt on different parts of the coat—I examined the prosecutor s clothes and observed some traces of milk on the skirt of his coat inside in the pocket—I found three cuts on one arm of his coat and two on the other—they went through both his coats—I found a cut on the collar and a corresponding cut also in his small-clothes and there was a cut partially through the stock he had on his neck—I compared a chisel which Emery has with the mark on the stock—it appeared to correspond—I produce the prisoner s stave—it is broken—I found no wound whatever about the prisoner Cross-examined Q I believe you know the prisoner has been a long time in the police force A Yes—I did not give Hannant instructions that night JOSEPH ROBINS On the 14th of Sept I lived with Mr Horlin near Winchmore-hill On the 14th of Sept I found a lantern in his shed which is about a hundred yards from the field where the prosecutor s cows were—No 39 is on it Cross-examined Q Is the shed near the road side A It if in the field—you must go into the field to get into the shed JOHN MITCHELL About six o clock on the morning of the 15th I went to Mr Risley s field where the cows had been and found this chisel—there was blood on it much more than there is now—it was quite fresh blood and on the spot where I found it there was a great quantity of blood as if somebody had been bleeding there and marks of a struggle having taken place—it was fifty or sixty yards from the tree further from Risley s house than the tree—I know Horlin s field—there are two or three gardens between that and Risley s field GEORGE DURANCE I am a policeman of the district I was on duty that morning and about four o clock I heard a cry of Murder which led me to Risley s house—I found the prisoner and prosecutor there—I gave an alarm and Emery and another policeman came—I was one of the persons who took the prisoner to the station about an hour after I first came there—as we went along to the station he said he saw Hannant get over the hedge and milk the cow and he followed him that Hannant begged of him to let him go as it would be a disgrace to his wife and family that he said no he would serve him the same as he would another man—he said the first blow the prosecutor struck him had broken his the prisoner s stave—this lantern I had at nine o clock and gave it to the prisoner at that time—I found his hat in the field afterwards near where the blood was Cross-examined Q Are the staves numbered A Yes—this stave has a piece of twine round it—I only know it from the others by being numbered the same as the policeman MR BODKIN Q Had that broken staff the prisoner s number on it A Yes THOMAS EMERY police-sergeant On the morning of the 15th of Sept I searched the prisoner s lodging about seven o clock and found some carpenter s tools there—I have them here—this chisel was given to me and this quart bottle with about half a pint of milk in it—the cork was out—I had given orders to the prosecutor the night before respecting Risley s field—I told him to watch Cross-examined Q There is but one lantern I believe between three policemen A Yes MR BODKIN Q Has the prosecutor anything to do with the lantern A It is left to him to be trimmed after it is done with—he was not on duty that night—he went off duty at two o clock in the morning and was directed to watch in the field—he would have nothing to do with the lantern then—I did not see him at two o clock JAMES HARRISON policeman I searched the prisoner s lodging on the morning this occurred about ten or eleven o clock—I produce some tools which I found there JAMES SELL I am a carpenter and live at Winchmore-hill I have examined these tools—some of them belong to me and some to my father—this chisel is a mortice chisel—I do not know who that belongs to but it has been in our shop among my father s tools and mine—I remember having used it myself—it has been left in our shop two or three years—I do not know whose it was but we used it—since this matter has been investigated I have applied that chisel to work on which I believe I used it and found it exactly corresponded—we had no other chisel of that size—our shop stands in the yard and most of the tools were kept there—they might be left about the premises—we missed this plane from two to three years and this other plane about three weeks—I did not know the chisel was gone—it could not have been taken long without our missing it—it was the only one of the size we had—I know the prisoner having seen him in the garden of our premises—he has been there to borrow a barrow at times—I remember having seen him there six or nine months ago—I think I have seen him there twice Cross-examined Q He was never in your shop that you know of A Not that I know of—I have seen him at the door—one Morrison lived with the prisoner—he died some time ago—I know he had some tools—he was in the habit of coming to our place—he died in the same house as the prisoner lived—I had the chisel after Morrison died—the other tools were missed al quite a different time except one plane which was lost about six weeks ago JAMES RADFORD My father has a field at Winchmore-hill near Mr Risley s cow field—on the Saturday two or three days after the prisoner was found there I found a stave in my father s field—they would not hare to cross my father s field from where the cows were to get to Risley s—there is a road between our field and Mr Risley s—the road goes down past Mr Risley s house—my father s field is one side of the road and Mr Risley s on the other—I took the stave up and gave it to Risley s man Freeman Cross-examined Q To get to the cow field at Risley s house do you go by a road at all A Yes you can go to the house from the field without going along a road but not without breaking bounds COURT Q Is there a gate from the field to the road A Yet—you go out at the gate into the road to get to the house JOHN CRESWELL I am a surgeon and live at Winchmore-hill On the morning in question I was called into Mr Risley s house and saw the prosecutor bleeding very profusely from a great number of wounds on his head—his hair was so clotted with blood I could not see what was the matter—I cut his hair off cleared the blood away and wound several deep wounds some contused and some incised and a wound on his arm which was evidently done with a stab—that made me notice the other wounds more particularly—I found some of them evidently done by a some of them evidently done by a cutting instrument—I think five wounds were done by a cutting instrument on his head besides one on the top of the breast-bone and one on each fore-arm—three cuts in his face I think were done with a cutting instrument or else with the broken stave—the others were decidedly done with a cutting instrument—this chisel would inflict them—I attended him till he was taken home about eight o clock in the morning and gave him over to the surgeon of the force—two wounds injured his bone denuded the bone on the head but none of them were to be called dangerous beyond the concussion they produced at the time and the consequences which might ensue from inflammation or erysipelas—which might supervene—they were not mortal wounds in themselves—one of them was within one-eighth of an inch of the temporal artery—that was a chisel wound Cross-examined Q They were wounds of the scalp A All the chisel wounds penetrated to the scalp—he never showed symptoms of erysipelas and he recovered from the concussion while I was there—erysipelas may ensue from all wounds where the skin is broken WILLIAM RISLEY re-examined I called my boy up about two o clock in the morning to go to watch the cows—I had told him that the night before—I had also told Hannant about it about eight o clock the night before—I told him I had missed milk a good many times and thought it was done on Sunday night—I told him I had got a lad and another man coming to watch that same morning and I wished him to watch that night until my lad and man earae which I thought would be between three and four GUILTY on 4th and 5th Counts Aged 26 — Transported for Fifteen Years Fourth

went in the front of the house into a little bar where they serve from—the prisoner was not there then—I saw him about half an hour after I went in—I was sitting down on the seat and he commenced bullying me stating something about a quarrel which I had with a friend of his on the previous Saturday—he said if I served him as I had his friend he would punch my head—I said In what way —he said By calling me the names you called him or saying any words to insult me —I laughed at him and said What words would insult you —I called him some name I cannot exactly say what it was but it was something to try to irritate him and he directly struck me—I got up and struck him again—a scuffle ensued—I got him in the corner of the bar and he put his finger and thumb into my mouth and tried to gouge my eye out—he tore my mouth—it bled very much—I said If you don t take your fingers out of my mouth I will bite them —he kept them still in and I believe I did bite them—after this scuffle we went into the parlour—I went in first and the prisoner followed me—we took our seats in different parts of the parlour—we were sitting there an hour or an hour and a half after the scuffle—during that time the prisoner came over to me and said why did I kick his hat—I said Don t let us annoy the company any more don t let us bother and I moved to another part of the room and he to the other part—no words ensued between us after that—about half an hour after the prisoner quitted the room—before he left he said to a person sitting alongside of him You are not going to leave the room just yet are you —he said No —he said Then you will give an eye to my coat —he left his coat on the settle and went out of the room—he returned in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour went and sat down in the seat he had left and drank out of a glass of gin and water which he had left—he then picked up a bit of cigar and walked to the fire-place which was within six feet of me—he had been sitting seventeen or eighteen feet from me—when he came up to the fire I said to him Myers don t let us bear any animosity let us shake hands —I was sitting in a chair at the time—he said something—whether I said With all my heart or whether he did I do not know but the words were used—he walked towards me—I extended my right hand—he held it with his left and shook hands with me with his left hand—he put his right hand behind him and scuffled with his coat—I could not see what he was doing—presently he drew a large knife out saying You b— I will have your b—heart and stabbed me just above my left breast right in the collar-bone—I felt myself struck with the point of the knife and got up out of the chair—he made a second thrust at my left side but I screwed myself round from him put out my hand and caught the knife in my hand—it was done so momentarily that I can hardly tell whether it was a violent blow—he then drew back—the persons in the room halloed out Do you know what you have done why you have murdered the man —he said nothing but walked backwards towards the door and stood at the door about a minute with the knife in his hand—all the people ran after him—there were twelve or fourteen—I saw no more of him till he was in custody—the knife was picked up in the passage—my hand bled very much—I walked to Mr Morgan s the surgeon and saw Mr M Greal who dressed the wounds—I was under him about a fortnight—I have the use of the hand now—I cannot get it up properly—I can use it very well but not quite the same as before Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You have known the prisoner for some years have you not A I was never very much acquainted with him—I let horses and gigs—the prisoner has hired about two of me I think—I do not recollect any fighting men being at this house on the night in question—I should say not one was there that night—I have not been in the habit of associating with those sort of men—I am often in their company—the prisoner had been drinking but was not drunk—I had not spoken to him before he came into the house—it was not a minute after he came in that he said if I called him such a name as I had called his friend he would punch my head—I did not commence it with him—I might have said to him No person wants to think what you are for everybody knows that you are the biggest b—afloat —I dare say I did say so—that was after his calling on me exciting ing me to something when he talked about his friend—I had not on the previous night poured some water and saw-dust on some mutton chops which he and his friend were having dressed—I poured some barley water on the fire not on the chops—it was not saw-dust or water—I did not know they were his mutton chops—it was quite accidental by laying hold of the saucepan which stood on the hob—I swear I did not do it on purpose—on the evening in question I beat him at the bar till he admitted he could contend with me no longer—I struck him in the face—I did not give him a black eye—I struck him in the mouth and fetched blood—he did not cry for quarter and say he could not fight with me—I may be twice as his as him—he went in to the parlour—I was not chaffing him—he kept talking to me in the parlour—I tried to make peace more than anything else—I did not see his new bat—I had kicked his hat in the bar—I did not know where it was then—I kicked his hat after he had kicked me in the groin—I stamped on it so spitefully because I did not want to strike him—I do not know that I crushed it to pieces—I never saw it afterwards—I went into the parlour first and he came in after—there were very ill names used after we went into the parlour which made me say to him Come let us have no more of this —I do not know what words they were—I am in the habit of using vile terms—I dare say words did ensue between us—he said he would have me out of my yard I should not stop in my yard long he would do for me—I did not challenge him to fight and have it out with me nor did I offer to come and fetch him in a chaise next day and take him five miles out of town that we might have it out then—I made use of no such words or any such proposition—I was not drunk or anything like drunk—I was sober—I cannot say quite sober perhaps because I am always perhaps because I am always drinking—I do not know whether I am scarcely ever sober—I am sober now—I am frequently drunk but not every day of my life or anything near it—I did not go up to him and pretend to hold out my hand to be friends with him—I was not near him—the crushing of the hat was in the bar in the first instance MR CHARNOCK Q The first blow was given to you by the prisoner when you were in the bar A Yes—he struck me in the mouth first and after he had kicked me in the groin I kicked his hat—upwards of half an hour elapsed after the bad words were used before he left the room—I had not spoken to him after he returned to the room—the first and only words I said to him were Let us have no animosity and on that the blow was given COURT Q How long had he been sitting there after he returned before you shook hands with him and he struck you A I should say not more than a minute—he directly sat down and took his glass of gin and water then took the cigar and walked up the room JOHN ACTON I am waiter at the Crown in Cranbourne-passage On Tuesday evening the 24th of Sept about eight or nine o clock I was in the parlour and saw the prisoner with a large butcher s knife in his hand—to the best of my belief this now produced is it—he was standing in the middle of the room looking at everybody about the rooms after he had struck Mr Clayard he stood there about half a minute—I went behind him and was in the act of laying hold of him when my master who was on the other side of the room shook his head at me not to touch him—the prisoner turned round and walked out of the room—I followed him and going along the passage he dropped the knife—he walked as far as the beer engine in the bar and then commenced running—at the bottom of the passage I threw him down and gave him into custody—we had no such knife as this in our house—it does not belong to our premises—I had seen the prisoner leave about twenty-five minutes to nine which was about ten minutes before this occurred—I saw him return—I was standing at the top of the court talking to a lad who lives opposite and saw him coming down the court shuffling something in his left coat pocket with his right hand—I was not present when the blows were given—I heard the screaming and noise Cross-examined Q Was Clayards drunk A No—he had been drinking—the prisoner was not tipsy that I saw—he had been drinking but I saw no tipsy action in him—he did not tumble down or walk crooked or anything of that sort—I am servant to Mr Banks—he formerly kept a public-house in the Rookery St Giles s—it was after the blow was struck that I came into the room—the prisoner was then standing with his hand out staring wildly round him—I did not notice whether he was in a violent frenzy or rage I was so frightened seeing such a knife in his hand COURT Q Do you know the prisoner A Yes—I do not know what he is ROBERT CLAYARDS re-examined I do not krow what the prisoner is—I believe he keeps an open house in North-alley—I believe he did keep some wine rooms in Windmill-street but he keeps a house of ill fame JOSEPH BANKS I keep the Crown in Cranbourne-passage On Tuesday evening the 24th about seven o clock I was in the bar parlour when Clayards came in—my attention was called by my daughter saying there was a fight with Clayards and Myers in front of the bar—I did not see who gave the first blow—Clayards afterwards went into the parlour and Myers followed him some time after—I was in and out of the parlour several times—when I first saw them I think they were not far from each other but Clayards left and went to the other end of the room which was seventeen or eighteen feet from where Myers was sitting—that was at a subsequent part of the evening—I recollect Myers saying to a person Give an eye to my coat and he went out of the house—on his return I was in the parlour—I should say it was half-past eight when he went out—it was an hour or better after the commencement—on his return he said I suppose there has been a good deal said about Abey Myers —he resumed his seat which was about seventeen feet from where Clayards was sitting—he drank and sat down—in a minute or so he went to the fire to light his cigar and Clayards wished to make friends—I believe he said Let us be friendly again or something of that sort—Clayards was at that time sitting in a chair—he held out his hand-Myers went to him to shake hands—I was sitting by the side—he put his hand behind him and I really do not recollect seeing what he pulled from it but in the course of a second or so Clayards was stabbed—he put hit right hand behind him and that is all I recollect till Clayards rose and said I am stabbed —I saw the knife in Myers s hand after he drew back—I hear that he struck at him twice but it was so quick I did not see how the blow was averted at the second strike I was so close to him—I saw him put his hand out but I was so alarmed—I saw Clayards hand and thumb bleeding and he was sent to the doctor s—when Myers put his hand behind him I was so frightened that I cannot say what was said—he drew himself backwards to the door and stood—my boy came in hearing the noise—he says I shook my head for him not to touch Myers but I do not recollect it—I got on a seat—Myers turned round and opened the door and we then all ran after him—when we got to the end of the court the boy had overtaken him—I had been in the parlour about half an hour before Myers went away—during that half hour I do not think there were any words of irritation on the part of Clayards towards Myers—I think Myers was fresh in liquor and everybody more avoided him than to enter into any debate particularly Cross-examined Q Was he fresh in liquor before he went out A When he came in first I should say he was fresh in liquor when the row commenced—he only had fourpenny worth of gin and water in my house in the space of two hours and he left nearly all that when he left the house—he did not get more drunk in my house—I should say he was more than three parts drunk when he came—I should say Clayards was sober for he avoided having anything to do with Myers all the way through seeing him so excited—I saw him stamp the hat to pieces in the bar—I did not see him strike him because they were in the scuffle—he was not knocked down at all—he was struck in the mouth I believe—I did not see the whole of it—I was called out in the scuffle—I saw Myers kick Clayards and I said to him If my leg was well I would knock you down for kicking so unmanly I had the gout at the time and then Clayards broke the hat—I do not recollect the circumstance of the mutton-chops—I was not in the room at the time—I have kept this house eleven months—I lived at the Rookery in St Giles s ten years—I do not mind going into rows—I can take my own part—I am the Mr Banks that went to the theatre MR CHARNOCK Q Was it after Myers had kicked Clayards in the unmanly way you describe that he kicked Myers s hat A Yes LOUIS BOUROGEAUX I am a tailor and live in Broad-street Bloomsbury I was at the Crown on the 24th of Sept —I saw nothing of the scuffle at the bar—I found all the parties in the parlour—when I went in Banks shook hands with me and Myers came to me shook hands with me and asked me how I was—I found all sitting except Myers who was standing by the fire—I sat down and he came and sat by my side—I saw he had a swollen lip and said to him Halloo what is the matter with you have you been fighting —he said Yes I have been having a row and they are all against me here landlord and all —Banks said to him You had better leave the landlord alone for he does not want to have anything to do with you —nothing was said or done by Clayards—I did not know him—I was in the parlour from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes before Myers left—during that time nothing was done by Clayards to irritate or aggravate him not in the least—they were sitting apart and separate from each other quite at opposite ends of the room—before Myers went out he said to me Are you going just yet —I said No —he said Then will you please to give an eye to my coat —I said Certainly —on his coming back he resumed the same scat—he got up again instantly and was going to light his cigar—during the time he was reaching a paper off the mantel-piece to get a light Clayards said to him There should be no animosity between us come come let us shake hands and be friends —he held out his right hand Myers gave his left and when Clayards said Here is my hand and heart with it Myers said And here is my hand —he kept his hand behind his back and made a plunge at him and as he was making the plunge he said I will have your b—heart —I saw this knife in his hand—he made the plunge towards Clayards—I do not know whether it went into his abdomen or his breast—I did not see any second thrust or attempt—he drew himself back—as he was going away a man cried out Good God you have stabbed the man —he looked at him and said That is the way to serve such a b—as him Cross-examined Q You were not before the Magistrate A No—I carry on my business at No 41 Broad-street Bloomsbury—I have private apartments there—I was subpoenaed last Saturday—that was the first time I was called on about it MR CHARNOCK Q I believe you are not the friend of Clayards A I never knew him before—I am no acquaintance of Myers—I have met him THOMAS MC GREAL I am assistant to Mr Morgan a surgeon in St Martin s-lane On the night in question the prosecutor came to our house—I found two wounds on him one on the left side of his chest and the other on his right thumb—the wound on the chest was about an inch and a half long—a superficial wound—it was just over the second rib extending obliquely over it—I dressed it—the other was also a simple wound inflicted with some sharp instrument—I think this knife might inflict such a wound—he was under my care about ten days or a fortnight—the wound on the chest was not as it was a dangerous wound it merely divided the skin—it did not go to the bone Cross-examined Q And the other was quite a superficial wound A It was a little deeper but a simple wound nothing to place him in any jeopardy JAMES AMOS FISHER policeman I have produced the knife—the prisoner was taken into custody by another constable

t18441125-45  45 JOHN OGILVIE was indicted for feloniously assaulting Frederick Louis Mieville and threatening to accuse him of having endeavoured to commit with him the abominable crime of b—y with a view and intent to extort from him his goods and chattels and by such threats feloniously extorting from him 5 sovereigns 1 half-sovereign 1 watch value 30l and 1 guard-chain 8l his goods and monies 2ND COUNT for a robbery on the said Frederick Louis Mieville and stealing from his person and against his will the said goods and monies MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution FREDERICK LOUIS MIEVILLF I am a member of the Stock Exchange and my place of business is with my brothers in Angel-court Throgmorton-street My private residence is No 23 Hanover-square—on Sunday the 6th of Oct last I left home about eight o clock in the evening to visit a friend named Goodbairn who lived near the Middlesex Hospital—it is the last house but one in Mortimer-street—he was not at home—finding him absent I thought of going to spend the evening with Mr Davison a friend of mine in Piccadilly—I walked to the end of Mortimer-street and down Goodge-street to take a cab or omnibus as there were not any where I was—that brought me to the corner of Goodge-street in Tottenham-court-road—I just looked about for a cab or an omnibus and saw the prisoner—he was very respectably dressed—he had on a white great coat and an umbrella in his hand—he seemed to me to be looking for something and said to me Are you looking for anything sir or just that question—I said yes I was looking for a cab or an omnibus to go to Piccadilly—this was at the corner of Goodge-street in Tottenham-court-road exactly at the corner COURT Q But had you not passed a stand of hackney-cabs between Middlesex-hospital and the end of Goodge-street A There were no cabs at all and even at the stand where I did take a cab there was only I believe one or two—there were none in Goodge-street MR CLARKSON Q What did the prisoner say A He said that there was no omnibus but that there were plenty of cabs a little higher up—I had just stopped an instant to answer him—I said That I know I thank you —he said I am going myself to Piccadilly and very bad walking it is —it had been raining the whole of the day—it was not raining then—it had cleared up in the evening—he took some trouble in showing me the cab and I said to him Well if it is of any convenience to you if you are going to Piccadilly I will allow you to ride in the cab which he accepted and thanked me very much for it—I called the cab—there was one large cab at the corner of Windmill-street and I said O I will not have that large cab —it was a four-wheeled cab and I thought it would take me such a time to go to Piccadilly—I just walked on two or three steps and called a cab—it was between Windmill-street and Percy-street—the cab drove near the pavement and I made him a sign to get in—I told the cab man to drive to Piccadilly—he went through those streets near Soho-square—he drove exceedingly fast for in the cab I said Why this man will upset me —when we got close to Piccadilly the prisoner put both his hands on my coat—I had on a great coat exactly like the one I have on now—I felt alarmed at such a thing and I said I shall stop the cab —the prisoner said It is no use your stopping the cab I want money and unless you give me some I will drive you or I will take you to the station-house —I had not made use of any indecent expression or used any indecent act towards him or attempted to do so—I said To the station-house and what for —I was in a very excited state at the moment quite alarmed and surprised at such a thing and he repeated Yes to the station-house and when I asked him what for he said I will show you what for or Never mind what for —just such an expression as that—I said I will take you myself to the station-house you monster or something and I called to the cab man to stop—the prisoner directly put his head to the window and called to him Drive to the station-house —I insisted again on the cab man s stopping and he drew up his cab close to the corner of Half Moon-street—I opened the cab door and let myself out—the cab man was also down immediately—the prisoner followed me out of the cab and said to the cab man You take this man or this gentleman to the station-house and at the same time he pronounced a word which left me in no doubt as to his intentions—he said You take this gentleman to the station-house the b— —he repeated that two or three times—I felt so alarmed so unnerved at hearing such horrible threats that I quite lost my presence of mind and I actually ran away down Half Moon-street—I had paid the cab man first—he said I must be paid —I had a shilling about me and I gave it to him—the prisoner followed me down Half Moon-street and called two or three times in a faint voice Stop stop —when I got to the end of the street I could not run any longer—I stopped there and the prisoner came up to me—he said Now you give me 20l or I shall not let you go —I opened my coat took my purse out of my waistcoat pocket and gave him the contents of it—there was 5l 10s in gold—that was all I had about me or I should have given him more—then I suppose be saw by a little chain which I had on my waistcoat that I had a watch and he came forward and said And I shall have your watch also —he came as if to snatch it from me and I really helped him to let him rob me—I stooped my head and took the chain off my neck—my watch was attached to the chain—it was a gold watch with a white face—it had been made by vanner the clockmaker—it had cost 35l —there were two made and we paid 70l for the two—the chain was given me as a present—it was worth perhaps from 8l to 10l —when he had got the watch he said Now that will do you go that way pointing in a different direction to Piccadilly—I turned round—I do not know that I exactly went that way—I did not know exactly where I was—I found myself in Charles-street Berkeley-square and from there I walked home—the prisoner went I think towards Bond-street COURT Q Where was the spot where you parted from your watch and chain how far had you got from Piccadilly A It was quite at the end of Half Moon-street—it leads into May-fair I think JURY Q The other part leads to a by passage A Yes it seemed to me to be all dark MR CLARKSON Q Did you go home to your family A I went home directly—I am living with an elder brother in Hanover-square who has lost his wife—he has two little girls who are sometimes at school and sometimes stopping there—I have another brother who is married and has a large family—I got home about ten o clock—my brother was not up—I did not tell my brother in the morning what had happened—I hesitated about speaking to him about it—I thought it was such a dis-agreeable subject to treat that even to him I thought for the present to say nothing about it Q Now when was the next time if ever that you saw the man who had taken your property in Half Moon-street A On Tuesday the 5th of Nov a month afterwards about a quarter to five o clock—I was coming from the counting-house in Angel-court and going home—I was quite alone and saw the prisoner standing under one of those two doors or small arches of the Bank in Threadneedle-street opposite what was Thread-needle-street needle-street and is now the Royal Exchange—I saw him and recognised him perfectly but I did not pay any attention to him whatever not even to turn my head—I went towards the Mansion-house to the Poultry and Cheapside way—when I got just near the fruit-shop at the corner of Prince s-street I thought there was somebody following me and I crossed over—the prisoner also crossed passed me and looked at me—I recrossed the street and turned into the Old Jewry to avoid him—he came up to me in the Old Jewry and said How do you do sir —I said Why do you know me —he said I should like to say something to you —I said You had better pass your way I have nothing to say to you whatever —I then turned round and walked to my brother s counting-house in Angel-court I walked fast to make him acquainted with what had happened to me—I heard the prisoner call Stop once in Angel-court court before I went into the house—I went in and pushed to the entrance door—on going into my brother s counting-house it was foreign post night and my brother was very busy just having come from the Royal Exchange—there were five or six clerks strangers there and they expected on that day two or three friends to dine at the counting-house with them one of them had already arrived and I saw but little chance of speaking to my brother on such a subject in a satisfactory way to myself—my brother carries on a very extensive business as a merchant—I stopped there for half an hour and after that called James Cole the porter of the house and had a communication with him—the prisoner did not hear it—after that I left the house—there are two doors—the counting-house consists of two houses—one stands backwards and the other forwards—I came in by the backward door and went out through the other door—I did all I could to avoid the prisoner and for that occasion I escaped him and went home—on the following morning at seven o clock before dressing I put on a dressing-gown went to my brother John Louis who was in bed and told him what had happened to me—he gave me advice how to act in case I ever saw the prisoner again—on the Friday week following the 15th of Nov I was walking home from the Counting-house with my brother Amedee Francis Mieville who had been told what had happened to me and saw the prisoner at the same place that I had seen him in on the 5th close by the door—I pointed him out to my brother and said That is the man I shall get a policeman to take him up —I got a policeman who followed me and I walked close to the prisoner but he said nothing at all to me—he did not appear to know me then—I passed him close once or twice—I then gave him in charge to the policeman—I told the policeman in his hearing that I charged him with robbing me—the prisoner did not answer anything then—we all walked to the station and then the prisoner said he was surprised that we had him arrested that he did not know us and had never seen either of the gentlemen before speaking of my brother and myself—I said to him Did not you follow me to the counting-house last Tuesday week —he said No I never followed you anywhere I do not even know where your counting-house is or anything about you Prisoner The prosecutor says he met me in Tottenham-court-road between seven and eight o clock on the 6th of Oct that when I met him on Tuesday the 5th of Nov he declared he did not know me and a fortnight after he came up to me and said he did know me Witness I did not say I did not know him on the 5th of Nov —I said to him Do you know me and he answered I know you and even called it out loud when I was leaving him to go to my brother s counting-house—he said I know you it is no use your running away I know you JURY Q What sort of a cab was it that you and the prisoner were in together A A little common four-wheeled cab not a twowheeled one—it was not one of those in which you sit face to face but a common little close four-wheeled cab—we sat side by side—it was not one of Hanson s—it was a close cab not an open one at all JOHN LOUIS MIEVILLE I carry on the business of a merchant—the prosecutor is my younger brother—I live with him in Hanover-square—I am not a widower—I have been divorced—I have two children who are at present at school—they have been living with me—my brother and I have two sets of chambers in the same house—we occupy different apartments but adjoining one another On Wednesday morning the 6th of Nov before I was dressed my brother came into my room and made a disclosure of something that had happened to him—he disclosed to me exactly what he has been describing here—I gave him advice what to do in case he ever again met with the person—he is rather timid—he is not wanting in spirit but I think he lost all his presence of mind on this occasion I was quite surprised JAMES COLE I live at No 11 Angel-court Throgmorton-street—I am the porter and housekeeper there On Tuesday evening the 5th of Nov about five o clock as near as I can tell I heard a ring at the bell—I can hear the counting-house door when it shuts—I think I recollect having heard it shut just before that—I answered the bell—I found the prisoner at the door and likewise Lewis Cole a nephew of mine who is employed in the office and who had just returned from the Post-office—the prisoner said I want to see that gentleman that has just gone in —he spoke rather in a hurried tone and in a menacing and authoritative way—I said I don t know who you mean for I saw no one go in —I said There are two persons just gone out because I had seen two persons come down stairs and go out just before he rang the bell or almost about the same instant that he did ring the bell—he said Yes I know that but there is one just gone in that is the one I want to see —I told him I did not know who he meant if he told me who he wanted I would go to them and said You had better come in yourself and see I cannot tell who has come in —he objected to that and said No you must know who I mean you had better go and tell him I want him —I do not know that he said I want him but he is wanted or something of that kind—I could not swear to the words that he used—it was to that meaning—just at that time one of the clerks came down and I asked him Is any one gone up to your office —he said Yes Mr Frederick Mieville went up just now I believe he said in a great hurry —that was in the prisoner s hearing—the prisoner then said to him He has got a frieze coat on has he not —he said Yes —he said Then that is the one I want to see —I supposed from that that there had been some dispute in some way or other and 1 said I don t know who you want but if that is the person you want ring that bell showing him the bell of the office and they will open the door to you themselves and you can go up into the office —he said Oh no you had better go and tell him —I think a little before the clerk came down he said Oh he lives somewhere by the Waterloo-road —I said I don t know we have a great many gentlemen men about the house but I am not aware where they all live —I remember repeating that in the clerk s presence and the prisoner said Oh I don t know exactly where he lives and it appeared to me that he had said something more than he intended to say—my nephew then came in and I shut the door and as I was going hack to the hall-door Mr Frederick Mieville called to me from the stairs—I went up the stain to him and after I had spoken to him he went out by the other door—after he had gone I went to the door at which I had seen the prisoner—it appeared to me that he had just gone away from the door to go—he had got to the next house but as I opened the door he returned and I said If that is the gentleman you want the gentleman you have been speaking of you will not see him tonight he is gone —he said He is gone is he —I said Yes and if you want to see him you must come to-morrow between ten and eleven o clock and you will be pretty sure to find him —he had heard the name before from the clerk and I pointed to the name on the door and said You see the name and if you come to-morrow morning between ten and eleven you will be pretty sure to find him —he said Well then I will come to-morrow in a positive tone—I said You had better do so and he left but he turned a different way—he turned to the right down the court—he had turned to the left—I have not the slightest doubt of the prisoner being the person—I should think he was at the door half-an-hour altogether—it could not be less—next day in consequence of what I was told I went to the door several times and looked about—I kept a look out for him as well as I could—I did not stand to look particularly for him—I saw nothing of him—I had received directions to be on the look-out for him from Mr Louis Mieville directly he came in the morning COURT Q You had pointed to the name and to the bell A Yes—he appeared very reluctant to come into the house—he would not come in LEWIS COLE I am nephew to the last witness—I am not thirteen years old—I live with my uncle in Angel-court On Tuesday afternoon the 5th of Nov about five o clock I had been out and as I came to the counting-house door saw the prisoner—I am sure he is the person—he was there in my sight I should think about twenty minutes—he was asking for somebody AMEDEB FRANCIS MIEVILLE The prosecutor and Mr J L Mieville are my younger brothers—I am married and have a large family—I live at No 32 Notting-hill-place On Wednesday the 6th of Nov my younger brother made a communication to me of something that had happened to him—I was in his company on Friday afternoon the 15th of Nov about a quarter past four or a quarter to five o clock coming from my office—at one of the arches leading to the Bank my brother pointed out the prisoner to me—he was given in charge of a policeman as soon as we could find one and taken to the station-house—when the charge was made against him at the station he said that he had never seen either of the gentlemen before in his life meaning me and my brother—I believe on that my brother said to him Did not you follow me to Angel-court —he said No sir I never saw you in my life or never saw you before or something of that sort—he might have said I don t know your counting-house or something of that kind—my recollection is not perfect on the subject Prisoner Q Did I say anything about the counting-house in the street when you came up to me and gave me into custody A You were given into custody and never spoke till the policeman asked my brother what he charged you with—he charged you with having robbed him—you did not speak till the inspector asked you a few questions at the station What have you got to say against these two gentlemen s charge against you —you said I never saw either of these gentlemen before —the inspector took it all down in writing—the inspector or my brother asked Did not you follow me or that gentleman to his office and you said no you never did JAMES FRANKLIN City police-constable No 423 My inspector is ill—he is living at Camberwell—he has been away from duty six or seven days About five o clock on Friday afternoon the 15th of Nov I was called on to take the prisoner into custody—I took him to the station accompanied by the two gentlemen—the prosecutor told me what he charged him with and I told the prisoner—I said he was charged with robbing him—he said I never saw that gentleman in my life before —I then took him to the station—he made that remark to me on the road to the station in the street CHARLES ROUS I am a cab man—I know the prisoner—I have known him six years—I was driving a cab on Sunday evening the 6th of Oct last—I was on the stand in Tottenham-court-road on that evening—I was called off the stand by somebody Q Who got into your cab A I did not know who got into my cab at the time—I was sitting nearly asleep on the cab—two persons got in— looking at the prosecutor —that is one of them—the prisoner is the other Prisoner Q What time did I get into your cab A About nine o clock Prisoner He stated at the office the first time that it was between ten and eleven o clock I wish his deposition to be read Witness Looking at his deposition This is my mark—it was read over to me before I put my mark to it Read The said Charles Rous on oath says I live at No 5 Little Britain Chinamews Bedford-square and am a cab man—I know the prisoner at the bar—his name is William Ward or Ogilvie—I have known him to go by the name of Ward and also by the nick-name of Blinding—I have known him six or seven years On a Sunday evening a few weeks back I was first cab on the stand in Tottenham-court-road—I had been there a good many hours—I had not seen the prisoner—a cab was called and I pulled down to the comer of Percy-street—that was in the evening about nine or ten o clock—the prisoner and another gentleman got in—the prisoner had a kind of white outside coat on—I was told to drive to Piccadilly by the person who let them in—I drove to Piccadilly and when at the other side of Half Moon-street the checkstring was pulled and I stopped—there was a sort of a wrangle and I heard the words Drive to the station and I was about to turn round to do so when they both got out—I then stopped and asked for my fare and the gentleman gave me a shilling—the gentleman then ran up Half Moon-street and the prisoner after him—I then lost sight of them—the prisoner did not return to me Witness That is all correct—that is what I said and I still adhere to it Prisoner He said before the Magistrate that he did not know me when I got into the cab Witness I did not know them for I never saw them when they got into the cab—I did not let them in myself—a person named Parsons opened the door COURT Q Did you know them when they got out A No not till I jumped down off the cab for my fare—I did not recognise the man I had known for seven years—when they got out of my cab and I saw the prisoner in the white coat I did not know him to be the man I had known for seven years—I did not let them into the cab—I have stated in my deposition and to-day that the prisoner and another gentleman got in—it is true that the prisoner ran after the gentleman up Half Moon-street Q Then why do you say that you do not know who got in A I said I did not know who got in at the time—if I said I did not know who got out it was a mistake—I did know it was the man I had known for seven years Q How have you known this man for seven years where and under what circumstances A By his brother who used to drive a cab—he never accompanied me when I was engaged with my cab—not on the box or otherwise Prisoner Q Will you take your oath I never rode with you that I never sat on the box with you when you drove your father s cab did I never ride with you or talk with you in your company A You might have rode from Holborn up to the stable with me on my cab Prisoner First he says he knew me when I got out and then he says he does not know whether I got out of his cab or no and yet he says I got into his cab—there is no believing him on his oath MR CLARKSON Q You say you were half asleep when your cab was called A Yes Prisoner Before he got to Piccadilly he would be awake I should think and would know who got out COURT Q Were you awake before you got to Piccadilly A Yes certainly—I had a very fast horse in my cab and I drove fast—I drove to the other side of Half Moon-street when the checkstring was pulled—if it had not been pulled I should have driven to the top of Piccadilly Prisoner The prosecutor does not say anything about the checkstring he says he called to him to stop I do not wish him asked whether he pulled it or not MR CLARKSON Q When the prisoner or whoever it was got into your cab he had a white coat on A Yes I saw him when he came out of my cab—I was quite awake then—I did not know him then not exactly know him—I thought it was him but he was too well dressed for me to attempt to recognise him—he was dressed like a gentleman—I had not seen him before that day—nor did I see him after that night COURT Q Not till he was in custody A No MR CLARKSON Q You did not see him from the time he left your cab and went down Half Moon-street after the gentleman until he was in custody A No Q Just let us understand do you mean to tell the Jury on your solemn oath that you had seen nothing of the prisoner from the time he went after the gentleman down Half Moon-street till you saw him in custody A I saw him—no—I think—no—he was in a cab in Regent-street on the Monday following I think it was JURYM Q Was that before he was in custody A Yes MR CLARKSON Q Why it was the very Monday after this happened was it not A Yes Prisoner You are putting the words into the man s mouth just now he said he never saw me till I was in custody COURT Q What is the number of your badge A No 7783 producing it that is the same number I had—it is not the number of the cab I had on the Sunday night—that is my number—the number of the cab was 398 I think—it was Mr Bardell s cab—it was No 398—I have no doubt about it—I do not drive the same number still—I do not drive a cab at all now—I have not been out with a cab lately—we do not give up our number when we cease to drive—it was the day after this happened that I saw the prisoner in the cab in Regent-street—I do not know whether he had got the white coat on then—he was inside the cab—he called to me and said I left an umbrella in your cab on Sunday night —I said I found an umbrella in my cab and if you go to where I live No 20 Pitt-street Tottenham Court-road you can get it —he said If you give me the umbrella back I will give you half-a-crown —I said Very well you can have it if you call there —he then said Bill and ordered the cab he was in to drive to the corner of Maddox-street and said he would give me half-a-crown and treat me to a drop of gin if I let him have the umbrella—I got the half-crown at the corner of Maddox-street Regent-street—I went into the public-house with him and the other cab-man—I do not know who the other cabman was—he is a man that uses the Haymarket in general—I do not know the number of his cab—I did not take notice—we had some gin together—we did not remain there five minutes Q When did you next see the prisoner after that A I did not see him any more till he called round at my house for the umbrella and the young woman that I was with gave it him—I did not see him—he came for the umbrella in the afternoon—do you mean when did I see him after that Monday Q You cannot doubt what I mean by next when did you see him next after the time you have last mentioned A He came in the afternoon for the umbrella—I saw him—it was in Tottenham Court-road at the Crab Tree—I went round to try to get the umbrella and my mistress the young woman I was with was out and he called the next day for it and got it himself—I was not at home when he received the umbrella—I did not see him any more after that till he was at Bow-street—the half-crown was all I got on that day Q Did he explain to you why he ran after the gentleman up Half Moon-street A No and I did not ask him—I did not ask him for any explanation of what had occurred in my cab—I do not know what the dispute was about—I had not the curiosity to ask him why he ran after the gentleman or why he told me to drive to the station—I never asked him any such thing or made any inquiry about it Prisoner Q Did I meet you next day give you half-a-crown and say I had left my umbrella in your cab A Yes and I told you to call in the afternoon—you did come and get it—I do not know whether it was on the Tuesday—I did not make any inquiry about it when I went home—you said you would call for it and I left word that you were to have it—you got it—Mary Ann Hill gave it to you as she told me JOHN ADOLPHUS GEORGE BOWSTEAD I acted as clerk to the Justices at the Police Court Bow-street—on the prisoner s examination on this charge he was asked if he had anything to say—he made a statement which I took down in writing from his lips—after I had done so I read it over to him and Mr Jardine the Magistrate put his name to it—this is the examination — Reading— The prisoner says He has charged me wrongfully I never saw him before last Tuesday week I then went up and spoke to him taking him for a friend of mine whom he resembled I said How do you do sir you know me he said he did not and ran away 1 said O nonsense you do and his running away induced me to think that he was the man and 1 followed him—I became satisfied that he was not the person whom I took him to be on his passing me twice yesterday he then came up with a policeman and gave me in charge I told him that I had never seen him before to rob him he said I had and gave me in charge Prisoner s Defence I was standing outside the Bank waiting for a friend of mine when the prosecutor came up and gave me in charge for robbing him I declared I did not know him which I did not at the time till I got to the station-house and I should not have known him then had I not seen his porter which made me think it was the man I had spoken to on the 5th of Nov He gave me in charge for robbing him which I declared I was innocent of He says he met me on Sunday night the 6th of Oct that he was waiting for a cab in Tottenham-court-road that I came up and addressed him and asked what he was waiting for that he told me and that I said there were no omnibuses but plenty of cabs and with that he called one and asked me to get into the cab Is it feasible that a gentleman should ask a stranger to get into a cab with him However he says he asked me to do so and that we rode to Piccadilly and as we were going along Piccadilly I should use some rough language to him inside the cab and say I wanted some money from him that I asked him for 20l and told the cabman to go to the station-house He says he told the cabman to stop got out gave him 1s and ran down half-moon-street that I followed him and asked him for money and that he gave me 5l 10s in gold and his watch and chain Now is it feasible that any gentleman would give any lad his money like that or his watch and chain under such circumstances as that With that he says I told him to go one way and me the other and he says he went in his fright and never saw anything of me till the 5th of Nov I was then coming through the City with a friend of mine and 1 said to him There goes a gentleman that resembles a man who owes me something he said Why don t you go up to him which I did and said How do you do I could not see him clearly not his features he said I don t know you I said Yes you do know me sir with that be ran away as hard as he could which made me think it was him he ran into the office and nearly slammed my fingers in the door I waited till the porter came to the door and said Can I speak to the gentleman who has just gone in he said Which gentleman there is one just gone out I said No the one who has just gone in he said he did not know who it was I described him as well as I could the porter went up stairs whether he spoke to him I do not know but he came down again and said he was gone and if I wanted him I must come to-morrow as he was talking I saw the prosecutor come down with a light I then had a good view of him and he turned to the door at the left I said I would come to-morrow but I did not go near the house since and the next time be charged me with robbing him If I was the man why did he not know me on the 5th of Nov and give me into custody then as well as a fortnight after He says I had a white coat on they have been to my lodging and I never bad a white coat and if I rode in a cab with a gentleman for only three or four minutes through the streets and had a white coat on would not that make a great deal of difference in my appearance How would he know me a month after in a black coat so well as that I have my master here Mr James a shoemaker whom I work for WILLIAM JAMES I am a shoemaker and live at No 26 Gough-street Mount-pleasant I never saw the prisoner with a white coat—he lodged with me but has not done so since he came home one night tipsy—I told him if he could not come home in a better way than that he should not come home any more—in the morning he asked me if I could let him have some money and I gave him 2s Prisoner It is about a month ago that I left him COURT Q Where was he lodging on the 6th of Oct A Why he was lodging with me about that time—he was lodging in Gough-street on the 6th of Oct with me—that I swear—he was lodging with me about that time—I do not know exactly to a day because I do not bear those things in mind—the last time I saw him was the first Sunday in Oct —the last time I saw him when he left my lodgings was on the first Monday in Oct —he came home very tipsy on the Sunday night and I told him he should not come home any more for if he could find money to get drunk with he could find money to pay me—he did not lodge with me after that—he has not been there since Q What time had you seen him before on that Sunday when he came home drunk A He went away soon after dinner it might have been two o clock perhaps but I cannot say to a minute—it was towards the morning that he came home drunk—I believe it was turned twelve—it might have been two for what I know—I was in bed and he caused a disturbance coming up—I got out to give him the key to go into the room and told him if he could not come home sober not to come home any more if he could afford to get drunk he could afford to pay me—I cannot say whether he was in my debt—I never kept any bill against him—I always gave him money because he is a relative of mine—I cannot reckon him in debt because he never owed me any money—he used to do work for me shoemaking—I believe he had done some that week—he had been at work during the week—there are two or three pawnbrokers near me one is named Brown and one Lindell I think—one lives at the corner of Wilson-street and the other in North-place—I saw the prisoner when he came home that night because I believe he struck a light—I gave him the matches to get a light—he had my candle to go to bed with Q What means of living had he when he lodged with you A He had no means I believe no more than what I gave him and what he did—I cannot say what I had given him during the last month—he had a good many shillings from me I reckon—I cannot say how many—sometimes I gave him 1s perhaps sometimes 6d or 3d or 2d or what not according as I was situated myself Q What will you swear you had given towards his support for a month previous to the 6th of Oct A I gave him his victuals according to what I had he had—I never saw him in any particular gentleman s clothes—I cannot say what means he might have had—I never saw him in any gentleman s clothes—I never considered that he had as much as 5l MR CLARKSON Q What relative is he of yours A My nephew—I do not know Rous at all only by seeing him at Bow-street—I never saw him before—the prisoner was at my house on the Monday morning—he had no shoemaking to do for me then nor myself either—I was not particularly badly off at that time—I might be without work a day or two—I am badly off at any time when I am at work—my circumstances were the same that Monday as they might have been at any other time Q When had you last before the Sunday night given him any money A During the week—I cannot say the day—I might have given him 3s or 4s during that week—I had not given it to him all at once—I gave him 6d sometimes and sometimes 1s —I did not give it to him without his asking me for it—he asked me to let him have 1s or 2s and I gave him according to what I could—I think the last I gave him was on the Friday—I think it was 6d I gave him then—it was at night—of course he asked me for it or I should not have given it him—he asked me if I could let him have 1s or 6d —of course I expected he was without money or I should not have given it him Q Do you know where he could get half-a-crown from to pay for an umbrella A I gave him 2s on the Monday morning as he came home on the Sunday night and told him not to come to my place any more—he asked me if I could let him have 1s or 2s then and I said Don t you come to my place again if you can get drunk you can keep yourself without getting money from me —I have not got any umbrella of his I have no use for it—I occupy three rooms on the second floor—I have a wife but no family—I work at home—the prisoner occupied the back room—I worked and all in the room—we lived in it all together—they are but small rooms—I do not know where he lived after he left me—I told him there and then not to come any more and I never thought anything further about it COURT Q How did you hear of his being taken up charged with this robbery A Why I had heard of it on the Saturday I think and two gentlemen came to me on the Sunday MR CLARKSON Q Was he ever in the Refuge A Yes he has been—I should say it was about five or six months ago—I have never been in such a place nor in any prison at all—I cannot say how often the prisoner has been there I have never inquired—I did not come here to give him a character I came merely to hear the trial as I understood he was to be tried GUILTY Aged 19 — Transported for Life There was another indictment against the prisoner for a similar

half an hour afterwards driving my father s horse and cart and saw the prisoner again—she was holding a child by one leg and shoving its body into the water—I cannot exactly say how long she held it

t18450616-1277  1277 JAMES QUANTOCK was indicted for feloniously assaulting Joseph Dowling on the 19th of May and cutting and wounding him in and upon his chest with intent to do grievous bodily harm JOSEPH DOWLING I have known the prisoner five or six years—about last Christmas I was taking a drunken man home—I saw the prisoner take the man s purse out of his pocket and go away with it and I gare information of it to the policeman—one Monday last May I went to tie Red Lion public-house in Holborn and saw the prisoner there about a yard from the doorway—directly I entered the house he said You b—old rogue I will do for you —he caught hold of my neckcloth and three me right down on my back on the floor—he kept hold of my neckcloth and held it for five minutes until I was nearly strangled—I could not get up—he was standing straight across me leaning down towards me—a female in his company interfered and said Let him get up or he would have strangled me—she did not pull him off—she persuaded him to let me go—he let me get up and then gave me a very violent blow in the breast as I thought with his fist—I did nothing to him—I found it a very curious feel and as he pulled his hand away he cut the top of my thumb and I saw the blade of a knife in his hand—he walked out directly—I am down on the bench and had a pint of beer—my breast felt very painful—when I had had my beer I went home—I did not undress it was so painful I laid down with my clothes on—in the morning I found I wat covered with blood all over—I found it so about two hours after I got home—I complained to my brother about it—this is the coat and waistead I wore—the wound was right in the centre of the breast—here is a mark of bloood inside the waistcoat all round—it is a double-breasted waistcost—it is not cut as it was not buttoned up to the top Cross-examined by MR BALDWIN Q What are you A A private watchman—I did not take the prisoner into custody when he took the purse because I am not a constable and I could not detain the gentleman—I had seen the prisoner many times since that most Saturday nights—I had no occasion to give him in charge—I had given information to the policeman when I saw it and gave him into custody in less than ten minutes—the policeman is not here—he was taken and discharged in the morning as nobody appeared against him—I was too late—this happened in the Red Lion at six o clock in the morning—I had not seen him there—I have had a good many quarrels with him about the charge of robbery—he frequently abuses me when I am in the street—he spoke first when I went in—I did not speak at all—I did nothing to him—after I was stabbed I put my arm out and took hold of his nose and wrung it—I swear that was after he struck me the blow in the chest—my thumb was cut very slightly but it bled very much—that was not done as I was wringing his nose Q You did not find out you were wounded until ten o clock in the morning A I felt it very much indeed while I was going home—I was too ill to take off my coat and see what was the matter—I was exhausted having been out all night—I was hardly able to walk home—I felt I had been hurt but did not take off my coast and waistcoat—I have the shirt I had on— producing one saturated with blood —I have never looked to see whether it is cut through—I persist in saying the blow was struck before I pulled his nose WILLIAM WARD I am barman at the Red Lion Holborn On Monday morning the 19th of May the prisoner came in with a female—he was talking to her about the watchman accusing him of taking a purse out of the pocket of a pawnbroker—he swore against the prosecutor s life—he said the moment the watchman stopped his bread he would stop the watchman s wind—he swore what he would do with him if he got hold of him—the moment Dowling came in the prisoner caught hold of him and said Joe you are a b - - y old rogue —he caught hold of him by the neckerchief and held him down on the ground strangling him holding him by the neckerchief and pulling the upper part of it—he held him to until he was black in the face—I called out to him but he did not loosen him—I called to him again and then went to run round the bar and he allowed him to get up—after that there was a deal of swearing the prisoner swore two or three times over and said several times that the moment he stopped his bread he would stop his wind—after that Dowling moved towards a desk at the end of the bar from the prisoner—there was a deal of talking between them about this robbing the pawnbroker and the prisoner laid hold of Joe and Joe laid hold of his nose—I was busy at work and was not aware after seeing him get off the floor that anything but angry words was going on and did not pay attention to it—the prisoner aecused Joe of having sent him to Bow-street for taking the pawnbroker s purse—Joe said It served you right and he wrung him by the nose and at that time I certainly saw a great deal of fumbling about the chest—the prisoner struck Joe on the breast I mean and the moment he finished that he ran out leaving the woman behind—it was not a gentle blow—it was a sort of thumping with both hands while Joe had hold of his nose—I did not perceive that the prisoner was drunk in the least—I had never seen him before Cross-examined Q You do not know what he is A He had a cabman s badge on—by stopping his bread he meant taking away his license—it was mentioned before to the female something about the license because it would be put on his license about his being sent to Bow-street—Dowling took the prisoner by the nose after he got off the ground—the prisoner was striking him on the breast at the time he had hold of his nose—they were both scuffling together—I am hardly able to tell which laid hands on the other first—it was at the same time he had hold of him by the nose at the time he was striking him on the chest—when I saw them one had the other by the nose and the other was striking him on the chest—he struck him two or three times—I think with both hands—it was a sort of pummelling—they were close together—I saw no violent blow COURT Q Did you see any knife A I did not—after the prosecutor got up he moved towards the desk the prisoner went towards him whether he caught hold of him before the prosecutor siezed his nose I cannot say—I could not say whether the prisoner caught hold of him first or the watchman of him—I had my back towards them cleaning the brass work—when I heard the scuffle I turned round and at that time one was holding the other s nose and the other pummelling his chest—I did not notice whether the prisoner appeared excited—I heard the prosecutor say his thumb was cut—I did not see it—a woman gave him a piece of handkerchief to wrap it up with GRACE GIBLING I am the wife of James Gibling a coachman—five weeks ago this morning as I was going along Holborn at six o clock the prisoner called me from the opposite side of Holborn to the corner of Red Lion-street—we went into the public-house together—he was telling me he was much hurt in consequence of a watchman s accusing him of a robbery on Mr Crocket the pawnbroker at the corner of Dean-street and it was old Joe the watchman who caused him to be brought into the station house and given in charge of a policeman—he said that he did not appear against him he was too late—I do not think it was named when—we were not taking any refreshment we had not time for at that instant the watchman came in and the prisoner said Joe you are a d—d old rogue if you stop my bread I will stop your wind or something to that effect—a scuffle ensued between them and the watchman was knocked down on his back by the prisoner—I cannot tell how it was done in an instant—my back was towards them—when he was down the prisoner caught him by the neck handkerchief—I was not close enough to see whether he held it loosely or tight but I insisted on his letting him get up which he did and the watchman stood with his back to the door—I looked at his face and it began to look a little black—I told him so and he let him get up by my persuasion—another scuffle ensued and the watchman was down again but I did not see that Q Why not interfere to prevent this A I did interfere because his face looked black—I persuaded the prisoner to let him get up and he did so instantly—he let go and let him get up—as soon as he got up he pot his back by a little desk by the door and another scuffle ensued but I was at a little distance and what followed I did not see for I was very much confused to see it—the prisoner went out directly—I went out afterwards—I was present the whole time—I cannot tell what happened at the second scuffle—I saw nothing more than a scuffle between them—the watchman got hold of the prisoner s nose—I could not see whether the prisoner put his hand on him after he got to the desk—my back was towards them—the prisoner s back was to me and the prosecutor s face towards me—they seemed quiet then—I did not notice whether both the prisoners hands were down—I saw no more than the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner s nose—the prisoner s back was to me—I was going out at that instant and the prisoner went out at the other door—I did not see more than I have named—the watchman came across and the prisoner went instantly out of the house—the watchman sat down and seemed much confused and pale—he called for a pint of porter and asked me to drink I put my lips to it and wished him good morning Cross-examined Q You have known the prisoner some time A I have known the family for years—he is a cab-driver—he said his licence would be taken away on the 1st of June—it had not been taken away at this time—I know nothing about his character—I know his parents are respectable and I never saw any harm of him COURT Q Did you see where the prosecutor was wounded A No I saw a little blood on the left thumb—I said How did you happen to get that —he said he thought it was done in the scuffle—I tore my handkerchief and gave him a bit of it to wrap round it MR BALDWIN Q What sort of a wound was it A Merely a scratch—it might have been done by the teeth while he was pulling his nose ALFRED KING I am a surgeon and live in Gray s-inn-lane On Monday morning the 19th of May between ten and eleven o clock 1 went to the prosecutor s and found him lying down by the side of the bed with his clothes on—he wan in a fainting state from loss of blood—I saw blood coming from his shirt—I examined his breast immediately and saw a wound in the centre of his breast on the bone of the sternum—it was about an inch and a half or two inches long and went to the bone—it was not very deep—there is not much flesh in that part—it was an incised wound such as would be inflicted by a cutting instrument—there appeared to have been a great deal of hemorrhage—I examined the surface of the bone with a probe—there were two arteries wounded—pressure stopped the bleeding—I was obliged to open the wound a little to secure the arteries—that gave me an opportunity of viewing the bone underneath and I could see it had been wounded slightly with the point of a knife—it must have been a violent blow going through the clothes and to the bone—it is very difficult for a knife to go through a bone—there was a slight mark as if the point of a knife had touched the bone—I looking at a knife produced by Kendall —the wound might have been inflicted by this instrument Cross-examined Q You did not find more than one wound A No—it was what I call a stab—if it was struck upwards or downwards it would produce a wound of that length—if you held the knife upwards I should call it a stab—the knife is not sharp both ways that is the reason I suppose it was given either up or down—I should say it was caused by a knife like this—I should say it was given with a thrust—there must certainly have been some cutting to make that length of wound—I think considerable force must have been used—I judge of that from the mark on the bone and it having gone through the clothes—two small arteries were wounded—they might be an inch apart—the wound being an inch or an inch and a half long there might have been two or four arteries in the neighbourhood and the knife running down might have wounded them COURT Q Did you ever know a stab without cutting A There must be a stab to be a cut—if I were to stab a man I should cut him—if the knife was not drawn out quite straight it would enlarge the wound JOSEPH KENDALL policeman On the 19th of May I was on duty in Gray s-inn-lane—the prosecutor s sister-in-law came to me and I went and took the prisoner into custody in Rose-alley at his lodging on Monday—I took him to the station searched him and took this knife out of his right hand trowsers pocket—I told him the charge at his lodging—he said he was there about six o clock in the morning but knew nothing of it—I have produced the prosecutor s clothes—I took the coat and waistcoat myself from his room—he was lying in the bed without his shirt—the surgeon was dressing his wound—the whole of the clothes were congealed with blood Caleb Robinson of George-street Lambeth

disfigure him —2nd Count stating their intent to be to do him some grievous bodily harm and that Carney bad been before convicted of felony MESSRS BODKIN and CLARK conducted the Prosecution EDWARD BURGESS police-constable H 198 On Thursday evening the 13th of Nov about half-past eight o clock I was on duty in the Whitechapel-road—I saw a horse and cart drive up to the King s Arms publkshoase witk two parties in it who I knew to be the associates of thieves—one of them named Myers I had in custody about two years ago—I did not know the other man s name but I knew his person—in consequence of seeing this cart I called Bray a brother constable and told him to take charge of the horse and cart while I went into the public-house—the two persons dismounted from the cart and went into the public-house—I was about four or five yards from the cart at that time—I saw in the cart a truss of hay a bundle of straw and a sack containing something I do not know what—a person they call Ratty came out of the public-house—I knew him to be the associate of thieves—he took hold of the horse by the head—I then went into the public-house and saw a great number of persons there from fourteen to twenty but I did not see the two that had been in the cart—I knew a great number of them by sight in fact I knew them all though not by name but they are all always in company with thieves a regular gang of them—I then came out of the house and said Bray we must take this horse and cart to the station —I then took hold of the horse and Bray also—Bray was standing at the horse s head at the time I came out—he had a view of the contents of the cart—when we took hold of the horse s head from fourteen to twenty persons rushed out of the public-house and surrounded us—they called out Don t let the b - - s take it —Myers and the other man whose name I do not know but whom I had seen at first got into the cart—I saw him come out of the house—Myers drove it away—Carney made an attempt to get up he got on the step but came down again—several of them said Whip their b - - hands off cut their be hands off —I saw all the three prisoners—Barnett said tome Mr Burgess let the horse and cart go it belongs to him pointing to Myers who was in the cart—I knew Barnett before—I said I shan t let the horse and cart go it roust go to the station —several of them cried out Don t let it go don t let them take it —Carney said Won t you let it go T—at the time I saw Lewis close by Carney at the side of the cart—I was standing close by the horse s head—I had hold of it—Lewis struck me twice or three times in the breast with his fist not very severely it did not hurt me much—I continued hold of the horse and shortly after Carney gave me a blow across the face with a pen-knife—it cut part of my nose off and left it hanging down—I could see the blade of the knife—he gave me a second blow on the left temple and cut me severely—it bled very much—he also gave me a slight cut in the neck but not much—I think that was from another blow—I cannot say whether received three blows—I found this slight cut in the neck when I got to the hospital—I was taken away by two men to a doctor s shop and got the wounds dressed—I should say Lewis was standing by me for about ten minutes or better—he was close by Carney at the time I was taken away—I should say he was there at the time the cuts were given I saw him—he had on a brown coat—the second cut was immediately after the first—as soon as he struck the first he came back and gave me the second—it was done all in a second—I have known Barnett about three or four years—I have seen him frequently during that period—I think to the best of my knowledge he had on a brown Taglioni coat on this occasion—I have been well acquainted with him and seen him very often—I have known Carney about twelve months—I have seen him frequently and have frequently seen him in the King s Arms—I have known Lewis I should say better than twelve months—I have seen him frequently up and down Whitechapel—I have not the least doubt of the persons at any of the prisoners—I was ten days in the hospital and am an out-patient at present Carney Q Where abouts did you meet the horse and cart A At the King s Arms—I saw it drive up to the door—I cannot say that I saw you come out of the house—I went and took hold of the horse s head and then I saw you—I am quite sure you had a knife in your hand—I saw the blade—I did not see the handle—it was a large-sized penknife—I did not see you draw it—you were standing close by me you and Lewis—I was holding the horse with my right hand when I was struck—I was struck before I was stabbed—I turned round to sec the person that struck me—it was not then I was stabbed—it was when I turned round again—I am sure you are the person that stabbed me—I became insensible after two stabs and two men took me to the doctor s—they are not here—I suppose there were from 400 to 500 persons round at the time—the street was filled with people—I called for assistance but no one came to assist me—there were too many of your party there and the people were frightened to come—I do not suppose any respectable shopkeeper would venture to come forward there was such a desperate lot—I drew my staff—I had no opportunity of using it you took good care of that—I bad it out nearly all the time—I struck no one with it I could not get an opportunity you prevented me—I was some time at the horse s else that I know of—I suppose I was from twenty minutes to half an hour at the horse s head—I did not remain a moment after I was stabbed—it was not you alone that assaulted us it was all your gang you had got I suppose about twenty to assist you while we only had our two selves—I saw you in conversation with the others inside the house not outside Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When the persons said Whip their b - - hands off they also said Whip the horse did not they A Yes—I am quite sure Barnett was there—he spoke to ice—I cannot say he was there when I was cut—he was on the kerb-stone when he spoke to me COURT Q Was Lewis there when you were cut A He was close to Carney Lewis Q When you came into the public-house what part was I in A I did not take notice I did not delay a moment inside you might hare been in the parlour—I had my staff drawn when you struck me—I could not get an opportunity to strike you or to use my staff because you all pressed too tightly on me JOSEPH BRAY police-constable H 43 I was called by Burgess in front of the King s Arms White-chapel-road about half-past eight o clock on the night in question—I saw a horse and cart at the door—there was no one in it when I came up—Carney was standing by it—Burgess went into the house—he might be gone a minute and a half or two minutes before he came back—I saw on the top of the cart some hay a bundle of straw and a sack full of something but the bed of the cart was full underneath the straw—I knew Carney before—when Burgess came out he said Bray we must take this horse and cart round to Spital fields station —Burgess and I took hold of the horse for the purpose of doing so—we were in the act of turning the horse s head round when Carney seized horse of it—we had not succeeded in turning it round—about fifteen or twenty persons came out of the King s Arms at the time—that was while Carney had hold of the horse—we all three had hold of it—among those who came out I noticed Lewis and several more not yet in custody—I did not see Barnett at that time—there were cries of Cut their b - - hands off don t let them take it —that was repeated more than once or twice—I cannot say whether any expressions of that kind were used by either of the prisoners—whilst I Carney and Burgess were at the horse s head I saw Lewis come off the pavement—he was the second that took hold of Burgess and me and likewise of the horse s head—he struck me two or three tires—I had then hold of the horse s head at the off side—I saw him strike Burgess in the breast more than two or three times—Burgess at that time had hold of the horse s head at the near side—I heard some one say to Burgess Let go the horse it belongs to the person in the cart but who said that I cannot say—I did not notice Burgess cut by anybody—after Lewis struck me I still kept hold of the horse s head—I was on the opposite side to Burgess but at times we were both in front by being pushed about so—Carney was on the near side the same side as Burgess—I did not notice Burgess after he was cut—while I was standing at the horse s head I was struck a severe blow from behind between the shoulders like from a stick or some heavy instrument and directly after that I missed Burgess from the horse s head—about a minute or two before I missed Burgess I saw Carney take a knife from his right hand side and open it with his left hand—about a minute or two after receiving the blow between the shoulders Barnett came from behind the cart and struck me in the left ear—I was not aware when at the police-court that my hat was cut as it is—had it not been for my hat I should have received a more severe blow—my hat is cut right round—it was done with a stick or a life-preserver I cannot say which but I saw Barnett come from the tail-part of the cart with something in his hand a foot or eighteen inches long and be struck me with that—I have known him about three years—I am positive he is the man that struck me that blow—I have not the least doubt of it—it disabled me from holding the hone—I was knocked right away from the horse—it cut me very dangerously—I was carried to the doctor s from the doctor s to the station and from there to die hospital where I remained nine days—my ear was cut from the blow—it was sewn up when I got to the hospital—two of the persons that came up got into the cart and succeeded in driving it off—I was in my uniform on duty—Burgess had his private coat on—he is in the habit of being out in plain clothes but they all knew him—I had my staff out part of the time—I took it out when I received the blow between the shoulders—Burgess had his staff hanging on his arm and I saw Carney lay hold of it and try to get it from him—I have been into this public-house several times—I was never in the back place never further than the bar—about half-past ten that night I was fetched from where I reside to go down to the station to charge Barnett who had been taken into custody by a sergeant—I saw him at the station in custody—my ear had not been sewn up then—I was taken to the hospital afterwards—some lotions had been applied to it to stop the bleeding Carney Q Whereabouts were you when you saw me draw the knife A I had hold of the horse on the off-side standing rather before the horse—I was holding the rein with my left hand—I was at the horse s head but I could see round to Burgess s side—you were not behind him but on his right side—Burgess was between you and me—I could see you take out the knife and open it—the horse and cart had been moved into the middle of the road then—it was not very dark—the lamps from the turnpike showed a light—the cart might be half-a-dozen or a dozen yards from the turnpike then—I distinctly saw you take the knife from your right side and open it with your left hand—I did not see you use it—I did not see Burgess stabbed—I saw you strike him with your hand when you reached across to take hold of the horse s head—that was almost at the commencement of it—I missed Burgess it might be a minute and a-half or two minutes after I saw you draw the knife Cross-examined Q Where was the cart at the time you received the blow A It had then got into the middle of the road perhaps ten or twelve yards from the King s Arms—when it commenced it was about two yards from the front of the King s Arms—Union-street is the first street past Whitechapel church—the King s Arms is on the left and Union-street on the right—the King s Arms is about twenty or thirty yards further down the road—I had hold of the horse s head with my left hand at the time I received the blow behind—I was looking towards the horse and cart not leading the horse along—we were stopped with it—I did not see who struck me the blow behind—that was the first blow I received—it was Barnett that struck me between the shoulders that could not have been with the fitt—in addition to that blow I received the cut in the ear—that was from Barnett—I did to hear him deny having struck me that blow—I did not hear him say anything at the station—I was merely brought there to identify him and then taken away Lewis Q Did I have hold of the horse s head when I struck you A Yes you did not let go of the horse s head to come round and strike me—you were rather at the near side of the horse s head but when you first seized the horse you were in the middle of us—Burgess and me you and Carney all four had hold of the reins at the same time—you struck Burgess first two or three times and then me three or four times—I believe Burgess had his staff drawn—I had not mine drawn then COURT Q Were you and Burgess endeavouring to retain possession of the horse A Yes—instead of resisting by blows our object was to keep the horse MR BODKIN Q Did you notice anything particular about the person or dress of Barnett that night A Yes the coat he had on then was a brown coat Sergeant Or am has it and I noticed to guard-chain about his person—it came out of some part of his waistcoat to the pocket—it appealed like a gold chain—I had noticed him wearing that same chain for some time EDWARD ORAM police-sergeant H 18 In consequence of information received I took Barnett into custody on the 13th of Nov about ten o clock in the evening near the King s Arms White-chapel-road—he had on a dark velveteen coat—he had this gold guard-chain round his neck attached to a watch in the usual way—I said Barnett I want you —he said something which I did not distinctly hear—on his way to the station he turned his head towards me and said It was you took hold of me 18 I will make you suffer for this —I told him he was in Custody for the assault on the constable—he said You need not tell me that I know what it is for I can prove where I was at the time Cross-examined Q Did you go to his house A No—I believe Inspector Done again went about the coat—I did not go with him—I have the coat MR CLARK Q What coat is it A A brown coat—it was delivered up to me at the station this morning as the one Done again brought from the house—I received it from the sergeant on duty at the station to which Baroett was taken in the inspector s room GEORGE TREW City police-constable No 26 In consequence of instructions I received I apprehended Carney on the evening of the 15th of Nov at the corner of Liverpool-street Bishops-gate-street—he was along with several others—I had only been looking for him that evening—I took him to the station and told him he was charged with cutting and wounding a policeman named Burgess up in White-chapel on Thursday evening last—he said I can prove that I was not in London I was in the country from Monday night last till Friday night and on Thursday night 1 was thirty miles from London Carney Q Do you recollect what part of the country I told you I was in A You did not name any part—you did not name Stoney Stratford nor say from forty-nine to fifty miles—you said thirty miles as plain as you could speak—when I first took you I told you I wanted a gentleman to look at you about a little spaniel dog—you said if that was the case you would go along with me—I searched you at the station and found 103 6rf on you—I took you to Spitalfields station—I did not bring Conway a policeman to identify you—he was not present at the time of the assault—I asked you whether you would be locked up or go to the London Hospital and see Burgess—you said you would go to the hospital and paid for a cab there—I did not step into the ward before you and say You roust not walk into the room you will disturb the patients —you walked in along with me Carney I asked you whether you would not disturb the patients as well as me and you said you could walk much lighter in consequence of my having heavy boots and you light ones you and Conway went up to Burgess s bedside I was kept five or six yards away and what passed between you I do not know only you said Burgess I have Carney in charge as much as to say I have got a person in charge whom you must swear to Witness It is false—before either of us spoke Burgess saw you and jumped out of bed saying You murdering villain or hound or something like that—I was behind you—I did not say I had you in custody—I never mentioned your name—I did not walk up to the bedside and say you would disturb the patients—I admit telling you I wanted a gentleman to look at you—I had a reason for doing so for you were along with a gang of notorious thieves—I said that to get you out of their company and I would not tell you the charge till I got you to the station MR BODKIN Q Had you any communication with Burgess from the time this occurred till you took Carney into custody A No I had never seen him—I took Carney into custody from a description given of him by others—Conway is a metropolitan constable—he was not in White-chapel on the night in question—we all three went to the hospital together for the purpose of seeing Burgess—I did not make the least insinuation or communication to Burgess before Carney was shown to him—as soon as he recognised him he jumped out of bed MR PAYNE Q Were you once in the H division A Yes—I have known Barnett eight or nine years—I always found him a quiet peaceable humane man—I never heard anything in this way of him before MR BODKIN Q In what way of life is he A I have been in the habit of seeing him standing about Petticoat-lane—I do not know how he got his living COURT Q What do you know about his humane disposition A have been in the habit of seeing him daily and never heard of his being in any row or disturbance before DAVID HUDSON City police-constable No 583 I took Lewis into custody on Monday evening last the 24th of Nov —I saw him coming along with a box of tea on his shoulders in Fenchurch-street—I did not take him on this charge HENRY SHEARLEY SAUNDERS I am one of the dressers at the London hospital—on Thursday evening the 13th of Nov Burgess was brought there about half-past ten o clock—the right wing of his nose was entirely divided likewise the cartilage and he had a small punctured wound on the left temple—he was in a very weak state from loss of blood—in a state of insensibility—I have no doubt the wounds were inflicted with a cutting instrument—it was a clean cut—he suffered evidently from loss of blood Carney Q Was he brought there by anybody A By a policeman—a pen-knife would cause such wounds—I have not the slightest doubt of that Carney s Defence I am innocent of the offence I stand here accused of had I been guilty I certainly should not have remained in London or have walked through the public streets as 1 did 1 know nothing of it and was not in London at the time it took place Lewis s Defence I hope you will take my case into consideration I am an innocent man does it stand to reason that if a little man like me was between two officers they would allow me to strike them when they had their staves in their hands without seizing me or making some defence in their own behalf I was never in the mob I never had hold of the horse s reins at all and was not near them at the time it took place MR PAYNE called the following witnesses GEORGE ROSE I work for Mr Ezekiel Baker a gun-maker in Whitechapel-road and live at No 16 Three Colt-street Old Ford—I was in the crowd on the evening in question the 13th of Nov I think when this matter happened—it was from half-past eight to nine o clock—I saw the officers Bray more particularly who was at the head of the cart—I saw blows struck by persons who were at the head of the cart—I saw a man in a brown coat—he seemed to be the most active in the mob—I saw Bray directly after he was struck—I was close by him when he was struck—he stumbled over me and another person caught him by the side of me—I know Barnett by seeing him in the King s Arms and about there and I have spoken to him several times—I did not see who it was that struck Bray—I did not see Barnett there—can swear he was not close to Bray at the time—I did not see him—I did not see him at all that evening—the man in the brown coat was flourishing his an about and was at the head of the horse—that man was not Barnett I am certain—I do not know the name of that man—he seemed to me to have rather a thin face and light brown whiskers—I was not looking more particularly at him than any one else—he being the most active attracted my attention—I cannot say that I saw either Carney or Lewis—I cannot say I did not COURT Q You could not see either of the three prisoners where you stood A No I could not—I have been in Mr Baker s employ three years and a half or four years—I did not come out of the public-house—I was not in there—there was a man in the cart with a jacket and cap on—I did not know him—that was the only person I saw in the cart MARK SPITTLE I live in Raven-street I am a gun-maker in the employ of Mr Baker in White-chapel—he has from forty to fifty men working for him—I have seen Burgess and I know Barnett—I remember the cart being stopped by Burgess and Bray on the night in question—I saw Barnett that night I should say from a quarter past eight o clock till a quarter to ten in the King s And in front of the bar—he had on a black velvet shooting jacket with horn buttons—I left the King s Arms at a quarter to ten—he was there till that time—I do not say positively for every minute—he had not a brown coat on—Burgess came in while Barnett and I were at the bar and went out again—Barnett followed by his side or close to him saying the horse and cart belonged to a I person of the name of Myers—I do not know who was in the cart—I never saw the cart—I heard Barnett say the horse and cart was all right it belonged to Myers—that was as he was going out—Barnett was not outside the house two minutes at that time—I will swear that—my wife was inside standing at the bar—she was saying to Barnett Why don t you look after a house for us when Burgess came in shook hands with us and went into the tap-room—Barnett followed him—he came out again and my wife asked Burgess to drink—he said Business must be done first —Barnett was then at the back of Burgess and he said You may depend on it the horse and cart is all right it belongs to Myers MR BODKIN Q Did you ever keep the King s Arms A No—my wife did prior to my marrying her—her name was Deval—she had left the house nearly a month before I married her—I do not remember any conversation taking place in the presence of the police-sergeant about this matter since it occurred—we had some conversation with Burgess last week in front of this court—my wife did not say to the sergeant or Burgess in my presence He meaning me knows nothing about it except what I told him —I have seen Oram—my wife never said that in his presence—nothing of the sort ever happened—I went into the King s Arms about a quarter past eight o clock—I was in front of the bar—I did not sit down—I was standing all the time—my wife sat down part of the time I should expect in front of the bar—we had a glass or two of stout—there might be a score or more of persons sitting in front of the bar—I might know some few of them—Watts was there and Clark a shop mate of mine—I do not know what Watts is—I do not remember two men coming in out of a cart neither did I know anything about the cart till Burgess came in and Barnett was standing by the side of me and my wife in conversation when Burgess came in—Burgess and Barnett were in conversation and they went together through the passage into the tap-room—Barnett did not follow Burgess into the tap-room—he only went to the door and came back with Barnett when Barnett said It is all right the cart belongs to Myers —both Burgess and Barnett were inside the house when that was said—the only time Barnett went outside was with the parties belonging to the cart going to the door after Burgess and as soon as they were out Barnett was inside again and I never missed him afterwards—he was only out to admit of the others going out and then he was in again—all I heard him say was that the cart belonged to Myers—I am sure he mentioned the name of Myers—his words were Mr Burgess the horse and cart is all right it belongs to Myers —at I that time Burgess had not got hold of the horse or the cart either—I live now at No 32 Raven-street—I had seen Barnett many times before in the velveteen coat and horn buttons—I swear that he had it on that night—I never went outside the house till a quarter to ten o clock no more than going to the door when the thing was over and a quantity of people were collected by White-chapel church I mean when I heard there had been this depredation committed on the police—I saw Carney that night in the King s Arms after I the noise was over—I do not recollect seeing him before—I did not see him come into the King s Arms Q On your oath did not Carney when He came into the public-house say We have killed that by—Burgess V A I did not hear him say it—I swear that—I and my wife were in the same part of the house—after Carney came in she called me and said Did you bear that —I said What and she said They have done for Burgess —with that I went to the door and looked round the street and there was a crowd of 300 or 400 people fifty or sixty yards from the King s Arms—the bar is from six to seven yards from the street-door—you go straight up to the bar—there is no passage—it faces you directly you go in MR PAYNE Q How long have you worked for Mr Baker A Two years within a few days—before that I worked for Mr Field a gun-maker of Chambers-street for three years and that is as long as I have been in London—I did not hear Barnett say anything after he went outside—I should Bay he was not gone out long enough to have spoken to Burgess at the head of the cart—what I heard him say was inside—I do not know what he said when outside COURT Q You say he was only absent time enough to let the others pass A Yes for as the last went out he came in—I did not say he was two minutes doing that—I cannot say the time—the men went out as fast as they could and he came in as the last went out—I should say two minutes never elapsed from the time he went out ELIZA SPITTLE I am the wife of the last witness I was with my husband at the King s Arms on the night this matter happened—I saw Barnett there first about a quarter past eight o clock—he had on a black velveteen coat—he was not dressed in a brown Taglioni—it was a common coat with pockets at the side—a Taglioni is made in a similar way—I remember Burgess coming in—he passed into the tap-room—Barnett followed him—Burgess came out and Barnett also but Barnett still remained with me—I said to Burgess Will you take anything to drink —he said I are on other business —he then went out—Barnett still remained with roe—I did not hear him say anything to Burgess as he went out—Barnett remained with me I should think an hour—he did not go out at all—I never missed his a—I cannot say whether he was out for a minute or so—I never misscd him—I remember somebody coming in and saying something about Burgess—Barnett was then standing with me MR BODKIN Q Who was the person that came in A The prisoner Carney—he said We have killed that b—y Burgess —my husband was standing close by me at that time and Barnett also—I kept this house formerly for three years as a widow—it is a house of very fair business—I hart known Barnett for some time always as a very respectable man and very quiet and inoffensive—he used to frequent my house—all the persona that frequented my house were not so—he was particularly so—my acquaintance with him continued down to this time—no further than using my house—was close to the bar—I was going into the parlour but Barnett stopped me—the bar is a little way from the door—I never lost sight of him—I swear that I never lost sight of him from a quarter past eight till I should think nine or half-past—he was standing talking with me all that time and was never nearer the door than that—I never lost sight of him—I have always I been equally sure of that—I never missed him at all Q Have you not said that he might have gone out without your knowing it A Yes he might—I was speaking to him and never missed him—I do not suppose I missed him a minute—I did not miss him but in tatting to other parties he might have gone out—I do not believe he did go out—I am certain he did not go out MR PAYNE Q You say you were talking to other persons—can you any it was impossible for Barnett to have gone to the door said a word and cone back again A Well 1 should think it was impossible—I do indeed WILLIAM WATTS I live in White-chapel—I am nothing at purse it—I hate just left a public-house at Norwich—I was at the King s Arms on the night this matter happened from six till half-past nine—I saw Barnett there all the time—I do not recollect Burgess coming in—Barnett was dressed in a black velveteen coat COURT Q Did you remain in the public-house A Yes all the time till half-past nine—I saw Carney there I did not hear him say anything—I was in the front bar when he came in—Mrs Spittle was there—I only heard him call for a glass of wine—I did not hear him say a word about Burgess—I understood there was a row outside—I did not go out—I never stirred out of the door—I had known Barnett before—I have been from Norwich eight or nine months and have been out of business that time living in White-chapel—I have not been in any situation since I have been in London—I have been living on the money I sold my house at Norwich for JUDAH LYON I am a dealer in new and second-hand Brussels carpets and live at 20 Fashion-street Spitalfieids I was in the White-chapel-road passing the King s Arms and saw a policeman having hold of the horse there were eight or nine persons on the pavement but no one by the side of the policeman—the policeman was off the kerb—I saw Barnett standing by the door of the public-house with his back against the door smoking his pipe—that was from half-past eight till I should say nine—I saw no disturbance before the public-house door—the policemen went on and Barnett went into the public-house—the policemen went on with the cart about ten or fifteen yards—three or four men took hold of the cart—a scuffle took place and one of the policemen was knocked down—I did not see Barnett then—I was standing about three yards away from the place—Barnett was not there at that time—I have known him for a good many years—if he had been the person that knocked the policeman down I must have seen it—I have not spoken to him half-a-dozen words in my life—he was dressed respectably—he had on a darkish coat as I recollect—I cannot exactly say what colour— looking at the coat produced by Oram it was not such a coat as this—it was darker than that—I could not very well mistake that for a black velveteen MR BODKIN Q That would not look quite so light at night A This is not the coat he had on—I am sure of it—I swear that—I cannot tell what sort of coat the man had on that knocked the policeman down or what he knocked him down with—a scuffle took place and I saw the policeman go down with his hands up and his truncheon up—three or four men had their hands up and then the cart went away—I cannot exactly say whether the policeman was knocked down by the blow of a fist—Barnett was not by I at the time—I cannot say what instrument it was—I did not see the face of the man that knocked him down nor yet his coat—I saw his arm up—I saw several arms up—it was a regular common pipe that Barnett was smoking—he was standing with his back against the public-house door interfering with no one and talking with no one—I did not see him hardly a minute—I did not say I had seen him at the door from half-past eight till nine—I hardly saw him a minute—I do not know what caused him to go in so suddenly—he went in with his pipe in his hand—I did not notice anybody come out—when the policemen went on with the cart I went on the pavement—the cart was going on while Barnett was standing there with his pipe—the officers had hold of the horse s head—I did not see Barnett say anything to the officers—I am quite sure he did not—I cannot tell whether any one did come out of the public-house—I saw Barnett go in—I saw no one come out—I was not there above two minutes altogether—when I saw a mob of people there I stopped a minute—there might be twelve persons for what I know—I should say there were about fifty round the cart not exactly at the time I saw the officer drop because the horse pranced up a little as if the man in the cart was pulling and the people were scattered round about four or five yards away from the cart—the police had hold of the horse and so had three or four other men I—I did not see the policeman with his nose cut—I saw Bray on the ground with the back part of his neck bleeding—when the cart went away I went home—I did not go into the public-house—I did not go and help to pick the man up—I sometimes keep a stock of carpet—I have a little now—about 1l or 2l worth of old—I deal with persons who come to my place brokers in Middlesex-street White-chapel—persons bring in things and come to me to go to their place to buy—Middlesex-street is not more than five minutes walk from my place and when they think they have anything to suit me I go to their place—I live along with my brother-in-law he rents the house—it goes in his name—I occupy the shop and parlour—Middlesex-street is the place called Petticoat-lane—I have known Barnett I should say twenty years—I cannot tell what his business is COURT Q Have you seen him in Middlesex-street A Not to my knowledge—I never spoke to him half-a-dozen words MR PAYNE Q Were you going by the public-house or had you been in it A Going by—when I said this was from half-past eight till nine I did not mean to say that Barnett stood at the door half an hour—he went in jett as the cart had got a little way off JURY to JOSEPH BRAY Q What view had you of Barnett at the time he struck you A I had hold of the horse with my left hand and in the act of turning to the right to take hold of the near side I saw Barnett come from behind the cart the full-length of the horse and cart—I saw him come the whole length of the horse and cart toward me and when he was about the middle of the cart I saw the stick or life-preserver in his hand—he rose it up—I was then in the act of being shoved round when I received the blow on the ear—I cannot say whether it was a life-preserver or a stick —it was about a foot or eighteen inches long—there are different sorts of life-preservers—some are loaded with lead and have a cord round them and some catgut—some are dark and some covered with leather—there was sufficient light for me to see Barnett—there are six or seven lamps at the turnpike which was not ten yards off—I never entertained any doubt of Barnett being the man who struck me—as soon as I got to the station-house I was asked who did it and I directly described Barnett as being the man—I gave his name as well JOSEPH DALTON City-policeman No 366 I

door about three minutes— I returned to the table and observed that my wife had put all the milk into my tea—I had poured some tea into a tea-cup for my wife and into a little tin pot for my child—there was some milk in a tea-cup when I left the table and when I came back all the milk had been poured into my mug—I asked her what she had put all the milk into my tea for—she said Did not you want it all in your tea —I told her I did not I never had anything without she had part of it—I poured the tea into the saucer—the saucer was full—I drank almost all of it—I felt it burn me in the throat—it was a very strong acid—I asked her what she had put into my tea—she said Nothing —I said if she did not tell me I would go to the doctor and ask him what she had put into it—I took the mug with the rest of the tea in it—I went to the door then returned to the table and asked her to let me feel in her pocket—she refused—I put the mug of tea on the tray—I proceeded to search her pocket and after once or twice she let me feel in her pocket—I pulled out some white powder on my fingers—I showed her my hand with the powder on it and asked her what it was—she said it was oxalic acid as well as she could repeat the words—I asked her to untie her pocket—she said she would not—I said if she did not I would cut it from her side which I did—I examined it and kept it till I handed it over to the police-constable just as I took it from her side—I took the mug of tea to my father s and left it there—I took the pocket to Mr Vane the doctor before I gave it to the constable—Mr Vane wanted to take it but I did not let it go out of my hand—he put his hand into it took some of the powder out and told me what it was—while I was there my father came in with the mug of tea and placed it on the counter—Vane gave me some medicine—I brought the pocket home again and left the mug of tea on the counter—I returned home and found my wife and my father with her—I fetched a constable and gave her in charge—I then said I had been to the doctor—I asked her for what reason she bought the oxalic acid if it was with a view of destroying me—she said Yes —I said And yourself —she said Yes —I said And your two children she said Yes to all these questions COURT Q Were you at that time in great distress A No—I had work—I have not been distressed for a day s work for eight months—we lived happily together up to within the last fortnight—I believe I am the father of the eldest child Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Have you struck her A Yes hut never to hurt her—I was not in the habit of striking her—it is a good while since I struck her—I will swear I never kicked her—I did not kick her in a very tender part of her person not long before—I tore her cloak off her back because she wanted to go to her mother s—her mother has been the instigation of it all—it was my cloak—I did not strike or kick her—I swear I never kicked her—I can swear she kicked me—the children began crying but not because I treated her so—we were married in Oct —she was not at her mother s some time after that—she lived with me in a furnished room till Christmas—I did not send her to the workhouse—she was obliged to go there through my being out of employment—it was better to go there than to have died—it is two years and seven months since she went there—it was before we were married—I do not know How long we lived together before we were married—I did not pawn her clothes after we were married—she pawned them herself not to support herself—it was when I was out of work and my own clothes were pawned—she pawned the children s clothes also because I could not get work COURT Q You said you never wanted a day s work A No more I have for the last eight months MR DOANE Q Did not she complain to her mother about your beating her with a strap A She may have done so—she can take a false oath as well as any one—I never threatened that I would do for her—I never used any threats at all or any kind of violence—I have called her a b - - w - - I did not beat her on the last Thursday in July till she went and pawned the kettle—I never beat her at all—there was not a blow struck—the baby s things were pawned on the Friday because I had not been to the warehouse and had no work—I do not call that being in distress—all people are liable to that—I did not on that day kick her while she was lighting the fire—I did not kick or strike her at all THOMAS VANE I am assistant to Mr Bowen a surgeon in the Curtain-road About four o clock on Friday afternoon the 24th of July the prisoner came to my shop and asked for a pennyworth of oxalic acid—I wrapped up half an ounce in white paper and labelled it Oxalic acid—poison —there was quite sufficient to destroy life—I gave it her and she went away—in about half an hour her husband came—he brought a woman s pocket in his hand—I put my hand into it and found some small chrystals which I examined and found to be oxalic acid—after that Joseph Barker came with a mug three parts full of tea—I kept it as he brought it till I and Mr Bowen analyzed it—we detected the presence of oxalic acid—I am quite sure of that—I tasted it—I gave the prosecutor some chalk—he began to spit very much after it and the saliva was rather frothy which would be the result of having taken oxalic acid Cross-examined Q How much did you find in the pocket A About a quarter of an ounce—I weighed her half an ounce—there might have been more than half of it left—I did not see the tea-pot—I did not examine any other vessel with tea in it but that brought to me—I cannot from that judge what quantity the prosecutor had taken but it must have been a very small quailtity—about a quarter of an ounce would produce sickness if it remained in the stomach—he must have taken much less than that—if a person took two mugs of it it would produce sickness and killed him if it remained in the stomach—the small quantity he took would not have killed him—if he had taken the whole it would decidedly have destroyed him—I did not say anything to the prisoner when she bought it—it is used to clean brass and other things by almost every housekeeper—it is commonly used for domestic purposes—I bad not known her before—I remarked her features particularly—I did not see her again till the next day at Worship-street—I recognized her immediately—I have no doubt of her—I cannot say whether that is the only oxalic acid I sold that day—I never noticed the prosecutor in my shop except when he brought the pocket—I did not recollect his features—I had sold a goodish quantity of oxalic acid that week to women and men and children too—my shop has pretty much traffic—I might have sold the husband some oxalic acid without recollecting it JOSEPH BARKER The prosecutor is my son—on Friday afternoon 24th July about half-past four o clock he brought a mug of tea to my place—I took it out of his hand and followed him with it to Mr Vane s—I left it there on the counter to have it analyzed—I then went to my son s house and found the prisoner there crying—I put my hand on her knee and said My dear How could you think of doing such a cruel thing as this — my son was gone for a policeman at the time —she said I meant to destroy him and should not have been long after him and myself and the two children —I lire two doors from them—they were not in greater distress than they usually were—the work in our trade is not good—he always paid his way and made no applica tion for any relief in any way—the policeman came while I was there and she was taken away Cross-examined Q Was not she iri the habit of pawning her clothes and the children s A Yes it is a usual thing among all poor people—she may have taken her baby s clothes to pawn but I was very seldom there and did not see much of his conduct towards her—they used to live pretty comfortably as far as I saw—I did not see her above once a fortnight or once a week—when she made the statement there was nobody but ourselves and the two children in the room—they are young JOHN SEAREY police-constable H 129 On Friday the 24th of July tlie prisoner was given into my charge by the prosecutor—he gave me a pocket which I produce—I have had it ever since—the prosecutor asked her in my presence How she came to give him the poison—she said she intended to do it for the whole—she did not say what she meant by the whole Cross-examined Q Was she in a state of great distress and excitement A She appeared very much hurt in her feelings HARRIET HAYWARD I am female-searcher at Featherstone-street station-house—on Friday evening the 24th of July the prisoner was brought thereon my proceeding to search her she said God bless you search me I have nothing about me —I found nothing on her—she then said I was brought here by my husband for attempting to poison him but I did not give him sufficient to kill him for he is here to prosecute me I meant to give my children some as they should not be cuffed at but I am sorry now I did not take it myself —she said It was through my husband s ill-usage and treatment that caused me to do it for that afternoon he had beat her a pood deal—she told me to examine her back and I should see the bruises—I examined her back and saw bruises at the bottom of her back and on a small part of the shin of her leg—she also had a black eye—she said her husband gave her the bruises the day before—she appeared so much distressed I was obliged to support her with one arm while I pulled her clothes off with the other Cross-examined Q She appeared very much excited A Very much indeed GUILTY on the 2nd Count —Recommended to mercy on account of the treatment of her husband — Transported for Ten Years

saw him put his hand into his pocket after a person came to assist me on pretence—he got the prisoner on his legs—then he let go of him and walked away—it was then I saw him put his hand into his pocket and I felt him jobbing at my body immediately after that—I defended myself with my arm—I was standing at the time and endeavoured to protect myself by my arm and I received eight wounds on my arm—I am quite sure they were inflicted by the prisoner—they could not have been inflicted by anybody else—I cried out at the time He is stabbing me —we had a struggle after he stabbed me —I threw him down again—he fell on his belly and I on his back—I held his collar with my legs round him and M Michen came up and secured him—I got no further stabbing while on the ground—we were standing up at the

standing up when he struck me—he had not a chance of striking when I knelt on him—nobody else held him—some one came up but I would not let him take hold of him—I expect his accomplice got hold of him

would not allow him—he first said I will assist you policeman —he took hold of his collar and I took hold of his arm—he took hold of his right arm and as soon as the prisoner got up he went away—the

he was lying with his belly on the ground—I do not know whether he was nearly fainting—I was—I had hold of his left collar when he was striking at me—I did not attempt to take hold of his right arm or I should have lost him altogether—I could only hold him by one arm and defend myself with the other—I did not attempt to take anything out of his right hand because I had no strength in this arm at all—I did not attempt to see what he had in his hand or take it from it because I was not going to cur my fingers—I did not search him afterwards—I have my coat here COURT Q How were his arms when lying down on his belly would he have his right arm at liberty could he have cast anything from it in the state he was in A I think his accomplice came and took the knife from his—he had an opportunity of passing the knife to him for he came close to him and I said Stand off or you will get yourself into trouble —he stooped and wanted to assist him up—here is my coat—there are six cuts in it—I have one on my wrist so that he might have cut me below the cuff and one on the bone of my thumb—the deepest wound I believe is the one nearest the elbow JAMES M MICHEN police-constable H 131

o clock Pettet called on me—from what he stated I examined his left arm and found it had been previously dressed by a surgeon—on re-moving the dressing I discovered he had received eight punctured wounds in The fore-arm one about an inch below and on a line with the inner part of the elbow which I considered important as regards its depth—a second was situated about the middle of the inner side of the fore-arm which I considered still more important form the injury sustained by the nerve which supplies the inner part of the arm—there was another wound over the anterior surface of the wrist another on the ball of the thumb which I considered important from their locality being situated over the principal arteries of the hand—they all appeared to have been done by some small-pointed sharp instrument such as a penknife—he has been under my care till the present time—the wounds have healed but he still suffers form loss of sensation in the inner part of the arm consequent on the injury to this nerve—it will be some time before he gets the perfect use of his arm Cross-examined Q Only one of them seemed to be a serious wound A None of them have turned out so—they might or might not have been serious—I did not expect he would have recovered so soon from them—he has almost recovered COURT Q What was the depth of the wound A The one by the elbow was a quarter of an inch deep—it was important because the artery runs along there—it would require no great force to make the wounds—it had to penetrate a thick coat an under-coat and a flannel jacket which probably broke the force of the world HENRY FINNIS policeman I saw the prisoner drop the bundle and run away—I have it here and produced it in the last case JOHN MAURICE This is the bundle containing the things that I had in my cart on that night and which I lost between Whitechapel church and Worship-street MR PARNELL to GEORGE PETTET Q What sort of man was this that pretended to come to your assistance how was he dressed A In the same way as the prisoner s brother-in-law was dressed who came to give him a character—I cannot swear he was the man but he was dressed in that way in a black coat—he looked a respectable man

do grievous bodily harm —4th COUNT that he being armed with certain weapons did assault with intent to rob her MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution SUSANNAH I am the wife of Henry Matthew Haines a painter—we live in a cottage at the back of Paradise-terrace Liverpool-road Islington He never works at home—he usually comes home about dusk between six and seven o clock except on Saturday nights when he is later—we were both acquainted with the prisoner—he was in the habit of coming to see us—on Saturday evening the 14th of Nov he came to the cottage between five and six o clock—it was dusk—my husband was not at home—our cottage is lonely—he tapped at the window—I said Who is there —he said It is me —I knew his voice well and opened the door and said to him Are you alone —he said Yes —I said Is anything the matter seeing him alone as he never came to our house except the night before without a person I thought was his wife —he said No —he came in and said I came to ask if you had such a thing as a bit of paint to give me —I said I have not such a thing in the house —he put his back to the door—I did not ask him in as I wondered at seeing him alone but he stepped in on the mat asked me for the paint put his back against the street door and pushed it to and it fastened—he kept rubbing his hands—he said he had been putting a bit of wood up at home and wanted to colour it—he walked into my sitting-room which is the next room and said I have been over to Newington again he had said on Thursday that he had been to Newington to pay the interest on some pledges as he had not money enough on Friday and was obliged to again—I said Why did you not say so when here yesterday I would have given you enough to save you the journey that night —he said I was too tried — I said Will you like to sit down and take a pipe as my husband and he often smoked together—he said Thank you and I gave him a pipe and tobacco—after he had smoked a short time I was putting some meat into the pot on the fire which I had just brought in for my husband s supper having my things on—he said You will not have your husband s supper ready —I shall it is not more than six o clock I do not expect him till between eight and nine —he said You have got your things on I am keeping you —I said It does not matter for a quarter of an hour or so while you rest —I was then putting the meat into the pot on the fire—it was necessary to turn round to do so which I did—he stood close to me and when I rose up my head after doing so he was standing close to me with his hands in his trowsers pocket and a pipe in his mouth—my eye caught his and he gave me a dreadful look which I could not understand—I became quite flurried and turned back about two steps towards the window—I heard his step behind me and received a most tremendous blow on the top of my head—I was half round the table at that time—he followed me round the table—I had a light burning on the table—the first thing I observed after he followed me was a tremendous blow on my head and the light went out at the same moment—the blow was from some substance—I should not think it was a fist—he never spoke—I screamed Murder and made to the front door as well as I could and before I could get more than half a yard I received another blow—I then got to the front door—I received another blow before that—I then tried to get my hand on the latch to open the door—he turned me from the door and pushed me into the corner of the room by the window and there repeated the blows I cannot say how many times—after striking me a great many times he caught hold of me and tore my bonnet off and tried to tear my throat open—I thought I was struggling for my life and seized him by his head thinking it was the last struggle—I held his head under my arm by the hair and got to the door—I was sensible enough to know I had his head under my arm—I was crying Murder all the time and when I got the door open my cries were heard —I kept my feet for a few yards after I got out of the door and then was caught in the arms of a witness—I was afterwards attended by a surgeon—the prisoner was taken and brought to me towards morning and I knew him directly—when he called on the Friday asked me what sort of Christmas I thought I should pass—I said I do row my husband is going home to see his friends and I must spend mine after he comes back he has a father and mother in the country —he said That will be expensive —I said Yes I dare say it will cost 5l or 6l it seems a pity to spend money in that way that is hard earned but he is a very solid man and does not spend money —about a month or more ago I had a conversation with him about a robbery in the cottage of Gilbert whom he knew well—I was speaking about their being robbed while we were both out—he said It was a good thing they did not rob your house —I said If they had broken into my place they could not have taken anything but clothes as what money I have I always carry about me —he said It is a wonder you carry it about you there are so many robberies —I said Well I always do and it would not be taken from me without my life —I never had any quarrel with the prisoner—I have occasionally lent him money of my husband s a sovereign at a time—the prisoner never spoke a word from beginning to end during his attack on me—I bled a good deal and was wounded Prisoner Q Did you not go into the yard to get me some paint A No—I had none Q On what occasion did you lend me money A Your Wife as I thought her had asked me for a sovereign in your presence—I went Once with Constantine to look for a cottage for you—I lent your wife a sovereign to pay the last quarter s rent—I saw you at Christmas 1845 and as we went home my husband said he thought you were in distress and if half-a-sovereign would do you good he wished he had let you have it—I said I would get up next morning and take it to you which I did—when I got there I said Did you see anything of my purse —you said No —I said Well you stated you were in distress my husband told me to bring you half-a-sovereign —it was said you were in want of food—I know nothing about your opening a shop Q You say I gave you a strange look A You had a horrible look which I shall never forget—the moment you gave me the blow the candlestick went on the floor—when you were brought to me to be identified I said you were the man—I had known you five years—I said You have left me just life enough to speak which you thought you had not RICHARD GILBERT I live in the same sort of cottage as the prosecutrix On the 14th of November I was at home—it was very dark—at six o clock while I was sitting in my cottage I heard a sort of stifled shriek which afterwards broke out into a women s scream—I did not hear anything but screaming—I was too far to hear words—I went out directly in the direction in which I heard the screams—I ran against the prosecutrix pushed her down but caught hold of her and prevented her going to the ground—we were running in opposite directions—I found her bleeding and said Who is it —she did not seem sensible enough to answer but kept calling out Murder —she was covered with blood her neck bosom and every thing—at the time I ran against her I heard footsteps running from the immediate spot going towards the end of the alley—this is the bonnet she had on—it was in this state With blood on it then—I took her into her own cottage and on the door-post of the cottage I observed blood spirted and also on the brick reveal which was lime-whited and showed the blood—on going into the cottage blood fell from her person—she was quite exhausted—her spirits kept her body up—in a few minutes she got round a bit—the prisoner was brought to the cottage by the police the same evening—I was down stairs and Haines and his wife were up stairs—I heard a few words pass such as Why did you do it —the first words I heard the prisoner say were Well I did it you shall know what for —I then heard him say I did it for revenge and satisfaction —Mrs Haines is a peaceable woman and respectable in her station Prisoner Q When you took her into the house where did you find the candlestick A Not in the house but outside—the candle was about two feet in the parlour burning on the carpet—it had fallen on the carpet and caused the carpet to flare HENRY MATTHEW HAINES I live in one of three cottages near Paradiseterrace It is a lonely situation—they are small cottages with three room—the nearest one to mine would be about fifteen yards—they are detached—there is no light in the alley—I have known the prisoner four years and better—on Friday the 14th of Nov I found him at the cottage on my return home—he had some tea there and staid about twenty minutes after my return—in the course of our acquaintance he knew when I was in the habit of receiving my wages—I received them at six or half-past six o clock on Saturday evenings—I am sure he was aware of that—he has been several Saturday nights and supped with us when I have received my wages and spoken of it—on this Saturday I returned home at a quarter to eight o clock and found my wife with her head dressed and four or five people in the house—her hair was all cut off and there was blood on the table—she had been seriously injured—there was a hat in the room—it was not mine—I thought it was the prisoner s—I saw the prisoner at the station the same evening—he was told in my presence that he was charged with cutting and wounding my wife—he said he had not been there he had not been at Holloway which is where we live—he afterwards said he did it for revenge and satisfaction—he looked over his left shoulder at me and said I should have done it the night before if you had not come home too soon Prisoner Q You recollect being at the house where I lived last Christmas-eve twelve months A Christmas-eve or Christmas-day I do not know which—you were about opening a little shop about that time—the shop was not at your place—my wife went next morning to lend you some money—you had not directly asked for it—you said you were in poverty that your income had fallen off—my wife has lent you money and we took a table and things in return—I think my cottage is fifteen or twenty yards from the back of Paradise-terrace WILLIAM HOWARD police-constable N 22 On the 14th of Nov in consequence of information I received I went in search of the prisoner found him in Odey-place Somers -town and watched him into a shop in Edward-street—I procured the assistance of Brennan who took him and brought him to me—I asked him if his name was Smith—he said No —Brennan asked him if he had been at the back of Pardise-terrace that night—he said No he had not been there—he was taken to the station and from there I and another constable took him to Mrs Haines cottage—he was shown to her—she said That is the man —the prisoner then said that he had done it and she knew what it was for—I produce Mrs Haines bonnet which was found in the cottage Prisoner Q Has the bonnet ever been out of your possession A I has been locked up at the station—it has in my brother constable hands—I swear it is in the same state as when I received it—I recollect leaving you with another officer—when I took you to the police—office I had a candlestick with me—I do not know whether the other constable tried to fit the candlestick into the bonnet MR CLARKSON Q Does the bonnet appear to have received dents from blows A Yes JAMES BRANNAN policeman On the 14th of Nov I took the prisoner—I told him I took him for an assault on women at back of Paradiseterrace Liverpool-road—he said he assaulted no women and did not know where it was—I asked him if he name was Bentley—he said No that was the name I had given me—I asked if he knew any person living at the back of Paradise-terrace—he said no he did not know any person there—I took him to the station and sent for Haines—the prisoner there denied assaulting anybody—he was afterwards taken to Mrs Haines s house and confronted with Mrs Haines—Mrs Haines pointed to him and said That is the man that assaulted me —he said Yes I did it and she knows what for —I said to her Do you know any cause why he should do it —she said No —he replied Idone it for revenge and satisfaction I would have done it last night only you came home too soon turning round to Mr Haines —after taking him back to the station I examined and found two spots of blood on the back of his trowsers and one on his shirts MRS HAINES re-examined Q I believe you had been out and had not taken off your things A Yes—I had my bonnet on when I received the blow RAYMOND LEVI HAYNES I am a surgeon and live at Holloway I was called on the 14th of Nov to see Mrs Haines at the cottage at the back of Paradise-terrace—I found her very much exhausted and several wounds on her head which had bled considerably but were not bleeding much then—there were five incised wounds which were also bruised—one of an angular shape which corresponded with the front hole through her bonnet—another angular one about two inches more backwards which corresponded with no hole in her bonnet—a third about two inches and a half from the centre and two on the right side—there were two contusions on the back of the head one about the size of a walnut the other not quit so large—they were serious injuries—I consider a chisel the most likely instruments to have done it—I attended her about weeks—the cuts appeared to have been inflicted with considerable violence as although the bonnet was on the scull was laid bare in three places—the hair was also cut through—I had reason to fear on the 16th that her life might be danger—there was a trifling wound on her ankle Prisoner Q What induced you to alter your opinion respecting the instrument which inflicted the wounds A I never gave a professional opinion till I was before Mr Greenwood on the 15th of Dec —I had not an recollect the Magistrate asking if the candlestick could have inflicted them—I said it was done with a chisel or plasterer s hammer which resembles a chisel very much at one end—on examining the bonnet I find both the holes are narrow and the straw requires something cutting to divide it—I am satisfied it was a sharp instrument and something narrow—it is a clean cut—the contusion might have been made at the time the wound was inflicted or by subsequent blows—the candlestick might inflict the wounds without the bonnet but not with the bonnet on—there was no blood on the candlestick Prisoner s Defence All I have to say is I certainly did go to the cottage and assault the woman but as to ever saying it was out of revenge I never did we had words about a certain person calling at the house and she said she would give me in charge of the parish officers for deserting my wife I was irritated and snatched the candlestick off the table and to make her let go gave her several chops on her back but she still held me till we got out of the house she them let me go and I walked away that is the long and short of the story GUILTY on the 3rd count Aged 28 — Transported for life Before Mr Justice Maule

and disable and to do him some grievous bodily harm MR BALDWIN conducted the prosecution ANN LONGMAN I am the wife of Zachariah Longman On the 22nd of March last we lived in Britannia-street city-road—we occupied the two parlours—the prisoner lodge in the same house in the second floor front room—on the 22nd of March last about twelve o clock at night I was with my husband in the back parlour—the prisoner came there and had some talk about the landlord—we sent for some ale—the prisoner drank one glass my husband and I parktook of it and the remainder was put into a bottle and was drank the second time the prisoner came—he went into his own room and my husband went to light him up—the prisoner came down shortly afterwards to my back door—he asked for his dog—I was making the bed and told him I had not got the dog that it was up stairs—he put up his fist at the back of my head—he did not strike me he only attempted to do so—I said What did you do that for Mr Walford —he went out into the street after that—he was not many minutes out—he came back went up stairs came down again and cried Fire in the passage—I was in the front parlour—I went out to see what was the matter and he caught me by the hair of my head and put his hands under my throat—I had only said to him that his dog was up stairs—I called out to my husband and said For God s sake take him away he will murder me —my husband came to my assistance—I saw him put his left hand to release me from the prisoner and I saw the prisoner s right hand at my husband s face—I saw my husband s face bleeding—I took him by some part of his clothes and got him into the street—he was bleeding dreadfully—the policeman came and bound up the wound—I cried out Murder and police —the prisoner left and went up stairs—they took my husband to the hospital—I was called by the the first floor lodger—I went up and found the razor now produced on the landing between the doors of the back and front rooms on the first floor—I gave it to the policeman—I do not know whether this is it—it was a black handled one—there was a little blood on the blade—I saw some wet spots of blood on the landing-place where the razor was—I could not judge whether it was from the razor or not—it was only a very small quantity Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q I believe you or you husband went out for some dog s-meat for him A No he asked me to go and find his dog—he said he would go out and busy some dog s-meat himself—he is married and has a family—we never had any words before—I have been in the habit of taking in letters and messages for him and his wife ZACHARIAH LONGMAN On the night of the 22nd of March my wife called for my assistance—I ran to her—she was in the passage with the prisoners—I did not speak to the prisoner—he took both hands came at me and cut me on the side of the head—I was carried to the hospital on a stretcher—the wounds found on me at the hospital were what the prisoner then inflicted Cross-examined Q Were you struggling with him at the time you received the wounds A Yes to prevent his coming at my wife—he had her by the throat—she was crying out For God s sake come and assist me JOHN BEMERSIDE HAIG I was house-surgeon at St Bartholomew s Hospital on the 23rd of March between one two o clock in the morning when Longman was brought there—he was in a very exhausted state from loss of blood—there was a wound on the left side of his head and face about four inches long—the centre was deep the ends were superficial—it cut through one of the branches of the temporal artery—he was bleeding very profusely—there was a wound on the forehead just above the nose about two inches in length extending to the bone a superficial wound on the left eye-brow and three or four smaller wounds of a slight character about the head and face—he was in the greatest danger from loss of blood from the wound which dividend the temporal artery and from that over the nose—such an instrument as this razor would inflict the wounds—I should conclude that the wound on the face was about the length of the razor-blade—it is quite healed but you can see where it was very plainly—the razor has a very long shaft or holder—it could be held so as to inflict this wound without a man s cutting his own hand or without its giving way GEORGE BAYNES ploice-constable N 51 I went to prisoner s room and found him lying on the bed with a wound on his neck—after a short time he said I have done it and my own neck is cut also —I said nothing to him to induce him to say that—I have produced the razor which I got from Mr Longman—I saw a small mark of wet blood about three or four inches long on the landing—there were a great many spots of blood in different places on the stairs leading to the prisoner s room—Longman s wound was dressed and he was taken to the hospital Cross-examined Q You found the prisoner lying on the bed and his head hanging down A Hanging over the side of the bed—his back was towards me—I spoke to him twice and ultimately found his throat was cut and bleeding—he did not say in my presence that if the razor had been good enough he should have finished it ROBERT COX police-constable N 60 I went up stairs and found the prisoner with his neck cut—I said What did you cut the wound in your throat with —he said with a razor but the razor cut b—y bad or else he would have done for himself—Mr Coward s assistant was called in to him—he said he was very sorry he had injured the old man as he had not given him the least provocation—he said he had thrown the razor with which he wounded himself out of the window—it could not be found in the street COURT Q Was there any blood in the room in which he was lying that appeared to have come from his throat A Yes there was a quantity about the bedstead and bed clothes and on his shirt and waistcoat—there was none outside the door—it was all inside the room on the floor close to the bed as though the wound had been made in the bed with the head projecting WILLIAM TYSON I am assistant to Mr Coward surgeon of St John s-terrace I was called in to dress a wound on the left side of the prisoner s neck—it was about half an inch long simply cutting through the integuments the skin and the outer fat but no parts of consequence were injured—it was about half an inch deep throughout the whole length—it was a sort of wound that might have been inflicted by a razor Cross-examined Q It might have been worse than it was if done with a sharper instrument A It was not done with a blunt instrument it was a perfectly clean cut—it appeared as if done in a hurry—it was a single wound David Cook dressing-case maker of Gregory-place Wingrove-place Clerkenwell William Thomas Cook his son and Richard Cox coppersmith St John

clock in the evening of the 2nd of June the prosecutor was brought there—he had a would on the right side of the head which had been bleeding—on putting my finger into it to examine it I found the bone was depressed driven in and pressing on the brain that would require considerable violence—a blow with such an instrument as this poker might cause it—I should say it was inflicted by the head part—it was necessary to remove a portion of the bone and I have it here producing it —the place had healed up in the proper way COURT Q Was it a dangerous wound A It was—he remained in the Hospital ten weeks—it so happened that no dangerous symptoms presented themselves but from the nature of the would they were likely to occur—if he had been of a bad habit of body there would have been danger

clock on the morning in question in the kitchen—he was doing nothing but looking after the breakfast and preparing to go out as usual—I left him there and went out and when I returned between nine and ten in the evening I found him hiding in the kitchen—that was before the blow was struck—I knocked at the door and found he had bolted himself in—he let me in when he found who it was—there had been a great deal of quarrelling and disputing that day—I had been told on the previous evening that the prosecutor was concocting this row and my uncle told me to come in the morning that I might effect

been talking to her for five minutes COURT Q Then the effect of your coming was to bring the prosecutor into the passage and then the prisoner came up with the poker and struck the blow A Well it appears so but in the morning I had asked the prosecutor s sister to allow Byrnes to come out and she did—she took her brother into the parlour and Byrnes came out—that made me return in the evening

question—I went to the doctor s about ten o clock and did not come back to the house until about eight in the evening—I went down into the kitchen for my box and my uncle was lying on the bed—he told

said There is the knife lying in the bed and the other part of the blade I think is in his forehead for I cannot find it —I could not find the other part—there was a good deal of blood in the bed and on the stairs—as I took her to the station she said they had had a quarrel in bed that morning and she told him she was in the family way by him and he replied that if she was it was none of his that he would do nothing for her or the child that she might do what she could for it BENJAMIN WENMAN re-examined There had been no dispute between us about her being with child at any time—there had been

intimacy with her and so caused her to lose her situation—she did not complain to me of that—I had been to her at that situation—she had been in a place before this which she left on the Monday night I kept company with her there—I do not know how she lost that place—I had no conversation with her about it in those three days—she told me she left her last place because instead of coming down to

ear she supposed it would have done for him quickly—I had told her where the wound was—she said she had known him four or five months that he had had connection with her and that after a short time she told him she was in the family way and after that he proved quite different to her and said she must go and find another father for it for he would not—she said he had been out of work five or six weeks and she had supported him a great portion of that time and that night going to the lodging she had only 18d and she paid that for the bed—the next morning they* * * that she had not a farthing in her pocket that he turned round at her with a sort of sneer that she did not know what to do and therefore she inflicted the wound that her intention was to have done for him as he was so unfeeling

Shea came down to me and said Tell your husband to bring up the bill —I said he was not in when be came in I would tell him—she came down twice after that—my husband and the broker came in afterwards—they went up and could not get into the room the door was locked-Mr Shea said he was to bring the bill by-and-by and he would pay it when his wife came in—she was out then—she afterwards came in and went up stairs—she went out twice again and after she went up again I went and knocked at the door—Mr Shea opened it—I said Mr Shea this is the broker s-warrant will you settle this and leave in peace —he said I will pay you —I had gone into the room—Mrs Shea came in at the time and struck me with something I did not see what over the head and knocked me down—she said nothing to me—Mr Shea jumped on my stomach as I was on the floor and threw himself with his knees over my chest and stomach and held me down and she kicked me violently in the lower part of my body I am very lame now—I screamed out Murder and my husband came up to my assistance—I afterwards saw Mrs Shea with a hammer—when my husband came in they got off me and went to him and Mrs Shea knocked him down with a blow of the hammer on the forehead—I got up and said For God s sake Shea do not kill my husband —he said Yes I will and I will do for the pair of you —I threw myself over my husband trying to keep him from the blows and then I turned round—I saw a shoemaker s knife and hammer in each of their hands—she had a large hammer with a large bottom to it and he had a small one—we were beaten with them and cut in two—I was cut in the back of my head—I bled violently and then they got off as we were covered with blood—they got up to shut the door arid I got up as well as I could covered with blood with no cap or anything on—I got to the window screamed out Murder for God s sake come to my assistance for my husband is lying dead on the floor —Mrs Shea ran after me to the window and when she saw the crowds of people she said I will disperse that mob you shall not have any witness putting her hand to some flower-pots that were there and throwing them out—she took me by the legs and tried to throw me out—I held by the window by my two hands and she could not get me out—she took my shoes and stockings from me in trying to get me from the window—she gave me several blows with the

went up with the broker—only Mr Shea was in the room when I went in—we did not make out a bill of the rent we thought there was no occasion—I cannot say what they meant by saying they would pay the rent when we brought up the bill—they often promised money and did not pay it—they were to have paid weekly—they had paid their rent all but eight weeks—the prisoners daughter was not in the room when I went in—I did not see her there that morning—this is the first time I have got into such a quarrel as this—I am bound over to keep the peace through Mrs Shea—she said my daughter who is fourteen years old was in the family-way by her own brother and Mrs Baldwin a shoemaker s wife and me were both bound over to keep the peace through this woman—we did not have a fight—I asked her what made her take my girl s character away—a policeman 274 came up to the door—he was not sent for—she was calling me and my husband swindlers—I did not send for the broker because the prisoners were going to the police-office to get a warrant against me for assaulting the female prisoner—we had given them written notice about twelve o clock on the Saturday—I have been bound over to keep the peace on no other occasion—I was in prison once through some people who came into my place drinking and lost some money—they brought a policeman back and swore they lost it at my place—I was going to strike the policeman and I was sent to prison for that—I cannot say whether it was an indictment for a riot no charge of that kind was ever made ngainst me—I never assaulted a gentleman—the female came in while I was there and found me in the room with her husband—I did not think she was going to strike me she struck me without any provocation—I was standing talking to her husband about settling and leaving in peace when she came in—I showed him the warrant when I first went in—the broker told me I could serve it—I went up to show it to him thinking he would settle it—I could not seize his goods I could not do anything myself—the broker took them afterwards—I did not lay hold of the chairs and say I would seize them—I laid hold of nothing—there were no chairs there but two old ones—I do not think they were broken then they were broken before—they had had the things pretty well carried away—I cannot say whether anything else was broken—there was no table there that I saw for I had too much trouble on my mind when I laid hold of my husband-before my husband came I did not lay hold of the chairs and say I would seize them on the warrant I did not say anything—I did not knock the flower-pots out she did for fear I should have any witnesses—they were outside the window—there was not a good deal of noise before the woman came up—I had only been there three or four minutes-no one was in the room underneath there was a young man in the garret but he did not interfere—I do not know whether he was there at the time—I first saw the hammer in her hand when she struck my husband—after I got up from being knocked down they got off me to go to my husband—when they struck him he said God I am dead —I did not take up parts of the chairs and strike the prisoners nor did my husband—I had not been drinking at all MICHAEL COX I am the husband of the-last witness and am a tailor Some time before Sept the prisoners were lodgers of mine for four or five months—they owed me some rent and five weeks before this happened I told them to go away—they would not leave and I could not get my rent—I employed a broker to distrain after I had given them written notice—the broker s warrant was left with my wife on Monday the 18th—I went out that day leaving my wife at-home—when I came back I heard a noise—went up and found her and the prisoners in their room—I turned about to speak to Shea and the woman struck me with a hammer and knocked me down senseless—I did not see anything done to my wife—I had not time—I was knocked down the moment I went up—it appeared to me that they had been ill-using her—I had no time to see whether she was bleeding or not—I remained senseless till I was taken out of the room—I do not know what became of my wife—the woman struck me with a large shoemaker s hammer—I did not see any other hammer in the room at that time Cross-examined Q When did you give the notice A I gave the legal notice on the Monday morning week—I had given several verbal notices before that—I wanted them to go out—they left word when I was out that they would pay the rent if the bill was sent up—I demanded the rent several times not with the broker—they would not let me in when I went with the broker in the morning the girl asked who was there—I said it was me—the male prisoner said What do you want —I said I understand you want to settle or something of that sort—he said I will be down directly and the broker and I went down—he did not come and the broker sent my wife up to know if he was coming down and he sent back word that he did not want to see me—the broker said it was no use stopping seeing they kept their door shut and he left the warrant with me saying I could serve it and to get into the room stop in the place and send for him—I did not see anything done to my wife—the prisoner s daughter was in the room in the morning—she was not there when I went up—I had been out two hours—I was taken to the hospital the same night and had my wounds sewed up—I had four wounds in my head—they struck me three times after I was knocked down SAMUEL TAAFFE City-policeman 212 Between four and five o clock on Monday afternoon 18th Sept I went to George-passage Snow hill and saw the two witnesses standing at the window looking into the street—their faces were altogether covered with blood—I went up-stairs and could not get into the room—I came down got assistance and the door was broken open—I found Shea standing rather behind his wife with this hammer in his hand producing it —it is rather small apparently a shoemaker s hammer—I seized him took the hammer from him threw it down and got him down stairs and took him to the station—when I got into the room Cox and his wife were standing at the window looking out—they were injured Cross-examined Q What was the appearance of the room A The furniture appeared to be altogether broken and thrown on the floor—it consisted of chairs stools and hammers—it was all thrown on the floor and broken—there was no glass—a crowd of people was in the street—I saw the two Cox s at the window and when I got into the room they were in the same place—the prisoners were close to the bed in a corner—I did not observe anything in the female prisoner s hand—I did not see any blood on the prisoners—I did not examine them—I took the male prisoner because he had a hammer in his hand—he was in his shirt-sleeves—his shirt was torn—he had his trowsers on—I expected he was the person who had struck Cox from the appearance Cox presented—Cox had a wound over his eye and two or three cuts at the back of the head—I cannot say whether they had been drinking—they were very much excited—they made a noise—I did not hear Murder called—I did not hear the prisoners call out BOHLE HARRIS City-policeman 288 On the afternoon of 18th Sept my attention was called to Cox s house—I saw Mr and Mrs Cox at the window of the second-floor room which was open—there was a deal of blood about their beads and their breasts—they were crying out Murder —I saw some garden-pots thrown out of window—a great number of people were below—I do not know who threw the pots out—I went up-stairs succeeded in breaking open the room door went in and the two prisoners were in the room—Shea had this hammer in his hand—it was then smeared with blood—I did not observe the woman do anything—this other hammer produced I received at the station from the sergeant on duty—it was taken there by somebody I do not know who—it was covered with blood—when I got into the room Cox and his wife claimed our protection their heads were cut and bruised in various places—they were covered with blood and there was a deal of blood on the floor it looked like a slaughter-house Cross-examined Q Everything in the room was in a state of great disorder A There were some chairs there which were broken—there was no table THOMAS ELLARD I am a tailor and live at 18 Peter-street Cow-cross On the afternoon of 18th Sept my attention was drawn to George-passage Snow-hill—I saw Cox and his wife at the window covered with blood flowing from their heads—I assisted the policemen in breaking open the room door—I went in and saw Mr and Mrs Cox and the prisoners—the male prisoner was in the act of getting under the bed the female was by the side of it—I observed blood in the middle of the floor on the wall and on tie window-ledge at which I had seen them looking out—I assisted in taking them to the hospital and saw their wounds dressed CHARLES MILES I am house-surgeon at St Bartholomew s Hospital Mrs Cox was brought there first—she had two cuts over the left side of the head and bruises about the body—the cuts appeared to have bled—she continued in the hospital ten days—the cuts were dangerous for a few days—she went out on 28th to go before the Magistrate—she was not then perfectly recovered—she was out of danger—they were lacerated irregular wounds such as this hammer would have been likely to produce Cross-examined Q How many wounds had she on the head A Two on the left side—one was about an inch and a half in length a sort of triangular wound—neither of the wounds exposed the bone—they were both about the same size on the frontal bone and the parietal bone—any wound on the head is liable to be dangerous—these did not turn out so—they were liable to produce erysipelas—a scratch might in some cases do that such cases have occurred—the bruises were all over the ribs and to the right knee—she was insensible when she came and appeared rather stunned—I think that arose from the effect of the blow—she is quite well now—she has a lameness in walking from the bruises—that might have arisen from falling on her knees—there were no marks of kicking on the lower parts of her person—I examined the abdomen—I did not see any appearances there not lower than the ribs—there was soreness COURT Q Had the bleeding ceased when she came in A Yes she was suffering from the effects of the blow—I do not think the bleeding would have a tendency to relieve her from the stunning effects of the blow—it might do so a certain time after the receipt of the blow but not directly George Newland

BEWLET police-sergeant D 20 On 26th Dec I was in Orchard-place Portman-square the prisoner came up to me hawked and made a sort of spit in my face—I had done nothing nor spoken to him—he was a little drunk—I desired him to go away—there was a row lower down—most of the men were engaged there—I turned round to hear what was going on and saw the prisoner coming but I did not at that time see that he had a knife—several police were about but were engaged lower down—the prisoner made several strokes at me—I took out my staff and kept him off several times—he said You b—r I will do for you —I felt a knife prick my thumb and called out that he was stabbing me—assistance came but he plunged the knife into my thigh and cut my coat through in two places and my belt in two places on my side—I had not used my staff or struck him at all—he appeared to know me—I knew him by sight—he made many more blows than made marks on my dress—I kept them off but do not think I struck him more than once—I saw he had a white-handled knife—he had gone into one of the houses in the court close to where it began—my thigh bled furiously—it was running out of my boot before I could get to the doctor s—I am not well yet nor fit to stand—generally for six or seven months when he and others have met me about the same place he has growled as I passed—I do not know what for—I never took notice of it—I never offered him any violence—James Topp Jeapes Hallingan and Saunders were there Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was not the prisoner very much hurt about the head A I do not know—I do not know how he got the hurt on his head that he has now—I believe it was done at the station—I do not know how many men struck him on the head with their staves—I did not drag him out and dash him on the stones that I swear he did not in my hearing cry out Oh my head it is broke —he was secured by the other constables—I did not leave till he was secured—I told the constables to draw their staves because I was stabbed and to be careful—I did not tell them not to forget him—they did not in my presence beat him several times about the head—they caught hold of him and took him into custody—there were four policeman there altogether two were keeping off the mob—I did not bear Hallingan call out Do not hit him he has had enough of hitting —I think I must have heard it if it had been said—this was about half-past nine o clock—he was not very drunk he was drunk—he was not inside the door of his house when I first spoke to him—when he hawked and spit at me I told him he had better go on—he was then about three or four yards from his own house—he made a sort of grunge or altercation and went lower down the court where there were some more men and as I was going out of the court having been sent for to another place where police were wanted I looked round and saw him coming at me with a knife— 83 had previously desired him to go away I did not see him go in doors —of course I protected myself—he struck at me but missed me—I stepped on one side—I took out my staff and kept off several blows till I felt the knife—I might have struck his hand—I did not hit him on the head—what he said to me was I will do for you you b—r not I will give it you The witness s deposition being referred to stated— He said You b—r I will give it you —he may have said that also—I was suffering very much when I was before the Magistrate MR CLARKSON Q Was there a mob of people A A great many I think 200—while the prisoner was striking at me they called out Give it the b—r a great many Irish live in the place—the prisoner is an Irishman—I could not swear to any of the persons in the mob I was so much engaged in protecting myself JAMES TOPP I was in Orchard-place on this evening and saw the prisoner and a lot of other persons in the court—he was making a disturbance—Bewley told him to go on and I also told him—he appeared to have been drinking—I saw him go into 26 where I believe he lives—he came out again in a few seconds with something in his hand and I saw him strike at Bewley several times with something in his hand—I had not seen Bewley offer him any violence—he cried out that he was stabbed or struck —the prisoner then made his way into 26—I followed him into the front parlour and got hold of him—he said he would serve me the same—Halligan came to my assistance and we secured him—we had a hard matter to get him to the station—he was trying to throw himself down and me also—we wanted to search him at the station but he refused—I and another constable had hold of him—he tried to trip me up and to throw himself down several times and at last he fell right on his face on the stones and cut his head—I never drew my truncheon on him—I did not see any one inflict any blow on him—he had nothing the matter with his head when I took him to the station Cross-examined Q Was not he very drunk A He was drunk I have seen men drunker—he was very drunk—he conducted himself like a madman—I cannot say how many men drew their staves I did not see any— I believe some of them did—I heard Bewley say something to the men about drawing their staves—I did not see them hit the prisoner several times with them—two of us had hold of him going to the station and there were two or three more to keep the mob away—two of us had hold of him at the time he cut his head—the doctor did not attend him—he was put into the cell and remained there all night—I believe Halligan is called Big Tom—I did not hear him or anybody say Do not hit him he has had enough hitting —I did not hear the prisoner say Oh my head is broke MR CLARKSON Q What were the mob about as you were taking him to the station A We expected they would take the prisoner away—they hallooed out Take him away take him away give it to them —they followed us to the station—there might be fifty or sixty or more GEORGE JEAPES policeman D 283 About ten o clock on boxing night I was in Orchard-place—there was a crowd of people there and I saw the prisoner among them—I saw a crowd round the door of No 26 and saw Bewley telling the prisoner to go in—he was drunk and swearing and stamping and grinning at Bewley and said he would be b—d if he would go in—he went just on to the sill of the door and was very violent indeed—I saw him make seven or eight blows at Bewley—I could not see whether he had anything in his hand—I was two or three yards off—he was standing with his left arm round the door-post and with his right he was stabbing at Bewley but could not get a reach at him—Bewley did not strike or offer any violence to him—after he was struck at several times he called out I am stabbed he has got a knife draw your staves —I drew my staff—the prisoner still stood there stabbing—he would have stabbed me if I had not kept myself back—his room is the parlour on the right-hand side of the passage—while I was drawing my staff Topp rushed into the room and took him into custody—he was partly in and partly out of the room at the time-there were several women in the room trying to pull him in but he would not go—he was very drunk and violent—he was taken to the station which was about a quarter of a mile off—a great mob followed us—there were four or five policemen—I was behind Topp keeping the crowd back with my staff—the mob called out Go steady go steady —I did not strike the prisoner and I did not see anybody else do so—I should have struck him when I had got my staff out if Topp had not rushed by me—it was unsafe to approach him without disarming him—it was dark in the passage—he got the blow over the head by falling down on the stones in the station—he was very violent and would not be searched—the injury is not the result of any blow struck by the police—he threw himself down—I found this knife on him with three blades produced —Orchard-place is a low noisy place Cross-examined Q How many police were there A Four—the first thing I saw was the prisoner standing on the sill stamping and grinning—Bewley told him to go in—he said Go in and mind your own business —he said it very mildly—he did not say Go in sir go in and don t be standing here —it was after Bewley was stabbed that I saw the prisoner strike at him seven or eight times MR CLARKSON Q If Bewley had offered any act of violence towards the prisoner were you near enough to have seen it A Certainly THOMAS HALLIGAN policeman D 83 I was in Orchard-place and saw the prisoner among other people—he was drunk and bellowing out—I heard Bewley tell him to go in doors and I told him to go in—that was after I had observed he was drunk and violent—I afterwards heard Bewley cry out that he was stabbed and that the prisoner had a knife—I believe he directed us to draw our staves—in the scuffle the prisoner struck Bewley several times before I came to his assistance—I did not go till he said he was stabbed— At this period of the trial one of the Jurors was suddenly taken ill and it appearing by the testimony of two medical gentlemen who were requested to attend him that he was not likely to be able to resume his duties the Court discharged the remaining Jurors from giving a verdict One of the Jurors in waiting was substituted and the remaining eleven re-sworn and the evidence already given was read over to them by Mr Recorder —I helped to secure him—he had no wound on the head then he received that at the station Cross-examined Q When they were about to strike him did you say No do not hit him he has had enough hitting A No nothing of the sort—I am sometimes called Big Tom —I told the prisoner to go in several times—he knew what he was doing he was not so very drunk—he was able to walk and to strike a blow—he was very violent at the station-house and would not be searched—I might have said on the way to the station-house Do not hit the man because I had him properly secured—there were two constables behind endeavouring to keep the crowd away MR CLARKSON Q Did anybody strike the prisoner A No WILLIAM BEWLEV re-examined A statement was made by the prisoner before the Magistrate which was taken down and signed—this is Mr Broughton s signature— read— The prisoner says I never struck the sergeant about six months ago he struck me and followed me into the passage with his staff and gave me a stroke with it I committed no offence on that man that I recollect HENRY SAUNDERS policeman D 221 I was in Orchard-place on this night and heard Bewley call out that he had been stabbed GEORGE WILSON I am a surgeon and assist Mr Vickers 32 Baker-street On the morning of 27th Dec I saw Bewley—I examined his thigh and found that he had received a stab in the upper part of it corresponding with two cuts in his coat and trowsers—the wound was nearly an inch and a half deep and half an inch in width—it was exactly such a wound as would be the result of a puncture by a small knife—it was not bleeding then—his drawers were covered with blood and they had also been cut—I have been in attendance on him ever since and he is not yet well—he is not fit to be in Court now—it will be some time before he will be able to resume his duties—it is a very awkward wound indeed and independent of that he received several other blows in the scuffle COURT Q Was it a wound that might have proved dangerous A Where it was it could not have proved dangerous unless erysipelas had followed but if it had been three inches higher it would have transfixed the femoral artery that would have materially perilled his life—if he had not had immediate assistance he would have bled to death Cross-examined Q As it was you did not look at it as a serious wound A It was not one that would endanger his life—I did not attend the prisoner GUILTY Aged 48 — Transported for Ten Years

conducted the Prosecution EDWARD ELGAR City policeman 85 On Wednesday morning 24th Jan about a quarter-past two o clock I was on duty near the White Horse Fann-street Goswell-street and saw a crowd in front of the bar there—the prisoner was among them—he and a woman with whom he cohabits were quarrelling with Bresnahan who is known among his companions by the name of Browney—I called out to the landlady and said I must have the house cleared immediately—I took hold of the prisoner first and put him out and the woman afterwards—I then took hold of Bresnahan and while I had hold of him Glynn came in again—I seized him by the collar and threw him out of the house with considerable force so that he almost fell down—it is a narrow court and he fell up against a wall—when be stood upright again I observed that he had his right hand in his trowsers pocket—my attention was occupied for the moment in getting others out of the house and on looking round I saw Glynn and Bresnahan fighting—Glynn kept his left hand in front of him striking only with his right hand very wide and swinging blows—I immediately rushed between forced them apart and immediately saw blood gushing out of Bresnahan s face and neck and he cried out My God he has been and knifed me —I then seized the prisoner by the collar and looked at both his hands but found no knife—Bresnahan bled a good deal—the blood flew all across the passage on to the shutters of the public-house—he was taken to Mr Child s the surgeon THOMAS BRESNAHAN I am a labourer and live at 22 Field-lane Holborn On Tuesday night the 23d I was at the White Horse Fann-street and saw the prisoner there in front of the bar—about twelve o clock I told him not to interfere with any words that were going on in front of the bar any more than myself—there were words with other people—I asked for another pint of porter and they would not serve me—the police-sergeant came in—I walked out and the prisoner turned out after me—he stood in an attitude to fight me with both his hands up and before I had time to ask what he meant by it he struck me a blow with his right hand—his left hand was down—Elgar rushed in between us—I was going to return the blow and be cut me a second time with the same hand—I did not feel that I was subbed—I thought the people had chucked some hot water on me out of the window till I saw both my hands smoking with blood—I then turned round and said By God he has struck me with a knife —I was taken to the station and Mr Childs examined me—there was a wound across my throat which bled very much—it soaked through a thick handkerchief COURT Q Had you had no quarrel with the prisoner that evening A No nor with any other persons there—I had not said a word to him except what I have said—I had not seen him since the night before—we met first that evening about twelve o clock up-stairs and directly he came I went down stairs to the front of the bar and he afterwards followed me down—the woman who lives with the prisoner called me a bad name just as I was going out of the door and I said If I was close to you I would give you a smack of the cheek and with that the prisoner followed me out Prisoner Q Did I speak to you up-stairs 1 A No you came down alone you did not say a word for half an hour alter you came down—I spoke to you first and told you not to interfere—you wanted to take part with the landlady of the house where you live for fear she should not trust you with another night s lodging—I did not say if you interfered I would pay you for it—I did not ask you to come out and fight and have the fight out we had had a fortnight before—you did not tell me that you could not fight on account of your arm being so bad and I did not say if you did not fight I would punch your head—a young woman there did not say Tom do not be so hard upon him he can t fight now —I did not run after her to hit bet—I walked quietly to the step of the door and she called me a fig s get—that was on account of the row that happened between us a fortnight before—I never spoke to her before this night—I did not pass up and down Field-lane with her—I did not tell her I would punch your head for interfering—you did not tell me if I waited till your arm was better you would have it out COURT Q Was his arm bad at all A Not that I know of—we had a fight a fortnight before GEORGE BANKS City-policeman 153 About two o clock in the morning of 24th I found this penknife produced on the pavement near the White Horse—it had blood on the blade—it was shut—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor fighting outside the door—it was neár that spot that I found it—I heard Bresnahan call out He has knifed me GEORGE BORLASE CHILDS I am a Fellow of the College of Surgeons and am surgeon to the City-police Force On Wednesday morning 24th Jan about half-past two o clock Bresnahan was brought to me—he was very faint from loss of blood—he had received a punctured wound on the left cheek—a small artery had been divided—I also found a wound sweeping along the left side of the neck extending from just behind the ear to the front part of the neck—it passed over the jugular vein the carotid artery and the principal nerves leading from the brain to the trunk—it was such a wound as might have been produced by this knife—the man s life was only saved by the dulness of the weapon—the wound on the cheek was a vertical wound about an inch in extent and reached to the bone—such an instrument as this might have produced both wounds—he must have lost a good deal of blood—he is still under the care of Mr M Murdo at the Compter Pritoner s Defence written The prosecutor challenged me to fight I told him I could not in consequence of my arm but if he would wait till it was well I would he

pistol after he fired it—he took it out of his pocket then fired it at Tyler and as he was running put it into his pocket again it was about ten o clock—the neighbourhood is not very well lighted—I have said I thought the prisoner did it out of a lark—I think so still it was all in perfect good-humour—I had never seen him with a pistol before JOHN SUMNER I live at 2 Angel Alley On 17th Jan about seven o clock I saw Tyler the prisoner and Graves together—I had not passed them above three yards before Tyler called me—she came to me and we were talking together ten minutes or a quarter of an hour and while we were talking the prisoner went away—we remained two or three minutes and then Tyler and Graves walked down and I went after them towards Skinner-place—the prisoner was sitting on a post there—I saw Tyler take off his cap he was going to walk away without it when she ran after him and gave it him back again—Tyler and Graves then went towards their own door and I went to my own house and after that I went out and came home about ten and just before I got to the door I heard the report of a pistol or some sort of fire-arms—I heard the screams of a female—I went up immediately and found Tyler in Graves arms—there was blood running but I do not know where the wound was—I took her to the doctor s and then in a cab to the hospital Cross-examined Q Have you known the prisoner some time A Yes he generally appeared in delicate health he never appeared to be in very good health ROBERT MASON I am house-surgeon at St Bartholomew s Hospital On Wednesday evening 17th Jan about half-past ten or eleven o clock Tyler was brought there—I examined her head and found a gun-shot wound on the left-side and about two inches further on there was another wound about the same size—there was not much blood she was very faint the blood being stopped—the wounds from their shape and size were evidently caused by a bullet—the bullet appeared to have entered at the lower wound and made its exit at the upper one traversing about two inches under the skin it had gone close to the bone which was bared but not fractured—the side of her face near the wound was scorched and blackened by the gun-powder—I probed the wound but found no bullet—I put her Under the charge of Mrs Osborne the nurse and she has been in the hospital ever since that has been necessary in consequence of the state of her health her nerves have been very much shaken—the wound of—Itself was not dangerous but it might have been so in its consequences if inflammation or erysipelas had arisen Cross-examined Q On which side was the wound A The left—it did not present any dangerous features—she was taken to the Mansion House in a cab and was just able to give her evidence—it was a large bullet wound—I cannot say from the fact of the bullet being found in her hair whether it was a heavy charge or not the hair was very thick behind—I have not sufficient knowledge of the force of a bullet to say whether if it had been a heavy charge it would have passed through the hair—it most have been very forcible for it went through the scalp in one direction and out at another and then lodged in the hair SUSANNAH OSBORNE I am a nurse at St Bartholomew s Hospital On Wednesday night 17th Jan Tyler was put under my charge—next day I dressed her head and found in her hair above the top wound this piece of lead or copper like a bullet produced —it was so much discoloured with the blood that I could not tell what it was—I gave it to Mr Mason MR MASON re-examined This is the bullet I received from Mrs Osborne GODFREY FOSBERY City police-inspector I heard of this matter on Wednesday night about twenty minutes past eleven o clock About seven next morning I found the prisoner at his father s house—I took him into custody and told him what it was for—he said there was nothing in the pistol but paper—I took him to the station and on the way he said that Tyler wished him to buy another pistol to shoot her and afterwards himself—I asked him whit he did with the pistol and he said he threw it away into the ruins which is a vacant piece of ground near his house where there is rubbish—I received this bullet from Mr Mason and this wadding almost as hard as a bullet was found in the cap attached to Tyler s bonnet AMOS MERRITT City-policeman 73 I searched in these ruins on 18th Jan for the pistol—I made two minute searches but did not find any pistol—I took the prisoner from the Mansion House to the Compter after his first examination—going up Cheapside he said it was a bad job and asked me how the girl was I told him I understood she was very ill indeed in the hospital—he said on several occasions he had seen John Sumner and her larking together and he did so on the previous evening and on several other nights and he felt very much annoyed at it he saw them standing together that night for about ten minutes or so and he then left them and went away and soon after he met her again in the alley and she said she wanted none of his black looks for she did not mean to keep company with him any longer but to go along with John Sumner he afterwards met her in the alley along with Graves and she asked him to go with her to London bridge and asked Graves to go and get her bonnet and shawl and go with them to throw themselves all three over London-bridge which he refused to do she then went in to get her bonnet and shawl for that purpose they then stood together for a few minutes and he pulled the pistol out of his pocket but he did it merely to frighten her he did not mean to shoot her—he said he threw the pistol into the ruins Cross-examined Q Was he in a very weak state at the time A Yes—he is generally in a weak state—I do not know that he was weaker than usual he was able to walk—I knew him before—I never knew anything against him—I understand he has been very ill since he has been in gaol—the last time I took him from the Mansion House I was obliged to take him in a cab MR WOOLLETT to EMMA TYLER Q I think you say you have known the prisoner about six months A Yes—we have not been a great deal together sometimes we have—we have often played together and Graves also—I have seen him with a pistol—I did not know he carried it in his pocket—I cannot tell how long he has had it I believe some time—I have seen him fire it—he has held it before me—he is generally in a very weak state of health—we have always been on friendly terms—I did not suppose he was going to murder me I had no idea of it—I do not suppose he had any malice towards me—he had snapped it at me before on several occasions—it was not loaded then—it had a cap on it—that was in fun JURY Q Had you seen the pistol that evening previous to this occurring A No

thirteen weeks—I have been supporting him all that time by going out to work at laundry work On Saturday night 28th April I came home about 9 o clock and went to bed about ten—I have two children one is five years old and the other two and a half—they slept by themselves in the same room—my husband had not come home when I went to bed—I fell asleep and was awoke about twenty minutes to twelve by my husband leaning over me with a knife in the act of stabbing me—it was a white handled dinner-knife very pointed at the edge—he stabbed me once after I awoke on the left shoulder—I was lying on my right side—I said to him For God s sake Rivers what are you doing —he made no answer he was drunk—I received twelve different stabs on the left breast the right breast and the shoulder—I did not awake till he gave me the last stab—I sleep very sound—I jumped out of bed—he dropped the knife on the pillow—I found that my night-linen was very bloody—I caught hold of him and begged him to sit down he would not—he asked me for a penny—I gave it him and he said he would go and have half a pint of beer—he went out and I then took the children up-stairs and left them in the care of a lodger fearing as he was drunk he would do more mischief—I bled a great deal—I was taken to the doctor s and there fainted—I cannot say whether my husband was very tipsy he was tipsy—I could not see whether he staggered about the room when I got up—he has been very unkind to me ever since he has been in prison last—that was for stealing a pair of boots—there was no one in the room when this happened but the children—I have been under the doctor s care ever since—this is the knife it was done with produced —it was bent as it is now when I found it Prisoner Q Did not I ask you afterwards to tell me all about what I had done A No—you never spoke till your master asked if I was going to speak to you—I went into the passage to you and said If you don t believe what you have done you can prove it now —you turned your back and never spoke but went out with your master—you said you thought a man was after you for breaking a window and you would go away for a week or so MR CLARKSON Q You did not wish to press the charge against him I believe but your brother wished you to A No—I did not—I was afraid to do so because I thought I should be in more danger GEORGE BURTON PAYNE I am a surgeon and have a place of business at Grey Coat-place Westminster On Saturday night 28th April shortly after twelve o clock Sarah Rivers was brought to me—she was insensible and in a fainting condition—her dress was saturated with blood and she was bleeding from several wounds—there was one very large wound about five inches long and more than two inches deep on the upper part of the shoulder the bone was exposed—whatever she had been struck with must have struck against the bone—there were ten or a dozen wounds round the same arm and in the ribs and side of the body—they were not very severe wounds—such a knife as this produced would have caused such wounds I should attribute the bending to its striking against the bone—it was not a wound that would affect life—there was also a slight wound or rather scratch across the right breast MARY HAWKINS I lived at Smith s-rents in York-street Westminster and had been with Mrs Rivers as servant since last November On this Saturday night between six and seven o clock I saw the prisoner go to the cupboard take a sharpening stone out which was kept there and sharpened this knife—I said Mr Rivers what are you sharpening that knife for —he said he might want it by and by for something RICHARD COUSENS policeman B 30 On this Saturday night a little after twelve o clock I was called by a lodger in the house—went and found the prisoner standing at the door—he was the worse for liquor the woman declined giving him into custody but asked me to stay to take care of her—I stayed about half an hour or rather better—some vulgar language passed—he was taken away by a man to have half a pint of beer—returned in about a quarter of an hour and wanted to know what all we b—s were lurking about there for—he then passed me went to the door and said the first b—that came to the door he would show them cold steel and took out this other knife produced —I did not take him into custody that night but I did afterwards on a warrant—he then said he was sorry for what he had done—I afterwards went to the cupboard in the room and found there this stone—the floor of the room was very bloody—I received this bent knife from the prosecutrix

t18490611-1358  1358 MARK JEFFERY feloniously wouading Joseph Robert Allen on the head with intent to do him grievous bodily harm —2d COUNT with intent to maim and disable him MESSRS BODKIN AND CLERK conducted the Prosecution JOSEPH ROBERT ALLEN I am chief warden of the Warrior convict hulk at Woolwich In May last I was second mate—the prisoner was a convict on board and had been so from 2d of Jan under sentence for fifteen years—the convicts are sent from the hulk to work in the Dockyard in gangs—on 15th May the prisoner was sent ashore with others to work in a gang—at twelve o clock he returned to dinner—after dinner he was ordered back with his gang—he attempted to go into another gang as he expected they would get a small portion of beer—I requested him to fall back into his own gang that he had been with in the morning and he was marched off with them—about an hour after he was brought back to the hulk in custody of a sentinel for refusing to work in the yard—Mr Masterman the overseer of the hulk was sent for—the prisoner stated to him that he had not sufficient food to enable him to perform his work—the overseer told him that he had the quantity allowed by Government which was considered sufficient—he was then ordered to return to his work but refused to go—the overseer ordered that if he did not return to his work he was to be locked up—I was standing about four yards from him—I turned from the prisoner to look over the gangway when I received a tremendous blow on the back of the head—I did not see him strike it—it completely stunned me for a minute or two—as soon as I was sufficiently recovered on looking round I saw the prisoner aiming a blow with this weapon a round piece of wood at the overseer s head—my own head was bleeding—I saved myself from falling by resting my hand on the gangway—we had no such weapon as this on board—it is a trenail and is used in the Dockyard it is very heavy wood—I was taken to Mr Dabbs the surgeon kept my bed for two days and was confined to my lodging for a fortnight Prisoner You did not save yourself from falling you went straight away into Mr Masterman s room there was no blood spilt on the quarter-deck Witness I saved myself from falling as I have described—I did not see anything in the prisoner s hand before I saw him striking at the overseer HENRY THOMAS MASTERMAN I am overseer of the Warrior hulk The prisoner was under my care and superintendence—he has frequently complained of the insufficiency of food—he had the full allowance equal to his fellow-prisoners—he appeared to me to be in health and strong but always discontented—on the day in question I was called to the quarter-deck and found him in custody of the sentry—after some inquiry I desired that if he did not go to his work he should be locked up—as soon as I said that he drew from under his jacket or clothes this trenail and struck Mr Allen with it at the side of the head and inflicted a severe scalp-wound—Allen was standing at the side of him—the wound bled—he staggered and saved himself against the bulk-head—the prisoner next aimed a blow at my head with the same weapon but I warded it off with my left arm upon which I received a very severe blow which disabled roe nearly a week—the prisoner said nothing it the time but just afterwards he said I will clear the kitchen for you —he still had the trenail in his hand—Allen then ordered the sentinel to charge him with his bayonet which he did and he was disarmed—he afterwards said I hope I have killed Mr Allen that is the way I should like to serve four or five others —I then had him cross-ironed and locked up—these trenails are to be found in many parts of the Dockyard—the prisoner would have an opportunity in his work of getting one of them Prisoner I did not say I would serve four or five others in the same way I said it served him right what I had done for him GEORGE KEMP I am a private in the marines On 15th May I was sentry in the Dockyard at Woolwich—the prisoner was given into my custody for refusing to work—I took him on board the hulk—he did not pick up anything in the Dockyard in my sight—I did not see him strike Mr Allen—I saw him strike at Mr Masterman who warded off the blow with his left arm—I was ordered to charge him with my bayonet which I did and he gave me the weapon—afterwards as he came up from below he said if the sentry had not been there he would have cleared something but I forget now what the expression was GEORGE HENRY DABBS I am surgeon to the Warrior hulk I saw Allen about three o clock in the afternoon in question on board the hospital ship Unity—I found a wound of about an inch and a half long on the left side of the occipital bone it was an incised wound surrounded by very considerable bruises—it might have been inflicted with an instrument like this—I think it must have struck with the edge the scalp was divided—I continued to attend him till 4th June when he returned to duty—it is no part of my duty to see to the diet of the convicts but in the morning before they go to labour it is my duty to examine the complaining sick—those who are unfit for labour remain on board and those who are sick go to the hospital—I had examined the prisoner on that day he was quite fit for duty—he complained of debility—I asked him if he had any disease—he said he had not but he was weak and unfit for labour—I looked at his arms and found him muscular and robust and his manner displayed considerable energy—I thought him in all respects fit for labour—I have nothing to do with their ordinary diet but when they are sick I have the sole control over them Prisoner He said 1 was able to work and ordered me to stop in and get weighed I did so and I had lost four pounds in a fortnight and three pounds before that besides a stone and a half in Millbank I did not get sufficient food to support my human nature he is no more fit to be a doctor than I am to be a King I have a bad leg now and he did nothing to it it got worse and worse Witness He complained of a bad leg when he was in the cell after this occurrence—he might have complained before but if he did there was not sufficient reason for him to stop in—we are pestered every day with a number of persons who complain in order to avoid labour and we are obliged to draw a line—the men are generally speaking exceedingly robust and muscular and able to work—if I had found any reason to suspect that the diet was insufficient it would have become part of my duty to make that representtion but there was no reason for interference The prisoner in a long defence stated that his diet had been bad and insufficient for a long time past and that all his complaints on the subject were disregarded that on the morning in question he

wife I have been married to him ten or eleven years I have four children On the Thursday that this happened I do not know the day of the month I had been to a public-house with an acquaintance about twelve o clock at night—I did not stop there long—I went home at half-past twelve—my husband was home before me—I had been away about half an hour—I went up to the third floor—before I got in the room I heard a rush and heard my husband come up-stairs—when I heard him I went into a room—I did not shut the door for he was just in after me—he struck me with his hand and I fell over a lot of saucepans and he made a kick at me when I was down—he kicked me in the lower part of my body—the appearances which the surgeon noticed were produced by his violence—I soon got well—I got up and sat on the landing—my husband went to bed—I heard no more noise—I came down in about an hour and sat at the door till two o clock in the morning—the policeman came by and spoke to me—I had received a blow on the head from the prisoner outside the public-house—that was before I went home—he came and called me out of the public-house and spoke to me I was very saucy to him and would go in again and he struck me—after the blow I went to the public-house and told Miss Langton he had struck me and knocked me down and while I was down kicked me on the side of the thigh—I then went home—I did not like to go into the bedroom—I went upstairs and then I heard the rush—I went to the back-room which belongs to a person named Turner to get out of the prisoner s way when I heard him coming—I was in the lodger s room when I received the kicks which I have mentioned—I was lying on my side at the time—my husband was gone to bed before that—we live on the first-floor Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q In point of fact your husband was drunk A He was very tipsy—he came home and found I was at the public-house—I had had a little to drink EMILY LANGTON Mrs Butler came to my house and we went to the public-house together a little before twelve o clock—it was on a Friday—I cannot tell the day of the month—she had been in the public-house about a quarter of an hour when she was called out—I did not see her husband at the public-house nor see him do anything to her—she returned to the door of the public-house—she did not come in—she complained of being hurt—I then went over to the prisoner who was standing outside the gateway and asked him if he was angry with Mrs Butler—he said he would let her know he said he would drown her he would hold her head in the jerry till she was stifled—Mrs Butler left me to go to her own house—I did not see any more of her that night Cross-examined Q Did Mrs Butler live in the same house with you A She used—there were two other women at the public-house beside her and me—they were single women GEORGE FERRIS police-sergeant D 28 On Thursday morning July 19th about half-past two o clock I saw the prosecutrix sitting on the kerb in the Mews opposite her own door—I asked her what was the matter—she said she had been beaten and kicked by her husband—she was not able to get up and appeared to be in great pain—I got assistance and took her to Mr Howlett the surgeon—he attended to her and ordered her to be sent home—when I cook her she took my hand and put it down to the lower part of her person and there appeared to be a lump larger than my double fist—I took the prisoner into custody—he said it was the b—y drink that caused it that he had kicked her and he supposed he had kicked her too low lower than he had intended—the woman was perfectly sober HENRY HOWLETT I am a surgeon of 18 Cambridge-terrace Hyde-park—the officer brought Mrs Butler to my house between two and three o clock that morning—my house is about 100 or 150 yards from where she lives—I put her on the floor of my consulting-room and made a careful examination of her person—I discovered a bruise on the side of her face and some extravasated blood—I examined her leg and found the stocking had been cut through by blows in three or four places—the skin of the leg was broken and it had the appearance of fine nails or it might be gravel in it—that could have been done by kicks—I then made an examination of her private parts—I found there a most frightful contusion of the parts—they were enormously swollen with extravasated blood—there was a swelling of the extent of eight inches running from the pelvis beginning in front and forming an arch underneath between her legs—I ordered her to be carried home by the constables—she was put to bed—I staid with her some hours gave her what was necessary and attended her—the next morning I found the parts were still more inflamed and I was obliged to puncture it as I was afraid it would burst and mortify—her life was in the greatest danger for several days—the parts about the labia were enormously swollen larger than my arm—I should have hardly thought that it would have borne so large an extension as there was—she was a healthy and a strong woman but I considered her life was in danger for five or six days—the effect of the puncture was an oozing of fluid from the part and she suffered from collapse of the womb—she appeared to have an involuntary effusion of urine which I attributed to an injury of the bladder but it was not material—her head was considerably discoloured and one eye was swollen—her thighs were slightly discoloured—I should think she had had one or two distinct blows both before and behind—the shoe must have passed between the thighs and had it not been for the clothes she must inevitably have been killed—I heard she bad been sick on the stairs but I did not see that ROBERT SOWTER policeman D 212 I took the prisoner about half-past two o clock the same night GUILTY Aged 32 —

apprehension and detainer of William Steers MESSRS BODKIN and CLERK conducted the Prosecution AMELIA WARD I live at 5 Francis-street Old-street-road I am a prostitute the same as Elizabeth Steers the prisoners live in the house opposite mine On Sunday 10th March William Steers came to my door between four and five o clock in the morning—he knocked at the door two or three times—I did not let him in—I shut him out once or twice—at last he shoved the door open and came in—another man followed him in and the female prisoner—they came in one after the other—William Steers went to the washhand-stand and broke the basin—he then went to the mantel-piece and dragged a picture down—he then hit a friend of mine William Risley who was there and when he had done beating him he came and beat me—I am not aware that he had anything in his hand then but after he had beat me as long as he could stand over me he took up this quart jug produced and broke it over my head—my head bled and the blood is on the jug now—as soon as I could get from him I ran into the street and called the police—I said For God s sake help me or else I shall be murdered —the policeman happened to be just passing the door—as soon as he came up I lost my senses—I do not recollect what passed—when I ran out into the street I do not know what became of the prisoner—I leaned against the wall—there was nothing done to me in the street that I know of—when I recovered I found myself leaning against the wall—I do not think the policeman came into my house—when I crossed to the prisoner s place to give them in charge the female prisoner pulled my hair just where my head was wounded—they were both tipsy Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q When you recovered you went over to the prisoners house A Yes to give them in charge—the door was open—the basin that William Steers broke was my own it was not one that Risley had brought from the prisoner s house—the female prisoner brought it over the day before—Risley did not say it was his—of course what is in my place belongs to myself—I will swear that Risley did not say the basin was his—the jug has been in my possession ever since—Risley is not here to-day he was before the Magistrate but was not examined—I do not know what Risley was doing while William Steers was beating me—I did not see him strike William Steers—I did not see any mark or blow that Risley gave him—I was not attended by any surgeon—washing my head with warm water cured it—Risley does not live in my house he comes there backwards and forwards—he was sitting there with the door shut for three or four hours before William Steers came—he bad not come in from the prisoner s house a few minutes before WILLIAM ALSWORTH policeman N 71 On Sunday 10th March I was on duty in Francis-street—I saw Ward standing leaning against a wall—the blood was running from a wound in her head down her face and clothes—she appeared to be in a very bad state—she said For God s sake policeman come here I shall be murdered —she said that Steers and his wife had come and burst her door open and had beaten her a man who was in the house and another female with the poker and tongs about the head and likewise with a jug—I did not see the prisoners at that time they were in their own house and the door fastened—I did not see them go in—in consequence of what Ward said I went and knocked at the prisoner s door—one of them made answer Who is there —I said The police —a man s voice said There you are like to be —I asked them a second time to open the door—he refused and I then forced the door open—I was in my uniform as a policeman—I went into the house—I saw both the prisoners—I told them I wanted them—they asked me what for—I told them the charge and William Steers said if I did not go out be would serve me as he bad the rest of them—he refused to come out—I then took him by the collar and dragged him out—I then sprang my rattle and got the assistance of another constable Burns—I wanted him to go into the house and apprehend the other but he said he would sooner take the one I had—I then gave him William Steers in custody—I then went into the house but I returned and saw Burns on the pavement and William Steers was on the top of him with his left foot just above his stomach—William Steers had this leg of a chair in his right hand and he was making a blow at Burns as I came to him—I did not see him strike him—he said I will stamp your b—y guts out —I took hold of him by the collar and dragged him to the station with a great deal of trouble—Burns could scarcely stand when he got up—he could not assist me in any way whatever—Elizabeth Steers was there she had the officer by the collar or the arm I could not see properly which so as to encumber him—I had gone into their house the second time after another man who was there Cross-examined Q On your oath did you never see Burns attempt to strike a blow A Yes on the man not on the woman—when he was lying on the ground he was trying to do as well as he could—I did not see William Steers receive any blow—I saw that he had received blows about the head—there was blood coming from his head it was running down his clothes and shirt when I had him by the collar—when Ward said something about murder the prisoners were in their own house—I forced the door open—it did not want breaking it was a little spring lock I gave it a shove with my arm and shoulder—I did not put my foot against it—I forced it open in the best manner I could—I will not swear that I did not put my foot against it—I went into the house and seized William Steers—I grasped him by the neck-handkerchief—he had no jacket on—I dragged him into the street in the best way I could or I should have got what I was promised if it had not been for a little help—he said if I did not get out he would serve me as he had done the others—Elizabeth Steers was coming to the assistance of her husband when some persons in the house prevented her from touching me—I might have dragged William Steers a couple or three yards from the door when Burns came up—I dare say it was more than five minutes before Burns came up—he took William Steers and I went to go into the house—I wanted to get Elizabeth Steers and another man who was there—they were all three given into my custody—I did not lay a hand on Elizabeth Steers—I do not know that William Steers was attended by a medical man in the House of Detention—I know he had a wound in his head—I afterwards picked up this leg of the chair in the street just by where Burns had lain—on my oath I did not go into a house next door to the prisoner s and get it the next day—I picked it up as soon as I got back from the station in about half an hour—Burns had his truncheon in his hand—I have stated before that William Steers said he would stamp Burn s guts out—I stated it to the other constable and I stated it before the Magistrate MR CLERK Q At the time you took William Steers from his house had be the leg of the chair in his hand A He bad not at that time I believe he picked it up out of the street—he had it in his hand however—I observed that he had blood about him but I did not see that his head was bleeding till I got to the station RICHARD BURNS policeman G 204 On Sunday 10th March my attention was called by the springing of a rattle in Francis-street Old-street-road—I found Alsworth with William Steers in his custody—he gave him into my charge and went away to the house in quest of the other man—after he was gone William Steers put his leg round mine and threw me to the ground—when I was on the ground he commenced kicking me and beating me with the stick while Elizabeth Steers held me down by the hair of my head—I cannot say whether William Steers had this stick in his hand when I took charge of him—he hit me on the back and on the back of the head—I cannot say whether he hit me on the back of my head with the stick or kicked me there—he kicked me two or three times—while I was down Elizabeth Steers held me on the ground by the hair of my head and with her hand on ray forehead also—she did not do anything else to me—at the time she was holding me down by the hair of my head William Steers was kneeling on me and he stamped once or twice on my stomach—I received a wound just by the loins—I cannot say how that was done—I have not been able to go on duty since Cross-examined Q As soon as William steers was left in your custody there was a struggle A Yes he wanted to get away—he swung his leg round mine and threw me to the ground—I struck him once or twice over the wrists—I did not strike him on the head at all—I struck him with my truncheon while I was standing up COURT Q Had you struck him before he attempted to throw you down A Yes before he succeeded in throwing me down—I struck him because he had got hold of my hair and was struggling to get a way—I received a blow on the back of my head but I cannot say with what—I was on the ground when the other officer came to my assistance JOHN BUBBERS MATHER I am a surgeon On Monday 11th March I examined Burns—I found him very much injured about the head and neck and loins—the nape of his neck was very much contused and inflamed—he was suffering very severely—on the right side of his loins there was a wound as if made with some blunt instrument—the neighbourhood of the loins was very much swollen and inflamed—the blows on the head and neck produced contusion of the brain with epileptic fits—he is still under my care and even now I have thought it necessary to have another man with him to watch him Cross-examined Q The principal blow was at the back of his neck A One of them was the injury to the brain was from the blows on the head and neck—they would unquestionably produce the effects I have described COURT Q Was there any wound you would call a cut A The wound on the loins was not cut as an incised wound but as with the toe of the boot—the skin was rolled up and the flesh was raw under it—it might have been by a kick or a blow or a thrust from this instrument—it could not have been by a fall in that position WILLIAM STEERS— GUILTY Aged 27 —

light was quenched—the blow was a good hard blow and with the edge of the hatchet—she called Murder and then he struck her again—she recovered herself in five or six minutes—the door was not broken open—no one touched it but just to knock at it—there was a black man there nearly all day—I did not see him mixing in the fight or touch any one—I did not see the prisoner s little boy—I said nothing about the bolster—I did not see Mrs Neal at all ELLIN SUMMERS I am the wife of Joseph Summers and live in Mrs Hefferman s house I heard cries of Murder went up five or six stairs and saw the prisoner fetch out a hatchet and hit Ann with it on the forehead—she stumbled and he was making another blow—I said Don t you hit her again or you will kill her —I put out my arm to save her and received the blow on it—it cut me here in two places—I ran down as quickly as I could Cross-examined Q Is this your first appearance in a court of justice A Yes I have been in Westminster prison for a row three times—I have never been in Coldbath-fields—I do not know Harrison the officer of the Mendicity Society I have heard of him—he has never been up against me or my husband that I know of—I was never charged with committing an offence in St James s-park or with passing base coin—no one went up-stairs with the prosecutrix to my knowledge—I was in the kitchen and went up when I heard Murder called—Mrs Hefferman was up in the second-floor halloing Murder from the front window—I did not see Mrs M Carthy at the prisoner s door—I did not knock at the prisoner s door—I saw him take the hatchet by the handle and strike her on the forehead—I heard no bad language—she had not left the kitchen five minutes before I followed her up—I have never said I would get as much money out of this case as I did out of the last JOHN HUDSON policeman B 80 On Saturday night about a quarter-past ten o clock I heard a cry of Murder —I found the prosecutrix bleeding profusely from a wound in the corner of the forehead—her clothes were in a complete mass of blood—I found the prisoner s door closed and pushed it in—the prisoner stood with this chopper in his hand inside the door—I told him to mind what he was about and requested him several times to lay it down—I was in my police clothes—I asked him the reason he did it—he said he would slaughter all the b—y lot of then or any person who would insult his wife—I took him to the station with the chopper—he was not the worse for drink—he might have had a pint of beer—I took the prosecutrix to the hospital—she gave her evidence on the Wednesday the other witnesses having given theirs on the Monday Cross-examined Q Where were the prisoner s wife and family A Standing inside the door—the prisoner was not sitting down by the fire—I did not ask him to show me the chopper he had it in his hand WILLIAM DEWSLAP I am house-surgeon to the Westminster Hospital The prosecutrix was brought there with a scalp-wound on the left side of the forehead—it was very deep—it was not bleeding then but she was covered with blood—a very large portion of the bone was exposed it was about two inches long and of a very dangerous nature indeed—this chopper is a very likely instrument to have inflicted it—on the Monday I considered her too ill to go before the Magistrate—she went on the Wednesday and returned and remained till the following Tuesday and then went out of her own accord—I told her I did not consider her out of danger—the blow went off obliquely if the axe had fallen perpendicularly it would most likely have fractured her skull and from the appearance and the force would most probably have killed her Robert Greig a plasterer and Patrick M Carthy of Westminster gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY on 2nd Count —Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutrix and Jury on account of his children and his character — Transported for Seven Years 
t18500610-1072  1072 GEORGE HACKETT feloniously wounding John Storey on the head with intent to resist and prevent his lawful apprehension and detainer —2nd COUNT with intent to do him grievous bodily harm having been before convicted MESSRS RYLAND and LOCKE conducted the Prosecution GEORGE TREW City-policeman 26 On 4th April I obtained a warrant from Mr Alderman Gibbs for the apprehension of the prisoner for an assault on me—he was taken into custody by Storey on 24th and I was present at the Mansion-house when he was brought there on 25th—there was then a charge of burglary at Mr I Hardy s 125 New Bond-street made against him in consequence of which Mr Alderman Gibbs told us to take him to Marlborough-street Police-court the district where the burglary was committed—I went with him and there was a charge of burglary made against him there—he was remanded for a week—I went there again on 2nd May and he was not there then—he could not be found—I did not see him again till 29th ROBERT LESTER policeman C 148 I am deputy-gaoler at Marylebone Police-court—the prisoner was in my custody there on 2nd May—that was the first time I saw him—it was under remand on a charge of felony committed in Bond-street—I went to the cell for the purpose of taking him before the Magistrate and lie was gone—I have never discovered how he got away Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What time did you first see him on 2nd May A At a quarter-past ten o clock—the sergeant of the van brought him to me and I locked him up in the cell I am positive of that— the sergeant assisted me—he is not here—the lock to the cell is a Chubb s patent lock—it was not at all damaged—I went to the cell again at ten minutes or a quarter-past eleven—the door was then locked and bolted outside top and bottom and there were three prisoners remaining inside—they were put in at the same time as the prisoner—there were five altogether and two had escaped—there are no windows in the cell where prisoners could get out there are some small apertures in the door—the door shuts of itself and it is bolted top and bottom afterwards—it double-locks of itself—I never tried to open it from the inside when it was shut—I have not tried since this occurred nor has anybody in my presence—I have not the remotest idea how the prisoner got out—I am quite sure I did not leave the door open—I could not have left it open because you cannot bolt it without shutting it—no one watches the outside of the cells—I bolted the door top and bottom when I put the five prisoners in JOHN STOREY City policeman 414 I took the prisoner into custody on 24th April on the charge of an assault on George Trew—I took him before Mr Alderman Gibbs at the Mansion-house and there was there a charge made against him of a burglary in Bond-street and in consequence he was sent to Marlborough-street—I took him there with Trew—on 2nd May I was there when he was to have been brought up and was informed that he and another prisoner had escaped—in consequence of that I was on the look-out for him—on 29th May a little before eleven o clock in the day I was in King William-street and observed a cart going to cross the bridge towards the Surrey side with a female in it and a man who I knew to be a companion of the prisoner s—I followed the cart and it had not got many yards before I saw the prisoner peep his head up out of the body of the cart—I then went towards the cart—there was a stoppage and the prisoner jumped out of the cart—I pursued him to the west side of the bridge near the steps which go down to Thames-street when I closed with him and he drew this life-preserver from his breast pocket put his legs between mine and we both went down together—I cannot exactly say whether he fell upon me—while I was down he struck me with this life-preserver—my hat had fallen off and he struck me three successive times on the back of my head—I got up and closed with him again—we went down again—he then struck me once more and then got up and ran away towards King William-street—the blows made the blood run very much indeed and my clothes were all saturated with it—he went along King William-street down Arthur-street west down Miles -lane into Thames-street with this life-preserver in his hand and I crying out Stop thief and when any one attempted to stop him he made a blow at them—he was at last stopped by a man named Cheer when I was a few yards from him—he made an aim at Cheer with the life-preserver and I then caught hold of him—he kicked Cheer and me very much—Baldwin came up secured him and I let go of him and followed behind—he was taken to Garlic-hill station—he was very violent all the way—I went to Mr May close by who dressed my head and Mr Childs saw me the same day—I have not been able to do duty since—I saw Cheer wrench the life-preserver out of his hand and he gave it to me—my clothes were very much torn and covered with blood Cross-examined Q What did you first do when the prisoner got out of the cart A Ran after him—he had only crossed the road when I caught hold of him—I closed with him as I saw him draw the life-preserver—I took him round the body so as to keep his arms down—I held him as tight as I could to prevent his striking my temples—I did not strike him before he struck me—he did not complain at the time that I was squeezing him so that he could hardly breathe—there were several people by when I seized him but no one assisted me—I was in plain clothes—be has known we for years and I have known him from a boy—he knew I was an officer—I took him on the previous occasion when he escaped THOMAS CHEER I am a blind-maker and reside in East-street Walworth On Wednesday 29th May about half-past ten o clock in the morning I was near Miles -lane Cannon-street close by London-bridge I saw some persons standing at one end of Miles -lane—I heard them calling Stop thief —I saw the prisoner running down Miles -lane towards me—I made an attempt to stop him but he held up a life-preserver and endeavoured to strike me—I stepped aside and allowed him to pass and then turned round as he was turning the corner into Thames-street closed on him and seized him—we had a scuffle and both fell—I placed my right knee on his neck or head to hold him down—he made a scuffle to try to get up—he tried to lift up the life-preserver to strike me and I stamped it down with my feet and got it from him—I afterwards gave it to Storey when he came up—another policeman then came up and he was taken to the station—on the way to the station I was kicked by the prisoner severely in the upper part of my body and I have not been able to follow my labour since JAMS M CLOUD ROBERTSON I am a commission-agent in Lower Thames-street On the morning of 29th May I saw the prisoner on London-bridge running from Storey across from the lower part of the bridge to the west side where I was—I saw Storey come up with him and put both his arms round his neck—the prisoner then endeavoured to trip him up and they both fell together Cross-examined Q Did you see whether the officer fell against any place that he could have hurt his head A I saw him fall and there was no place decidedly that could have hurt his head WILLIAM CASTALL I am a surgeon On Wednesday 29th May Storey was brought to my house in Bow-lane—I examined his head—it was covered with blood and his hair was saturated with blood—on the upper part of the back part of his head I found a ragged bruised wound about an inch and a half or two inches long—the skin was completely separated and it was bleeding very much—it had perhaps been bleeding more than when I saw it—I think such an instrument as this would produce such a wound—I did what was necessary at the time and have not seen him professionally since Cross-examined Q Suppose three blows to have been given with a life-preserver would you not have expected to discover more wounds than you saw A A blow with a life-preserver might or might not produce a wound according to the direction in which it was struck many circumstances might prevent it—I think if the blows fell in different parts they would produce different wounds—I cleansed it and removed some small parts of skin which were so much injured as to prevent the union of the wound GEORGE BORLASE CHILDS I am surgeon to the City police I visited Storey on the afternoon of 29th May about four o clock at his home—he was in bed—I examined his bead and found that he had received a contused wound of more than an inch in extent at the upper and back-part of his head—he appeared to have lost a large quantity of blood judging from his clothes—he complained of dimness of the sight and noise in the ears clearly indicating that the brain had sustained a very severe shock of some kind—he has remained under my care to this day and still complains of those symptoms but in a less aggravated form—he is not fit at present to go on duty—I should say it is more than probable that the wound might have been produced by such an instrument as this WILLIAM DIXON policeman E 81 I produce a certificate which I got from the Clerk of the Peace s office for Middlesex— read—George Thomson convicted Feb 1848 and confined nine months —I know the prisoner he is the person named in that certificate—at that time he went by the name of George Thompson GUILTY Aged 23 — Transported for

t18500819-1544  1544 JOHN EDWARD PERCEVAL feloniously attempting to drown Alexander Shirreff with intent to murder him MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution ALEXANDER SHIRREFF I am secretary to the East-country Dock Company Rotherhithe and am in my seventy-fifth year I know the prisoner working in the docks as one of the deal-porters—on the morning of 26th June I found fault with the foreman of the deal-porters and objected to the prisoner s being employed—he was discharged by my direction between nine and ten o clock—about a quarter-past three that afternoon I was walking round the dock my usual practice at that time of day and at the south side the prisoner came up to me—he seemed to be waiting for me—I was walking on the edge of the wharf as I usually do going back to the office when the prisoner came from among the deals and said Sir the foreman has discharged me this morning I wish to know the reason why —I just looked at him I did not want to speak to him I said I am not under any necessity of explaining my conduct to you go about your business —he gave me no answer and I walked on—I passed him—there were gates on that side—I thought perhaps he had obeyed my order and gone about his business but I had hardly passed him a few paces and was walking on the edge of the dock before I received a tremendous push on my back which launched me right into the dock head-foremost where it is eighteen feet deep—I went a good way below and when I came up I as a good way from the wharf—I found I could swim though I had not tried for forty years and never with my clothes and heavy shoes on—however I got on very well and did not lose my presence of mind—there was no access up the wharf it was six or seven feet up—there was not a boat on that side of the dock—some men came running to the spot when I could not have swam much longer for I found my legs going down before I got to the wharf—I got hold of one of the pillars but there was no way of getting up—they lowered one man down and I got hold of his legs and he got hold of my hand and shoulder and I was taken up—if I could not have swam no man could have come to my assistance in less than a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes and I must have sunk—the prisoner was quite sober when he spoke to me—he spoke quite distinctly and walked perfectly well Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How long has he been employed in the docks A Perhaps two years altogether but never regularly—I have been superintendent upwards of twenty years—a man named Percival is the foreman of the deal-porters—I do not know that he is a relation of the prisoner—I have been told that he is a half-brother—I first caused the prisoner to be discharged a year or two ago when a large stone came upon me as I was turning a corner and I made inquiry among the deal-porters and said I would discharge every soul if they did not tell me who it was and at last they pointed out the prisoner and his excuse was that it was a lark—I told him I did not understand such larks and he had better go about his business which he did and I told him not to come back to the docks again—he said it was a turnip that he threw but I found a good many stones but no turnips and I do not believe there were any—since then I have seen him occasionally working temporarily—I never saw him there but I found fault with him not from that transaction but from inquiry about his character—he was not there for twelve months afterwards—he never applied to me to be allowed to work there—he never brought me a letter from Mr Blick the Clergyman of Rotherhithe—he never spoke to me in his life except on the day he threw the stone and the day he threw me into the dock—if Mr Blick wrote a letter I am positive I did not receive it he may casually have written me a note but not about any man whatever THOMAS LIDDELL I am a carpenter and live at the East Country Dock On 20th June I was with Mr Shirreff and saw the prisoner come up—he walked past Mr Shirreff while he was speaking to me—we were two or three feet from the edge of the wharf which was repairing—Mr Shirreff walked ahead about fifty yards along the path by the side of the bason—the prisoner was waiting for him and I saw them speaking—Mr Shirreff walked two or three yards a head and the prisoner ran with force behind him pushed him into the water and then ran away down the dock—Mr Shirreff came up fourteen or twenty feet from the edge of the wharf and swam to the edge of the basin—I lowered a man who was there and Mr Shirreff caught hold of his legs and we held him for a few minutes till farther assistance came and we succeeded in getting him up—the water was eighteen feet deep—it was seven or eight feet at the edge of the wharf—if he had not been able to swim we should have had to have gone round to the other side for a boat which would have taken a quarter of an hour—he could not have got out by himself Cross-examined Q How many other persons were there A Four or five more—I have seen the prisoner employed in the docks—there was no chain round the dock for persons to lay hold of who happen to fall in—Mr Shirreff was about three feet from the edge when the prisoner came behind him JOHN LYNCH I live at Ship-court Deptford and am a deal-porter at the East Country Docks—I know the prisoner I saw him in the docks between ten and eleven o clock on the day in question with some men who were sitting down to have a pint of beer—I heard him saying to them that if Mr Shirreff came out that day he would have him into the dock if he went in with him Cross-examined Q Was

life-preserver would produce the injuries but it mast have been used with considerable force Cross-examined Q Did not he appear a great deal shaken A Yes it was all the injuries together that put him into that state—his kidneys must have been injured for the urine was tinged with blood for some days—that might have been produced by a fall EDWARD WOOD I gave a description to Sergeant Wright of

harm Ms CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution THOMAS GENTLE policeman 5 101 On 26th June last at half-part 12 o clock at night I was in the Grange-road Camden-town and saw the prisoner there with his wife and Mrs Bryan she was assisting the prisoner in leading his wife along—the prisoner had been drinking—I believe his wife was perfectly sober—she was groaning very much—I asked what was the matter—she said Oh policeman my life is in your hands this man has stabbed me —I said Where has he stabbed you —she put her hand to her stomach and said Oh my entrails are coming out —the prisoner said I have done it and I am only sorry they were not both together I would have served them both alike —he mentioned some man s name as well—I then conveyed her to the nearest surgeon s Mr Mushat s—he was not at home—I got two other constables to assist me—I took the prisoner to the station and the woman was taken to the hospital—I believe the prisoner knew what he was doing—he was considerably in liquor BRIDGET BRYAN I am married and live in Ferdinand-place Camdentown I know the prisoner and his wife On 26th June she was lodging in Caroline-place Camden-town—about 10 o clock that night I went to where she lived and knocked at the door—I found the prisoner there with his wife—they were arguing that is quarrelling—I told them to be quiet—she was sober—we all came down-stairs into the street—the prisoner asked her to have a drop of beer—she said No —he put his hand to her back and pushed her before him and I made myself agreeable for peace—he asked her again to have some drink—we went but she would have none of the first there were two pots—she had a little—he then said Are you not my wife — Yes — Am I not your husband — Yes — Will you not come home with me — No —and she would not let him go home with her she denied him everything—after we had come along a little way he bid us good night and we thought he was gone away—he did not say that he would do anything if she did not come not in my hearing—my deposition was read over to me and I made my mark to it—this is it looking at it —I wanted to go and she pulled me back and wished me to stay—he was all the time asking her to come home and she would not go with him—I really do not know whether he said he would do anything if she did not come—I am so confused I can hardly think of it—I think he said he would do for her or something if the did not come home with him—after that he bid her good night and we thought he was clear of us—he came back and called her—she turned back—she thought he was going to strike her and put up her hands and he then made a dart at her—he did not say anything at the time he ran away—I think he said There I have done that for you —she hallooed out Oh Mrs Bryan I am stabbed —I did not see what he struck her with—I looked behind and saw streams of blood flowing—I assisted her a little way and then the prisoner came back and laid hold of her and assisted me in holding her up till the policeman came—I said to him Sullivan you have killed your wife —he said Oh no she is not dead yet —in consequence of what she said when she laid down by the doctor s door I put my hand under her clothes and put my fingers on the guts FRANCIS POLTOCK policeman S 46 I know the prisoner—I have been in the habit of seeing him on my beat in Camden-town—about three weeks before this transaction I saw him in Ferdinand-place—I was not aware that he lived in that street but I knew that his wife lived there—it was about half-past 9 o clock at night—he had got a mob of people round him and was calling his wife very bad names—he called her a b—wh— and a b—b— and said he would do for her—I think he was sober—he might have been drinking—he did not say it to anybody in particular—he said so in front of the mob—he said Tbe b—b— if she don t let me come in I will do for her —I went up and said to him My good man go away and let the woman alone she will not let you come in and you had better go away Prisoner I never used the expression Witness He did I am not mistaken in the expression—I got him away—on the night of 26th June in consequence of an application that was made to me I went into the Hampstead-road and found the prosecutrix lying on the pavement—I saw blood coining through her clothes—the prisoner looked up at me and said I have done for the b—b—at last —I am quite sure I am not mistaken as to that—I think he must have been drinking by his appearance—he seemed very much excited—I got a cab and took the woman to the hospital—I knew that the prisoner was living apart from her from what the neighbours said and from what he said himself JULIA SULLIVAN The prisoner is my husband On the night of 26th June I was taken to the hospital—I remained there eleven weeks and am there up to this time—on 26th June I was living apart from my husband and had been doing so about five weeks—before 26th June I lived with him in Ferdinand-place—my husband has repeatedly come to my place for the purpose of getting me to live with him and I refused—on 26th he came between 9 and 10 o clock at night came into my room I was just sitting down—he took hold of me by my left-hand and said Old lady I have dropped upon you at last —I think he was sober—I did not see any sign of drink on him—I answered You have left me no home and I shan t go with you I will do for myself and get my own living —I had work then from a gentleman in the same street—I had just come in from work when this happened—an old lady keeps the room—my bed was in it—the prisoner sat himself on the bedside and said Will you come home with me or shall I stop with you —I then gave him the answer I have stated—he had on a jacket and I saw him put his finger to the jacket-sleeve to something which I thought he had in the sleeve—I said to him What have you got in your jacket-sleeve —he said Why you foolish woman do you think I have anything in my jacket-sleeve to take away your life and send my soul to the devil —with that Mrs Bryan knocked at the door—I said Come in —I asked her to sit down—I was very glad to see her in the room—the prisoner then proposed some beer and said he would stand It—he still had hold of my hand—I said I should go for the beer—he said we should all go out and have it—we went out and went to a public-house kept by Mr Gurney—it was a goodish distance from my lodging I believe in the high road—he called for a pot of beer between the three of us—he paid for it—after it was drunk he asked me to stand a pot of beer—I told him I had no beer-money to spend—we then all went out together and went to another public-house in Kentish-town—he called for a pot of beer there—I made signs to the landlady not to serve him and she did not—he was not tipsy at that time but he was cross-like—I saw him drinking part of the pot of beer with me that was all—we then went into the Black Horse in Kentish-town and there he was served with a pot of beer—Mrs Bryan was still with us—we did not sit down at all in that public-house—we were there about a quarter of an hour—the clock was then on the stroke of 12—we then came out together and came down the Kentish-town-road as for as a turning towards my lodging—I said to Mrs Bryan Do not go far away stand where you are I shall be back in a few minutes —at the same time I shook hands with the prisoner and said Good night God bless you and get to bed as well as you can and I will meet you to-morrow night anywhere you like to make an appointment —he then went on towards the bridge but did not go very far—I followed Mrs Bryan towards Ferdinand-place—the prisoner called after me by my maiden name Julia and I returned—he said nothing more—I saw him bring his hand from behind his buck or from his pocket—I put my hands before my face—I thought he was going to strike me on the face—I did not feel anything touch me—I did not feel the knife at all before I felt the blood running down my legs from my stomach—I put my hand under my clothes and found myself cut—the top of my finger went info the cut and I found that part of my entrails were coming out and I was streaming with blood—I did what I could to retain my entrails—I sat down on the kerb and called Mrs Bryan to my assistance and said that I was stabbed—the prisoner went off a little way but returned again as I was sitting on the kerb—Mrs Bryan said Oh Mr Sullivan you have killed your wife —he said She is not dead yet what does she want sitting down here —he came and laid hold of my arm—I still had my hands on my stomach endeavouring to retain my bowels—he on one side and Mrs Bryan on the other brought me to Dr Mushat s—I saw a policeman and said to him I throw my life in your hands —he came along with me but I was getting very weak and by the time I got as Mr Mushat s I had not a bit of sight—when the prisoner was asking me to come home with him and I refused he said If you don t come home with me on this night it will be either death or glory and swore—I said If you do anything to me you will be surely punished for it you will surely suffer for it both in this world and in the next too COURT Q How long have you been married to him A About eleven years—I have had three children by him—none of them are living—I have been married before—I had eight children by my first husband—they are is Ireland or in America—they are grown up and able to take care of themselves—I had no child living with me at this time—I had been parted from the prisoner four or five weeks—I was not living alone in this room—Mrs M Donald a widow was living with me—there was no man living with me—I am sure of that—I had never seen the prisoner inside the door for five weeks till he came—he was wanting me from time to time to come back and I was refusing Prisoner Did not she go away from me to live with another man and stay with him three or four weeks he said he was a single man and she gave him money to buy clothes and he sent it to his wife in Ireland Witness He accuses me of what I know nothing about—I never went away from him for three weeks MR CLARKSON Q Be cautious this is a very serious matter on your oath have you ever been unfaithful to him as a wife A Never in my life he cannot bring any one to say I have been deceitful to him—he has been a murderer to me and always was THOMAS WALSH I am thirteen years old and live at 4 Haverstock-street Hampstead-road On the morning of 27th June I opened the shop No 17 Hampton-terrace which is a china-shop where I am errand boy—it is about three minutes walk from Ferdinand-place—I saw a knife lying in the area—I picked it up it was shut—there were stains like blood on the handle—Mr Mushat s the doctor s is next door—I knew nothing about this occurrence at that time—I sold the knife to a man at the Railway Tavern—I after wards got it back from him when I heard that the woman had been stabbed and it was kept in the shop till my mistress gave it to the policeman—I was not present then—this is the knife produced THOMAS GENTLE re-examined I know the house 17 Hampton-terrace next door to Mr Mushat s—in taking the woman there the prisoner was with me—we had to pass the area of No 17—another officer received this knife from Mrs Walsh JOSEPH LISTER I am house-surgeon of University College Hospital The prosecutrix was brought there about 10 o clock on the night of 27th June—she was then in the casualty-ward lying on a stretcher—I examined the lower part of the abdomen—I found both on the outer and under garments a vertical cut about two-thirds of an inch long—they were wet with blood and the contents of the intestines—on removing the clothes I found a coil of intestine about eight inches across comprehending perhaps about a yard of the small intestines protruding from the lower part of the abdomen in a red congested state—the most prominent part of this coil presented two wounds in the intestine itself they were almost opposite to each other transfixed somewhat obliquely—it is no doubt that the two wounds were made by a single stroke—the contents of the intestine both fasces and flatus were acaping at the time there was also a wound in the mesentery—those wounds were of about the same length as the cut in the clothes—no doubt all was done by one instrument and one stroke—the entrails were cleansed with water about the temperature of blood and I then attempted to return a part of them prior to sewing up the wound—I found it necessary to make the cioatrix wider in order to do so—I was enabled finally to restore them—the injury she had received was excessively dangerous—she is now perfectly recovered as far as we could judge COURT Q How many garments were cut through before the body was cut A The clothes had been somewhat disturbed before she came in—there were only two garments in their proper position I am not sure which they were certainly the shift and one other garment—the knife produced is precisely suited to the production of such an injury Prisoner s Defence When I went to demand this woman she was standing at the door waiting for the man she lives with we came out and were drinking together she had told me before that she would have a better man than me and she said she had got him about a fortnight before that he had met me in the street and knocked me down and said You must not come here to demand your wife any more if you do I will break your head I had my eye poulticed for a whole week and could hardly see for a fortnight she had been lodging with him there for about a month she gave him money to buy clothes and he sent the money for his wife to Ireland and then turned her out I had been out drinking and so had she I was drunk when I came to her but she will swear anything she would swear she has not been convicted here of stealing silver-spoons in Holborn and had twelve months she told me she would have a better man than me and said I was no good now she would not come with me or let me stay with her I should not have gone near her if I had not been drunk I do not know whether I did it or whether I did not do it I have some witnesses outside John White Jerry Shannon and Henry White there were as many knives produced against me at Marylebone as would surprise you there was a fresh knife every week for eleven weeks THOMAS GENTLE re-examined This is the first knife I had in my possession—it has never been changed JULIA SULLIVAN re-examined I have never been convicted of stealing—I was never in a court or office till he brought me to it on

and the man—I had lent the prisoner 1l about the 6th July—I made application to him for it on the 11th Sept as he received his salary—he told me he could pay me on the morrow if he liked but he would not and I might whoop for the money—the next morning I applied to him again—I asked him in a friendly manner if he would tell me when he would pay me—that was about 20 minutes-past 8 o clock—I had told him the night before that I would go to the Lord Mayor about it and I would tell my master and mistress—nothing further occurred on the 12th till about G o clock in the evening when I was in the kitchen stooping down putting lucifers into the fire which had been dying out for about two hours—the prisoner had come in the kitchen perhaps a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before this—there was no conversation took place between us—while I was attempting to light the fire he came behind me and stabbed me twice in the nose—I thought it was blows with a fist—I saw afterwards what instrument it was done with—I tried to get up and he held me forcibly down by my neck—with one hand he was cutting me and with the other he was holding me forcibly down by my neck with his hand over my head—he pulled my head down—I was still before the fire—I could not move—I tried to get up and he pressed my head against the bars—I slipped from his grasp for an instant and I saw the knife in his right-hand in the act of cutting at my breast—I endeavoured to get up and when I saw the knife I began to scream out—he bent me down and pressed my head between his knees—he still held me in the same position—he never entirely let go from the time he first seized me with his left-hand—my head being between his knees he doubled me down and cut me as I thought between my shoulders—he then threw my head forwards threw me down threw the knife on the side board and left the kitchen—I had been crying Murder from the time I first saw the knife till he left the kitchen—he did not say a word—in consequence of my screams a person came to my assistance in a few minutes after the prisoner left the kitchen—I was faint with loss of blood but I managed to walk across the kitchen—I had not given the prisoner any provocation only by telling him I should go to the Lord Mayor—there had been no conversation during the quarter of an hour Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you say anything to him that day A Not after the morning—I cannot tell whether he had been drinking—he was writing a few minutes before writing what he had laid out that day—I saw him go to the desk and take out bills and look at them and he counted his money—I am quite sure I did not say anything ELIZABETH GERRARD I am a widow I was nurse at Mr Terry s On 12th Sept I heard screams about 6 o clock in the evening—I in consequence went to the kitchen—I found Rotheroe sitting on a chair in a fainting state and saw the blood flowing from her head and her bands—I went and got some water as she was in such a fainting state—I was afraid she would fall off the chair—I passed round behind her and saw the blood running down her back and through her dress—I sent for a surgeon who came almost immediately after—I saw the knife on the side-board—there was blood on it and it was bent—I had not seen the prisoner previous to that any further than he passed into the yard with a roll of oil-cloth on his shoulder a little after 6—I did not see any appearance of his having been drinking—this is the knife produced JAMES BRENNAN I am on inspector of the 6 division of police I was called to Mr Terry s on 12th Sept between 6 and 7 o clock in the evening—I received this knife from the medical gentleman Mr South wood—I received a description of the prisoner and went in search of him—on the following day I went to 38 Gloucester-street Hoxton and in the second-floor front-room I saw the prisoner—I told him I belonged to the police and he answered the description of a person I was in search of for stabbing the cook at Mr Terry s house in Chiswell-street the evening before—he made no answer for a little time and then he said It is right enough I suppose I must make myself at your service —I took him to the station—I went to the hospital and saw the prosecutrix—on the following Monday I received this gown which I produce—it is cut in the back ELIZA ROTHEROE re-examined This is my gown and the one I had on at the time—I cannot swear to this knife it looks like it JOHN SOUTHWOOD I am a surgeon and live in Fore-street Cripplegate On the 12th Sept I was called to Mr Terry s—I found the prosecutrix in a very faint state lying before the kitchen fire her face was covered with blood—I examined her person—I found a deep cut on her nose a cut on the thumb and finger of her left hand and two deep cuts on the back of her neck—one of them was nearly five inches deep and the other about three inches each of them about an inch and a half wide in the widest part—I saw this knife lying there at the time—it is precisely the instrument that would cause such wounds—one of the wounds in fact was curved precisely as this knife is curved—the wounds were dangerous to life Thomas Harris a scale-maker Edmund Page a publican and William Tremont a publican gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY on the third Count Aged 20 — Transported for Fifteen Years

with intent to do her grievous bodily harm MR THOMPSON conducted the Prosecution HARRIET DONNO I am married but I do not know whether my husband is living I lived with the prisoner as his wife for about two years and passed by the name of Matthews—on 13th Nov between 11 and 12 o clock I told the prisoner I should leave him and get a lodging elsewhere—I said I would not pledge my clothes any more for him—I do not know what answer he gave me—he left home directly afterwards with Appleton—on the evening of that day I went to a public-house with three young women and two young men—I drank there and was very much the worse for liquor—we also had some pies and whilst eating and drinking the prisoner and Appleton came in—the prisoner asked me if I would go home with him—I said I would not come home and I was very aggravating to him—I kept saying to him You go by yourself I won t go home I knew there was nothing that aggravated him more than that—I went outside with him and he asked if I would come home—I told him I would not he might go by himself and he asked me for 2d to get a pint of beer with—Appleton said Let her go in again because she should not be laughed at —I was not so drunk then as I was afterwards—I went into the tap-room again and the three young women and the two young men and me got quarreling and I took off my bonnet and shawl—the prisoner was then standing at the fireplace at my side—I received a wound and found blood flowing from my neck—I cannot say who gave me the wound—we were all quarreling together—I knew no more till I found myself at the hospital

both quite sober—we went home and found the female was not there—we sat down and eat some bread and the prisoner said Bill let us come and see if we can find Harriet and we went to her mistress s where she used to work at slopwork—she was not there and the prisoner said Let us come to the Duke of York in Brick-lane —we went there and found her sitting in the tap-room with three other women and two men drinking—she was rather tipsy and the prisoner asked her if she would come out a minute he wanted to speak to her—after asking her two or three times she said I shall not come till I have eaten my pie —about ten minutes after she had eaten her pie Matthews again asked her to come out—she came out and they went outside the door and the prisoner asked her would she come home and go to bed—she said No I will go in and bid them good-bye first —she went in and sat down and poured out a glass of gin and drank it and likewise handed the prisoner one and he drank it and sat down on the corner of the table smoking—about ten minutes after they had come in there was a bit of a quarrel between the prosecutrix and another female and the prosecutrix pulled off her bonnet and shawl and began fighting—the prisoner was then standing at the fire at my side—they left off fighting and the prosecutrix sat down with the other female about three yards off Matthews—Matthews walked up to the prosecutrix put his hand into his right coat-pocket pulled out this white-handled knife and drew it along the prosecutrix s throat just under the left chin—the prosecutrix sat on the form bleeding and then she was laid on the floor and she kept crying out Mother mother Jim Jim —the prisoner came to me and said Bill I have done it go and get a policeman —I said Done what —he said Cut her throat go and get a policeman —I know the knife I have been in the habit of seeing it for five weeks or a month while I have worked for the prisoner—it was generally kept on the table—I had seen the prisoner sharpening it that morning with a little file—he then tried it on a bit of wood and said It will not cut now Cross-examined Q What time was it when he was sharpening the knife A As soon as we had had our breakfast before the prosecutrix said she was going to take another room—they appeared to live very comfortably together ANN DOWNEY I am single and live at Raven-street Stepney I was in company

called to the Duke of York I went into the tap-room—the prisoner bounced towards me as soon as I went in and said I have done it I will go with you I am sorry for it I hope I shall be hung for it —I saw the prosecutrix lying on the floor and a surgeon attending her—I received this knife from the landlady—at the station the prisoner said he had done it for her he had told her he should and he hoped he should be hung for it she had aggravated him to it JACKSON GOODENOUGH KENT I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital The prosecutrix was brought there on 13th Nov —she had been bleeding very

annoyed me ever since I have been in the place —I said Why did not you tell me —he went out I followed and gave him into custody—I saw my son s wounds I fetched a doctor Prisoner There is no reason to suppose that a person like me would do this I suppose I am one of the first bootmakers in England DENNIS DONOVAN policeman L 48 I took the prisoner—I found this knife on him which was bloody—I saw the prosecutor he was very much injured—the surgeon dressed twelve or fourteen wounds on him Prisoner s Defence I was three weeks in this country my tools are the heaviest tools in the land when I came I bad just 8d I got a quartern of butter and a half quartern loaf that does sometimes keep a person in my line of life a week we cannot afford much I roamed very much through this land to the extreme of it I was grieved though I could say nothing I was confined to a bit of bread and one cap of tea I had one pair of shoes in hand and my grievance was great being confined to one meal after the hardship of travel I am bred a boot maker to man s work and it was women s work I had the lowest of all work when the week was over I was not able to leave the house there was a dreadful fog not more than four hours daylight on the third week I thought to get a meal I was passing by a butcher s shop and bought a bullock s cheek there was four pounds of it at 2d a pound I thought it would make some good soup for me I had a bit fried of it and about another half pound cooked with a parsnip which cost me a penny this was taken from me but I never revolted for that there was no cupboard I took the food up stairs where I worked they were grieved at that and this young fellow I had great grievance with which caused me to moan and sigh and he repeated them as well as a comedian to my great terror he is one of the greatest cannibals in man s nature when he was at work be would make motions with his mouth quite grinning they were the most rejected persons I ever saw this morning he got on in this way and kept it on with great force I spoke a couple of words that irritated him and he gave me a push out of bed I did not resent it in the least I got up and lit a candle I had this small pointed knife in my hand I took that and gave the wick of the candle a poke to open the wick I had only my trowsers on I went to the bed to get my waistcoat he repeated the insult again I got hold of him by the hair on the forehead to get him out of bed he made many attempts to bite me a sort of cannibal attempt GUILTY Aged 50 The jury requested that inquiries might be made respecting his state of mind the result of which did not become public but on a subsequent day MR JUSTICE ERLE sentenced the prisoner to be Transported for Seven Years Before Mr Common Serjeant 
t18520223-311  311 BERTO MAYO ARGENTI and FRANCISCO MORATI feloniously assaulting Peter Getland upon the high seas and wounding him with intent to murder him —2nd COUNT with intent to do him grievous bodily harm MESSRS BODKIN and CLERK conducted the Prosecution JAMES COLWELL I am a mariner In Jan 1850 I shipped as steward on board the bark Alberta at Liverpool—she was an English vessel and sailed under English colours—Captain Benson a Scotchman was the master of the bark and the shipping-agents at Liverpool were Messrs Wilkie and Simpson—the prisoners shipped as able seamen at the same time that I did and the deceased Peter Getland also—if I am not very much mistaken he signed the articles next to me or next to the cook I know his name was very near first on the articles—Argenti went on board the vessel by the name of Berto Urgent and we used to call Morati Frank or Frank Murray and sometimes Antonie—we left Liverpool on 30th Jan —on 15th April when we were nearing the American coast there was a bit of a row forward between Morati from what I see first of all and Peter Getland—they were fighting—I told the captain who was at breakfast and he and the mate came out of the cabin and they and the rest of the men interfered to separate them—one of the men I cannot say who sung out that they had got their knives open—I saw Argenti interfering in the fight and when some of them sung out that they had their knives the captain ordered him to be brought aft—I think he was fighting with the rest of them because they all interfered—I think he was fighting for Morati as well as I could see—I think he had a stick in his hand but I know he was fighting and his mouth was bloody—the captain ordered both Argenti and Morati to be brought aft—they were brought aft with a great deal of struggling—they were very obstreperous we could not get them aft very well—I took a large knifefrom inside Argenti s shirt and a smalt pocket-knife what they call a jack-knife from Morati and the prisoners were then made fast to the mizen by the captain s orders—the whole ship s company assisted in doing that—Getland assisted—they remained fast to the mizen about an hour or an hour and a half—they then begged the mate s pardon and said they would not do it any more if he would let them go—the mate was Mr Gordon Gold—he set them at liberty at their request—the captain was asleep at the time—two days after that we were at anchor at Mobile Bay which is on the coast of Alabama—we were about twenty-five miles from the town and about five from shore either side—the captain went on shore on the evening of 16th or morning of 17th—on the evening of 17th about 10 minutes past 7 o clock the prisoners were sitting on the night-heads on the top-gallant forecastle which is right forward about six feet above the rest of the deck—Getland was sitting on the wind lass on the larboard side smoking—the windlass is on the deck just abaft and below the forecastle Getland was about six or seven feet under where the prisoners were—Getland was talking me about boarding-houses in Liverpool and Argenti walked along theforesastle came over his head and caught him over the head with the sharp edge of the axe—Morati was just along side of him not quite half a step back—the axe struck Getland close to the crown of his head—the wound was about six inches in length and it penetrated to the brain for I saw the brain on the axe—there was a great deal of blood flowed and Wilson carried him aft—as soon as I gave the alarm Argenti made a blow at me with the axe—the proper place for the axe to be kept was in the galley—it belonged to the cook and nobody used it except the steward might take it to break a bone sometimes—there was no occasion for it on the forecastle—the prisoners then escaped into the foretop and remained there all night and with the ropes they made a sort of bulk-head or battery to prevent our getting at them—during the night a knife was thrown out of the foretop I could not say by which of them—I did not see it thrown—I heard it fall and it was picked up next morning—no one was in the foretop but the prisoners—it was my knife—we chased them out of the foretop and asked them to come down but they would not—a revenue-cutter came on board of us and the captain of the cutter threatened to fire at them if they did not come down—he gave them five minutes and then they came down—one of them I think it was Morati said they would come down for an American man but they would not come down for a b—Englishman—one of them said they should only get about a month or so in America for killing a man—I think it was Morati said that but it is so long ago it has rather slipped my memory—they both speak English as well as any foreigners do I think Morati speaks it best—Getland was taken on shore on the morning of 18th and I did not see him again—this is the axe produced Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Had not Argenti been a quiet peaceable man before this A Yes I had always seen him very quiet and very sociable—I never saw him do anything wrong before—the prisoners were the only foreigners on board except Getland who was a Swede or Norwegian—the crew had not as I heard been teasing the prisoners about being foreigners BENJAMIN WILSON I was a seaman on board the Alberta she was a British ship and left Liverpool in Jan —I remember Getland having a quarrel with Morati on 15th April and Argenti interfered to prevent the row—there was very little fighting—the prisoners were afterwards fastened to the mast hy order of the captain and released in a short time—I was on board on 17th but did not see Getland struck—I heard Colwell call out Murder and found Getland leaning against the larboard rails inside with his head down and bleeding very much—the two prisoners were then on the topgallant forecastle about five feet from me—Getland s forehead was cut open and was bleeding very much the bone was split—he was taken ashore next day and I did not see any more of him—we remained there till 24th April and then went to Quebec—the prisoners were there taken into custody and brought to England MORATI— GUILTY on 2nd Count —Aged 26 / ARGENTI—

t18520223-344  344 EDWARD STAGGLES feloniously shooting at Henry Francis Collier Barber with intent to kill and murder —2nd COUNT to do him some grievous bodily harm MR LILLEY conducted the Prosecution HENRY FRANCIS COLLIER BARBER I am a chemist and reside at Jamaica Level Bermondsey in the parish of St Mary Magdalen Bermondsey On the night of 11th Feb I was going round my premises with a candle as usual ahout half-past 10 o clock and while passing through the yard of my premises a quantity of sulphuric and tartaric acid was thrown in my face—it produced most violent pain and more particularly an irritation of the eye— it bled for a time—some of the acid went in my mouth and it put out the candle—I called for another light and I rushed out at the side door the only way the person could escape by and locked the door after me—that was the only door he was likely to get out of he might have gone a circuitous way round—I ran and washed my eye with water and went to the bottom of my garden—I called the assistance of Mr Phillips he came to my assistance—he remained at the top of the garden at the great gates leading to the road in the first instance—I got a light and searched my premises—I heard a shuffling footstep up stairs in the top loft—I traced them from floor to floor—I first went in the ground floor then in the floor above that—I heard the shuffling of feet over my head—I called out to Mr Phillips that I had them safe and he might now come to my assistance—I then advanced to the foot of a broad step ladder leading to the upper floor—there is a trap door in the centre of the building—I advanced to the ladder and saw some person standing at the top of the ladder with two pistols in his hand—I had the light in my hand which I held above my head—the person had the pistols rather crossways in his hands—they appeared to me to be in this position crossing his hands but the light was indistinct I could not see exactly—on setting my foot on the first step of the ladder the prisoner was at the top and fired—the ladder was from seven to eight feet long—the floors are the height of sugar baker s floors seven feet high—I can undertake to say that the pistol which was fired was loaded with something that which it was loaded with struck the candlestick out of my hand and knocked a piece off my fore-finger—the ball struck me on the forehead and went through the hair of my head—my hand was at that time holding the light above my head—I had a brass chamber candlestick in my hand—I persisted in going up the ladder and the prisoner fired a second pistol—the contents of that went down my back making a superficial wound as it passed passing through my shirt and outer garments—it broke the skin—I cannot say how deep it was—I could not see it myself being at the back of my shoulder—I believe it was but slight—I went up the ladder to the floor and secured the prisoner—I took the two pistols from him—I delivered him to the policeman who had by that time arrived—these produced are the pistols I took from the prisone they had been recently fired—they have percussion locks—I was present when the prisoner was searched a sort of steel box was found on him a few caps some pieces of lead and a few watch keys—the policeman took possession of the box and other things and I handed these pistols to him—these caps were not tried by me nor I do not know that they were tried in my presence Cross-examined by MR DEARSLEY Q At the time the pistol was fired you were going up the ladder A I was I had merely one foot on it—the wounds were not of that nature that I was obliged to have medical aid—they were merely grazes—at the time the prisoner fired he was not more than a yard from me—the ladder is about seven feet high I stood with one foot on it—I went and washed away what was thrown in my face immediately—it was a mixture of sulphuric acid and tartaric acid in a state of composition COURT Q Is that used in your manufactory A Yes there was a mixture of that there which a person could have access to—the prisoner had been employed by me but was not at that time—he had left of his own accord—he informed me that he had got a better situation MR DEARSLEY Q There was no ill-feeling between you A Not the slightest—previous to this he had borne a respectable character—his father was an old servant of mine many years—when I heard the shuffling of feet up stairs I fancied at the time that it sounded like the feet of more than one person—there was an exit by a circuitous route by which a person might have left the place—I do not know that when the prisoner was in my service he used to have pistols to amuse himself I should not have allowed it for an instant ALFRED PHILLIPS I live at Jamaica Level Bermondsey I am a gardener On 11th Feb about half-past 10 o clock in the evening I heard a cry for assistance come from Mr Barber s premises—I saw Mr Barber and I went to him—I remained outside a short time and I afterwards went on the premises—I followed Mr Barber through the lower part of the factory—I went up stairs—Mr Barber went up to the middle floor of the factory and as he was about to put his foot or had put his foot on the lower round of the ladder to go to the upper floor a pistol was fired from the upper floor—I saw some person standing on the top of the ladder which I ultimately found to be the prisoner—after the firing of the first pistol Mr Barber proceeded to go up the ladder and as he was ascending a second pistol was fired in the same direction—Mr Barber instantly flew up the ladder and got the prisoner—I assisted in securing him he had the two pistols in his hand—they were taken away from him—I looked at them they looked as if they had been recently fired—I handed the prisoner over to the policeman JOHN CARTHY policeman M 226 About half-past 10 o clock at night on 11th Feb I went to Mr Barber s premises—I saw the prisoner there he was given into custody by Mr Barber—Mr Barber told me in his presence that he had thrown acid into his face and had fired two shots and said Is not this a hanging matter —the prisoner said be could hang well—on the way to the station a female whom I did not know gave me this black mask—the prisoner saw it in my possession and he said It is mine I threw it away —when the female brought it me she said she had picked it up in the road and she saw the prisoner throw it away—I produce this steel box I found it on the prisoner it had tobacco in it and I found on his person five percussion caps four pieces of lead and some watch keys—they were all in one pocket I believe his trowsers pocket—I saw this bullet picked up on Mr Barber s premises it was lying on the floor in the middle floor of the warehouse—I saw it found by a young man a friend of Mr Barber s—it has been in my possession ever since Cross-examined Q Was that on the floor above the ladder A It was the floor on which Mr Barber was standing—there are two ladders one from the bottom to the second floor and then one to another floor—this was not on the floor above the second ladder—I know the floor Mr Barber was on when he was shot at it was at the bottom of the ladder on that floor COURT Q How far from the foot of the ladder was this bullet found A On one side of it I suppose a yard or a yard and a half from it it might be—I examined the premises to see if there were any marks of a bullet I did not find any—I looked on the same floor where I found this—I looked all over every place down below—I examined the wall on the opposite side—we examined the walls and the partition and found no mark HENRY MIDDLETON police sergeant M 2 I have a knowledge of firearms—about an hour and a half after the prisoner was locked up thia bullet was shown to me it is lead—it had been recently fired off—it had a dampness about it and smelt of fire COURT Q Is not the effect of firing a bullet to flatten it A No it may go through a person and not flatten it—I have been in the army and have had five wounds MR LILLEY Q Was the prisoner brought to the station A He was —the constable Carthy produced two pistols to me in presence of the prisoner—he asked me if they had been recently fired and fired with ball—I said I could not tell whether they had been loaded with ball but I believed they had been recently fired—the prisoner immediately said Yes they were fired and both loaded with ball Cross-examined Q Were you before the Magistrate A Yes I made this statement before the Magistrate COURT to JOHN CARTHY Q Were you the policeman who asked that question A Yes I did not tell that because I thought I would leave it to the sergeant—I heard the prisoner say what has been stated COURT to ALFRED PHILLIPS Q Did you see a wound on Mr Barber s back A I did it was about two inches long and one inch broad—I examined these clothes in Mr Barber s own house—here is a hole in the collar of this frock dress over the left shoulder and one lower in the back—I have his shirt here—here is blood on it and a hole COURT to MR BARBER Q Where did this blood come from on the front of the shirt A I presume from my finger and this behind is blood from the wound in my back Q Was there any mark on the lower part of your clothes where anything came out A No not below the shirt—I had a waistcoat on beside this shirt and frock—the waistcoat is not here—I never thought of it—there would doubtless be a hole in it—I did not see these things at the time they were taken off—I was stripped in my drawing-room—I was bathing my eye and face—I was in extreme agony GUILTY on the Second Count

t18520405-396  396 SAMUEL DANDY was indicted for feloniously shooting at William Veale with intent to murder him —2nd COUNT with intent to do grievous bodily harm MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM VEALE I live in Acacia-road St John s-wood and am a cowkeeper On Monday night 23rd Feb about 20 minutes past 7 o clock I was in the Edgeware-road about half a mile beyond the fourth mile stone—I passed a man with a white coat and a cap on—I believe the prisoner is the man but I cannot swear to him his face was towards the hedge—he walked after me about seventy or eighty yards—I think he was not more than a yard from me—I thought he was going to speak and looked round—he put his right hand down before him looked rather towards the hedge walked on much faster and passed me—I came on towards London—when I got within about forty or fifty yards of the third mile stone I heard some one walking behind me quite close to me and when he came close to me he fired—I think by the sound of the feet the person must have been within a yard of me at the time—the flash came round my face and I was struck just behind the ear with the shots—I think there were at least twenty shots fired into my head—there were three or four taken out of my ear—I bled a good deal—I was stunned and staggered into the road—I then ran about thirty yards towards London and I saw some person coming towards me and I looked up the road and saw a man in a white coat about seventy or eighty yards from me—I did not see any other person between him and me—I told the person I met that I was shot and said there was the man up the road—I do not recollect that he made me any answer but he kept on I thought he might be going after the man but I did not see anything more of him—I went as fast as I could to Kilburn to Mr Deacon s a friend s house there and he went with me to a doctor—as I was going I met a policeman—I told him the particulars and I believe he went to see for the man—I was examined by the surgeon —it was ten days before I got well—I do not know the prisoner at all—I was examined before the Magistrate and heard the Magistrate ask the prisoner whether he had any question to put to me—I think the answer he made was All that the gentleman has stated is quite true JURY Q Was it light or dark at the time A Quite dark and there were some high trees just at the place where I was shot which made it still darker ZACHARIAH HOLLIER police-sergeant S 27 I took the prisoner into custody at Newport Pagnell in consequence of a description I had received from inspector Chambers I went on horseback and at two or three places on the road I heard of such a man but did not see him till I got to Newport Pagnell which is fifty-one miles from London—I was stopping in the street to make inquiry and saw the prisoner coming down the town—I turned into a public-house yard and stood in the gateway till he came up—I then stopped him and said Where do you come from —he said From Melton Mowbray —I said What is your name —he said Charles Williams —I said I am an officer and you must consider yourself in my custody —I took him into the public-house and told him I apprehended him for shooting a gentleman at Kilburn—he said several times Oh you must make a mistake —I said Whether it is a mistake or not I shall take you back to London —I said to him You lived in this neighbourhood once did not you —he said Yes I did I lived at the Rev Mr Townsend s —I took him to the station searched him and found on him this pistol produced —it was loaded with powder and shot and I found on him a paper containing shot and a paper containing powder and percussion caps a penny a comb a glove and an old handkerchief—I brought him to London by the railway—I went to Mr Veale s house and saw the surgeon extract this shot produced from his ear—I should say it is the same kind of shot that the prisoner had on him—I think it is a No 5 shot—I was at Bushey on the previous Friday to this and I fancy I saw the prisoner then I will not be positive THOMAS LISNEY I live at Crickle wood which is near Kilburn and am a journeyman smith On Monday 23rd Feb about half past 3 o clock in the afternoon the prisoner came to my shop brought a pistol and asked me to unscrew the barrel of it—I did so and gave it him again—he commenced cleaning it and in cleaning the nipple he broke a worsted needle in it—he said I have b—it now —I told him I could unscrew the nipple and I did so and cleaned it—he stayed at my place till between 5 and 6—I asked him 1s for cleaning it—he said Not now I have been out of place I will give it you when I come this way again —he gave the name of Herrington—I asked him how he came to buy the pistol as he had been out of place—he said he had had it by him a long time—I fired the pistol off with powder only—this is the same pistol—I heard the same evening of Mr Veale having been shot and I described the prisoner to a policeman COURT Q Where did you get the powder from that you tried it with A The prisoner had powder and shot—I did not pot any shot in it JAMES WEBB police-sergeant S 16 On Thursday 26th Feb I was on duty at Portland-town station-house and saw the prisoner brought there in custody—I sent the sergeant that brought him to see for Mr Veale and while he was gone the prisoner spoke to me—I was writing at a desk—I did not ask him any question he spoke himself—he said Is the gentleman dead that I shot —that was the first observation he made—I said He is not —he then said If I had stopped in the country I should have done as I ought to have done but my brothers and sisters were in London in good service it is horse racing that has ruined me —I asked him if he had not lived with Mr Townsend of Newport Pagnell—he said he had and he afterwards said I think the words were I should not have done as I have done if he had paid me my wages —I said Who —he said Mr Dufaur of 23 Queen Ann-street Cavendish-square I went to him on Wednesday week and asked him to give me a trifle to pass me down into the country and he would not gives me a farthing —he afterwards said he was sure to have been caught his dress was such a conspicuous dress and he had no doubt this would be the death of his poor mother—he made these observations at intervals—with the exception of my asking him if he knew Newport Pagnell he made the statement quite voluntarily WILLIAM GROVER CARTER I am a surgeon at Manchester-terrace Kilburn On Monday evening 23rd Feb Mr Veale was brought to my surgery at a few minutes before 8 o clock—he was bleeding considerably from several wounds in the neck which were evidently the result of shot—I extracted one shot I did not extract any more because he said he was a patient of Mr Roberts of the Finchley-road and I advised him to get home and see him they were deeply seated and I did not think it right to interfere at that time—I have compared the shot I extracted with the others and I believe them to be the same—I found a small portion of paper in Mr Veale s coat collar which is charred and is evidently a portion of the loading of some fire arms—the wounds were such as would be produced by shot fired from a pistol—the wounds themselves were not serious—he was in a good state of health as far as I could judge it was the first time I had ever seen him—I extracted one shot from the back of the neck and the others were in the immediate vicinity—I did not probe them at all COURT Q Could you tell at all at that time whether any of the other shots could produce danger A It is almost impossible to say erysipelas might have followed—a shot is not fatal in the same way as a bullet is necessarily—supposing any of these shots had reached the brain it must have been attended with fatal consequences—they were quite on the lower part of the head not on the forehead at all—there were several open bleeding wound The prisoner s statement before the Magistrate was read as follows — Well your Worship I have been a gentleman s servant I lived once at Chitsley three miles off the right of Newport at the time of living there I had 300l left me by an uncle I left my situation on account of having a blood vessel broken on my lungs I came to London and was out of a situation some time I then got into the betting system in horse-racing and lost my money I then got into service with Mr Dufaur 23 Queen Ann-street—I still continued at the horse-racing and I was brought before your Worship for robbing him—I was sentenced to six months hard labour—I came out on 17th Feb and went to Mr Dufaur s office 13 South-square Grays-inn to ask him to give me a little of my money to pass me into the country and he would not give me a halfpenny of it I have a sister living at Bushey and I got a half sovereign of her which I bought the pistol with the same day that I bought it I tried it I had not money sufficient to pay for a night s lodging I then took it after I tried it to the blacksmith and he cleaned it for me he then loaded it and fired it off I went from the shop about half past 5 o clock I loaded the pistol and then came as far as Kilburn-gate to return to Bushey—I then met the gentleman beyond the four mile-stone—the gentleman then passed me I followed him at a distance of about twenty yards for a short time and then passed him and I believe I got quite out of sight—I put the cap on the pistol—I turned out of the way the gentleman then passed me—I then followed a short distance till I came to within twenty yards of the third mile stone I then fired the pistol the moment it was fired a dog passed I went on about thirty yards and the gentleman stood still I then saw some one coming up the path—I then took over the hedge and made off for fear of being detected a person passed I then made off for the gentleman again but he was got out of sight I then returned to Bushey and remained there all night next morning I started and went through Watford and made no stoppage till I came to Newport and then I was taken—I have not anything more to say Prisoner s Defence I have been in service for a considerable time my father was huntsman to his Grace the Duke of Rutland and having a bit of money left me I came to London and first I got in the hone-racing and lost it my brothers and sisters would not render me any assistance to get home I bought this pistol with the money I received from my sister I am charged now with shooting with intent to murder but it was not with intent to murder but merely to obtain a little money GUILTY on 2nd

t18520510-545  545 FELIX M GEE was indicted for feloniously shooting at Michael Collins with intent to murder him —2nd COUNT with intent to do him some grievous bodily harm MR PARRY conducted the Prosecution THOMAS WILLIAMS I live at Buckingham-place Marylebone-road Chelsea I and some others had taken a room at 27 York-street for a new society called the Westminster and Pimlico New Progressive Teetotal Society—the premises were first taken by seven of us—the prisoner was a member and one of the seven—I was not one of the seven nor was Collina—it was afterwards extended to fifty-two or fifty-three members—they were shareholders—the shares were taken up at 1l each in reference to this room—I was one of the fifty-two or fifty-three and so was Collins—on Thursday evening 10th March a general meeting was called for the purpose of arranging the affairs of the society in reference to the manner in which the prisoner had behaved in regard to the society—he had done something to displease some members—a person named Cox was connected with the society—he occupied part of the premises and was a member—there was a room about seventy feet long refreshment room &c —the prisoner had wished the society to allow him to pay the rent of the premises in his name and for it to be signed as taken for him only which was objected to by the members generally in the prisoner s presence and hearing—on the evening before this happened I was present when the agent of the landlord was sent for—the prosecutor Collins was in the chair—the landlord s agent was asked in the prisoner s presence who had taken the premises—his answer was that no one individual had been given up possession of the premises but the seven had signed the agreement and the premises had been thrown open—we came to a resolution in the prisoner s presence that the key was to be given up by the agent Mr Smithan to our treasurer Mr Gwyer who held it on behalf of the members—you have to go through a house occupied by the agent to get at the premises—the prisoner said in the presence of the meeting that I and others should not hold two meetings which we had arranged with the society to hold one of which was to be called The Trial of Sir John Barleycorn and that on the next day he should let it be seen who would hold the possession of the premises—on the next afternoon from 2 to 3 o clock I saw the prisoner on the premises fitting up a bedstead in the room where our meeting was to be held—he said nothing to me nor I to him—he had brought bedding there and a large chest—we were going to hold a committee there that evening—about a quarter to 8 I went to the room and found the door closed and barred—I knocked two or three times—the prisoner made some answer which I could not exactly understand—we asked him to let us in—he said we should not enter the premises that night—we told him plainly we wished to bold the committee meeting which had been appointed in his presence the night before—he still refused—Michael Collins and several other members were present—we broke open the door with a piece of quartering and saw the prisoner with a small pistol in his hand which he presented at me—he was about four or five yards from me—he snapped the cock but it missed fire—Collins then walked up to the door and said he thought he was acting very foolishly towards himself and a d—d rogue towards the society—the prisoner held some sharp dispute with him which I did not hear—I then heard the prisoner say that whoever entered that room would receive the contents of another pistol which he then held in his left hand and he had a cutlass in his right hand—Collins was standing at my side at the door—the prisoner made three attempts to cut Collins s arm with the cutlass as it rested on the part of the door which remained uninjured—he cut at him twice and missed him both times as Collins drew his arm away but he still continued to stand in the doorway and to speak to the prisoner—the prisoner said a second time that whoever stepped over the threshold of that door should receive the contents of the pistol—he had then got the pistol in his right hand and the cutlass in his left—he still kept for two or three moments in conversation with Collins and others who were standing on the stairs and then deliberately took up the horse pistol and fired it at Collins which shot him in the belly—he called Oh my Lord I am shot and fell but was caught by Bassett who took him away—he had not attempted to walk into the room—two policemen were on the premises some few minutes previously—the prisoner after he had shot Collins walked up and down the room singing some words about blood and France—he was not extraordinarily irritated—he again said that whoever entered should receive the contents of a pistol—we were afraid to enter and so were the police—one of the police would have entered had he not been pulled back by one of our members—inspector Moran was sent for—when he came the prisoner was still standing in the room with a pistol and cutlass —the inspector said he must surrender—he made the inspector promise that he would take charge of the things in the room belonging to him and he was taken into custody two or three minutes afterwards—after he had fired at Collins I saw by his shadow on the wall that he was reloading the horse pistol though I could not see him the passage being very narrow—only one or two can pass at a time and we were not all at the door MICHAEL COLLINS The prisoner had claimed possession of these premises in York-street and there had been disputes—on this Friday evening I broke open the panel of the door and saw the prisoner with a pistol in one hand and a cutlass in the other—I asked him to come out—I had my arm on part of the door and he said Take your arm off there or I will cut it off and he made one cut at my arm and another at my foot—I told him he had no business to take possession and told him if he was a man to come out and there was a policeman outside that would take care of him and see that no harm came to him—I did not see any pistol snapped which missed fire—the prisoner said Collins by the God that made me if you put your foot over the trussle of that door your life will pay for it —we still continued to tell him he had no right there and in a minute or two he presented the horse pistol at me and fired—I stood there as much as a quarter of an hour disputing with him but had not laid my hand on him—no one was touching him he was quite free—I fell back and was taken to the Hospital Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you say You are a d - - d rogue to the Society A No I did call him a son of a bitch—he deals in tools and things of that sort—I do not know whether he sells pistols WILLIAM MORAN police inspector I was sent for and found the prisoner standing inside the door with this pistol in bis right hand and this cutlass in his left producing them —the pistol was on full cock and he was threatening any person who came in at the door—I told him he was acting very foolishly he had shot a man who might be dead and I came to apprehend him on that charge—he said if that was what I came on he would surrender—on the table I found this horse pistol—it was loaded and I drew the charge—also this powder flask and a quantity of shot and percussion caps—he said at the station he did not intend to hurt the man the pistol went off accidentally and hurt himself in the groin Cross-examined Q Have you been to his shop A Yes since he sells tools and it is very likely he may sell such things as these COURT Q Were both pistols loaded A Yes with powder and shot—I found no other pistols but these GEORGE BRITTON HALFORD I am house surgeon of Westminster Hospital On 12th March about 10 o clock Collins was brought there bleeding from the abdomen and from the left arm produced by a large number of shots which were scattered all over his person one shot was in one of the veins of the left arm—I removed all I could here are some which I found on the floor of the ward and some came away from his bowels two or three days afterwards—some had entered deeply some are in now—I found fifty or sixty shots in him he was spotted all over like a pudding—it was a very serious wounding he was in danger of his life for at least a fortnight—I have continued to attend him ever since—he remained a month or six weeks in the Hospital he is an outpatient now—he has a good deal of irritation yet—I found some shots near the heart that is under the skin opposite to it but there were muscles and ribs to get through before the heart could be reached Cross-examined Q Can you tell from the position of the shot whether the wound was in a downward direction A I should say it must hare been level because they were all scattered regularly—the chest was the highest part I found wounded William Carrington syrup manufacturer of St Margaret s-place Westminster Jacob Lewis foreman of Carson-street

PLATT conducted the Prosecution GEORGE MASTERS policeman D 121 About two o clock in the morning of the 13th May I was standing at the corner of Tichbourne-street—sergeant Harford was near me—I saw the prisoner and another man turn the corner from out of Cambridge-square—I did not see from what place they came—they passed to the opposite side of the street—Harford came up and he and I went over to them and stopped them—Harford asked them what they had been doing at that doorway in the square—they said We have been at no doorway—Harford said You have —I saw the prisoner put his hand in the breast of his coat—Harford asked him what he had there—the prisoner took a step back—I saw something white in his hand in the air—he appeared to strike Harford and he was knocked down—he also struck at me but missed me—he then ran away—the other man ran away directly Harford was struck—when Harford got up we sprang our rattles snd a short distance off I found the prisoner in the custody of Dunlap almost momentarily—I ran after the other man but he got away—I then returned and saw the prisoner and Dunlap struggling violently on the ground—I saw him assault Dunlap by kicking him three or four times on the legs—he was secured—Harford came back after me—he was bleeding on the left side—he had a wound on the head—I afterwards saw Harford go out into the road and pick up this instrument produced it is elastic—one end of it is loaded with lead—it is covered with white leather—it is very heavy Cross-examined by MR O BRIEN Q How far had they gone from Cambridge-square when you and Harford came up A About ten or fifteen yards—I had not seen them in the square at all—when Harford came up he came behind them—they stopped and when Harford spoke to them we were facing them—he did not lay hold of the prisoner or the other nor did I—I believe the prisoner wore the coat he has on now—I do not think it was buttoned—when Harford said What have you got there he put his hand towards him—whether he touched him I could not say—I had not hold of the prisoner before he ran away—it was a drizzly wet night—I bad never seen the prisoner before to my knowledge COURT Q When they ran away in what direction did the prisoner run A Towards the Edgware-road—the place where I found him struggling with Dunlap was in that direction and about thirty yards off ROBERT DUNLAP policeman D 133 About 2 o clock in the morning in question I was in Oxford-terrace which is close by Cambridge-square—I heard a rattle spring—I saw the prisoner and another man running along Oxford-terrace—I saw him come from Porchester-street—Titchbourne-street runs into Upper Porchester-street and from there to go in the direction of Edgeware-road you have to turn to the right along Ox ford-terrace where I saw the prisoner and the other man I drew my staff—I met the other man he struck me and I fell and he got away—the prisoner had this instrument in his hand in a raised position at the time he was running—I had my staff out previously to seeing that—as he passed me he struck at me and I caught the blow on my staff and parried with my staff at the same time—I struck him on the head—this instrument flew out of his hand into the road and he fell—I took hold of him and we had a violent struggle together—I was at last enabled to spring my rattle—Masters came up to my assistance and the prisoner was taken COURT Q Did you show Harford the place where the instrument fell A I did and I saw him pick it up—Harford was without his hat and his face was covered with blood and also his cape—the prisoner was very violent all the way to the station—I asked him Why were you running —he said I heard a row and was running away from it CHARLES EDWARD HARFORD police-sergeant D 382 About 2 o clock in the morning I was passing the east end of Cambridge-square and saw the prisoner and another man come from a doorway in the square—they came towards me and turned into Upper Porchester-street—I and Masters followed them and they were stopped—I asked the prisoner what he was doing in the doorway in the square at that hour in the morning—he said he was not in the doorway—I said You were there I saw you —he then put his right hand inside the left side of his coat and held his coat with his left hand—I said What have you got there —I put my hand towards him and was immediately knocked to the ground—I could not see what it was done with—it was done instantly—here is the wound—theblow was on the side of the temple—I was confined to my bed for a week and was attended by a surgeon—when I recovered myself I saw two men on Oxford-terrace—I was bleeding very much indeed—Masters sprang his rattle and very shortly after I saw the prisoner in the custody of Dunlap—I ran after the other man and when I came back Dunlap pointed out this instrument lying in the road—it was close by where the prisoner was—there is a mark of blood upon it Cross-examined Q Did you lay hold of him at all when you came up A No I did not put my hand on the breast of his coat not at all only at first when I came up—that was before he struck me—that was not to apprehend him—I was not going to apprehend him merely to know his business at that time in the morning GEORGE WILSON I am a surgeon living with Mr Vickers in Baker-street I was called to attend Harford—I found him suffering from a wound just over the temple—it was a contused lacerated wound—the skin was broken and destroyed—such an instrument as this would produce it—it must have been done with great violence because the skin was destroyed and sloughed away—erysipelas came on for two or three days GUILTY Aged 22 — Transported for Ten Years Before Mr Justice Coleridge

SLEIGH conducted the Prosecution ELIZABETH WALLIS The prisoner is my husband—I resided with him at No 5 Pickton-street Camberwell On Friday evening 4th June between 6 and 7 o clock he came home drunk and threatened my life—I do not know what made him angry with me I never gave him any provocation—he had frequently threatened me before—I had not given him any provocation upon those occasions—in consequence of his violent conduct on this evening I left the house—I left Maria Higgs there who had heen with me all day helping me in my work—I went to No 1 a neighbour s house and staid there more than an hour—in consequence of a message which I received I went back to my own house about 9—I found my husband in the front room up stairs—I said to him I hope you will go to bed quiet —he said I think I had better or I shall go to Horsemonger-lane —he then said I don t mind going there as long as I don t go for murder —I was making the bed at this time—his words became very violent and threatening he said he would have my life and have my heart out and I ran down stairs and he after me—I did not see anything in his hand—he overtook me in the front room down stairs—there was a light on the table there but in the struggle it was knocked down and put out and we were then in the dark—I felt a prick in my arm and then a smarting as if it was cut by a knife and I heard the knife fall on the floor—that was the first blow he had struck me that evening—I cried Murder and said I was stabbed and my son who was up stairs in the back bedroom came to my assistance—he is seventeen years old—he tried to pull me away and my husband pulled him down by the hair of his head on to the floor in a minute he at last got me away and I then ran to the door—a person brought in a light from next door—I then looked at my arm and found it gashed up a little as if by a knife and it was bleeding very much—it is just above the wrist—there was a small pool of blood in the room where I was stabbed—the knife was found on the floor Prisoner I had been out from 9 o clock in the morning and when I came home my wife began abusing me and said Well you have had all this day again I hope you have had enough drink now but before that in the morning she asked me to move a tub out of the back room into the wash house and when I got it to the door I asked her where I was to put it I asked her the question three times and she gave me no answer but stood and laughed at me and that was the cause of my going out she generally treats me in that way Witness It is all false when he came in I did not speak to him any more than saying Will you have some tea Wallis MARIA HIGGS I am the wife of James Higgs and live at Camberwell I was with Mrs Wallis on Friday 4th June—the prisoner came in between 6 and 7 o clock intoxicated—his wife did not say a word to him—he immediately walked through the two rooms into the back place where she was standing at work and began abusing her calling her very bad names and said he would dash her b—brains against the wall—this went on for nearly an hour and she then went away—after some time I went to persuade her to come back—she got in the back way—the prisoner was then up stairs—I do not remember whether she went up stairs but he rushed after her into the front room where I was and a scuffle took place—I saw a knife in his band it was a small carving knife with a narrow blade—it had a point but it was blunt—this is the knife produced —I am not aware that he had been using it—I had not seen it that day—while she was away he made use of very shocking expressions and said he would break her neck when she came in—before she came back I asked him whether he would do anything to her if she came back—at first he said he would break her neck but afterwards he said he would not hurt her and told me to tell her to come home—I went and she came back—I saw the knife in the prisoner s hand before the light was put out—he had it in his right hand and his arm was raised—he had hold of his wife with the other hand and said he would have her heart out using a shocking expression—just at that moment the candle was thrown down and we were left in the dark—Mrs Wallis appeared to have her left arm up as if to defend her face—that was the arm that was wounded—the moment the light was knocked out and the scuffle took place some persons rushed into the room—Mrs Wallis called out Murder I am stabbed —I heard her cry that in the dark—a light was brought in by a person next door—I found a good quantity of blood on the floor where I had seen them standing and I found the knife lying where the blood was—there was blood on it—the police came and the prisoner was taken Prisoner I desired you to go and tell my wife to come home and I would not hurt her Witness Yes you did JOHN BUSHELL I am a surgeon living in Kennington-lane Lambeth I was called to see Mrs Wallis about 12 o clock on Saturday 5th June—I found two wounds on her left arm one on the upper part of the fore arm towards the outer side and another three or four inches above it—the lower wound was evidently done by some cutting instrument—a knife would do it—it looked as if it was a stab not a straight incision from a downright blow it went through the flesh and tore it up—this knife might have inflicted it—it must have been done by a thrust—the other wound might have been produced by the same blow but it must have been under extraordinary circumstances—they were not dangerous wounds Prisoner s Defence I came home and went up stairs into the front room and went to bed I recollect my wife coming into the room she said Wallis shall I bring the children home I said You can do as you like with that she runs up to me to the best of my recollection and drags me out of bed and then I suppose I followed her down I have no recollection of having the knife or seeing it until I saw it at the station on the Saturday there is an iron round the ironing board that my wife works at and the knob is off the door of the front room so that it has a sharp point sticking out and she might in the scuffle have knocked her arm against that or the ironing board

s-park—I did not know the prisoner was at the public house—I went there to have half a pint of beer—I did not expect to find him there—he went to that house sometimes but very seldom—I swear I did not

public house—I went and told them to leave the ticket for my clothes—I found him at one public house and he took me to another—he was not so tipsy when he got home as not to know everything he said—he had been drinking but was not tipsy—I had had beer for my dinner and had some rum with him and part of some beer—I felt that it was dangerous to take any more when he talked about half and half—I said

the second floor of 11 Devonshire-place and found the door fastened on the inside by this piece of wood produced being placed above the latch—I called to White to open the door—I received no answer—I called a second time and threatened to break the door in which I did and found the prisoner lying on the edge of the bed undressed and bleeding from a wound in the throat—he said I did not think she would have done this to me —he directed my attention to where I should find a razor—I found this razor produced covered with blood and the handle broken it seems to have been twisted—the blade is not broken Cross-examined Q Was it a common drop latch A Yes this piece of wood must have been put in by some person JOHANNA M CORMICK I live at 11 Devonshire-place Broadway in the same house with the

long and divided some of the muscles and tendons which will prevent her using her hand for a length of time and will quite cripple her—those on the face were deep but did not go through the lip and she had another deep wound on the arm—I think the wounds on the arm were received while putting her hand up to defend her throat from being cut—I saw the prisoner s wound—it was about two inches long—the trachea was not divided at all—no large vessel had been cut but he had lost a good deal of blood—I should say it had been inflicted by himself because it was cut on the left side and the point where the razor would go in was considerably deeper—it was such a wound as is commonly inflicted by a right handed person cutting his throat Cross-examined Q All wounds there are attended with some danger A Yes he remained at the hospital nearly a month GUILTY on 3rd Count Aged 63 — Transported for Twelve Years Before Mr Justice Talfourd

the Prosecution JAMES WILLIAM DOWSE I am a labourer and live at 3 Paul-street Portman-market On Wednesday night 18th Aug I was at Marylebone Theatre with a friend John Place—we left at about twenty minutes to 10 o clock and went to the Champion public house about 150 yards off—when we got to the public house I saw the prisoners there—I had seen them about there frequently before—I had known them by sight about two years—I recognized them at the Champion as persons with whom I was acquainted—Sheen asked me if I was going to stand any beer—I stood some of which he partook and Palmer and my friend—we remained there five or ten minutes and then me Place and Sheen returned to the theatre leaving Palmer sitting in the public house—we all three returned to the public house in about three quarters of an hour and found Palmer there—we had some beer and all four remained five or ten minutes and then Place Sheen and me went back to the theatre—we remained there about an hour and a half when we three left together and went again to the Champion—Palmer was still there—we remained about ten minutes and then me and Place left to go home—Sheen came out with us as well—I do not know what became of Palmer we left him in the public house—it was about ten minutes to 1 when we left—we all three went up Salisbury-street in which street the Champion is—Sheen left us in Salisbury-street and me and Place went up Little Church-street which is a continuation of Salisbury-street—when we had got a short distance Sheen returned and asked me if I was coming—I do not know what he meant by that—I and Place continued along Church-street and Sheen returned a second time and said the same—I parted from Place at the corner of Exeter-street and Little Church-street and he went down Exeter-street and I turned back in Little Church-street towards my home—I had been going away from home before—I saw Sheen at the corner of Exeter-street and Little Church-street—I was on one side and they were on the other—Sheen did not follow me—he caught hold of me as soon as I turned round—he was about five or six yards from me when I first saw him after I had left Place—he came right in front of me and put both his hands in my neckcloth—I fell on my back on the ground from the effect of his strangling me and while I was on the ground I saw Palmer—I had seen them both together shortly before at the corner of Little Exeter-street—Palmer was about five or six yards off when Sheen assaulted me—while I was on the ground Palmer took my purse and money out of my right hand trousers pocket—it was a leather purse and contained 10s in gold a 5s -piece 2s and two duplicates—while Palmer took my purse out Sheen was holding me down by the neck—they then ran away—I got up walked into Earl-street and there met Clark the policeman and returned with him into Church-street to the Sailor public house where we found Sheen in the road and I gave him into custody—there was a horse and chaise there Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q Was not Sheen holding the horse A I cannot say about that—I think he was standing by its head—I suppose he was minding the horse—I am not in the habit of frequenting this public house—I had been there once before this night—this was the first time I had ever drunk with Sheen—Place is not here to-day—there was no one else drinking with us—there was no other man or woman talking to us—I swear there was no woman talking to us at the Champion—I had been to the theatre before I went the first time to the Champion which was at about twenty minutes to 10—we went to the theatre at about half past six and first left when the first piece was over about half past 9 I suppose—I stayed in the theatre from half past 6 till half past nine without coming out—I had not been to any public house before going to the theatre—there was no disturbance in the theatre between me and a person there—there was no row in which I took part neither me nor my friend—when we got back at first the curtain had been drawn up and the performance was going on—we did not find that some persons had taken what we called our seat—we had no altercation with any person there about the seat we had left—we stayed at the public house about five minutes the first time—we had some gin—there was no woman there drinking gin with us—this is the first time I have ever appeared in a court of justice either as witness or in any other character—I swear that—I have been here as a witness once before not in any other character—I swear I have not been tried for any offence—I never had anything to do with a robbery on the Great Western Railway—I was never tried for it—I swear that—this robbery took place somewhere about 1 in the morning—the second visit to the public house was about three quarters of an hour after the first past 11—the performance was over at about half past twelve—we had some beer at the second visit to the public house—nothing else and nothing at all the third time—I only took a drop of beer on each of those occasions—I did not drink anything to make me at all intoxicated—I was not intoxicated—I was as sober as I am now—I live at my father s house 3 Paul-street Portman-market—I had not parted from my friend a moment when Sheen came up to me—I cannot say whether my friend was out of sight—I did not scream out the moment I was throttled I could not—Sheen s fist completely prevented me from screaming—it is dark at the corner where I parted from my friend—there is no lamp there—I had gone a step or two when I was assaulted—there was no lamp where I was assaulted—all the time Palmer was rifling my pockets Sheen was holding me violently down throttling me—this happened about 1 and we had left the Champion at about half past 12—I did not look at the clock when I left the Champion—I imagine it was half past twelve from the time I stopped in there and the time I came out of the theatre—I saw Hobbs the policeman about fire minutes after the occurrence—if any one says I was drunk or even fresh it is false Palmer Q When you first came into the Champion who came in with you A Place no one else came—Clancey or his wife did not come—when I gave my evidence at the office I said there was a crown piece in the purse—I did not swear there were two half crowns—a person named Flaxan was not with me—I have known you by sight by your being about there for two or three years JAMES CLARK policeman 268 I was on duty on Thursday morning 19th Aug About 1 o clock the prosecutor came to me in Earl-street Lisson-grove which is sixty or seventy yards from Little Church-street—he was not drunk but he had been drinking—he was very much excited I should say the excitement was from illusage—he showed me his neck and there were red marks on it as if from pressure—he was crying—he made a complaint to me and I went with him to the Sailor public house near where I saw Sheen holding a horse and chaise—I laid hold of him and asked the prosecutor if he was either of the men that had ill used him—he said Yes that is the man that laid hold of me while Buss Palmer picked my pocket —I took him into custody and gave him to another constable while I called the prosecutor who was looking in the public house to see if he could see either of the prisoners—I took him to the station—he was very violent all the way and I had to put handcuffs on him Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q I believe there was no money found on him A No I had him in custody before the prosecutor knew it—I then gave him to another constable called the prosecutor out and asked him if he was one of the men—the prosecutor was rather fresh but he was sober—his appearance rendered it manifest that he had been drinking MR CAARTEEN Q How came you to take Sheen before the prosecutor saw him A From the description the prosecutor had given me of him PETER HOBBS policeman D 261 On Friday 20th about half past 1 o clock I took Palmer into custody in Great York-mews and told him I wanted him for robbing a man at the corner of Little Church-street in Exeter-street Lisson-grove—he said So help me God I am innocent I know nothing about it WILLIAM MARKS I am a horsekeeper and live at 25 Little Church-street On Wednesday 18th Aug I was in Little Church-street all the evening waiting for Mr Harwood coming from the play to take his chaise away—about 20 minutes to 1 o clock as near as I can say I saw the prisoners and another person who I have not seen since in Little Church-street—they were all three walking abreast up the street towards Exeter-street—I saw a scuffle between the prisoners and some one else inside against the post I cannot say who it was with and two or three minutes after Dowse the prosecutor came down and fell at our feet—Clements my fellow servant was with me—we were nineteen or twenty yards from where the scuffle was—Dowse was sober—his eyeballs were ready to start out of his head when he fell down and a person said Let him lie he is drunk and four or five minutes after he got up and said I am not drunk I have been robbed of 17s —I had known the prisoners I suppose three or four months by going to the public house to have a pint of beer after my work and have seen them there—after the scuffle the prisoners disappeared in a very mysterious manner—I could not see which way they did go—I went up to see which way they did go—I am rather lame and cannot go so fast as some people—I cannot say whether they ran or not—I walked towards the spot but could see nothing of them Cross-examined Q Do I understand you saw the prisoners and some other persons scuffling together A Yes it did not last above two or three minutes—I did not see whether any of them fell down—I was about twenty yards off—I stood looking at the scuffle I thought it was a lark—Dowse was in the scuffle because we could see him come away from there—I never saw him before—I could not tell that he was the person they were scuffling with—he came from that direction and in about two minutes or a minute and a half after the parties disappeared—it happened right at the corner—I consider Dowse was perfectly sober—he did not manifest that he was at all fresh RICHARD CLEMENTS I am a horsekeeper and live at 30 Sandford-street Marylebone On the night in question about 10 minutes or a quarter to 1 o clock I was in Church-street with the last witness—I was putting the horse to the chaise and saw the two prisoners and another party with them going up the street—I did not know the third person—they went towards Exeter-street—I saw a scuffle take place between them I thought they were larking with each other—I could not see whether the party they were scuffling with was the same person who had passed—after the scuffle the two prisoners walked away—I can say they are the persons but I cannot say who the person was they were scuffling with—I saw the prosecutor come staggering along the wall and he fell at my feet as I was putting the horse to—he came from the direction of the struggle—I did not see what became of the third man—Dowse was between fifteen and sixteen yards off when I first saw him—when I first saw him he was near the place where the scuffle took place—he came to me from that direction—he came struggling along by my mate s stable door and fell down at my feet and his eyes seemed bolting out of his head—he was perfectly sober—he made a complaint to me—he afterwards went crying down Church-street—I saw Sheen in custody in about ten minutes—I had known the prisoners before Palmer ever since Christmas twelvemonths and Sheen very nearly a year Palmer was further charged with having been before convicted JOHN CUTTING policeman B 235 I produce a certificate read John Palmer convicted at Clerkenwell of larceny in May 1847 Confined six

and said Why you foolish fellow you don t suppose for a moment that he has seen her without one —he began abusing me and calling me names and I said to him Jem I won t have that noise there I want to get up early to go to my work —he still kept calling me names and I got a little bit out of temper—I said I won t have that noise there I shall come downstairs and see if I can t alter it he replied

drover s stick has a little bit of iron at the end of it—it is such a stick as is commonly seen in Smithfield—it is only a nail at the end—I drove it in myself—this is not the first quarrel I have had

with a beating nothing of the sort Q Did your wife jump out of bed and say For God s sake Fred what do you want to beat my child for to-night A She was not in bed—she might have said that I do not

of window to see what was the matter and saw the prosecutor s wife in the court in her nightclothes—she was crying Murder —I saw the prisoner and prosecutor wrestling with a stick—that continued some few minutes—the stick was then thrown on one side and the prisoner left the prosecutor—I could not see whether he had anything in his hand or whether he had done anything to the prosecutor—the mother fetched the prisoner back—he was running round the corner as if he was going away—I believe the prosecutor bad not been stabbed then—the mother brought him back—she then went indoors and looked out of

away—my mother pulled me back and gave me a clout of the ear because she thought I should get stabbed—I did not get the knife I never saw it afterwards—I saw the blood on the ground Cross-examined Q You were not examined before the Magistrate I suppose A Yes I was the first time I was not bound over—I have been subpoenaed—my mother was out on this night—I was at home when I heard the screams and

not seem to be running away from the prosecutor—I did not see his mother fetch him back—I saw him run round the corner and Allen ran after him—he did not go round the corner he stopped and staggered

some time—Allen had him by his two wrists—I saw a stick I do not know who had it I saw it drop from between them and it was after the prisoner had run round the corner—I did not see anything done with the stick—I think Allen had the stick when the prisoner ran round the corner and the prisoner had the knife—I saw the knife—I did not see Allen raise the stick as if he was going to strike—he had it in his hand before the prisoner came up to him and then they began to struggle I did not see Allen raise the stick at all—I did not see what he did with it—the prisoner laid hold of it when they began to struggle—I think one was trying to take it from the other and then I saw the stab—as Allen held the prisoner s wrists he made a swing and stabbed him—that was after the stick had fallen they

o clock as near as could be—I told him be had better go—he then buttoned up his coat rose up out of the chair and then unbuttoning his coat he said I forgot the change —I said If you are not particular I do not want to part with it because it is all I have meaning that the change would be more acceptable than the sovereign—he said I am not particular —I then took it up and put it into my own pocket—he put his hands into his two waistcoat pockets and feeling said I have dropped my sovereign —I stooped to look for it and the prisoner immediately seized on my head with his left hand and squeezed my head down on the carpet he held it down put out the candle and drawed a razor across my throat—I could not see the razor at the time—it was something sharp like a razor—I threw him off and pushed the razor from my neck and said George George if you are doing this for money tell me and you shall have money —he said Then give it me then give it me still seizing my head—he would not let me get up—he took hold of my head again between his legs or his feet and tried to put the razor to my neck again—I put up my hand and prevented it—the blade was in my hand and I broke the razor as I held the blade in my hand—I did not see the handle till the policeman showed it to roe—I escaped through the prisoner s legs as he was holding me by the head and lolling himself over my back to keep roe down—I tried to get away he seized on me again and held me by the neck so that I could not speak—I forced one of his hands from my neck and he took the other away and held my dress behind—I was trying to go to the window—he put his hand behind him and reached my poker it was in the fireplace close by where he bad been sitting—as I was raising my arm to open the shutters he struck me a violent blow across my shoulder—he then pushed me against the bed and hammered my head with the poker until I got possession of the poker myself—I begged of him several times to spare my life for the sake of my children—he tried to take the poker away from me but he did not succeed—I then tried to get to the door as we were holding the poker—he put his back against the door—we had a severe struggle to see which would get the poker but we both kept hold of it—I asked him why he had been using me in the manner he had—he said he had parted from his master and his father had forbade him the house—I then asked him what I should give him to go and not hit me any more—he said 10s and light the candle —I bled very much from my throat and hand—I was wearing a piece of velvet tape round my neck which the policeman has and I was wearing this brooch at the throat and the razor cut across the brooch and cut the velvet—when the prisoner said 10s and light the candle I said I will give you the 10s if you will go with me up to the front door —he said You will halloo —I said I will not light the candle as you put the candle out you may light it he then put his arm round me and kissed me and said My dear aunt we will go together and light the candle —we had a little more conversation but I cannot call it to mind it was all of the same nature—he said he was sorry and said Give me a knife and I will cut my own head off —I talked to him for several minutes—he dropped the poker into my hand and turned from the door—I threw the door open and ran up to the front door and gave the alarm the gentleman from No 135 and the cook from the next door No 132 came down—the policeman came down about three minutes after—the prisoner was then sitting on the bed—I went to him and talked to him but he would not answer me—I told the policeman where he had attacked me—he lighted the candle and the gentleman and the cook also brought in lights and the policeman picked up the handle of the razor—I said I don t know whether it was a knife or a razor it was very sharp —the policeman said Here is the handle of the razor —I said I threw the blade somewhere I don t know where and he looked in the fireplace and found it there—I then gave him the poker and the piece of velvet—I was afterwards attended by a surgeon—it was a fortnight before I was out of my room—I was six months gone in the family way at the time—no sovereign was found—the policeman searched in my presence Cross-examined by MR COOPER Q You are his aunt by marriage A Yes I have been married to his uncle nine years—I never gave the prisoner an angry word in my life he has always been the same towards me always affectionate and kind he always appeared partial to me—after all this had taken place he put his arms round my neck and kissed me and said My dear aunt —I had not seen anything in his manner lately that struck me—he was kind to me up to the moment this happened—the change lay on the table full half an hour—it was a half sovereign and 10s in silver—this occurred in the front kitchen—I wished him to go but he would not—he stayed there while I gave the alarm and brought the people down—before this he was telling me several things of our own family affairs it was all true—he did not speak after he said Give it me give it me till he set his back against the door and I talked to him—he did not speak during the struggle—he did not appear stupefied—he appeared very strong and very spiteful—I had never seen him so before—I was very much frightened ALFRED WELSBY policeman B 55 My attention was called to the house No 133 Sloane-street on this night at a quarter past 10 o clock—I found the door open—I went down stairs and saw the prisoner sitting on the bed and the prosecutrix having hold of his hands—I saw the blood running down from her bead and I saw two severe wounds on her head—I asked her in his presence what he had been doing—she told me he had been trying to cut her throat with a razor which she had broken out of his hands and thrown on one side—I found the razor-blade near the fireplace and the handle in the middle of the room—she told me that he had asked her for change for a sovereign and that he had said he had dropped the sovereign that she took the candle to look for it and he immediately seized on her flung his arms round her and with the razor tried to cut her throat—he heard all this—her hands were cut and bleeding—I produce a piece of velvet which is cut through—I took the prisone into custody—he said he was mad—he said at the station house that he did it through want for he was starving Cross-examined Q How did be appear when you went in A He seemed very much excited and trembling—he was sitting on the bed and his aunt in front of him holding his hands—he did not appear at all eager to go MRS BATES re-examined This is the piece of velvet which was round my neck WHITMORE I am a surgeon living at 124 Sloane-street I was called in to see the prosecutrix—I found her sitting on a chair—I found a superficial wound on the neck and a number of smaller incisions but none of any importance none that required me to attend to them more than once—I found two wounds on the head they were deep cut to the bone—I also found a little wound on the cheek and others on the right hand and a number of smaller abrasions or scratches on the palm of the hand—the wounds on the head were very severe they must have been done with a blunt instrument such as a poker from the fact that the hair was not divided it was split it seemed as if the scalp had been split by the weight of the weapon—she was quite conscious but agitated and exhausted—this was perhaps half an hour after the attack—there was not much blood running at the time but I think judging from the blood that had coagulated she had lost a good deal—the piece of velvet round her neck would in some measure blunt the edge of the instrument—the injuries on the head and cheek were decidedly inflicted by a sharp instrument—she was threatened with premature labour—I consider her quite well now—she had occasion to keep her bed for about a fortnight—during that time I cannot say she was ever in great danger not in any immediate danger but there was the chance of premature labour coming on Cross-examined Q What was the depth of the wound A Barely through the skin—if it was done with great violence the velvet would not have prevented it the brooch would—I have seen some cases of madness—I have read Beck s Medical Jurisprudence and Dr Taylor and Dr Conolly s works—there are generally premonitory symptoms of insanity—there have been cases of persons all at once being seized with paroxysms—I never heard of Miss Lamb s case—I should be inclined to think a person mad who all at once without any motive cut the throat of another to whom he was previously always affectionate and kind it would be a strong symptom of insanity—that would be what is called homicidal insanity MR PLATT Q But surely you do not mean to say that the mere violence and ferocity of an act would lead you to say it was an act of insanity A Not necessarily so certainly JURY to MRS BATES Q Did the prisoner bring the razor with him or was it found on the premises A He brought it with him GUILTY on 2nd Count Aged 20 — Transported for Seven Years

some grievous bodily harm MR RIBTON conducted the Prosecution FRANCES YATES I live at York-cottage Kensall-road The prisoner is my husband—we have been married twenty-six years but we have not been living comfortably together for the last six years as he has not been employed in mind or business and has been intemperate in his habits—he has used threats to me several times—about Christmas last he asked me for some money and words arose from that at the time and he had a pistol in his breast from 7 o clock all the evening I went down stairs and was afraid to go down again and I stopped till one of the women fetched my son home and then I opened the prisoner s coat and showed my son the pistol and told him that his father had got it there to blow out my brains—the prisoner told me that if I did not get out of the way or something of that kind be would blow my brains out but it is some time ago and I do not wish to say anything but what I can call to mind—on Wednesday May 25th I returned home between 9 and 10 o clock in the evening and found my husband moving the mattrass that I had taken from his feather bed because be had told me the day before that I must look d—d sharp if I had a chance to take care of myself and I was afraid to sleep with him—he was taking away the mattrass which I had put for my own bed to make up his bed and I said John how can you expect I can do my work if you will not let me have my bed —he said There is your bed come to it and I said No so long as you use such expressions to me I never can come to your bed —I then went down stairs into the back washhouse—I was coming out of the washhouse with a candle in my hand and he was coming down stairs I saw something like a pistol buttoned under his coat as he came down—I went into the parlour where Mrs Pusey and Ruth were and made a communication to Mrs Pusey—I then sent Ruth to fetch a jog out of the kitchen and then went to draw some beer at a little cupboard under the stairs I heard the

away and Mrs Walker came in and released me—at the time the pistol was presented at me I heard the snap of the flint but saw no fire—my hand was cut with the flint in two places as I got hold of the pistol close up to the lock—it was the same pistol which he had before he had had it some time—I believe he was sober—I ran for protection into a neighbour s house Prisoner There is a combination of false witnesses against me MART ANN PUSEY I live with Mrs Yates and attend to the laundry for her—I have been there about two months On 25th May I was in the parlour between 9 and 10 o clock and heard

to keep it down which I did—he tried to get it from me—he got his wife by the throat with his left hand—Mrs Walker then came in and took the prisoner s hand from his wife s throat and she ran out at the front door—the prisoner asked which way she was gone and I said Out the back way oh purpose to deceive him Prisoner Q Did not you and Mrs Yates both distinctly state before the Magistrate that I never spoke a word A I never heard you speak during the struggle—I should say the affair lasted more than ten minutes till the policeman came it was a very hard struggle RUTH SYMES I have lived with Mrs Yates about three months up to the present time and have heard Mr Yates and her quarrelling—when I had been there about three weeks I was sleeping underneath the room they slept in and heard something rattling overhead and loud speaking between Mr and Mrs Yates—I went to the bedroom and said Is anything the matter Is any one ill —Mr Yates said No but Mrs Yates said Something is the matter and pushed open the door and I saw Mr Yates standing with a stick in his hand—as I was standing in the landing I beard him say that if she left the room she should leave it a corpse—on Wednesday evening 25th May I went into the other room to get a jug for Mrs Yates and saw the prisoner standing there with his elbows on the mantelpiece and a pistol in his breast he had his hand on it it was under his coat but I could not see the handle of it—when he saw me go in the room he removed his hand from his pocket—I brought the jug to Mrs Yates and went into the parlour and after some time I heard the snap of a pistol I am sure of that—I then heard Mrs Yates say Oh Mrs Pusey he is shooting me —I went into the passage to see what it was and Mrs Pusey went down—I saw them struggling and opened the street door and went for a policeman—when I returned the prisoner was in custody Prisoner Q You say you saw the pistol in my waistcoat I have not had a waistcoat on for these three months

ashamed to get such a crowd about your door because if you are not I am for you —he said I will not be humbugged with her —he went towards the kitchen door with a pistol in his hand he examined it

CLERK conducted the Prosecution THOMAS GOLDS WORTHY I was a seaman on board the Queen of the Teign I shipped at Sunderland At Singapore there were a number of Lascars shipped on board—the two prisoners were part of the Lascar crew—I think there were sixteen or seventeen Lascars on board altogether when we left Singapore and there were nine English on board—I recollect the evening of 22nd July very well—we were then out in the open sea—the captain s watch terminated at 12 o clock at midnight—the mate s watch began at 12 o clock—William Treat was the mate—I was in his watch—Robert Mills was also In that watch—there were three Englishmen altogether and five Lascars—Ahalt was one that was in that watch—a man that we called the tindal was another Awang and Lartan and Hamet they were the five Lascars—during the commencement of the mate s watch I was at the wheel—while I was there my attention was attracted by something on deck I did not know what it was—I saw the blacks going about the deck to and fro and looking under the boat—I did not hear anything said that attracted my attention—the first thing I observed was two of the Lascars the tindal and a man called Awang came up and attacked me and the mate—I had not observed that anything had passed between the tindal and the mate or Awang and the mate before they attacked him—I had not said or done anything to the tindal or Awang—at the time that the tindal and Awang made the attack I did not see either of the prisoners—the tindal and Awang attacked me and the mate with daggers or Malay kreeses—after I was attacked in this manner I ran into the cabin and gave the alarm—these are the sort of daggers I saw that night produced —I never saw the Lascars wear these upon them till that night—when I went into the cabin and gave the alarm the captain came on deck—I did not come with him I ran into the steerage and gave the alarm there I rattled the door and sung out for the Englishmen I sung out u Murder —the Englishmen came on deck they were up before me—when I came on deck I saw there was a great deal of fighting going on—the men were attacking the mate—the mate was very nearly killed—the tindal and Awang were two that were fighting with the mate—I did my best towards it I lent a band to knock them down if I had not done it you would not see me here now—when I came on deck the captain and Northalt and the mate and the second mate Cummings were being attacked by the Lascars—I am sure I could not mention the names of the persons who attacked them they were the blacks—I saw they had kreeses and iron bars in their hands—I did not see either of the prisoners at that time—I was armed with cutlasses when I came up again on deck—four of the Lascars were killed that night and Cree jumped overboard—the tindal was one that was killed and Awang Draman and Seden—none of them were any of my watch that night but the tindal and Awang—after I came on deck and cut down some of these men with the cutlass the Lascars ran forward and went down into the forecastle—the Lascars were afterwards lashed to the rigging—I believe all were lashed except the boatswain and the steward and a Chinaman—the two prisoners were part of those who were lashed—they were kept in that state till we got to Gibraltar—I did not see either of the prisoners do anything on the night of 22nd July—they had done all their deeds before I came on deck Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH There were sixteen Lascars shipped at Singapore Do you mean that those sixteen persons all spoke the same language A I cannot tell you that they were persons that belonged to different parts of the country—these men were lashed to the rigging and they were kept there exposed to the weather till we got to Gibraltar WILLIAM BURFORD TREAT I was chief mate on board the Queen of the Teign I believe we shipped fifteen Lascars at Singapore and one Chinaman and we had nine English—on the night of 22nd July I was at my watch from 12 till 4 o clock—the captain s watch had turned in—about 1 o clock I was sitting abreast the wheel aft on the starboard side—in the course of my watch I had not observed anything unusual—there were men there who were not on the watch—it was unusual for men who are not on the watch to remain on deck—I saw two or three of the watch below on deck—men who ought to have been in bed—they were moving about—I saw nothing particular done by either of them before the attack was made on myself—the prisoner Ahalt was on my watch—he was one who was on deck I could not swear to the other prisoner being there—I first heard Goldswortby call to me Look out sir there are some men coming here —I looked and saw Cree coming on one side of me and the tindal on the other side—the tindal had a kreese in his hand—I could see it—Cree came aft and when he came abreast of me he raised an iron bar which he had with both his hands and made a blow at me—I jumped up and received the blow on my back—I think it took me on the loins—I jumped inside the man s arms and took him by the shirt—I carried him off the poop which is about three feet high and threw him down on deck—while I was struggling with John Cree trying to get the bar away from him Awang came up he made a blow with a kreese which went through my coat and waistcoat but did not touch the skin—it was a stab—he made a second attempt a second stab I saw it coming—I let go John Cree and received the blow of the kreese on my arm—I seized Awang s hand with my left hand and held him and while I was holding him the tindal stabbed me several times—the stab once entered my belly and five or six other Lascars were on me at the same time with knives and bars—as near as I can recollect as I was in such a state of excitement the captain was the first man who came to my assistance—he took the kreese out of Awang s hand—he took the blade out of the handle—I received three blows in the body one in the arm and several in the back—the wound in the back is quite well the one in the belly is very dangerous—I have an abscess now in my back—I became disabled I was carried below and laid I think a fortnight I could not get out of bed at all—I think the captain did not assist me down I was in that state almost fainting that I hardly knew who was there—the first thing I saw was the Sevang s wife she brought me to—I think she had been using brandy—I had fainted I could not tell whether the fighting continued after I was below—I know Ahalt was in my watch that night—I did not see him near me at the time I was being attacked Cross-examined Q After you left Singapore and previous to this unfortunate occurrence had there not been a serious altercation between the boat-swain s mate and several of the Lascar crew A I believe there had Sir between the serang and the tindal—the serang was a black—I never knew that part of the Lascars took the part of the serang and the Others took the part of the other side—they appeared to be very comfortable in general MR BODKIN Q Had the English party anything to do with it A No it was amongst the Lascars in their own language—it was all talk ROBERT MILLS I was a seaman on board the Queen of the Teign I was in the mate s watch on 22nd July last—I remember two bells striking that was 1 o clock—Goldsworthy was at the wheel at that time—I observed the Lascars who were on the watch on deck—just before the two bells struck 1 saw Kishner on deck he was not on the watch—he went to the cask to get some water—about half an hour after I was sitting down with my hands in my pockets between the winch and the midships near the long boat and a man knocked me down with an iron bar that was the first thing I noticed—the man who knocked me down was Seden—he was not on the watch he was the cook of the Lascars—it was not usual for him to be on deck at that time—he had a right to be below from 8 o clock at night till 4 o clock in the morning—I got up and be knocked me down again he knocked me down three times and when I got up the third time Alie stabbed me in the jacket with a knife—it did not touch my flesh—I saw a knife in his hand—I do not know what became of it but I know he had a sheath knife in his hand—I grabbed a piece of wood out of the long boat to defend myself—I made the best of my way aft—there were five after me and they had iron bars and sticks in their hands—I could not recognise any of them only the two that strnck me first they were Seden and Alie—when I got to the back of the poop a man shoved me down against the rail that was Ahalt—he jumped off the poop and got hold of the stick that I bad in my right hand—I hauled it away from him—he let go and I fell on my back against the topsail brace and he stabbed me in my left foot with a knife he gave me three stabs in my left foot when I had my back against the brace—at that time the chief mate was on the starboard side and some of the Lascars were round him—at the time Ahalt stabbed me in the foot there were no other Lascars round me the others bad left me just between the poop and the mainmast—I should say it was half a minute from the time that Alie cut my jacket with the knife till Ahalt stabbed me in the foot—Alie was not on my watch he had been on the watch up to 12 o clock the first watch—he belonged to the captain watch—I do not know where Alie was at the time that Ahalt stabbed me in the foot—the mate was on the starboard side I was on the larboard side on my back on the poop against the topsail brace when I was stabbed—when I got up again from the poop I jumped down in the cabin—as I was going down in the cabin the captain was coming up—I did not see the second mate till they were all lashed Cross-examined Q This 1 o clock was in the night A Yes about half past 1 o clock—it was not blowing hard it was a very light wind—we had no light on board except that in the binnacle—at the time of the commencement of this violence on me I was sitting between the winch and the midships just astern the long boat—I did not see Treat the mate at that time—the poop was three feet or two feet and a half above the deck WILLIAM TAPLING STOOKE I was master of the Teign I am related to the owners—I had a general cargo on board chiefly consisting of sugar and pepper—I shipped sixteen Lascars at Singapore—on the night this occurred my watch had turned in at 12 o clock I generally turn in a little before 12 o clock—I was disturbed about half past 1 o clock—I went on deck and saw the chief mate and the Lascars straggling—there were about four or five Lascars as well at I could see it was moonlight but cloudy and dark at times—one of the Lascars who was engaged with the mate had a kreese in his hand—I could not see whether the others had any weapons—the mate appeared to be wounded he was crying out saying he was stabbed to the heart—he was leaning against the side of the vessel—I interfered—I seized the kreese in the Lascar s hand and drew the blade out of the handle—the mate was carried below—I saw his wounds afterwards and dressed them—he was seriously hurt so much so that I thought he would have died—Awang was one of the men that were about the one I took the kreese from I could not swear to any of the others—I did not notice either of the prisoners that night—I should say I continued on deck about ten minutes—I then went below to dress the mate s wounds—I returned to the deck in about ten minutes there was no fighting going on then it was all over—while I was down dressing the mate s wounds I heard the noise of scuffling and fighting going on and when I came up I found four of these men lying dead Q Did you at any time have any conversation with either of these men as to what caused this A Yes Ahalt told me without my asking him—I could not say when but be told me repeatedly at different times that they intended to murder the English to take the ship and take her to California and that David Fair fold was going to navigate the ship—Fairfold was one of my crew—I had occasion to disrate Fairfold during the voyage sometime previous to this—he had been an able seamen and I bad sent him forward—he messed by himself but I sent him forward with the Lascars—he slept in the same part of the ship with the Lascars by way of punishment—at the time there was this disturbance on deck and there was an alarm which caused the English sailors to come on deck to render assistance Fairfold did not come with them he remained below till it was all over—I did not notice the prisoners do anything in the course of that night—I cannot say that they were on deck Cross-examined Q I believe some of the Lascars were men of very bad character A I heard so—I did not know before that one of them had been engaged in a mutiny on board another vessel—I believe the tindal attempted to murder the Sevang s wife during the voyage on board the vessel Q You had conversation with Ahalt through what medium was it A I speak their language a little myself and be speaks broken English—he did not say that that portion of the crew who were killed or thrown over-hoard had that mutinous and piratical design and he himself had not—I do not perfectly understand Malay ADAM CUMMINGS I was second mate on board the Queen of the Teign I was in the captain s watch and was below when this disturbance began—I came up on deck in consequence of being alarmed—as I was going up I got a blow on my head with a stick or bar of iron I could not say which—it was Alie that struck me—when I got on deck I saw the mate and three of the Lascars struggling together—when Alie struck me he was sixteen or twenty feet from where the mate and the other Lascars were—I did not see Mills or Ahalt The Captain stated that during the voyage he had had the means of observing the general conduct of the prisoners and they were well conducted quiet offensive men ALIE— GUILTY Aged 24 AHALT— GUILTY Aged 39 Recommended to mercy by the Jury on the supposition of their ignorance of

t18540130-263  263 WILLIAM ENTWISTLE WILLIS feloniously stabbing cutting and wounding Mary Willis with intent to murder her 2nd COUNT with intent to do her grievous bodily harm MR PLATT conducted the Prosecution MARY WILLIS I am the prisoner s wife and live at No 5 Lee s-buildings Chancery-lane he is a law writer On Christmas eve last I went to bed about half past 12 o clock at night my husband had gone to bed about 9 o clock or half past—he slept in a different bed and in a different room to me—we have been living very unhappily for a long time—about half past 2 o clock in the morning he came to my bedside and awoke me saying Poll I am so cold —I said to him Why come to me if you are so cold —he came into bed to me—he said those words as he came in and I made that reply—the minute I said that he stabbed me with the carving knife— I felt myself stabbed—the knife went through my ear and cut my neck—I bled a good deal—I called out to Mr Hyatt who lives in the first floor I lived in the second floor and begged of him to come up to me that my husband had stabbed me I was still lying in bed when I called out—my husband never spoke to me again—he walked into his own room and left the door open—when I felt this cut at the back of the ear I put up my hand to save my throat and the knife went through my little finger and very nearly cut it off—it was after I was stabbed in the ear that I put up my hand to save my throat—I only received one blow—he had gone into his own room before Mr Hyatt came to me—he went into his own room as soon as he stabbed me—I was still in bed when Mr Hyatt came into the room—he brought a light with him I was bleeding very much indeed—Mr Jones the surgeon was sent for—my husband and I have not had quarrels before this—I had not been on good terms with him that week he called me very bad names Q Have you been living separately from him for any time A It was his wish that he should sleep with the two boys and me with my two daughters for we had no other convenience—I have been obliged to support myself and family for some weeks COURT Q How many children have you A I have five living by the prisoner I have had six—I have been his wife twenty-two years—my eldest daughter was gone to Islington to spend Christmas eve she was not at home at this time—I had nobody in bed with me—my other daughter is in the Welsh school in Gray s Inn-road—my husband did not sleep with the two boys the two boys slept on a mattress on the floor in the same room with him—he slept by himself MR PLATT Q Look at this knife one produced by the policeman do you know it A Yes that is the knife—it was kept in the table drawer in the room where my husband slept COURT Q You did not see the knife that he used A No I had no candle—my daughter found it afterwards in the bedclothes—I did not see it found Prisoner Q Before the Magistrate you said you had been out to a day s work is that the case A Yes I had been out ever since the first thing in the morning about half past 6 or from that to 7 o clock—I was at Mrs Peters s No 2 Tanfield-court Temple—I left Mrs Peters s about half past 9 o clock in the evening I then came home—you were undressing yourself going to bed and you began abusing me and calling me bad names I begged of you to go to bed I did not want anything to say to you for you had struck me that same week and nearly broke my arm—I went out again—I was to have gone out to work on Christmas day and I went out to tell the gentleman I should not be able to come as my eldest daughter was not at home—that gentleman works at No 3 Tanfield-court—he is a married man—he asked me to come and wash up some plates and dishes—his name is Rabbin—he is a clerk in the Temple—I only went to tell him that I was not able to come to work on Christmas day—I tried to get a person to go in my place but I could not because I wished to be at home with my family—I had not passed Mr Rabbin s in coming home from Mrs Peters s—I did not know where he lived it was somewhere in Holborn I was to go and give him an answer and then he would give me directions where to go next morning—I came home after having been to Mr Rabbin s—I did not go out any more that evening—I think I returned home from Mr Rabbin s about 11 o clock—I had to go to Mrs Watts who recommended me to Mr Rabbin—I have worked for her fifteen years—I remained at home after that and my boy and I had supper together and then I went to bed—I had had nothing to drink but a little porter I certainly had a glass of gin given me that was all—Mrs Watts gave me that—that was all I drank while I was out—I had a glass of gin and some porter—Mrs Watts did not give me the porter—I had a half pint of porter with my boy that was before I went home—I met him in Chancery-lane as he was coming home from his work he is about eighteen years old—I had nothing more to drink—I had about a pint of porter with my son that was at a public house at the bottom of Chancery-lane—I did not go to Mr Bailey s after that—I had no beer with my supper I had some broth for my supper my son and I had a bason of broth together—I certainly was not drunk that night—I will swear that I did not say to my son Billy I am so ill put me to bed —my boy brought me a light and lighted me to bed I never said anything of the kind—I did not go out to market that night COURT Q Was the son who had supper with you the same son that gave you the porter A Yes he lives in the house he had a very little of the pint of beer we only had one pint between us MR PLATT Q Is there any ground whatever for his complaining of you for being unfaithful to him A Not at all I am as innocent as the babe unborn—I have been faithful to him THOMAS HYATT I lodge in the same house as the prisoner and his wife On Christmas morning last I was awoke between 1 and 2 o clock in the morning by hearing some person cry out it was Mrs Willis s voice—my name was called out loudly—I put on my small clothes and went directly to her room I found her in bed leaning over the bed and bleeding very much from a wound in the ear and neck and likewise a cut on the hand there was a great deal of blood about—there was no one else in the room—from something Mrs Willis told me I afterwards went into the other room where I found the prisoner on the bed wrapped up in the clothes—I asked him what he had been doing and why he did it—he said if she was not dead his hand must have been nervous—on looking more closely at him I found that he had cut his own throat or partly so there was a great deal of blood all down his dress and on his shirt—my son went into the room with me and when I found the state they were in I sent him for a police officer and likewise for a medical man he very soon came back with both—I stopped in the room where the prisoner was till he returned—I did not say anything further to him nor did he to me—these parties have lived in this house about five years they have quarrelled a great deal at times and very frequently—it appears that the prisoner had been drinking in the afternoon part of this day but I did not see him—I believe him to have been in a sober state Prisoner Q You say I said if my wife was not dead my hand was nervous did you tell the police Magistrate so A Yes I did WILLIAM CHERRYMAN policeman F 153 On the morning of Christmas day a little before 2 o clock I was called by a son of last witness to go to the back room second floor of this house—I there found Mrs Willis in bed she was undressed—I saw a great deal of blood about the floor and found her wounded—I then went into the front room where I found the prisoner sitting up in the bed and the front of his shirt all saturated with blood—his throat was cut two ways—I got him out of bed and found this razor producing it in the bed just under where he was lying—it was lying open and there were marks of blood on it which are on it now—I asked him what he had been doing he said he was sorry that he had not done it effectually—Mr Jones dressed his wounds and he was taken to the hospital—I had seen the prisoner about an hour and a half before this happened going towards his house—I considered him drunk at that time COURT Q About what o clock was that A I should say a little after 12 o clock between 12 and 1 o clock—he was going home Q Just repeat the question that you put to him and his answer A I asked him what he had been doing and he said he was only sorry he had not done it effectually MARY ANN WILLIS I am a daughter of the prisoner and live with my mother I was out at a party at a friend s on the night in question—I returned home about half past 8 o clock in the morning on Christmas day—I found my mother in bed bleeding—I got her out of bed and on removing her I found this carving knife in the bed—it was always kept in a table drawer in the same room where my father slept—I am turned twenty years of age WALTER JONES I am a surgeon and live at No 27 Fetter-lane I was called to see Mrs Willis about 2 o clock on the morning of 25th Dec —I found her lying in bed her dress covered with blood—I found a wound in the lobe of the left ear—it was a punctured wound it had passed right through the ear and wounded the side of the neck just at the angle of the jaw—there was a cut on one of the fingers it was not a very bad out it seemed as if a portion of the skin had been sliced off as it were but it was not very deep—this knife would be a likely instrument to do it—it was not found that night—I was shown ft razor that was found in the next room and I did not think that could have done it—I went into the front room where the prisoner was he wag sitting on the side of the bed bleeding very much from a wound in the neck—it was a jagged wound and appeared as if it had been cut from right to left and from left to right both ways—he had lost a great deal of blood—the wounds were superficial not very deep—the wound upon the prosecutrix was not a dangerous one as it was—it was in the neighbourhood of the carotid artery about a quarter of an inch or so but it might be influenced by the position of the neck—that is a very dangerous position for a wound Prisoner s Defence My wife states in her evidence that at half past 9 o clock I was undressing myself and going to bed and that she was at home at 11 o clock the policeman says that he saw me going home at past 12 o clock at night the worse for liquor which Mr Hyatt says I was not now if I was in bed at half past 9 o clock how could I be going home drunk at past 12 one or the other must be wrong I shall leave myself entirely in the bands of the Court and say no more I am completely sold I have no money and not a soul has been to see me so that I could not possibly get witnesses otherwise I could have brought forward witnesses to prove very grave things against my wife GUILTY on 2nd Count Aged 61 — Transported for Life 
t18540403-466  466 JAMES TUCKER was again indicted for feloniously shooting at George William Umpleby with intent to murder him —2nd COUNT with intent to do him grievious bodily harm MR BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution GEORGE WILLIAM UMPLEBY I am a woollen draper at No 118 Holborn-hill The prisoner was in my employment—he left me in Jan —on Tuesday 7th March I gave him into custody on a charge of embezzlement—he was taken to the station-house in Smithfield—I went there also—I was on horseback at the time and I rode to the station—I there made the charge —the officer was told to search the prisoner—at that time I was standing with my back to the prisoner—I heard a report and distinctly felt a ball pass over my head or I suppose it was the current from the ball but it went so sharp that I felt the pain from it for half an hour afterwards—I thought it had taken the skin off my head but it had not it left no mark whatever—I immediately turned round and saw the prisoner staring with the greatest possible astonishment to see that I had not dropped—I found that the ball had passed through the window immediately behind me lower than my head—I was surprised how it could have got over my head without having hit it but he stood a little higher than I was—the ball struck the wainscoting and penetrated to the extent of about an inch the wainscoting being firm against the wall caused the ball to rebound—the prisoner was secured by the officer and I saw a pistol in the officer s hands Prisoner Q What time in the evening was it when you first saw me A About a quarter after 7 o clock—you were coming in the direction of Shoreditch—I first spoke to you in a court—I was on horseback—I rode into the court—there was just room for my horse to turn round in the court—you were so disguised that I was not quite certain whether you were the man or not—I put my head under your bonnet to look—if you had had presence of mind to get away you could have done so—I believe you were sober—I had not seen you I should think for about a fortnight before 7th March—I believe I had finished giving the charge of embezzlement against you at the time this occurred—I said at the station that it was very fortunate you did not attempt to shoot me while I was on horseback—I am not aware that I said I was surprised you did not—I would not be certain there was a good deal of conversation passed it is impossible to recollect the precise words—when you were in the court you were wishing to shun me—you were stooping with your head down and had one of the felt hats drawn completely over your face I had to put my head completely under it to know whether it was you or not—I was examining every individual I met for I thought you might be in woman s clothes or disguised in any way crawling out about that time of night I was looking for you—I think the inspector said to you at the station You dastardly villain what have I done to offend you or something to that effect and you replied I did not mean it for you I meant it for him meaning me—I distinctly heard you say that—I think I said before the Magistrate that I did not distinctly remember it but I recollected afterwards most distinctly your saying it HENRY JOHN TEAGUE City police inspector I recollect the prisoner being brought to Smithfield station on Tuesday 7th March—he was charged by Mr Umpleby with embezzlement—I was entering the charge and my head was close to Mr Umpleby s while I was doing it—just as I was putting down the amount 8l I felt the bullet pass my head—it did not touch my head I felt the sensation of its passing me—Mr Umpleby was standing by the side of me and it passed from the back of his head to the front of mine—I was a little behind him leaning to the desk—I turned round and saw this pistol produced in the prisoner s hand—he was in the dock at the time—that is higher than the place where I was standing—I went into the dock and threw the prisoner down and another constable picked up the pistol—I traced where the ball had gone through the window and into the moulding—I have brought the bullet and the moulding too—after the prisoner was fully secured I asked him why he wanted to injure me—I think I said What did you want to fire at me for —he said I did not intend it for you I intended it for him looking at Mr Umpleby—I examined the pistol at the time it had been recently fired Prisoner Q Was it not in the cell that we had this conversation A Not when the remark was first made—you repeated it afterwards to the same effect I cannot recollect the exact words—after you had been secured and had risen from the ground Mr Umpleby said I wonder you had not fired at me when I was on horseback or rather it was more addressed to me than to you—I remember saying in the cell that I was glad it was no worse both for your sake as well as mine—you made no reply—you were lying down in the cell composing yourself very comfortably—I do not recollect your saying you were glad it was no worse—it is possible you may have said so I do not remember it but I dare say we were both of us glad it was no worse—you were sober at the time you were brought to the station—Mr Umpleby stood about eight feet from you—I placed you in the cell about 9 o clock and placed a man with you till the morning JOHN THORPE policeman G 193 I took the prisoner into custody between 7 and 8 o clock on this evening—I took him in a cab to the station—I was there desired by the inspector to search him—I turned round to do so and saw him pull his right hand from his pocket and point something in the direction of the prosecutor and Mr Teague—I did not at first see what it was—I saw the flash and heard the explosion and then I saw the pistol in his hand—he threw it down on the floor and he was secured—I took up the pistol and gave it to the inspector Prisoner Q Whereabouts was I standing at the time you took me A In Shoreditch—Mr Umpleby was close by the side of you—he was on horseback—you made no attempt to escape—I cannot say whether you might have escaped before you were given in charge—I did not see what it was in your hand at first—I saw you take something from your pocket and point it in the direction of the prosecutor and Mr Teague—it was done so instantaneously—I saw the explosion and heard the report and then I saw the pistol—I think perhaps you had had a little to drink you were not drunk—you said nothing to me about intending it for Mr Umpleby—you had no opportunity of making any resistance when I secured you after the pistol was fired SUSAN MARSHALL I am housekeeper at the Smithfield station I was in the passage when the pistol went off and heard Mr Umpleby calling for the police—I went into the charge room and the prisoner was then down on the ground with the inspector and two officers holding him—I then went to the mess room for assistance—when I returned the prisoner was standing up and he was laughing when I went in—I told him there was nothing to laugh at to take a man s life away—he then said I did not intend it for that gentleman it was the other —there were but Mr Umpleby and Mr Teague in the office at the time—he looked towards them they were standing together I could not possibly say which Prisoner Q What distance were you standing from me at the time A Close to you—I do not think it possible that I could make a mistake—I heard you say to inspector Teague at the cell door I did not intend it for you —there might be twenty policemen there or more after police was called THOMAS PRIOR I am a cab driver and live at No 9 Angel-court Strand I drove the prisoner to the Smithfield station—next morning I found two bullet moulds a tin case with some bullets in it some nipples and a large clasped knife—these are them produced Prisoner Q What time was It when you found these things A Next morning about 11 o clock—that was after I heard of the explosion of the pistol—it is my duty to return things found in my cab—I did not find any till—I went to Newgate to see if I could identify you—I could not do so because you had not got your hat on that was the reason MR BALLANTINE Q Was there an officer in the cab with him A Yes RICHARD DAVIS I am a locksmith and general dealer in Henrietta-street Manchester-square I know the prisoner—on Tuesday 7th March I gold him this pistol—it had no nipple on it then—he asked me if I had anything more and asked for a bullet mould—he said he was going to Australia JOHN STEVENS I sold the prisoner the nipples for the pistol on 7th March Prisoners Defence On 7th March I had been down to Lower East Smithfield and on returning home I was walking up the Kingsland-road I happened to turn round and saw Mr Umpleby on horseback and to avoid him I walked up this turning that he terms a court he came up to me and said What are you doing here I have been looking for you for some time I want to have some conversation with you I said Very well he said Where can you got I then condescended to walk with him I suppose pretty well a quarter of a mile or nearly so till we saw a policeman he called him and gave me in charge we went to the police station at Smithfield the charge was entered the policeman was desired to search me I had the pistol now produced in my pocket and when the officer was told to search me I pulled it out of my pocket in a hurry to lay it down and it exploded the inspector called out Police murder and sent for assistance and I should think not less than twenty policemen came in most of them with their jackets off and each of them took a very active part or tried to do so in searching me I had a pair of gaiters on at the time and they were trying to take my boots off without taking my gaiters off I could not help smiling at the time I was told to stand on my legs that accounts for Mrs Marshall saying I was laughing I might have smiled for I could not help smiling to see so many able bodied men trying to get my boots off without taking my gaiters off they searched me and found some money on me and they locked me up about an hour after I was locked up in the cell inspector Teague came in and said Now you seem a little more cool than you were a short time back is there anything you want and he said to the housekeeper who was standing outside Let the prisoner have anything he wants any refreshment or anything of the sort and pretended to make me very comfortable he sent up stairs for a mattrass to lie upon which I thought was very kind of him he rubbed his hands and said I don t know whether you meant this for me but you gave me very short notice this conversation took place in the cell I have no recollection of any other I said It is not likely I intended it for you neither did I intend it for Mr Umpleby it is not likely if I had intended it for Mr Umpleby that I should have said so to inspector Teague Mrs Marshall hearing Mr Teagues statement at Guildhall as a matter of course states the same thing it is natural having bought the pistol the same morning that I saw Mr Umpleby it does not appear at all probable that I bought it for the purpose of shooting him with it if I had intended to take his life I should have been prepared weeks before or days before at all events having bought the bullet mould for the purpose of making bullets it does not appear very much like intending it for one particular purpose my object was to have left London I intended to take the pistol with me the knife I had had in my possession for a long time and generally carried it with me GUILTY on 2nd count Aged 37 — Transported for Life MR BALLANTINE stated that the prisoner had been previously convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to eight months imprisonment that Mr Umpleby had nevertheless consented to employ him that he might redeem his character and that he very shortly commenced with him a series of embezzlements 
t18540612-763  763 JAMES THOMPSON feloniously cutting and wounding Susan Searle upon the head with intent to murder her 2nd COUNT with intent to do grievous bodily harm MR BROWN conducted the Prosecution SUSAN SEARLE I am the wife of John Searle and live in Church-street West Ham The prisoner is my brother—I remember seeing him on 31st May—prior to that time I had been on bad terms with him but I cannot say for what cause he owes me some ill will but I cannot say for why—I saw him opposite my house that day for a long time but I would not take any heed of him—I went down stairs to let my lodger in and when I opened the door he drew his van which he was in close to the door and made a strike at me with the whip—he made use of a very vile expression and said he would cut my guts out and hang them round my neck—I shut the door and then he exclaimed that he had come to mill the glaze—I suppose that was to break the windows—I ran out of my house the back way and went in to Mrs Reeves the house next door but one to mine—I did that because I was afraid of him and I had no one at home to protect me—Mrs Reeves was standing by her door I was standing by the side of her talking to her and before I could hardly see where I was the prisoner came up to me and struck me a blow on the left side of the head with his clenched fist—he made use of a very vile expression and said he would do for me—he called me a b—y w—e—that was not the expression that he had used before—Mrs Reeves told him that he was no man to come into her house to insult his sister and he should not do so—he said he would strike her also—he struck at me again—he then took a hammer off the counter and struck me with it on the head in two places one blow inflicted a very large wound—I bled a great deal—Mrs Reeves and her boy then endeavoured to shove him out—they got him out and we shut the door —he said that he would throw the hammer through the window—I asked the little boy to go and fetch his father or a policeman—he opened the door and went out and the prisoner flew in grasped me by the throat and inflicted this other wound on my head with the hammer—I remember nothing more after that—I defended myself after I got the first blow from the hammer with a piece of iron hoop I struck at him but I cannot say where I struck him—I cannot say whether I did strike him for my face was covered with blood and my hair was all in disorder—I believe I did hit him but I cannot say where—I cannot tell how many times he struck me after he got me by the throat—I remember receiving that blow and I remember nothing more—after I came to myself I was very weak I was then in my own house—it was just before Mr Williams the surgeon came he attended to me—the prisoner was very much the worse for drink Prisoner The blow I received from her broke a tooth out of my head and cut my lip right through I inflicted no blow with a hammer Witness I am positive that he struck me twice with the hammer—the piece of iron hoop I picked up off the floor in Mrs Reeves s house—I had not said anything to the prisoner before he drove up to the side of the door Prisoner She called me a murderer and said I had murdered my mother Witness I did Dot—he said he would murder me and I said If you do it is no more than what you tried to do —I do not believe he did murder his mother and I never imputed it to him SARAH REEVES I am the wife of Edwin Reeves and live in Church-street West Ham On 31st May I saw the prisoner in his van fronting his sister s door—he was abusing her very much—she lived two doors from me—she came the back way to my house—that was directly after I had seen him abusing her—she was standing at the door talking to me and he came and hit her in the face with his clenched fist saying my twelve months is up now and I will have my revenge of you if possible —I said If you come over my board I will give you in charge to the police —he put his foot over the board after he had hit her and took the hammer off the counter—I got him out and shut the door—he did not strike her then—he said if I did not let him come in he would throw the hammer through the window—I then opened the door and sent my son out to look for a policeman and while he was gone the prisoner came over and hit his sister on the temple with the hammer—she flew round the counter and he after her—he seized her by the throat and hit her again with the hammer on the top of the head—this is the hammer produced —there is blood on it now—it is my husband s hammer—she fell down down senseless—she bled very much—he then went out of the house Prisoner Q Did you see me pick up the hammer A Yes off the counter when I pushed you in the chest Prisoner I took it out of my-sister s hand and she cut her head against your stairs Witness She never had it in her hand COURT Q Did you see her take up the piece of iron hoop A Yes it was close to where she was standing—she used it as well as she could against him but she had no power—I did not see his lip cut and do not know how it was done SUSAN SEARLE re-examined I had made a charge against my brother before—he broke my windows and then attacked me in a savage manner and he was bound over to keep the peace for twelve months—I believe that is about fifteen months ago WILLIAM HENRY WILLIAMS I am a surgeon at West Ham On 31st May I was called in to attend Mrs Searle I found her in a partial state of insensibility evidently suffering from loss of blood—she had two wounds on her head one on the left side just above the forehead and one on the side near the vertex of the skull—the one on the left side was not of so severe a nature as the other it was a lacerated wound evidently inflicted by a blunt instrument—the point of this hammer would inflict such a wound—the wound on the right side was more severe it cut through the whole of the integuments and denuded the bone of its covering it must have been done with very great force—when I first saw her she was recovering from concussion of the brain—they were such wounds as would endanger life she might have had inflammation following—I am attending her at the present time I considered her in danger for nine or ten days WILLIAM SPEARING policeman K 18 I apprehended the prisoner on the morning of 1st June—I found him at work in the Barking-road—I told him he was charged with seriously assaulting his sister Susan Searle—he said Yes that s right I should have killed her had not that woman interfered I shall do it now some day for she aggravates me to it —I asked him where the hammer was and he sent his boy to the stable and gave it up to me—this is it I have had it ever since—I took him to the station Prisoner s Defence Wherever I go to get my living she is always annoying me and every time I pass her door she speaks falsely this day she came out and abused me as I sat in the van I would not get out for a long while this is not the first or the second time that she has committed assaults upon me there has scarcely been a day since I was bound over but she had hooted at me in the street calling me a murderer and all sorts of things which greatly aggravated me and a parcel of strangers passing at the time my mother was found drowned on the shore near Bromley and had been lying there for three weeks so that many persons might suppose there was something in it she has been a bad one

t18540814-911  911 JOHN BANBURY feloniously wounding Grace Banbury with intent to murder her 2nd COUNT with intent to do her grievous bodily harm MR THOMPSON conducted the Prosecution GRACE BANBURY I am the prisoner s wife we have been married about fourteen or fifteen years Five months ago he turned me out of doors and I went to live at No 6 Dove-street until five weeks ago when I went to live in Market-street—on Saturday 22nd July I was sweeping at the shop door when the prisoner passed he called me an old b—and a w—and said What do you want of me —I said I want nothing of you but to keep at a distance —he then made the best of his way up and fired a pistol at me—I did not see the pistol before he fired it the contents hit me—I was shot in the arm and in the gum and a good deal of blood came—I found the blood gurgling in my throat I went to spit it out and I saw the blood streaming on my dress coming from my arm—I was hit in the arm because I put up my arm when he fired I do not know bow I came to do that—I have been under medical treatment ever since—there had been no quarrel between me and my husband that day I never spoke to him but twice during the time I was absent from home—I had seen him several times on this Saturday—once when he passed the first time in the morning he looked at me very bitterly but did not speak to me—the next time he passed me he called me a w—and an old b— that was not the time he shot me and he passed me once afterwards—as I came up the market he ran up against me and knocked my shoulder but did not knock me down—that was about 11 o clock—I do not know what o clock it was when he had the pistol Prisoner She has got a boy twenty-five years of age that she had by a soldier in Exeter barracks and that boy is at home along with me he will not do any work he will be out all night long and come in about daylight in the morning and lay abed all day and she has got a girl twenty-two years of age that she had by her first husband and this girl is out three or four nights of a week and has had men in my house I have called out at 2 or 3 o clock in the morning to know whether they were going to bed and the answer has been Go to h— you old b— I told her they should go away I would have no such rigs in my house she said If they go away I will go too and she has left me ever since her son has knocked me about the head several times and every time he meets me he knocks me about her daughter has set a mob of persons at me and called me all the names she could this woman has annoyed me every time I have been outside my door and has been to everybody that I have any dealings with so that I should not get any employment Witness It is quite false what the prisoner says—I have a boy twenty-five years old it is not true that he will not work—he has worked for the prisoner at bricklaying and has only got 6d 1s or 18d a week all last winter—my daughter has not had men in the house and made disturbances—she is here—I can bring those forward who have lived twelve months in the house to say that no man has ever been in my house—the reason my husband turned me out of doors was because my daughter who was in place as a laundress came home to wait on me when I was ill—she lived with me five months—he said to me You had better go out of doors while all is well or else it is certain death for you I have got other arms besides them I have got two loaded pistols Prisoner On the Saturday when this happened I had not much to do and I went about the fields shooting birds to pass an hour or two I passed by her door and she was at the door she called me all the rogues and vagabonds she could she had got a large stump brush in her hand and tried to knock me with it several times I fired off the pistol at the brush to frighten her so that she should not knock me with it Witness It is quite false—I had a brush sweeping the door but I did not strike him with it—I did not blackguard him at all MARIA BRADLEY I am a single woman and live at No 5 Richard-street East Poplar On Saturday 22nd July I was in conversation with the prosecutrix at her own door—I saw the prisoner coming from his own house—he had a pint pot and a pistol—I saw him take the pistol from his waistcoat pocket with one hand and put it into the other—he called Mrs Banbury an old b—and an old w——she had not said anything to him before he called her those names—she had a broom in her hand—she did not attempt to strike him with it—besides calling her those names he asked her what she wanted with him she said Nothing but go away and mind your own business —he then fired the pistol and shot her and she fell—I saw him cock the pistol the hammer was down on the cock and he lifted it up—I saw the prosecutrix bleeding in the mouth and in the arm—I did not see the prisoner come out of his own house—he was on the opposite side of the way when I first saw him a few yards from me—nothing passed between the prosecutrix and prisoner but what I have stated Prisoner Q Were you not coming out of your house when I went into my house A No I was not—I saw you cock the pistol—you had the pistol in your left hand—the prosecutrix did not hold up the broom and knock you—you had the pint pot in the same hand as the pistol RONALD ROBERTSON I am a surgeon of Montague-place Poplar I was called in to attend the prosecutrix on Saturday 22nd July about 4 or 5 o clock—she was lying on the bed bleeding from a wound in the left arm close to the elbow joint—it was a circular wound about an inch in depth and about half an inch in diameter—I think it was principally the wadding that had penetrated—she was likewise bleeding from the mouth there was a small wound on the left cheek from a single shot—I extracted two small pellets—I do not think there are any shots remaining in the cheek—there are a great many remaining in the arm—both the wounds were calculated to endanger life JOSEPH TUCK policeman K 339 I took the prisoner into custody on Saturday 22nd July—I told him that he had shot his wife and I should have to take him to the station—he replied that his wife s son was always ill-using him—he said nothing else—I produce a pistol—I found him concealed behind the bed curtains with the pistol in his right hand pointed towards me it was loaded with powder and shot and a cap was on it but it was not on the cock the hammer was down on the cock—I examined a door near where this occurrence took place and I found several shot in the door—I produce several shots which the inspector took from the pistol in my presence when he unloaded it MR ROBERTSON re-examined I have one of the shots that I extracted from the prosecutrix—it is of the same size as these Prisoner I have nothing more to say than I have said GUILTY on 2nd Count Aged 33

conducted the prosecution JOHN RIDGER City policeman 216 About a quarter-past 7 o clock on the morning of 21st Sept I was in the neighbourhood of Cock-court Snow-hill—I heard cries of murder—I went up the court I saw Ellen Marney come out of the house No 10 where the prisoner lives—she was covered with blood—she was taken by my direction to St Bartholomew s Hospital—I returned to the house No 10—I went in the parlour on the ground floor—I saw the prisoner sitting on the bed undressed—there were three children in the room one about nine years old one seven and one four I believe—I asked the prisoner who had committed the injuries on the woman—he said I did it —I told him to dress and I took him to the station—I searched him but found nothing on him—I returned to the house and searched but found no knife or any weapon—in consequence of information I went the next day and searched the place again—I found on the staircase this knife it was on the last stair leading from the parlour into the cellar—it was partly closed and quite wet with what appeared to me to be blood Cross-examined by MR TALFOURD SALTER Q How far was it you took the woman A I merely took hold of her she went down the court—I did not see who she went with—it was scarcely five minutes from the time I first saw her till I entered the house—the room is on the ground floor leading into the passage—the door was open and through that door I went into the room where I found the prisoner—there was no appearance of beer pots or signs of drinking—there were some wine glasses on the table—there might have been matters in the room which contained liquor—there was nothing in the cellar—there is a staircase out of the parlour into the cellar—the prisoner was very much agitated at the time—he looked to me to be sober CHARLES PIERCY City policeman 10 On the morning of the 21st I met the woman bleeding from a wound in the throat—she was 30 or 40 yards from the prisoner s house—I took her to the hospital—I went to the house—I found a hole in the floor which went down into the cellar—I saw the prisoner at the station—he was cautioned and asked what he did it with—he said I did it with a pocket knife I don t know where it is ELLEN MARNEY I have been living with the prisoner as his wife for the last twelve months—on Friday 21st Sept I was with him in our room in Cock-court there were the children in the room his children by his first wife—I asked him if he was going to give me the money that he promised to give me to go to market—he made me no answer—he was undressed I was dressed—my mother came to the door about half-past 6 o clock—he would not let me open the door—I asked him what was the reason he would not let me open the door to let my mother in—he said I am undressed —I said it was not the first time she had seen him undressed—he said Let your mother go away I will give you the money —I told my mother to go away and said I would meet her in Farringdon Market—she did go—the prisoner then got up and went to my box and sat down for a few minutes on the box—he took two dirty dresses off my box and threw them on the floor—he said You have been talking a long time about going you had better go now gather up your things —I asked him if that was what he meant—he said Yes —I said I had very little going to what I had coming I brought more things to you than I am taking away —I went to pick them up to put them where there were some more dirty things and as I stooped he drew a knife across my throat—I did not see the knife in his possession—I did not see any more till I saw the stream of blood and I cried Murder —I tried to get away—I ran towards the door but the door was locked—he then began stabbing me about the head and shoulders and gave me very severe wounds in my head with his fist but he stabbed me with a knife in two places on my shoulder one on my temple and another under the ear and one on my thumb—from the effects of these blows and wounds I dropped and thought I was dead but I was sensible afterwards—as soon as I dropped he ran into the cellar—I afterwards got up as well as I could and got to the door—he bad the key that locked the door in his pocket but it happened that I had a key—I opened the door and met the policeman—I was taken to the hospital—on previous occasions the prisoner had used language towards me of a violent character—he called me very bad names the night before this happened and said he would do for me if I was to leave him—I haw threatened to leave him and he said he would do for me—he has several times threatened me within the last three or four months—I remained in the hospital a month last Friday Cross-examined Q I am afraid the prisoner has been in the habit of getting intoxicated A No he has not—I never did see him out of the way much—he used to have a little—it was not usually on those occasions that he used this language—I recollect what I was doing the night before this—I went to bed about 11 o clock—he was with me then—I had not been out all day—I had been at my mother s about 9 o clock—my mother had called—the prisoner was with me at my mother s—we were on very good terms EDWARD MORRIS I am house surgeon at St Bartholomew s Hospital On Friday morning 21st Sept I found the last witness in the surgery—I examined her and found a wound five inches and a half in length extending from the left side of the neck at the lower part obliquely across the front of the neck towards the right ear—it was an incised wound—it was superficial in the first part of its course—at the right side of the neck it had cut the muscles about half an inch—I found another incised wound nearly dividing the skin but very superficial another wound behind the left ear about an inch long merely dividing the skin two other incised wounds on the left shoulder another wound on the left temple another an inch and a half long on the left thumb—all these were incised wounds—in my judgment this knife is an instrument with which they could have been inflicted—here is blood on the knife now—I found other injuries on her person—there were severe wounds about the left eye a laceration on the lobe of the left ear—the lobe of the ear was torn and the ring which goes through the lobe of the ear to suspend the earring was broken—I did not consider that her life was in danger GUILTY on the 2nd Count Aged

t18560303-323  323 WILLIAM GRIFFITHS feloniously wounding Alfred Mills on the head and causing him a bodily injury dangerous to his life with intent to murder him —2nd COUNT for wounding with intent to murder —3rd COUNT with intent to do grievous bodily harm MESSRS BODKIN and CLERK conducted the Prosecution ALFRED MILLS I am a warder in Millbank prison I was so in Jan last The prisoner was a convict confined there as a prisoner—he was one of the penal class undergoing hard labour—on the morning of 12th Jan it was my duty to escort him with some other prisoners to the treadwheel at half past 9 o clock—there were fifteen prisoners going at that time—they marched in single file—the prisoner was in the rear about the last man—I and other warders walked by the side of the file as an escort to accompany the men—I was in the rear of the whole file—Underwood the principal warder followed us to close the gates between the different wards—after we had marched about half a dozen paces the prisoner turned round and struck me a violent blow on the back part of the head—I could not see the instrument that he made use of—I saw it afterwards—it was an iron ring attached to some hammock nettles—it cut my head very much and caused the blood to flow and rendered me almost insensible so that I scarcely knew what I was doing—I remained standing upright—as soon as I came to my recollection I saw him in contact with warder Beer—they were struggling with each other—at the time he struck me he was the last man of the file—I will not be positive whether he had changed his place or not but he was the last man when we marched off—he was secured in the passage with the assistance of some of the other prisoners—he was very violent—four other prisoners assisted in securing him—I had not spoken one word to him that morning nor had he to me—in the previous week I had made two reports against him once on the Monday and once on the Thursday—on the Monday it was for making use of threatening language towards me saying he would do something for me if I did not mind what I was doing—I was then in the act of searching him which was my duty as he was going to his cell—the second report on the Thursday was for making use of insubordinate language when working at the treadmill—he said he wished that he could break the treadmill he would do the best he could towards it and said that the governing directors were trying to punish the penal class prisoners as much as lay in their power and that they might as well shut them up and clam them to death as keep them in the way they were doing—he has been in Millbank about three months Prisoner Q Did not I ask to see the governor four times A You asked to see the governor and your name was entered in the book—I did not abuse and assault you when you asked to see the governor—I did not assault and pull you about on 13th March nor at any time MR CLERK Q When he desired to see the governor was his name put down in the ordinary course A His name was entered in the warder s report book EDWARD BEER I am one of the warders in Millbank Prison On 12th Jan I accompanied the penal class who were going to work at the treadmill—I was the third officer from the front the prisoner was in the rear of me when he marched off—as we were going towards the treadmill my attention was drawn to a noise in the rear—I turned round and saw the prisoner striking violently at warder Mills with a hammock ring attached to some hammock nettles—he held the rope part in his hand and had a piece round his wrist—I did not see where he struck Mills I saw him striking at him violently several times—I left the other fourteen prisoners and rushed to Mills s assistance and the prisoner immediately commenced an attack upon me—he struck at me several times and once struck me on the left side of the head—I closed with him and threw him and caught hold of the ring in my hand and he held the rope—he kicked me several times across the thighs—I found that I could not succeed in taking the ring from him myself and I called on the other prisoners to assist—this produced is a hammock ring there are two to each hammock one at each end by which the hammock is suspended—I afterwards went to the prisoner s cell and found a ring and cord missing from it Prisoner This man took a knife out of his right hand trowsers pocket and stabbed me Witness I solemnly declare I had no knife or any other sharp instrument in my possession at the time—it is false nobody struck him with a knife ROBERT UNDERWOOD I am principal warder at Millbank Prison I recollect the penal class going to work on the morning of 12th Jan —it was my duty to follow the file and close and lock the doors—I saw the prisoner turn round and strike Mills a blow at the back part of his head—I was by at the time—I did not see Beer with any knife I must have seen it if he had one—when the prisoner was secured he said he intended to murder Mills—he has been nearly three months at Millbank—before that he had been in some other convict establishment GEORGE COOK ATTFIELD I am surgeon of Millbank Prison On 12th Jan I saw Mills—he had two wounds on the back of the head one was about an inch and a half long and down to the bone—he was giddy and sick faint and half stunned—I considered that the wounds endangered his life at the time Prisoner s Defence I asked four times to see the governor about the treatment and the way the treadwheel was going and when I spoke about it this man gave me abusive language and assaulted me when he searched me I was dreadfully used at Millbank it is no use saying anything I know I must undergo the penalty of punishment but after this I shall have another trial and I will have somebody to speak in my defence about the treatment I have received if I am punished more than I have been according to the treatment I have received I mean to have another trial for what is done to me I have no witnesses here the other prisoners saw this man stab me with the knife when I was down GUILTY on the 3rd Count Aged 34 — Transported for Life Before Mr Justice Erle

Prosecution WILLIAM MIDDLETON I am a warder at the House of Correction in Coldbath-fields The prisoner was a prisoner there under my charge—he had been under my charge fox about a fortnight—on 24th Jane he complained to me of his bread being light he said his loaf of bread was small—I told him I could not help its being small if he thought proper he could have it weighed—he said he did not wish to have it weighed provided I gave it to him the same as I did to other prisoners he said that I picked out the small bread for him—I told him that I would not allow him to accuse me with that he might see the Governor upon it if he thought proper—he said he would do so—he then asked me to put the loaf in the cupboard for the Governor to see it I did so—previous to that I weighed it—the prisoner could see me do it—it weighed six ounces—the prisoners get twenty ounces a-day divided into three parts then there is ten pounds allowed the contractor in every hundred for the allowance so that the prisoners shall not have less bread than is allowed them—they do get twenty ounces a-day taking one loaf with the other—this was about half past 5 o clock in the evening—the prisoner slept in the dormitory that night—there we other prisoners there the room sleeps one hundred—on the next morning about twenty minutes to 11 o clock the prisoner was taken before the Governor with regard to this charge of the light loaf—I took the bread with me—I told the Governor in the prisoner s presence what had occurred the over night as I have stated now—on that the prisoner said that the officers had an antipathy against him—the Governor said he should not allow the prisoner to make the assertion he had done the night previous if he had anything to say he could see him and make his complaint and he should stop part of his dinner—I took the prisoner back to the yard and put the loaf in the cupboard in the day room where the men get their meals—the prisoner was by the side of me at the time—he said he bad intended to ask the Governor for the loaf—I said he might have done it if he had thought proper—nothing more passed—I took him to his work—it was in the dormitory it was his work that day to clean and sweep the dormitory and put it to rights—it was about 10 minutes to 11 o clock when I took him there—there was nobody else working there—I locked the door of the dormitory and left him there—about 20 minutes to 1 o clock I went to the dormitory again—I unlocked the door and on opening it the prisoner stood on the step of the door there are steps leading up to the dormitory and there is one step inside the doorway—the prisoner stood on that step—not a word passed between us—as soon as I opened the door the prisoner struck me just by the corner of the right eye he struck me in this way raising his Jtand and striking downwards as hard as he could force it he struck me with all his might and gave a grunt at the same time—I was going to shut the door and he gave me a second blow across the hand and cut me across the knuckles I could not see what he had in his hand it was so momentary—I locked the door he shoved against it but I had sufficient strength to push against him and lock it—I hastened down to the hall and there I saw the doctor—I had this cap on when I went to the dormitory producing some pieces of a cap —at the time he delivered the blow at my head this fell into the dormitory and afterwards he cut it up and threw it out of the window COURT Q How came you to go back to the dormitory A To see whether he had done his cleaning—it was my business to go—he knew that I should come—his regular dinner that day would have been a loaf and a pint and a half of soup—they get one loaf for each meal—the light loaf was given him over night for his evening meal—when they object to eat it it is taken away from them—he had a loaf and a pint of cocoa for his breakfast—he would have had whatever there was for dinner—I locked up the loaf because when they do not eat it the previous night it is not given to them back again it is set with the stores and served out again—if a loaf is given over night and not eaten in the morning it is taken away there and then it is contrary to the rules for a prisoner to keep it and have it at another meal—I had had no words with the prisoner before this on any occasion JURY Q Did he ever complain of short weight before A Not dur-ing the period of his being in prison COURT Q The loaves are of different weights you say A Yes—the governor is not here GEORGE HOARE I am chief warder at the House of Correction Cold-bath-fields On 25th June just before 1 o clock in consequence of what Middleton said to me I went to the dormitory—the door was locked—I looked through the inspection hole and saw the prisoner standing with his hands behind him close to the door inside—I did not speak to him—I unlocked the door and put my arms round him and said You have some-thing in your hand —he said he had—I said Give it to me —he did so and said that he did not wish to hurt me—his words were I don t wish to hurt you Mr Hoare —he gave this knife produced into my hand it was wet with blood and just in the same state as it is now with this tow round the handle—I said to him How came you to do such a thing —he I answered He may think himself a lucky fellow that was all that passed—the prisoners are not allowed to have such knives about them—the prisoner would not have such a knife when working in the dormitory—I subsequently asked the prisoner where he got it from and he said he did not wish to say it would be ascertained by-and-by COURT Q Have you had any dispute with the prisoner about the weight of the loaves or anything of that sort A None whatever—he made no resistance to me and used no violence whatever BENJAMIN MORRIS I am a sub-warder in the House of Correction I kept a box in the dormitory where the prisoner slept—it was kept locked—I had been to that box on the morning in question at half past 5 o clock—I then placed this knife in that box and locked the box—I did not go to it again until about five minutes before 6 o clock the same evening—it was then broken open and the knife was gone—I saw the knife next morning in Mr Hoare s possession—it was not then in the same state in which I had placed it in the box it had been ground at the back—it had a round point when I left it and it had been ground to a sharp point as it is now—the blade had been forced back in the handle and this hemp or tow wrapped round the handle COURT Q How many persons slept in that room A 100 or thereabouts—they generally leave the dormitory at twenty minutes to 7 o clock—the room is then empty and the door is locked—the warder in charge of the room locked it that morning in my presence—Middleton had charge of the room that morning—there is a stone step inside the door upon which the knife might be sharpened—I am not aware of its having been used for that purpose—I did not examine it—it had been cleaned WILLIAM MIDDLETON re-examined I remember going to the dormitory that morning about a quarter to 7 o clock when the prisoners left it—I locked the door after them—I found it locked when I returned—I did not examine the step to see whether it had been used BENJAMIN MORRIS re-examined I put the knife into the box at half past 5 o clock—the prisoner was at that time in bed in the room I do not know whether he was awake or asleep—his bed was from twenty to thirty yards from the box—it is a large room—he could see the box from his bed I do not know whether he did—the box was by my side we are not allowed to leave our post I merely put the knife in and locked the box—I do not sleep in the room I am on duty on the watch I had been using the knife for a meal during the night—I usually kept it there and used it daily GEORGE HOARE re-examined I cannot say whether the prisoner had slept in this dormitory all the time he has been in custody—he was only under Middleton s charge a fortnight—he had been in the prison three months—we have 1 400 prisoners and only 900 cells HENRY WAKEFIELD I am surgeon of the House of Correction On the morning of 25th June I saw Middleton he was bleeding profusely from an incised wound in the forehead on the angle of the orbit on the right side it went to the bone it was barely a quarter of an inch deep and from three quarters of an inch to an inch in length there was also a slight wound on his hand—those wounds might have been inflicted with such a knife as this—he was under my care ten or twelve days COURT Q It was not a dangerous wound A It was not as it happened Prisoner s Defence My intention was not to murder him I was unjustly provoked in consequence of the way that he brought me before the governor—when he saw that I intended to bring the loaf before the governor and make a complaint in the usual way he then by way of spite reported me to the governor for breach of conduct and also deprived me of the loaf which I was justly entitled to on the preceding night I intended to retaliate on him but not to take his life COURT to WILLIAM MIDDLETON Q When you were before the governor did you make any complaint against him A I did for his accusation on the previous night—I believe I mentioned that before—I said I told the governor what had passed GUILTY on 2nd Count Transported for Twenty Years MR BODKIN stated that the prisoner had been three times convicted of burglary and had been twice before the Visiting Magistrates for stabbing the warders 
t18560915-876  876 JOHN COLE feloniously wounding Emily Luker with intent to murder her —2nd COUNT with intent to do grievous bodily harm MR RIBTON conducted the Prosecution STEPHEN ROBERT LONG I live at No 69 Gracechurch-street and am cashier in the service of Messrs Capper and Son linendrapers I know Howley-place Villas—I went there on 7th July last about half-past 9 o clock in the evening to deliver a parcel—I rang the bell of the garden gate—the servant Emily Luker opened it—I gave her the parcel—I saw the prisoner there he was standing at the corner of the street—he came to the gate—as soon as I had given the parcel he drew out a pistol—I seized hold of it by the barrel—he was then I think about two or three yards from the young woman—he pulled the pistol out of ray hand and I jumped on one side—he then levelled the pistol at the servant s head and fired—she fell—the prisoner walked off—I went into the house—the girl was taken into the house and I left—I did not see where she was wounded—I heard the report of the pistol Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q Did you observe the young man before you rang at the gate bell A Yes he was at the top of the street when I first saw him—I cannot tell how far off that was—I think it was longer than this Court—he was standing there—I had no opportunity of seeing his face to see whether he was in an excited state or not—I did not hear him say anything when the gate was opened by the girl GEORGE MACKERELL police sergeant A 349 On 7th July about half past 9 o clock or 25 minutes to 10 in the evening the prisoner came to the Paddington police station—the station is about four minutes sharp walking from Howley-place Villas—he knocked at the door and I admitted him—he said I am your prisoner I am come to give myself up —he repeated again I am your prisoner I have killed a person I have committed murder at the same time he showed a pistol that he had in his hand—Williams another constable took the pistol from him—I took him into the inspector s room—I asked him what he wished to say to me—he said I have killed a person or I think I have I fired the pistol and I saw them drop arid then I came straight here —I asked him if it was a man or a woman—he said A woman —I asked him if he knew her—he said yes it was Emily Luker and she lived at No 9 Howley-place Villas—he said he had tried it three times yesterday and he had told her before that he would do for her—I sent a sergeant to the house and found it as he had stated Cross-examined Q I believe he was in a very excited state when he came to the station house A He was excited WILLIAM WILLIAMS policeman D 141 I recollect the prisoner coming to the station on 7th July last—he brought this pistol from underneath his coat and gave it to me—I produce it—I examined it—it had been recently discharged it was quite warm and smelt of powder—he said that he had taken life—I searched him and found on him eight letters a small quantity of gunpowder four percussion caps and several small stones—he said he had fired off enough stones out of this to kill three—I produce the stones there are five of them—five of the letters are signed by the prosecutrix addressed to the prisoner and three are from the prisoner to her—the stones were loose in his pocket—it was after I had found the stones that he made the statement about having loaded the pistol Cross-examined Q Are those all the stones you found A I think those were all—I am not aware of any others—those were all THOMAS HASELDINE police sergeant D 10 The prisoner came to the station on the evening of 7th July—I heard him state that he had shot some one at Howley-place Villas—I went there and saw Emily Luker on a bed in the back room in a very dreadful state—the doctors then wished me to go back to see if I could find out what the pistol was loaded with—I went back to the station and said to Williams in the presence of the prisoner Do you know what the pistol was loaded with bullet or shot —the prisoner answered With small stones —I then went back to Howley-place Villas and assisted in removing the girl to the hospital—the prisoner was afterwards taken to St Mary s Hospital to have the deposition taken—on his way to the hospital lie said he was very sorry it was entirely her own fault she had not sent him an honourable letter Cross-examined Q He was in a very excited state A Oh very JAMES ROBERTSON police sergeant D 2 On the evening of 7th July I assisted in taking the prisoner to the hospital—on the way there he said he had been waiting about there on Sunday night to see if he could see the prosecutrix—he made several other remarks Cross-examined Q Did he not say he had an appointment to meet her on that Sunday evening A No—he said he thought he should see her come out but he did not say he had made any appointment with her—her—he did not say if he had met her on that Sunday he should not have been driven into the state of mind in which he was—he said nothing about an appointment with her on the Sunday evening EMILY LUKER In July last I lived at No 9 Howley-place Villas I have known the prisoner for nearly eleven months—in April last he made me an offer of marriage—I did not give him an answer to that—the acquaintance between us ceased on 18th May—he continued to call for nearly a fortnight after that I saw him several times but my fellow servant generally answered the gate—I saw him at the gate—no conversation then took place between us with regard to what had happened before—nothing was said about the offer of marriage—I do not remember that he said anything about it—he wished to carry on the acquaintance—he said he thought we should be happy and wished to carry on the acquaintance—I said I thought we could not be happy and I thought it beat that we should break it off at once—when he left me he told me to remember Baker—he did not tell me what he meant by that but I understood that he meant the young man that murdered the young woman at Southampton as he had often spoken about it—he spoke about it at the time when Baker s trial was going on we had conversed about it—we spoke about the newspaper and things that were in it and about the trial—on the evening of 7th July I recollect the youth Long calling with a parcel—he delivered the parcel to me—I then saw the prisoner by the gate poet and he rushed out and fired the pistol at me—I saw him push the boy—I cannot say exactly how near he was to me when he fired the pistol but I should say he could not have been much further than a yard or two—I heard the report of the pistol—I was struck in the eye and fell I was not insensible—I remember being taken into the house—I was afterwards taken to St Mary s Hospital—I had seen the prisoner the evening before Sunday the 7th I went to let my mistress in from Church and saw him running towards the gate—I had not made any appointment with him for that evening—I cannot remember how long it was before that I had spoken to him—I am twenty-three years old Cross-examined Q Where was it that you first met this young man A At his master s Mr Gill—I went there to see Mr and Mrs Gill—that was where the acquaintance first sprang up—a short time after the acquaintance commenced we began to correspond—that correspondence continued for seven months—he always professed himself devotedly attached to me he always appeared so—we have been out walking together—he has made me one present—he generally behaved with the greatest kindness and affection both by word and by letter but I found that he was of a jealous disposition—his proposals to me were proposals of marriage—I do not think I have ever written to him calling myself his affectionate Emily I do not remember saying so—I kept his company for a little time after he proposed marriage—these two letters looking at them are in my handwriting—I remember now that I have called myself his affectionately—I do not know when this letter was written but I think I had Dot written to him for some time before this I think it was in the early part of this year—it is addressed from No 1 Delamere-terrace Westbourne-terrace Hyde Park I was living there at that time—I do not think this letter was written in April I do not think I wrote a letter to him in April but I cannot remember—when he proposed marriage to me in April I did not give him an answer—he told me that he was in a good situation and could keep me happy and comfortable and that he would do his best and devote his life and his energies to keep me happy and comfortable as a married woman—I did not give him any answer MR RIBTON Q After the offer of marriage was made to you do you recollect whether you wrote to him A Yes I wrote one letter after I gave him my denial I wrote a letter of denial to him—I should say that was nearly a month after the offer of marriage—these letters were written before the offer of marriage—I never promised to marry him—at the time he made me the offer in April he asked me to consider it—I did take time to consider and then wrote the letter I told him first—on 18th May I told him at the gate that I wished to break off the acquaintance—I told him that I found him to be of a jealous disposition and I thought we could never live happily together if that was the case and I wished to break off the acquaintance ANNE WINTER I live at No 8 Howley-place Villas I am a single woman I recollect the day this transaction occurred—on the sunday before I saw the prisoner there between their gate and ours walking to and fro—I saw him there about 9 o clock—I stood and looked at him a few minutes I cannot say how long I saw him for a few minutes but I saw him several times in the course of the evening but only merely a few minutes at a time—he was walking up and down GEORGE MOSELEY I am shopman to Mr Charles Heed a pawnbroker On 5th July I sold this pistol I believe to the prisoner but I will not swear to him Cross-examined Q You have no doubt about the pistol A No I can swear to that it has got my private mark on it ALFRED PAYNE policeman D 235 I recollect the evening that the prisoner came to the Paddington station—he produced the pistol and said I am your prisoner —I was locked up with the prisoner during that evening—he said he did it that he was determined to do it he was determined to take her life that it would not have happened if she had sent him an honourable letter—I said it was a bad job—he said he should have been very sorry if he had hurt the young man that was there but he did not think he could have done it for he pulled him away with his left hand and fired with his right—he said he bought the pistol in Chapel-street but he did not know at which shop that he put three charges in it that he saw her fall and he came away Cross-examined Q He was in a very excited state all the time A He was all the time I was with him he was more like a madman than a sane man all the time I was with him EMILY LUKER re-examined About a month or six weeks before this occurred we had a supper at my master s house to which the prisoner was invited—I did not invite a young man a butcher to the supper he called I there and he staid to supper he came to see a fellow servant of mine—that young man was not paying his addresses to me but to my fellow servant—there was an angry feeling between the prisoner and me with respect to that young man MR RIBTON Q Was it after that that you gave him the denial A Yes and told him about his being of a jealous disposition the supper was on 12th May and on the 18th I gave him a denial—the young man was not paying his addresses to me but to my fellow servant s sister JOSEPH HENRY PROSSER STAPLES I am house surgeon at St Mary s Hospital The prosecutrix was brought there in the beginning of July last—I was called down stairs and found her in the waiting room lying on a couch—her face was covered—I uncovered it and found it very much blackened and there was bleeding from the right eye—the face was also very much swollen—she was removed into the ward—I afterwards examined the right eye—it was destroyed the iris was protruding the eye itself was completely destroyed—there was a lacerated wound over the outer part of the orbit above—the bone was bared—it was such a wound as would have been inflicted by stones of this description tired from a pistol—I considered it a dangerous wound at the time—she has been under my care nearly up to the present time—she has completely lost her eye—I cannot say that she is out of danger yet she might have a relapse Cross-examined Q Did you in making your examination of the parts discover any stone or fragment of stone A No I did not Q A discharge of powder so close to the face of the girl would cause the same injuries without any atones at all would it not A It must be very close no I do not think it would—it would not—the periosteum would not have been denuded from the bone unless it had been touching the face—if the pistol had been touching the face it might hare done so—supposing that the pistol was close up to the face and then discharged the appearances I observed might be caused by powder alone without any stone being in the pistol MR KIBTON Q Do you think that at the distance of two or three yards the powder alone could have inflicted a severe wound of that sort A Certainly not—if the pistol had been touching the akin the bone would very probably have been denuded but I cannot say that it would certainly not at the distance of a yard JOHN GRAY I am an M D of the University of Edinburgh and live at No 1 Howley-place nine doors from where the prosecutrix lived I heard the report of the pistol as I was reading in my own room—I went out into my front garden to see what it was and a woman came in a great hurry—I went to see the young woman I found her lying on a bed bleeding profusely from the eye and the forehead—I examined it I found the integuments severed from the frontal portion of the bone and falling over the cheek and a small portion of the bone exposed—the eye itself was burst and gone—it was such a wound as would have been inflicted by stones of this description fired from a pistol—I should say it could not have been caused by powder alone you might have had a contused wound but not the integuments dragged from the bone—I-should think powder could not have done that COURT Q Suppose that a stone had struck the face would it have lodged there or gone away A It would depend upon circumstances—the pistol must have been fired very close to the head or she would have been killed if it had been a few yards from her she would have been killed in fact so near must the pistol have been to her that a great portion of the powder even did not explode—it is possible that the stones might have been fired from the pistol and have struck the face and then dropped on account of the close proximity to the face—there would be no windage and there would be no momentum if it had been at any distance it would have gone into her brain—the pistol must have been very close indeed The prisoner s statement before the Magistrate was read at follows I am extremely sorry that I injured her my mind and feelings were too wounded I could not master them I did not know what I was doing MR SLEIGH called GEORGE GIBSON JACOBS I am a nurseryman and florist I have known the prisoner since Feb last—I knew him in Covent-garden market for a year or two before but I have known him more particularly since Feb and until the time this took place—he has always been an amiable well-conducted moral young man honest sober and industrious—he was in my employ—as I came here voluntarily I think there is one thing that I ought to state COURT Q Are you going to speak of what you know of your own knowledge A Yes it relates to about the time when the butcher was invited to take supper at the house—I was not present then but from that time up to the time of this occurrence the prisoner was not like the same man—I set him to do something to some verbenas to frames and he smashed the frames and the lights and I believe he had not his proper senses and during that week he demanded four different arrangements of wages of me—all my men said that he was turned cranky and I am firmly convinced that he had not his proper senses at the time William Gill nurseryman in whose employ We prisoner had been for two years also deposed to his good character GUILTY on the 2nd Count Aged 23 Transported for Twenty Years Before Mr Baron Bromwell and the First Jury 
t18561027-1002  1002 THOMAS DENNIS was indicted for feloniously wounding Edward Bevan with intent to murder him —2nd COUNT with intent to do grievous bodily harm MESSRS BODKIN and CLERK conducted the Prosecution EDWARD BEVAN I am one of the trade warden in Pentonville prison—there is a ward there in which trades are taught to the convicts On 9th Oct the prisoner was in confinement in the prison under sentence—on that day he was in the trade ward—he was learning the trade of a shoemaker—he was provided with a set of tools such as are used by shoemakers a knife a rasp a seat a file a hammer pincers nippers and rubber—on 9th Oct I observed the prisoner do something which was contrary to the rules of the prison—he was turning in order to speak to other prisoners while at exercise in the rope yard—he nodded his head to speak to other prisoners—the rules of the prison with regard to speaking to other prisoners were perfectly well known to him—they were read to him on the first day of his admission and they are read once a month during the time they are in the prison—he can read them himself he is a first class prisoner and able to do so—they have a copy of the rules hanging inside the cell doors—I did not speak to the prisoner about this at the time but I gave orders to another warder who was there to send the prisoner to his cell—next morning I reported what I had seen to the governor that was my duty—the prisoner was taken before the governor at a quarter past 9 o clock in the morning was present—the governor said it was bad conduct and he should punish him for so doing and he ordered me to open the door to send him to his cell again—no punishment was ordered at that time—he works at his trade in his cell—the prisoners have bells in their cells and as they ring them a number projects from the wall so that you can see which prisoner wants yon—about 20 minutes past 12 o clock I heard the prisoner s bell ring—I went to his cell and opened the door but did not go in—he said he wanted a sole for the shoe which he was then making as the sole he had got was not large enough—I told him I would go and get a sole for him as I had not one with me at that time—I went away and returned in about two minutes—I went into his cell and picked the shoe up off his seat and the sole as well—he liad thrown the sole on the floor for me to pick it up when was there before but I would not stoop to pick it up for him—I then took the shoe to go and get a sole for it and as I was leaving the cell with my face outwards the prisoner came behind me and struck me in the left shoulder—I turned round and said 26 you have struck me I shall report you in the morning for this occurrence —he then sprang on me caught me round the upper part of the muscles of the arm and wrestled with me to try to throw me down—I had the use of my arm and the shoe in my hand with the last in it and I struck him over the head three or four times till he released me from his hold—he then took a pair of claws which are tools used for closing brought them across his shoulder and said You b—— I will knock your brains out for you —I then retreated baokwards wards out of the cell and shut the door after me—I called out for the assistance of warder Laffan—he came on the third time of my calling but previous to his coming I felt a severe pain in my shoulder every time I breathed—I told him that 26 had struck me he said Good God there is a knife sticking in your shoulder now —and he pulled the knife from my shoulder—this is it produced —when I gave this knife to the prisoner it was nearly as wide at the point as it is at the end it was only a piece of a knife without a handle used for scraping the bottom of the shoes—he has sharpened it and placed a handle to it—the handle belongs to a seat file which I have here producing it —the knife has been sharpened at both sides and at the point and filed down at the back—I gave it to him on the 4th—there had been no angry words between the prisoner and me before this no further than my reporting him for being idle and neglecting his work—I never told him of it it was not my duty to do so—he knew I should report him by sending him in from the yard on the previous day Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q What did you say when you went into his cell the first time A All I said to him was What do you want 26 —that is his cell number—he was sitting on his cell stool with his right hand in his jacket pocket—with his left he threw the sole on the floor and said I want a sole for this shoe in an insolent manner—he was about four feet from me—I said nothing to him at that time I only shut the door and left him—I said I had not got a sole with me I would go and fetch one—I then went to No 36 which was an empty cell where 1 kept my tools and spare work to see if I had got a sole to suit him but I had not—I did not pick up the sole he threw down—he did it in rather an insolent manner—I said nothing to him about that—I did not feel a bit irritated I thought it impertinent and I should have reported him for it on the following morning—I did not tell him ao—I dare say I did fed a little annoyed—I came back to his cell in about two minutes and said Now 26 what is it you want —he said This sole is not large enough for the shoe I am making —I then took the sole and the shoe and found it was not big enough and was in the act of leaving the cell to get another for him—I have related all that passed—I did not show any symptoms of irritation when went in the second time—I was going out when he struck me in the back—I did not immediately turn round and strike him—I turned and said 26 I shall report you for striking me in the morning —he clasped me round the upper part of my arm and I struggled with him—it was then that I struck him with the shoe—that did not knock him down it released him from me—he is not five feet high I think—I do not know what he was here for—the last time I had seen this knife was when I gare it to him on 4th Oct —I gave him all his tools at that time MICHAEL LAFFAN I am a warder at Pentonville prison I was called to by Bevan on the morning of the 10th—I went to him in the gallery and took from his shoulder the knife produced THOMAS HURST I am a warder at Pentonville prison After this occurrence took place the prisoner was placed in the refractory ward—on the morning of 11th Oct I went there with another warder to see him searched—the other warder said to the prisoner I am afraid this will be at bad job for you my man Mr Bevan I understand is very ill and not likely to recover —the prisoner replied A good job too I hope the b—will die Cross-examined Q What time was this A Between 6 and 7 o clock on the morning of the 11th—the other warder is not here CHARLES BRADLEY I am surgeon at Pentonville prison On the morning of 10th Oct I saw Bevan—I found him bleeding from a wound in the back—I examined it—it was a punctured wound about half an inch in width with a direction downwards and outwards just above the blade bone and from the symptoms shown by the warder afterwards I ascertained that the knife had penetrated the chest and wounded the lungs—the wound was of a dangerous character it was just above the blade bone on the left side between the blade bone and the spine about two inches and a half from the central line of the back—it had reached the Iung—the bkde is about three inches long—I did not expect that two inches oould have reached the lung hut it had done so for he spat blood as he went home which blood would only have occurred from the lung having been wounded—it must have been done with considerable force Cross-examined Q How do you know that he spat blood A I saw some blood in the vessel where he spat—there was evidence of the lung having been wounded there was evidence of irritation of the lung for some time afterwards EDWARD BEVAN re-examined I spat blood for seven days successively I bad never done so before this GUILTY

t18570406-493  493 WILLIAM WEBB alias Philip Levy feloniously stabbing Alfred Buckler upon his neck and left arm with intent to murder 2nd COUNT with intent to do grievous bodily harm MR PAYNE conducted the Prosecution ALFRED BUCKLER I live at Mr Hollick s a draper in High Street Poplar as an assistant On 5th March I was at the Poplar station of the Blackwall Railway—it was half past 8 o clock when I took my ticket there—I was going to the Hampstead Road—I had to change carriages at Stepney and got into a second class carriage on the North London line that was about 20 minutes past 8 o clock—there were several passengers in the carriage but all of them got out at the Camden Town station and left me alone—as the train was about to start from the Camden Town station I observed the prisoner look in at the window of the carriage—he opened the door and got in—I was sitting in the corner he seated himself on the opposite seat about the middle of it—he was quite a stranger to me—he asked me what was the next station—I told him Hampstead Road—he said That s right —he then moved up the seat opposite to me—he said It is about half past 8 o clock is it not what is the time —I took out my watch and said it was 25 minutes past 8 all but a minute—I then put my watch into my pocket again and turned my head to look out of the window—I then felt a violent blow strike me in the neck I sprang to my feet—I then felt myself struck in the arm in the same manner—I grappled with the prisoner and he nearly overpowered me when I saw a knife in his left hand—we were then in the middle of the seat where he sat when he first got into the carriage—I caught at the blade of the knife with my right hand—it was a sticking knife not a clasped knife—this is it produced —I caught his neck and wrist with my left hand and pushed him up into the corner—he struck me with the right hand but the knife was in his left when I held it—I pushed him up into the corner and called out Murder several times—the train was in motion all this time—I did not lose my hold of the knife at all until the train stopped—the injuries inflicted upon me were inflicted before I got hold of the knife—while I was holding the knife an attempt was made to draw it through my hand I felt it cut deeper I had only hold of it by the blade nothing else—while I was struggling with him for the knife I pushed his arm against the back of the seat to prevent him from pulling it through my hand—he struggled and tried to get away but I squeezed his throat—the speed of the train was slackening at this time and was nearly stopping—I again called out Murder several times—I ascertained that I was wounded directly I caught the knife I felt that I was bleeding from my neck and arm—immediately the train stopped the carriage door was opened by a guard or porter and I said Take this man he has stabbed me —I still held him—he dropped the handle of the knife immediately the door was opened and said The knife is not mine this gentleman tried to stab me and in self defence I stabbed him —I did not observe whether he was wounded in any way—I gave the knife to the porter by the handle it was not my knife I had a small clasped knife—I did not use it in any way—I did not take it out of my pocket—I did not make any attack upon the prisoner before I was stabbed—the blade of the knife is not so sharp lower down where I held it or it would have cut my hand through—I was taken into the office of the station and a surgeon attended me directly—I was sent home by a special train and have been attended several times since by two surgeons Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q How long have you been in Mr Hollick s employment A Nine months—I was going to the Colosseum that evening to meet a friend—I live at my employer s house at Poplar—I left there about 20 minutes to 8 o clock—I had dined and had my tea—I went straight from my employer s to the railway—I had not been to any other house—I had not had anything to drink—I think there were four compartments to the carriage I was in open one to the other—there was no one in any of the four compartments at the time this happened—I had put my watch back into my pocket—I had not accidentally trodden on the prisoner s toe or he on mine nothing of the kind—I said nothing to him angrily we had no words besides the time and the next station COURT Q How was it that you say you caught his wrist and left hand A I had his wrist in this manner pressed against his throat and my finger nail and thumb nail against his throat—I pressed his wrist against his throat—about two minutes elapsed from the time I was first struck on the neck till the train stopped—no conversation occurred as to how far we were from the station merely the name of the station—the train had not begun to slacken speed when I was first struck we had only just left the station when he asked me the question—my clothes are here which I had on at the time WILLIAM SANDFORD I am a porter on the North London Railway On 5th March I was on duty at the Hampstead Road station when the train came in about 20 minutes past 8 o clock—I was standing against the signal post watching for its arrival—while standing there I heard cries of Murder and Help from one of the carriages—I jumped across the buffers of the carriages and made my way to the carriage as quickly as possible—I saw the prosecutor and prisoner inside they both appeared as if they were in a struggle—I saw the knife the prisoner had hold of the handle aud the prosecutor had hold of the blade—the prosecutor said to me For God s sake porter this man has been trying to murder me take the knife —as soon as he spoke that the prisoner let go his grasp of the handle and the prosecutor handed me the knife by the handle holding it by the blade it was dripping with blood at the time I took it—the station master led the prosecutor from the carriage into the secretary s room—I saw blood oozing over the top of his neck cloth he seemed to be quite in a fainting state—I secured the prisoner till one of the other servants went outside and found a policeman—there was no one but the prisoner and prosecutor in either of the compartments of that carriage—when I took hold of the prisoner he said Oh the knife don t belong to me it belongs to that gentleman he tried to stab me and I took it away from him and stabbed him instead —the prosecutor said That is false —I gave the knife to the policeman JAMES WEBB Police sergeant 516 On the night of 5th March I was at the police station in Albany-street the prisoner was brought there about a quarter past 9 o clock—I asked him his name—he said William Webb —I asked where he lived—he said I sha n t tell you —he said he did not wish his parents to know that he was in trouble—I asked him hid occupation—he said a sailor—he said that the gentleman attempted to stab him and that he took the knife from him and stabbed him instead—I took the prisoner back to the railway station in Hampstead Road and there found the prosecutor in the secretary s office—when he saw the prisoner he said he was the man that had stabbed him and he related the circumstances as he has done to-day—after I returned to the station I noticed that the prisoner s hands were covered with blood and also blood on his face—I did not observe any wounds on his hands and face corresponding with the blood—on my noticing the blood the prisoner said It is blood the gentleman attempted to stab me and in endeavouring to take the knife from him I cut my hand —he then pointed to a slight wound on the middle finger of the left hand and also to a scratch on the lower part of the thumb of the left hand—I said These wounds have never bled —he made no reply to that—there were no signs whatever on the prisoner of his having been wounded with the knife—on searching him I found one duplicate a few lucifer matches a halfpenny and two or three buttons—I found no railway ticket and no money but the halfpenny—the knife is quite new and never appears to have been used—it is called a butcher s trimming knife STEPHEN HALFORD I am a surgeon at Haverstock Hill Hampstead near the Hampstead Road station On 5th March between 8 and 9 o clock in the evening I was called to attend to the prosecutor—he was sitting in a chair quite faint his clothes much stained with blood and a handkerchief tied round his neck was also saturated with blood—on removing the handkerchief I found a wound on the left side of the neck about two inches from the ear—it was about an inch in length and about the same depth the edges were smooth so that it was made by a sharp instrument—it was about the width of this knife it was a stab apparently made by the point of the knife—it went certainly within half an inch of the carotid artery and I should think the end of the wound must have been much nearer as it inclined forward—it was a very dangerous wound—on taking off his clothes I found a wound on the outer side of the left arm about the same size but twice as deep it was quite two inches deep that was also made by stabbing and it inclined upwards also—there was a bruise at the right side of the back of the neck that was altogether distinct from the wound—there were some scratches over the right eyebrow and the right side of the chin—there were two slight cuts on his right hand scarcely through the skin between the forefinger and thumb—it would have required a good deal of violence to cause the wound in the neck to get the knife in the depth that it went the wound in the arm must have been given with even more force it was deeper ALFRED BUCKLER re-examined I had on a great coat and a light under coat and a great coat belonging to a friend over my arm—I had a silk scarf round my neck four times doubled and my collar—the cut was through that—I have my scarf here producing it —this is where it was cut with the first blow—this produced is the coat I had on here was the blow in the arm and there was another directly under the arm that did not touch me and there were three stabs in the back of the collar which did not touch my body—the coat protected and saved my body from those four stabs it is thickly wadded under the arm which was the cause of its not touching me DAVID MYERS I am a butcher in Middlesex Street Whitechapel The prisoner was in my service as a butcher his name is Philip Levy he was not in the habit of killing cattle he was only a lad to take out the meat Cross-examined Q Was he addicted to intemperance or anything of that kind A Not at all that I know of—he was a well behaved lad while in my service—I always thought him a kind humane lad JURY Q Was he in your service at this time A No he had left me seven months when this occurred GUILTY on the 2nd Count Aged

t18570615-710  710 CHARLES MELBOURNE 27 Feloniously wounding William Murrell with intent to murder 2nd COUNT with intent to do grievous bodily harm MESSRS BODKIN and ROBINSON conducted the Prosecution GIDEON CROCKER Police sergeant G 9 On Saturday morning 6th June about 20 minutes past 2 o clock I was on duty in the Haymarket and saw the prisoner in company with another man—I had received information with respect to a burglary that had been committed—I did not know the prisoner sufficiently to justify me in apprehending him but I had information that led me to believe that he was connected with that burglary—I was standing at the corner of Panton Street they passed me down the Haymarket and I believe went into a public house—I immediately sent to the station and Murrell another constable came—we went into the public house and not finding them there we came out and found them in the Haymarket standing with three females under a shop front about three doors from the corner of James Street close underneath the shutters of the house—Murrell and I walked down the Haymarket and the prisoner and his male companion immediately made round the corner of James Street and went along James Street—I suppose they had recognised us—after they got round the corner they separated—I followed the prisoner when he had gone some distance he suddenly turned round and faced me at the same time having both hands in his pocket—I came up to him and said that he must go with me that he was wanted for an attempt at burglary—Murrell at the same time came up and said That is the man —he took hold of him on one side and I on the other and walked along James Street—when we had got about half way along James Street I asked Murrell where the other man was—he said he did not know—I said Then you secure this one and I will go and look for him —I then left them Murrell having hold of the prisoner and went towards the Haymarket I had scarcely reached the Haymarket before I heard the report of firearms and a call for assistance—I immediately turned back and saw Murrell having hold of the prisoner by the left arm and four females surrounding him—just as I got up to him Murrell said For God s sake lay hold of him he has shot me —a second pistol was then fired—I saw the prisoner s right arm up and the smoke appeared to come from the direction where he stood—I got in at him as quickly as I could between the women and secured him by the other arm—I took him to the station and searched him—I found on him this knife eleven gun caps forty-five small shot and five pebbles four that fit the pistol and one that will not—Murrell had the pistol and took it to the station—I also found on the prisoner two boxes of lucifer matches a ramrod that fits the pistol and 10s 11 1/2 d in money—the charge was read over to him he made no reply Cross-examined by MR METCALFE Q Can you tell at all in what direction the second pistol was fired A Yes I should say by the appearance that it was directed at me I judge so from the position in which the prisoner stood and the way in which he lifted his right arm up that it was meant for me as I came up I was about three yards from the prisoner and the four women were between me and him and Murrell he must have fired over their heads he was rather above me because he was on the pavement and I was on the carriage way—there were no other persons round at that moment to my recollection I did not see any I was intent on Murrell seeing the state he was in I did not look round—I do not know who was behind me—the other man who had been with the prisoner was gone he was not behind the women—he could not have been in the street or I should have seen and secured him—I did not see anybody but Murrell the prisoner and the four women at the moment the pistol was fired—others came up immediately afterward other constables came up immediately—I have no doubt that the pistol was fired by the prisoner s hand from the direction of the smoke—I could not undertake to swear positively that it was fired by him but the smoke came from the direction of his hand and I saw his hand up at the same time—I should judge that three of the women were the same that I had seen with the prisoner and his companions in the Hay-market by their dress and appearance but I had not the opportunity of seeing their faces—Murrell had hold of the prisoner s left arm I believe getting the pistol away from him—I could not say exactly what they were doing I could not say they were struggling—the prisoner s back was towards the railings and Murrell was facing him WILLIAM MURRELL Policeman C 80 I was on duty at the station on Saturday 6th June in consequence of a message that was brought there I went to the Haymarket and found sergeant Crocker at the corner of Panton Street—I was in my police uniform and so was Crocker—we went into a public house to see if the prisoner was there he was not—we waited a few minutes outside the public house door and we then saw the prisoner in company with another man at the corner of James Street we went down towards them Crocker went first—the two men separated and ran away up James Street towards Leicester Square—they took different routes Crocker went after the prisoner springing his rattle and I followed him I observed Crocker come up with him—the prisoner turned round and faced him deliberately when I was within two or three yards of them—I told Crocker in the prisoner s hearing that he was the man—I had been looking for him before for some reason I had I thought it proper that he should be apprehended—Crocker and I secured him and walked back down Panton Street into James Street the same direction in which we had followed the prisoner—when we got into James Street Crocker said Where is the other man —I said I do not know the other man had entirely disappeared then—Crocker said You take charge of the prisoner and I will see if I can find him he left me with the prisoner in James Street—as soon as Crocker had left the prisoner asked me what he wanted him for I told him he had better ask him—we walked about two paces further when he fired the contents of this pistol into my face—I did not observe where he took the pistol from—I had him by the right sleeve and he put his hand up to my face—it was with his left hand that he fired it it was close to my face when he fired it I should say not further than three or four inches if so far—I was wounded in the mouth—I retained my hold of him wrenched the pistol from his hand and called for assistance—Crocker came up and on his coming up the prisoner fired a second pistol at him—Crocker was then about two or three yards off coming towards me from the Haymarket—the prisoner fired the second pistol with his right hand—I did not see any one near at that time—I believe there were some women they did not interfere—this pistol I wrenched out of his left hand—I could not find the other pistol and I never have found it—I was taken in a cab to the hospital—there was a pebble in my face that had been fired from the pistol it was cut out it had gone through to the jaw Cross-examined Q It was a marble was it not A No a stone the surgeon has it—I believe it took a direction a little sideways but I cannot say exactly—I could not tell whether the pistol was pointed right at me or sideways—I was not struggling with the prisoner before he fired he was walking very quietly he never resisted the least till he fired—I did not notice what he was doing until he actually fired—when he fired the second pistol I had got him in custody and was struggling with him AUGUSTUS OLIVER APLIN I am house surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital On the morning of 6th June Murrell was brought there about 3 o clock—I found a lacerated wound on the left side of the chin about a quarter of an inch in circumference—it was not bleeding then but evidently had been—I probed the wound and discovered a foreign body impacted in the soft parts round the chin—this is the pebble produced it reached the bone—it had evidently been stopped in its progress by the bone—the wound in itself was not dangerous through the stone not having gone farther and also from the impulsive force not having been sufficient to injure the jaw I suppose there was not sufficient gunpowder put in—it was directed inwards and to the right side the chances are if it had gone in straight it would have turned towards the neck towards the large arteries it is a great Providence that it did not do so Cross-examined Q Judging from what you saw was not the pistol in all probability fired sideways A I should think it had not been directed straight to the man I should think it had been fired sideways GUILTY on the Second Count — Transported for Life

No 15 Church Way New Road St Pancras On Sunday morning 17th May between 9 and 10 o clock I sent my son on an errand—he had not been gone a minute or so before I heard somebody say There is two upon one it is not fair or something of that sort—I went out and saw two boys fighting my boy and just as I got up to the boys the prisoner s wife was there and she turned away—I separated them and sent my boy away about his business—I then went and spoke to a neighbour named Norman—I still kept my eye on the prisoner s shop for I had a mistrust for some time past that he intended to do me some injury—I could not see him and I went past and when I got opposite his door he threw a quart tin pannikin of vitriol at me and said Take that you old b— that will warm you — The witness who appeared in a very weak state here became very unwell Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q I believe your son had been quarrelling before this day A Not that I know of I am very little at home and when I am at home I am at work—this being Sunday morning I should say the prisoner was sober he spoke so—I have known him for some time unfortunately—I believe he is at times in the habit of getting drunk Q Have you ever been charged with an assault upon him A I believe he has managed that many times for he can always get plenty to swear anything he asks them for a glass of gin—he is a low man and keeps low company—I have never been fined for committing an assault upon him but he has and threw a basket of fire over my little girl and set fire to her—I believe he managed to get me fined 1l for an assault upon him there has been plenty of false swearing by a public house lot—to the best of my recollection I think it was inquired into before the Magistrate—I cannot answer whether I was fined 1l for I do not recollect I believe I was fined something—I cannot answer whether that has happened more than once I think not—I have always been a good neighbour towards the prisoner—on the Saturday night previous to this as I stood at my door he asked me to go and drink with him—I said No John thank you I have had my allowance for to-night —he said Yes and a good job for you you old b—that you do not come —the prisoner s wife was there when I went up to the boys—she and I did not have any quarrel not a word—there were other persons there beside his wife—I know a person named Baldwin—I believe I saw him but it was as much as I did—I do not know the prisoner s eldest son John Brett—I will swear I did not strike the prisoner s wife that morning—I never lifted my hand to a woman ELIZA ROBINSON I am the prosecutor s wife On Sunday morning 17th May I sent my son on an errand—my husband went out to separate him and two boys—I saw the prisoner standing at his door with a quart tin pot in his hand and as my husband returned he threw the contents of the tin pot over his head and face saying Take that you old b— that will warm you —he repeated that more than once—my husband at first thought it was water till he had gone a few paces and then he said Oh Eliza I am burning take me to the hospital —it burnt his clothes and also burnt my hand and arm—he was taken to University College Hospital Cross-examined Q Do you know what the prisoner is A He keeps a broker s shop—he would not require vitriol to use in his business he makes bedsteads—I saw the quarrel between the boys—I saw the prisoner s wife come and take my boy by the hair of his head and strike him in the face—that was the reason of my calling my husband to separate them ISABELLA MILLS I live opposite the prisoner On this Sunday morning I heard the quarrelling between the boys—I did not see what happened after that but I heard Mr Robinson s footsteps and I heard Mr Brett say I will warm you you old b— and he instantly threw a something and a portion of it came over me and over some clothes hanging up behind me and burnt them dreadfully Cross-examined Q Did you see the prisoner s wife A I saw her go towards the boys and I went and took her two children from the scuffle and I saw her and her brother in a quarrel with her son and the prosecutor s son I cannot say that I saw a blow struck THOMAS TURNER Policeman S 365 I took the prisoner into custody on the Sunday morning—he said he hoped what he had thrown over the old b—would kill him—he said that both in going to the station and afterwards—I produce the clothes that the prosecutor was wearing Cross-examined Q About what time was it that you took the prisoner A About 10 o clock—he was perfectly sober—I only know him by sight THOMAS VINCENT JACKSON I am house surgeon at University College Hospital On Sunday 17th May I saw Robinson there about a quarter to 11 o clock—his clothes were almost entirely covered with vitriol—the left side of his neck and face was almost charred in some places the skin was quite black—he was not able to speak or to answer any question for an hour or two he was in a state of collapse—I attended carefully to him and hope he is now getting on—he has been under my care ever since MR RIBTON stated that he could not resist a conviction but catted witnesses to the prisoner s good character and also to show that he had the vitriol on his premises for use in his trade GUILTY — Transported for Fifteen Years

Street Waterloo Road I am an unfortunate woman and live in an apartment in that house—the prisoner has occupied another apartment there—she was not doing so when this happened—she was staying with a party that was living in the house—she had not slept there that night—she had slept there the last week up to that time—before that she had been seeing her friends in the country for two months—she had been back a week—she had been sleeping in the front parlour of that house—I occupy the back parlour—on Monday 1st June I returned home about 4 o clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoner sitting

and gave me a violent blow and knocked me down—I had a dreadful black eye—she gave me a great many blows—she knocked the senses out of me—the blow fell on the back of my head and took my senses away—I called to the landlord to assist me and carry me in—I do not recollect anything after that—I do not know how I got in I was taken in—the next time I saw the prisoner was on the following morning when I saw her about 1 o clock just in the parlour door—I was up stairs I went down stairs and said Jane what did you give me such a black eye for —she said You b— I will give you another —I stood at the door and she came at me with a pair of scissors—she struck me over the forehead there is a mark there—she pushed the scissors at me—she took hold of my hair and I took hold of her s—I afterwards went up stairs and fastened myself in a room she came up stairs and broke the door open—in my room there was a quart pot on the table I saw the prisoner take it up—my fellow-lodger was in the room and she said Jane I will not have any disturbance made in my room —the prisoner took up the pot and held it up first at her she then came up to me and said You b— I will do for you —I moved to the other side of the fire place—she came and struck me a blow over the head she cut my head open—my eye was still bleeding—I put my hands up to my head as the blood was flowing from me and said Oh Jane how can you

standing just in the front parlour door—that was in her room—it was the room where she had been sleeping—she had not slept there that night—she did not pay any rent Cross-examined by MR LAXTON Q Up to the previous night had she been living there A Yes—this took place just by the parlour door close by the passage—she was standing there when I came in—I did not say anything else besides about her not paying all the rent—she got up when I said that—I cannot say whether I pushed her away from me after I said that—I did not when she knocked me down—it is a middling sized passage—I did not push her at all—the first thing she did was she got up and knocked me down—there were a few people round when I was knocked down there was not a mob—there was not a scuffle between me and the prisoner—she would not let me pass in—there was no scuffle between us—there had been no disagreement between us before—we were not particular friends—I cannot say whether she sent for two oysters to put on my eye I had some in the house—they were applied to my eye—I do not know that she expressed her sorrow at what had taken place—I do not know that she asked me to lie down—I do not know when I recovered my consciousness—I have heard the prisoner say that she was about to remove from that house where she had been lodging with me to another house—the second assault took place on the next day about 1 o clock in the day—I did not go down and open the door when I heard her knock—I was up stairs at the time I went down after she had come in I asked her why she gave me that black eye—she said that if I was not satisfied with that she would give me another one—I did not take hold of her hair before she took the scissors—I believe she took the scissors from off the drawers but I cannot say—the drawers were standing close by the door in the parlour—she was just inside the parlour door—I did not see her go to the drawers and take the scissors I cannot say whether she did or not she had them in her hands when I saw them—we had no scuffle before the scissors were used—I am not in the habit of using bad language—the scissors were not used in a struggle between us it was all done in a moment—I had not put my fingers on her before she took up the scissors—I cannot say whether she had the scissors in her hand before I was struck—the parlour is not a very large room—she did not rush suddenly at me she was standing just inside the door—she was close to me all this time—there is a pair of scissors generally lying on the drawers—I do not know whether they require scissors in their work—I believe I was struck with the scissors at the same time that we had one another by the hair—it was all done in a moment—I do not know that I saw the scissors before I felt them—I am quite sure it was done by something sharp and the blood came down—I am quite sure I did not seize her by the hair first—it was not long after that she struck me with the pewter pot—after the scuffle she went down stairs I think I did not see her go—I did not rush at her with a piece of an iron bolt I had nothing at all in my hand I can swear that—there was only one woman in the room when she struck me with the pewter pot Alice Bayley—she did not attack her—the door was locked—it was not very strong she broke it open—she did not say anything—I did not say anything to her—she held the pewter pot up at Alice Bayley

and took the scissors away from the prisoner—I came down stairs—the prisoner attempted to catch hold of her legs to throw her out of the window—she had a piece of rag or something in her hand which she tore off the sheet and she tried to put it up in front of Betsy s head so that the persons opposite should not see the blood flowing—she did not pull her back from the window she tried to throw her out—I had not been in the back parlour all day that is where the prosecutrix lives—there might have been something going on in the parlour but I did not see anything—she came in with her forehead bleeding Cross-examined Q Did you see anything of the row with the scissors A No only with the pewter pot I was not present at that time only when the policeman took the scissors from her—the prisoner was putting a rag on Betsy s head to stop the blood so that the people opposite should not see it—she said I am sorry you are come policeman or something of that sort—she was quite sober—she was very excited and angry—it is a manner that she has got she is very hasty at times—I know that after the blow had been struck over her eye in the first instance Jane sent for some oysters to put on Betsy s eye—I do not know whether she put them on I was not in the room—I do not know that she expressed any sorrow at the black eye that Betsy had got—she has rather a hasty temper—I did not ask her what was said when the prosecutrix came into the passage—she was sitting on the step of the door she and the man together when the prosecutrix came up—they were blocking up the whole of the steps so as to prevent anybody coming in—I was present at the door—all that the prosecutrix said was You don t pay all the rent of the house —I was sitting down in the passage by the side of Jane and the man—Betsy

ADAMS I am the landlord of the house in Granby Street I know the prosecutrix—on Monday 1st June I was in the kitchen and I heard a noise at the door and I heard Elizabeth Marsh say You don t pay all the rent of the house —I went up stairs and saw her lying on her back in the road—I got a female to help me and took her up stairs—she never spoke all the time till she was on the bed—the prisoner said she was going over to the public house—the next day about 1 o clock I was called up stairs—when I got there Jane White was in the parlour and Elizabeth Marsh was in the passage bleeding from a wound on her forehead—I took her into the parlour and shut the door and told her I would go and get a policeman—I did not see the wound inflicted—the prisoner was in the parlour at the time I had not seen her before but as I was going for the policeman she rushed out of the door with a pair of scissors in her hand—she made a stab at me—the scissors were about an inch and a half out of her hand—I held her by her two wrists—I got her outside the front door and shut it but she went to the window and broke it open—I went and got two policemen from the station—when the prosecutrix called out Murder the policeman went up stain—I saw the blood flowing from Betsy s face Cross-examined Q Did not the prisoner send you for two oysters to put on the eye A Yes—she did not express her sorrow to me nor to anybody in my presence—the oysters were for the purpose of taking the black from the eye—I am sure she told me to go she gave me the money—I cannot say whether they were put to the woman s eye—I gave them to Jane White and another person and then I went away—I did not separate the prosecutrix and the prisoner—I did not say at any time to the prosecutrix Why you will murder the woman —I did not see any row between them—I did not hear any more than I have stated—I did not see the prosecutrix attack the prisoner with a piece of iron on 2nd June—the prisoner did not appear to have been drinking—I thought she appeared very cool indeed considering what she was about FREDERICK ALLSTROM Policeman L 197 I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Granby Street on 2nd June—I heard a cry of Murder —I went to the house where the prosecutrix lives—I saw her out of the window with her head bleeding—I rushed up stairs and saw the prisoner with the pot in her hand—I thought she was going to hit me—I was about to draw my truncheon but she put it down—she said I am sorry you are come I meant to do for the b—— Cross-examined Q The prisoner was in a very excited state was she not A No she appeared to me to be very cool about it WILLIAM HENRY KEMPTON I am a surgeon residing in the Waterloo Road On Tuesday 2nd June the prosecutrix was brought to my surgery—the injury which I first observed was a large cut on the scalp—it must have been inflicted I think with some blunt edged weapon—it was a semicircular wound—some considerable force must have been used—it was of a very violent nature—I observed another small wound about two and a half inches in length which was done with a sharp weapon—it seemed to have been a blow that had missed its aim—she also had a black eye which had evidently been inflicted some time before—it was not bleeding it was closed—these scissors would produce such a wound—the wound on the head might have caused death in two or three ways from fracture of the skull or concussion of the brain or sometimes from fright—I have known a blow much less than that kill a person—I have known a person tumble on the front of the head and have a disorder of the brain—it might have produced fatal results—she was under my care—the wound is healed up now and I have not seen much of her Cross-examined Q Did you see the prisoner at all after these assaults I A Yes the next morning—she had two or three scratches on her forehead with a finger nail—her hair was done up nicely at that time—I could not tell whether it had been torn all over—she had sustained no particular injury—she said she felt very sore all over—I have no doubt the woman will entirely recover from the blow FREDERICK ALLSTROM re-examined The prisoner was taken to the station house in a cab—I got her in a cab but she broke all the windows—she said she was sorry I came for she meant to do for her—she repeated that a great many times at the station—I did not observe any symptom of her being insane—she was talking about Bedlam—we were not near Bedlam at the time—she said she was going to be sent there before—Serjeant Remain saw her while she was in custody—she has been in Newgate—the surgeon has seen her—he has not given any report of her JONATHAN ADAMS re-examined She had been living in that house about a week—she had been down to Wales—she had been up about a week—she was stopping there for some little time before she went to Wales—she had been at the house more than four or five weeks—I have known her for nearly two years—I have never observed anything particular about her GUILTY on the Second Count William Romain Police sergeant L 14 stated that the prisoner was tried and convicted last Oct for stabbing and wounding another person only a house or two from the one in which this occurred in the same street Transported for Life

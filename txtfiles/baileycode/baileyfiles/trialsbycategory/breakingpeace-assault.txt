t17931204-64  65 DAVID DAVIS was indicted for an assault The case opened by Mr Knapp JOHN DAWS Esq sworn Q Was you on the 18th of July going home or in your way home going down Ludgate Hill - I was I think it was about ten minutes after ten in the evening I overtook the prisoner just by the church on Ludgate Hill I heard him insulting and calling another little man names very abusive I then interfered and told the little person that Davis was insulting not to regard him he was walking behind him and calling him names he then went on to the corner of the Old Bailey I then took hold of this person that he was insulting by the arm pulled him from him and advised him to go on the other side of the way and if Davis followed him to charge the watch with him I then went on towards the Bell Savage Inn when the prisoner was exceedingly abusive to me for interfering I told him I thought he was a cowardly fellow for insulting a man of the size of the gentleman that I had desired to go away and he put himself in the attitude of boxing he put his hands up I told him it should not provoke me to strike him I told him that I believed in such cases people generally come off second best then a croud gathered around and they called out a fight a ring I endeavoured to go on I was pushed forwards towards the prisoner and finding they began to hustle me I suspected I should be robbed I then put my coat over my breeches pocket and my watch exactly in this position as I stood in this position he gave me a violent blow on the side of my nose which laid it all open I saw a watchman come up with a woman whosecured him in the moment he gave the blow he struck me and endeavoured to get away but I believe the people assisted him to take him Q I ask you whether you ever put yourself in a posture of defence or in an attitude to strike - I did not I told him I believe that if I was with him in a room I should not be afraid of him Q How long did you feel an inconvenience from this blow - I was obliged to have a doctor he attended me a fortnight I was confined to my room for two or three days it cut through the bridge of my nose Jury We can see the mark Prisoner When I first met you in what manner did I meet you - Was not you quarrelling with another little man Did not I say to him don t quarrel with that man and you said d-n you you rascal what is it to you I left you then Prisoner And then you came to me and said if I would go with you to a coffee-house and fight you and beat you you would give me a crown bowl of punch - I did say so Prisoner Did not I turn to you and say never mind he is only a taylor Court Do you know what the defendant is - I understand that he was a porter and discharged JANE SOWDEN sworn I happened to be on Ludgate Hill on the 18th of July I saw Mr Daws I was returning from making a visit and going home to St George s Fields from the city I saw that gentleman and this man and another man a short little man and I discovered a fray between this man and the little man there seemed a sort of a stand and a halt between them as if the little man was very much afraid of this man and they were inclined to make a riot in the street or to make a fight the gentleman there Mr Daws I did not know him then he said to the little man go on my good little fellow and go about your business for this man is too strong for you he will lick you he would kill you if you was to fight with him go along my good honest fellow go home and the little taylor as I heard this man call him went on the gentleman said to this man you should not use these expression you should not call him my little taylor because it aggravates the man let him go quietly home about his business and the gentleman spoke in a most gentleman like manner and this man the prisoner he rather halted and sidled up to Mr Daws and he said pray sir why do you interfere what business is it of your s Mr Daws said my dear fellow it is nothing at all to me but I don t like to see a fellow creature ill used and you appear to me to have quite set on that little fellow that is gone away then the young man talked to Mr Daws and behaved in a civil manner at first and this man said you had no business to trouble yourself with it and I believe he made rather up to him Mr Daws said I would rather have this watchman for my second Mr Daws said I would not attempt to fight you here if you could lick me in a room I would give you a crown bowl of punch but I am not a fighting man In the course of half a minute the prisoner said if you are a gentleman you should not put on a poor man and by this time there was a mob and I thought perhaps it would go very hard with the gentleman on account of this man striking him a blow he hit him a blow with his hand doubled a very violent blow indeed on the face I saw him hit him on the face Q Did you see Mr Daws put his hands up in a posture as if he was going to fight - I cannot say I did uponmy word and oath I am rather of opinion they were down Q Did you during the whole transaction ever see Mr Daws strike him at all - I did not He charged the watch with him Q How came you to see this transaction - I was in my road home and I had the curiosity to observe it Q Prisoner Did not you come to the watch-house that night and speak very partial on my side that night - I came to the watch-house Q Did not Mr Daws give you money at Guildhall the next day - He gave me five shillings Q How much has he given you since - Nothing Q What has he promised you since - Nothing he gave me the five shillings for my kindness in attending Q Did not he give the watchman half a crown - I cannot say what he gave the watchman Court to Daws How did you find this man he has been out at bail Clerk of the Court His bail brought him in the first day of last Sessions Mr Knapp There has been something said about the watchman being your second did you mean to fight - I did not I said he should be my second and I would charge him with the watch WILFORD TIFFIN sworn Q Do you know Mr Daws I do not Q Should you know him by sight - I know neither of them except that night I never saw neither of them before I am a bookbinder As I was coming home about ten o clock or about half past ten I saw a mob in Ludgate-street I was coming from the Strand I live in Castle Baynard I was in my way home I saw a mob and a watchman and the watchman that took charge of the prisoner and I crossed the way together I saw this Mr Daws put his fist clinched up to the other calling him a d-n d rascal a d-n d scoundrel and asked him if he would fight the watchman and I stood as spectators at the time the prisoner Davis said that he was a very poor man and he appeared like a gentleman he did not mean to affront him if he did he begged his pardon Mr Daws called him a number of ungentleman-like names there was no blow at that time between either of them he was as close as could be for one man to put his fist against another this man stood with his hands in his pockets all the time This gentleman Mr Daws told him that he understood boxing and if he would go with him to a tavern he would fight him and if he licked him he would give him a crown s worth of punch for his trouble the prisoner said he would go with him any where to fight him he was not afraid of him or he would fight him there Mr Daws did not seem in a mind to fight him there but he would if he would go into a private house it was in consequence of his being ill used that made him strike Mr Daws Q Now at the time he struck Mr Daws was Mr Daws s fist clinched before him - Mr Daws I suppose was going he had just turned and the mob said that he was big enough to take his own part Q On Mr Daws s being turned were the fist of Mr Daws in a clinched position against the prisoner - I cannot say they were then I went to the watch-house where the watchmen themselves said that they thought that Mr Daws had justice done him this was said to me only I said I would appear the next day to the Magistrate s at the Alderman s when I appeared I was too late and the constable told me that the gentleman had made a present to the woman of five shillings and to the watchman of half a crown and that they were bothagainst the prisoner I left him when he got his bail Q At the time that Mr Daws had his fist clinched did he or did he not tell him that he would fight him - He said he did not wish to fight in such a public manner Q Did not he make use of that expression at the time his fists were clinched that he would not fight him that he would fight him in a tavern - This he said some time before he was going I dare say it was a quarter of an hour the whole business Q You say that during one part of the time Mr Daws s fists were clinched - Yes Q How long was that before the man gave him the blow - The man gave him the blow just as he was going it might be ten minutes after that Mr Knapp You say the prisoner struck you are sure Mr Daws s hands were not clinched - He was going at that time Prisoner I think it is a very hard case I have been in the Poultry compter for eight weeks and I think it is a very hard case that I should be insulted in such a gross manner by him Mr Knapp addressed the jury on the witness s evidence for the prisoner GUILTY Recommended to the lenity of the court To be imprisoned a fortnight Tried by the first London Jury before Mr RECORDER 
t18141026-141  1008 JOSEPH BUTCHER was indicted for that he on the 26th of October in a certain place and street called Grosvenor-row upon Jane the wife of Thomas Bailey unlawfully did make an assault with intent to spoil burn and deface the clothes of her the said Jane Bailey that he did then and there in the said public street spoil burn and deface a gown value 20 s and a shawl value 10 s the property of Thomas Bailey upon her the said Jane Bailey JANE BAILEY My husband s name is Thomas Bailey Q Do you know the prisoner - A Yes Sunday I think was on the 16th of October on the Thursday evening previous to the Sunday I had something thrown over me my gown and every part of my dress was injured my shawl petticoat and stockings I set my son to watch on Sunday evening I told him not to leave me a moment Q Where had you been on Sunday - A To chapel I was returning from chapel when I met with this I returned from chapel about a quarter past eight in the evening I was about twenty yards from my own house in Grovesnor-row Chelsea I was coming home from chapel in the foot-path in the main street my son screamed out here he is he screamed out that something was thrown over me and I understood him to say Butcher I perceived the effect immediately on turning round I have the things in court I tested it it burnt my skin off my lip and water poured from my mouth in torrents it burnt my mouth very much and made my mouth water very much Q What effect did it produce upon your clothes what clothes did it injure - A Stockings shoes a shawl and a gown I valued my gown at twenty shillings this is my shawl that I had on on Sunday evening it has burned my gown in seven places it has burnt it all to pieces that was produced by the liquid thrown over it the gown was quite whole and almost new The shawl has many great holes in it the shawl was worth ten shillings and more than that I believe it was valued a pound at the office They were both in a perfect state before the liquid was thrown over them When the liquid was thrown over me I saw the prisoner cross the way my son accused him of doing it he said that Mr Butcher had thrown something over me Butcher denied it he said would he say that he did it yes the boy said he would say so before any magistrate in England That was all that happened at that time The boy supported his charge and the prisoner denied it My husband laid hold of him he did not search him he being a neighbour and it being a Sabbeth evening Q He was a neighbour - A Yes Q Had you been upon good terms - A We had no words I did not know that he owed me the least ill will in the world When my husband laid hold of him he let him go he did not want to take him from his wife and family that night Q Could you at all see the liquid or whatever it was that came from him - A I did not see it was behind me THOMAS BAILEY I am the husband of Mrs Bailey On the 16th of October I my son-in-law and my wife were coming from chapel I did not see the prisoner until after this matter happened all that I observed I was opposite of Mr Chapman s the baker in Grosvenor-row my son-in-law said to his mother there was something thrown over her again he gave the alarm in consequence of that I turned round and catched hold of the prisoner direct he was close to me I saw that my wife s clothes were burnt I asked the prisoner how he came to do it he denied it The boy accused him of it I found my wife s clothes were burnt The prisoner touched me on the waistcoat which stained my waistcoat my waistcoat is stained now I am not acquainted with the smell of aquafortis there was a very strong smell upon it and a very unpleasent one it was a strong smelling liquid that stained my waistcoat I washed the place since I believe the is a stain upon it now I let him go directly I was not aware of it at the time it happened at the time I laid hold of him I was not aware that the waistcoat was stained with his touch not till I got in doors Q Did any other person touch your waistcoat - A Not at all There was some gentleman took hold of him when I let him go I requested he might not be kept in custody that night I said I knew him very well he was a neighbour I knew where to find him the next morning in consequence of which he was suffered to go at large Q What is he - A He keeps an eating-house I told him he had done an unmanly action and I hoped he would consider of it and prepare himself against the morning he wanted to know what I ment by calling it an unmanly action and seemed to want to fight I told him I wanted no disturbance in the street at all I should not defend myself that way therefore he would be prepared for the next day My wife s clothes at the instant fell to pieces not immediately but in a short time afterwards The next morning I did not take him before the magistrate in consequence of his having gone to Marlborough-street to obtain a warrant against me for assaulting and stopping him in the street I thought it necessary to defend myself I went to Bow-street and got a warrant and had him taken up RICHARD CAVE I am 16 I returned from chapel all the way with Mr and Mrs Bailey I walked all the way behind my mother In consequence of having received information of my mother on the Thursday evening On Sunday evening I saw the prisoner come out of an entry with a phial or something that held liquid in his hand Q Where was that entry - A That is Grosvenor-row it is a cart way to a factory and paper stainers He had a phial and his thumb on the top of the phial when he came out of the entry he was about a yard and a half or rather better from Mrs Bailey Q Were there any other person as near as him to Mrs Bailey - A No I fanoy he watched that opportunity I say him throw the liquid out of the bottle the liquid came some on my mother and some on the ground some fell on my stocking which I instantly felt it come through my stocking and made my leg smart a little This is the stocking the acid is in the stocking now I was so near the prisoner that he nearly tripped me down there was no other person near that could throw it on my mother Upon my screaming out the prisoner hovered over me and said do you say I did it I said yes I will swear it before any magistrate in England I now say upon my oath the prisoner did it Prisoner s Defence I am innocent of the crime The prisoner called six witnesses who gave him the character of a good tempered man GUILTY aged 41 Transported for Seven Years Second Middlesex jury before Mr Common Serjeant

t18500708-1300  1300 ROBERT PATE was indicted for unlawfully assaulting our Lady the Queen with intent to injure her —2nd COUNT with intent to alarm her —3rd COUNT with intent to break the public peace MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL MR SOLICITOR-GENERAL with MESSRS WELSEY BODKIN and CLERK conducted the Prosecution COLONEL GREY I hold the office of equerry to Her Majesty I was equerry in waiting on Thursday 27th June—Her Majesty left Buckingham Palace about six o clock that day in an open barouche of the usual height—it drove up Constitution-hill and down Piccadilly to Cambridge-house where Her Majesty alighted—she left Cambridge-house about half-past six the carriage came out of the east gate the one nearest St James s-street and furthest from Hyde-park—there was at the gate the usual crowd that always attends on such occasions not an unusaal crowd—the carriage necessarily proceeded slowly to enable the leaders to turn into the street it was almost stationary—I saw a well-dressed man step forward as the carriage passed the gates—what he did I could not exactly see—I saw Renwick the footman who was behind lean forward and seize that man by the collar and that man was the prisoner—I was on horseback behind and had not got out of the gate—as I was passing on the prisoner came behind the rumble and the crowd instantly closed in—I saw the police take hold of him and I went after the carriage which drove on—when Her Majesty arrived at Buckingham Palace Sir James Clark was sent for—I afterwards saw a bandage on Her Majesty s forehead and the blood was coming through the bandage ROBERT RENWICK I am sergeant-footman to Her Majesty I am in constant attendance on Her Majesty when driving out On Thursday 27th June Her Majesty went to Cambridge-house—I was sitting behind in the rumble—as the carriage was coming out of the gate I saw the defendant strike the Queen over the head with a small cane this produced is it—I do not know with which end of the cane he struck Her Majesty—the carriage was moving very slowly and I leaned forward and caught him by the collar—I have not the slightest doubt of his being the man—I saw him taken hold of by the crowd—I went on with the carriage Cross-examined by MR COCKBURN Q He was rather roughly handled I believe A Well I cannot say COURT Q Which hand did he hold the cane in A In his right hand JAMES SILVER police-sergeant A I was near Cambridge-house on the evening in question and observed the crowd collected—I observed Her Majesty about to leave the fore-court of Cambridge-house—I heard some exclamation which called my attention to the carriage and I then saw the prisoner with this stick in sis hand—I took it from his right hand—I assisted in protecting him from the violence of the crowd—they would have been very violent to him—one person struck him—I conveyed him to Vine-street station and searched him—he was asked his name he said it was Robert Pate that he lived at 27 Duke-street St James that he was formerly a lieutenant in the 10th Hussars and also of Wisbeach—he said he mast caution those men as to what they were saying that was some of the witnesses who were stating what they had seen for they did not know whether he hit at her bonnet or her head that it was a slight blow with a light stick Cross-examined Q 27 Duke-street is his right place of address is it not A Yes SAMUEL COWLING I am a bookseller living at Norwich-court Fetter-lane On Thursday 27th June about twenty minutes past six o clock I was among the crowd waiting for Her Majesty to leave Cambridge-house—I was standing in the front part of the crowd and the prisoner came and took his station at my right elbow so close as to touch me he made an attempt to get in front of me and I put my arm in front of him again—while standing by the side of him Her Majesty came out in an open barouche and at the moment it was in front of us it halted a second for the outriders to clear the way—we were at the Hyde-park side the right side of the carriage the same on which Her Majesty was sitting and the prisoner made one step in advance and struck Her Majesty—he had his right hand free and he struck with that hand—the blow appeared to me to fall partly on the Queen s bonnet and partly on her face I could not see distinctly COURT Q Was it a violent blow A It was as violent as a man might strike without using any extra exertion—it was not a violent blow still it was a hard blow I should not like it to have come upon my own forehead I confess MR CLERK Q Could you observe when the prisoner raised his hand with the stick whether the blow was aimed in any particular direction A From the prisoner s attitude it is my impression that the blow was so aimed as to fall on the face below the bonnet—it was a sweeping blow rather than a downward blow—I was the first to seize him—I seized him at once and the policeman Silver came up and took him into custody—there were three of the royal children in the carriage with Her Majesty—I do not know which they were Cross-examined Q Were there a good many people there A As near as I can guess 150 or 200—there were persons on each side of us and behind—when he struck the blow the carriage was in front—there was a lady sitting in the front of the carriage facing Her Majesty COLONEL GREY re-examined The Prince of Wales Prince Alfred and I think the Princess Royal were in the carriage with Her Majesty SIR JAMES CLARK I am physician to Her Majesty I was sent for to see Her Majesty between eight and nine o clock in the evening—I examined her forehead and found a considerable tumour on the outer angle of the right brow and a small cut—it had been bleeding and the part was very red—I was surprised to find so much injury produced from so small a stick—it cut through the bonnet—I think it must have been used with considerable force the bonnet was broken in—it was a horse-hair bonnet very thin and elastic—it must have struck on the flat part of the bonnet exactly behind the wire margin Cross-examined Q You assume that the blow was struck through the bonnet A Yes I saw the bonnet and examined it—it was elastic and was in its place when I saw it—the wire round it was bent—I think it impossible for the wire to have assisted in producing the injury because the wire was far beyond where the blow was struck when the bonnet was on the head Witnesses for the Defence COLONEL JOHN VANDELOUR I was Lieutenant-Colonel of the 10th Hussars in 1841 when the prisoner joined it as cornet—he became lieutenant in due time—he remained in the regiment till March 1846—when he joined it was quartered in England we were afterwards a few years in Ireland and then went back to England—about 1844 when we were quartered at Cahir and he at Clonmel an accident happened to some horses and a dog of his—between the time of his joining the regiment and that time I had noticed peculiarities in his manner—the very first day he joined I thought there was something very odd about him—he had his hair cut close to his head and I was under the impression that be had had his head shaved for some complaint and he had rather a wildish look about him—as an officer he discharged his duties very well to the best of his abilities—I never had occasion to find fault with him and as to his being a gentleman there was no doubt about that—he was very much liked by his brother officers and respected by the regiment—he had a favourite Newfoundland dog and I think as many as three valuable horses to which he was very much attached—Major Wallington had then the command of the regiment at Clonmel—it was reported to me that Major Wallington s dog bit Mr Pate s dog and the horses afterwards went mad and were shot—after that I noticed a change in the prisoner s conduct and appearance and there was another circumstance he had a very sensitive mind and he appeared to be exceedingly annoyed at some correspondence that took place between his father and the Duke of Wellington in respect to the loss of these horses—there was some claim made on the Major for the value of the horses in consequence of the accident having arisen through one of his dogs—he felt hurt that his friends should make such a claim on a brother officer—after that he appeared not to have the same love for his profession he did not seem to do his duty with the zeal that he did before—previous to that be used to mix with the other officers—afterwards his life was more secluded and he was in the habit of taking very long walks particularly when he went to Newbridge in very wild secluded places—I cannot speak positively whether he estranged himself more from the company of his brother officers because from my position in the regiment I was not so much among these gentlemen as the junior officers were—some time after that at New-bridge he complained to me that he was unwell and said he had applied to the doctor of the regiment and he had given him no relief—I asked what was the matter with him he answered and said his stomach and bowels were full of bricks and that the doctor had not the skill to remove them—I saw directly the delusion he was under and endeavoured to persuade him what was the fact that the doctor was a person of great ability and be was considered on the sick-list after that—to the best of my knowledge he did not replace the horses—he may have replaced one I cannot speak positively but I had great trouble about them—in June 1845 I sent him from Newbridge with a detachment to Dublin ordering him to return the following day he left the detachment at Dublin without leave absented himself and I was told he went to England—that is a military offence of a serious character—I communicated with General Wyndham on the subject—he came back after some days I forget exactly the number of days he was absent—he was not brought to a court-martial —I saw him after he came back I thought him very wild and he could give no account of himself why he went away—in consequence of what I observed in his conduct and demeanour I made a communication with his father putting it in as delicate a way as I could—I did not like exactly to tell his father that I thought him insane a few months after I think he left the regiment MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q On his return after he had left Dublin did you inquire where he had been A I did and why he absented himself—he told me he had been in England—he did not tell me anything about his father—he did not enter into any particulars further than that he had been to England—I heard that he had been there from another quarter—he was put in arrest for that but did not continue so—after he was released he continued to discharge his military duties as before—I am not certain whether he was on the sick-list when he made that statement to me about the state of his stomach and bowels he was ill—I conclude he was ill otherwise the doctor would not have admitted him on the sick-list—his father claimed compensation of Major Wellington on the ground that his dog had caused the loss to his son and that annoyed Mr Pate who thought it unjust towards his brother officer—allow me to observe that Major Wallington had before the complaint reached him made what everybody conceived to be a very honourable compensation MR COCKBURN Q On his return from England did you ask him the motives of his absence A I asked why be absented himself and he did not seem to know—he was ordered to resume his duty after the arrest ceased—he did not discharge it with his former seal and alacrity but there was a very short time after that for me to judge—I had opportunities of seeing him and the result was that I wrote to his father and he left the regiment COURT Q I suppose according to the usual course in the army an offence of that sort would not be readily passed over in a sane person A I should think not—I do not know what the general s motives were but had I been in his place I should have acted in the same manner—if he had been perfectly sensible I should have adopted quite a different course CAPTAIN EDMUND BENTLET FRITH I am now paymaster of the 13th Light Dragoons I was formerly in the 10th Hussars I joined it in April 1842 about a year after Mr Pate—I was very intimate with him for two or three years—I was quartered at Cahir at the time the accident happened to his horses I heard of it—previous to that I believe he was active in the discharge of his duties as an officer—he was very much liked by everybody—after hearing of that accident I observed a very great change in his manner and appearance it was generally remarked in the regiment—he very often absented himself from mess and took long walks by himself—he told me that he was afraid the cook and messman of the regiment had conspired to poison him—he made that complaint at various times and in different places—he appeared to me to make it seriously as though he believed it COURT Q Using the word poison in the ordinary sense that is killing by poison A Yes Q Not as a person does who has a bad dish A I believe in the first instance he absented himself from mess fearing that the dishes would not agree with him—I fancy that was his first idea—afterwards he spoke to me very seriously on the subject and I believed that he was serious that he was under the impression that the cook and the messman had conspired to poison him—he was afraid to go to mess fearing the dishes were poisoned MR COCKBURN Q You understand the distinction in the question it was not that he feared the dishes would not agree with him but that poison was mixed with them A It was my belief at first that he meant the dishes would not agree with him but after saying it to me at different times and places I then believed he was under the impression that they had engaged to poison him—his manner was that of a man speaking under an impression of that nature COURT Q Did you talk with him about it did you say Why if they would poison you they would poison me and the rest A I did but he still persisted in his opinion that they were in league to poison him—I could not convince him that it would kill other persons as well as him MR COCKBURN Q Did he make complaints to you about the state of his stomach and bowels A I heard him mention the circumstance once when I was in his room at barracks—he stated that he had stones and bricks in his stomach—his manner was at times very reserved and at other times looking very wild and excited without any apparent cause—it was my belief that his mind was impaired from the loss of his horses and dog—it was my impression at the time that that had a great deal to do with his change of manner—I observed this striking change of manner after that event Q Did that altered manner and appearance continue until he left the regiment A It was sot so much after he was released from arrest at least I had not the same opportunities of seeing him—when I did see him I had not opportunities of observing him so closely as I had before—I was not with the regiment when he left I was on leave—he made a present of his uniform and accoutrements to the adjutant of the regiment—I have known parts of an officer s appointments given and I have known the horse given but I never knew a man give the entire of his things—he gave all—on the very afternoon of this unfortunate transaction I met Mr Pate about three o clock in Picca-dilly and I observed that his manner was more excited than usual—he was walking in his usual manner but swinging bis arms and his stick a little more than I had ever seen him do before—he was in the habit of swinging his arms—he has a very peculiar gait—every one used to turn round and look at him—he always carried a small stick I never saw him without—I have frequently seen him since he left the regiment always taking his usual walk between Duke-street and the Parks—I have met him at different hours taking the same walk and always swinging his arms in a peculiar manner but I never saw him in such an excited state as he was at three o clock on the Thursday—I was walking with a friend at that time and we both remarked his appearance COURT Q I suppose you thought his appearance eccentric A I did MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did you speak to him A I did I said How do you do and he gave his usual answer a sort of nod—he recognized me but in a very wild manner—he usually looked wild but he never looked so excited as he did that afternoon—I have called on him in Jermyn-street but finding he did not wish to see any one I discontinued calling on him—I have very often seen him in the street and always spoke or nodded to him—he always walked very upright and swung his arms but not in the manner in which he has done lately—when I first knew him he had a peculiar manner he held himself erect and his manner of walking I think was different from ordinary persons nothing very remarkable—his peculiar manner has become very much exaggerated lately so much so that everybody looked round at him—it was about the same time that he told me about the poisoning that he spoke of having bricks and stones in his inside—he was then quartered at Newbridge Q Was he in fact ill at that time A He was at different times on the sick report but the nature of his disease I am not aware of nothing very serious I fancy for he was only on for short periods—I believe he was perpetually on and off the sick-list—from my position in the regiment I am not able to judge whether he discharged his military duties in the ordinary way—I believe many things were looked over in consequence of his eccentric manner SIR THOMAS MONRO I joined the 10th Hussars in 1842 after Mr Pate—I was quartered with him first at Ballincoli and afterwards at Cahir—I forget whether I saw him in Dublin or not but I saw him at Newbridge after the accident to his horses—he seemed rather more odd in his manner than he had been before—he was always odd—I think his manner and conduct was matter of conversation and observation in the regiment—I have only seen him once since he left the regiment—that was in the Green Park near Piccadilly about the beginning of this year—he was walking down the Park very fast and very upright swinging his arms a great deal THOMAS VENN I am a corporal in the 10th Hussars I was in the regiment when Mr Pate joined it—I had charge of horses in the same stables with his—I remember its being discovered that the horses had been bitten—Mr Pate had a very handsome Newfoundland dog—I am not aware that that was bitten—it was afterwards destroyed because I think there was an order to destroy all dogs at the barracks—it was supposed the horses were bitten—they went mad two or three of them were shot—Mr Pate was very much distressed about his favourite horse what he termed his big horse—that was the second one—he appeared very much distressed about it—previous to the second horse being taken ill he said if anything happened to his big horse he did not know what he should do he should be almost ready to go and make a hole in the river—he spoke it in a laughable sort of manner—I think there was a change in his spirits and manner after the big horse was killed—he did not appear to care so much about the other horse GEORGE PITT I am a sergeant in the 10th Hussars I was in the regiment when Mr Pate was and at the time the accident happened to his horses—he was very much attached to his horses—I observed that he always appeared very much depressed in spirits after the death of the horses and very eccentric in his manner—I have some recollection of his returning to the regiment after he had gone to England without leave—his manner continued eccentric after that—it was always eccentric after the horses had been shot THOMAS MARTIN I am trumpeter of the 10th Hussars I knew Mr Pate when he was in the regiment—after the death of his horses he seemed very solitary—at times when he has come round the troop it hat been generally remarked among the men that he was not right—my mind went along with that observation—I have noticed him sometimes standing moping about as though he was lost in thought and suddenly he would start off at a good pace as though he were walking for a wager—I have seen that on more occasions than one after the death of the horses ROBERT FRANCIS PATE ESQ I am the prisoner s father I remember his leaving the regiment when it was in Ireland and coming home—he came down to me at Wisbeach—it was in 1844—I learnt from him that he had come away without leave—I was astonished to see him and exceedingly hurt and asked him what was the occasion of it—he said that he was hunted by persons in the Dublin streets and he had seen the same persons about the barracks where he had been quartered and he had even seen them about the hotel in London and from Dublin he made his escape into a vessel coming to Liverpool—I said I could not let him remain with me he must return immediately to the regiment I did not know what would he the consequence that he might be shot—I was alarmed on account of his being absent without leave—he promised to go back the next morning—I did not doubt his word or I would have gone back with him—he did go by the first coach next morning and arrived at his quarters—I wrote to the colonel by the same post stating that he had gone and afterwards received a letter from Colonel Vandelour advising me very kindly to take him out of the regiment—I have not got that letter—he had leave and came to London—I met him in London—after he had been in London some little lime he sold his commission without communicating with me—I heard that he was still in London and I knew his time of leave had expired and I came up to London to see after him—I saw him and the first thing I asked was whether he had sold out—he said he had—I then went next morning to the Horse Guards to know the particulars and found it was correct—after paying his debts I understood him that he would have 1 200l left—he kept that money—I was afterwards applied to by persons to whom he had become indebted in London—that was about a year and three quarters after he sold out—I saw him some time after—I had seen him while he was at the lodging in Jermyn-street and I then saw him in Duke-street—his manner then struck me as very remarkable—I was alarmed at it—I first consulted Mr Leveson a medical gentleman of Brighton on the subject and asked him to recommend me a gentleman in London and I then consulted Dr Conolly—at that time I had a daughter living with the family of Mr Startin of Saville-row—I consulted Dr Conolly last autumn—he thought the company of his sister might make him more comfortable and he had better have a little more time he would attend to him when there was anything the matter—he did not see him he thought his presence might do him harm MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q When your son came to you at Wisbeach in 1844 did he tell you himself that he had left without leave A Yes when I said I was apprehensive he might be shot he said he could not help it—he said nothing about his being liable to a court-martial or what the consequences would be—very little conversation passed—I was exceedingly hurt at his coming home—I advised him to go back and he went back—I believe he had 1 200l left after paying his debts or a little more—I think he sold his commission for about 1 800l —I did not see him very often afterwards when he was staying in London—he did not come down to Wisbeach to visit me—he never came down after he sold his commission—he is not at all intemperate in his habits now—I do not know how he went on in the regiment I have no means of knowing—I mean since he has been at his last lodging he has been very temperate—I did not know much about him before I seldom saw him Q After consulting Dr Conolly did you leave your son without any person to watch him or the least consideration A He was in the habit of visiting Mr Startin who is a medical man and I thought anything that took place Mr Startin would tell me of—I made inquiry about him of the persons he lived with from time to time as to how he was going on and the result of my inquiry was that I left him uncontrolled in his lodging—I have always left him in a very dissatisfied state very uncomfortable about him but I did not know what steps to take to put him into an asylum I did not know what to do I always believed that he would go into an asylum—I had nobody to attend to or watch him but the people of the house where he lodged—I had no control over him—he is my only son COURT Q He did not come down to you when you were high sheriff of Cambridgeshire which I well remember A No that is about three years ago MR COCKBURN Q He assigned no motive for coming from Ireland but that people were pursuing him in Dublin streets A Yes that there was a conspiracy CHARLES DODMAN I was formerly in the 10th Hussars and was servant to Mr Pate a portion of the time he was in the regiment that was after the loss of his horses—I noticed his conduct and manner it was always very strange and eccentric not like other people—I accompanied him when he went with a detachment from Newbridge to Dublin some accident had happened to a horse on its voyage and it was killed—he went to Morrison s hotel Dublin—he left me there and went away without giving me any intimation I subsequently found he had gone to England—he came back in about seventeen or eighteen days to the regiment at Newbridge—his conduct after that was dull and more melancholy than before he secluded himself all he could—he was very much liked by every man in the regiment—I was afterwards engaged by him in March 1846 as his servant after he had left the regiment he was then living at 43 Great Marlborough-street and in one or two days afterwards he went to Jermyn-street—while he was at Jermyn-street in 1847 he was thrown from his horse he had no medical man to attend him for that—his habits were very regular in Jermyn-street—he rose at seven and first had a very large basin of water which would hold about four gallons and put his head into it he then had a bath and into that he put whiskey and camphor half a pint every morning to about ten pails of water sufficient to cover his body—two ounces of camphor mixed with a pint and a half of whiskey served him for three mornings—while he was dressing I have heard him making noises and shouting particularly in the bath COURT Q What sort of shouts were they A Like a person going suddenly into the water and losing their breath it was so much that all the persons in the house noticed it—it was as much as to say it was very cold MR HUDDLESTON Q Was it merely just at the moment he went in or did it continue A It continued and sometimes he would sing—it was not an annoyance to the people in the house it was rather an amusement the servants used to stand and listen to him—he did not mix at all in society in Jermyn-street he lived by himself—the blind of the room he was in was always down every minute he was in—he lived on the first floor—he used to go out for a walk regularly—I believe he always went in the same direction—I did not go with him—he went out in a cab always at a certain hour and he would go to the minute—his father and his sister have been with him and other things happened to hinder him but nothing would stop him from going at the very moment the chimes of St James went a quarter to three in the afternoon and at a quarter to twelve in the morning he went to dress—he had the same cab man and he paid him ten shillings for his fare for some time all in shillings and afterwards it was reduced to nine shillings—I was obliged to be very particular in getting all shillings—he would never take a half-crown or a sixpence but he would have a sixpence and a large penny to pay the bridge and gates—he would never have a small penny or halfpence—I was obliged to have sixpence and a penny in one place and the nine shillings in another and put them in separate places on the mantel-piece in the drawing-room in the same place every day—the shillings were laid on the top of each other and the first thing he would do when he came in would be to count them—when he took them up I believe he used to place them in his pocket with the heads all one way and I believe the heads were up when he paid the cab man—he never altered his style of dress according to the heat or coldness of the weather—he would have a fire in the summer-time except for about two or three months the very hot weather—he used to have one in his bedroom also—he had the cab for about eighteen months—I never but once knew him to receive company MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Upon what occasion was it that he received company A On the Derby-day one gentleman dined with him who had gone with him to the Derby—that was in 1847—he was regular in the payment of his bills—large bills were settled quarterly or half-yearly—he used to keep the receipts—I have seen him put the large ones away—he paid his lodgings and my wages very regularly—he was very regular in his habits he had a very wild and strange way so that everybody would notice him Q What do you mean by that in what respect A He would be very punctual and so very noisy he would whistle about the house and throw himself about in walking—he walked very erect and threw his arms about—he would think repeatedly of having things made or done which I had very great difficulty in getting and sometimes I could not meet with them—at one time he wanted an ivory pestle-and-mortar made in the shape of a bell to grind tooth-powder—I got it for him and he ground charcoal and camphorated chalk in it—he once wanted me particularly to get a piece of wood to match a gun-stock to make a watch-stand it was a pretty piece of solid walnut-tree—I could not get it without ordering it—it struck me as being extraordinary—at the time he was at Morrison s Hotel at Dublin I asked whether he was going out to dine he said be should not know till three o clock—I went at three o clock and he had not made up his mind and told me to come at nine at night—I thought that a very late hour to go to New-bridge and when I came I found he had gone out to dine MR COCKBURN Q He left you behind when he came to England without orders A Yes—his whistling and singing was very peculiar it was in general one thing—I never heard any one else shout and make noises as he did in the bath—his manner was different from other people—I was with him nearly two years his manner and conduct was matter of observation and conversation to the people in the house COURT Q Did he read books at all while he was in the house A Yes and the newspaper—on one occasion I saw the catalogue of books at Russell Smith s in Old Compton-street and one of the books he had was Nursery Rhymes he purchased it to read and read it through—he gave it to me for my child—I thought it a strange book for a gentleman to read—I have seen him with many books—he read Hogarth s works—he did not read the Bible I never knew him go to Church or any place of worship—he used to walk and ride on Sunday just the same as any other day BAKER LEE I drive a Hansom s cab—I was in the habit of driving Mr Pate—I think I began to do so some time in November 1847—it was while he lived at 89 Jermyn-street—I fetched him regularly every day at one time a quarter-past three o clock—I was obliged to be there punctual to the minute—I was there before he always came punctual to the minute—I always drove him the same way down the Brompton-road over Putney-bridge and up to Putney-heath always to one spot a small hill of grass where be used to get out and cross a small ditch and walk direct round the heath always among the thickest of the furze and gorse bushes never on the footpaths—he always walked round at the back out of my sight for about ten minutes and I used to go along the road and meet him again when he had had his walk at one particular spot near a pond which he used to pass in his walk and he would frequently stop there and stand and notice it for a few minutes and then run and jump into the cab—he would sometimes order me to go as fast as I could gallop and then he would pull me up and order me to walk down Roehampton-lane—I then used to take him to Barnes-common—he used to get out at one certain place there and take a regular walk over the common among the furze-bushes and briars—I used to take him up again at a certain point always the same point and then drive him home—he would sometimes stop at a nursery-garden and buy 1d -worth of flowers we always came the same road home over Hammersmith-bridge—his manner was very peculiar in the cab—his manner of ordering me first to gallop then to stop and jumping from one side of the cab to the other—as I sat behind I used to open the trap and look through my curiosity was very much excited—it used to be dark in winter-time driving down Roehampton-lane a large avenue of trees it would be dark before we got to Barnes-common—he would walk through the furze-bushes there in the dark hail rain blow or snow—while in the cab he would sometimes jump and start very much and sometimes he would sit still and never stir the whole journey—he used to have a small cane with him which he used to flourish about this way and that way—I cannot say whether this is the cane looking at the one produced —it was similar to it if it was not that—he would lay on the front of the cab and take the cane and cut it this way and that way—I do not know what performance it was he seemed to be thoughtless or something of that kind—I suppose some sudden thought caused him to jump and start as if he did not know what he was about—many respectable people on the road would stop me in their carriage and gentlemen on horseback to ask who or what he was whether he was not a madman—this lasted every day for fifteen or eighteen months without any interruption whatever might be the weather and Sunday the same—he used to pay me every day when I brought him home—at first it was 10s and afterwards reduced to 9s —I do not know how it came to be reduced—he said to me one day that he should only give me 9s —he paid me with the 9s and he contined on paying that and I never contradicted it as it was a sufficient remuneration for the journey—he always paid me in shillings never anything but shillings and they were always placed with the man upwards and all the men s faces one way COURT Q How did he pay you so that you could see that A I used to notice them after I took them out of his hand—he handed them to me all in a lump not one by one one on the top of the other and dropped them down into my band—the toll at Putney was 6d and at Hammersmith 4d and 3d at Stamford-bridge gate which made it 1s and 1d —he used to have 10s every day and 1d and the shilling and the penny-piece always laid on the seat I could see that—it was not two sixpences for the toll—I believe it was 1s he gave at Stamford-bridge gate—the persons at the cab-stand and where my cab stood used to make observations about Mr Pate and very singular observations too MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Why was it you left off driving him A Because he could not afford to ride any longer—he did not tell me so he gave me no reason—when I went the next day the valet told me that Mr Pate did not want me and if he wanted me he would send for me—sometimes when he went through the furs✗e and gorse-bushes I have seen his clothes as wet as if he had been in a pond—he appeared very pleased at a hail-storm if he was walking—I did not make a bargain with him at first—he gave me 10s without asking the price—I cannot say what my proper fare would be—I know what the legal fare would be but going off the stones we sometimes demand more—9s might suit me better to-day than 10s tomorrow—the fare would be 9s 4d —he had rather the best of me by the 9s payment but it was very suitable to me—it was two hours a day regularly to a minute COURT Q When was the last time you drove him A About two years ago CHARLES MASON I keep a livery-stable in Dyson s-yard Park-lane I have known Mr Pate for some years—he had horses from me from the summer of 1846 up to the first week in Nov 1846—he then had an accident with one of them—the horse fell and threw him as he came in at the Victoria-gate late one evening—since the spring of 1847 I have seen him in the winter about twice a week and in the summer about three times a week passing my place in Park-lane and in Piccadilly as near two o clock in the day as possible—lately my attention has been very much attracted to a strangeness in his appearance and manner—there was not that gentlemanly friendly acknowledgment that he used to me but a great deal of irritability and especially in the middle of May so that I told my foreman I had great apprehensions that Captain Pate as I always called him was losing his senses—there was a very marked change to when I first knew him—he was wild in appearance and it seemed as if he was annoyed by the attention that I always considered due to him being a customer—he used to return it very friendly formerly How do you do Mason and lately he would wave his stick in his hand JAMES STARTIN ESQ I am a surgeon living in Saville-row In 1849 a sister of Mr Pate s came to live in my family for a time—I think Mr Pate came with her the first time—I had seen him previously to that—I first noticed him in the winter of 1848—I was walking with my wife in Kensington-gardens and he passed me—she drew my attention to him and I said It is a poor insane man —I observed so great a peculiarity about his appearance and manner that I told my wife not to attract his attention for fear of the consequences—he was walking in a strange manner at rather a rapid pace throwing his arms about and throwing his legs out in rather an extraordinary manner—he did not walk like anybody else and his look was odd—he neither looked much to the right or left—it was the look of a man whose mind was not perfect—I saw him afterwards from time to time about town and his manner always struck me—I did not at that time know who he was—I did not recognize him the first time he came with his sister I did the second time I saw him—he came to my house about eight or ten times while his sister was living there that is I saw him eight or ten times—I had opportunities of conversing with him on a few occasions—his conversation was very peculiar—there was nothing very remarkable about it certainly—there were no insane remarks—occasionally he used to start subjects and leave them off very abruptly and occasionally he would throw a degree of energy into what he said that did not at all correspond with the subject and then at once he would cease from conversation and retire in a sort of sulky manner—I have seen a great many insane persons and I should put him down as such—his conversation was not that of a rational man in the perfect command of his senses—there was no delusion—the only delusion I think I might mention was that on one occasion there were some gentlemen rather eminent for classical attainments in my room and I was trying to persuade him to qualify himself for a classical education as he had given up the army and he said he did not think there was any man in England of sufficient classical attainments to give him an education or to teach him and of course I ceased the conversation at once—I had at one time for three years opportunities of seeing insane persons at the Birmingham Infirmary a parochial establishment and all the recent insane cases came under my eye for that period—the result of his manner and conversation was to produce an impression on my mind that his father ought to be communicated with and I did communicate with him MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Are you any connexion or relation of the prisoner s A No relation my brother married his sister—that was in 1849—that was the sister that came to reside with me COURT Q How came she to come to you A I have known Mr Pate senior for some years—it was a matter of friendship—she did not come to live with me because I was a medical man MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q When was it you made the communication to the father A In Nov 1849—I think he had previously seen Dr Conolly—I am not aware that he did anything in consequence of my communication MR COCKBURN Q Did you give the father any recommendation as to following the advice of Dr Conolly A I forget whether the father informed me whether he had seen Dr Conolly or not but I told the father it would be well not to excite him or I thought there might be some rashness—I meant that he might commit some act upon himself or his relatives—I advised that his father should soothe him GEORGE FEARON GARDINER I was on duty as beadle at the Burlington Arcade—I have while there noticed Mr Pate at different times—I have always looked at him when he came in and looked after him—I have seen him cutting away with his stick sometimes backwards and sometimes forwards and I imagined he was not altogether right in his senses—I have seen him stop at a window and look round as if somebody was after him and then start off as fast as he could go—sometimes gentlemen have asked me if I knew him and who he was and said he appeared like a madman—his manner was very eccentric JOHN SQUIRE police-inspector I have known Mr Pate about town for some time—my attention has been attracted to him by his eccentric walk about the streets—he was wild in gesture and peculiar in his gait—I have looked round and wondered who he was—his manner was such as to attract attention in passing along—he had a peculiar action of sometimes putting his hand in his waistcoat—I never saw him without a stick and he used to pass it backwards and forwards as he passed through the streets—I never saw him hit the passengers—in consequence of his manner I used to call him Old Cut-and-Thrust MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q How long have you observed this A I cannot say exactly—I have been in the present division fourteen years and two months and I have been constantly in the habit of seeing him several times a day—I have observed this eccentric and wild manner since the commencement of the present year—I did not report it—I did not consider there was anything to report I considered him harmless—I never saw him watched by the police JOHN MULLING I am gate-keeper at the Buckhill-gate Kensington gardens I have seen Mr Pate come through about two years or two years and a half ago—he came soon after one always within a few minutes of the same time—he used to walk in an unusual sort of way throwing himself about and swinging his stick about—he attracted my attention and that of those who were passing at the time—I never saw him speak to any person only staring about—it is about two years and a half ago since I first saw him and I noticed him till I lost sight of him soon after the account of what happened to Her Majesty I think the day after THE O GORMAN MAHON M P I have known Mr Pate between ten and eleven months—I have seen him occasionally at Mr Startin s and elsewhere—I have frequently had opportunities of conversing with him—from the first day I saw him I had an impression on my mind that he was not a sane man—that impression was confirmed almost on every subsequent interview so much so that it became matter of conversation between myself and my companions—his manner appearance and conversation all led me to that conclusion MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You have associated with him I presume A I have occasionally—I found him very much alive to the feelings of a gentleman Q And knowing what he was about A He possesses that species of instinct which guides animals and so far as that I should say he did know what he was about—I think from his education and habits he would shrink from doing an ungentlemanly or dishonourable act knowing it to be wrong COURT Q You think he would not do a wrong act because he would know it to be wrong A Certainly MR COCKBURN Q Do you think he would do a disloyal act or an act of this kind if he knew it to be wrong A He was the last man in the world who I should suppose would be guilty of a disloyal act THE REV CHARLES DRISCOLL I live at 60 Sloane-street and am lecturer at Bow Church Middlesex I have known Mr Pate by sight from a year to a year and a half—I afterwards became personally acquainted with him at Mr Startin s—before that my attention had been called to him by his appearance and manner and I had formed an opinion as to his state of mind before my introduction to him—I afterwards had conversation with him and saw him at Mr Startin s—the opinion I had formed as to his state of mind was not altered by that—my opinion was that be was not in his sound senses—on the 27th June I was going to dine at the Army and Navy Club and as I was going there in an omnibus I saw Mr Pate about six o clock standing at the west side of the east gate of the Duke of Cambridge s house—he stood quietly for about two or three minutes the omnibus was going slowly by at the time and then he turned round and walked westward towards Hyde-park Corner and though I had met him often in the street yet there was something peculiar in the manner in which he turned about then and walked away that made me look through the window after him and to take particular notice of him—he threw his heels up in a much more extravagant manner than usual—he generally wore his coat wide open as if he wished to air his chest and he threw his coat back violently and threw his heels up—he appeared more excited than usual—I did not notice his look particularly but his manner—I did not see any stick he generally threw his coat back and that concealed the stick on that occasion from my view—I dined at the Army and Navy Club and there I heard of this occurrence MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did he always throw his coat back in walking A Always whenever I saw him and threw out his heels in such a way that it was astonishing how he preserved his equilibrium—he walked very erect with his coat thrown back and raising his heels and throwing them forward in a very extravagant manner—I have met him in society—I have not conversed with him much he was sulky and reserved in his manner—it was more in manner and appearance than insanity of conversation—he bad a short chopping manner of answering and a very peculiar expression of face—I have met him at an evening party taking tea in a domestic way—I have not met him frequently—my impression is that I have met him two or three times but I can only say with certainty that I have met him once JOHN CONOLLY ESQ M D I have devoted my attention very much to the subject of insanity—I am physician to the Hanwell Lunatic Asylum—I have seen Mr Pate since his committal only—I was applied to by his father in Nov last and the circumstances of the case were stated to me including events for some time past—I was aware at that time that his sister was in London and that he had been brought into communication with her last winter and I thought from what was told me that he was rather improving in his habits beginning to go into society a little more and probably if I was introduced to him it might produce an evil excitement causing him to set off again and give trouble to his friends consequently I thought it would be better I should not see him—I recommended a postponement of anything of that kind for the present—I have seen him three times since his committal—I have conversed with him on the subject of this transaction—I tried particularly to understand what his motive could have been in doing it or what his state of mind could have been at the time—in my opinion he is a person of unsound mind—I form that opinion from the communication I have had with him personally together with all the circumstances which I have heard detailed in the course of the case but certainly to a considerable degree from the conversations I have had with him—it appears to me that in his present state he presents an example of what is not at all uncommon to me of persons who are very devoid of mental power who have a very small share of mental power who consequently persevere in no pursuit have no object and are unfit for all the ordinary duties of life Q Have you sufficient of data before you to form a judgment as to whether he is capable of discriminating between right and wrong A I should say in conversation with him if you were to speak of an action that was decidedly right or wrong he would very clearly understand it as clearly as I should myself—I should think it would be particularly part of his state of mind to be liable at any sudden excitement to have the malady considerably aggravated from the want of stronger control MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Do I understand you to say he is not a man of strong mind A Yes wanting in earnestness of intention on any subject indifferent apathetic Q I am afraid that is the characteristic of a great number of persons who are perfectly sane and at large A At large I doubt about their being perfectly sane—of course the line must be drawn somewhere but I take all the circumstances into consideration in this case COURT Q Do you perceive any specific delusion at all A Not at present no delusion whatever MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q And I presume he is well aware that he has done wrong in this matter A Yes and regrets it very much MR COCKBURN Q You gather that from what he has said to you on the subject A I do—he seems quite unable to give any account why he did it or any account of the act at all any more than it was not done by another person—he does not deny having done it but he expresses himself very sorry for it—I asked him a great many questions on the subject he had no motive whatever in committing such an action no premeditation no powers of deliberation or reason at the time but he acted under some strange morbid impulse which he had no power apparently of resisting EDWARD THOMAS MONRO ESQ M D I have had five interviews with Mr Pate since this occurrence—I saw him first on the 2nd of the month at Clerkenwell and again on the 3rd and I saw him afterwards in Newgate on the 5th 8th and 10th—from my own observation and from what I have heard to-day I believe him to be of unsound mind—from his own lips I have heard a statement of what occurred in 1844 in Ireland how he came away driven by his own imagination that he was watched that he was persecuted and I have no doubt in the world that he was then labouring under a delusion—I have heard the opinion which Dr Conolly has given to-day—I do not remember precisely all the points of his evidence—I agree generally with him certainly COURT Q Do you agree with that part of his evidence in which he says there is no specific delusion A At this time I am not aware that there is any MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q And that he was aware he was doing wrong in doing this act A Very possibly aware—a madman might choose the wrong and do the act perversely—there are a great many degrees in madness—I think the characteristic of his is a morbid love of seclusion no friends no pursuits no object in life that is what I find continually what I should call an unsound state of mind Q Is he in your judgment capable of distinguishing between right and wrong A In many things certainly MR COCKBURN Q Is that apathetic state of mind listlessness and inconstancy consistent with occasional paroxysms of excitement A Oh yes—the whole history that I have heard to-day is quite conclusive to my mind of his being in an unsound condition—I think that a man conceiving
